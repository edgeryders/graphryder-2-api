One in politically and economically bankrupt Soviet republic, one in 50-years old power plant built in seismic zone. Reversing your argument, there's ~450 operating civilian nuclear reactors in the world and 99% of them had no safety issues ever and the total number of fatalities from these accidents does not exceed ~50.\n\nAt the same time, [dam failures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dam_failure) have just killed 217 people in Brazil (2019), 75 in Russia (2009) and 171'000 in China (1975), just to enumerate the largest ones. Coal ash piles (also slighly radioactive) contaminate thousands of hectars, polluting ground and water. Same applies t oil and gas drilling sites. Oh yes, but it's nuclear power plants that are \"deadly\".\n\n[quote=\"trythis, post:13, topic:11634\"]\nI have argued it would be considerably worse if you take the socio-technicnologic competency in many less developed places into account\n[/quote]\n\nI would argue that \"less developed places\" do not care at all about your concerns and they are, and will be satisfying their energy needs by any means possible, just as Iran or aforementioned Bangladesh does. Just as they do not care about conservative, pseudo-scientific dialectics like \"precautionary principle\" and [successfully invest into Bt brinjal](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0205713) simply to survive. \n\nAnd as someone who was born in a \"less developed\" country (70's Poland) I fully sympathize with their aspirations. The fundamental problem I have with people speaking of \"investing into renewables\" is that the very definition of \"investment\" assumes for-profit operations and ROI, which essentially means that there's a group of *already* wealthy countries that have developed advanced renewable technology sectors and are now expecting poorer countries to buy these from them. Which is not happening, because the latter don't run outdated and dirty power plants just because they *like* to, but because they lack funds for investments. \n\nI guess I'd like to see more of [Jonas Salk approach to polio vaccine](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2012/08/09/how-much-money-did-jonas-salk-potentially-forfeit-by-not-patenting-the-polio-vaccine/) here and cooperated, international effort on just making clean energy *available and affordable* to everyone rather than use it as a competitive advantage.\n\n[quote=\"trythis, post:13, topic:11634\"]\nPick a dozen from [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index#Medium_human_development) or belwo, and have a few on there that will get hit hard by climate change. For example Bangladesh would sure like to have some nukes.\n[/quote]\n\nAnd the rest of the world should help them get one, perhaps one of the [Russian floating ones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akademik_Lomonosov) as they are safe, reliable and are mobile.

I've followed US climate politics closely for many years and have lobbied in Ireland for carbon dividends as a member (and Irish coordinator) of Citizens Climate Lobby. \n\nTo expand on the quote above, there are essentially 3 ways to price carbon. The first, trading systems, has been tried and found not to work very well. That leaves straight carbon tax (even if imposed as a 'price floor' on trading systems), and there are 2 models of carbon tax, differing by who gets the money. The first, tax-and-subsidise, involves government taxing carbon and then spending the money on carbon saving programs. Everybody's costs and prices go up, and the government decides who gets the money. The second way to tax carbon is by returning the proceeds of the tax equally to all. That way everybody's costs and prices go up, but everybody also gets a cheque in the post. Most people come out ahead (making it politically possible), the poor benefit the most (satisfying the socialists), and the government is largely kept out of it (satisfying the capitalists). And the core human values of freedom, equality and fairness are reinforced. \n\nOld-style, market freedom-loving American (and other) conservatives who recognise scientific reality support carbon dividends because, while they are even more aware of the importance of a price on carbon than the Left are, they don't like government, don't trust government, and don't think government is efficient or effective at micro-managing the market that we depend on for our modern, globalised, high-tech lives. As somebody whose outstanding electricity bill includes a carbon tax used to give rich people \u20ac5,000 grants to buy \u20ac100,000 EVs, I tend to agree with them. Government often does not pick-and-choose either fairly or effectively (after all, there's \u20ac5,000 grants for \u20ac100,000 EVs, but not a penny for someone who has never owned a car).\n\nThere's no 'American consensus' around anything, but polls show people ahead of politicians on climate (especially among the young) and some of the world's best climate scientists, activists, organisations, businesses, thinkers, etc. come from the United States. Of course there's stupid, irrational, self-defeating and very powerful US resistance to climate/carbon action, and there's no guarantee of anything. Maybe America's future is a decent into a hell hole under Trumpian rule? Who knows? But it's undeniable that there is a serious policy movement towards carbon dividends coming largely (but not entirely) from the American political center-right (or what's left of it). I can also tell you from both national and EU-wide experience that there is very little awareness of carbon dividends as a policy option in Europe (although CCL's 22 European chapters are doing what they can).\n\nI think we need a new term: Political Denial. By this I mean the denial of the reality of politics by academics, NGOs, think tanks, grantees and all the other apparatus of the multi-billion euro climate, sustainability and social transformation industry. The reality of politics is that the Afd are now the second largest party in Germany, that Macron is less popular in France than Trump in in the US, and that the UK has tied itself into a self-absorbed Brexit knot. I don't know what country you live in but I do know that, whatever country it is, your country too has rising 'populists' and a rising anger at the dysfunction and unfairness of the business-as-usual status quo - all overhung by a background of environmental despair. I know that your country's politics are changing too. That's because the core causes and the 'system's' inability to address these core problems are similar everywhere.\n\nMaybe it would only take a deep conversation at a critical cocktail party, and everything would change. After all, at a time when the thinking world is screaming out for a \"new economic paradigm\" one is already emerging in front of our eyes, with existing cross-political and expert support, based on evidence, politically and institutionally realistic and possible, just waiting to be connected into a coherant and widely communicable whole. One consultation and discussion process, one week of focused and facilitated discussion, and one social platform incentivising focused action might have a chance. I mean, if Hayek managed to do it, it can be done again.\n\nBut right now there's more chance of getting funding for \"raising awareness of climate through the medium of interpretative dance\", or for walking to the North Pole to draw attention to the fate of polar bears, or for writing an obscure paper about how climate change threatens farmer's mental health -  than there is of getting funding to develop and influence the core political-economics ideas and politics behind climate change itself  (and the same goes for inequality, etc.). If there is ever a deep conversation at a critical cocktail party that changes everything, I'll bet that conversation will essentially be about one person convincing another person that an idea is important enough to let go of a little money. And that idea will be a real, defined political idea encompassing practical, specific, implementable policies.\n\nBecause anything else would just be more empty, vacuous, safe, vague, risk-averse, business-as-usual, normal, respectable, mediocre and ultimately suicidal horse manure. And that's well-funded already.", "created_at": "2018-09-28 17:05:43.266207", "updated_at": "2018-09-28 17:05:43.266207", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 919, "wiki": false, "reads": 37, "score": 82.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [47611], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 63, "user_id": 4922, "topic_id": 44, "post_number": 1, "raw": "The Edgeryders website is authored by its contributors and maintained by Edgeryders O\u00dc.

Born and raised in Cairo, i attended the German School (DEO). This school is special in that it provides a completely germanised experience from childhood; sort of shaped me to be a hybrid between german culture and my own. I attended the American University in Cairo (AUC) after, studying the unlikely combination of Economics and Rhetoric &amp; Composition. The first proper proper Egyptian institution to hold me was my obligatory military service after (Hello there\u00a0<a href=\"/u/hazem\" style=\"font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.7;\">@Hazem</a>); I started serving during the rather turbulent time of Summer 2013.\u00a0\n\nThe Egyptian revolution was during my second year at studies. A pivot; the way it was for everybody! I saw hope, I saw activism. During that time my university witnessed turbulence between workers strikes and student uprisings. The latter is strange for a posh international institution, yet I saw in it a student body taking ownership of its host institution in a way unparalleled within the wider Egyptian Higher Education landscape. The AUC administration might be a tough, but AUC has proven freer and more malleable than any Egyptian public university and most private ones.\u00a0\n\nPersonally, I engaged myself as a student representative fighting towards lower tuition; a don quixote quest in an american higher-ed. The activism paid off: During a student strike in September 2012 that shut off the university, a proposal I had co-authored created resulted in a student-adminstration agreement, eventually lowering tuition fees and re-opneing the university.\u00a0\n\n----\n\nChange can be large, uni comes to mind, or small. I cycle everyday in Cairo. Either way, change\u00a0<span>needs a drive and a feeling of ownership.</span>\u00a0I recently ran into the Edgeryders platform and got intrigued by its approach to work<span>.\u00a0</span>Currently I am candidate for a Masters programme come September in Urban Science &amp; informatics. Until then, I will be working on a personal research project (Check <a href=\"/t/egypt-in-numbers/601\">here</a>) in addition to Edgeryders. I am looking forward to conversing and meeting with more people from the community.\u00a0\n\nFeel free to hit me up at any time,\u00a0\n\nCheers Y'all :)\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-20 08:54:49", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:24.975137", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 451, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 55971, "user_id": 4779, "topic_id": 9951, "post_number": 4, "raw": "All right", "created_at": "2019-07-01 14:20:36.806780", "updated_at": "2019-07-01 14:20:36.806780", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [55970], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 79983, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 14024, "post_number": 4, "raw": "ping @lroddy", "created_at": "2020-07-06 14:05:46.462334", "updated_at": "2020-07-06 14:05:46.462334", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 13.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [79982], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 50916, "user_id": 4022, "topic_id": 9483, "post_number": 12, "raw": "@brooks and I are talking about this on Monday.", "created_at": "2019-02-16 15:39:44.771020", "updated_at": "2019-02-16 15:39:44.771020", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 9, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 7.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 63610, "user_id": 4664, "topic_id": 11459, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Hello, @nadia thank you for your kind welcome! \n\nI have been experiencing the old version of the community calls with Hazem and Zmorda last year when I was about to launch a crazy idea. Their inputs were super helpful for me to refine my career path at that time. \n\nThe challenge idea comes from our partner ZINDI. As you may know when it comes to data science fields, we have to check first the availability of the data. \n\nOur main purpose is to showcase that it is possible to solve social-environmental problems using data science and we are looking for the best use-case. This why we have chosen to use the data collected by Ocean order to rescue sea turtles.\n\nHowever, in **Tunisia**, we have useful available data but unfortunately it's not public so we need to be a more structured community so government and NGOs can trust us and make their data available for next competitions or other uses.\n\nFor the **data science academy**, @Meds.jedidi1 and I have been participating as mentors on the ML study jam organized by Google and Instadeep. During the training sessions we had been in touch with young people and even professionals having a hunger for knowledge. \n\nWe have concluded that attending different online available courses is not enough to succeed in one's professional transition or get an internship in this new field. Multiple reasons may cause that. first of all, having access to a high quality training courses is costly and most of the cases not affordable (you have to pay in USD, not in TND).

About the event**\nThis [event](https://edgeryders.eu/t/hack-4-environment-medenine/11368) was part of the Edgeryders festival ad the hackathon series lead by @Sohayeb, that worked on the SDG goals, you may find more details in Sohayeb's [post](https://edgeryders.eu/t/hack-4-environment-medenine/11368) . \nThis event was the only one in this festival that was worked in a region and not the capital, which is something I truly appreciate, as I believe that we should always work in the regions, and not i the places were there is already loads of opportunities.\n**2. Event agenda:**\n![Hack%204%20Environment%20Medenine%20Program(1)|487x690](upload://5Xdt3wndBlOlG4JFu6yXk9bvz1P.png) \n\n\n**3. Project list:** \n1. [Clean City:](https://edgeryders.eu/t/hack-4-environment-medenine-cleancity/11843)\na. A platform that collects the wastes and recycle it through composting.\nb. Name of team members are @Yemna and @Mouna  . \nc. the major discussions were about the Tunisian Laws concerning this issue and how can we adapt their project to our legal structures, and how can we focus on who will be the partners that they will be dealing with.\n**2. [3 - R Tech Recycle](https://edgeryders.eu/t/hack-4-environment-medenine-3-r-tech-recycle/11842).**\na. A Platform that connects the different institutions and regular people, to collect and resell the wastes after recycling them in this platform, they are working on different kind of wastes.\nb. Names of the team members: @haykel @hadir @amira \nc. The major discussions were about how to make this platform sustainable and how can it grow more in the future, how can they reach more people and the way it should be functioning.\n\n**The other two projects team did not submit their ideas.**\n\n\n**4. General remarks**\n\u25cf I learned more about the Tunisian Laws that works or blocks the start ups that may work on these SDGs\n\u25cf I found both two teams enthusiastic and they developed well their ideas, however the 3 R recycle was the one that I felt was not missing any detail and the team harmony was so strong, they were professional.\n\u25cf The two teams that did not submit their ideas were unsure of the way the selected profiles will win, the idea that they will have to go through two selections (OCI LAB and the hackathon) made them a bit confused knowing that some of them are fresh graduates who work as freelance with different organizations and associations on environmental issues, they weren't sure of the outputs of the hackathons and how the slection process is going to be like, they had a great project idea that Idon't have their permission to share it here, but it is super promising, so I think we should have worked more to keep their interest..\n\n**5. Stats**\na. Number of total participants: 15 \nb. Gender balance: 10 Males / 5 Females \n**6. Recommendations:**\nFocus more on working in the regions ,the capital and big cities are already full of these experiences and opportunities.\nThe structure need to be clear from the very start and should not be changed after the official launch.\n**7.

Maybe I still get fined, but I am better equipped for my court hearing. \n\n\n### Actionables: \n\n* @markomanka  to ask for WHO endorsement on this.\n* As soon as we have that (or they say no) we coordinate on doing the application that @nadia mentioned. We put some money on community managers/interviewers, running the community infrastructure? \n\n\n### More info and reflections \n\nThe epidemics has an epistemic dimension. Phylosophically, the idea of \"evidence-based medicine\" (or -policy, or -whatever), forgets that *evidence, in science, is not dogma*. It is *the opposite* of dogma; it comes in to change, and enrich, our way of thinking. It renegotiates the analysis of the situation with respect to the rest of reality. In an interlocked system, reality has many ways to kill you: if you shut down the economy to fight the epidemics, people might die anyway, because infrastructures fall into disrepair. It *does* make sense to weigh the health benefits of lockdown against its economic costs. This is *not*  necessarily the same thing as being inhuman, or greedy.\n\n1. Marco talks to firstline doctors, who are completely lost.\n2. Simona is more focused on the mistakes made at the level of health education (what are vaccines, how do they operate?) and community engagement (people only see repression, and repression is the only thing there is because there was no preparedness, no participation in creating contingency plans etc.). Guidelines exist (not obviously for *this* virus, but for similar hypothetical vira); community experiences also exist (Ebola), but they were not applied. \n3. There is a medical level and a societal level. At the medical level, doctors take orders from bosses. At the societal level, society takes advice from doctors. Or it should. Instead, a repressive system kicks in: staying in is bad for health, but it makes police control easier. Hospital doctors, in Italy, have underwritten this idea, that has no medical grounding whatsoever. However, society pushes back: we only see repression, we do not see active work waiting for solutions, and this reduces the legitimacy of the leadership. \n4.

My high level thoughts:\n\n1. How is \"remote professionalism\" different from \"in-situ professionalism\"?\n\n2. What works better remotely, what works worst? What to do about it?\n\n3. What are common remote, or hybrid scenarios one could optimize around? \n(E.g. working out of coffee shop, working out of permanent personal work room/corner, bringing remote participants into a live conference like event)\n\nOn number 1. I have a general link to Pamela Hinds with whom I've discussed some of this. It may not be mindblowing, but it'll help bring out points one should be sensitive towards imo (you can watch this later, maybe start at 18:00)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/LxAcHpCuCtE\n\nIf you noticed, the video above really does not have a good audio quality. If we recognize that this still happens to absolute experts, we can see how far we likely are away from a \"good practice\" being followed by the majority of us.\n\nAs second video I'd like to offer (which you absolutely show watch now!) is a horribly realistic account of how a significant portion of meetings go. If you are serious about a collab, try to avoid that like you would coming to a meeting with an open fly, a missing shoe, and a torn shirt - it just doesn't make a good impression on people who are serious about making something work.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/DYu_bGbZiiQ\n\nOf course as @johncoate says you should be cutting people a lot more slack, if they seem to make an effort. I think he is very correct! Jump to minute 10 for an analysis leading to a \"generous tit-for-tat\":\nhttps://youtu.be/i3plwTxdSO4\n\nWe have sooo much less contextual information on people's background so we're likely to attribute some of their failings to them, when it really was their circumstances mostly. Think about e.g. someone getting into a car accident before getting to work - people would quickly know in-situ, in the office, but not so much remotely. \nAnother experience I had was a colleague in engineering who stayed home because of a sick kid (happened pretty often). This was in a German (male dominated) office environment, and she had a culturally French influenced background (where you would have been entitled to \"sick-kids-days\" contractually). Not so much in Germany. Nobody said anything at the time, especially as she was back in the room and offered her excuse with a straight face - but the consequences of such things can be pretty harsh, even in an in-situ situation. \nThat is why I think a \"remote professionalism\" HAS to look very different from the conventional one.\nIn conventional (EU/Western) professionalism you are to exclude the personal dimension, the emotional dimension, and to dress in a highly uniform(ed) way (not more than 5 pieces of \"juwelery\", black this, black that, grey ok, but no tan suits). That has many advantages, particularly if you need to \"focus on the matter at hand\", and all these other things are mainly detractions. \nAlso it allows better to force a hierarchy which may not be as easy to maintain in a more context rich environment - this is of course a factor that cuts both ways!\n\nNow in remote work we typically see so much less of each other (smaller steradian, less time, less definition & nuance, time zone and alertness, almost no context from circumstance i.e. where you are).\nSo if we reinforced this effect even more by trying to \"act professionally\" in a conventional way - we shoot ourselves in the second foot.\n\nNow some concrete proposals and high level analysis. Please challenge me on this as they may sound to confident and lack nuance because of word economy:\n\nInvest in decent gear!\nA good - very good **used microphone**, ideally several for different jobs:\n- Clip-on for noisy environment (the one on headphones can also work close to mouth)\n- Very sensitive condenser microphone (like a snowball) if you work in a quiet place.\n- Consider getting one with an omni-directional pick up pattern if you: might dial in with a group of 5-6 people, or want to peel potatoes in the kitch while in long meetings, but be able to reply fast.\n\nConsider bluetooth headset mics if you're on a budget. \nI've tried a couple of bluetooth speakers with built in mics. The mics are usually crap, but the speaker can be well worth it if you do hybrid meetings where you have a couple of cash-strapped enthusiasts on the other end of the world, while you do the dog and pony show in the c-suite.\nTest things well before you even step a foot into top level meetings. Have a backup for the backup and know how many seconds it takes to fire up. (Also know how to mute/kick a saboteur, if only for the confidence it gives you)\n\nRegarding cameras: \nIf you're like me and use old mobiles, it can make sense to get the \"almost latest\" logitech or similar. Note the view angle, and if the mics are sensitive & adjustable.\nBut also consider getting a wired internet adapter then, as you'll start pumping out a lot of data. If you don't have one, get a external usb port that has it built in - you can even hook many of them up to phones. Wifi is shitty in sooo many places, be cyberpunk and bring a cord.\n\nThe simpler solution is often to go with a decent smartphone + powerbank (ER should have a couple as give-aways to power-people) + bluetooth speaker (if the remotes should get their word heard) and a proper tripod. \n\nAlso a general note on audio based productivity: bluetooth eapieces (true wireless lalala) are effing magic when they work, especially if you're parenting and \"think time\" is very rare, but can usually be had when in the park, or in \"the wild\", or on the bus from the wild. ALWAYS bring them, and something to write/draw (never just 1 pencil!) comments and timestamps.\n\n**In my opinion every (non-sensitive) meeting above 4 people should be recorded, at least on audio.** \nIf you can: record to mp3, upload it before the last meeting is over, and have people download it before they get on their return trip (qr-codes?). If you ant to be a hero, supply the times to the major discussion points (3-4 will usually be fine) - you'll cut search time down drastically.\n\nAbove 4 people chances are high 1 didn't make it to the meeting so they'll need it anyway, chances are astronomical you didn't understand everything if 2 attendants don't have the same background.\nAlso, you can \"speak in search terms\" if you're recording. You can dive into extreme detail very briefly.\n\nIf what you were discussing was relevant and makes it past the 4-5 people (let's hope it does because otherwise why have a big meeting?) you'll need to onboard others - and exact timestamps in a context rich recording are invaluable for that.\n\nAnd if YOU relisten, you'll be amazed at how much you catch that you didn't get at first, how many more (mad) ideas you'll have when your brain is not running 80%-90% in social mode, and how easily you can improve on your own delivery skills.\nI work across timezones, and when shit gets urgent you can easily be there at 2 in the morning. Somewhere between then and when the sun comes up again one should consider informing your colleagues that while you're happy to hang in there, your alertness as a biological organism is by now evidently shot to pieces (and amphetamines usually aren't tax deductable as work requirement).\n\nAnother thing I'd like to see in general is what I call **the \"mumble channel\". The main point is to reduce selection bias**, or allow for hunches with regard to outliers.\nThis is where you could e.g. get anonymous comments, particularly from members who \"are not wired for meetings\". Sensitive, precarious outsider, introvert, busy doing shit, can't speak (the language), you name it. It could also be a separate chat (+ voting) that is projected into the meeting in the background.\nOnline meeting software has a long way to go to support all this, but some things can be cobbled together to 80% already.\nAnd again when you take asynch and hybrid meetings into account there's a lot you can do - for example give a simple mini-recorder to e.g. a quiet domain expert who can \"mumble\" a running commentary on the main conversation, which can be evaluated separately at a later time.\n\nThis is the more more \"technical half\", and I'll try to write the more \"communication / organization half\" in a little bit. \n\nAgain, please do challenge me on the wisdom behind these points, or add to them!

It directs the traffic of humanity through the creation of cultural, social, and material space. But do we feel empowered to direct? To design?\n> \n> Most moments of our existence are touched by design. We all sketch, we fashion trial balloons, we tinker with thoughts and concepts, we revise, we prototype, we analyze and critique, and we build. And then build again.\n> \n> Design intersects with science and art. We design experiments for research, scientific visualizations, and genetic models. We design performances, texts, and communication. We design gardens, houses, and cities. We create small and large. We find beauty in experience and efficiency.\n> \n> Design often mimics the intricate and perfect connections of healthy biological systems that nurture life. Yet design can also create destruction and chaos, or limit our participation and humanity. How might we explore this fantastic and perilous labyrinth of connections and implications bound up with art, science, and design?\n> \n> **The open call is an invitation to explore the world of design and its intersection with art and science. We invite proposals that address a wide range of subjects and themes, including the following:**\n> \n> ## **POTENTIAL SUBTOPICS AND THEMES**\n> \n> * What would a world without design be like?  \n> * How might design influence our vision and creative process? Our desires? Our identities and the identities of the world?\n> * How could biodesign restructure, improve, and restore our lives, or damage and destroy them?\n> * What might we learn from the ways that artists structure their studios, and the ways that scientists lay out equipment and material in their labs?\n> * Could we design ways to have our consciousness and cognitive acts leave traces beyond the death of our body?\n> * How does design expertise interact with a participatory design process? How can we design spaces where experts and non-experts build together?\n> * Could we create a participatory process for designing the future?\n> * How might design conjure up a beautiful, eerie, exciting, or creepy anticipation of the future?\n> * How might we think about vernacular design?\n> * What is the past and future of the relationship between nature, biology, and design?\n> * How does design direct intentions?\n> * How can we deal with the fact that design is both magical and dangerous?\n> * How could design not suppress the chaotic, unexpected, improbable, and disruptive?\n> * How might we design spaces and communities for highly mobile geographically nomadic groups of people?\n> * How could we address the trauma of digital data and selves becoming commodified, transacted, and controlled and suppressed?\n> * Could design guide a desirable transformation of society toward an equitable sustainable state?\n> * How do the designs of our technologies reflect or challenge our biases?\n> \n> ## **SEND US YOUR PROPOSAL TO BE IN THIS EXHIBITION!** \n> \n> Experimentation, provocation and research are at the heart of SGD\u2019s values and programs. This exhibition will explore the practice and concept of design through the lens of artists, psychologists, storytellers, digital gamers, molecular biologists, performers, neuroscientists, designers, computer scientists, nurses, engineers, musicians, mathematicians, architects, and young people. The list of possibilities is endless.  \n> \n> Your proposal could be a new or existing artwork, performance, workshop, digital intervention, research project, virtual reality game, or other activity.

But I did indeed break it down to a much smaller pilot version that is hopefully more sticky on the ground. Once there is a persistent structure etc. it is 0 problem to drop a bunch of epubs, daisy, and pdf on the side of the sd card (we currently have mostly 128 MB). Actually with the players costing around 1-2.5 EUR that is really the cheapest way to get a sd-card reader, an interface (earphones) and a charging cable / infrastructure into use. Anything that builds on this is of course a synergy win (and realistically already happening as I posted some old hardware down there). But a lot of the target audience is not literate, or has time to sit in front of a screen.\nAnd the other bit is that written material can always be read into audio - which could be either a paid job opportunity, or done as synth. My new pocketbook for example reads anything and dumps if where I want via bluetooth audio - probably just a 80/20 solution though.\n\nWith regard to open source / copyright I've taken an approach that is... let's say unbureaucratic. Where I can and feel it is right I try to reach out and inform the authors what we're doing. My expectation is that we will at some point run into problems - but I'd like to make sure they are with the right people / organizations. Because there is a scenario where you turn this risk into a opportunity. :wink: \nOr would you like to be a multinational trying to squeeze out money from the poorest of the poor and literally standing side by side with the likes of Boko Haram?

In order to select only 5 topics, we have looked at the overlap between the 8 NGI goals and the group discussion that came up during the workshop. This year, we had 6 different groups, and the prompt for discussion was to choose an example from the last two years in which human-centered values or democratic principles had been affected. Like this, the discussion was directed but not constrained according to previous results.\n\n**From the workshop D1.9**\n\n8 selected key topics:\n\n\u25cf Trustworthy Information Flows\n\n\u25cf Decentralised Power on the Internet\n\n\u25cf Personal Data Control\n\n\u25cf Sustainable and Climate-friendly Internet\n\n\u25cf Safer Online Environments\n\n\u25cf An Inclusive Internet\n\n\u25cf Competitive European Ecosystems\n\n\u25cf Ethical Internet Technology\n\n\n**1. Ethical Internet Technology**\n\nLast year, one of the 8 NGI goals arising from the analysis and the workshop was concerned ethical internet technology. This is quite a broad topic that came up again during this year\u2019s workshop, reflected in different subtopics chosen by the different discussion groups (3 out of 6 groups). In particular, groups highlighted areas such as video surveillance, implementation of internet technology, and discrimination resulting from algorithmic decision-making as areas of high priority for the next years. Overall, we can take the motto \u2018moving fast and breaking things\u2019 as a reflection of the attitude that needs to be seriously reconsidered. Some of the policies and regulations that were proposed around these areas include correcting the data collection imbalance, increasing the diversity at the higher level of policy making, and including mandatory ethics education in technical studies (i.e., computer scientists, engineers, etc). In addition to focusing on diversity to decrease discrimination bias, special emphasis was placed on the importance of testing decision-making algorithms and setting up requirements for public debates and transparency before implementation.\n\n*Challenges discussed in the second workshop within this topic:* Video surveillance (for decision-making), Implementing technology without proper discussions and transparency, Descriminating Algorithmic decision-making\n\n*Methods:* output of workshop D1.14 and workshop D1.9. At workshop D1.14, we split the participants into 6 groups, where each could choose a topic for discussion. 3 of the 6 groups had a topic in this category. The topic was one of 8 selected topics of the workshop D1.9.\n\n*We think it is important, because:* ethics is the fundament for identifying European values and solving social issues, which is one of the main objectives of the project (objective 2 in the grant agreement part B).\n\n**2. An Inclusive Internet**\n\nLast year, limited access to the internet was highlighted as one of the problematic areas, referring to half of the population still being offline, and urban areas being better connected than rural. Many disabled people also are excluded from using online information and services, so inclusive infrastructures and tools are needed to remove barriers and create an inclusive and accessible Internet for all. This year we saw this topic resurface in several of the discussions (2 out of 6 groups), in particular referring to the many internet shutdowns carried out by governments to suppress protests or movements in 2020. According to Human Rights Watch, this has occurred in Bangladesh, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan Myanmar and Zimbabwe. Possible solutions suggested during the expert workshop included the development of international legislation and centralising the point of control to the international neutral level.\n\n*Challenges discussed in the second workshop within this topic:* Unstable and no access to the internet, Shut down of internet by governments to suppress protests or movements.\n\n*Methods:* output of workshop D1.14 and workshop D1.9. At workshop D1.14, we split the participants into 6 groups, where each could choose a topic for discussion. 2 of the 6 groups had a topic in this category and the topic came up in a third group as well. The topic was one of 8 selected topics of the workshop D1.9.\n\n*We think it is important, because:* inclusivity is one of the European values mentioned in the grant agreement (Annex 1, p. 4).\n\n**3. Trustworthy Information Flows (Democracy, fake news and the internet)**\n\nIt is widely recognised that trustworthy information flows are essential for healthy democracies, and this year\u2019s covid crisis and the associated infodemic has given us a new perspective of the importance of reliable information. While the spread of disinformation did not arise as one of the preferred topics for discussion among the 6 groups, we asked explicitly about the best strategy to combat misinformation in a quiz to be completed at the individual level. There, the majority of responders chose the option referred to gaining a better understanding of why people share fake news (34.8%), followed by counteracting with accurate information (17.4%) and developing better fake news detection algorithms (8.7%). This further relates to other democracy threats mentioned above, governmental censorship and large-scale content moderation by online platforms.\n\n*Challenges discussed in the second workshop within this topic:* Shut down of internet by governments to suppress protests or movements\n\n*Methods:* output of workshop D1.14 and workshop D1.9. At workshop D1.14, we split the participants into 6 groups, where each could choose a topic for discussion. 1 of the 6 groups had a topic in this category. The topic was one of 8 selected topics of the workshop D1.9.\n\n*We think it is important, because:* trustworthiness is one of the European values mentioned in the grant agreement (Annex 1, p. 4).\n\n**4. Decentralised Power on the Internet and personal data control**\n\nThe internet of today is controlled by a handful of giant companies with virtual monopoly control, acting as gatekeepers by enforcing policies on their users. This is one of the 8 NGI topics from last year which resurfaced in this year\u2019s workshop around recent data leaks. In particular, a leak of governmental health data in Finland, where data had been used to blackmail citizens, was used as an example to illustrate this issue. This ties in with personal data control, and solutions proposed evolved around ideas of more efficient data de-anonymisation, the establishment of a human rights to slow down personal data collection, and more accountability at different levels.\n\n*Challenges discussed in the second workshop within this topic:* Risk of data leaks.\n\n*Methods:* output of workshop D1.14 and workshop D1.9. At workshop D1.14, we split the participants into 6 groups, where each could choose a topic for discussion. 1 of the 6 groups had a topic in this category. The topic was one of 8 selected topics of the workshop D1.9.\n\n*We think it is important, because:* decentralisation and promoting privacy are two of the European values mentioned in the grant agreement (Annex 1, p. 4).\n\n**5. Safer Online Environments**\n\nCyberviolence and hate speech was also chosen this year as vital in order to build a safer and more human-centric online environment. For this to happen, a range of issues needs to be taken into consideration, including the role of social media providers and the protection of free expression. At the same time, solutions need to be investigated, such as effective moderation or containment procedures, creating useful aid for victims of cyberviolence and enabling law enforcement to take action against offenders.\n\n*Challenges discussed in the second workshop within this topic:* How to protect minorities from discrimination and hate speech, and how to provide equal access\n\n*Methods:* output of workshop D1.14 (?) and workshop D1.9. At workshop D1.14, we split the participants into 6 groups, where each could choose a topic for discussion. 1 of the 6 groups had a topic in this category. The topic was one of 8 selected topics of the workshop D1.9.\n\n*We think it is important, because:* openness is one of the European values mentioned in the grant agreement (Annex 1, p. 4).", "created_at": "2020-11-12 06:56:53.757289", "updated_at": "2020-11-12 06:56:53.757289", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1335, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 7.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [86517], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 75428, "user_id": 4640, "topic_id": 12512, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Hi, Nadia-\n\nI would be glad to be part of the telephone call.

I hoped to get that by starting from an empirical problem, that of European populism, and moving on from there. I came out of our two days with two promising candidates: Wirtz's approach to finding out when informants are \"sure about what they are saying\", and Beckert's idea of \"thinking the present as dependent from the future, rather from the past\".\n\n### 1. Wirtz's interview entropy\n\nWirtz's paper (@sander, did he consent to us sharing it? Otherwise I cannot link it here) has a promising idea: reusing the coding of interviews (or posts in our case) for some algorithmic analysis. Its purpose, in the way that Sander presented it, is to determine which statements are delivered with confidence as opposed to only tentatively. I like this idea, and I have myself been thinking about \"reliability scores\" that would be attributed to _associations_ (i.e. edges in the semantic network), rather than statements. To compute them, I was thinking of using social networks metrics. \n\nHis main tool is to confront two measures of [Shannon entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)). One is the observed value, which has to do with the frequency with which each specific combination of codes occurs. The other one is the expected value, which is the frequency with which the same combinations _would_ occur, if the codes were independently distributed. \n\nHowever, after going through the paper itself, my enthusiasm has cooled considerably. Here is why, in decreasing order of importance: \n\n1. **Wirtz does not actually claim, outside of the paper's title, that he has constructed a \"coherence detector\"**. Instead, he makes considerably weaker claims:\n   > The frequency of a class in a given set of consecutive statements is the number of occurrences of that class in the set. We superimpose the [...] graph of this frequency on the three previous curves (observed information, expected information, and expected minus observed information). By looking at this graph we can see whether there is some degree of resemblance between the frequency time series and those of the three information statistics over part or all the interview. *If there is such a correspondence for some classes, we will claim that this class carries the information during this part of the interview*. [emphasis Wirtz's]\n   \n   In the final part of the paper, the author discusses his six interviews one by one, and even there he makes only cautious claims. _\"If we assume that the observed information betrays a temporary difficult with expression, we deduce that the present seems to pose the greatest difficulty for this man\"_. With a working mathematical coherence detector, we should not need to assume. \n\n1. **I am not convinced by the author's introduction of a time dimension in the interview**. His approach is to first \"slice\" each interview into statements (sentences, I presume). Next, he takes a \"sliding window\" of ten statements and assigns them a time code. Time 1 corresponds to statements 1 to 10, time 2 to statements 2 to 11, and so on. At this point, he computes information (via entropy) of the class that seems most meaningful *for each window*, so that both expected and observed information vary across the interview. This is not how @amelia describes coding: she treats each post as a whole, reading first the whole thing and only later starting to code statement by statement. As so often in data analysis in social sciences, Wirtz's methodological move (just like our own) hides a non-neutral assumption about the social conditions on the ground. He assumes that interviewees are \"winging it\"; we, instead, take people at face value, assuming what they are actually saying is what they meant to say, and don't try to second-guess them. Our assumption is maybe more realistic in texts that were delivered in writing, with the possibility to edit etc.; his is more realistic in texts that were delivered orally. Our assumption is also more in line with our ethical code of treating people on the platform as thinking adults, admittedly a leap of faith.\n\n1. **The method's scalability is not demonstrated, nor exemplified**. Wirtz goes through each of his six (six! We are already looking at 1,000 posts in POPREBEL) interview in painstaking detail. He does get some patterns, but his method is not more efficient than having a live ethnographer code for non-semantic codes like \"assertiveness\" and \"hesitation\", and much less precise.\n\n1. **I am not clear how expected information in a class is computed**. There is no formula; if I wanted to write some computer code implement the method, I would have to ask the author or invoking the help of someone like @melancon to help me interpret the paper.\n\nOverall, this method is cool but it does not seem worth the investment to me. Happy to reconsider if you disagree with me.\n\n### 2. Beckert's imagined futures\n\nI read the first (theoretical) part of Beckert's [book](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674088825). It argues that \n\n1. People need some idea of future states on the world in order to make decisions in the present.\n1. However, we have no way to \"compute\" such states with any degree of certainty. [Rational expectations theory](https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/RationalExpectations.html) is rejected, which is not hard at all. Instead, Beckert proposes the concept of *fictional expectations*: expectations are formed as causally credible stories about how the future follows from the present. \n1. Once adopted, fictional expectations inform present behavior. Therefore, who controls the narrative about the future controls the present, as speculators and central bankers know well. \n\nThis is great. But I do not see how it can contribute to expanding SSNA. It can play a role in POPREBEL, if we decide to pay attention to how informants see the future (a Europe of nations? A liberal globalist conspiracy ruling the continent? and so on). It can even help us make predictions, because fictional expectations held today will influence individual behavior (and therefore social phenomena) in the near future. Maybe we could discuss this issue with the U Tartu folks.

I also build electromagnetic sculptures, collaborate with physicists to teleport art pieces in virtual galleries or do inclusive design research to lower entry barriers for information, services and educational applications.\n\nI love to participate in and facilitate interdisciplinary communication and exchanges. Therefore I am excited about the type of community-driven research here at Edgeryders.\n\nI have an inherent urge to find points of connections between topics and people thinking about those topics, which I call being a &ldquo;compulsive connector&rdquo;. I love to recommend books and texts as well as potential collaboration or conversation partners. If you want to discuss an idea or help to formulate headlines, concepts or questions to connect to other people to make your project grow I am very happy to help.\n\nAfter my A-levels I started studying physics in Heidelberg, with the naive goal to understand everything, to than decide to change to fine art in Dresden to have more time to appreciate the beautiful models and think about their implications, from where, after participation in the FAST programme (Framing Art Science and Technology) I went to the RCA in London to do a Master in &ldquo;Information Experience Design&rdquo; to focus more on the design and development of &ldquo;Entry Points&rdquo; and &ldquo;points of Connection&rdquo; for others combining the approaches and tools of fine art, design, new technologies and scientific models.\n\nI conceptualised, realised and exhibited multiple interactive sculptures and installations across Europe and worked as a UX design researcher for example with the Helen Hamlyn Centre for design or for the financial education startup &ldquo;Gimi&rdquo;. In 2018 I relocated to Stockholm and am now an artist in residence at the comunity and culture hub &ldquo;Blivande&rdquo;.\n\nIf you are interested you can find some of my artistic works on my website [mariaeuler.com](http://mariaeuler.com/).\n\nSince 2010 I have lived in 6 different cities and 3 different countries in Europe and I very much appreciate being able to do that and the experiences and encounters I had and have while still being able to keep contact to my friends from school and later university across borders. However, sometimes I am questioning the effect of being disconnected from long term political and cultural discussions and participation due to this &ldquo;modern nomad&rdquo; lifestyle shared by so many of our generation, which is another reason I hope we can help to develop this more human-centric internet here at the Human Internet project.

Not sure if what we do is properly game development. It feels more like we use those tools to develop a world within which to place our stories and to define our characters within the roles required by narrative structure.\n\nIt seems a big part of game development involves the game engine or game mechanics, the rules of the game. We use either the Savage Worlds rules or the 2 Hour Wargames rules for this, depending upon the scenario we wish to play out.\n\nThere is a sub-genre of RPG referred to as \"narrative role playing\" where part of the game is developing a story collaboratively between the GM & players rather than just rolling the dice for combat & movement. We are most interested in this aspect. It seems that some people turn this into speculative fiction, back-story or fluff, to expand on the nature of the worlds the games takes place in. Games Workshop in particular publishes many novels of stories that take place in their gaming worlds. Also, sometimes characters created in the novels end up becoming models with game statistics making them playable in games. *Inquisitor* and *Rogue Trader* specifically work this way.\n\nHowever, these game worlds lack intimate detail, such as specific dialog clues between characters and even the psychological profiles that would put a player \"in character\". This is one place where we do a lot of development. We use Jungian archetypes with Freudian psychologies as extended by Melanie Klein and W.R. Bion.\n\nAlso, the games themselves tend to be confined within narrow conceptual terrains, no doubt to make the rules easier to implement. The settings are fabulous in a superficial way, something resembling the eye-candy in recent Hollywood \"cyberpunk aesthetic\" productions like the Scarlett Johansson *Ghost in the Shell* & the latest *Blade Runner*. In this sense, they seem to us to lack a certain dimensionality, they don't feel like complete worlds and more like a Disney Land set with stock animatronic robots and the story literally on railroad tracks. This is another place where we do a lot of development to make it more realistic by opening up possibilities for surprises.\n\nAnd, we seek to develop a true narrative structure. In the past we experimented with non-linear and experimental structures and audiences found them confusing while totally missing the point. After more research, we came around to the same structure used by Hollywood to create blockbusters with true global appeal. Wondering why this singular structure appeared so successful, further research revealed deep psychological reasons why this was so and convinced us to use this structure. No RPG we've been able to find develops such a satisfying narrative. So, we do a lot of development around the narrative structure. We make the distinction that we do not work within a \"formula\" but rather drape the meat of our narrative on the skeleton of a universally recognizable structure.\n\nOne more thing, we do a lot of development on the scenario, the set up, the main through-line of the story. We ask, \"What's at stake?\" & \"What must the lead character overcome personally?\" & \"What drives the characters?\" so that they seem forced to take certain actions and say certain things due to these parameters.\n\nMuch of this is readily accessible in the mundane everyday contemporary world but we wish to occupy the future. And a future as an extension of contemporary BAU does not exist, in our opinion. So merely taking everyday people and transporting them into the future does not seem possible. The future can't hold them or sustain their dysfunctional personalities. We wish to write about transformed people living in a world of loss. To do this, we've found using RPG & TT gaming tools useful.\n\nWe recognize that this would then lend itself to developing scenarios for RPG & TT game play as well as LARP environments but have yet to explore that. Savage Worlds seems more available to this type of expansion than Games Workshop. We're open to exploring that direction. To date we've only developed an original feature length screenplay that we wish to rewrite.\n\nTo look at this from a larger perspective, we feel that the world needs new stories & not just cold data presented in graphs & charts by a scientist. Not enough people appear convinced of the state of the world or what is needed to have a future. The path we've chosen is narrative story telling evolved in a collaborative setting extending beyond ourselves. \n\nPeople proved they can change what they are. Internalized narratives helped change what people are.

Currently I'm alone doing bookkeeping and relatively overloaded (over 3 years of non-management of Ecobytes, a lot of mess to clean up), which is why this is not yet as transparent and fluid as it should. I would be happy to share this work with at least one more person, ideally even a team, that could look for the finances of Ecobytes. Currently, I can grossly say that monthly infrastructure costs (~250 \u20ac, trend down) are over what we get in from memberships (~150 \u20ac, trend up).

Personally, we can say that we have personally benefitted greatly from this and noticed it takes a great deal of mutual trust and openness on the part of all involved, as it can get pretty intense, emotionally speaking.\n\nIt seems to us, both experientially & academically, that every human being is impinged upon by individuated PTSD. This appears confirmed by Freud, Melanie Klein, W.R. Bion and others. In our opinion and that of a few others it is responsible for what is identified as the innate/intrinsic paranoid-schizoid defenses and psycho-pathological development of alters. We can go on at length on this and perhaps exceed the scope of your question.\n\nIn a nutshell, PTSD as we described above enables war, religion and the current climate disaster.

Thank you to have conceived the Lab and engaged to make it happen.\n\nThis note is about the event. I know that this is only part of the Lab, but it was the one that I could follow the most. Some brilliant insights came from the event, but I think we should avoid the shallow mentioning of concepts that the Lab should help to scrutinize in-depth, instead. \n\nExample. In a Sci-Fi Economics Lab event, I would expect that the concept of \u201ccommons\u201d \u2013 dropped in the talk as an easy, non-problematic, issue \u2013 is critically examined through the perspectives offered by SF and fantastic fiction, economy, ecology, etc.\n\nMaybe defining and circumscribing the concepts to be discussed is an idea worth to be considered in future events. Some mainstream and already explored examples (non-proposals): what Houyhnhnms society in \u201cGulliver\u2019s Travels\u201d and the Morlocks-Eloi scenario in H.G. Wells\u2019 \u201cThe Time Machine\u201d can tell us about \u201cInequality\u201d?\n\nThe impressive work done in the Edgeryders\u2019 wiki on the selection of books and authors gives a lot of potential starting points, worth to be brought under the spotlight of the main event. \n\nI expect to hear from economists that believe in imagination as a tool for improving research in disciplines dominated by the \u201cno-alternative\" narratives, and \u201cnon-economists\u201d who acknowledge the unavoidable questions of economics. In my view, at the event, the latter perspective was mostly neglected.\n\nI see the Lab as a tool to making the economy, science, fiction and ecology consolidated frames collide and contaminate in new ways.

The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has changed our immediate daily lives but it will likely have lasting effects, too.\n\nAn interesting story in The Atlantic [this](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/06/pandemics-plagues-history/610558/) week explores how pandemics have previously impacted society and economies. It talks about how the Black Death that swept across Europe between 1347 and 1350 resulted in a huge loss of lives - particularly among children.\n\nThis inevitably led to a shortage of labour and farmers in Northern Italy began to increase their wages to attract workers. A middle class began to develop and the region became more affluent.\n\nLike previous pandemics, Covid-19 will change our societies and economies. While we won\u2019t see some of these changes until further down the line, others are more apparent.\n\nPerhaps one of the more obvious is the move to remote working. While many companies and employees were beginning to adapt to this model in recent years, they still made up a small proportion of the entire workforce.\n\nWith the pandemic, employees based in offices have been forced to work from home, and those who were more cautious to this style have seen its merits. The crisis has propelled a definitive move to remote working for many; even major tech companies that were previously \u2018office-centric\u2019 are now fully committed to the model.\n\nEdgeRyders has operated as a remote workplace since launching eight years ago. We have an entire section of our website dedicated to distributed collaboration [here](https://edgeryders.eu/c/ioh/coworking-distributed-collaboration) and have put together a book on how to establish a remote business or organisation, which you can find out more about [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/the-journey-to-the-distributed-business-future/13243).\n\nWith more people working from home and logging onto the internet to access their work network, it is likely that issues surrounding internet governance are more pressing than ever. \n\nWe have been discussing what the future of the internet looks like and one of our members wrote an interesting suggestion on [this thread,](https://edgeryders.eu/t/the-future-of-internet-governance/13818/4) saying that CMU researchers have suggested IoT gadgets should have privacy labels (that look pretty similar to an energy label that would comes with an electrical product a consumer may buy.\n\nIt\u2019s not just work and our new behaviours surrounding the internet that will change because of the pandemic. The crisis has also shone a spotlight on inequalities - and in cases exacerbated those inequalities - in our societies. People are demanding change to these old unfair systems on which our societies have been built.\n\nThere have been conversations on EdgeRyders about how we can support the movement for racial justice in the US. This week, [some of our members](https://edgeryders.eu/t/support-the-movement-for-racial-justice-in-the-usa/13794/14) have added to that conversation and highlighted that Europeans are quick to condemn the States for its racist systems and behaviour but are less critical in analysing our own systems of inequality. Please join in the conversation\n\nFood for thought\n\nWe are organising a coworking summit that will be further delving into topics discussed in this newsletter on 21st July. While on 22nd June we have a[ pre-summit session](https://edgeryders.eu/t/session-on-endangered-researchers-and-precarity-in-higher-education/13414), where we will be talking to higher educational experts, policymakers, unionists, human rights defenders to discuss challenges facing those working in academia.\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nOne of our members is looking for a senior developer to take over as Chief Technology Officer at an edtech start-up.

Before going into details (calculating materials needed etc.), hopefully there are good rules of thumb based on building type, size, age and the intended type of conversion? Where do we find these numbers?\n\n\nAs an initiative, I reached out to local engineer who specializes in restoring and renovating older historic buildings. He got back to me in a few moments (!) but mentions it is a bit more nuanced, since it really is site specific. \n\n> Currently there is no industry wide rule of thumb for costs based purely upon building type, size and age.  There are a few different costing approaches for getting rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimates.  The type of conservation and the required intensity is going to be a factor. \n\n> Typically a starting point is a professional review of the site, and they will make a ROM estimate based partly upon the rules of thumb they reference and partly upon their own experience.  I have often heard references to the dollars per square foot based upon building condition and end goals \u2013 but they do vary between professionals.\n\n> Not sure that helps much, but this is an example of the challenge for conservation of old buildings.  There are just enough exceptions to every rule it can be dangerous making rules.  *The greater unknowns tend to be the factor that scare stakeholders from following best practices, because they worry about what can go wrong \u2013 taking solutions that cost more (both economically and ecologically).* \n\nThe last sentence (emphasis mine\u2026) here is a bit of an eye opener; since I suspect through experience that he has lived through this, where unlikely consequences drive the redesign to be bigger in scope than is actually needed; *it's not rightsized.*  Unfortunately, I've lived through this also, wayyyy too many times.

Once these infographics exist, he wants to make them interactive, so it's not just something static but rather something that you can navigate, browse, filter etc. It can give you context, images, more information about the project and the knowledge and experience you gained from it, which these days is what an employer tries to discover in the interview stage.</span> So the process can be much easier and faster from a recruiter point of view which is a big selling point</span>.</span>\n\nHow you can help:\n\n<span>-get involved in the discussion. Right here, right now. what thoughts do you have on this idea? are there any precedents or examples of others working in this field? do you have ideas or resources which you could contribute?\n\n-<span>if you believe in the cause and have relevant skills or just motivation and enthusiasm, by all means get in touch with Alessandro and join the team!</span></span>\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-26 11:14:51", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:15.659018", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 696, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 55.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2105], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6853, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 1215, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Tech hint</b>\n\nThe way to create a \"Create Task\" button is to link the button to <a href=\"/node/add/task/568?og_group_ref=568\">https://edgeryders.eu/node/add/task/568?og_group_ref=568</a>.\n\nFor adding tools and wikis the link would be <a href=\"/node/add/wiki?og_group_ref=568\">https://edgeryders.eu/node/add/wiki?og_group_ref=568</a>.

to share with you what I am doing. \n\nAfter graduating from the architectural department, and as a student I was very interested in environmental studies, I found out the building method adopted by the Egyptian market, which is mainly one methodology, is not the methodology I wanted to work with.\n\nI always had the idea that architects should find solutions for the problems facing their country/ community or living environment. At this time, 2013, there was a huge problem with garbage collection facing the country, it was very obvious everywhere especially when there was a strike or so done by the workers.( during 2013 there were a lot of strikes in Egypt ) \n\nAnd this was the problem that I wanted to participate in solving, and this was the beginning. \nI thought I might revitalize my rooftop with the minimum costs so that the methodology could be adapted for other people to repeat my experiment. \n\nThe First step was to separate the garbage. This was done on different stages as this was the first time to separate  garbage in my home and we don\u2019t know which garbage can give us easy products to work with and which is the most friendly way to separate for the residents of the house (my family ) In the end we settled on separating into 3 kinds:\n\n* The organic ( that comes not from animal or fish- so mainly fruits and vegetables ) \n* The refused waste ( the fish/meat waste, others that need energy or water to clean and be useable ) \n* The other \u201cclean\u201d waste that could be used as plastics and so \n\nAt the same time a program for \u201cwhat\u2019s need\u201d on the roof was done and the first step was to build a shade (pergola ) from the plastic bottles ( this was the  most suitable material from the waste to experiment with ) \n\nStarted by collecting a lot of plastic bottles from the house and the surrounding community( as we didn\u2019t have enough )  got them from a center for funerals where they have a lot of them. Then started to experiment to find a good way to build with them without using any adhesive materials. \nFor 9 months, from December till September 2014, experimenting and in the end decided to go with using wood for the columns with some nails, and using the bottles for the upper part by stacking them together  (after poking a small hole on the bottom to link them together. )\n\nSince September 2015 till now, It is still standing up there; just some dust entered the bottles as they were used empty ( the architectural reason was to provide shade without isolating people from the surrounding environment ) Also the lids got affected more than the bottles themselves as they are made from different types of plastic. \n\nDuring the same time, I was doing other experiments with the organic waste mentioned earlier to make compost to plant on the roof. Of course tried several trials ( still experimenting since 2014) \n\nAt first, I tried with worms and this failed drastically ( it was supposed to eat the waste and produce compost, as simple as that, but my trials ended up in failure ) After this, I settled on using a bucket technique, simply putting the waste in 2 buckets the outer one is with holes and then putting some sand on top. Then leave them to disintegrate alone. This takes some time but it is relatively easy and gives good results. ( just wait and see, first, there is dirty water, then water comes out with some worms, then clean water and here you go a perfect compost to use ) This takes around 2 to 3 months in summer and around 6 in winter. ( depends also on the no and area of the holes ) \n\nThen comes the stage of actually planting using this compost ( tried with Rucola ) \nI tried 4 patches, same size and quantity different type of soil, 3 failed and one worked. The one that lived was normal soil mixed with compost, I am still experimenting and learning more about agriculture. The main issue here is the weight, as am planting over a rooftop, it should be light. Normally in Egypt \u201cpeat moss\u201d is largely used in rooftop planting as it is light ( projects like the one in El-Darb El-Ahmar is based on peat moss but they are stopped now because the prices jumped from 80 pounds per pack to 300 - this was last year before the current inflation, not sure how much is now but certainly very expensive ) \n\nThe last trial was to produce more compost using a bigger bucket, so I reused an old wooden pallet to make a big rectangular container with one opened side. Sadly this didn\u2019t work efficiently because of the opened side was big, so now trying to make it with the smaller side opened.\n\nCurrently I am writing my master thesis (of a course which related to environmental issues and about what I am doing on the roof ) and trying to open a job market by founding a startup (Eiid) ,recycling for architecture, as we can work with people who are willing to make something like this on their rooftops using local material instead of buying new with their participation in design and hopefully implementation.", "created_at": "2017-08-19 18:10:44.606870", "updated_at": "2017-09-05 11:58:46.589807", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1773, "wiki": false, "reads": 23, "score": 419.6, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 3729, 3782, 3880, 3830], "is_private": false}, {"id": 64651, "user_id": 5696, "topic_id": 11635, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Pozdrav svima,\n\nrodjen u Beceju, tu sam i odrastao, ozenio se, dobio dvoje dece (kcerku i sina).Preduzetnik sam, uspesno sam razvio porodicni biznis. Imamo vise  vremena da provedemo zajedno kao familija. Polazak u preduzetnistvo je jako velika zivotna skola. Ja sam, kao i svi u pocetku, napravio mnoge greske. Greske se desavaju, svaki dan ucimo i to je za mene normalno...to je ciklus zivota i neizbezan proces.\n\nVeliki problem je odlazak mladih iz Srbije. Eto mnogi iz Beceja odlaze u Madjarsku, a ja znam da iz Madjarske mladi odlaze dalje na zapad takodje. Nazalost, niko mladima ne govori kako je stvarno tamo na zapadu i ne pricaju o problemima koje tamo srecu. Mnogi zive i u gorim uslovima nego u Srbiji ali ne zele o tome pricati. Mozda bi kad bi znali sta ih sve ceka napolju odlucili i ostati u kuci. Bio sam clan izvrsnog odbora udruzenja preduzetnika. Tako sam dosao u kontakt sa udruzenjima iz civilnog sektora (pre vise od deset godina). Tako sam se nasao u jednom drustvu (bilo je nas 8) koje je zelelo uciniti nesto dobro za svoj grad, sto je bila i moja zelja. Osnovali smo udruzenje i krenuli sa radom. Podrzavali smo jedan drugoga i radili kao ekipa, to nam je bilo jako vazno i omogucilo nam da guramo napred.Resili smo da predjemo na edukaciju i vrlo brzo smo dosli do pozitivnih rezultata, pocele su nas zvati skole sve vise i bili su zadovoljni. Od 8 osnivaca udruzenja ostala su samo 3, ostali su otisli u inostranstvo. Na zalost nisu imali energije vise i strpljenja da sacekaju da stvari krenu na bolje. U medjuvremenu smo naravno dobili mnoge nove clanove a ja sam postao neka vrsta voditelja udruzenja. Ekologija i iskoristenje obnovljivih materijala nije moja struka ali jeste strast i vazna tema za sve nas. Imamo samo jednu zemlju, ona nam daje sve tako da je odgovornost svih nas da se brinemo o njoj.Mi u Srbiji imamo zakone za zastitu okoline ali nazalost u Srbiji se ti zakoni ne postuju niti drzava gura. Cesto firme gledaju da ustede na tome i drzava im gleda kroz prste. Udruzujemo se sa drugim udruzenjima koja za misiju imaju ocuvanje prirode (zelena stolica, prisustvuju u skupstini u Srbiji ali bez ucestvovanja osim ako nije pitanje direktno vezano za ocuvanje okoline). Ministri cak imaju obavezu da nas saslusaju, ali niko nema obavezu da nesto i uradi po tom pitanju.\nAko mi guramo fabrike da ugrade filtere na primer, oni ce da daju otkaze ljudima da nadoknade troskove vezane za ugradjivanje filtera. Na kraju je regulacija na jako niskom nivou da se zadrze radna mesta.Takodje mi nemamo posebno ministarstvo za zastitu prirode. Taj deo je uvek prikljucen nekom drugom ministarstvu, oni se kao bave zastitom prirode ali u praksi se to ostavlja sa strane. Svi znaju da problem postoji ali niko ne nudi resenje.\n\nPostoje takodje razna resenja za vecu efikasnost, iskoristivost otpadnih materijala. Mogli bi da iskoristavamo bio otpad za stvaranje komposta i to prodajemo. U okolini ne postoji takvo postrojenje. Mi u Vojvodini nemamo adekvatan vetro zastitni sloj zemlje, tako da tu plodnu zemlju vetar raznosi drugde. Mogli bi da sadimo drvece da to sprecimo ali to se ne radi.\n\n Zelim da na radionici bude isto prakticnih primera sto se sve moze napraviti. S obzirom da je jedna od tema kreativnost, mi mozemo da vam pokazemo sta je sve moguce napraviti od materijala koje drugi ljudi bacaju. Nemam specificna ocekivanja, ako mogu da pomognem i doprinesem na neki nacin ja cu to rado uciniti. Videcu kako ce se stvari odvijati u Beceju pa cemo da vidimo kako cemo dalje. Ja imam par predloga ali to cemo ostaviti za posle![ekoBecej%202|690x517](upload://gT9yi7lZbC6wkii3gag3zJaRO1S.jpeg) ![ekoBecej%201|690x517](upload://hG8mgiHHH0SMABupTJXPWRObiNo.jpeg) ![ekoBecej%203|517x690](upload://5LBrx1IKlvoiUJZdNhXqGRCQgzi.jpeg)", "created_at": "2019-11-19 11:11:44.999000", "updated_at": "2019-11-19 11:15:09.594515", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 635, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 97.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5347, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14948, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 624, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>The eyecontact experiment</b>\n\nA very basic event which happened in a lot of cities over the last years, including\u00a0where I live (Cluj) was to have hundreds of people - strangers - staring in each others eyes for one long minute, two by two.

Himalayan Cataract Project is a brain child of Dr. Sanduk Ruit, a Nepalese eye surgeon, who invented a cheap and simple method to operate cataract and restore vision. The organization was later on started by Dr. Tabin, American eye specialist who fell in love with the project while on holidays in Himalaya. The duo is now leading the world\u2019s biggest project aiming at removing cataract for the poorest:\u00a0through\u00a0a ten minute microsurgery with\u00a0articial lens\u00a0implantation.\n\nThe project is extraordinary and has been documented in media all over the world. My favorite aspects of it are:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\tThe lenses used by the doctor are produced in Tilganga in Kathmandu, Nepal, bringing their costs down from 100 dollars to around 3.5 per piece.</li>\n\n<li>\tThe surgery lasts around five minutes per eye, and can be delivered almost anywhere. I saw a documentary about Dr Ruit and his visits in the Himalayan villages, where he opened pop-up clinics and treated dozens of people a day; for most of these people ability to see is crucial not only to their own well-being, but also the condition of the family, which needs their working hands;</li>\n\n<li>\tHis lenses have 98% success rate, same as sophisticated and expensive surgeries delivered in USA (using equipment for 1 million dollars)</li>\n\n<li>\tThe doctor himself has cured around 120.000 people</li>\n\n<li>\tBy funding Tilganga Institute of Ophthalmology, Dr. Ruit created a whole system that provides patients with complete eye care - and the fees that better-off patients pay for their services finance the free surgeries for the others;</li>\n\n<li>\tIn Tilganga they also manufacture eye prosthetic which has similar quality with those produced in the West, but costs 3 dollars, instead of 150.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThis simple idea turned out incredibly effective and is tested now in other countries.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.cureblindness.org/eye-on-the-world/press\">http://www.cureblindness.org/eye-on-the-world/press</a>\n\nhttp://www.tilganga.org/\n\n", "created_at": "2016-07-24 17:00:47", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 07:57:01.287662", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 414, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 15.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 83780, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 14462, "post_number": 2, "raw": "As I write this, I am in quarantine waiting on the results of my COVID swab. A housemate of mine tested positive two days ago (no symptoms, though), and we all had to get tested as a result.\n\n![image|690x388](upload://7GqMMhhd8ctd0mf4ZE8Q15lb6s8.jpeg) \n\nHere's how it went. On Wednesday at 16.30 she received a call from the Track and Trace call center; immediately alerted us and went into isolation. We all quarantined ourselves on the spot. We then called the call center on Thursday morning, and they immediately generated codes that function as doctor's prescriptions. With them, we could go to a test center (no appointment needed), and by 13.00 our swabs were done. By the end of the afternoon, we had  established supply lines: several friends volunteered to do our groceries, the Arab shop next door agreed to deliver anything we order via Whatsapp. Additionally, we re-organized the house: we reserved some spaces (including a toilet) to the person who tested positive, made some new DIY hand sanitizer etc. \n\nAll this felt surprisingly peaceful and reassuring. I asked myself why, and \u2013 provisionally \u2013 I concluded that I like what is happening because it makes sense. This is the \"test, track and trace\" strategy that we were clamoring for in March, and suddenly here it is, and it works. The facilities are in place, and the community does not reject you as an infectious, dirty spreader, but is reasonably (and sometimes very) compassionate and supportive.\n\nAnd this brought home how *un*safe I have felt every time I saw obvious blunders in the whole COVID mess. \n\nPolicies with no scientific grounding make me feel insecure, because they reveal the agendas driving them. Exhibit A here is the Italian decision to forbid outdoors physical activity by people on their own. The Health Minister tried to object: doctors are always recommending people exercise more, especially the elderly, and forbidding them to walk seemed very bad for their physical and mental health (and it was). But the Interior Minister insisted: \"if people can go out, how can I check that they are not violating the lockdown rules?\". This stuff scares me, because it shows the kneejerk attraction for control in many parts of the modern state. So strong, in fact, to trump the wellbeing of citizens. To protect our health, they make us ill. \n\nA tragic symbol of this is a young Bruxellois called Adil: he and his friends were allegedly breaking the COVID imposition to gather in groups, so the police went to break up the gathering. [And then they chased him on his scooter, until he crashed onto a chasing police car and died.](https://www.rtbf.be/info/societe/detail_on-l-a-eu-on-l-a-percute-la-police-serait-peut-etre-a-l-origine-de-la-mort-d-adil-a-anderlecht?id=10485209) To protect him from COVID, they killed him. \n\nPoliticians minimizing without knowing what they are talking about (like the Belgian federal health minister De Block at the beginning of the crisis makes me feel insecure, because it feels like there are no responsible adults at the steering wheel at a delicate time. \n\nPaternalism and back covering (like the Italian prime minister Conte, continuously pushing the responsibility for fighting the pandemic onto the individual behavior of citizens) makes me feel insecure, because it creates \"toxic community\": neighbors turning onto neighbors, accusing innocent runners of \"endangering the community\" by \"not respecting the rules\". And I do not want to live in a toxic community.\n\n\nPosturing officials (the nationalist/populist leader De Wever, mayor of Antwerp, who imposed a curfew on the city, and that way promoted his image as a tough, determined leader) make me feel insecure, because posturing does nor solve problems, and it rewards strongmen that could potentially make my life more miserable. \n\nIgnorance and high-running emotions (see this funny-sad [viral video](https://youtu.be/KxtGJsnLgSc) of Italian mayors enforcing lockdown) make me feel unsafe, because the emotional stance is rhetorically powerful, and can kill any argument. \n\nThe [sudden spike in appetite for surveillance in the wake of COVID](/t/13183) makes me feel insecure. Again, the health argument is threadbare: some countries launched their respective magic COVID apps before having testing capacity. In this situation, all that the app does is surveillance, with very little effect on public health.\n\nThe horrible precarity in working conditions makes me feel insecure, because it has a huge impact on public health. People who are not paid to stay at home will risk working, try to hide their symptoms, and infect others \u2013 and this happened, [for example in Germany](/t/13960).\n\nI could go on, but you get the idea. The pandemic is a lens, that focuses trends in society. Some of these trends make me feel very insecure. They are the same I disliked before, but there is extra insecurity as I realize how weak the public sphere becomes when people are scared and exhausted.", "created_at": "2020-09-25 13:56:28.601965", "updated_at": "2020-09-25 15:05:48.350350", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 833, "wiki": false, "reads": 26, "score": 1180.2, "like_count": 9, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 5422, 5, 2915, 1877, 2330, 5647, 3206, 6400], "is_private": false}, {"id": 43225, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 8345, "post_number": 14, "raw": "Also, vegetarian food is cheaper.

Introduction <a name=\"chap-1\"></a>\n\nAs a late outcome of Edgeryders' OpenVillage [House prototype in Sidi Kaouki, Morocco](/t/id/7955), I [discovered](https://sustainability.stackexchange.com/a/6518) that there is no (!) readily available and economically meaningful, commercially made solution for self-consumption of the electricity from small (<1 kW<sub>peak</sub>) photovoltaic installations. For larger installations, there are string inverters with a zero-export feature, but they are expensive.\n\nInspired by this, I developed the idea below that solves both issues. Initially for the house in Sidi Kaouki, but I think there is a worldwide market for it in all development countries where utility companies forbid or do not reward exporting locally generated electricity to the grid. If they forbid it, the idea below is the only option. If they do not reward it, the idea below is the most economical option. (See [here](https://sustainability.stackexchange.com/q/6519) for the different ways how utility companies treat feed-in.) In total, the product might revolutionize access to energy and utilization of rooftop solar panels \u2013 because without needing a grid-tied inverter nor a battery bank, solar energy will be the cheapest option for many grid-connected households.\n\n\n## 2. Basic Idea and Advantages <a name=\"chap-2\"></a>\n\nA small-ish supercapacitor bank is recharged by photovoltaics panels and the house runs either on the grid, or from that supercap bank via a cheap, not grid-tied inverter. An automatic transfer switch switches between the two options seamlessly every few minutes, whenever the supercap bank is discharged.\n\nThis setup has a range of advantages over [all alternatives](https://sustainability.stackexchange.com/a/6518), including that of a battery system in off-grid or hybrid homes:\n\n* **Cheapest purchase price.** With respect to the purchase price, it would be by far the cheapest variant for small installations <2 kW<sub>peak</sub>, because it contains neither batteries nor a grid-tied inverter. These are the most expensive components in the alternative systems.\n\n    Grid-tie inverters are so expensive probably due to the extra safety features and certification costs of grid-connected generation equipment. Inverters in true off-grid homes are expensive because they also need to handle the peak power draw, while in our case we can use a smaller inverter and in case of overload quickly transfer-switch to the grid. Batteries are expensive because a large capacity is needed; in cases like here not to enable high loads (which are also possible with lower capacities, e.g. automotive starter batteries) but to enable high enough charging currents by the solar panels even when the batteries are 80-95% full (which is needed as deep cycling reduces their lifetime).\n\n* **Cheapest to maintain and repair.** With respect to maintenance costs, the system will also be much cheaper than current alternatives. It does not contain a battery, so does not incur regular major replacement costs; instead it uses supercapacitors, which do not degrade noticeably. Also the whole system consists of individual modules that can be exchanged individually, and each such module / part is a very standard off-the-shelf component available from multiple manufacturers. The biggest cost factor will be the not grid-tied inverter, and even that is <50 EUR for the smallest size.\n\n* **Easily made in many sizes.** Grid-tied inverters are not available in sizes less than 250 W, probably because the fixed costs of safety features and certification would make smaller sizes unreasonably expensive. The idea outlined below can be built economically in smaller sizes. (Even though smaller inverters than 300 W are hard to find and not that meaningful as even a 300 W inverter is [only 20 EUR](https://www.ebay.de/itm/173173348093)).\n\n* **Scales on-site.** People can start with a small system size and expand it later, as they have money. This is very suitable for low-income markets. Technically, this is possible because the system needs no charge controller. Simply add more photovoltaics panels, supercaps and (for installation sizes >2 kW<sub>peak</sub>) more inverters in parallel to the existing one. Transfer switches are sized for the inverter and added as inverters are added, so so not have to be exchanged. Only the solar panel disconnect relay should be oversized in the beginning, to match the possible peak load from future additions of solar panels. It should be made for 30 A, thus able to switch all panels that can connect to a single [MC4 connector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MC4_connector) (which are rated either 20 A or 30 A depending on manufacturer). If even more panels are added, simply a second disconnect relay will be added as well.\n\n* **No vendor lock-in.** It only uses readily available off-the-shelf components available from many manufacturers. This is way better than vendor lock-in for a highly specialized \"micro inverter with zero export\" or \"zero export device\", as these products might be discontinued, their manufacturer might go out of business or provide poor support in cases of issues or warranty.\n\n* **No permission needed.** It can be used even where all grid-tied inverters are forbidden by the utility company, including those with a zero-export function. Because this system only connects electrical consumers to the grid, and that is what the grid is for. (Usually, when everything is forbidden the reason given is the safety of line workers, even though that should be covered by the anti-islanding function of the grid-tie inverter.)\n\n* **DIY friendly.** No permission from the utility company is needed, all components are off-the-shelf products and the only work is connecting them and putting them into a case. This makes development and production very do-it-yourself, enabling anything from micro-enterprises producing these items to people building them for themselves in their villages.\n\n\n## 3. Details  <a name=\"chap-3\"></a>\n\nLoads are by default connected to an inverter that is fed by the supercaps bank, which is fed in turn by both the solar panels.\n\nA description of the main components of this system:\n\n* **Microcontroller.** An off-the shelf microcontroller (e.g. Arduino) or single board computer (e.g. Raspberry Pi) that controls all other components.\n\n* **Inverter.** An inverter that accepts 24 V DC input (usually meaning a 20-30 V DC range) and outputs 230 V AC. By not being certified for grid-tied operation, it is much cheaper. A model with pure sine wave output is recommended (ca. 150 EUR for a model with 1000 W continuous power output), but those cheaper ones with modified sine wave output can also be used (see chapter \"[Options, Variants, Improvements](#chap-5)\").\n\n* **Supercapacitors.** The accumulate solar energy until the loads are switched over to use it up again. They can endure about one million charge cycles, so frequent cycling is ok. This allows to make them quite small: the supercap bank can be for example 10 Wh of usable capacity, and that should be enough for a small house. At the max. load the inverter can handle (say 1000 W, somewhat above baseload) and negligible PV input, this would equate to a worst-case discharge time of (10 Wh * 3600 s/h) / 1000 W = 36 s. Since inverters usually only work within the limits of 10-15 V or 20-30 V input, we cannot use the full energy in the supercaps but only about half. Still, that would mean 20 Wh capacity, or about 200 EUR of costs.\n\n* **Transfer switch.** A standalone, programmable [automatic transfer switch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_switch) (ATS) with open transfer, which means it first disconnects the load from the inverter before connecting it to the grid, or vice versa. Since our system contains a microcontroller that can do the automation part, the ATS would be a simple changeover relay with open transfer, with its default (de-energized) position connecting the loads to the grid. (Instead of a changeover relay, combining two single relays and switching them with a short delay would also be possible, but a bad idea \u2013 it is not fail safe in case of a controller software bug that would connect both relays, causing unsynchronized and anyway forbidden backfeeding to the grid.) The switchover time of an ATS is so fast (10-100 ms) that consumers are not affected \u2013 even computers will not be switched off by the transfer.\n\n* **No solar charge controller needed!** The supercaps bank needs a balancer but is otherwise very simple to charge when not desiring MPPT to run the solar panels: it only needs to stop when the supercaps are full, to not damage them. Due to this, we do not need a charge controller but can use a simple relay, controlled by our microcontroller. Since we will cycle the supercaps within the voltage range of lead-acid batteries to match the input requirements of the inverter, the driving efficiency of the solar panels would be equivalent to what a PWM charge controller achieves \u2013 which is generally acceptable. And since there is no real charge controller, a major cost esp. of scaling is elimited, and there are no limits for oversizing the photovoltaics array either \u2013 in contrast to a charge controller, the supercaps will handle more or less any inrush current an array of PV panels can throw at them.\n\nA description of the control algorithm in the microcontroller:\n\n* While more solar electricity can be produced than needed by the house, the house is permanently connected to the supercaps bank via the inverter.\n\n* When less energy than needed can be produced, the house will discharge the supercaps bank. When reaching the lower limit of the acceptable voltage range (20 V), the microcontroller will switch all loads in the house over to the grid.\n\n* At that point, the supercaps will be charged again by the solar panels as there is zero consumption now. When they are full, the loads are switched over to the supercaps bank and the cycle starts anew. One full cycle should last at least 20 s under peak load, perhaps longer, depending on the expectable lifetime of the supercaps and on how much stress switchover puts on electrical equipment.\n\n* If the inverter becomes overloaded by its loads, the microcontroller switches it immediately over to the grid, to protect the inverter from damage.\n\n\n## 4. Cost Calculation  <a name=\"chap-4\"></a>\n\nRough estimate for a size with 500 W<sub>peak</sub> photovoltaics:\n\n* Photovoltaics panels, 500 W<sub>peak</sub>: 195 EUR (used from Germany, where they are available for 30-40% their original price in large quantities; no problem here as enough identical modules can be purchased for a small 500 W<sub>peak</sub> plant)\n* Changeover relay, 240 V, 16 A: 20 EUR\n* Relay for solar panel disconnect, 50 V, 30 A: 5 EUR\n* Microcontroller: 20 EUR\n* Relay control board, AC current sensor, DC current sensor, DC voltage sensor: 40 EUR\n* inverter, 20-30 V to 240 W, 1000 W pure sine wave: 140 EUR\n* supercaps, 20 Wh: 200 EUR\n* supercaps balancer: 20 EUR\n* cables, connectors, case etc.: 60 EUR\n* **sum:** 700 EUR (with industrial mass production maybe 450 EUR)\n\nRough estimate for a size with 50 W<sub>peak</sub> photovoltaics and a modified sine wave inverter, all in all the smallest reasonable variant for households with very low electricity needs:\n\n* Photovoltaics panels, 50 W<sub>peak</sub>: 50 EUR\n* Changeover relay, 240 V, 16 A: 20 EUR\n* Relay for solar panel disconnect, 50 V, 30 A: 5 EUR\n* Microcontroller: 20 EUR\n* Relay control board, AC current sensor, DC current sensor, DC voltage sensor: 40 EUR\n* inverter, 20-30 V to 240 W, 1000 W modified sine wave: 50 EUR\n* supercaps, 10 Wh: 100 EUR\n* supercaps balancer: 20 EUR\n* cables, connectors, case etc.: 50 EUR\n* **sum:** 355 EUR (with industrial mass production maybe 200 EUR)\n\n\n## 5. Options, Variants, Improvements  <a name=\"chap-5\"></a>\n\n* **Without supercaps but with charge controller.** This is probably a major improvement because it replaces the rare and expensive components (supercaps) with standard ones (a charge controller and a lead-acid battery or iron-nickel battery). The battery will not (!) by cycled, it is just used to provide a few seconds of power to the inverter when direct input from the sun via the charge controller is not sufficient. This can be a transient condition of high power draw (for example when a fridge starts) but when it lasts longer than a few seconds then the system would switch over to the grid because grid electricity is still cheaper than local battery electricity. \n\n    The charge controller can be small, as it can be dimensioned according to the base load of the house (typically 100-200 W, so a 24 V / 15 A MPPT charge controller is fully sufficient, and quite cheap). Likewise, the lead-acid battery can be small because it will not be cycled. An automotive battery is the cheapest option and fine for this, as it is meant to provide high currents in short peaks, without being deep-cycled. Even a used automotive battery (without much current carrying capacity left) can be utilized here for some time as the system can be configured to also switch over to the grid when the battery cannot supply enough current (means, when its output voltage buckles), even before the normal 3-7 seconds of running loads on battery have passed. In this use of being properly charged more or less all the time, a lead-acid battery can last for 10-20 years, and an iron-nickel battery lasts 30-50 years anyway. The only case when the battery would be cycled is when the grid is down and there is not enough sun to power the loads.\n\n* **Multiple transfer switches.** The proposal just above of using a lead-acid battery instead of supercaps and not cycling the battery has the disadvantage that locally produced electricity is not used at all when the total electrical consumption of the house exceeds current photovoltaic electricity generation. That can be fixed by having multiple transfer switches, one for each of the different circuits in the house, mounted inside the house's switchpanel. Then, circuits that together do not exceed the current power production will still be powered by solar, and only the remaining circuits are switched over to the grid. Since a house usually has 1-2 circuits per room, this easily allows to single out the large loads (vacuum cleaner, powertools etc.) and power them from the grid, while the base load of the house (fridge, freezer, lighting, electronics etc.) can still be powered by the solar panels during the day.\n\n* **Modified sine wave inverters.** For low-income markets, significant cost savings are possible by using a modified sine wave (\"square wave\") inverter instead of a pure sine wave version, which costs about three times as much. Some but few equipment items may be damaged over time by the high peak voltages (\"HF noise\") in square waves, and motors may make annoying sounds (details [here](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/q/13143) and [here](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/q/128365)). Both can be averted by simple and cheap filter circuits. Examples: [1](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/212604), [2](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/109470), [3](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/q/356696), [4](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/272442), [5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfYPWbBB1mE). These circuits have to be adapted to the power consumption of the individual consumers, so it makes sense to sell them as a range of plug adapters that will be kept connected to the devices. Anyway, a \"household standard\" that requires all devices to somehow accept square wave input is on the long run cheaper and more friendly for DIY-generated AC power.\n\n* **Microgrids.** It is posisble to connect the supercap banks of neighboring houses into a [SELV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra-low_voltage) microgrid, further reducing dependence on the grid by leveling out excess supply and demand of electricity in the neighborhood. 24 V DC cabling of sufficient diameter can be run over 50-100 m easily, and a DC-DC converter will be used to accept any input voltage for charging ones own supercaps bank.\n\n* **Demand management to utilize the solar electricity fully.** The controller would simply switch non-essential 24 V DC devices on and off, powered directly by the supercaps bank as long as on average more electricity is produced than consumed. On average, because the supercaps can average out some differences: it would be ok to run a washing machine for 30 s at 500 W if 250 W excess production recharges the supercaps in the next 60 s again, at which point the cycle would repeat. For the basic options for demand management, see [this question](https://sustainability.stackexchange.com/q/6521)).\n\n* **UPS and off-grid functionality.** Adding a backup system to prepare for grid outage and even off-rid operation is easily possible. A small generator (fueled by locally produced biogas maybe) that runs occasionally and outputs 30 V DC directly to the supercaps seems better than a battery, as there is no battery degradation and it provides independence from solar conditions. Even batteries would hardly degrade, as they would be hardly in use. But a generator will probably be cheaper than a battery bank covering 3-6 days of low solar irradiation and the increased amount of panels necessary to cover off-grid use in winter.\n\n* **Small MPPT charge controller for low-sun days.** As detailed above, charging supercaps from solar panels does not need a charge controller, just a relay to stop the charging at a target voltage. However, it may make economic sense to use a small (undersized) and thus cheap charge controller that can be matched to arbitrarily oversized solar panel arrays (for example some of the Victron BlueEnergy MPPT charge controllers). In high-yield conditions, the charge controller is not used, and not needed b/c there is an excess of PV energy anyway. In low-yield conditions, it is used, and most useful to extract as much as possible from the now-scarce sunlight. It can also have a double use as the DC-DC converter to import energy from neighbors by a cable.\n\n\n## 6. Alternative for Direct DC Consumption <a name=\"chap-6\"></a>\n\nMost of the base load of a house, esp. in \"developing countries\", consists of LED lighting, computers, TVs and other electronics, all of which internally use DC electricity. So it is possible to reduce ones energy consumption by avoiding the DC \u2192 AC \u2192 DC conversion losses of the supercaps-and-inverter design from above and instead use the DC-DC converters of the devices, directly connected to the supercap bank. So a wall outlet would provide the 20-30 V DC voltage range of the supercap, and a DC-DC converter is connected to that which provides the constant voltage as needed by the device. All AC devices with an external power adapter can be converted to this system by replacing the power adapter with a DC-DC converter with the same output voltage and at least the same output ampacity.\n\nNow it would be impractical if one would have to change ones DC power adapter for an AC power adapter every evening or when too may people use the DC power during a low-sun day. A practical solution would be to _always_ use 24 V DC for the low-powered devices in the house, and 230 V AC directly from the grid for all high-powered devices and for those that cannot be obtained in 24 V DC variants. When avoiding electric cooking, the latter are rarely used and do not make up a large share of the energy consumption, so trying to power them from solar is probably not worth it.\n\nIn this setup, we do not really need the inverter, as the supercaps bank or battery will feed DC consumers directly. But we will need a large AC-DC converter (for example a usual 24 V battery charger) to charge the supercaps bank or battery in parallel if the photovoltaics panels are not bringing in enough power (esp. at night of course). It will be switched on and off by our controller electronics, and it will be ok to do this several times per minute to keep a supercaps bank within its voltage range, or simply to keep it connected in case of a smart charger for a lead-acid battery. So compared to the variant where the supercaps power an inverter, we need 50-75% less supercaps in this case, again decreasing the costs considerably. A 500 W AC-DC converter should be enough, equivalent to a 20 A battery charger for 24 V batteries. Larger households can go to 1000 W.\n\nWhen selling this variant as a product, a range of DC-DC converters and also good sockets and plugs should be offered in parallel. Still, people are used to AC electricity now and all their devices use that, so the AC based variant from above will be the much more marketable variant. (The DC variant as described here can still be promoted as an add-on or extension option, switching solar panel input over to the direct DC circuit as needed.)", "created_at": "2018-09-13 21:42:50.624693", "updated_at": "2020-09-27 21:42:21.749525", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 3586, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 1087.6, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3791, 4, 6782], "is_private": false}, {"id": 34050, "user_id": 1820, "topic_id": 589, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Having struggled with being bi-polar in the past: I love this! \n\nHow do you envision the unGuide to come together?

With a teamwork session to develop each team\u2019s ideas and choose the convenient SDG to work with.\nAll the young entrepreneurs were very excited to start this first workshop. However, the majority of them had simillar difficulties, which are all about organization. They all had a lot of great ideas that can make change and a great impact on the environmental issues. Hence, they didn\u2019t know which one should be used, how can they choose and when they can start and turn it into a beneficial project.\n\n![IMG_7509.jpg](https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/d/df0901a487b20ae04f2013b92bc747a82e943bdf.jpeg)\n\n \n\n![IMG_7518.jpg](https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c3250f58db88ed8e502b77083be025036ca44ce9.jpeg)\n\n \n\n![IMG_7519.jpg](https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/8/860e8ab708e2634610a5e013016570028deb101d.jpeg)\n\n \n\n![IMG_7521.jpg](https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6bcc44ba2bbfc0ee463c66f9644f094571af9cde.jpeg)\n\n \n\n![IMG_7524.jpg](https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/6/67e0e909042a8bcc9a0d839f05798456647c6c3b.jpeg)\n\n \n\n![IMG_7525.jpg](https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/3/3b9cb3f3cac48a7b3fa93dfcf7576e552433dcc7.jpeg)\n\n \n\n![IMG_7570.jpg](https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b2b23a3bdea437a32b04fe32e9b0a7e36a891a99.jpeg)\n\n \n\n![IMG_7572.jpg](https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/2/2db0005550c79e8464aa26f043cf75b982b9dee9.jpeg)\n\n \n\n![IMG_7574.jpg](https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/c/cc79a6c185bdb4a0fca5b77cdb347da9cd2af490.jpeg)\n\nAfter the lunch break, the participants continued the team work and then we started the first Introductory Webinar and live chat with @nadia, Edgeryders Co-founder.\nShe did a global presentation for  **Edgeryders** ,  **MENA YP**  and  **OCI Lab program** .\nAnd a Q&A session to let the participants understand more and they felt free to ask all their questions.\nThis experience was a first for all the participants, having a live chat with an international community and sharing ideas and comments with them was encouraging and motivational so they can do their best for this Hackathon.\n\n![IMG_7541.jpg](https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/2/27f48f070390b8c1063a9ed86513d06643fc9bf3.jpeg)\n\nSecond workshop: Business Model Canvas by  **Makesense** : @jaloun\n\n![IMG_7550.jpg](https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5ded6be97de329fea0b374ac4a4b1b493f389108.jpeg)\n\n \n\n![IMG_7551.jpg](https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/c/cd22ba9b47e400781f824110d6816000086e3bb2.jpeg)\n\n \n\n![IMG_7552.jpg](https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5d65312410b64f0e53a7cd6de06b8111eb4421f2.jpeg)\n\nSecond Webinar and live chat of the day on Product Design with Susanne Stauch.\n\n![IMG_7569.jpg](https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/6/63807be020f1b06264b53df70f42a393e924d633.jpeg)\nAfter the live chat, the participants started to work on the first and second deliverables with the help of  **Go4work**  and  **Makesense** \u2019s professors, in an atmosphere full of energy and vitality.\n\n![3742EB03-F63D-45AB-9875-DAAC06B3E386.JPG](https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9681b65e42d5c6a47e688dfabb48230ab5fd44e4.jpeg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**SECOND DAY: Hack 4 Environment Morocco**\n\nWe started the second day with a brainstorming to see where every group is with the two deliverables.

Most in the crowd seemed to look at me sort of like, \"huh?\"  \n\nAnyway the point is that those of us with a lot of content to offer on the web (like news - we had a ton of it) had almost no chance of luring even modest numbers of people into paying for our initial product, especially if it was such a hassle and expense just to set up to use the thing when those CD services worked with a plain old phone line.\n\nSo, ads...going that route brought us big numbers over time.

I share here a brief summary for the likes of you in particular @nadia @matthias @hazem and @zmorda, also worth noting for you @alberto re: potential in the research network, and you @noemi and @natalia_skoczylas re: museums of the future.   \n\nIn short, what I took away from the meeting is that there are the following areas of happysmala's work as a **start-up studio** where we could collaborate: \n\n* **Crowdsourcing and circular economies**: happysmala's main focus is in collaborative economies and innovation and they have developed a few unique crowdsourcing platforms. The most relevant is one based on the traditional \"savings circles\" of North Africa known as _tentine_ (en fran\u00e7ais). They are in beta testing an online/ mobile based platform for these - [CIWA](https://www.ciwa.io/) - to support the distributed and rotating organisation of savings and credit. I see a particular **opportunity here for the collective/ shared financing of multiple OpenVillage prototypes towards self-sufficiency**. \n\n* **Crowdsolving**: happysmala are a part of the [Yomken](https://www.yomken.com/) network - an open innovation and crowdsolving platform across environmental, industrial and social challenges - who are also our partners on the UNDemocracy Fund proposal for a citizen science project in MENA. See below for an immediate opportunity associated to this. \n\n* **Skills development and new organisational forms**: here happysmala engage in partnerships to experiment with collaboration approaches to create innovation and impact. This is the overarching area where we could look to co-produce a series of workshops/ a retreat/ a programme in their \"start-up studio\" to support members of the OpenVillage R&D ecosystem in skills and business development.\n\n* **Co-living/ co-working spaces**: Like many of us, happysmala see great opportunity in community building meeting programmable property, and are in the process of setting up their first co-living / co-working space in Marrakech for the end of this year, with another coming up in Lisbon. Clearly opportunity to discuss the possibility of this being a part of the OpenVillage house network. \n\n* **Research**: happysmala have engaged in various research/ policy studies and I think it's a good idea for us to keep them in mind on our research projects. \n\n* **Lobbying**: They have been significantly involved in a new legal framework for crowdfunding in Morocco and note @ericasmar that I think it's worthwhile us connecting you with Alberto Alemanno and the folks over at [The Good Lobby](http://www.thegoodlobby.eu/).\n\n* **Museums of the future**: happysmala will shortly be involved in the [We Are Museums](http://www.wearemuseums.com/) international event in Marrakech to experiment with new forms of the digital museum. Let's keep this in mind as we develop the potential of our involvement in UNLive.\n\nThere is **already one immediate and time-specific collaboration opportunity for the participants of the OpenVillage House in Sidi Kaouki** and here I'd like to get your thoughts @matthias and @hazem . happysmala will be launching a crowdsolving campaign with Yomken as early as next week and we're interested in supporting the ideas and prototypes coming out of the house in Sidi K. \n\n@ericasmar, here's a list of the projects as they stand, although can you confirm if there are any others that could benefit from crowdsolving please @matthias/ @hazem  ? One option for next steps is we have **a group skype when I'm in the house with @matthias and some of the project leaders in Sidi K on Friday or Monday**. Thoughts/ possible?\n\n* Toys out of trash: Educational program stimulating the creativity and imagination among underprivileged children. \n* TANDA (Sofien's project): An entrepreneurial road trip to find traditional craftsmen and craftswomen in Africa and assist them to use their designs and expertise for new products to be sold on the international market.\n* Dar Habiba: The first farmstay hospitality business in Sidi Kaouki, Morocco. A joint venture of a local family and Edgeryders community members from Tunisia and Morocco (for planning, digital marketing etc.).\n* Coffee sorter: A small and inexpensive machine to produce higher-value coffee, increasing the income of smallholder coffee farmers.\n* Free mind by Nassim (@zmorda do you have any more info on this?)\n_(*Also relevant, Dorsaf's biohacking space and Yosser's co-working space in Tunisia)_", "created_at": "2018-04-17 15:12:54.856600", "updated_at": "2018-04-17 15:13:06.934487", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 748, "wiki": false, "reads": 25, "score": 265.0, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 1935, 3703, 3811], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17381, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 1096, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Yes, where commons need an enclosure</b>\n\nWell, I see the appeal in what you say, and I'd advocate such a solution for commons resources that are scarce by nature and thus require a contribution from those who benefit from them. For example, the community woods of a village. In such a context, the discussion about an enclosure for the commons is meaningful and relevant to prevent any sort of \"tragedy of the commons\".\n\nYet even with the enclosure of scarce commons, the principle of commons (as I see it) still stands: Provide flatrate access to a group as large as possible without limiting the sustainability of the commons resource. In the case of digital commons (Wikipedia, free software, ...), this means providing flatrate access to everyone since reproducing these commons does not cost anything. It's basically the same discussion they had about free software years ago: Is software still free if it's only free for non-commercial purposes? The agreement is seemingly now: no it's not. Introducing such restrictions or similar ones (\"not to be used by the military\", \"not to be used by government\" etc.) imposes own ethical standards on others and creates a lot of friction in practical usage that limits the potential total benefit of digital commons. For example, with CC-BY-NC-* licences, it's really not always clear what is commercial usage and what's not: Is it only commercial if I earn money with it? Or already when using a CC-BY-NC* illustration on a commercial website?

Some of you might heard of our project through Noemi, she joined us last year for the [Open state of politics](http://www.openstate.cc/politics/) camp. If you are interested in our project you can read about it in Noemis [article](https://edgeryders.eu/t/wir-bauen-zukunft-learning-from-a-community-with-3-kinds-of-showers/7127) she wrote after attending the camp. \n\nAs some of you also might have heard, we are most likely to plan a camp/festival together with edgeryders. To set up in our venue. We are all very exited about that and Henry (who joined the open village in Brussels last year) is currently setting up a task force to start the co-creation process. \n\nMe, I am very much inspired to join you in working on the projects displayed on the retreat website, connect with more of you, to already bond a little more and maybe even start a little co-creation process for the festival? Whatever the time brings, I am up for it. I am also up for giving an introduction to \u201ehow we use sociocracy 3.0 in our project space and as an organizational form within our cooperative\u201c. I am not a professional sociocracy teacher but I joined an intensive training last year in Italy and I am practicing it kind of every day. more or less :-) It is a complex organizational form but slowly we are getting the hang of it. \n\nIn my everyday life I am working on setting up our project, trying to find new ways of sustainable organization. I am working with two wonderful friends in an organization, which creates and runs short retreats and workshops on transformative processes, team process development and coaching. I am also very much into gestalt therapy and will start a 3 year training this fall. I am a freelance podcast and film producer and also project manger. As I am living in a community space I am into community building processes, nature and permaculture.

As long as you are at ground level (or below) this could be manageable. \nBut if you plan to go any higher the structural support requirements will be massive - e.g. really thick concrete walls (really bad CO2 footprint). \nOther points to consider:\n- In terms of hygiene it is often better to keep a smaller volume hotter (70\u00b0C ?) and mix it down with cooler water. That is if you want to use the water besides thermal mass.\n- If for some reason you have a particularly bad year, how do you best avoid coordinated failure? I would hope outright freezing (leading to destroyed container) can be avoided.\n- 27 tons on site are a huge risk, esp. once the things age. Catastrophic failure might be rare, but even gradual leakage would be a major headache.\n- In seismically active areas one would have to look very, very closely at the implications.\n- 27 (plus insulation) cubic meters will take up a significant footprint per person, even more so if the container is round, and worse, has to sit in the center where it gets in the way of everything.\nThis makes me wonder if you would not better turn it into a somewhat thinner column that may be easier to mass produce (extrusion), reinforce it with a fiber sleeve (recycled glass or pitch based carbon), and partially bury it? \n- May require added ground fortification, problematic for retrofits, not suitable on every terrain type.\n- Sensors for leak detection would be needed, but tech has made a good bit of progress on that front in recent years (incl. smart fabrics).\n- Multi-party homes would be interested in having the worst insulation on their parts of the tank, resulting in a race to the bottom dynamic.\n\nA couple of pro-points:\n- Water is a concern in many places, so having quite a bit of it on hand is generally good, and potentially a virtuous circle. Germany is still \"littered\" with public wells, back from the WW3 planning days - this would be even more relevant for most places.\n- Heat is often a underappreciated energy storage solution. Provided it does not raise too many other costs or complications it is often the most long term sustainable of \"batteries\".", "created_at": "2020-01-03 07:55:41.658271", "updated_at": "2020-01-03 07:55:41.658271", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 382, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 22.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [67947], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 34063, "user_id": 2095, "topic_id": 840, "post_number": 13, "raw": "I got this list from a post of someone who was interested to learn about the social enterprises that have an impact.\nSome ideas are innovative others are coworking spaces that have access to databases or projects.

But most homes are not like that or, more accurately, they are like that only in the simplified narratives we create about them. From my experience, there is a lot of hard work involved in building a home both \u2018at home\u2019 and \u2018abroad\u2019.

Wherever I am, I and the people closest to me are never more than one small thread in the worldsong.

BUT, we have never taken on debt, nor do we allow any VC in because it comes with a lot of strings attached - and would force us to have an extractive sustainability/business model. \n\nSometimes I ask myself why I didn't take the path of my contemporaries. Founders of several startups you heard of - soundcloud, prezi etc came out of one Alma Mater and know one oner socially.  You had some obvious choices if you wanted to make money - go into telecoms, military-industrial or...internet business. Many went full on build tech startups where you make money if and when you make an exit.  Perhaps it really comes down to personal history. \n\nI come from a setting where business = old school trade and debt=bad. As in: Running a \"real\" and \"honest\" business is = generating more revenue from people paying to buy your wares than the costs you have making them. Of course this limits the rate at which your business and revenue can grow, but I am cool with it. Also because growth carries costs additional  costs on your health, your relationships etc.  \n\nMy primary moral compass is trying to do good by and care for the wellbeing of people whom I love - not some higher moral standard. This includes all of my business partners, many people in our community. I very much value the sense of being part of a new kind of caring tribe enabled by connectivity - even if people's ideologies and ideas diverge I feel there is a kind of \"thread\" that that weaves us together.  To me building a good business is building a next generation institution which can act as an anchor for a lot of people in a messy, turbulent world. Financial but also social. It is fragile, yes. But it has been around for longer than most tech \"startups\". \n\nAt techfestival in Copenhagen I ran into someone who has been loosely present in Edgeryders, and who convened a large known community. He said that we were one of few communities to still be around after that wave of sharing/gift economy movements (that came out of the financial crisis). \n\n![10460726_10153244341581930_5847713482076468814_n|690x690](upload://uD0hJldbRxB5Y9dPAkITuMmURSL.jpeg)", "created_at": "2019-09-13 07:21:27.866099", "updated_at": "2019-09-13 16:40:49.099115", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 570, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 6.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 55280, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 10159, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Magda is applying, Bruno is the author of the story she brought as application :)", "created_at": "2019-06-17 10:49:09.689118", "updated_at": "2019-06-17 10:49:09.689118", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 14, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 15.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [55276], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 57534, "user_id": 3622, "topic_id": 10446, "post_number": 14, "raw": "Can we have their bio texts/photos ready? @inge @Mikomann", "created_at": "2019-08-04 15:17:59.555748", "updated_at": "2019-08-04 15:17:59.555748", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 10, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 21.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [57415], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 66717, "user_id": 5650, "topic_id": 11813, "post_number": 3, "raw": "![Screenshot_2019-12-02%20Hack4%20Environment%20cairo%20Environmental%20Interface%20platform|416x376](upload://1CFtOGzVUCM58RaGOJePIRdOmDJ.png)", "created_at": "2019-12-02 20:14:49.525379", "updated_at": "2019-12-02 20:14:49.525379", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 13, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 7.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 69175, "user_id": 5860, "topic_id": 12484, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Hello Aziza,\n\nThank you for your interest.\n\nHiba, Co-founder of Diyafa", "created_at": "2020-01-22 08:47:47.639575", "updated_at": "2020-01-22 08:47:47.639575", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 12, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 37.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [6078, 5547], "is_private": false}, {"id": 70071, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 12454, "post_number": 2, "raw": "A post was merged into an existing topic: [Econ-SF: a selection of works and authors](/t/econ-sf-a-selection-of-works-and-authors/8582/121)", "created_at": "2020-02-10 14:54:33.485816", "updated_at": "2020-02-10 14:54:33.595173", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 27, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 57383, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 10448, "post_number": 1, "raw": "_This wiki is an ever evolving draft in which we add our list of proposals-under-development for sessions and speakers.

They provide an opening for extremist propaganda in its inability to contain competing narratives. \n\nThe example: pointing out missing topics in the dominating narrative and claiming the people in power have to be lying if they're neglecting these issues. \n\nExamples:\n\nIYAITI - a game about living in Carribean poor conditions\nFirewatch - game\n\nThe last hijack interactive - experience in which you can see all perspectives of the piracy situation in Somalia \n\n(!!!)

After school there is university; then you take a job, right? It's what sensible people do. I was taught never to question this. It took me a lot of effort to look around and realize that the range of choices at my disposal was far broader than I thought.\u00a0\n\n<div>You\u00a0Bridget, you make such choices seem effortless. Your daughter was not really a good match with your run-of-the-mill schooling, so you stepped in and conjured a totally personalized approach that would fit well with her talents and personality. Just like that! I hated school too, but at the time it was completely unthinkable to do anything else. Is it an eye-of--the-beholder effect? Was it actually a tough, controversial decision? Is it that other people's had choices always seem easier than one's own? Or do you have an uncommon gift for choosing freely, greater than mine anyway?\u00a0</div>Later in the spring, we will have a campaign about education: perhaps you can tell us about your experience as a home schooling parent.

La journ\u00e9e commence par un pointage, et se termine par un pointage. Un rythme immuable. Puis j\u2019ai commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 grandir, \u00e0 voir les choses autrement, \u00e0 voyager et \u00e0 m\u2019affranchir.\n\nDes \u00e9tudes en design, en art floral et puis en restauration d\u2019antiquit\u00e9s (en \u00c9gypte, logiquement). J\u2019ai cru finalement avoir trouv\u00e9 ma vocation, \u00e9tudier, fouiller, d\u00e9blayer et \u00e9tayer, quel bonheur! Et puis, une r\u00e9volution, le pays chamboul\u00e9, les universit\u00e9s ferm\u00e9es, et sur le plan personnel, un cancer. Tout ce qu\u2019il y a de plus normal \u00e0 29 ans!\n\nJ\u2019ai compris ce jour l\u00e0 que mon salaire ne me prot\u00e9geait de rien, quand celui qui le versait ne me voyait que comme une machine de production, et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait tout \u00e0 fait naturel de me mettre \u00e0 la porte suite \u00e0 mes \u00abdysfonctionnements\u00bb. J\u2019ai \u00e9galement appris l\u2019importance de ce que je mangeais, et comment on pouvait se suicider \u00e0 petit feu avec une simple fourchette.\n\nTrop de gras, trop de sucre, trop de sel, des colorants, des conservateurs, des ar\u00f4mes artificiels... Mon snack et mon shampoing ont des allures de famille \u00e0 la lecture de leur composition. On me disait de manger des fruits et des l\u00e9gumes, je veux bien! Mais avez vous la moindre id\u00e9e de la quantit\u00e9 de pesticides utilis\u00e9s par les agriculteurs \u00e9gyptiens chaque ann\u00e9e? L\u2019absence de loi relative aux OGM.

Sans le moindre additif nocif, tenant dans un emballage herm\u00e9tique, pouvant r\u00e9sister \u00e0 toutes les conditions climatiques, pour presque rien. On faisait une collecte chaque semaine, et j\u2019achetais avec l\u2019argent amass\u00e9 des produits de saison, bio dans la limite de ce que je trouvais, puis les pr\u00e9parais avec tout mon amour, depuis chez moi.\n\nJe suis gu\u00e9rie, et depuis moins d\u2019un an, je suis retourn\u00e9e en Tunisie, avec une seule id\u00e9e en t\u00eate. Faire de notre pays le num\u00e9ro 1 mondial producteur de \u00abHealthy food and snacks\u00bb.\n\nAGAMA (Nature en Amazigh), \u00e9tait n\u00e9e! Mon r\u00eave s\u2019est agrandi, et au del\u00e0 de la finalit\u00e9 du produit en soi, d\u2019autres champs de bataille se sont impos\u00e9s.

Avec ce concept, je voudrais donner aux familles dans les zones agricoles une arme contre la pr\u00e9carit\u00e9, donner \u00e0 leurs enfants une raison de ne pas quitter leurs terres et aller se perdre litt\u00e9ralement dans les grandes villes qu rechignent \u00e0 les accueillir.

On ne vous donne pas d\u2019argent sans d\u00e9claration de soci\u00e9t\u00e9, et on ne veut d\u00e9clarer votre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 sans argent. Un interminable cercle ferm\u00e9.\n\nJ\u2019ai pu rencontrer des investisseurs priv\u00e9s qui ont eu la perspicacit\u00e9 de voir tout le potentiel d\u2019AGAMA, mais \u00e7a n\u2019a jamais abouti, car mon attachement aux id\u00e9es du commerce \u00e9quitable et mon engagement \u00e0 venir en aide \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes associations ne sont pas en parfaite ad\u00e9quation avec la vision purement capitaliste de ces investisseurs.\n\nPourtant, je veux faire d\u2019AGAMA une r\u00e9ussite sur le plan financier \u00e9galement, car de cette mani\u00e8re seulement elle pourra s\u2019agrandir et aider encore plus de gens.\n\nEdegeryders pourra \u00eatre l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 je pourrais finalement rencontrer des interlocuteurs qui partagent non seulement mes id\u00e9aux et mes r\u00eaves, mais \u00e9galement cette fa\u00e7on saine d\u2019envisager le commerce et le business. Des personnes qui ont leur propre v\u00e9cu, des exp\u00e9riences, des solutions... Une communaut\u00e9 de cette envergure doit \u00e9galement avoir des contacts, et c\u2019est une chose qui me fait d\u00e9faut en Tunisie.

What happens when they figure these things out? What kinds of companies do they fund and what are the returns? How do they raise their fund and manage their portfolio? \n\nMaybe this is the evolution of today's impact investor.

This panel, titled 'Problems in distributed systems we need to solve', took an interesting turn when the moderator asked a question about the 'blockchain space'. Data Terra Nemo is a conference on decentralized p2p technologies, and yet the word 'blockchain' was usually only mentioned as the butt of a joke. Some of the technologies discussed (like [Wireline](https://www.wireline.io) and [Circles](https://joincircles.net/)) use blockchain in their stack of technologies, but their creators both 'owned up to it' during their talks, being very aware of the status of the 'b-word'. Their jabs at the \"blockchain space\" were not very serious, but the jokes were telling. \n\nBasically, what has happened is this. As 'crypto' became a fad and a repeat of the dotcom crash, 20 years later, many people building decentralized technologies have seen their scene flood with money going to really bad ideas and sloppy technology. This has been particularly frustrating since there was never any money for any decentralized technologies before the blockchain bubble, and once it arrived, most of it went up in smoke with the core projects solving hard computing problems mostly going unfunded. One panelist summed it up as that the people in the decentralized p2p space felt they were working on hard and important problems, while the developers in the blockchain space were solving issues that were more trivial. There was also an anecdotal story on that the blockchain companies were starting to have problems hiring good developers, even when offering big paychecks because the social status of working in that space was so low among talented software engineers.\n\nAt the same time, the influx of money into the crypto/blockchain space created a parallel culture, which has not only attracted golddiggers but quite a lot of honest and talented people working on interesting ideas, and all of the panelists but one admitted to both having been funded by \"crypto money\" and many agreed that there were things to learn from \"the other side\". They also pointed to a few technological challenges that the blockchain-side was getting right, that they were not yet keeping up with. One panelist also made the comparison with the dotcom crash \u2013 most of it was garbage, but a few gems survived and had great success for decades to come.\n\nA few days later, I went to a [DGOV](https://dgov.foundation/) meetup organized by @phoebe. A group of very idealistically motivated people was sitting around a table in a humble office talking about how to bring the benefits of DAOs to the governance space. I gave a lightning talk on how there is a lot of amazing decentralized technology being developed outside of the blockchain space and decided to bring the full story from DTN under the 'don't shoot the messenger' principle. Their response was very earnest and humble, completely acknowledging the shortcomings of the blockchain space and that the enormous influx of cash had done harm to the community.\n\nAnd there is plenty of room in which to collaborate. Many of the ideas being built on blockchains would benefit greatly from being paired with technologies discussed at DTN. In fact, one such initiative is Wireline, who sponsored the DTN conference and gave an interesting demo on their platform for creating distributed p2p web applications.\n\nI think there might be an opportunity to do some good work here. There is still a lot of blockchain-money out there, and perhaps more importantly \u2013 that term has the eyes and ears of countless of people around the world. Those working for a human-centric internet should use this to their advantage.\n\n* First of all, policy-makers and investors need to broaden their perspective and look at the entire spectrum of distributed p2p technologies \u2013 no just the small subset that is blockchain.\n* Currently, the blockchain space is vastly more funded than the rest of the space. It might be in the interest of the big players in the blockchain space, who now have the ears and attention of their investors, to use some of that social capital to redirect attention towards a larger picture. \n* Blockchain influencers sit on a lot of attention capital which they could use to explain the wider implications of the decentralized p2p web to the public \n* Finally, those of us with a fanatic streak (I have been guilty of cursing the B-word myself in the past) might need to move past that into a more integrated perspective to start working together.", "created_at": "2019-05-28 23:46:20.050367", "updated_at": "2019-07-01 16:59:41.969827", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 819, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 288.8, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2915, 4861, 4, 5083, 1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 69187, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 12261, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Hi @Bogi nice to meet you, congrats for the courage to post online!\nI have moved out of my home country some time ago, and wrote about the new bubbles you become part of as a migrant:\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/i-grew-up-in-post-communism-in-a-fractured-generation-each-with-its-own-bubble/9369\n\nWere you part of the workshop in Brno? if so, what did you learn that you would like to see explored further?

What are you learning from this crisis that informs how we\u2019re thinking about responding to other crises, like global climate change?\n\nWe want to run a campaign to find and engage individuals to re-publish good content that they have produced and disseminated elsewhere onto our platform. As well as to engage people to discuss it here. So that we can grow a conversation around it, find/see the invisible threads that connect seemingly unrelated topics and conversations that are happening right now. The findings will form the basis for a series of summits to be held later in the year.\n\n## What we need help with\n\nPrepare the materials for the campaign to make it engaging and easy for people to add their content, have it discussed with others and get it have it included in the booklet we will collaboratively produce out of this all (a simplified version of a Booksprint that takes place here on the edgeryders platform).\n\nIn parallel with this we want to reach out to different organisations that can partner with the effort to draw more visiblity and recognition for the participants who contribute to this work. Rather than have the clever insights the produce vanish into a facebook or twitter feed, we want possible collaborators, clients, funders, employers etc to acknowledge the value of their input and send more opportunities their way.\n\n# Wait, but Why?\n\n#### Because if you want to go far, you need to go with others!\n\nIt is no secret that the Edgeryders scene skews eclectic and nerdy. As in: we are better at doing interesting things than getting them out there so more people can discover and support them. We have miraculously gotten some press coverage in international and national media over the years. Funders and clients have shown up at our \"doorstep\" unsolicited - amongst them fairly large ones. And we know what we do is dope. \n\nWe have been quietly acting at the fringes till now. But we are getting signals that our work could help a lot of people weather the current situation, and the storms that will soon be upon us due to climate change + ecosystems. It is high time to get the work *out there* in a more structured and consistent way - starting with the booksprint + summit activities taking place over the next 6 months. \n\n### Partnership building & Promotion work\n\nSo we are looking for a group of several people who can identify and engage relevant organisations to support the booksprint and or the summits that will follow. This includes potential media partners, funding bodies etc.  This will require a team of people who can work together to make this happen.\n\n We are a global community of people in 80+ countries, rural as well as urban. **BUT: Our funding sources require us to ensure that we are engaging people in Belgium, Germany, Poland, Czechia, Serbia, France, Italy and Tunisia....**\n\n#### Creative Collaborative Research campaign\n\nWe need to find and engage individuals who have posted good content to participate in the booksprint. Some of this will consist of using search engines, hashtags etc. But in general the most effective way to do this is to crowdsource leads.  So we need a clever way to do this, a kind of mini campaign that makes it fun and easy for people to help us find \"best of\" content that they have seen others post. And then reach out to people who are already following us on our different social media channels & invite them to the party :) Have a look at Kelsey's approach for inspiration: https://twitter.com/raeBress\n\n# Timeline\nWe want to get started with this immediately. We would like to start with a 2 month engagement to see how things work out and if all goes well we see this continuing till december. We are a small not for profit organisation: Our ability to generate paid work opportunities for everyone depends in part on the promotion and research crew doing a great job.\n\n# Resources we have at our disposal\n### A network & budget for Coordination + freelance Copywriters, illustrators, videomakers etc\nTell us how you would like to approach the work, and what you need to do this well. We can then reach out to our network to find the right people.\n\n### A team of researchers to help us turn our conversations into collective intelligence\n@amelia @Leonie @CCS read all posts and conversation threads, then tag them. @Alberto then turns them into visualisations which allow us to get a bigger picture of what the conversation looks like. Together their work results in an easy to understand, visual overview of what connections people in the different discussions are making between experiences, topics, concepts and initiatives. These videos we made for a course give a good idea of what this involves:\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/410069933\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/410071707\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nIf you want to learn more about this, get in touch with the crew by introducing yourself in the open research workspace: https://edgeryders.eu/c/research-network\n\n### Experienced community managers\n@johncoate @noemi and @MariaEuler help ensure the space is welcoming and inclusive, connect people across shared interests and help move the conversations forward towards action. But what do we mean when we say \"community\" and \"community management\"? Again some materials from a course we developed to teach others how to do this:\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/410087848\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/410075559\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n### Always-on video chat meeting rooms\n\nThese are intended for things like running online events where you need breakout rooms, running team meetings or even for just hanging. They are only available to people with [edgeryders.eu](http://edgeryders.eu/) accounts. If you want to create your own you can do so by posting a request in a comment below. We will follow up with a few questions in a direct message to be sure everyone is aligned in how the room is to be used and then open a room for you. [Example here](https://now.edgeryders.eu/room/community?fbclid=IwAR1GMjc6SCd9ASrD4E8nDfA1afWvzvMCkHWZ__prp6RgS-f6psfRhF2s6U0).\n\n### Active Online Community Forums with built in sensemaking tools\n\nRelevant because: This enables us to easily connect with others interested in the same topics. Deepen the discussions. Build visualisations to show points of convergence with others as a foundation for potential collaborations around emergent insights.\n\n### Registration forms for events that smoothly onboard participants onto online forums\n\nRelevant because: we want to make it easy for people to connect and start the conversations before, and after the event. So that the webinars are part of a fruitful, action oriented process rather than something you just \u201cconsume\u201d. Example from previous event: [https://register.edgeryders.eu](https://register.edgeryders.eu/)\n\n### Tiered access online landing pages\n\n**Webinars or Screen videos with password-protected livechat.**  This is very useful for when you want to have different levels of access. For example you may want to limit access to people who participated in the preparatory conversations or participated in a previous activity. It is also useful if you want to do crowdfunding campaigns where one of the perks is to have one\u2019s questions featured during the webinar. Example here: https://live.edgeryders.eu/\n\n### Campaign builder\n\n**We have developed a stack of modules that enable you to quickly set up a single purpose minisite and it with relevant content** .This makes it easy and inexpensive to so things like set up a website around a specific activity such as conference or crowdfunding campaign. As well as present content picked from the online forum that enables your to feature discussion threads or high quality posts with little additional work.

I have been exploring and sharing my ideas in talks and workshops since, but have not committed to start a more practical project yet.\nI have met self-constructed hurdles (not having enough knowledge or grit to lead a project in this field) as well as problems in the realms of time and financial constraints, and more broadly in human biology and psychology and the current design of our social, political, educational systems driving behaviour towards undesirable directions.\nI would love to offer my ideas, energy, reflection and potential collaboration to any who is traveling a similiar path.\n\n**Great, now that you've made it easier for us to introduce you to the others \u2013 start to think about the topic and purpose of the event itself.

It is also about seasonnal productions, better quality of products (implying less quantities of them, and slower food consumption), using timeless agro-ecologic methods. **It is about keeping it local, social, and human scaled.**\n**They also improve the creation of contributive communities**, from the organisation to the distribution, empowering the link between farmers and consumers.

Its main goal is to be **an easy way to contribute to an harmonious way to eat fresh food**.\nWe, as consumers, are or can be part of this positive model, We try these solutions, we adapt to them, we agree with the services they give. **Why shouldn't we share them?**\nCreating a map-based network for fresh and local food diggers, by the diggers themselves.\nMapping the spots and places, sharing infos and intel about them, with anybody looking for the same solutions as we are.\n**A contributive and easy-to-use open source platform**. Making us able to know more about the places we live in, and what is happening on the other side of the world on the same topic, around the same ideas.

Here is what it's wanting to be as a platform:\n_- contributive_\n_- borderless and international_\n_- non-commercial and non-promotionnal_\n_- owned by none but the contributors_\n_- anonymous_\n\n**It is a map that wants to allow anybody to share or get places, adresses and services anonymously, anywhere.**\nThose places are (for now) classified as following:\n_- baskets (little assorment of fruits and vegetables distributed)_\n_- urbangardens (where you can grow or get fruits or vegetables)_\n_- cooperatives (locations owned by farmers or so)_\n_- shops_\n_- markets_\n\nThose places that we're going to mark on the map, have to be essentially distributing local and short-circuit food. There is no way we want to see supermarkets with a small local food service there being pinted on the map... ahah\n\n## HOW can I contribute ?\n\nVery easily indeed! You know places ans services around you? You have a computer or a smartphone?\nHere are two ways to contribute to the map:\n<p></p>\n**_ON SMARTPHONE:_**\n\nYou just have to launch [the page with the map](https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/fr/map/l-o-c-a-m-a-p_202838) in your browser of choice. The map is now in front of you and you can consult it, by cicking on the point already marked, and check details. You will also see that there is a bunch of buttons that can be used, here are those wich are going to make you a contributor:\n\n**1/** **click on the pen** on the corner up right, to access the **edition menu**\n**2/** click **the first button**, with the \"map marker\" form ; there, uMap asks you to **pin the location of the spot on the map**, just do it :slight_smile:\n**3/** a menu pops automaticaly: **pick the kind of services** you're marking (urbangarden, basket, etc)\n**4**/ write the **name**, and give a small and concise **description** of the service (in one parapgraph only)\n**5/** click on **Save** and be sure you're deeply thanked for your contribution :smiley:\n\nhere is a gif of these steps:\n<img src=\"https://circa1984blog.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/output_h3uslz.gif?w=433&h=770\">\n<p></p>\n**_ON A COMPUTER:_**\n\nAs the smartphone method relies on a internet page opened in a browser, the method is exactly the same on a computer, as you just need to open the same page in your browser, and follow the same steps.\n\nHere is a gif for computer users:\n\n<img src=\"https://circa1984blog.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/output_ee1z3r.gif?w=656&h=330\">\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n\n## SEMANTIC and DIVERSITY\n\n**As local food models are preserving the bio-diversity** of plants, vegetables, fruits, all linked to specific terroirs and knowledges, **it appears natural / logical for Locamap to share this preservation of diversity drive**, and include this concepts in its core.\nOn the human and social aspect of such a thing, we all are coming from different places, cultures and terroirs. We sometimes are travellers, migrants, or deeply rooted in the same place for a life-long time. Whatever. **We don't cook things the same way, and we don't name things the same way as well. And this is a precious diversity.**\n**We need to preserve this, by completing the map in the local language and alphabet.**\nAs you can see, the map shows international names for places and countries and cities... **Let's make this a whole workflow.**\n\nFor instance, if @hazem marks some point in Egypt, let it be written in egyptian arabic. If he writes some in Germany, let them be written in german.\nAnd for those of us that will be travelling there, let's be curious and translate that by ourselves! :slight_smile:\n\nPreservation of local food cycles is not an isolated stand. It shares many intersections with others, and shouldn't let itself be driven out of a big-pictured and intersectionnal vision.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n## MORE INFOS about this opened to all edgeryders beta-test:\n\n3 weeks ago, I launched the first phase of the platform test, with french speaking people \"recruited\" via FB and Mastodon. We were 20 to be involved in the project during this time. 5-6 contributed, wich means 20-25% give or less.\nI wanted to extend the test to a more wide and international community, and as Edgeryders has been related to this project somehow since this, it was a natural move for me to trust Edgeryders community in this process.\n\n**I'm planning on a month of test with you here**, and see what we can do in that time.\nBy that I mean getting markers on the map of course, but also discussing the project form, governance, insights, and design. It can start from just pin a place on the map to share ideas about this grey style I've chosen for now, through thinking the governance or moderation model of such a contributive and libre tool.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n## CONFIDENTIALITY and SHARING POLICIES:\n\nEdgeryders is a public platform, where anybody is able to see this article, the links in it, and what is discussed. As I don't have the permission to making this post a community-only reading, I trust you guys to not share it publicly on other platforms. We can of course discuss that point ;)\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\nNow, go! Looking forward to see the markers popping here and there on this grey map. Let's put some colors on it!\n\nAnd definitely looking to read your comments and feedbacks on it as well!\n\nThank you!", "created_at": "2018-05-04 13:34:05.547969", "updated_at": "2018-05-29 19:24:44.407407", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1399, "wiki": false, "reads": 20, "score": 311.0, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 4265, 3293, 2095, 1935, 4566], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10076, "user_id": 162, "topic_id": 1197, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Great idea, high time!</b>\n\nThis is a great idea and I am very happy that this idea is being floated.

Edgeryders is a (hopefully special) case of a website with a long history spanning across two Drupal distributions (one based on Drupal 6, another one on Drupal 7). So, not only do we have a team that shifts, but we also have the same people that changed their user IDs across time as the old data were migrated onto the new platform. I was user 4 on the old Drupal 6, and am user 34 on the present website. I would definitely keep the idea of exporting the roles as they are on the Drupal DB, and then leaving it to the community managers to interpret the data. In the case in which dropping administrators does not make sense, you would simply <em>not</em> uncheck the box. A more sophisticated approach consists of printing one box per user role (there are two roles in Edgeryders, besides registered user) and letting the analyst include or exclude them.\u00a0\n\nAn alternative way of doing the same would be to let the user specify a list of people to count as \"team\".\u00a0\n\nBut here is a question for <a href=\"/u/matthias\">@Matthias</a>. My old account was merged with the new one. As a result, old posts and comments (of which there are a lot) are attributed to my current user, which is 34. User 34 is an administrator in Edgeryders. So why does it look like current administrators did nothing in 2011-2012? Are old posts still attributed to the legacy ID instead of the ID the legacy users were merged with?\n\n", "created_at": "2014-06-01 16:16:19", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:44.407157", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 279, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 10.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [29870], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 47062, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 8971, "post_number": 4, "raw": "I have just merged Anu's manual in the first post into our main [Dynalist Manual](/t/id/7618) (section 4).

However, the whole point of this story is that, once you get into a sharing mentality via (easy) online sharing, that makes it more natural to you share even in slightly harder contexts. To prove the point, my wife and I are now active in the Airbnb community, putting our guest room up for people to use when they pass through. It has been a nice experience so far: no problem at all, and we have spent some nice evenings chatting away with our guests.\n\nNow we are taking it to the next level, and are <a href=\"http://cookiesncode.com/2012/03/31/living-social-in-brussels/\">seeking for housemates</a> to share a home in Brussels. The whole idea is that we tried being a migrant nuclear family, just the two of us in our own apartment, and we don't like it, we are too lonely (when we were in Italy we had access to a network of friends, but since we moved out we have been cut off from it). So we would like to explore a more sociable way of living.\n\nSo, you see, I guess sharing online can be like a gym, where your sharing muscles are trained for further challenges.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-13 09:25:12", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:02.471029", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 226, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [13171], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 47842, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 6087, "post_number": 11, "raw": "Yes.

Started in 'appear.in' but it was really laggy so we moved to Google hangouts.\n\nMy feeling was that I'd be more likely to put effort into the open care thing if I believed it would come up with concrete results (e.g. helping people / reducing suffering) , if it was just making a big document that got read and largely ignored, I'd feel it was a waste of time, and I think everyone will share this feeling.\n\nI think Nadia agreed, and said that we could/should try to get some concrete change from this project (as well as fulfilling the minimum requirements of providing the research / ideas / documentation.)\n\nFor the research part, I thought the only way to actually know what is going on would be to go to places where health care is needed, and talk to people first hand. Get a feel for their situation. (Rather that trusting info sources from others). So I think we could get people to visit anywhere that seems like it might lack good health care and talk to people in need, and the people giving the care. e.g. Refugee camps, impoverished inner city areas where there are too many people and not enough doctors / hospitals. Rural areas where it's hard for people to get health care. Go to places, talk to people get first hand accounts, do surveys and get numbers.\n\nFor stats / raw data , I'd want to know:\n\n* How many doctors/clinics/hospitals there are in the area.\n\n* How the health care is funded: (is it governments paying with taxes? Charities? The communities themselves dealing with the problems, without outside help?)\n\n* How do people get to the health care when they need it? distance? cost?\n\n* How long do they have to wait? satisfaction with the care they receive?\n\n* How many people need care and are not getting it?\n\netc.\n\nSomeone (forgot name) asked an important question: Does our client (client?) care about the situation in America, or because it's EU money do they not care about far away places, with maybe completely different situations / cultures?\n\nFor the UK, an important question i would like answered is: 'how good is the NHS?' Are they doing the right thing, and only limited by lack of money, Or could their methods / efficiency be improved? If so, how? How could they improve? Better software / organisation? a change in culture?\n\n(I know they wasted a ton of money on software, cos they gave money to some lame suit and tie company instead of getting real hackers that smoke weed. But I guess that's really a separate issue.)\n\nTo me, the most exciting idea would be to get hackers involved in health care. Healing people is (often / can be) easy when you apply creativity and radical tech and hacker problem solving mentality.\n\nI think an important question raised was 'is the legal side preventing this from happening more? Or will it get in our way?'\n\nMaybe hackers are put off operating on people cos they might get sued if it goes wrong? Or 'pretending' to be a dentist is illegal and only people with official training should be allowed to mess with teeth?\n\n(Issues with stuff like law getting in the way of common sense hacking with pacemakers cos of stupid patent laws / lack of open software ?)\n\nNadia said we can find people with expert legal knowledge, and see what the situation is.\n\n(Common wisdom is that dentistry is very difficult and takes 7 years training, or whatever. I can see why this makes sense. It *is* very difficult and can get very bad results if it goes wrong, so obviously 'amateurs' should not hack teeth.\n\nHowever, I actually think this is not as obvious as some may think. When talking about starting a radical hacker community on an island, one of the points that came up, is can we really mange without any outside help? What if someone has tooth problems, should we consider this when deciding on location? I said 'we can't do dentistry, it's too hard' but some in our crew actually thought it was not beyond the realms of possibility. He would have to spend a few hours reading, and time making specialised equipment (drills, maybe X-ray machine, etc) and make our own morphine (actually that's the easy bit, but general anaesthetic can be tricky/dangerous). So anyway, I'm not suggesting it will be common place in the near future for people to get their teeth fixed at hackerspaces. Just wanted to point our that genius hackers can do amazing / crazy high tech things if they have the time. Nothing is beyond us. So I imagine it could be very feasible for hackers to help with more simple aspects of health care, and there is no reason that they should not be allowed to do so. )\n\nAlso mentioned: hackers making rucksacks for refugees.\n\nWhat about shelters for homeless? I've always been keen on squatting, using tech knowhow to get abandoned buildings into liveable states.\n\nThis is not directly health care, but you can argue prevention is better than needing to cure. E.g. if people are living on the streets or extreme poverty where they can't keep warm and dry, and wash, of course they are more like to get sick and have many health problems.\n\nSo the thing that excites me the most is getting hackers involved in radical change like this.\n\nNadia said that actually getting positive change was something we could and should be doing (even though technically we don't have to DO anything, just provide research / ideas).\n\nSo she suggested that I could help organise an event in London, where we get hackers together, and see what we can do.\n\nSo I think a big event with lots of hackers would be good.\n\nNadia mentioned planing to do something in London, and in June. Not sure why London (just cos I was keen to help, and i know London?) or were you thinking of doing something in London anyway? and why June? dunno. but anyway, that seems feasible.\n\nThe minimum i would expect from this, is just lots of brainstorming / ideas by smart hackers that we can document and add to the report.\n\nThe best case, would be if something more long term came out of it, and they ended up improving health care in London.\n\nLondon hackspace would be the logical place to host it (and I know the members and trustees very well).\n\nSo if you guys think that sounds like it's worth doing, I will contact them and see what they feel and if there is any support / excitement about the idea. They would probably allow the space to be used for free, but if we wanted a lot of people and for more than one day, it could be a nice gesture to offer to donate some money from the grant for use of the space. (it's entirely non-profit and run by members) (they did look into charity status, but decided against it)\n\nNormally it's members only, but they will make exceptions for special events (and a lot of the people interested would be members anyway).\n\nI know one or two members that are involved in edgeryders, so I would also contact them.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n", "created_at": "2016-03-15 23:45:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:59.176366", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1311, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 15.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2201], "is_private": false}, {"id": 72352, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 12945, "post_number": 27, "raw": "[quote=\"nadia, post:1, topic:12945\"]\n*With Marco and Martin\u2019s projects as the use cases.*\n[/quote]\n\nDoes someone know Marco's handel on the platform?", "created_at": "2020-03-24 14:40:11.852662", "updated_at": "2020-03-24 14:40:11.852662", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 26, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 19.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [72252], "is_reply_to": [72252], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 82457, "user_id": 1450, "topic_id": 14283, "post_number": 7, "raw": "Rural coworking feels like a big opportunity to bridge some of the social divides in commuter towns/villages. i.e. there's generally some hostility/suspicion towards people living in a rural community, but working in the city.

Public trust in the operators was low, and they messed up so bad that *the whole spectrum* of political parties dropped them.\n\nHad they been safe I am sure that Allianz or Munich Re or similar would have privately piped up and said they'll insure them for a competitive rate. Alas here we are. Even if we had a hefty CO2 tax - I don't think that would have saved them economically (esp. vs wind).\nI believe additional nails in the coffin were:\n- blunders and uncertainties around decommissioning and storage\n- Simulations of the economic knock on effects of a serious incident (+ the very high plausibility of one when looking at Japan's capabilities, committment, and track record). In effect such an event would end a good chunk of the agri industry's competitiveness, and had a chance to make a serious dent in other industries.\n- The direct cost in human lives would have been negligible (if you permit a bit of cynicism)\n- The long term costs to society were not modeled afaik\n\nShould Germany get back INTO fission when it becomes significantly safer? Maybe. Note that many of the power stations were already in extended lifetime. Would that incurr extra \"restart costs\". Maybe some, but afaik Grmany was already behind a good bit in tech, so we would've likely switched to French, Chinese, or did something German-Russian.\nBut at that time people will be paying (likely significantly more than) the 90 bn projected for decommissioning. So I am skeptical a realistic case can be made, even when numbers would be for it.\n\nFission aside, is there anything that can \"save us\"? \nFusion? In my opinion less chance to make a dent in the next 50-100 years than wind alone. I like fusion, I'm friends with some people working in the research, I live in a place that profits from ITER funding, I admire the ingenuity, etc. \nBut even if ITER's granddaughter turns out to be perfect it will not deliver a constant source of power, but it will be pulsing. We're currently at 70s pulses, ITER MIGHT do 400s to 600s. Yes, that is planned so you can design demand around it - but so is wind, solar, and tide / water to a DEGREE and this is where come closer to the crucial point in my opinion:\nOf course you'll need to adapt economic activity to seasons and similar. This has been true for millions of years in every place in most critical activities, and was only not true in some places, at the height of the fossil fuel glut. \nSeaonality and internittency is the absolute norm. Always on at max is not how we'll be learning to live responsibly I'm afraid. \n\nSome points we can do with regard to climate (German example):\n- Switch from coal to gas capacity immediately (IMO keep coal as fallback, be transparent, diplomatic (Russia's neighbors) and EU-clever with the Russian suppliers) - DUH!\n- Fund some nuke r&d (decommissioning, have foot in door & help with promising concepts)\n- Make tgeoretical and legal framework for a supply side driven economy, incentives to manage (economic) activity with less constant power, ICT to the rescue!\n- very quietly start funding a diverse range of \"thought leaders\" to inform decision makers of plausible scenarios of what might happen if we start dumping sulphuric acid into the high atmosphere in an uncoordinated fashion (the most likely geo-engineering trick that people are going to pull out of the hat)\n- Review technical / building / transport standards with and eye towards CO2 optimization potential. Example: if you could use more wood for housing construction, growing a lot of forests would start making sense as a carbon sink. But the risk of fire is why we simply forbid a lot of it in building codes. We could step up efforts to research tech that makes such fires less common and less catastrophic. For example: a decent (usb-)cable tester, and a practice of having non-flammable material under or near shitty electronics, or old lithium batteries.\n- Research and scale potential large carbon sinks such as \"seaweed landfills\" that are likely to outperform trees with factor of more than 20.\n- Consider legal action on behalf of future generations vs decision makers who essentially halted buildout of wind power in Germany on essentially spurious grounds (What is going to happen if you quit nukes, then drop solar (you're welcome China!), then drop wind as well, and shield automotive?

When people are free? Cosyncronising with other events/happenings?\n\nOh, who am I? I am Peter, and a big part of my focus for the near future will be on helping Dorotea organise this. (Here's my data: http://bwcd.vdcn.org/doku.php/people:peter http://bwcd.vdcn.org/doku.php/discussion:images)\n\nI may well have gone to the last LOTE, if I had known about it.\n\nI always want to double things. So if you say you want 200 people, I say 'let's shoot for 400!' (not at!).\n\nIs 400 too many? I'm confident we can hit this number. And not just any old people, excellent people. (but unexcellent people won't be excluded, of course (Or will they?)).\n\nAnd given 200+ people, I think plenty of space for camping would be a big plus. It could work if people are hosted in many different places, couchsurfer style, and attending meetings in one central location. But I'm thinking it would be cool for everyone to be sleeping in the same place, and have the meetings in giant tents or something. Then there is no issue with people needing to leave cos they have to catch public transport back to their hosts, or whatever. The meetings can go on all night! Thoughts?\n\n((And then a wild idea comes to mind: What if we contrive some way to own the land, then we never have to leave the unDojo. It's not a priority to go this far, just... what if? Is anyone inspired by the thought? You know what? I might buy the land for the tent village, but not tell anyone. Then after a cool first week, 70% of the people will say 'hey, i wish we could stay for a few more days (cos our subgroup still hasn't finished this cool project we're working on)\" and I'll be like \"You can. No problem. I know the guy that owns this land and he's pretty chill\". Then soon enough people will forget about asking if they have to leave, and they'll lose track of time, and magical things will be produced unMon sty-lee (pigs). . . . . . . . . . . Do I live in an insane castle in the sky? Yes, but it's real! History will be the judge. If you grok with this idea, dare to dream with me. If you don't grok, no worries, Dorotea will give you a cool LOTE no matter what.

Participants are just human sensors or data processors.\n\nThis goes against the citizen science we put in the spotlight during the festival, where citizens are active agents in every phase of the research from ideation over planning all the way to conclusions. This is more intense and inevitably involves technology. We'll have demos in the program so it's not necessary to put them in the urban game.\n\nThat being said, we can also design our own 'citizen science' project around anything that can be measured.

Yet, I feel too narrowed and some initiatives of mine are simply out of scope... \n\nSo let me tell you a story that make me start a new project on my spare time. There is digital divide between the North and Africa. In a few words, we're still too passive consumers of goods even digital goods from the North. Everybody know about it but it's blatant when you look on the statistics. \n\nWhen [some googler do some stats on opensource developers and contributors all around the world he doesn't even dare talking about Africa](https://medium.com/@hoffa/the-top-github-projects-per-country-92c275e19409). It's only after some african guy ask him politely why Africa is absent from his work that he [did publish a complementary article to adress this issue](https://hackernoon.com/the-map-i-got-for-africa-8c8a958c686d). Yet, Africa is on the margin of the global IT community.\n\nYet, poverty or lack of equipment doesn't explain alone this divide. Digital goods are the easiest one we can produce from the South and the marginalized communities in the North. After all computers laptops are more cheaper than factories. And opensource softwares are free as in speech and most in the time as in lemonade (no beer thanks ;) for God sake. \n\nWhen I met some local opensource contributors I understood that our IT industry and education is either old-fashioned or focusing on subcontracting low-value jobs European don't want to do. Worst, our youth seems to not be aware of their own skills and abilities and accept their fate. Their self-esteem is at a low level and most of them are dreaming about migration to the North. The more brilliant ones are connected to global communities (from the North) chatting with Eric and Irene (sorry guys). Yet, they don't even know each other.  They've barely heard about Muhammad or Aissatou who are doing the same exciting kind of stuff. The ironic part is that when they'll get into the first world, they'll still be subcontractor paid in Euros but still subcontractors from the South. I know it since I come from this context.\n\nSo my project is about empowering this untaped highly skilled bunch of women and men to become more connected to this global opensource community. First step, I'm creating an online tool that will gamify opensource contributions and create a sense of community. Second, still thinking about it needs more people input from the ground.\n\nregards,\nBader", "created_at": "2017-08-24 19:36:15.514331", "updated_at": "2018-05-28 09:51:03.092390", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 552, "wiki": false, "reads": 24, "score": 674.8, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 4, 1935, 3830, 3520, 4040], "is_private": false}, {"id": 83611, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 14414, "post_number": 4, "raw": "@LauraRoddy, these summaries are also for NGI?\nIf so, could you ping **\"marina\"** and **\"Markus_D\"** below each of the newsletters?", "created_at": "2020-09-23 15:44:12.011186", "updated_at": "2020-09-23 15:44:51.574319", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 20, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 28.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [6455], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62408, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 11277, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Thanks - are you also producing the materials/ content of the messages to push out?", "created_at": "2019-10-28 16:52:05.763068", "updated_at": "2019-10-28 16:52:05.763068", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 14, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 11.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 69851, "user_id": 6292, "topic_id": 12601, "post_number": 1, "raw": "**Please provide us with contact information about you.**\n\n**name:** Doha Nahhal\n**birthplace:** Casablanca\n**residence:** Morocco\n\n**Please read the projects' descriptions in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hNma4nO7n2_Kd7_L4_Ur2eDHCi1nQmlU41CwHKERqhM/edit\">this file</a> and write down the project names of the ones you're interested in contributing.<br/><br/> Which Project(s) do you want to be involved in?

Or does the difference in governance and motivation make all the difference?\n[/quote]\n\nI was trained as an industrial economist. We have a standard way of looking at this: yes, monopolies are always bad because they limit the freedom of the consumer/user to walk away and go find another supplier to his or her liking. *But* sometimes monopolistic provision is way more efficient than pluralistic provision. Classic example are aqueducts: having five competing networks delivering water to your tap would be very, very inefficient. Water provision is a natural monopoly.\n\nIn those cases, monopolies can be tolerated, but must be locked down tight. The classic solutions are nationalization (takes away the profit motive, like you hint at in the case of Wikipedia) or regulation (profit motive stays, but there is a watchdog). \n\nWikipedia seems to have found a third solution: openness. If you do not like what Wikipedia is providing, you can look for a different source, but you can also change Wikipedia itself. \n\nThe problem is also mitigated by the fact that, to a first approximation, encyclopedias are not a natural monopoly. Indeed, there is Wikipedia, but there are also specialized sources like Investopedia for finance, etc. \n\nSo, yes, motivation is a big factor, and openness a help.

It doesn't take us much effort, but the total effort is in the price. Pumping crude oil, shipping it to China, making plastics, shipping it back to the EU. Or growing a tree for years on end just to get that small plank you want. The reality is: materials take a **long** time to produce. We are just spoiled.\n\nIn order to be more sustainable, we need more local materials. That involves growing them where we need them.

Between the virus itself and the images flooding social media from the race protests in the US and across the world, everything feels pretty chaotic right now.\n\nWe are in uncharted territory and it feels like we are swimming through vast amounts of information each day. Whether this data is accurate, inaccurate, weaponised, divisive, healing, conciliatory or contradictory, as a society we are feeling at a loss with how to interpret and analyse it.\n\nAt EdgeRyders we have often spoken about the dangers of misinformation but this week we have increasingly questioned our inability to interpret what lies between the accurate and the inaccurate.\n\nHow can, and is, this grey information being shaped into a narrative that perpetuates a cycle of repression, violence and exclusion? Racism exists in the US, it is visible. But how do people react to information that racial transgressions happen closer to home?\n\nThis week we started a conversation to learn who is doing better when it comes to interpreting information and what can we learn from them? One of our members [has asked](https://edgeryders.eu/t/disinformation-strategies-and-tactics/13702) if there are any communities where disinformation is less prevalent and if these models could be used to build a better internet.\n\nWe are also learning to see through the noise. We had a webinar with the research institute DeLab and its data scientists to help interpret the information from a big data project they undertook on Covid 19. Some of the results are really interesting - take a [look here](https://covid.delabapps.eu/) and [feel free to comment](https://edgeryders.eu/t/webinar-making-sense-of-a-covid-19-world-applying-collective-intelligence-to-big-data-3rd-of-june/13537) if you have any thoughts on how to approach the interpretation of data.\n\nWe\u2019ve also been thinking about how we can constructively act on information to help us cope and support one another through challenging situations. Like rebuilding livelihoods in crashing economies which will be a large topic discussed at out \u201cMaking a Living\u201d Summit later this year.\n\nOur first presummit listening session focused on [community-oriented food projects](https://edgeryders.eu/t/after-covid19-while-food-businesses-are-failing-can-community-oriented-food-projects-be-the-way-forward/13409). Our [next session](https://edgeryders.eu/t/session-on-endangered-researchers-and-precarity-in-higher-education/13414) takes place on June 22 and brings together higher education workers and policymakers, human rights defenders and unionists to discuss labour conditions over the past two decades.\n\nFood for thought\n\nOne of our co-founders has created an [amazing visualized representation](https://edgeryders.eu/t/edgeryders-visualized-a-tentative-animation/13751) of EdgeRyders\u2019 story since it was first established eight years ago. You can take a look at the video that shows over 70,000 posts written by our registered platform users.\n\nTake care and have a thoughtful week.\n<br>\n<hr>\n<br>\n\n*Video art: Structure: I Was Always Trying To See You Through The Noise by Karborn*", "created_at": "2020-06-06 09:52:15.303186", "updated_at": "2020-06-21 09:35:29.419442", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 576, "wiki": false, "reads": 21, "score": 449.2, "like_count": 7, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 6400, 4, 5, 347, 3, 2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 64289, "user_id": 5661, "topic_id": 11562, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Thanks!

They all come with et alii of course - who might be the better points of contact. Well and of course Dunbar himself is also still alive and kicking (also in the digital space). \n\nMy hypothesis is that digital social networks are tools for specific ends. These are generally different between to network operators and the network clients. Aligning them (where you want this) will require a close look at incentives, rights, and funding. Transparency is IMO a very critical issue.\nSecond, clients have different goal sets in different circumstances. There are different levels of granularity you can break these down to (and also they aren't likely very rational). \n\nAs a first stab starting from the bottom up I would say that I want to have my tool perform 3 primary functions for me (when I focus on the issue driven networks, which most of the time take the lead for me personally):\n1. Exploration (find out more about my environment and how I can manipulate it to my ends)\n2. Monitoring (optimize for cost/benefit of attention, i.e. I don't want to miss important but rapid developments in my environment, nor do I want to miss tectonic shifts - both of this with a optimal signal to noise ratio)\n3. Getting shit done (the interface needs to support curation, 3rd party curation, curation of the curation. It needs to strike the right balance of staying abreast of work amplification technologies for cognitive, possibly manual, and particularly communication type work - from Gutenberg over PGP, to audio, video conf, dropbox, to onshape CAD, to snapchat, etc.).\n\nSimple, I know. \nAlso: Bravo for your effort!", "created_at": "2019-06-19 14:26:01.130986", "updated_at": "2019-06-19 14:26:01.130986", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 400, "wiki": false, "reads": 31, "score": 11.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 68944, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 10980, "post_number": 7, "raw": "Hi everyone, just a notice that we didn't get it through, so we will have to look elsewhere for this kind of project - it's at the intersection of civic and artistic, tough one!\nOnwards, and ping me if you come across other relevant calls (thanks @alex_stef for sending this one our way <3)!", "created_at": "2020-01-20 09:23:36.359502", "updated_at": "2020-01-20 09:23:36.359502", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 55, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 6.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 66284, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 9881, "post_number": 126, "raw": "We do not yet have chat, but it is a feature we are considering from time to time. @hugi", "created_at": "2019-11-29 08:50:17.545052", "updated_at": "2019-11-29 08:50:34.664336", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 19, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 23.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [66281], "is_liked_by": [5083], "is_private": false}, {"id": 80380, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 14052, "post_number": 7, "raw": "Good question.

Hi and welcome @richdecibels. Maybe you both have come across this post on the political origins of brotherhood in the merchant and craft guilds in Europe: https://blog.p2pfoundation.net/fraternitas-mercatorum/2016/07/27\n\nAs I read you I am thinking about time. How you sustain relationships and manage assets over time.\n\nFirst relationships. At the festival last year one of the @woodbinehealth crew did a session looking at the amount of time you need to put into different kinds of relationships in order for them to remain healthy. He had looked into the different circles of trust/strength of ties (e.g who you feel you can turn to for help with money problems vs people you know by name and have some kind of loose relationship to vs people you recognise and say hi to when at a bar). He has somehow figured out how much time and attention each kind of relationship requires to be sustained. Then  put together a rough equation to help make choices about what to put ones time into inorder to ensure one is embedded in a net of relationships that keeps one healthy, cared for and resilient. \n\nThen assets. A few years ago we looked into how people are stewarding/sustaining the kinds of projects or infrastructure that have direct impact on the quality of every day lives. This report we wrote on more or less distributed networks of crews and individuals stewarding assets at scale in connection with one of the large-ish community events we do (they follow a specific format even through the topic changes): https://www.scribd.com/document/263421647/Can-networked-communities-steward-public-assets-at-scale\n\n@alberto sure re: your question about panels.", "created_at": "2018-12-13 09:24:46.854191", "updated_at": "2018-12-13 09:24:46.854191", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 298, "wiki": false, "reads": 26, "score": 55.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [49363], "is_liked_by": [2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 67017, "user_id": 5597, "topic_id": 12124, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Tunisian Municipalities are facing different challenges ranging from managing their budgets efficiently to maintaining good infrastructure to increasing the quality of public service delivery etc on the one hand. On the other hand, active youth have great ideas that could boost the municipality\u2019s work but there is a communication gap between both of them.\n\nFor this reason, we launched the \u201cMunicipal Innovation for the Community\u201d an open innovation initiative for Tunisian municipalities facing challenges that aims at creating a collaborative problem-solving platform that results in bringing innovations for the improvement of municipal public services delivery and performance.\n\nThe program has three phases:\n\n-1st phase: Municipal Innovation Challenge: A participatory workshop to identify key challenges faced by municipalities with members of the communities.\n\n-2nd phase: Municipal Innovation Camp: An innovative ideas competition that will gather teams composed of municipality staff and members communities to solve key challenges identified through collective intelligence and supported by technology.\n\n-3rd phase: Municipal Action for the Community: Municipalities will be supported to implement solutions and to manage change driven by these solutions.\n\n**Phase 1:**\n\nA workshop to identify the challenges faced by the municipality of El Mourouj took place on November 30th, in its premises. The objective of this workshop was to deliver an opportunity to the municipality\u2019s heads of departments to express their challenges to the participants, to foster communication between them and the city\u2019s citizens and to identify the potential subjects of the Hackathon. A google form was shared a week before with active citizens from El Mourouj and we had 55 subscriptions, divided between students and employees.\n\nAfter welcoming participants who were 22 and the municipality heads of departments who were 6, Mehdi El Batti and I (Ahmed Hadhri) opened the event at 10 am and started presenting the Municipal Innovation Challenge, its objectives, its different phases and talked about the Edgyders Community and its mission. We also talked about the agenda of the event, that we started with an icebreaker to get to know each other. Each participant has to say his/her name and all the names of the people who said their names before him/her. \n\n![EEM_0042|466x690](upload://iZ4hSds0Bdu46Klq5gDb4jnP36c.jpeg) \n\nAfterwards, the facilitator invited each head of a department to the stage to present himself/herself and to talk about the challenges he/she is facing during his work:\n\n-Mr Nader Mechergui: Head of communication and citizen service. He informed participants that the municipality has already an online platform where citizens can submit their complaints or claims without being obliged to move to the municipality but most of them don\u2019t know it (only 400 subscriptions). He said that the municipality is doing many good initiatives and activities but unfortunately, the citizens are not aware of it. On the other hand, he added that they want the citizens to be more active and to help the municipality in the development of their communities...\n\n![%C3%A9tapes%20de%20cr%C3%A9ation%20d'une%20entreprise|476x690](upload://4cBH2b4xRCIrTSQF2YabvzL8jft.jpeg) \n\n\u2022\tMr Nizar Yahyaoui: Head of environmental police. He shared his big frustration about the situation he is in, complaining about the non-collaboration of the police, of the lack of material and human resources (8 agents and one car only for 150 000 citizens), of the non-application of their decisions and of the slowness of judicial procedures.\t\n\n![EEM_0119|690x450](upload://ucmCoZdDyzzwFD4iUA8MaJRFzeU.jpeg) \n\n\u2022\tMrs Souhir Hmaied: Head of green spaces department. She talked about the lack of human resources; she has only 10 employees, 6 of them are disabled persons. She has a problem of job allocation and of employee motivation. \n\n![EEM_0144|690x449](upload://fjha31UCYWvgZnbVjtYfE4MF1kL.jpeg) \n\n\u2022\tMrs Souhir Ganzoui: Head of the technical department. She explained that the municipality doesn\u2019t have a Geographic Information System, so when they start a building site, they don\u2019t have any idea about the changeover plans of STEG, ONAS and TELECOM. This resulted in an itinerary change at many times and consequently in the non-respect of deadlines. Except for STEG who has a non-updated digital underground plan, all the others don\u2019t have one. She also talked about the lack of a system that integrates underground maps with an urban layout plan and subdivision plans.\n\n![EEM_0152|690x432](upload://7Hr352AQIun8EuqopSYXNJEzKJC.jpeg) \n\n\u2022\tMr Ayadi Wannes: Head of the cleanliness department. He talked about the need for vehicle fleet optimisation since the price of spare parts and fuel consumption are high. He said that there is a challenge to ensure the continuity of the service when some employees are absent, that there is a lack of landfill and trash cans. He also added that door-to-door garbage collection is a problem and that some citizens are irresponsible because they throw home appliances with household waste and take out the garbage at any time.\n\n![EEM_0164|690x475](upload://wQJg92kMTm4XZjrLeRFf7SRmehE.jpeg) \n\n\u2022\tMr Mourad Belhajala: Head of financial and Human Resources department. He said that although the budget is significant, he doesn\u2019t have enough employees and that the ones he has need more training. He also added that there is a lack of human resources optimization knowledge from other heads of departments. Finally, he didn\u2019t hide that the recovery rate is very low because people don\u2019t pay taxes.\n\n![EEM_0130|447x690](upload://spxhc6bnJ0nGVmsXJrNTEnZKoVc.jpeg) \n\nIt was planned for each one to have 10 minutes speech and 5 min Q&A but we decided to allocate more time (2 hours and a half in total) when we noticed that they were very open to share and that their interactions with the public were very interesting. \n\n**Afternoon session**\n\nAfter a 45 min lunch break, we started our session at 2 pm with collecting feedbacks regarding the morning session, followed with a funny storytelling energizer. Afterwards, our trainer, Mr Khoubeib Djemai, did a summary of the challenges to the different department heads, before letting participants choose which department they will work on and dispatching them in teams. \n\n![EEM_0283|690x433](upload://l84bkj7ZZPqPZTPKjznU3TeuA7t.jpeg) \n\nEnvironmental police and gardening departments did not interest any participant, however, communication department had the most interest. We had 5 groups representing the following 5 departments: Cleanliness, communication, citizen service, technical and finance. It was a challenge to keep all the heads of departments after lunch but we succeeded to keep the head of the communication department and the head of the cleanliness department.\n\n![team|690x411](upload://7ottNwxyK3yTbBMI6v1lTlsaLSr.jpeg) \n![teamc|690x435](upload://oRprUKJQO50Dm3IyAchYhpMrbt7.jpeg) \n![teamcom|690x435](upload://6kxGS4W0WqhVMP3CXxGSIpRhSxD.jpeg) \n![teamf|690x433](upload://9LGnRVLU9K77tFJ5X65W49VXVEB.jpeg) \n![teamt|690x496](upload://1h8h3Gl1P90wXHWcRA5zSMzeiSR.jpeg) \n\nTheir first task of each team was to discuss the challenges they understood from the heads of departments with each other and to list them while using the *five Whys* tool. Then, we gave them a matrix with which they should prioritize the challenges.\n\nThe next step was to select the most important challenge and to prepare a pitch following the *QQOQCCP* approach by answering the following questions: Who, What, Where, When, How and lastly Why?. Right after, each team had a 3 min pitch followed by 3 min Q&A.\n\nFinally, we closed the event with voting on the most important challenges using the online polling tool mentimeter. The participants used their smartphones to rank the key challenges from the most to the least important one as follows:\n\n1. Lack of effective communication between the municipality and the members of the community ( citizens, CSO\u2026)\n2. The low number of interactions and subscriptions in the virtual citizen space (espace citoyen)\n3. Low level of tax collection and revenue mobilization\n4. Collection of household wastes\n5. Lack of digital underground maps for the different utilities networks (water, sanitation, electricity, gas, telecoms\u2026).\n\n![EEM_0438|690x417](upload://1nCbuVbKQlkdWwDwgA9OZJCSNrQ.jpeg) \n\nThe event ended at 5.30 pm with a group photo and with the distribution of attendance certificates signed by the head of the municipal commission in charge of participatory democracy and open governance.\n\n![EEM_0434-2|690x434](upload://bmemwrkMPuYjY7SF13njSKG7Plr.jpeg) \n\nAn email will be sent to participants with a Google Form to collect their feedbacks and to ask them to share their thoughts and recommendations on the platform.\n\nWe are more motivated than before to continue to the next step given the high level of engagement of the municipality and the members of the community of El Mourouj.\n\nOur sincere thanks to the Edgyders Community for its precious support and to the talented Omar Rezgani for the pictures.\n\n**Feedbacks**\n\nThe representative of the municipal council and the participating heads of services at the municipality of El Mourouj found the experience very rewarding as they had the opportunity to share their challenges with participants in an honest and open way. They also realized that the members of the community are very committed to help the municipality in identifying their key challenges and to move the next phase to work with the municipality staff to innovate and find ICT enabled solutions for their key challenges.

The country's engagement manager should of course be cced (d'oh).\n\nA sample of the email text follows:\n\n=========SAMPLE EMAIL STARTS HERE=========\n\nDear all,\n\nplease find some details about what exactly we will be doing during the mission.\n\n<strong>The purpose of the mission</strong>\n\nMissions on FutureMakers have two goals.\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Connecting with the institutional space around youth in each country. This is in part informational: finding out what is out there in terms of policy, flagship projects and other interesting activities in the areas where young people interacts employment, social inclusion and data. In part it is political: signalling that the new inter-agency, inter-regional programme will\u00a0not\u00a0go over the heads on the people in each country, but \u00a0will want to work with them.</li>\n\n<li>Connecting with grassroots activities \"from the edge\". This is thought to have an impact on resource mobilization: some donors are more likely to fund the programme if it involves \"unusual suspects\". Most of the work here is done online, but we try to create one point of physical contact where UNDP and UNV mingle with grassroots initiatives. We have found this to be highly motivating for the grassroots people. This is why the call to \"bring your own projects\": by giving people visibility to their initiatives, we hope to encourage them to connect with us.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nTaken together, these two goals form a sort of comprehensive view of what's going on in the spaces of employment, social cohesion and data in each of the six countries. So, each mission has two parts. The institutional meetings strive towards goal 1. The in-country workshop serves goal 2.\n\nI have asked Millie for the authorization to send you my inception report, where all this is outlined. And the methodology is explained in greater detail.\n\n<strong>The calendar of the mission</strong>\n\nThe calendar of the mission is as follows:\n\n[example: Morocco] 8 Jun: fly into Casablanca (landing at 20.00)\n\n9, 10, 11 morning Jun: meetings\n\n11 afternoon: small community event?\n\n12 Jun: fly out from Casablanca (13.00).\n\n<strong>The institutional agenda</strong>\u00a0\n\nI trust the CO on this. The notes we took during the call mention the [list of entities and orgs mentioned during the call]\u00a0\n\n<strong>The community meeting</strong>\n\n[making decisions on when and where to hold the community meetings.

It's quite a challenge but we think we can do it together. In this post we discuss the content already submitted and\u00a0</em>\n\nOver the past week I have come across some interesting posts: <a href=\"/t/hello-from-egypt/2540\">Hazem's story</a> about people hacking the motorway in Egypt, Gillikins <a href=\"/t/about-a-blacksmith/2548\">story about a blacksmith</a> in Georgia, the <a href=\"/spot-the-future/turning-young-women-into-hacktivists-in-tbilisi\">biggest hackathon in Europe</a>, <a href=\"/t/change-your-opinion-destroying-gender-stereotypes-in-georgia/2539\">stencils telling women to stay at home</a> or <a href=\"/t/smoke-free-tbilisi-project/2545\">trying to create smoke free environents in the city</a>. And we are just getting started.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ve been thinking about what they say about the current situation on the ground. Both from the perspective of the protagonists and initiatives in the stories told, and from the point of view of others who interact with them. \u00a0\n\nWhich approaches or projects seem most promising and credible to people interacting with them? What obstacles are they coming across and what small steps do they feel could be taken to address them assuming no one else is coming? What obstacles require more state level intervention, or even just peer to peer collaboration on a global scale?\n\nHelping one another to develop a shared understanding and credible answers to these questions is core to this project. Because it is a necessary foundation for collaborating around solutions to our problems.\n\nSo as a first step towards fostering this kind of solutions-oriented discussion, we need to produce a small number of well written articles that present a number of inspiring initiatives in Armenia, Egypt and Georgia. The submitted posts are a good starting point, but I think they need to be developed further.\n\nBecause unlike articles for passive consumption, Spot the Future articles ought to be written in such a way so as encourage readers to actively engage with one another. Each article should end with a call to action for three things:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>Share more stories of interesting initiatives</strong>\u00a0so we can inspire more of the same.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li><strong>Reflect on what obstacles the initiatives face and what could be done to work around them</strong>. Assume that no one else is coming to the rescue and all we have are our minds and bodies to work with.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Reflect on how the initiative relates to one or more of these themes and topics</strong>. What do they say about realistic approaches towards addressing the challenges in your country?</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Where does it all go?</h3>\n\nThe\u00a0<a href=\"/t/spot-the-future-tour-info-pack/2524\">tour of workshops in Armenia, Egypt and Georgia</a> is going to be very heavily based on the insights generated through the discussion sparked by the content of the commissioned articles. The purpose of the workshops is to get people working together in a more hands on way after having interacted online, both with people around the corner as well as with peers who live all over the planet.\n\n<strong>It will also require a lot of work to reach out to people and invite them to participate in this conversation here</strong> on the Edgeryders platform, rather than on Facebook or twitter. \u00a0As far as we are concerned those are just channels to to draw engagement on to this platform: This is a prerequisite for us to be able to set the scene for collaboration between community members in different parts of the world.\u00a0\n\nYes Edgeryders has social media accounts on Facebook and Twitter etc. But we don't have a lot of traction in Armenia, Egypt or Georgia. So we would need you to help get the word out to our peers in the country. So whoever produces the articles and calls to actions will together with<strong> </strong>the online community builder for their country ( [Vahagn] in Armenia, [Inge] in Georgia and t.b.d. in Egypt)\u00a0have to<strong> be active in getting the word out to people in their local environments.</strong>\n\nEach selected article selected for publication on the coming project website will be paid 200USD and the author will be eligible for one of a small number of paid travel grants to the International conference in Georgia at the end of the project.\n\nSo, any idea where we can find pieces of the future to build on together?\n\nDo go ahead and <a href=\"/t/paid-work-opportunities-call-for-articles-about-interesting-initiatives-and-people-in-armenia-egypt-and-georgia/2492\">submit a Spot the Future story</a>\u00a0and encourage others to do the same.\u00a0\n\nVery much looking forward to working together.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-03-24 14:57:49", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:14.673978", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 910, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 10.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4586, "user_id": 2657, "topic_id": 4553, "post_number": 1, "raw": "The second story is about the great young activist, psychologist and youth leader that has a lot of ideas and projects in hold for youth empowerment and activism.

It's goal is to promote fair and active voting on elections, with emphasis on fighting the corruption and bribery during elections of the young electorate in Ukraine. The problem in Ukraine is severe, since during every election there is huge buying of votes among pensioners and young people, not interested in the political process. Starting from EuroMaidan, this situation has changed slightly for better, but other goals were added - such as enlarging youth activism in political activism, making every voting understandable and throughout researched, to make young people more interested in political system formation etc.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Your voice project\n\n<span><span>Throughout \u201cyour voice\u201d project there were 2 campaigns - the presidential elections (motivating young people to vote and elect a candidate sensibly) and parliamentary elections: be active, vote and do not sell their votes</span></span>\n\n<span><span>The initiative was launched on April 2015 with the help of Euromaidan activists.

The \"Your Voice\" is intended to lay the foundation of the election culture which is education and mobilization campaign created to answer the question: why should we vote, why every vote is important and how can you protect it. The project will help young people to become more familiar with the nature and technology of the election process and learn how to make critical and rational choice in political preferences and not be afraid to defend their vote. In addition it will show that their votes count, and it will motivate them for more activism</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<div>Alexander has already registered on the platform and is putting on his case.

The documentaries that were shown was quite intriguing one. And over all this day is reminding me more of the recent aftermath only of a month ago or so and that I have yet to overcome.\n\nWell that saying or lets just say the thinking of it strike me, not for the super hypothetical theory of a machine he talked about, but how that it can never be achieved. He informed that there was a machine to predict the disaster about 20 seconds earlier, so to make a more advance machine would realistically take years and years. But we, with the shocked mentality can't think of waiting for something that may even not be possible.\n\nSo what I think I like preparing the people, the youths, the students. By giving them a compulsory training sort of, for emergency times. Like giving the scout trainings to every student in every schools. And giving them more knowledge about risks and disasters and how to act irrationally during those time, and with leadership skills as to control not only themselves but all the society.\n\nBecause we cannot predict the disaster, our enemy is an uninvited one. But it has enough power to alter everything we stand for. With that earthquake experience, we can agree on that. And how we panic, may be one person don't, or two can control themselves. But its like a flock of sheep running wild. I have seen that, and you have too. So we don't know when it strikes, but we can mitigate it with early session preparation\n\nSo like the scout training to students, we can give further trainings of first aid, basic sanitization and many other things. It's like educating people, not just with the books and stuffs, but with the facts they will need when handling a disaster.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-20 11:43:42", "updated_at": "2017-08-28 17:40:36.099334", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 355, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 15.4, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 2554, 2560], "is_private": false}, {"id": 68906, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 12428, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Yes sure after monday", "created_at": "2020-01-19 06:03:59.427121", "updated_at": "2020-01-19 06:03:59.427121", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 22.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4096], "is_private": false}, {"id": 58652, "user_id": 5123, "topic_id": 10600, "post_number": 17, "raw": "Jak festiwal to festiwal!

I personally pushed quite hard to convince her to make space in her schedule. And the reason is this: she is the CEO of [EIT Climate-KIC](https://www.climate-kic.org/who-we-are/what-is-climate-kic/), Europe\u2019s leading climate innovation initiative, *and she actually leads it as if the house were on fire, and we were out of time*.  This should be the norm of our instititutions, but it is not, not at all. In the spring I attended C-KIC's retreat, and I was very impressed: finally, some sanity in somebody in a position of power! \n\nKirsten is, however, relatively new to her organization. EIT Climate-KIC was designed by others, with different priorities and in a different situation. To achieve her goals, she needs a very effective, even charismatic leadership. That makes her ideal for leading the Lab, which is full of very smart and opinionated people and risks ending up being a bit chaotic. You can get an idea of her style from [this video interview](https://youtu.be/OJj_FFTgFgg).\n\n**october 29**\n\nThe keynote lecture with Cory Doctorow and Kirsten Dunlop is going to be great, but in the end the Sci-Fi Economics Lab aims to produce some new economics. We aim to stimulate the production and publication of new economic thinking. We would like to start with a \"blue sky\" seminar, inspired by the keynote lecture itself: its main aim is to connect people who are already thinking outside the box, and plan some papers that we could write together. I say \"we\" because I plan to take part in this myself.\n\nThree important things: \n\n* This will be a small meeting, 10-12 people at most, but...\n* ... if you want to participate, but you are not in Brussels, you still can. We will attempt to connect you with co-authors, and follow-up. \n* We know science fiction tends to be a male genre, but we still want to encourage female SF authors (or just readers), economists and scholars of any science to participate. We know you are out there, ladies, and we want you to know you are always welcome with us.\n\nTo find out how to join this part of the lab, read our [call for co-authors](https://scifieconomicslab.net/call/).\n\n### october 30: Invited remarks\n\nWe have had several important thinkers expressing interest in the Sci-Fi Economics Lab, and asking \"how can I participate?\". The Lab's maiden voyage is just a prototype edition, and we do not have a large programme in which to give space to everybody. So, instead we have decided to add a section to our keynote event, which I call \"invited remarks\". We are inviting some of these people to share a short reflection on what they are doing, and why it could be part of the Lab's future work. For now, these people are: \n\n* [Michel Bauwens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Bauwens) on commons-based peer production as an economic engine. It makes a lot of economic sense, why is it not happening more? \n* [Rob van Kranenburg](https://www.theinternetofthings.eu/rob-van-kranenburg) on the economic consequences of the Internet of Things and digital identity. Dystopia? Utopia? Both? \n* [Giuseppe Porcaro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Porcaro) on science fiction and institutions. Is the future of the EU to be *Star Trek* 's Federation? Or Bruce Sterling's Aquis? Or William Gibson's Kleptocracy?\n* [Filippo Barbera](https://www.didattica-cps.unito.it/do/docenti.pl/Alias?filippo.barbera#profilo) on  the future of regional economies. Can we imagine them in a world in climate crisis? \n\nEach remark will last three minutes, and the keynote speakers will be asked to comment on them. \n\n### No date for now: what actually happens on the 11th of November?\n\nThe countdown to the Sci-FI Economics Lab continues, so it's a good time to look into what actually happens on the 11th of November.\n\n* At 14.30, at [Kano](https://www.kano.brussels/), the seminar [Reclaiming Utopia](https://www.thephoenixproject.site/reclaimingutopia/), led by Julyan and Davey from Extinction Rebellion London. We will learn how to mobilize ourselves to become climate activists. \n* At 18.00, at [lesrichesclaires](https://lesrichesclaires.be/), a double keynote with author Cory Doctorow and professor Tom Bauler (**tbc** \u2013 Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles), with Kirsten Dunlop as MC. This is going to be quite rich, so see below. \n\n* After 20.00, at [La Tricoterie](https://www.tricoterie.be/), we will have a party, with an open stage/mic. \n \nThe double keynote works like this: \n\n* **Lecture by Cory Doctorow** (about 45 minutes) on the world of *Walkaway* . \n* **Counter-lecture by Tom Bauler** (about 45 minutes), looking at the world of *Walkaway* and other fictional economies from the standpoint of a professional economist. What, in that fictional economies (or others that you might like) is old news for economists? What has been tried, but did not work? What is profoundly alien to academic economists? \n* **Invited remarks**: 3 minutes remarks by each of 4-6 invited people, which Doctorow and Bauler will then be invited to comment (about 45 minutes). The provisional list of people offering them is:\n   * [Kirsten Dunlop](https://www.climate-kic.org/who-we-are/executive-board/): on how climate change forces a new economy on us. Will we need to fast-deploy one, like in the 20th century's war economies?\n   * [Michel Bauwens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Bauwens) on commons-based peer production as an economic engine. It makes a lot of economic sense, why is it not happening more?\n  * [Rob van Kranenburg](https://www.theinternetofthings.eu/rob-van-kranenburg) on the  economic consequences of the Internet of Things and digital identity. Dystopia? Utopia? Both?\n  * [Giuseppe Porcaro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Porcaro) on science fiction and institutions. Is the future of the EU to be *Star Trek* 's Federation? Or Bruce Sterling\u2019s Aquis? Or William Gibson\u2019s Kleptocracy?\n  * [Filippo Barbera](https://www.didattica-cps.unito.it/do/docenti.pl/Alias?filippo.barbera#profilo) on the future of regional economies. Can we imagine them in a world in climate crisis?\n* Q&A from the public and closing. \n\nMC of the whole thing is **Kirsten Dunlop**, CEO of EIT Climate-KIC. \n\n\n\n\n### october 31: What if I cannot make it to Brussels?\n\nPeople have gotten in touch with us from all over the world. They love the event, but they cannot make it to Brussels. What now? \n\nFear not. There are two ways in which you can still participate. \n\nThe first: you can watch the live streaming of the keynote event with Cory Doctorow, Tom Bauler, Kirsten Dunlop, and the participation of other economists, authors and thinkers such as Michel Bauwens, Giuseppe Porcaro, Rob van Kranenburg, FIlippo Barbera. \n\nTo get access  to live streaming, [head to our crowdfunding campaign](https://bit.ly/ScifiEconLab) and purchase the 15 EUR perk. You will receive a live streaming url.\n \nThe second: you can join the lab as a possible co-author. We would like to encourage the production and publication of new research on fictional economies: this is mostly a work for 2020, but we will do some brainstorming in 2019, both in Brussels and online. For more information, [read our call for co-authors](https://scifieconomicslab.net/call).\n\n### november 1: New perk: a tea with Cory! \n\n#### Version for everyone\n\nDiehard sci-fi fans are going to love this: while we wait for the keynote event of the Science Fiction Economics Lab, we are organizing a tea break with our keynote speaker, the mighty Cory Doctorow. It will be a chance for a more informal, intimate exchange between us Sci-Fi Econ Lab Rats and him. \n\nAre you coming, too?

We keep watching it over and over again, and every time we find some new thoughts in it. \n\nPersonally, my highlights are when he nails down the contribution of science fiction to a new economic science, at 4'24: \n\n> \"Science fiction can give you a kind of architect's rendering [...] of the emotional lived experience of a better future...\"\n\nThen points out that, while economies are indeed complex systems, we can in principle still navigate and even steer them, through smart communities and collective intelligence, at 5'14:\n\n> \"Although the terrain is unknowable, and although it is too complex for us to ever map a path from A to Z, the terrain can still be traversed, by wayfinding as we go, with people of good will around us.\"\n\nAnd finally when he outlines how our current economic model is _really_ not helping when it comes to radical reform to protect the planet and its people, at 8'30:\n\n>\"These kinds of things [like the Lab], they don't have a big financial constituency. The business model for saving the planet is that the planet gets saved, and we all get to live a better future.

We then follow up and continue online.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<strong>We know this process works.</strong>\u00a0It\u2019s how we have gotten projects like the unMonastery, and Economy App off the ground in less than two years in spite of most of us having very little money.\n\n<strong>Who it is for:</strong>\u00a0Anyone passionate about their project.

By meeting another on the Edgeryders platform and presenting our projects in advance, the physical workshop will be more generative for participants. We think this good for everyone and inspire and energise new collaborations between participants.\n\n<a id=\"outcomes\" name=\"outcomes\"><strong>A generative workshop would result in the following outcomes:\u00a0</strong></a>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>get participants excited about sharing their personal stories and interacting with others in a context of trust and peer support -&gt; both during the event and after it, online</li>\n\n<li>map where appropriate kinds of resources can be found if needed -&gt; who can act as a local community builder and host subsequent events or spread the word about Spot the Future, what initiatives generate most enthusiasm and support from the others in the room \u00a0</li>\n\n<li>inspire the people in attendance (both physically and through social media) to engage more people who are NOT in attendance.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>acknowledge future-building initiatives and encourage an ethics of rewarding the doers. This should make it more sustainable to engage in effective actions in one\u2019s local community.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>mutual , peer to peer support around one anothers projects, and collaborations with people all over the world.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h1><a id=\"howtogetinvolved\" name=\"howtogetinvolved\">HOW TO GET INVOLVED</a></h1>\n\n<strong>How can community members in Armenia, Egypt and Georgia work with those of us not on location</strong>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Participate in the\u00a0<a href=\"/t/agora/286/community-call-onboarding-new-edgeryders\">W</a><a href=\"/t/weekly-community-call-come-say-hi-and-meet-other-edgeryders/2689\">EEKLY COMMUNITY CALLS</a>\u00a0for a shared understanding of the project development.</li>\n\n<li>Assist us with planning of the Tour:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Build partnerships with local organisations to co-host the event</strong>\u00a0(local hackerspaces e.g.), produce material for sharing via email, Facebook and Twitter inviting participants into the tour workshops.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Produce material for Edgeryders Spot The Future would tour minisite/page</strong>\u00a0</li>\n\n<li><strong>Produce digital flyers for sharing</strong>, coordinate (last minute) email and phone communication with participants.</li>\n\n</ul></li>\n\n<li><strong>Work closely with other participants to craft and spread the news about the project among underground groups</strong>, welcome participants on the platform and re-share links.

As well as how we can support one another. By the time we have completed all 5 phases we will be well on the way to collaborating with new friends all over the world and ready to meet in person at one of the workshops in Armenia, Egypt and Georgia! \u00a0Those who take the journey through all five phases will come together for the big Spot The Future international event in June. It will be a chance to compare notes, hatch plans and meet some 50 new friends from across the globe. \u00a0\n\n<h4>There's two ways you can come to the big Spot The Future event in June</h4>\n\n<strong>Sign up to Edgeryders, share your ryde below and book a flight or train to Tblisi for June 25-27</strong>. Email spfevent@edgeryders.eu before May 1 to let us know you're coming. We'll send you a ticket and practical information about the hows, whens and wheres as we come closer to the date.

Active youth participation can not only help for ease in reconstruction process but can also cease the slow pace of development and help us to achieve a more rapid and long-term sustainable development.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-20 13:37:00", "updated_at": "2017-09-10 19:47:35.535650", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 137, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 20.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 52586, "user_id": 4384, "topic_id": 9731, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Like the system in plants the project is named after, phloem will help control the transfer and storage of energy.

I believe I understand something of a theory that amateur radio operators can provide assistance to disaster relief organizations. I've read of the work of Team Rubicon in disaster relief, also. Perhaps it may be a kind of a technical topic, in a sense.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn a context of the earthquake in Nepal, the ARRL - the US national association for amateur radio - in an institutional sense, the ARRL being a principal authority about amateur radio activity in the US - the ARRL has commented about the work of amateur radio operators, in assisting in the response to the Nepal quake.[1] The Amateur Radio Society of India (ARSI) is credited as providing assistsnce, in the relief effort, along with the US Military Auxiliary Radio Service (MARS). ARSI itself publishes an article,\u00a0<em>Ham Radio In Emergencies\u00a0</em>[2]\n\nI understand that the licensing requirements are extensive, for civil, non-commercial radio operations, in India as well as in the US and elsewhere. Personally, I've begun to study about the US FCC's Technican Class of amateur radio license - an informative endeavor, though candidly, I wonder if I may seem to be overmuch of a \"Rogue Scholar\" for the culture of amateur radio in the US. Along with the licensing requirements, of course there are the material qualities of radio ownership, radio maintenance, and radio operation on amateur radio networks. Perhaps it could seem obscured, in ways, juxtaposed to the novelty of consumer-grade GSM and CDMA networks for digital communications on the Internet. Amateur radio networks, of course, may function independent of public Internet infrastructure.\n\nI believe there can be a broader understanding developed about amateur radio communications. I wonder if it may be adopted as a topic, here at Edgeryders?\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n[1] ARRL.\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.arrl.org/news/amateur-radio-volunteers-in-nepal-india-continue-to-aid-earthquake-response\"><em>Amateur Radio Volunteers in Nepal, India Continue to Aid Earthquake Response</em></a>\n\n[2] ARSI.\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.arsi.info/ham-radio-in-emergencies\"><em style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 19.2px; line-height: 32.64px;\">Ham Radio In Emergencies</em></a>\n\n", "created_at": "2015-11-13 21:24:35", "updated_at": "2017-09-15 20:31:37.634738", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 467, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 35.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 66356, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 11940, "post_number": 8, "raw": "So in terms of positive disintegration, spending time online viewing certain things is a form of self-mutilation..?", "created_at": "2019-11-29 17:49:01.162990", "updated_at": "2019-11-29 17:49:01.162990", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 18, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 21.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [66283], "is_liked_by": [5083], "is_private": false}, {"id": 54530, "user_id": 4986, "topic_id": 10064, "post_number": 24, "raw": "4PM CET this Thursday works for me!", "created_at": "2019-06-04 14:22:11.593919", "updated_at": "2019-06-04 14:22:11.593919", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 7, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 27.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [54510], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 67495, "user_id": 4861, "topic_id": 11476, "post_number": 14, "raw": "[quote=\"gustav, post:13, topic:11476\"]\n> > Copyright 2019 Gustav Larsson, released under the GPLv3+ which is included in the file LICENSE in the git repository\n\nMakes sense!\n\nIs it possible to write this in a non-personal way? Or is it better to just keep adding names to this for new contributors?\n[/quote]\n\nIts tricky. **Afaiu giving away the Copyright of ones own works has to be done rather explicit in most legislativesn and situation**, i.e. you would need some kind of contract or written proof that the contributor consciously \"donates\" the otherwise exclusive copy-rights to you. In the case of a single author, stating the copyright in the README or the published file should be enough though.\nI've seen this being handled in multiple fashions and I am not an expert in this, so take it with a grain of salt; and as stated I think the situations would be judged quite different in the courts of different countries.\n\nAnyway, **multiple copyright holders should only become an issue if the code is to be relicensed** - e.g. suddenly a client wants to have some changes that shouldnt be made public for whatever reason or suddenly a different license makes more sense. Traditionally as sole copyright owner you would hand the client a copy under a proprietary license. In the case of multiple copyright-holders you would have to get permission by each copyright owner to copy his/her contributed code under different license terms (as long as you respect the original license terms you are of course okay).\n\nFor (not only business-)practical reasons **it can be desirable to choose a single copyright holder** (e.g. you, or edgeryders). Actually there are also foundations, NGOs and Charities founded just to hold copyright and/or act as fiscal host for software projects.\n\nI've signed digital Contributor Agreements of companies owning GPL'ed code, other (most) projects seem to assume that a license change might not be necessary or that contributors agree to transfer the copyright of their changes to the entity which is mentioned e.g. in the README.\n\nI think if I were a company like edgeryders, I would ask the copyright to be transferred to me (the company), find out and care about what happens if the company should ever cease to exist and require a single file in the git repository where every contributor is asked to put his/her name with the intention to transfer the copyright (although this might not be 100% legally binding in every legislation I think that it would make a good enough argument, especially when linked to a discussion / company manual regarding the implications). Btw I think if you are paid to deliver code usually the client owns the copyright afterwards.\n\nNow that I have written all that, I just did a quick internet search and immediately found two articles whose authors obviously spent more time in writing their texts :) https://haacked.com/archive/2006/01/26/WhoOwnstheCopyrightforAnOpenSourceProject.aspx/ , https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/886/copyright-and-contributing-to-an-open-source-project , ...\n\n@hugi @matthias Some more formal process and guidelines (e.g. when contracting IT work, explicitely mention Copyright and propose a preferred License) could go into the Tech Strategy or Company Document.", "created_at": "2019-12-13 20:13:37.871819", "updated_at": "2019-12-13 20:13:37.871819", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 547, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 37.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [67492], "is_reply_to": [67492], "is_liked_by": [4667], "is_private": false}, {"id": 70269, "user_id": 5209, "topic_id": 12646, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Politico Ai - the great mailingbrief Janosh Delcker puts together every week also has a copy of another leaked draft:\n\nhttps://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SKM_C45820012915530.pdf?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&utm_campaign=de44d110fb-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_01_29_03_57&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_10959edeb5-de44d110fb-189775021&utm_source=POLITICO.EU&utm_campaign=d06d564a62-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_02_12_09_59&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_10959edeb5-d06d564a62-189810653", "created_at": "2020-02-14 08:48:03.388644", "updated_at": "2020-02-14 08:48:03.388644", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 54, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 51.6, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 2915, 1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30236, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4660, "post_number": 19, "raw": "<b>Project timeline</b>\n\nWe should have made this clearer, apologies.

How do we make sure that we have the fundamentals in place to stay healthy or even alive when crisis hits?

In order to ensure a high quality discussion - we expect participants to have read and commented on at least 3 of the featured stories so that we know that people have some common foundation for a meaningful conversation.\n\nTogether participants will identify strategies for what can be done depending on different scenarios: 1) The central State is reliable partner or not 2) Which sector we are in (private, public, third, other) 3) Whether we or not we can rely on cohesion and solidarity in in the situation 4) If we are talking about majority society or minorities. We will end it with a webinar during which we present the findings, as well as proposals for possible collaborations and partnerships between participating individuals and organisations who have participated in the process.\n\nCloser to the date of the event, we will publish a list specially invited people who confirmed their attendance, but this is not a panel.

However, this will happen through writeups by people in Edgeryders. While we will record the event, participants are welcome to sign up under aliases and keep their video shut off. Also the writeups will not mention any names. \n\n---\n\n### Preparation & Follow up\n\n#### Before the listening session\n\nDiscover, discuss and make sense of case stories. We (Edgeryders) knew years ago that healthcare systems all over the world were ill positioned to handle a massive crisis. Together with The City of Milan, The University of Bordeaux, the Institute for Economic and Business History Research in Stockholm, WeMake, and the Scimpulse Foundation m research project we ran a project called OpenCare. Over 2 years we interviewed individuals and groups all over the world who are mobilising to care for people where state and market were failing to do so.\n\nhttps://player.vimeo.com/video/162811723\n\nWe now have a huge repository of stories and examples that we can learn from. These are first hand stories by the protagonists themselves - many of whom are on the edgeryders community platform and can be reached to answer questions, provide additional input or possibly even be engaged in new initiatives. The curated collection of summaries will be released on a dedicated blog.\n\n</Text>\n\n</Content>\n\n<Content id=\"Partner\">\n\n## How to partner with this event\n\n<Text>\n\n* This actitvity can be nested within other events/ co-event (own registration from)\n* what we want from partners: Visibility/Reach/Content/Funding\u2026 (Alignment)\n* We are good at the interesting, timely discussions - but struggle to build a good interface with organisations at the centre whose support we need to affect change.\n\nIf you want to help, you have two options\n\n1.

In practice, though, it means that when you select someone else's code, the annotation automatically falls under their code, and it becomes difficult to check that you meant the same thing as them.\n* **Long-term solution**: create colour-coded differentiation between ethnographers in the same project, so you can see whose code you are selecting in the drop-down. \n* **Short-term solution**: revert to your own coding view and use the same backend merge process as you did before. In order to do this, though, we need to be able to group together @Jan and @Wojt as one group who can see each others' codes, and @Jirka_Kocian and @SZdenek. I do have a question though that has only come to me now -- in theory, since you're coding in Polish, when would you be selecting the English code from the dropdown? By default you should only really see the other Polish codes, so this shouldn't be an issue...      \n\n\n @alberto, the next one should interest you as it it a methodological SSNA question.  \n\nWe were discussing how to to tell the difference between proximate and distant co-occurrences (my terminology). A **proximate** co-occurrence is one that exists in the same sentence or paragraph, that the informant explicitly connects. The example we discussed: \"The healthcare system in Poland is low quality.\" The co-occurrence between `healthcare system` and `low quality` there is proximate. A **distant** co-occurrence happens when a community member mentions the healthcare system in one part of their post, and mentions low quality later in the post. We were then trying to think of ways that we could determine the difference between these two.\n\n* For my first answer, I put my @alberto hat on --- if the two concepts reliably co-occur across many posts and comments, then they could be interpreted as proximate regardless, because the increase in number of co-occurrences indicates that these are consistently being tied together by multiple community members, reducing the likelihood of this happening incidentally.\n\n* Anthropologically speaking, this works for co-occurrences but leaves us with the question of capturing the underlying annotations, which @Jan values (wanting to be able to generate a list of annotations where the two concepts co-occur). There are two options for solving this. \n1. If you feel strongly about capturing an annotation list of annotations where both concepts co-occur, create a compound code (`low-quality healthcare`), but also apply the two separate codes as well. This way you have the annotation list in the backend under the compound code. This is also a **short term** solution to this problem as it doesn't require any changes to OE. \n2.  My preferred solution - give the ability to generate a co-occurrence annotation list of all the annotations where two codes co-occur and/or where either of two codes occurs, but in the same post (so both intersection and union). This requires fixing two things: 1. not being able to assign multiple codes to a single highlighted text in one go (this has been a problem since the beginning and we really, really need to fix it). Even re-highlighting is very imprecise and often doesn't work well. 2. Creating a way of generating this list. \n\nNumber 2 would also allow us to do a little \"false co-occurrence\" test, testing whether the first proposition is correct (that frequency will smooth over false links). An example of an annotation that would show us the link is false -- a post where the community member discusses a great experience with Polish healthcare in the top of the post, but later on in the post discusses how low-quality cars in Poland are. \n\nIt is worth noting that we leave room for some flexible interpretation here, because people make implicit connections between what might initially look like **distant** connections, and we want to leave room for novelty --- to be surprised that cars and healthcare are often mentioned in the same post, should that be the case. \n\nThe last fix we propose for this is to be able to indicate breaks in posts that make the system view them as separate contributions, if we see that the post is really two different conceptual worlds that are unconnected to each other. (This would also solve @MariaEuler and @johncoate 's problem with long interview transcriptions). I think this would be well worth creating.   \n\nFinally, we discussed parent-child relations and decided that we need to be able to give a single code two parents.\n\n* **short-term**: before each instance of the SSNA is generated, duplicate the code and nest one under a different parent. Merge after the SSNA is created, then copy again in the next SSNA generation. This is relevant especially if we need to assign all annotations of the child to the parent.\n\n* **long-term**: allow multiple parents for one child.\n\nIn short -- we need a Masters of Networks ASAP!

Kia ora! It's great to be acquainted with this community. I feel it's only fair that I make a mark of my existence here, particularly since I'm nomadic and experiencing a lot of disruption in my personal world. Finding this community feels like I have a chance to base myself somewhere digital, while the learning and the working that I'm called to enact reveals opportunities one by one.\n\nI come from New Zealand and am European politically through my deceased Dutch grandad. Currently I'm based in Stockholm and doing remote Social Permaculture work in India.\n\nI am calling to collaborate, and to meet collaborators.\n\n**What skills do I bring to the picnic?**\nSince I've prioritised authenticity over image for the majority of my adult life, my knowledge is generalist, varied and mostly experiential - I haven't completed any formal higher education and I haven't felt called to coding. Yet since falling into networks of 'change-makers' (of which I regard this community as the berries on the bush), I've found a few key roles valued by academics, social entrepreneurs and designers, which I can offer; facilitation, connection and storytelling.\n\nI have hosted events, parties, cafes, tea ceremonies and most notably a co-working, co-created experimental space in the city where I'm from (Homies Cosy Teahouse, in Wellington). \nBy working in hospitality for 7 years I have discovered this crucial point of transformation between our food distribution systems and our sense of culture, community, self and belonging. I tapped into this curiosity by taking a PDC in 2016 and have since been studying and practicing permaculture. I love the tools in permaculture but I also know that it's not everything, so I have started to dip into holacracy, sociocracy, agile design, responsive org, Teal and every other relevant socio-ecological work that I can find.\n\n**I want to weave opportunities for empowerment.**\nFollowing what I have come to realise about distribution of power, education, healthcare, food, technology and natural resources (I know you know it so I won't elaborate), I'm now driven toward a project which enables grassroots action effectively through hijacking the model of startup incubators. Along the way I hope to demonstrate the potentials for homegrown and local food, medicine and energy, to bring a global sense of alliance and attention to local heroes and to cultivate mindfulness in the communities that I connect to as I move around the planet. \nMore generally, I want to open gateways between the local and global divide and I see food and community as the keystones to my part in this play.\n\n**What am I doing on Edgeryders?**\nThe future is not something anyone should build alone. I'm here to meet you all, to engage with your projects and to find co-conspirators for mine. I'm here to lend, learn, build and share. Currently in the beginning stages of my project, I am researching deeply as see this network as somewhat of a key study in demonstrating the relevance and effectiveness of the network that I'm weaving. That means that I want to be here when it's messy, when it's loud, when it's dull, when it's quiet. And I want to see how I can be of use to the collective.\n\nI trust this gives some idea of the person behind the avatar, when you see me around the forums giving winks and nudges. Give me a bell if anything here resonates with you and freely ask any questions or favours. \n\nLove in advance, \n\nNaomi", "created_at": "2018-04-09 16:42:55.821080", "updated_at": "2018-04-09 16:42:55.821080", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 604, "wiki": false, "reads": 32, "score": 378.4, "like_count": 9, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4357, 8, 4, 5, 4265, 4085, 2915, 1935, 3703], "is_private": false}, {"id": 41973, "user_id": 3904, "topic_id": 8046, "post_number": 12, "raw": "G\u00e9nial @thouzam on va te garder en courant :blush:", "created_at": "2018-02-20 16:26:51.976049", "updated_at": "2018-02-20 16:26:51.976049", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 9, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 22.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [41689], "is_liked_by": [3703], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14566, "user_id": 1504, "topic_id": 2024, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>What should I do to prepare </b>\n\n@noemi @Ben what should I do to prepare for this?", "created_at": "2013-10-09 01:50:47", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:22.208706", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 18, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 65104, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 11505, "post_number": 12, "raw": "ciao - in an hour? pm ing you my number", "created_at": "2019-11-22 09:39:43.938112", "updated_at": "2019-11-22 09:39:43.938112", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 9, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 6.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [65099], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 37610, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 7221, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Remember we have 2 projectors and 2 portable projector screens!", "created_at": "2017-10-05 14:24:10.911347", "updated_at": "2017-10-05 14:24:10.911347", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 10, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 12.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [37318], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 51576, "user_id": 4288, "topic_id": 9602, "post_number": 1, "raw": "I work internationally on a wide range of cultural projects in the areas of cultural policy and strategy, organisational development, festivals and events, issues related to cultural resilience, innovation, cultural rights and the cultural development of cities.

In this post I will not try to break all of it down; rather, I want to reflect on the approach to co-housing proposed by [Wooncoop](https://www.wooncoop.be/), based on the presentation that Luc gave at the workshop ([slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1UwEXSki2i-qXMmLYlr_zTrlZZoiwl1HO), need access to The Reef's shared drive). \n\n## Background: co-housing vs. co-living\n\nIn the governance breakout session, Matthew (is he on the platform, @noemi?) gave us a very useful analytical point: distinguishing co-living from co-housing.\n\n* **co-living** is based on an operator, that manages the building, and a bunch of tenants, that live there. Some operators lease the buildings (eg: [Gravity](https://www.gravitycoliving.com/)); others own them (eg: Co-House); others still even develop them. In all cases, however, people rent the space from the operator, and they tend to get an inclusive service (rent, utilities, maintenance, cleaning, laundry...). Co-living, therefore, tends to be based on convenience, and there tends to be an inverse relationship between convenience and community. People live in the spaces, but everyone is in their own journey, not really owning the space as a common project. Turnover tends to be high. \n* **co-housing** is based on ownership. People buy a living unit which is part of a larger context; sometimes they even develop it together. In Edgeryders, we have been [in conversation with co-housing pioneers](/t/1319) for many years. Community spirit is strong in co-housing projects; the down side is that they tend to support fairly standard middle-class lifestyles. This is driven by liquidity considerations: buying into a co-housing projects in a modern city is very expensive (think 300-500K), far and away the biggest expense in the life of most of us. When you sink that much money into something, you want to make sure you have a robust secondary market in case you decide to cash out and move onto another city. Most people who will spend that much money for a place to live are fairly standard middle-class people people, who want a fairly standard middle-class lifestyle, so the spaces are built for \"the housing market\" instead of for the people who are going to live there in the first place. \n\n## The Wooncoop model\n\nWooncoop, a housing cooperative based in Gent, proposes a model that is neither co-living nor co-housing. As I understand it, it works like this:\n\n1. A group of people decide to go live together. \n2. They engage Wooncoop, and become themselves cooperators. This unlocks access to all of the governance mechanisms of cooperatives under Belgian law. Buying three shares of the cooperative (3 x 250 EUR) each is mandatory for those who also want to live in a Wooncoop project. \n3. A suitable building is found, or developed. The group needs to contribute for at least one third of the cost of purchase/development. The remaining amount is split into two: in an ideal situation, about half is funded by a standard bank loan (presumably against a mortgage), and the remaining half is funded by an investment of Wooncoop itself. WC has many members who are not living in WC projects, but simply invest in it because it has an attractive mix of guaranteed returns (2%) and solid assets (brick and mortar) backing the investments. In practice, at the moment banks contribute for more than one third.\n4. People in the group are given units in the building to live in. They do not own these units, but they do have the right to live in a Wooncoop building. They need to pay rent, but:\n    * The rent reflects \"the pure cost of the building\" (see below, this was contradicted by other elements in the presentation).\n   * People can lower their rent by investing in the project beyond the minimum 750 EUR. Their rent will be lowered by 4% of the amount invested. In no case the rent can be lowered to less than 50% of the full amount. If people invest beyond the amount that lowers their rent by 50%, their rent no longer goes down, but they receive the standard 2% return on the extra amount.\n   * People can ask to move around, from one space to another, depending on the life cycle phase (for example: you marry and get kids, move to a larger space; your kids leave the nest, move to a smaller one, etc.). Also, WC reserves the right to forcibly relocate people who end up with \"more space than they need\". The principle is that no one should have more private bedrooms than people. However, communal extra rooms are possible. This is mostly a goal for now; WC estimates that they can act as a complete, self-contained system when they manage to get 1,000 units (now they have 10 projects, hoping to have 20 by the end of 2020). \n\n5. Cashing out is possible, but not guaranteed. If you want to move, you can try to sell your shares to someone else, or sell it back to Wooncoop (this process is tightly regulated by law. At the beginning of each year, the board allocates a sum for shares buyback, and cooperators who want to cash out apply and are processed as a first come-first served basis), but no one has any obligation to buy from you. On the other hand, as long as WC is standing, any capital that you have in  it is remunerated at 2%, whether you live in it or not. Again, this is mostly theoretical for now, as WC is only two years old, maybe only one person is doing it next year. \n\n## Is Wooncoop a good fit for The Reef?\n\nThere some parts of the WC model that I *really* like:\n\n* **Neither buy nor rent**. You don't own the house (too expensive anyway), but neither do you throw away money in rent, because, like WC likes to say, \"you pay rent to yourself\". You own the coop, which owns the building.\n* **Small investments are possible and remunerative**. Buying a home in Brussels will cost you several hundred thousands; if you only have smaller sums, you need to go for financial assets (funds etc.), and pay rent in the mean time. But with this model, you can put even 10K in your home, and it will immediately decrease your rent, which is the same thing as giving you a financial return. A 30K investment will result in a decrease in rent of 0,04x 30,000 = 1,200 EUR/year, or 100 EUR/month. \n* **No need for an extra corporate vehicle**. WC is already a coop, and it has at least some standing in the Belgian real estate scene. Using it would save a lot of overhead.\n\nBut I also have some doubts:\n\n* **Cashing out is problematic** (see item 5 above). In fairness, this is true of all forms of investment in \"strange\" spaces like The Reef.\n* **The model is predicated on zero interest rates**, which are a historical anomaly. A 2% rate of return is attractive now, with saving accounts yielding 0% interest. But what would happen if interest rates were to go back to 2010 levels, 2%? Likely, it would be harder for WC to find cooperant-investors. This would mean for them resorting more to bank loans, and would threaten the viability of the model. When I asked Luc, he pointed out that macroeconomic indicators point to a continued period of near-zero interest rates, and that in 25 years \"WC will be completely independent from bank credit\". \n* **The model is designed for pure housing, not hybrid live-work spaces**. Conversely, it is not clear what the role of businesses like Edgeryders could be. Could a company be a cooperant too? How comfortable is WC with hybrid spaces like The Reef, part residential and part commercial?\n* **No obvious role for largish investments**. WC does not like to have large investors, because they would break the cooperative were they to cash out with a million EUR. Imagining Edgeryders could bring substantial investments in greening the building, how would that work? Would it have to be given to WC, and used to lower the cost of the project? \n* **Project security**. WC sees all its projects as part of the larger WC system, so much so that Reeflings would acquire, for life, the right to live in one WC unit, *but not necessarily in The Reef*. This is clearly a weakness from our side; and WC itself will probably see their own side of the issue, namely that The Reef might not be attractive for their members who just want an apartment with a middle class lifestyle.  \n\n\n* **Where do \"savings\" go?** Consider this slide: \n\n![image|690x551](upload://omZjgM7ABvxQlDMhPDAJ1RnKzTN.jpeg) \n\n6 to 20% of your rent goes to \"saving\". But the cooperant's investments are remunerated at 2%. So, the rest must go to WC itself, to fund further growth. As a cooperant, I might not be so hellbent to fund growth for growth's sake.\n\nI would be curious to discuss it more in detail with Luc and @patrick_andrews.", "created_at": "2019-11-29 18:34:11.814862", "updated_at": "2019-12-06 09:33:52.724977", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1546, "wiki": false, "reads": 20, "score": 89.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 88726, "user_id": 5025, "topic_id": 15052, "post_number": 4, "raw": "@alberto this is such a clear and well described input.

As I spent 35 years living in Poland and was actively involved in politics, I can go into great detail about how some extremely poor strategic choices were made not by the power of some \"laws of history\" but simply by stupidity and limited world-view of very specific people with very  vested interests. At the same time Poland's situation is not really as \"precarious\" as some would like to think - the country is benefiting from freedom of movement (in both directions), the economy is thriving and competitive, which is perhaps best portrayed by comparison to Ukraine (which in turn only started recovery recently):\n\n![Screenshot_2019-11-22%20ukraine%20vs%20poland%20gdp%20per%20capita%20-%20Wolfram%20Alpha|591x284](upload://kkwFeaHe9oUZDvOl5EITEJu57aF.png)  \n\nThe problems Poland has are strategic - demographics and pensions, rule of law, environment and security. All of these can be resolved, but none of Polish governments was ever really good at any strategic planning, they usually only react rather than preempt. In terms of society, Poland has exactly the same problem as Russia - the society is extremely divided, with around 30% being extremely conservative, tribal, anti-progressive, pseudo-religious (that is, attached to Christian rituals rather than ethics) and living in a constant state of being offended by someone else's past actions, be it next-street neighbour, or a neighbouring state, focused on retribution rather than building future.\n\nPiS is the first mainstream party that took all these sentiments and reinforced them, telling people it's OK to be xenophobic and that it's indeed the fault of Jews, Germans, Ukrainians, Russians, pro-European Poles and everyone else that their salaries are being delayed and public services like healthcare or law enforcement are crap. Then it started to re-shape to country's structure to very much resemble Putin's \"power vertical\", with state-controlled judiciary and state media.\n\nThere's the other 30% of the society that is progressive, pro-social and pro-environmental, but their voice is suppressed by the conseravives and - most importantly - the remaining 40% that is completely depoliticized and just want the state and everyone else to leave them alone.", "created_at": "2019-11-22 09:38:00.684388", "updated_at": "2019-11-22 10:17:00.640875", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 446, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 21.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [65061], "is_reply_to": [65061], "is_liked_by": [2551], "is_private": false}, {"id": 70988, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 12232, "post_number": 9, "raw": "Gina Lucarelli?", "created_at": "2020-03-06 11:07:23.607182", "updated_at": "2020-03-06 11:07:23.607182", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [70980], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22848, "user_id": 100, "topic_id": 1280, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Empowerment et Innovation</b>\n\n@Lyne, @Jamel\n\nJe suis d'accord avec Lyne, non parce qu'elle me cite mais avec raison, mais parce qu'elle a une exp\u00e9rience, elle a observ\u00e9 et a tir\u00e9 des hypoth\u00e8ses qui rejoignent mes propres observations et exp\u00e9riences.

Mais lorsque je leur disais qu'ils pouvaient cr\u00e9er de la connaissance, des solutions in\u00e9dites, j'ai compris que je les mettais mal \u00e0 l'aise, que je cr\u00e9ais une angoisse. Etait-ce la peur de para\u00eetre \u00e9trange, de se tromper? Ou l'impression de faire quelque chose d'interdit?\n\nMon impression \u00e9tait que ces personnes n'\u00e9taient pas libres, qu'elles se sentaient bien dans la relation ma\u00eetre-\u00e9l\u00e8ve et je dirais, qu'innover leur faisait courir le risque de me blesser, de blesser l'amour-propre des autres enseignants. Alors, ces derniers ne conna\u00eetraient pas tout? Mon impression \u00e9tait aussi que ces futurs ing\u00e9nieurs avaient tr\u00e8s peur de se tromper et d'\u00eatre humili\u00e9s.\n\nEnfin de compte, pour innover, il faut avoir confiance en soi, dans les autres et \u00eatre certain de ne pas \u00eatre pers\u00e9cut\u00e9 parce que l'on a essay\u00e9. Et puis il faut avoir des m\u00e9thodes.\n\nQu'en pensez-vous?\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-19 21:17:16", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:06.989197", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 297, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [18033], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 80808, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 11904, "post_number": 12, "raw": "ok, in that case disregard that idea", "created_at": "2020-07-21 08:57:08.300302", "updated_at": "2020-07-21 08:57:08.300302", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 7, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 11.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [80807], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 66227, "user_id": 5775, "topic_id": 11717, "post_number": 3, "raw": "@MariaEuler\nThank U (\":", "created_at": "2019-11-28 16:40:28.036286", "updated_at": "2019-11-28 16:40:28.036286", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 3, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 7.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20476, "user_id": 1485, "topic_id": 756, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Intergenerational Care Projects</b>\n\nThere are a number of\u00a0interesting intergenerational care projects internationally - including:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.carehome.co.uk/news/article.cfm/id/1569940/innovative-american-care-programme\">Present Perfect</a> - USA &amp; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fureai_kippu\">Fureai Kippu</a> - Japan.\n\nThe Deventer initiative is terrific.

Although higher level codes in the hierarchy indeed \"aggregate\" lower level codes, they may carry semantics -- where higher level codes are generalisation of lower level, more specific, ones.

Playing with a level of details on codes might prove useful when navigating a large corpus.\nI form this comment based on my experience working with people on the media where documents are index using entries from a large, hierarchical, thesaurus (categories, sub-categories, down to fine grain keywords). Thesaurus entries are quite similar to ER codes; thesaurus entries precisely form a generalisation/specialisation indexing structure. Having this semantics allows annotators to use more specific codes knowing they also encode more general notions.\nThat being said, ethnographic coding may comply with other principles, and there might be reasons why ER would not want to use such a generalisation/specialisation structure indexing structure, but force lower level codes.", "created_at": "2017-12-06 12:00:05.866443", "updated_at": "2017-12-06 12:00:05.866443", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 188, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 51.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [39958], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 64306, "user_id": 5670, "topic_id": 11566, "post_number": 1, "raw": "**Please mention the name / topic of the event you want to participate in, and the city or town where it is happening.**\n\nName: Chihiro Sato\nEvent: Hackathon for Ethical Solutions to Unethical Problems\nCity: Berlin\n\n**Work, hobbies, family life, leisure, pleasure...

But I don\u2019t want to give up with creating a better world. My professional background is an art director and graphic designer.  Besides working in the commercialists field, I started to doubt designing tools to sale products produced without thinking from an ethical perspective and knowing end users. This feeling brought me to work for a community development project in Japan. \n\nAlso, I am intrigued with that idea: any person can bring their creativity and become a \u2018co-designer\u2019 to help better the world together, and I believe that making a healthy society is a fundamental activity for human beings. In this, I agree with Victor Papanek, who also advocated that \u2018all men are designers. All that we do, almost all the time, is design, for design is basic to all human activity\u2019. \n\nCurrently, I graduated master of design research, and I gained new knowledge of design such as service design, the essence of biomimicry and co-creative approach through practice. In the realm of social design practice, \u2018designing\u2019 is not always done by \u2018expert designers\u2019 trained in specific skills, and co-creation by all stakeholders has become key for solving social issues. However, I think that I will be able to bring these design methodologies, which can tackle social problems and can drive prototyping in the process of the hackathon.\n\n**Great, now that you've made it easier for us to introduce you to the others \u2013 start to think about the topic and purpose of the event itself.

Although, technology enables us to communicate with more people.  I have a personal question about it. I think the accessibility of the internet and social media is a privilege of limited people who live in an abundant world. For example, I can read and can pay for the internet. Today we can ask donation or investment through the several platforms instantly. This is amazing. But, can we really be hearing voices from socially vulnerable people?\n\nThrough the hackathon, I want to find a new clue about new communication for real diversity.\n\n\n\n**name:** Chihiro (Chi) Sato", "created_at": "2019-11-16 03:41:05.158903", "updated_at": "2020-05-18 14:37:40.934519", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 588, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 32.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4934], "is_private": false}, {"id": 78089, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 13750, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Sounds very interesting,\n\nWe already have two calls happening at that time, one on Data Science in context with COVID, one on prekariat in high education, so I wont be able to join. \n\nBut thank you for sharing this here.\n\n@johncoate and @pbihr, do you maybe know people to ping who would be interested in joining this?", "created_at": "2020-06-03 09:26:58.371305", "updated_at": "2020-06-03 09:26:58.371305", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 57, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 6.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 43485, "user_id": 4085, "topic_id": 8345, "post_number": 23, "raw": "\n (like when @anique.yael created the unique Edgeryders version of Shakshuka :sweat_smile:)\n@anique.yael I'm glad to know that you were able to spread the tunisian food culture and i am even more happier that you created your own \" Edgeryders version \" of it .\n**hope you liked it guys**", "created_at": "2018-03-31 18:42:05.693263", "updated_at": "2018-03-31 18:43:20.155889", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 49, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 102.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [43167], "is_liked_by": [4, 3904], "is_private": false}, {"id": 65093, "user_id": 5679, "topic_id": 11634, "post_number": 24, "raw": "[quote=\"trythis, post:22, topic:11634\"]\nThis is a textbook example of the problems I have desperately tried to point out to you in my previous answers.\n[/quote]\n\nIt's a very poor example. **You're trying to prevent usage of the technology in Europe in 2019 using an example from 50's Soviet Union, a country best known for it absolute disrespect for human life and environment and absolute dominance of industrial-military complex over anything else**. Also, the technology might have been indeed poorly understood as it was stolen from the West, yet Stalin has put absolute priority on getting it into work **at any cost**. Which is precisely what happened - from [the very article you linked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayak):\n\n[quote]\nOnce production started up, Soviet engineers quickly ran out of underground space for storage of high level radioactive waste. **Rather than cease production of plutonium** until new underground waste storage tanks could be built, between 1949 and 1951 Soviet managers dumped 7.8 cubic yards of toxic chemicals including 3.2 million [curies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curie) of high-level radioactive waste into the Techa River\n[/quote]\n\nAny \"gaps in knowledge\" here? Sorry, but literally everything in the history of the Mayak plant  demonstrates negligence in dealing with very-well known technologies like cooling or waste recycling **caused by political pressure** rather than some nuanced nuclear-related issues, logically leading to the [1957 disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyshtym_disaster):\n\n[quote]\nIn 1957 the cooling system in one of the tanks containing about 70\u201380 tons of liquid radioactive waste failed and **was not repaired**\n[/quote]\n\nYou had precisely the same culture of negligence cause [anthrax leak from Sverdlovsk bioweapon facility in 1979](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sverdlovsk_anthrax_leak), and hundreds of less-known industrial disasters in USSR.\n\nIf you want to go into the details on how Soviet industry operated and why disasters like Kyshtym or Chernobyl happened, I'm happy to discuss that in detail as I have studied Soviet command economy extensively. For start, I can recommend the [1988 book by Victor Kravchenko](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1791278.I_Chose_Freedom) who was a director of a number of Soviet plants and had first-hand experience with the mess caused by central planning.

Up to the end of 2012 we were running on a Drupal 6 platform; when we moved out of the Council of Europe cradle, we took advantage to upgrade to Drupal 7. Matthias wrote a script to import users and content from the old database into the new one, serving the new platform. As a result, all content is there, and linked to its author. However, some of the non-core modules in the Drupal Commons distribution are only imperfectly linked to the database (maybe they store creation dates in some array somewhere). Profile management changed a lot from D6 to D7 (profiles used to be nodes!), so this is a particularly messy department. User activity is one of them, so it is not tracked against content created on the old platform and then imported. Edgesense, on the other hand, is more rigorous, because it goes right to the database, and essentially ignores all the intermediate PHP manipulation made by Drupal.</li>\n\n</ul>", "created_at": "2015-03-13 10:50:06", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:53.739347", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 253, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 41766, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 6748, "post_number": 32, "raw": "Agree", "created_at": "2018-02-13 11:33:03.602979", "updated_at": "2018-02-13 11:33:03.602979", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 21.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [41711], "is_liked_by": [854], "is_private": false}, {"id": 42306, "user_id": 4301, "topic_id": 7856, "post_number": 22, "raw": "@Sofien-Dahem, @hazem here is a video about the Nopal cactus I told you about. @hazem the video is in spanish, but you can speak it already a little bit no?

The ego needs to be put aside too\u2026this general tendency to think that you have may know all the right solutions because you're a big organization with capacities and also as an individual: insisting that no, i don't need any help so i won't ask anyone for it; especially from those institutions that won't give me any money.</span></span>\n\n<span>I think our involvement in STF is a step towards communication and w<span>e're trying to learn this new methodology of bringing people together and engaging in conversation and encouraging collective action. Citizens ARE rising as the experts, they're fixing their own problems for themselves and aren't looking for institutional support. This is the time where institutions are realizing that maybe my top-down approach isn't working - we don't have all the answers to everything and we should be reaching within the grassroots to find out what interesting solutions do they have and support them.</span></span>\n\n<span><span>I think there should be a consolidated platform where UNDP, or any institution if we\u2019re generally speaking, can engage in direct dialogue with individuals who are working on change; Edgeryders could be a good place to start doing so. Moreover, individuals should be involved in the design process of projects and programmes because at the end of the day they\u2019re implemented for the citizens</span>.</span>\n\n<span>We need to identify, together, the areas in which we could help each other and fill in the missing gaps. How do we fill in these gaps? could be something as big as implementing a project together to something as small as a piece of advice: so resources, expertise, capacities, networks - forget about the money and think about social capital.</span>\n\nOnce Spot the Future is complete, we don\u2019t want it to stop there. We want to find ways of scaling up the experience, reach out to others outside our channels, and continue the conversation; but in order for us to do so it has to be a collective effort.

Has anyone here seen any significant / substantial / material progress in the last 20 months? \n\nTo address @alberto's last point, (hi! :) ) the potential I see is in co-ordination, not in merging of organisations. I'm keen to reopen this discussion on two levels: first, from the point of view of role differentiation, specialisation, efficiency (yes) and overall effectiveness; and second, specifically from the point of view of information systems. My personal intuition is that there is a very great deal that we could give to each other in terms of overall synergy, if we were more carefully to explore this, which is no more really than Principle 6 of the [ICA co-operative principles](https://www.ica.coop/en/whats-co-op/co-operative-identity-values-principles) &mdash; co-operation among co-operatives.\n\nAnd to answer @alberto's direct question, yes, I agree (and so do my co-op partners) that collaboration is best focused around projects. My question is, _how do we take the first step, and find the projects that we will collaborate on?_ My tentative answer, for the moment, is that we have dialogue across organisations, across networks, between those people who \"get\" the point of collaboration. This has a research aspect (Edgeryders) a governance aspect (Enspiral) and an entrepreneurial aspect (Ouishare), so it should be stimulating, if we can find the right participants.\n\nOne idea is that we could aim to bring together systems thinkers and developers in a systems stream at future events in the Human Networks Festival calendar.\n\nAnyone like to collaborate on this?", "created_at": "2018-10-08 13:39:40.803961", "updated_at": "2018-10-08 13:42:39.695282", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 302, "wiki": false, "reads": 26, "score": 65.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 79192, "user_id": 6455, "topic_id": 13915, "post_number": 2, "raw": "@kajafarszky", "created_at": "2020-06-19 12:49:43.508471", "updated_at": "2020-06-19 12:49:43.508471", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 27.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5667], "is_private": false}, {"id": 41770, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 8068, "post_number": 11, "raw": "[quote=\"matthias, post:7, topic:8068\"]\nThere are never \"no rules\". Informal organizing comes with its own rules, they are just not made explicit. People spend a lot of time trying to figure out what these rules are. (For example, I still don't know if it's acceptable to leave un-done dishes in the kitchen when you use one or two items in the evening and leave, as the last one.)\n[/quote]\n\nThis is both true and important. Explicit is good, *up to a point*. If there are explicit rules about everything, life can feel a little dreary. So explicit-ness also has diminishing returns, and should be treated as a scarce resource. The good news is that you can make things clear without going formal, by nudging or design. \n\n**Example of nudging**. In Sidi Kaouki I also noticed the example, mentioned by Matt, of leaving a few dirty dishes in the sink. I personally don't like it; at home, I never do it. What to do? At home, I wash any small stuff that I find in the sink, even if it's not my own. Reason: I'm nudging. If people find an empty sink, they will tend to leave an empty sink, as per the [broken windows theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory). That works at home, but Kaouki is maybe too fluid a social environment for that, with people coming and going. Maybe a \"your mom does not work here\" sticker next to the sink will do the trick. \n\n**Example of design**. On our shopping expeditions to Essaouira, I have been hellbent on finding a second rack to dry up the clean dishes (I eventually found it \u2013 and, @SyMorin, we recovered it from the taxi driver, so don't worry!). Why? Because I had noticed that our one rack tended to be overfull with dishes. This means that, when you did the dishes, you had to start by unloading the rack and putting the clean stuff away. This is an unsolved \"problem\" (not a big deal, really) even at The Reef Brussels. I reasoned that, with two, you would have more slack in the system. At 90 Dirham, it was cheaper than wasting everyone's time talking about this. \n\nI can also live with a few dirty cups in the sink or an overflowing dish rack, it's not that big a deal. That's why the worst solution would be a massive debate about whether dirty cups in the sink are good or bad. Because these debates also consume processing power, *and* they have a potential for controversy and dreariness. Let the House *not* be remembered as a place where smart people spent time talking about this stuff. This is why we have a Master of the House, and that's @hazem. What he says, goes. \n\nhttps://xkcd.com/1445/", "created_at": "2018-02-13 12:24:38.201879", "updated_at": "2018-02-13 12:24:38.201879", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 479, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 13.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [41747], "is_reply_to": [41747], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 68142, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 12286, "post_number": 7, "raw": "And there is no doubt that Facebook uses such psyche techniques.

Often now political. Sometimes true, sometimes not.  And who can tell most of the time?  \n\nIn November 2019, Edgeryders Fellow Zenna Fiscella Interviewed PhD student  Max Schl\u00fcter who is on a quest to find the nature of memes, how they propagate, who propagates them most successfully and what makes them work where others fail.  It's a deep dive and he is early in his adventure, but he has already uncovered a number of salient points on the matter.  Zenna brings in how memes influence the commercial world.  Are some of these propagations paid for?\n\n\n(Posted with written permission)\n\nZenna:\n\nWelcome to the second episode of EdgeRyders. Today we have max Schl\u00fcter with us who's a PhD student with a focus on\u2026\n\nMax:\n\nMemetics, dis-information and the organizational practice surrounding them.\n\nZenna:\n\nYes. To translate that into non academic terminology, that is\u2026\n\nMax:\n\nI'm looking at memes basically, from right wing and also left wing extremists, how they use to disinform and shape public discourse.\n\nZenna:\n\nvia memes, yes.\n\nMax:\n\nvia memes, yes.\n\nZenna:\n\nOkay. So this is very curious. It's a new practice. To start off just to get an introduction, how does one study that?\n\nMax:\n\nPeople have looked at memes for longer than you might expect. I think the term itself has been around for around 20 or 30 years and it initially started out in the science fiction scene, like many things started out. But then academic papers have been written around memes starting 2010 ish earlier as well but like the ones I'm really focusing on are <NOT SURE OF FIRST NAME> Schiffman hailing out of Israel, she's been writing about good 10 years now about memes and how they used and memes and disinformation or memes and as a as a media practice to dis-inform and to shape public discourse. I've been also five years within a discourse. But for me, it's more important to look at the people behind it so I'm not more having more ethnographic approach.\n\nZenna:\n\nSo for those of a different generation, or for those who simply don't meme very much, how extensive are memes and how extensive do you believe they are shaping online culture today?\n\nMax:\n\n\u201chow extensive\u201d - in what way do you mean?\n\nZenna:\n\nlike, Is it very common?\n\nMax:\n\nMemes, yes. The term itself - like the definition of the term is kind of very loose like it like a lot of things, and it kind of varies from person to person what a meme is, it can be a inside joke can be declared a meme, it can be the very traditional image macro of like image and text on top. That could be considered a meme. Short videos or haikus can be considered memes. And they're kind of all encompassing in digital culture. I would say that they penetrate a lot of different discourses and groups. And that's why it's so interesting to look at memes because they are everywhere. Everybody uses them. And I just read a very interesting article yesterday about about metaphors. And they had one metaphor to describe memes from Whitney Phillips, I think, was as a cardboard cutout and she talked about how a meme can be considered as a cardboard cutout. Everybody can print a cardboard cutout and put it in the room. But every room that it is used in kind of changes the meaning of the meme, right? So like if you have a cardboard cutout of Donald Trump in a very feminist left wing party, they're going to be have a very Like a different view of what it's supposed to mean, then at the right wing rally, for example. So, yeah means a very all encompassing, I would say.\n\nZenna:\n\nAnd the interpretation of them changes with the context.\n\nMax:\n\nDefinitely.\n\nZenna:\n\nSo you started a bit of a journey. We had a conversation days ago, and you described it almost like a detective journey. Do you? Do you want to share your journey?\n\nMax:\n\nI can. I mean, I'm on this journey still and still, but I'm always on kind of. And right now, as I'm trying to understand all of this, this project, this prospect, especially thinking about also people behind memes, I've been starting to get into contact with a lot of people and going through leads, and it's almost like, depending on who I talk to, you get different intros into topic of memetic disinformation. One of the most interesting one or the most well studied one This 2016 presidential elections in the US, and then from there is a lot of different people you can follow different memes you can follow different ideas you can follow. But everything that's been written is very old. Not very old, but due to the fact how long books take to print and editing, things are two, three years behind what's actually happening right now. So I'm on the prowl, you could say, to figure out what's happening now. What's the practice now who's doing it? Where the interesting people?\n\nZenna:\n\nWould you say there are big actors behind memes used for spreading disinformation, so to say?\n\nMax:\n\nThere are, I guess there are main actors. It's a bit early in my research to name any actors. I mean, there is some people that have been studied before. For example, Gabrielle Coleman has been writing about a very prominent person in general in meme culture, or in troll cultures called \u201cweave\u201d, who was before in Anonymous or part of Anonymous, however, you can be in Anonymous, and now he's linked to All Right, memetics. So he will be one of the he will be maybe one of those key actors you're talking about, but there's way, way, way, way, way more, and it's very limited our understanding of it. And also of course groups are part of that, right? Like, different groupings on Discord. For example, Unicorn Riot. It's independent journalist group of journalists that revealed a lot of these hidden communities on discord through\u2026\n\nZenna:\n\nOkay, so for those who don't know, sorry, what's Discord?\n\nMax:\n\nDiscord is traditionally I think, targeted at gamers and marketed to gamers and its communication platform, I think, I hope I'm not stumbling over my words, because platform is such a big word, but a communication tool where people can meet up and create groups,\n\nZenna:\n\nAnd it's for chat and voice.\n\nMax:\n\nIt's for voice chat. It's kind of like TeamSpeak. If anybody's listening that knows about TeamSpeak. And it's kind of built on that logic of having chat rooms and then also being able to talk to each other through voice.\n\nZenna:\n\nAnd so something that you mentioned to me a while back, which was news to me at the time, was that there's pretty large organizational happenings, organized via Discord. And specifically for the right wing extreme?\n\nMax:\n\nI think both most likely, because they have a very interesting policy of as long as we don't know it we don't see it. So as long as these communities are not pointed at, they can exist on the platform, which a lot of platforms actually use that, that logic are used to use that logic as long as nobody's conservative, nobody's gonna ban them, mostly also, because of the sheer size of people that platforms have to consider it, right. So a lot of these extremist groupings take to Discord and obviously other communication tools. And this is why it's so interesting, because it's always shifting and changing.\n\nZenna:\n\nAnd that's what the group uncovered. The rainbow..\n\nMax:\n\nUnicorn Riot. They discovered different groupings. Yes. Today we're <GERMAN WORD>, because the German word \u201cUndercover\u201d in these groups, many of them taking various forms of how do you say, vetting so before you can join, you have to take the quiz you have to show your allegiance to the right wing ideals you have to send your ID card perhaps you have to so that they are not in trouble of getting ratted out. Right. So they have like a very..\n\nZenna:\n\nSo they have actually strict policies in place in order to stop people\n\nMax:\n\nfrom intruding. Yeah, so it\u2019s like a ban. The right wing parties are cautious, not the platform owners. They don't, I don't know if they don't care, but there's it's the two extremes groupings they don't want to get found, of course, because then you would destroy their communication.\n\nZenna:\n\nand scheming.\n\nOkay, so one thing that I found very interesting about memes and that we talked about a bit awhile back, I'm a complete novice when it comes to academically studying memes.\n\nI do quite often scroll through Reddit and without cookies on. And I do that as a way to look at what memes are naturally being brought to the front page by the algorithms. And I mentioned this to you but the whole \u201cPicachu\u201d meme, and how that correlated with the Pikachu movie release.\n\nMax:\n\nDo you my mind kind of explaining that?\n\nZenna:\n\nThank you. Well, basically, in November 2018 Suddenly, there was a spike with this surprise Pikachu meme, and I was surprised that it was suddenly such a big thing with this one random picture of Pikachu being surprised. And it's always fascinating how means and mean formats kickoff, so eventually I heard about the new Pikachu detective movie that was released shortly after. And I realized that there could be a correlation. And so that would indicate that not only are political groupings using it, but also for capitalist motives. As a form of subliminal commercials.\n\nMax:\n\nYes, definitely. Yes, I believe that. That is, it is a good statement. And I believe that is to be true and to be proven also true that various companies are using memes or the meme format, or the visual format of memes in order to appropriate a capitalistic viewpoint unto what is traditionally a very community created thing. Yeah, I believe that to be true. I could see how that works.\n\nBecause memes differ from - there's like a very important distinction between virals and memes. As a viral is only one single sample like a viral video, for example. So just one community felt that people flocked to this country viral thing, whereas a meme, by definition is always re-appropriated and re-edited while the creation of it perhaps could be seen as something that once had a capitalistic viewpoint on it, like the appropriations of it are very, in a sense personal and it's very hard to control the way a meme spreads. So that's why I'm a little bit unsure of that, if that's possible, because you wouldn't need to have either a big community or a big network of bots, in order to first get a meme to start off and then get community appropriated.\n\nZenna:\n\nBut with a format, it's implied within the format already. So no matter the content that's put above it, it\u2019s still embedded within the form I'm thinking of. Another one that I've been reacting to lately that's been very popular is girls are like, \u201csomething something\u201d and then us boys \u201csomething, something.\u201d Have you seen that one around? It's become really, really big. I'm probably paraphrasing it wrong.\n\nMax:\n\nNo, it might just be me.\n\nZenna:\n\nAnd just implied in that format, there's also the aspect of gender groupings\n\nthat are being\n\nMax:\n\nbinary, false binary, perhaps even\n\nZenna:\n\nyes, and also just the chauvinistic, the \u201cwe,\u201d because the we becomes the dominant voice and the narrative there. What would be like an example for like, right wing meming, for example, or left wing meming?\n\nMax:\n\nSo the thing is when you look at it; when I'm looking from academic point of view it means the viewpoints you can have on them are limitless, right? You can have a viewpoint that is focused on the visual aesthetics of memes and why they are, why they are interesting, then you have a viewpoint that focuses on the distribution, right? Like things that are redistributed things: like how do they defuse and then you could have a viewpoint that's very cultural science like, influenced by a very humanistic viewpoint like the one you just had.\n\nI mean, an example of a right wing meme, I don't think I could give you examples but like just I don't think it exists as like, \u201cthis is what we need to have a rightwing meme.\u201d The interesting thing or the difficult thing, or also scary thing, is that the appropriate the form of that already exists and subliminally create messaging in these formats that are perhaps, like you just mentioned, have either chauvinistic viewpoint or inherently anti or racial viewpoints. And the interesting thing is that these memes then are through the way that these groups are organizing both on the left and the right but little bit better on the on the right, I had some friends told me that right people just meme better. They're better organized in that way.\n\nZenna:\n\nOh, that's so funny. I know people who would say the exact opposite. (Laughs.)\n\nMax:\n\nIt's interesting, maybe you should connect me to the other people that that through the way\n\nZenna:\n\nIt's a subreddit called right wingers can't meme.\n\nMax:\n\nGreat. Through that way they are kind of playing a rhythm, right? Like if you create this new meme that is has like the already successful format that is proven to be successful. And then you have a bunch of people uploading it at the same time, these messages just kind of get thrown into the discourse.\n\nZenna:\n\nSo you mentioned something there that I think is interesting to also happen to further. That's the concept that in order to make a meme go viral, if you post it at a certain time, and you have a certain amount of people uploading it within the first few minutes, it's almost ensured that the meme will rise and gain traction, so to speak. So in a sense, that also could make it pretty cheap almost to buy the traction of memes. And thus, the establishment of certain cultures. The train of thought, right now is, if it's easy to buy cultures, and they're actively are groups that organize around producing means to create subliminal messages, how can people have real culture nowadays? How can there be real internet culture and what spaces would those be?\n\nMax:\n\nI agree with you to two large extent with the question, but then you kind of take a turn and then it's a very real and wrong. I don't I don't know if there's a dualism that I would say having everything that is digital is real. Everything is online culture. In online culture you\u2019re saying that, as soon as they're appropriated by businesses is not any more real culture?\n\nZenna:\n\nI'm saying it's seemingly created by community, out of genuine\u2026\n\nMax:\n\nOh you'd want to know where the border is kind of\u2026\n\nZenna:\n\nYeah, if the spaces that are popular for distributing memes nowadays, are easily bought up without it, especially probably nine gags (?), or whatever else. Where are the spaces that are genuine meme producers?\n\nMax:\n\nOkay, it's a question I don't work with on a daily, but just from thinking about it.\n\nZenna:\n\nDo you think it's something that should exist?\n\nMax:\n\nI feel like it sounds a little bit relativistic (?) in that way. Like these are genuine memes, and these aren\u2019t? Who is that to judge. And in the end, you are the judge of that. So you will find the places that make the genuine memes for you, right. I mean, traditionally, most, I think there's actually studies of dissemination from of memes. And most of them start on 4chan, and 8chan, which are still sporting a very, very, very basic structure of online organization. So they don't have any algorithm mix, or uploads or likes or any metrics that go hand in hand with the page. So there will be maybe a place where you find genuine content if you want, that isn't metrified and bought up.\n\nZenna:\n\nThat's an interesting one, because I've been reading about \u2013 well, it ties back a little bit to what you talked about before. About the meme persona you mentioned who had a background of \u201cbelonging.\u201d (Insert quotation marks for those who can't see) belonging to Anonymous and establishing a large culture also based from 4chan, because Anonymous and 4chan are tied together.\n\nThe groups on Discord. Are they tied into 4chan as well? Or 8chan?\n\nMax:\n\nThat's a good question. I don't know. I don't know. Yeah. To a certain extent there's some groupings that some people that have been, especially in the in the realm of investigative journalists and infiltration researchers that have taken up certain communities, especially in Germany that has been is called the \u201cconquest RK Monica\u201d (?) was a big hit piece on people that were kind of linking real people to the Discord personas. But to which extent they're connected to 4chan, I cannot tell you right now, I don't know. I wouldn't know. It\u2019s an interesting question, because I feel like there's a different intention behind that, right? Like, we kind of quick to throw together a lot of people as the same like into the same wording and slum and box. Whereas I believe that, especially people that are targeting memetic warfare are more into playing with the algorithms and trying to get their memes up to the top. Whereas, perhaps some other people are just trolling or putting memes up because they're there for the community aspect of it. And I guess there's some people that are overlapping. Yeah. But I feel like in general, when it comes to creating successful memes, and when you want to rate them on a metric scale, then they are targeting bigger platforms, or mainstream platform.\n\nZenna:\n\nSo speaking of boxing's to go into a box, that's not the 4chan right wing box, there has been the case of GovZero in Taiwan. And I heard that the process that they had been working on, that they've been making stickers to use on the phones. So because all people in Taiwan send a lot of stickers on the phones and then they would be placing subtle messages inside the stickers on the phones, to demonstrate a certain political view, this whole process stems out of this longer political process of basically forking the government of Taiwan. So they will take the government's web pages create a very similar one or similar URL and domain name, and then copy paste the website but change the content.\n\nMax:\n\nWhat I think you might be getting at, let me say differently. In that case, I think if you want to compare it to memes was one other question you were looking at maybe in the case of the GovZero and Taiwan, I think it is, in that case different because the message in the stickers is hidden and is it is for a very certain audience to be to be found. Whereas in memetics, I think the interesting or the other scary part about it is that the message is intentionally mainstream. Like, everybody is supposed to be able to uncover the message and it gets blurted out.\n\nZenna:\n\nBut it is subliminal.\n\nMax:\n\nIt is subliminal, yes.\n\nZenna:\n\nWhat was the correlation between those two, between subliminal and a mainstream message?\n\nMax:\n\nSubliminal in a sense that it is supposed to steer discourse without you necessarily knowing, whereas in GovZero stickers are used to\u2026you have to already be in the in-group in order to understand them, right? Like you won't just see the sticker and have a message in there. The sticker itself is message-less, right?\n\nZenna:\n\nI've never actually seen that myself.\n\nMax:\n\nOkay, maybe we shouldn\u2019t talk about it because I didn't know anything about it either. <laughter>\n\nI was just thinking about when you say like hiding it in stickers. Yeah, maybe we should talk about it. I'll look into it. It sounds interesting.\n\nZenna:\n\nWe'll go back to her comfortable corners of 4chan. You know, I started out there <laughs>. Yeah. You too probably. You can see it? Is it on my face?\n\nMax:\n\nknow I could I could see it in terms of, I can see you there.\n\nZenna:\n\n<laughs> I\u2019ll take that as a dis! Ok it\u2019s a compliment.\n\nMax:\n\nIt\u2019s a loving nudge.\n\nZenna:\n\nAll right. So I feel like there's so much more we could be talking about.\n\nMax:\n\nYeah, we can talk about it again.\n\nZenna:\n\nYes, some other time.

Why?\n* Do you think the walkaway economy (in-world) was consciously designed by walkaways? Did it emerge?\n* Would you see yourself living in this kind of economy? Would you like to? Why?\n* Do you think an economy like the walkaway economy could sustain itself in the real world? In which conditions?\n* Can you think of real-world arrangements that remind you of the walkaway economy?\n\n### Preparation (+ cheatsheet)\n\n* Ideally, read _Walkaway_! Not only does it contain fantastic world building, with a super-interesting economy; it is also a highly enjoyable piece of SF, with lovable characters. \n* If you do not have the time for that, you can just read the first two chapters. Chapter 1 contains the main critique to our present economy; Chapter 2 presents how the economy works in walkaway. If you can only read one chapter, read Chapter 2.\n* If you do not have time even for that, read [my long post](https://edgeryders.eu/t/the-economics-of-cory-doctorows-walkaway/8828/3?u=alberto) on the economics of Walkaway. It contains quotes from the text and what I think is a valid economic interpretation for them. Doctorow agrees with my analysis.\n\n### Additional reading\n\nIf you finished _Walkaway_ and you feel energized to sink your teeth into the economics, you can read the following:\n\n* Doctorow's own economic essay on the book, [Coase's spectre](http://crookedtimber.org/2017/05/10/coases-spectre/). \n* My own reflections on _Walkaway_'s economic content.

I recently heard Jananne Al-Ani present some work she had done using photography. I think it was called \"Shadow Sites. She approaches this topic from a different angle, more fine arts. Her talk/presentation at \\#ireality I found really inspiring and I think it will be available online.... will embed it here as soon as I get it.\n\nMm a few other thoughts spring to mind to do with other cultures and traditions for storytelling or preserving memories. In some African cultures there is the tradition of libation, a kind of ritual or prayer for keeping memory of people who you care about and have passed present. I've seen it used very effectively to give weight to even institutional meetings. In a western context it would seem weird, but there is something worth exploring there: how you keep memory of what has been present in what you do. Not just in artefacts or records, whether digital or analog but in relationships and behaviours.. Technosocial being the operative term here.\n\nWhy does this matter- Well if no one uses it what is the point? Unesco I know has done a lot of work to try to \"preserve\" or \"archive\" cultural artefacts and traditions. Like putting together a collection of African histories. But to be honest I had no idea about any of this, or what Unesco does for that matter, until I was at an event with some people who work there last year.\u00a0 On the other hand Tahir Hemphill has built a cool project which while it references the past feels contemporary because the point of entry is something a lot of people care about and are interested in right now\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/uIVWd_d9zXI\n\nI havent p;ayed with it yet but you can find on visualisation here <a href=\"http://tahirhemphill.com/champagne/\">http://tahirhemphill.com/champagne/</a>\n\n", "created_at": "2014-09-24 12:18:44", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:53.163416", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 370, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29501, "user_id": 854, "topic_id": 4081, "post_number": 14, "raw": "<b>superficial considerations</b>\n\nAs I have recently shared with @Alberto, I am not so much worried about our time-to-deadline ticking out, as I have got the feeling during our first conference call that we all have rather good intuitions about the proposal.\n\nRather, I am worried about the overall chances of success. In facts, the official statistics are rather disheartening, with a success rate for the 1st round of H2020 somewhere around 11%... but I am told that figures of the throughput from proposal (not stage 2, which are already past a bottleneck) to contract signature can be as low as 2%...\n\nIt is thus of the utmost importance for all of us to approach this proposal preparation with a stronger commitment: the will to move on with (at least) certain core activities, even in case of the CAPS grant application failing.\n\nI have been told by @Alberto that some sort of contingency plan concerning alternative potential sources of funding are already on the radar of some. I would invite everyone to keep these realistic scenarios in mind, and to imagine how to exploit the existence of this consortium to push forward our ideas, whatever the outcome of our effort should be.

Language birthed culture and hunter-gatherer tribes. Writing forged kingdoms and agriculture-age empires. Printing enabled nations and industrial-age economies. The Internet launched a new restructuring of society, but is constrained by computing tech designed for centralized control. Learning from nature's blueprints, Ceptr provides an evolvable, fully distributed framework for coordination and sense-making on all scales.\" [Arthur Brock](http://ceptr.org/)\n\n\"If we are to preserve the democratic and creative promise of the Internet, we must continuously diagnose control points as they emerge and devise mechanisms of recreating diversity of constraint and degrees of freedom in the network to work around these forms of reconcentrated power.\" [Yochai Benkler](http://benkler.org/Degrees_of_Freedom_Dimensions_of_Power_Final.pdf)\n\n___________\n\nEach of us wants to have control over how and with whom we interact. In order to evolve and thrive, our communities must support everyone's uniqueness. Yet today, our online relationships are dominated by centralized corporate web sites.\n\nIn this event, you will learn about some peer-to-peer projects based on blockchain and holochain technologies that enable a distributed web with user autonomy built directly into its architecture and protocols. Data is about remembering our lived and shared experiences. Distributing the storage and processing of that data can change how we coordinate and interact. With digital integration under user control, these technolgies liberate our online lives from corporate control over our choices and information.\n\nCome and hear about Collaboration, Collective Intelligence and Next Generation Internet technologies that facilitate this to happen!\n\n***Schedule and Content:***\n\n09:00 am - Registration, coffee and networking\n\n09:30 am - Welcome words, data and collective intelligence.

Techniques for architecture and construction</h2>\n\n* **Exploring a proposal before it's built.** Architects to models a lot (actual physical models, not just 3D models). Others do a lot of discussions with potential users, to explore how they react to their design ideas.\n\n* **Exploring construction innovations on a small scale.** For construction innovations aimed at large-scale application, architecture studios (like that of [Renzo Piano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renzo_Piano)) combine architecture with research. That however cannot really be pulled off for a single community building. There are also software packages for thermal modeling, light modeling etc. \u2013 these are useful for spatial innovation, not for material innovation. Because non-standard materials are hard to model with these software packages. It may be possible (with the PEB thermal modeling software package for example) but even for professionals, using that software is hard and expensive. Ideally there would be open source software packages that encapsulated the complexity and allows non-professionals to take over design and modeling tasks formerly reserved for professionals. However, that seems not to exist (yet).\n\n    A more appropriate technique for such a setup is to create a setting (both physical and by social organization) that is welcoming the construction innovations. This can include, for example: a building that is simple to re-configure; piping and wiring that allow to install new innovative machines and devices wherever people want; a large on-site workshop that allows to adapt the building and its equipment quickly.\n\n* **Innovation is hard. To make living greener, invest in human expertise instead.** Innovation of products and materials often does not work at the start, and requires a lot of experimentation before it is ready for general use.\n\n    For a small-scale setup like a communal living space, a more appropriate way to innovate green living could be \"process innovation\" for building maintenance. Basically, build up a system so that the community can maintain its own space: train different members as plumbers, electricians etc. and also get the relevant tools so that all problems can be fixed with little effort, extending the building's utility, lifetime, and eco-friendliness. Investing in human expertise cannot go wrong, while investing in new materials and technologies may go wrong.\n\n    A simple example: a concrete wall made from some new composite is not self-maintainable and may thus only last 50 years. There is no real need for such a wall though, as brick walls have been around for hundreds of years and we know how to maintain them for that amount of time. Innovation is also important, but one of the greatest values of a building is that we can keep it alive, and that is an important aspect of buildings being \"green\".\n\n* **The impact of human care on buildings.** Buildings don't last \"100 years\" like that, it can be 30 years or 300 years depending on the quality of their maintenance. So the cost of providing a function for a certain time is more determined by the care afterwards than by the initial investment. For example, Renzo Piano will rebuild the bridge that recently collapsed in Italy, with a version in steel that \"will last 1000 years\", as he says. He did not mention with what maintenance. And bad maintenance was the main reason why the first bridge collapsed. So whatever you build, don't care only for materials and high-tech, also care to put money into operation and maintenance. Because it is a new approach, this is innovative for the current time. Modern \"sensor and IoT equipped\" buildings can be a nightmare to maintain.\n\n* **On new facade materials (like PV panels).** There is a house in Australia using PV panels as roof covering, somewhat tilted so that light can still get through to the inside. In architecture, there are multiple uses of wall finishing / cladding: weather protection, and allowing the building to breathe (humidity transfer to the outside to prevent humidity buildup, mould, dampness indoors etc.). Depending on weather condition, the outer layer is of different permeability, impacting how the building is breathing. In some parts of Portugal, tiles are used for example.\n\n    So to start hacking together a new cladding system (such as from PV panels), a good tip is to start with experimentation. Nothing too big, nothing too drastic at the start. \"Play with it.\" Just to see how the material behaves, how it can be attached etc.. It will be difficult to pull off such a hack, as the material was not designed for such a use, so may perform worse for it than industrial cladding systems. Or at least it will probably not perform better. For PV panels, a purely ornamental use (plus power generation of course) of PV panels, or a use as a sight protection / separation wall on a fence or similar, could be the first experiments, as not so much can go wrong.\n\n* **Economics of reuse, recycling and local production.** Stuff is not made to be recycled today, and industrial-scale recycling is mostly about destroying everything, sorting the stuff and re-using the glass, metal and some of the plastic. Nothing is re-used for what it because that is a lot of manual work. And manual work is not time efficient, and we have not enough money in Europe to pay people for much of their time anymore. Just enough to pay them for operating machines \u2013 everything else is manufactured by machines or in China. The same limitations apply to unique construction of houses \u2013 instead, all new houses now look very similar, and the look results from the optimization to be built with machines, not with manual work. Again, the same limitations apply to building maintenance: in earlier centuries, a building was always maintained so it could live \"forever\". Now, buildings have an expiry date and are then destroyed and replaced, because maintenance is \"too expensive\" manual work that cannot be automated away.\n\n    In communal living, there is no general solution to that, but at least a partial one. Namely, comparing the cost of worktime and machine work is just a financial comparison that does not capture all the value. By working less outside of the community and more inside, people will have fun making their own things \"inefficiently\", and in total may prefer that to working for money and buying industrially made items. That's even more applicable when starting to make things not from scratch but from the waste of the surrounding society, such as all the stuff one can take out of buildings before they are being destroyed.\n\n* **On the development of architecture.** The traditional architecture in different areas is very different, also within Europe. It developed over hundreds of years of incremental development. In the last 50 years, that changed a lot, so now most new houses all around Europe are built very similarly. Is that bad, and should we rather just trust the traditional, accumulated knowledge?\n\n    Indeed, architecture always changes, and traditional knowledge gets lost. We don't understand a lot of building features of traditional architecture and material use. It's ok that processes change, the problem with the new processes is that they are not developed from careful observation of the objects and environment. For example, houses are optimized for efficient construction and not to last (because \"cheap materials, expensive labor for construction and maintenance\"). Similarly, commercial buildings like banks are remodeled every 7 years.\n\n    New ways of green building can be informed from this process of \"careful observation\" of the past. That will allow to build with cheaper and more environmentally friendly materials in a way that achieves the same or better effects as with today's \"modern\" materials.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2. Building features and space utilization</h2>\n\n* **Workplace / office integration.** Offices are a very inefficient use of space: they are empty 16 or 24 hours a day, and still consume resources and represent embodied energy and emissions. Rather have your office in your home, for example a super-easy-to-clean room that is an office during the day and a party room in the evening. To be easy to clean, dangling furniture mounted to the ceiling could be a new approach.\n\n* **Starting from an old office building.** The advantage here is that partition walls etc. can be easily removed and reconfigured.\n\n* **On unused buildings.** An unused building is a waste of embodied energy and emissions, as it will decay even when not in use, and even faster, without providing any use value in return. However, nothing is won if the empty buildings are filled with capitalist money-making endeavors like rental apartments, for-profit businesses or even temporary rental contracts that can be cancelled within two weeks (as done by Camelot). They should be filled up with pro-social projects and activities: sustainability, not money-making. Because today's money-making is very expensive considering its effects on the future.\n\n* **Mobile conversion kit for temporary spaces.** That's a different approach to having an \"own\" space, and much simpler to realize: have a container with a kit to transform any abandoned building into a comfortable space within 7 days for 1-3 years of temporary use, with 2 days at the end to take all of that equipment out again. If this is about buildings that will be destroyed anyway, it will even be ok to remove walls and change the structure of the building when moving in. Utilizing abandoned buildings is also environmentally friendly because the continued maintenance extends the lifetime of these buildings.\n\n* **Investment security and temporary spaces.** The real reason why temporary occupation is not a perspective for middle-class communal living is: there is no perspective to keep the investments made into changing and renovating the space. And the investments middle-class people make into buildings are usually their only savings, so they really want to safeguard them.\n\n* **Build something old, not something new.** Trying a conversion to make an old space look new is difficult, esp. on a budget. But trying to make an old space look old but great is much simpler and cheaper. It just needs old materials and good \"shabby chic\" taste.\n\n* **Communal music room.** Another nice thing to integrate. Needs equipment, lockers for equipment, soundproofing etc.. Makes for nice communal activities, getting to know each other, including by inviting bands from outside the community to practice.\n\n* **Communal living with or without apartmentalizing.** If everyone has an own apartment and on top the communal spaces (party kitchen, courtyard, swimming pool etc.), it becomes more expensive per person, less space efficient and less resource efficient. It can work well in social terms, though. There may be a middle ground of providing individual rooms with private bathrooms each. Student housing in the UK is like that, but not quite. Also, youth hostels are like that, but not comfortable for the longer term.\n\n* **Floors as sub-structuring.** In the Cent-vingt-trois project in Brussels, floors emerged as a natural way to structure the space. Each floor had a certain dedication / specialty, for example children, receiving guests, or punk / anarchist aesthetics. The higher up the floor, the fewer random visitors it would get as there were no stairs \u2013 effectively allowing people to choose their level of privacy. People could move between floors, and that was the mechanism how the personalities of floors naturally emerged in the first place. This mechanism allowed people to live with people they like, and avoid people they don't like \u2013 which always happens, and is a larger problem in smaller communities where there is less space.\n\n* **Person-tracking IR heaters.** A version of the parabolic electric IR heaters mounted on a person-tracking pan-tilt head could be an interesting, low-powered way to keep people warm.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--3\">3. Dealing with rules and laws</h2>\n\n* **Incentive problems with utility costs.** In Brussels, a lot of rental contracts come with flat rate costs for water, electricity, gas and heating use. That is a huge problem that prevents green living, as there are no individual incentives against excessive consumption resp. for frugal consumption. So none of the ~80% of consumption reduction by behavior change is realized in such living situations. As a solution, utility companies should provide services (\"a warm house\") instead of materials (\"gas\"), as that gets the incentives right.\n\n* **Incentive problems with insulation and rooftop PV.** In Brussels, houses are often rented out by absentee landlords who have not much of an interest in a building beyond it generating rental income. So they will not insulate the building better (and heating costs are paid by tenants anyway). They will also not install rooftop photovoltaics (and that is compounded by collective ownership of apartment buildings, where owners have a hard time agreeing even on essential investments). This could not even be really solved by a current comfortable offer by a Belgian company to \"make your roof earn money\" by letting them install photovoltaics there. As a solution, the city could take over the rooftops and mandate the installation of photovoltaics, similar to how they can mandate the installation of streetlights on the walls.\n\n* **Routing around regulations.** If you have no close neighbors, it is  much simpler to ignore regulation because there is nobody who will complain to the authorities. Also, try to break only rules for the inside, not in relation to the outside environment. Then, the problem only arises when you want to sell the building \u2013 then an architect will have to check what has to be changed for that to be possible. So that will be the time to undo ones hacks and changes \u2013 and when keeping the house, it will never be a problem.\n\n* **Combining houses in the city.** Buying adjacent houses and making them into a single house by knocking down walls is prohibited in Brussels. But you could just do it, and put up the walls again when moving out :slight_smile: \n\n* **Dealing with fire safety.** In cities, public and communal spaces are tightly supervised by the fire brigade. They may mandate the type and material of walls, fire protection doors etc. to isolate buildings against each other so that there is a safety window for people in one part if another part catches on fire. For example, staircases in large buildings will have to be isolated from a kitchen space with a fire safety door.\n\n* **Non-financial return on green investments.** It can be that a change of technology towards greener, lower-consumption solutions will not pay for itself over its lifetime in financial terms, but still be worth doing it because of the environmental benefits. For example, a rainwater system may not pay for itself from the freshwater costs it saves, but it helps to prevent groundwater overuse (esp. in the drought years, which will be more frequent in the future climate). Similarly, replacing a car with an electric version may not pay financially for the car's owner, but may still be worth doing. (Open question: Are there frameworks to evaluate what is worth doing even though it's a financial \"loss\"? Or lists of such interventions?)\n\n* **The off-grid neighborhoods of Nice (?).** After the last economic crisis, some poor neighborhoods near Nice broke off all grid connections to the city, and manage their own water, wastewater and electricity now. This is interesting because it shows how off-grid solutions can also work for the poor, instead of being a thing to play for the rich. [see: 3:29:57]\n\n* **Certification issues with material re-use.** Any certified component of a building is not legal to be put to use again in a new building. The certification only applied when that equipment was installed the first time, but now the standards might be different and not cover these items anymore for getting a new building certified. For example, emergency lamps. All these items are now considered waste. It especially also applied to electronics components.\n\n* **Right to Repair and its limits.** In Europe, we got the \"right to repair\" legislation a few months ago. It is a good basis for more resource efficient living, as in principle it allows DIY repairs to household appliances etc.. However in practice, many manufacturers cite \"safety concerns\" to prevent consumers from getting their hands on their repair manuals, and provide them only to certified professionals.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--4\">4. The role of lifestyle and behaviors</h2>\n\n* **Consumption is 80% of the problem, construction 20%.** The energy costs of constructing a house is 20% of its total lifetime energy costs, while the energy use during its lifetime is 80%. That says something about priorities for \"greening\" city living!\n\n* **No-plastic living.** Have a (communally researched) list of local purchase options etc. for no-plastic-packaging food etc.. Share your grocery shopping \u2013 that is needed to be able to get items plastic free, as these shops might be further away, or sell in larger quantities.\n\n* **Low-hanging fruits of green urban living.** These are: not having a car, shorter commutes, lower heating costs as houses are in blocks.\n\n* **Greening the lifestyle of the whole neighborhood.** By integrating social projects such as clothing exchange events and rescued food distribution, a community can make the living in the whole local area more green, not just its own. It would be interesting to do the numbers for that, and it may turn out to be the most efficient way of emission reduction. From Bernardo's experience, a best practice to do these social service projects is to do those that also profit yourself, because then it's not a net drain on the organizer: if you have kids, organize kids clothes exchange events; if you cycle, organize a cycle repair workshop; if you like dancing or working out, offer dance classes or open a gym in the communal space.\n\n    These can also be semi-commercial activities and still be a net benefit for the neighborhood. It provides a public good because of \"zero marginal cost\": scaling the service up to more people beyond ones own and direct community's needs does not really cost more, so can be provided as a service at a low price or even for free.\n\n* **Use rescued food as much as possible.** That's a major aspect of greener living that is possible in community, and less possible in small households. Because with more people, larger amounts of rescued food can be utilized, with a large commercial kitchen food can also be preserved easily etc.. On top, rescued food can be shared in the neighborhood, which makes urban living greener even for *others*.\n\n* **How to make communal living attractive to the middle class?** They don't have a need to share space, because they can afford not to. They don't have a need to change their lifestyle to be greener. How to motivate them to engage in green communal living then?\n\n    Another position on that is that some middle class people would like to live communally (\"Being a migrant and living as a couple in an own flat in a new city sucks. People don't want to do that.\"). And that this need is not served by the market (constructing single-family homes), including banks (funding single-family homes). It's hard to find a large house with multiple bathrooms, for example. \n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--5\">5. About communal living in more general</h2>\n\n* **Children-friendly architecture.** Architecture that looks at the built environment also from a child's perspective is rare \u2013 often, windows are too high for them to look out, for example. If you are going to convert a space anyway, why not include that perspective. It may help community members to stay after having children, or even influence their decision to have children or not.\n\n* **Unsupervised child play.** In a communal space that is somehow enclosed (not like a gated community, but a bit \u2026), unsupervised play is simple, even in today's age and in cities. Children can become quite self-sufficient \u2013 @alberto mentioned how in such a neighborhood in Milano, the children made all the adults keep their doors unlocked so the kids could go in and out of the houses of their friends to get water, go to the toilet, meet their friends etc.. It made the environment more social for everyone, and is more efficient regarding adult attention. It's not directly \"green\", but frees up precious time for other activities, including for those that take more time but less other resources and are thus part of \"green living\". It also lowers the need to move children around in a car between activities.\n\n* **Provision for children activities at home.** \"Do you really need your children be driven to karate and back? Make them a football place in the courtyard instead.\" And similar approaches. It uses less energy for transport, and it frees up adult time for other aspects of a greener lifestyle, which is often more time-consuming.\n\n* **Add a garage!** A large, 4.50 m high garage is a very handy, multi-purpose space to include in a communal living setup. Can be used to house nomads coming with their van or truck, to host parties, to store stuff etc..\n\n* **Social housing is not communal \u2013 but should be.** All social housing is subdivided into family-sized homes, without any communal spaces that are shared with others. (\"Because communal space is public space, and public space tends to be aggressive to individuals with low income, mental or health issues etc., on the basis that people from different backgrounds cannot relate to them, and cannot profit from them.\") Still, there is a large need in such social housing situations for shared spaces, out of economic necessity: social housing is precarious, it means small houses shared with many people. Shared spaces would make comforts of a middle-class lifestyle available to lower-income people. This need was served by projects in Brussels like Cent-vingt-trois (see below).\n\n* **Dealing with problems, not avoiding problems.** Problems \u2013 mostly the social ones \u2013 will happen in communal living. It's not so much about avoiding them, rather about building a community that can deal with them. An important point for that is that community members must have time to invest in building the community and its communal spaces and collaborations in the neighborhood \u2013 instead of working for money to pay the rent. A cheap rent per person is crucial for that. Because \"how do you build a community when you arrive at 18:00 in the evening?\" That lack of time would result in unresolved tensions in the community.", "created_at": "2019-11-24 02:29:19.338157", "updated_at": "2019-12-25 21:14:59.189110", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 3910, "wiki": true, "reads": 16, "score": 103.2, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2551, 3, 4, 5201, 2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 63450, "user_id": 3703, "topic_id": 11368, "post_number": 18, "raw": "@HadeerGhareeb sent by private message :)", "created_at": "2019-11-08 09:22:22.207105", "updated_at": "2019-11-08 09:22:22.207105", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 5, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 22.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [63308], "is_liked_by": [3782], "is_private": false}, {"id": 65489, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 11774, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Welcome @anas_89 anas !  \n\nPing @Sohayeb", "created_at": "2019-11-24 02:25:54.577365", "updated_at": "2019-11-24 02:25:54.577365", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 5, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29500, "user_id": 2410, "topic_id": 3945, "post_number": 16, "raw": "<b>Assembly page posted on c3</b>\n\nhttps://events.ccc.de/congress/2014/wiki/Assembly:Edgeryders\n\nIf in doubt, check everything, I was rather liberal in my interpretation of intent and my rewording.

This \"feeling the obligation\" is what I'm talking about above. And it's a fuzzy sense of obligation: How much other work is needed to offset for not volunteering in the kitchen? There is never a proper sense of what is enough, and this ruins the experience. (Subjectively, and of course there will be people less susceptible to such social pressures and the informal system will work just fine for them. But that's not everyone.)\n\n[quote=\"hazem, post:10, topic:8068\"]I am a bit skeptical of finding one solution to fit all houses as people behaviour and habits are different so each group setting finds its own way.... May be that's why informal knowledge is hardly documented?[/quote]\n\nI think I agree that there's no \"one size fits all\". OpenVillage Houses can be anything between a flat-sharing community and a large commune, and settings differ between those where nearly all common work is construction (say, if we had one of the abandoned houses in this area) and where nearly all common work is household maintenance (city life, e.g. as in Reef Brussels, where the informal way of organizing seems to work fine). It will also depend on size: small flat-sharing setups (\u22645 people?) will probably naturally be organized \"home-like\" (informally), while larger setups may need more structure.\n\nBut that does not mean that we can't find \"The Solution\". There is overlap between what works in different settings, and expertise of developing something for a new setting. So it sounds like [design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pattern_Language) would be a proper way to structure and document \"The Solution\" as something to mix and match for different settings.\n\nAnd lastly:\n\n[quote=\"alberto, post:11, topic:8068\"][T]he worst solution would be a massive debate about whether dirty cups in the sink are good or bad. Because these debates also consume processing power, and they have a potential for controversy and dreariness.[/quote]\n\nOf course. These are not really important issues. Which is why I'd never discuss this stuff had you not offered to start this high-level discussion because \"it's an interesting issue to analyze\". Having this discussion won't pay off for the Sidi Kaouki House, which makes your point about time cost valid. But there is also the bigger picture of us wanting to find re-usable solutions, of wanting to solve an issue \"once and for all time\". So within the whole OpenVillage Solutions ecosystem, this discussion may still pay off, if it all comes together as I hope it will \u2026", "created_at": "2018-02-13 13:18:10.441665", "updated_at": "2018-02-13 13:30:23.191423", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 561, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 73.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 3, "quotes_posts": [41770, 41754, 41765], "is_reply_to": [41770, 41754, 41765], "is_liked_by": [3811, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 54772, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 9821, "post_number": 72, "raw": "Maybe we could start with a scheduled community call on the topic?

How do you Edgeryders feel since you apparently use it day to day? \n\n\nIncluding @hugi here as we started talking about this briefly.\n\n\nOn communities, I'll dive into the Academy course for community management when I have time (btw I can't seem to be able to scroll pages and click on videos when using my Android mobile)!\n... also slowly making my way through the huuuge amount of content of this forum!", "created_at": "2018-08-16 11:26:44.531537", "updated_at": "2018-08-16 11:29:05.540456", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 488, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 102.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2915, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32204, "user_id": 100, "topic_id": 1276, "post_number": 27, "raw": "<b>L'Homme du Kundalini</b>\n\nLyne, j'appr\u00e9cie que tu ais fait la liste de qualit\u00e9s de l'Homme du Kundalini.

Both newsletters will aim to be a guiding and reliable voice, making sense of a chaotic world. Their purposes differ, however.\n\n* **The first newsletter will be for the Edgeryders community and it will be published each week on our internal platform**\n  * The aim of this newsletter is to **synthesize the information that has been discussed in the previous week** and store it in one place so that Edgeryders\u2019 community can quickly access posts, and be alerted to something they may have missed. For those who are \u2018time poor\u2019 it will become a good resource that they return to each week to check in with the community. By doing this Edgeryders wishes to increase engagement with its members.\n  * It will give an overview of the topics discussed on the platform each week and weave them together in a **central theme**.\n  * It will have **a hook** - much like previous newsletters - that focuses on something happening in the world that week and it will show how Edgeryders\u2019 members have discussed it or tried to make sense of that event through linking to conversations.\n  * It will include a **link back to the [Status Report II](https://edgeryders.eu/t/status-report-ii-whats-up-with-you/13292/135) page** which is a safe place where the Edgeryders community gets to know each other, share what\u2019s happening in their lives and around them in their part of the world.\n\n* **The second newsletter will be distributed externally (via social media channels etc) and it will be published fortnightly.**\n  * This newsletter will be called \u201cResilience and Regeneration\u201d \n  * Each issue of the newsletter will focus on a different category of Edgeryders work, which we have broken into as follows:\n    * **Better work**, coworking, remote and distributed working, jobs and prosperity\n    * **The green transition** - Earth OS\u2019 work on climate and environment - will include economic regeneration needed around the climate emergency\n    * **Wellbeing** - which will tie into Wellbeing in Europe and Proprebol\nFrom previous newsletters we realise that topics that are more niche seem to tap into a certain demograph online, which in turn, can attract attention and interestng people to future events and the platform.\n\n  * It\u2019s purpose is to **attract more people** to the platform and to **help develop business**\n  * It will either speak about an **upcoming event** or focus on an **event that has already taken place** (Eg the posts on the coworking event and the one coming this week on Messina)\n  * Again, it will be a voice of authority, stewarding conversations that are happening in the space of that week\u2019s focus and Edgeryders\u2019 upcoming events. It\u2019s high quality will give it credibility\n  * Because this is a series, each newsletter will weave together to **create a longer discussion** that slots together to show the journey in thought as we **make sense of global events** on the platform and **create new solutions and projects**\n\nI'm interested to hear what other people think will work and if you have any other ideas etc. that we could try.", "created_at": "2020-09-16 14:02:28.208218", "updated_at": "2020-09-17 10:22:36.558295", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 532, "wiki": false, "reads": 23, "score": 104.6, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 2915, 6670], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2683, "user_id": 1890, "topic_id": 2650, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hi all, I'm new to edgeryders but very excited about spot the future. <span>\u00a0I am a big fan of\u00a0getting stuff done through networks of active citizens rather than organizational hierarchies of people telling one another what to do. \u00a0This is ironic as I work for<span> UNDP</span> in<span> Armenia.</span> \u00a0But the more I <a href=\"http://issuu.com/georgehodge/docs/sicamp_toolkit\">work with non-contractibles</a>, the more I am becoing non-contractible.</span>\n\n", "created_at": "2014-03-21 11:32:31", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:14.180439", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 118, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31, "user_id": 4922, "topic_id": 25, "post_number": 1, "raw": "We build a meaningful, productive and enjoyable work-and-life environment.

We need to be mission driven, and stay for long (Mazzucato). \n\nThis initiative aims to develop sustainable, and hopefully profitable paths towards reaching our goal. The Edgeryders community and organisation are uniquely positioned to build it because of the track record of the people driving it. And the fact that we are already generating revenue, have zero debt and a thriving community of >4000 talented, committed people in 80+ countries. With your participation we can get there faster and better. \n\n**Why three different names? Are they different projects?**\n\n* The OpenVillage is a comprehensive set of open tech solutions and collective action strung together by a common narrative. \n\n* Edgeryders is a collective intelligence platform for building the OpenVillage. \n\n* The Reef is our terrain for deep prototyping of the technologies, culture and new forms of human organising that will go into the OpenVillage\n\nThe OpenVillage House run by Edgeryders (The Reef) consists of:\n\n**A live-work space where we experiment with different solutions and develop the non-technical competences needed to use them effectively.** Instead of doing a 2 week prototype, we run as we live with it, and keep tweaking it over time until it works. The stuff that stays with us will be included in the openvillage. ICOs for real estate, Robots, smart clothing, furniture, new forms of organising, art. It will be sustainable because people need a place to live and organisations need a place to work - revenue will come from rent of residential spaces in a unique setting amenable to personal and professional development. \n\n**A Business network consists of people and organisations who wish to be close to where the action is.** Edgeryders is already a place to access and nurture a unique stream of open innovation. Hand-held echostethoscopes that cost a fraction of what is on the market.  Cheap coffee bean sorting machines. Mechanical arms to rotate and increase yield from solar panels. New assistive and medical devices and open source insulin. As part of the business network you can interact with us, get news from the edge and be part of it even if you cannot live with us. \n\n**These innovations are open source, and they are accessible, but their use is restricted by different licenses issued by the innovators.** When an idea or product under development is of interest to commercial companies **The Reef can broker a deal in which the innovator can give different additional rights of use with a contract. This protects both parties against abuses.** The business model is the one employed by opencorporates.com and thenounproject.com - pay to wave right to be named as author and in the latter case, gain access to the original design file.  \n\n**An Annual Festival and series of events gathering the community building the openvillage and the business network around it**. The festival happens not in an anonymous conference room, but in the live-work space located where the openvillage is being built. It presents the new knowledge, artefacts and ideas coming out of The Reef, draws more participants and grows the ecosystem. It acts as a heartbeat that gives a steady rhythm to the work of building the openvillage over 10 years, grows the community and celebrates the achievements that come out of it.  \n\n**How Edgeryders finances this and generates income for the community involved in it**\n\nWe build it as a viable business with multiple sources of revenue.  It makes sense to build the Reef as a new company because this enables us to capture, align and channel all the externalities generated by the live-work space, business network and festival towards growing and strengthening the venture. The model is infinitely scalable: our online platform, digitial technologies and scientifically rigorous methodology enable us to cost-effectively scale and the remote membership. We have a couple of ideas for non-extractive and ethically sound business models with opportunities for personal and professional development that draw a steady stream of talented individuals. And we will design an appropriate governance model that balances the needs of the community with that of the people who take personal responsibility and invest huge amounts of time that is needed to get the company up, and keep it running well.\n\nOur world-class community building and management expertise make The Reef a safe and welcoming space that draws and maintains the diversity required for deep innovation. \n\n**If the model catches on people will show up at our doorstep and say this is great, how can I do it in location x**? Then we can move in and franchise the venture complete with a populated online platform and activities (which is the hardest thing to do- almost no one manages to get this right). Clients can pay us to help them set up their own Reef around a specific field e.g. healthcare. A person with a great network approaches us saying \u201cI really want to build one of these in my city\u201d; \u201cwe say great! You\u2019re hired!\u201d And they manage the setting up of a new company owned by the Reef.\n\n**This is already happening.** It happened with the unMonastery -as soon as the Edgeryders community started exploring the idea, the city of Matera asked us to run, and paid for, the first prototype. The project gained unsolicited coverage from international and local media (The Nation, New York Times, Il Sole 24 ore, Wired Germany etc etc), speaking engagements at large public events etc. The World Bank has commissioned us to implement a version in the MENA region as a place based social innovation incubator. \n\n**We envision a network of Reef localities in every city bound together by an online platform which acts as a collective intelligence engine and extends the reach and scale of the model.** And we are on the way. The first one was set up in Brussels in March of 2017. A second locality is now under development and with your help, will be up and running in Morocco by 2018. The online platform is already up and running (you are on it right now) and populated by a thriving community that spans the globe.\n\n**By joining us early in the game you get a unique opportunity to shape your own involvement and the company as a whole**. We are designing a multiplicity of ways to participate at different levels of commitment- from accessing newsletters all the way to partnering with us around new ventures e.g. large R&D projects which generate new commercial opportunities e.g OpenCare. \n\nLearn more about membership    Become a member\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n**Where are we are going with this?** A future to look forward to, collaborating freely in the quest for prosperous, lives full of meaning, love and respect in tight knit yet open groups. It's not about becoming reclusive tribes, nor is it about rejecting technology. We want to connect with one another, and with the world at large. To be well with ourselves and with one another. To thrive when failing institutions or existing large-scale centralised means of securing a good life no longer can be relied on.\n\n**How will we get there?** We have a long-term map of different components needed in a good life. For most of us, accessing several of them through existing means is difficult or impossible. At least if you look to what is available in the mainstream where power and resources are concentrated. You need to venture out to the edges where people are experimenting with all kinds of solutions for building thriving individuals, communities and societies. So we look for open source solutions and replicable efforts to satisfy our needs and work to make them accessible to a more people.\n\nOn the new online platform we reach out to and connect people working on current issues and encourage them to share their stories, leave thoughtful reflections on the stories of others' and respond to others' comments on their own. We use community management and software to transform thousands of conversations into shared knowledge and concepts for how participants' existing work can be connected to achieve impact at scale. Knowledge gained from hands-on practical experiences is transformed into wisdom powered by Collective Intelligence.\n\n**Which themes and topics will you cover?** We have a map of all the components of a well-functioning life and community based on consultation with people in over 200 cities. We convene conversations around one priority to focus enough energy and resources to move beyond *talking*. Right now it's how we sustainably care for one another's health: physical, social, mental and emotional.\n\n**How can I bring this to my own community or geographic location?** We support members to host events in different locations where participants meet in person, get to know one another and build big exciting ideas around which collaborate. People who participate in this process gain access to valuable information, new perspectives, and a huge network of contacts who can help unlock new opportunities for them. They understand where there are efficiencies to be gained, mistakes to avoid and skills to be developed. Individual changemakers use this collective intelligence to help them move their own efforts forward.\n\n**Why should different people and organisations partner with this initiative?** Allies have access to new initiatives as they are being born and can get involved at an early stage. Existing projects and their business/sustainability plan are documented in a standard format then posted on the community for further development. Participants are free to use and modify them under condition that attribution is given to everyone else who has contributed to its development so far, and that they have contributed something time or money to the project.\n\n**How can I meet and get involved in the global community?** You can participate in our annual community gathering that is build by community members, for community members. The objective of these events is to 1) build a holistic, shared understanding of the topic at hand 2) demo a credible systems level solution made of interoperable, smaller scale projects 3) use the evidence-backed vision and impact strategy to generate backing (attention, skills and time) for participants\u2019 projects. \n\n**How can people deploy and maintain their own OpenVillage house?** Participants will collaboratively deploy one instance of each selected project within the Reef to serve as collective learning opportunity and demo of what is possible. We then support those who participated in setting up the first instance, to do the same in their own local context.\n\n**How will we know when the vision is achieved?** Over time we build a full set of connected techniques, knowledge, relationships and culture that supplies everything needed for long term healthy, sustainable and enjoyable living. We have become a critical mass of people who have developed the skills, infrastructure and resources needed to build and sustain ourselves. And have made many new friends along the way :)\n\n**Why Edgeryders?** What sets Edgeryders apart is that we actually have the tools, methodology and organisational capacity to turn the participants\u2019 \"talking\" into collective intelligence and action. \n\n**I want to be a part of this, but I already have a demanding project which I don\u2019t want to give up- is there some way I can participate anyway?** The process is structured in a way that doesn't require participants to give up what they are already doing or join someone else's project. It is designed to work both for people who wish to work on location, as well as those who wish to participate remotely. The not for profit organisation stewarding the process uses revenue from commercial work to finance the long-term coordination work needed to make this all possible.\n\n\n**How can I support this initiative?** Come talk to us so we can pick a task that works for you. If you prefer to contribute money to help offset costs you can talk to us about how we can do this without compromising the integrity of this community driven initiative.

building better lives for ourselves** \n\nWhere we are going: A future to look forward to, collaborating freely in the quest for prosperous, lives full of meaning, love and respect in tight knit groups. It's not about becoming reclusive tribes, nor is it about rejecting technology. We want to connect with one another, and with the world at large. To be well with ourselves and with one another. To thrive when failing institutions or existing large-scale centralised means of securing a good life no longer can be relied on.\n\nHow we get there: We have a long-term map of different components needed in a good life. For most of us, accessing several of them through existing means is difficult or impossible. At least if you look to  what is available in the mainstream where power and resources are concentrated. You need to venture out  to the edges where people are experimenting with all kinds of solutions for building thriving individuals, communities and societies. \n\nOn the new online platform we reach out to and connect people working on current issues and encourage them to share their stories, leave thoughtful reflections on the stories of others' and respond to others' comments on their own. We use community management and software to transform thousands of conversations into shared knowledge and concepts for how participants' existing work can be connected to achieve impact at scale. Knowledge gained from hands-on practical experiences is transformed into wisdom powered by Collective Intelligence. \n\nWe convene conversations around one priority area at a time. Right now it's [how we sustainably care for one another's health: physical, mental and emotional](https://edgeryders.eu/t/introducing-open-care/33).  \n\nWe support members to host events in different locations where participants meet in person, get to know one another and build big exciting ideas around which collaborate. People who participate in this process gain access to valuable information, new perspectives, and a huge network of contacts who can help unlock new opportunities for them. They understand where there are efficiencies to be gained, mistakes to avoid and skills to be developed. Individual changemakers use this collective intelligence to help them move their own efforts forward. \n\nAllies have access to new initiatives as they are being born and can get involved at an early stage. Existing projects and their business/sustainability plan are documented in a standard format then posted on the community for further development. Participants are free to use and modify them under condition that attribution is given to everyone else who has contributed to its development so far, and that they have contributed something time or money to the project.\n\nWe collaboratively build an annual Festival. The objective of these events is to 1) build a hollistic, shared understanding of the topic at hand  2) demo a credible systems level solution made of interoperable, smaller scale projects 3) use the evidence-backed vision and impact strategy to generate backing (attention, skills and time) for participant\u2019s projects. \nDeployment and maintenance. Participants will collaboratively deploy one instance of each selected project within our own  open village  to serve as collective learning opportunity and demo of what is possible. We then support those who participated in setting up the first instance, to do the same in their own local context. \n\nOver time we build a full set of connected techniques, knowledge, relationships and culture that supplies everything needed for long term healthy, sustainable and enjoyable living. We have become a critical mass of people who have developed the skills, infrastructure and resources needed to build and sustain ourselves. And have made many new friends along the way :)  \n\nWhat sets Edgeryders apart is that we actually have the tools, methodology and organisational capacity to turn the participants\u2019s \"talking\"  into collective intelligence and action. The process is structured in a way that doesn't require participants to give up what they are already doing or \"join someone else's project. It is designed to work both for people who wish to work on location, as well as those who wish to participate remotely. The not for profit organisation stewarding the process uses revenue from commercial work to finance the long-term coordination work needed to make this all possible.\n\nHow we are getting there and how one can contribute: a number of challenges that are \"constant\", and what you see on arrival. We start with what our ideal situation is (how life is in the  open village) and then reverse engineer it. How did that happen? What came before that? And before that? These become our milestones around which the challenges are shaped and a growing community convened. \n\nWriting our shared story in the the future, backwards.\n\n\n## **Le village ouvert : Faisant du bien en construisant une vie meilleure pour nous-m\u00eames**\n\nUne initiative pour promouvoir la jeunesse et l\u2019employabilit\u00e9  en  Moyen-Orient  et en Afrique  du nord .\n\nNotre destination (ou allons-nous ?) : Vers un avenir qu\u2019on contemple ensemble.

And what skills will we need that we don't have, and need to invest in learning?\n\nWe'll need more than hope and courage if we want to rise to the scale of the challenge facing us - we'll need to invest in specific skills, and learn to use an expanded vocabulary that includes concepts related to climate, carbon, and equity.\n\nJoin our workshop in Berlin on Friday 29th to figure out what service design might look like in world of net-zero, and identify what we'll need to know as professionals to get there.\n\n### A summary article, also not more than 150 -200 words combining the insights/overview and good quotes from theses sources:\n\n* [How do we weave together the threads of various conversations we are having around a \u201cdeep green\u201d transition, and what are our next steps?](https://edgeryders.eu/t/how-do-we-weave-together-the-threads-of-various-conversations-we-are-having-around-a-deep-green-transition-and-what-are-our-next-steps/10775)\n\n* https://edgeryders.eu/t/living-greener-as-therapy-how-i-stumbled-upon-plasticless-trees-and-diy-protein/11396/3\n\n* Best of article #3\n\n### 3 quote banners: Visual Materials here.\n\n* **What do digital services in a world of net-zero look like ? https://edgeryders.eu/t/workshop-on-service-design-in-a-climate-emergency-what-do-digital-services-in-a-world-of-net-zero-look-like/11070** \" It\u2019s also relatively simple to shift from measuring cost in money to cost in carbon.For example the [Office of National Statistics in the UK already measures things like carbon intensity for different sectors](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/bulletins/greenhousegasintensityprovisionalestimatesuk/2017), to have proxy figures for CO2 emissions.If by law you are compelling to reduce emissions, and you know that expenditure in a given sector emits a set about of emissions for every 10k of spend, you have implicit budgets already set. There\u2019s a danger in this approach, that we end up leaving great swathes of people behind - while this approach is easy to measure and manage, it\u2019s also a very blunt instrument, especially when within industry, we know that our knowledge about how to do almost anything in a measurably low carbon way* is so poor.\"\n\n* **What do digital services in a world of net-zero look like ? https://edgeryders.eu/t/workshop-on-service-design-in-a-climate-emergency-what-do-digital-services-in-a-world-of-net-zero-look-like/11070**\n\n\u201cAlso, while user-centred design is increasingly common, we have few tools for designing for people who are not the *primary* users of services, a key consideration when designing for the wider environment. For example, Airbnb is a great example of user-centred design for the end user. It\u2019s a less successful example of design for the neighbour of a person hosting an apartment, or less visible people, like the cleaners and other workers who are also part of the supply chain\u2026\u201d\n\n* **What do digital services in a world of net-zero look like? https://edgeryders.eu/t/workshop-on-service-design-in-a-climate-emergency-what-do-digital-services-in-a-world-of-net-zero-look-like/11070** This would help understand which questions the tools and frameworks we have available are suited to answering, which ones they aren\u2019t. Being able to check these common tools we know against the key challenges identified in the first output would let give us an idea of what new tools might look like.\n\n### 3 Call-to-action Status updates: Visual Materials here.\n\n*Which skills would we like to have in the room?*\n\n* Service design skills, particularly working in public sector in Europe, and private sector\n\n* Policy design and experience, particularly for delivering carbon reductions in government services\n\n* Digital skills, for implementing digitally mediated aspects of a service, like building digital platforms designed to support a channel shift away from manual ones that relied on paper\n\n* Skills and experience at working with vulnerable groups (or people from those groups themselves), often impacted by the unintended consequences of people taking steps to \u2018green\u2019 a service.\n\n*Are there specific organisations whose contributions would be helpful?*\n\n* Do you know service designer who has experience facilitating events? Send them to us for a gig\n\n* Do you know anyone at TU Berlin who is working on \u201csustainable digitalisation\u201d?\n\n* Do you know anyone from who has experience working with groups who are often vulnerable, and marginalised? Come join us at this workshop\n\n* Know anyone who is helping organisations understand how their efforts might unintentionally harm the people they are trying to help?\n\n* Do you know anyone who is building digital services that displace more polluting alternatives? Can you talk about the trade-offs you have to make when operating commercially?\n\n* Do you know anyone who is working at a mobility services company like Coup, Emmy etc. Join us!", "created_at": "2019-11-08 09:25:18.475055", "updated_at": "2019-11-19 14:53:50.945464", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 992, "wiki": true, "reads": 21, "score": 9.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11742, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 5061, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Format and people forget</b>\n\nI think too many tasks at one time is overwhelming.

I am posting this in the Name of @RobvanKranenburg. Looking forward to all the creative and thoughtful ideas and comments of yours!\n\n > # Call for use cases ideas for Disposable Identities.\n\n# **The Need:**\n**The goal is to take back the power and control of your own identity and to keep big cooperations  and governments from profiting off of it.** We need a multistakeholder governance on identity with citizens in charge together with SME (small companies) and inclusive tools from democratic organizations. ([disposableidentity.com](http://disposableidentity.com/) and [disposableidentities.eu](http://disposableidentities.eu/) coming soon.)\n\n\n# **Who we are:**\n**We are developing a technical solution for the generation of disposable identities for \"normal users.\"** \n\n# **The Opportunity:**\n**We will reach out to the best use case idea's and use our resources and technical know-how to develop your idea into a serious pitch or call application.**\nYou own your use cases and ideas are theirs. We offer to help in making it into a pitch for a pitch, portfolio, investors or making it ready to apply for an [NGI.eu](http://ngi.eu/) call. The next step to realising your DID idea!\n\n# **The Call:**\n*We ask you for the use cases you can imagine for such DiD's.*\nSend your idea to Rob van Kranenburg at rob at [dyne.org](http://dyne.org/)\n\n\n# **About DID's:**\n\nThe idea is that from a DiD a person can generate a disposable (limited in time, in purpose and scope) identity for each separate service (for example one for rent, one for the energy company, one for the water company) that can only be seen, controlled and traced back by the DID owner and that one specific service. So no one can aggregate services, nor are you ever fully exposed as a person unless you decide to, because you just send token/credential \u2018enough money in the bank\u2019 to rent, water and energy company as they just need to know that you can pay, not who you are.\n\nCoding context: [zenroom.org](http://zenroom.org/)\n\n\n# How it works\n\n[Zenroom.org](http://zenroom.org/) allows you to get credentials from a CA, like for example \u201cI\u2019m above 18\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m Belgian\u201d and \u201ctoday I have more than 1000 EUR in my bank\u201d. Each credential is a crypto object, signed by the CA.\n\nEach time you want to use any of these credentials, they get anonymized, so if you use them twice, they don\u2019t look the same and can not be linked to each other and therefore not traced back to you.\n\n# Example Use Case:\nSo for example, if you need to access a service that requires you to be 18+ and Belgian, you\u2019d use those 2 anonymized credentials\u2026 the next day you use a different service that requires you to be 18+ and has 1000K EUR in your bank account, so you use those 2 other anonymized credentials: both times  **you effectively generated and used a disposable identity**, because only the CA could know who you are, but the services can only see that the CA signed the fact that you are Belgian, 18+ etc.\n\n# \n\n**Send your idea to Rob van.

Much, much less than say the \"groups of 5\" thing is.\n\nHere's how I would approach this in general:\n\n1. Orient yourself. \nAs @alberto likes to say: \"If you know how to look, you'll almost always **find someone already working on the problem** (or an adjacency - I might add) somewhere.\"\nI'll leave the \"knowing how to look\" part out of scope here, and will only mention that failed historic attempts can be hugely helpful here in my opinion.\nIf you've done this you should have an idea of who are some players in the domain, and you'll likely be able to tell pretty quickly that you want to be \"more like this, less like that\", \"the [well known brand / movement] of [well known issue], for [your less well known issue], \"if X and Y had a child\", \"X with a touch of Y\", or similar.\n2. Formulating your goals.\nI am not sure if it is always advisable to put your goals in writing. I think sometimes it is a must, and at other times it can be the first nail in the coffin. You'll have to decide yourself, and one option is to do it just for yourself privately. \nIn any case I **find that a shorthand for your aims or means**, like mentioned above, can work quite well if you understand where and how potential allies can latch onto you. Ambiguity is likely to work for in the early stage, but might cause problems later.\n3. Identify dominant dynamics in the field.\nWhat I mean here is for example that most of the players in the field of say the *world wide shipping industry* have their own set of motivations (incl. career paths), their views on history, and their own narratives about what future developments are plausible, probable, or likely. \nCompare this outlook to the *computing hardware, or computing software industry* and you'll see that this is going to be a crucial factor. \nAgain compare this with e.g. the *commercial aviation industry*, where safety and reputation are what most hours of most days are worked on more or less directly - with a currently pretty small competitive landscape. **Your approach must fit the dominant dynamics (though you'd likely best *not* aim at anything dominant, but a linchpin or [leverage point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_leverage_points))**. The best boiled down version of this I know is: [Dave Snowden's Cynefin](https://youtu.be/N7oz366X0-8?t=53)\nNote that [political alignments also vary drastically across occupations](http://verdantlabs.com/politics_of_professions/) and provide for interesting gradients and sub-groups that can be very fertile ground. \nAside: I believe even within pretty small groups you will see the social analogue to an [Helmholtz-Double Layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_layer_(surface_science)#Development_of_the_(interfacial)_double_layer) appear on the small scale (i.e. around a couple of hundred people). (@MariaEuler not sure if you've been down that wider [rabbit hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elective_Affinities#Theory) yet) \n\nGiven the above you may also want to reflect on if your project should go \"full steam ahead every day\" (something investors like to see), or e.g. \"lie dormant\" until the right opportunity presents itself - and perhaps how to switch from the former to the latter best.\n\nI haven't truly been part of the \"full steam ahead every day\" projects for a good time, and even when I was it was in a generally pretty tame environment (academic research) or I was going solo - so I'll take a pass on that. \n\nWhat I have more experience with is a \"steady remote job\" and \"advanced hobby level projects\". In my experience all of the above is **predicated on the people involved and their fit with the project and each other**. \n\nSo one of the most crucial factors is to get to know the people involved. An early face to face interaction in a range of somewhat edgy circumstances is perhaps the fastest and most reliable way to get a good idea on this. \nIn a \"slow\" approach you can first find the core team, and then expand it gradually through trusted contacts that get introduced one by one. This puts most \"information digestion stress\" on the new person, so I would strongly recommend a gradual introduction, providing them with context, background info to other people and their relationships and communication preferences. Perhaps also not \"throwing them at the team\" but making a few introductions first, maybe referring to some of those conversations when introduced to the wider team. \nIn a corporate environment I believe this is a process that should totally be flanked by HR and it is a testament to their overall uselessness that this is not the case (if only for the sake of HR gathering insights into internal dynamics). I strongly believe that something @alberto and Edgeryders are working on (a human readable scaling of conversations in scope and time) will become absolute boiler plate for any kind of ambitious onboarding program (aside: The first two weeks usually decide on your activity level and also largely how long a new employee will stick around eventually. It is ridiculous that this isn't even treated with so much as an afterthought at this point).\nShortly after a new person is introduced and starts really working with others there is a usually LOT of info the new person had to push through the channels a) to just establish reliable communication, and b) to push the right info at the right time, which is the reason for the person to be there in the first place. \nA proper [OKR-system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR) is expected to facilitate this in larger real world organizations, but I have seen fail pretty badly in several situations. My expectation is a combination of a social network analysis (who talks to whom, about what, when, through what means, and what is the typical escalation ladder + human commentary) and OKRs (actionable sub-goals) and a yet to be elaborated visual introduction round will have to be created.\nI say visual mostly because that is the information highway for our species, but that is not to say that vocalization nuances should not be considered important (my endless points about decent audio). Finally I think one part that is completely off the radar at the moment, but I think might be even more crucial than shared meals (I do this a lot via remote connection - and it is pretty cool) is: Smell, i.e. the olfactory dimension ([example paper](https://www.uni-kassel.de/fb4/psychologie/personal/euler/McBurney%20et%20al%20%20chapter%20Engen%20book%20REV%20FIN%20110908.pdf)) and perhaps even memory access (Proust effect). \n\nIn the short term though I think two things are easily actionable:\n1. Decent audio\n2. Use more of the screen (beside the face) to convey information. \nThis can be cues like people used at [occupy wall street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_movement_hand_signals) (where gallant efforts were made to scale convos!) - maybe slightly adapted.\nMost of that info should avoid text as it is too slow. Pictograms, or even simple photos of you and your background/biography/network defining environments can communicate long stories in seconds, and give good opportunities for tangential conversations. Little anecdotes will make you more memorable, but also risk putting you in a box - so perhaps keep em a little eccentric on purpose?\nIf you have what you are working on, maybe your time management / stack of \"to-dos\" color coded in the background - that can also convey current workload levels without much hassle, and at the same time allow people to offer to contribute. I haven't tried it myself, but I think I should at some time.\n3. Make sure you facial expressions can be seen. \nThis is perhaps more important in the beginning and for sensitive topics. If you are in a leadership role, I think it should be mandatory to show your face whenever you possibly can. At the very least have a placeholder image up, ideally one that reflects your mood or situation. \n4. In meetings with more than 3 people, have a chat channel up so people can make specific interventions without disruption. In meetings with more than 8 or so members consider having one member dedicated to servicing that chat channel. \n5. Structure meetings with a core part and a \"padding part\" before and after. \nTackle adjacent questions, connection issues, small talk, bio-breakes, seat swapping, etc. in the run-up, and use it to have extra time to onboard the new people. \nKeep some time after the core meeting for the people who might have detail questions of limited relevance. And again help the new people to ease the info stress on them, and allow them to ask \"dumb questions\" in a more private and work-time conscious way. \nIdeally **record the core part** of the meeting, and make a summary (action points, owners, dates) in the EXACT last 5 (or so) minutes. That will allow peripheral people to open the file, jump directly to the summary, and on that basis decide if they should review other sections of the meeting - in minimum time.\n6. Send out abundant optional invites. \nOptionals should understand that they are more in a listen / peripheral awareness role (can lurk without video, etc.) and should not hi-jack the core agenda unless invited to. Optionals can be included for awareness / info flow / redundancy, but also for vetting purposes. \nI think a good heuristic is when you send out enough invites that 20% of the attendees are optional on average. It is often better if you have 2 in one meeting, and none in the next - so don't worry too much about the details. Ideally an optional would listen to the previous meeting summary (perhaps during the padding time) if it was somehow related. The meeting host may decide to call an optional (invite via phone call) if he/she has not turned down the invitation.\n7. **Written notes are awesome** (and in many cases crucial), but should not detract focus off the matter at hand, especially if there are more than 4 people sacrificing their lifetime in a meeting. \nDedicated note takers should be praised (and scrutinized), and helped by improving the notes after the call, particularly with external links which can currently only really live in written notes.\n8. Simple organizational shortcuts can go a long way. \nFor example if ER had two **default times** for a) 80% general work focused calls, and b) calls for 80% socialization focus - then these could easily be used to e.g. reconnect with people you've met at a recent event. You just fire them one of the two zoom links and times, and ER can keep an ear on the grapevine while becoming more sticky to the general member environment - and allow serendipity into their living room. If it works too well, you just ask people to start a couple of breakout rooms. This way people can keep a far more emotional bond beyond the end of a event like e.g. the one in [Valencia](https://edgeryders.eu/t/draft-deep-dive-format-agenda-participants/10862) where I'd still have half a dozen smoking action points for example.\n9. Many \"Doers don't desktop\".\nTry using tools that will work on mobile. Also: Most business CEOs don't desktop, but travel a lot. Audio and a concise (but expandable - i.e. linked to primary information) note format win in this situation.  \n\nI'll try to write the next part about my thoughts on \"speed focused collaboration\" / hackathon style on site work.

Affordable:** Our approach uses very compact and affordable audio\nplayers (0.8 to 2 EUR) and allows spreading accurate, up to date, and\nappropriately customized information to a target audience that may be\nilliterate, struggling, and remote.\n**2. Minimal capex, custom opex:** There are no front heavy investments\nsuch as building, staffing, and attending of conventional schools.

Bootstraps out of a backpack:** It can be launched with minimal logistical\ndemands in a crisis situation with all relevant information pre-loaded\nand requires minimal management, because it is literally self-explaining.\n**4. Practical:** Importantly the devices are compact and robust enough to be\nused during housework, fieldwork, relief work, guarding, or menial tasks,\nand can even be operated by pre-school age children. Unlike broadcasts\nit can be re-listened, paused, and scheduled on demand. And unlike books do not\nlight or quietness, and sophisticated storage.\n**5. Data rich:** Being inherently digital this approach allows for transparency\nand accountability, with little risk of misuse. With minimal overhead it\nbecomes possible to improve or translate content locally and allow for\nextremely detailed two-way information flow, uninhibited by literacy\nbottlenecks.\nOnce these networks are established they can relay literal information\n(ebooks) with very few limitations.\n**6.

This is great, I'd love to talk to you about this further. One quick question though - have you experimented with different forms of participatory budgeting? I've been developing a few methods, and broadly I categorize participatory budgeting (PB) methods depending on whether they're open-ended or closed-ended:\n\nA closed PB system is one where funding, appropriation or other such aspects are decided beforehand or separately from the budgeting process. In such a system, the government might decide that there is a certain amount of money in the pot, and that PB can be done with that money, or something similar to that. In short, there are limitations on what can be budgeted, and the government takes care of raising funds. This generally leads to a loss of dynamic, \u00a0but is substantially simpler than an open system.\n\nAn open PB system is one where the citizens have to develop both the budget and the appropriations model. This can be done either for a subset of a government's budget (with special appropriations), or the entire budget. The simplest way I can see to do this is have two separate steps in the budgeting process. The first being the step where projects are defined and money allocated to them, and then when that has been done, the citizen is taken to a second step where they need to adjust tax rates, based on an economic forecast, until the budget is balanced. If the budget does not balance - has a surplus or a deficit - the citizen can opt to go back and redo the budgeting round. It might be a hard-written rule that the buget may not be in a deficit, but a surplus is acceptable, or something like that. The statistics work out in such a way that if each individual proposes a balanced budget, then the worked average budget (based on weighted geometric average, which appears to be the most reasonable) will also be balanced, which is pretty neat.\n\n... I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-15 09:52:30", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:40.522415", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 359, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4301, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4268, "post_number": 1, "raw": "News:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>We have a reasonably solid draft of 2.1.

Each contributor posts as often as they like, as one (or several) characters of their choosing. \n\nNo starting point or setting for the creative process is provided. The only rule of participation is to follow the \u201cYes-And\u201d principle, in short to never shoot down another participants contribution but instead build upon it and transform it as one wishes. The large body of content amassed during these weeks forms our \u201cStory\u201d - a collective dream world based on the whims and ideas of the contributors. \n\nAnyone is welcome to apply to be a contributor, writers, artists, actors, playwrites, and others. We will select a group that we think will work well together. Apply below. \n\nPart two consist of a small group of people doing a semantic social network analysis on the previously amassed body of content. A semantic social network analysis (SSNA) is in short an ethnographic analysis that identify key concepts in the communication of a group, and then utilise network science to display it in a navigable concept map. This allow anyone without an in depth understanding of ethnography or experience from the specific group to quickly get a grasp of their concept structure and relational network. More info on SSNA here.\n\nPart three consist of a presentation of the resulting SSNA as an artwork in itself. The exact form of this will be decided by the resulting shape of the research but will probably include an navigable map visualising how concepts and narratives arise through the collective writing process, which can be explored and read in a non-linear fashion like a sort of abstracted collaborative hypertext metafiction. \n\nThe intent with this project is both to investigate digital means of collaborative creative processes with the hope to form unexpected synergies and serendipities, as well as to explore how instrumental scientific research and autotelic or \u201cpurposeless\u201d art can feedback and strengthen each other.\n\n_Please edit as you like_", "created_at": "2018-12-13 13:38:24.658745", "updated_at": "2018-12-13 13:38:51.685221", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 394, "wiki": true, "reads": 14, "score": 42.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [49433], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 65878, "user_id": 5083, "topic_id": 11940, "post_number": 1, "raw": "**I'd like to participate in [Teaching Teachers Open Source](https://edgeryders.eu/t/teaching-teachers-open-source/9881)**\n\n**(Q1/3) What makes life good for you?** Oh gee... flow, friendships, serendipity?

First, because people don't understand the language, or don't see it, or don't see the importance. One can say that this is curable by education. But there might also be something else, which is even more problematic. \u00a0\n\nWhen one economic system transitions into another one the metrics used to evaluate economic performance or value in the first system cease to work in the new one. \u00a0\n\nIt has been demonstrated that open source destroys value in capitalism, because it creates products that can be distributed at a very low price, because the commercialization of these products cannot be controlled using intellectual property, no monopoly is possible, and because open source innovation is very rapid and corporations cannot keep up with it. Classical businesses are put out of business when open source products invade their markets. This means loss of jobs, which is bad news if you look at it from the perspective of the old economic paradigm. How can a politician advocate open source when he must also admit that it contributes to job loss? The reality is that in parallel we have more and more freelance work and the emergence of peer production. New work opportunities are created, with the possibility to be financially rewarded, but these are not jobs, and no one knows how they balance each other, if we have a net gain or a net loss. \u00a0This is not the type of stuff a politician can easily put in one phrase to mesmerize everyone.\u00a0\n\nSo how can we frame the debate. How can we convince people to make a risky choice, to pick a new system that has not been proven yet, but that has the characteristic to accelerate the demise of the old system, which still feeds them? Tough choice to make... The risky alternative becomes attractive only if we are at on edge of the precipice.

Mi vam ne mo\u017eemo obe\u0107ati da \u0107e re\u0161iti bilo koje problem o kojima pri\u010daju Evropski populisti dana\u0161njice. Ovo je za sve nas, bez obzira da li se sla\u017eemo sa populisti\u010dkim argumentima, da podignemo nivo svesti, podelimo jedni sa drugima informacije i iskustva o tome kako se mi, kao zajednica, nosimo sa tim stvarima.\n9. Imajte na umu \u010dinjenicu da smo mi raznolika zajednica. Ovo je od presudne va\u017enosti: skoro sve \u0161to mo\u017eemo posti\u0107i se zasniva na toj raznolikosti. Jako je va\u017eno da ostanemo otvoreni prema svim vrstama ljudi, saznanja I ve\u0161tina. Ovo zna\u010di da mi prihvatamo i uzimamo u obzir da svaka osoba treba da ima izbor na koji na\u010din i u kolikoj meri \u017eeli u\u010destvovati, dok god to ne ograni\u010dava autonomiju drugih.\n10. Onaj koji odradjuje posao donosi odluke. Fokus svake interakcije bi trebalo biti da osna\u017eimo i ohrabrimo svakog od nas da delujemo, umesto da sedimo sa strane i govorimo drugima da ne deluju. Doprinesite smi\u0161ljenim predlozima ako \u017eelite ne\u0161to napraviti boljim. Predlozi sa najvi\u0161e \u0161anse za implementaciju su oni uz koje ide i ponuda da se konkretno pomogne od strane onih koji ih predla\u017eu.\n11.

Nor is it about belonging on not to an expert group or a particularly line of utilitarian practice. The key starting point, at least for me, is an ontological one - related to the nature of our universe and rooted in the observation that the future does not exist in graspable/phenomenal state as later than now but is or can \"be\" in the present as anticipation. This may seem like splitting hairs but it has fairly profound implications since it allows us to become more fluid and open to paradigmatically distinct epistemological avenues for how we then think about ontologically different futures/anticipatory systems/processes.\u00a0 Sorry if this seems a bit too philosophical, but I think it is important since one of the main points is that by changing the way we use the future we can change the way we see the present, enabling a much less causal, planning, make-a-difference mindset to constrain our ability to make sense of the novel, heretofore incomprehensible emergent reality. This then enlarges the scope of improvisation and spontaneity, giving new ground for exploratory experimentation that is humble and rigorous at the same time.\n\nOkay, I'm going to stop for now. Have to run. But if there is an interest I can circulate some background material...\n\nHave a good one.\n\nRiel\n\n", "created_at": "2014-11-08 10:03:04", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:52.833227", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 331, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33905, "user_id": 3767, "topic_id": 6622, "post_number": 1, "raw": "In the last post we left you with a form and an invitation to share with us your opinion: the goal was to choose, among the 4 presented proposals, the most suitable sticker to identify the shops involved in open rampette project and the accessible shops in general.\n\nThroughout the dialogue with the shopkeepers and the final users what has recurrently emerged is the need for an effective communication. So the sticker has two different roles: it is a way to transfer the message clearly making the community more aware, but it is also a collective activation element to improve the accessibility experience in the city.\n\nWe received a lot of feedback, several positive comments, suggestions for improvement and also some critical advice, in particular regarding the two-color proposals, which may be confused with a prohibition sign because of the diagonal cut passing through the center of the circle.

Human-centric, check. Technical innovation, check. Social innovation, check. Are communities like these those we are supposed to engage in NGI Forward?\n[/quote]\n\nAbsolutely, I think you\u2019re spot on. Communities using and building things like Scuttlebutt (also known as SSB), DAT, IPFS, Beaker and Mastodon are a great starting point for exactly these reasons. These are the first groups I want to engage with. We have a huge reservoir of themes to draw upon that these communities are already discussing: resilience, environment, alternative energy, wellbeing, social issues, decentralized institutions for solidarity and many more. Through our good friends at Enspiral, we have direct access to the heart of the Scuttlebutt community as the main developer [Dominic Tarr](https://twitter.com/dominictarr) is from New Zealand, so it's a good place to start. \n\nSomeone made this map of how the user-base and culture of various social online technologies map on to the political compass. I don't know who the author is, and it is obviously to be taken with a pinch of salt, but there is some truth to it. It corresponds broadly to my own experience with these communities.\n\n![authoritarian-kwangmyong-stormfront-cubadebate-gab-ai-wechat-baidu-vkontakt-authoritarian-left-29889578|500x591](upload://rUQhhzsRidJ5AhQ1eADvZYEzjkm.png) \n\nEngaging the communities on the two libertarian quadrants to engage in the NGI conversation is crucial. To do so, we will need to give them incentives. Access to funding through calls, and some guidance for how to apply, is one incentive. Creating high-profile invite-only events that cater to their tastes is another. That said, there are smoother ways that invite-only to get to the right people, which is essentially to make the communication specific enough in flavour that only the right people understand why they should go. One event using this strategy is [Data Terra Nemo](https://dtn.is/), which I will be attending in May.\n\nAs a side-note, Scuttlebutt developer Dominic Tarr has quite the story to tell. He is an extremely productive author of open source libraries, and has written hundreds of modules that are being used all around the internet. He has never been paid a dime for this work, and gives the code away. Obviously, he can't maintain all this code, so when people come along to take over maintaining old modules he is has written ages ago, he is happy to hand over the reins. This created controversy as it was discovered that control over one of those modules had ended up in the hands of a thug who inserted malicious  code into an update, which was then pushed out to thousands of servers all around the internet. Its intended target was a single Bitcoin wallet platform called Copay which was using the module, and the perpetrator could then harvest account details of any account with more than 100 Bitcoin. Dominic caught a lot of flack for not doing due diligence on who he hands over code to, but [his response](https://gist.github.com/dominictarr/9fd9c1024c94592bc7268d36b8d83b3a) was that as long as companies are not paying maintainers of the modules they use or maintaining the modules themselves, they had themselves to blame.", "created_at": "2019-03-06 12:19:42.291349", "updated_at": "2019-03-06 14:31:41.030768", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 538, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 73.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [51400], "is_reply_to": [51400], "is_liked_by": [8, 5083], "is_private": false}, {"id": 80437, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 14088, "post_number": 1, "raw": "https://d1ehvogakajzfe.cloudfront.net/cmsAssets/articles/HowtoCode_hero.jpg?mtime=20181030144926\n\n# IMPORTANT NOTE: Please now document all bugs and function requests [on the GitHub](https://github.com/edgeryders/annotator_store-gem/milestone/1).

What functions do you need Open Ethnographer to have in the short-term?\n (Once added to Git Hub, please delete from here!) \n\n\n* The sort by UPDATED doesn't seem to be working as it should. For example I change the code's name, add a translation (thus updating it, I think) and it is not listed under updated. (@Wojt is this added to Git Hub? Just checking with you before I remove it here).  \n\n* Some newly assigned automatically merge with other codes of the same name assigned by other ethnographers, while others don't (the default, which is ideal, is for them not to automatically merge). (@Wojt same question as above)\n\n* Annotations featured in individual code page: when clicked, OE automatically displays the post including the coded annotation on top ONLY IF this post is in the first page. This means that annotations in later pages require ethnographers to click next, ctrl+F the annotation, and repeat this until the post is found.\n\n## Open Ethnographer Wishlist (in perceived order of difficulty)\n\n### Finding posts to code \n1. List of posts that have not been coded. \n\n### Coding for SSNA \n1. Toggle on/off in Open Ethnographer backend re appearance in SSNA \n2. Designate codes as \"pattern\" rather than semantic codes in backend (related to 1, but allows for a more granular categorisation of \"off\" codes). \n\n### Project-Level Coding\nBeing able to see everyone else\u2019s codes as suggestions on a project is great in theory. In practice, though, it means that when you select someone else\u2019s code, the annotation automatically falls under their code, and it becomes difficult to check that you meant the same thing as them.\n* **Long-term solution** : create colour-coded differentiation between ethnographers in the same project, so you can see whose code you are selecting in the drop-down.\n\n#### Airtable Medium-Term Request\n@amelia requests an import of our Sheets codebooks into the Open Ethnographer backend (code + code descriptions), and then a regular import of OE data into Airtable, which we will use as our codebook from now on (@hugi has set this up for BBU). This way we can work with the data as we create it, rather than using parallel processes which don't sync. Until we have a codebook in OE, this seems like the best medium-term solution. @danohu @matthias @hugi, can we do this as soon as possible/have a conversation about it? @alberto happy to update you as well.    \n\n### Codebook Integration \n\n1. Easily add and edit code definitions (the fewer clicks the better, ideally doable on main page with code list + definitions).\n2. Drag and drop hierarchical relationships (on main page).\n3. Ability to comment on each others\u2019 codes.\n\n### Annotation View\n\n1. Generate a list of annotations where the two concepts co-occur. Ability to generate a co-occurrence annotation list of all the annotations where two codes co-occur and/or where either of two codes occurs, but in the same post (so both intersection and union). This requires fixing two things: 1. not being able to assign multiple codes to a single highlighted text in one go. 2. Creating a way of generating this list.\n\n\n\n\n\n### List of Active Ethnographers:\nNGI: @CCS @Leonie @katejsim\nPOPREBEL: @Richard @Jan @Wojt @SZdenek @Jirka_Kocian\nPlato: @MariaEuler\nBBU: @hugi @jakobskote\nGlobal: @amelia @alberto \n\n(This will be a subsection of https://edgeryders.eu/t/open-ethnographer-manual/6811?u=amelia along with the https://edgeryders.eu/t/ethnographic-coding-wiki/13975?u=amelia)", "created_at": "2020-07-14 10:01:42.719615", "updated_at": "2020-08-24 16:44:45.377982", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 774, "wiki": true, "reads": 23, "score": 139.6, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5479, 4, 5, 6484, 3310, 5059], "is_private": false}, {"id": 58561, "user_id": 5123, "topic_id": 10640, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Super, ciesz\u0119 si\u0119. @ALaAl fajnie, \u017ce dzia\u0142asz z nami.", "created_at": "2019-08-29 11:40:09.713009", "updated_at": "2019-08-29 11:40:09.713009", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 9, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 37.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [58557], "is_liked_by": [3, 5277], "is_private": false}, {"id": 66241, "user_id": 5528, "topic_id": 11989, "post_number": 2, "raw": "@MariaEuler I have created the event page.

In normal text</h3>\n\nThe following code allows the user to click on the paragraph to see additional details unfolding. It only works with full paragraphs though, means you cannot embed the element inline into normal text.\n\nThe code can also be inserted from the Discourse editor by clicking the options button :gear: and then on \"Hide Details\".\n\nExample:\n\n```plaintext\n[details=\"spoiler alert\"]\nit's a **sled**\n\n> And there is a quote inside.\n[/details]\n```\n\nResult:\n\n[details=\"spoiler alert\"]\nit's a **sled**\n\n> And there is a quote inside.\n[/details]\n\nAs you see, further formatting of the hidden details is possible, including the use of code sections, quotes etc.. But formatting the summary text is not possible (it was, though, in a previous version of Discourse). If you require that functionality, please [use HTML to hide details](#heading--2).\n\nYou can separate the opening BBCode tag `[details=\"\u2026\"]`, the content and the closing tag `[/details]` with line breaks. Or you can put everything into a single line. You can not, however, mix these two techniques.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1-2\">1.2. In a quotation</h3>\n\nYou can use the \"Hide Details\" element inside a quotation section.\n\nExample:\n\n```plaintext\n> [details=\"spoiler alert\"]\n> it's a **sled**\n> [/details]\n```\n\nResult:\n\n> [details=\"spoiler alert\"]\n> it's a **sled**\n> [/details]\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1-3\">1.3. In list items</h3>\n\nYou can use the \"Hide Details\" element in list items. (It did not work properly in older versions of Discourse due to bugs, though.)\n\nExample:\n\n```\n* [details=\"Summary\"]\n  This text will be hidden\n  [/details]\n```\n\nResult:\n\n* [details=\"Summary\"]\n  This text will be hidden\n  [/details]\n\nThis is documented in much detail in \"[Formatting text content: 4. Details about lists](/t/-/6761#heading--4)\". Including templates for lists with multiple levels of folding.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1-4\">1.4. In tables</h3>\n\nIt not possible to use the \"Hide Details\" element in Markdown tables. The \"Hide Details\" BBCode tag can be used in HTML tables, but this is a buggy feature right now. Better [use HTML to hide details](#heading--2) in such a case.\n\nExample:\n\n```xml\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td>1</td>\n    <td>2</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>3</td>\n    <td>\n\n[details=\"4\"]\n5! 6! 7! \n8! 9! 10!\n[/details]\n</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n```\n\nResult:\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td>1</td>\n    <td>2</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>3</td>\n    <td>\n\n[details=\"4\"]\n5! 6! 7! \n8! 9! 10!\n[/details]\n</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n\n### <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2. Paragraph with hidden details (using HTML)</h2>\n\nYou can use a HTML tag to achieve the same result as with the `[details=\"\u2026\"]\u2026[/details]` BBCode tag.\n\nExample:\n\n```xml\n<details>\n    <summary>Summary Text</summary>\n    Hidden Details Text\n</details>\n```\n\nResult:\n\n<details>\n    <summary>Summary Text</summary>\n    Hidden Details Text\n</details>\n\nThis has several advantages over the BBCode version:\n\n* It works in HTML tables without any issues.\n* The summary text can be formatted as well, using additional HTML tags.\n* You can set the initial state so that the details are shown by writing `<details open>\u2026</details>`.\n\n\n### <h2 id=\"heading--3\">3. Inline text with hidden details</h2>\n\nThis uses a HTML link element with a `title` attribute, showing the hidden details when hovering over that link. By convention, we use the `:speech_balloon:` emoji to mark the special role of such a link. The hidden details can only be pure text, but the element can be placed anywhere inside normal text just like a regular hyperlink. Example:\n\n    Example code with <a title=\"More details are here!\">more \n    details :speech_balloon:</a>.\n\n> Example code with <a title=\"More details are here!\">more details :speech_balloon:</a>.\n\n\n### <h2 id=\"heading--4\">4. Hidden editorial comments</h2>\n\nThis method will completely hide text from the reader, but show it in the \"source code\" of the post when opening it for editing. This makes it suitable for editorial remarks, such as markers for to-do items in a text.\n\nThis works by using normal [HTML comments](https://html.com/tags/comment-tag/), such as the following:\n\n    Normal text <!-- TODO: Make the normal text more crazy. --> and \n    more normal text.\n\nLike every HTML comment, text hidden with this method is visible to everyone who can see the topic, by using the browser's Inspector mode (\"right click \u2192 Inspect\"). This means, do _not_ use it to keep information private, only to hide text for cosmetic reasons.\n\nThe above also shows our convention for to-do markers: prefixing the text with `TODO:`.

For the 2/4 deadline we are still working on two SwafS citizens science projects. \nAlberto will participate at Nesta\u2019s event [30 Years of the Web: where do we go next?](https://events.nesta.org.uk/webwheredowegonext?_ga=2.21443832.253215934.1552152151-517868728.1481556637), on Friday at the European Parliament.\n\n- **John** is mainly working on selecting people for the community management positions for NGI Forward \u2013 there are a couple of promising ones, starting Thursday and Friday together with @noemi he will start having conversations with them. \n\n- **Amelia** needs help pushing out [the call for ethnographers](https://edgeryders.eu/t/now-hiring-ethnographers-to-research-the-future-of-the-internet/9620) which is the main goal for the moment \u2013 sharing on social media and reaching out to any academic European networks would be welcome.\nShe is leaving for Krakow for the presentation and training for the POPREBEL crew. She\u2019ll need to give people permission to do coding on platform during the trainings.\n\n- **Matthias** brought up the consent funnel compatibility question. No news yet from the ethical advisors. The decision should be made at least two days prior to the launch of the POPREBEL platform on 31st of March. Alberto will send reminders to them. \n\n- **Nadia** prepared the timeline and activities for outreach. Communication will happen through individual topics with rewards being announced there. The basic content is ready, now it is to check that all links work, that the budget corresponds and send to translation. She found a service that does good machine translation and then community managers can make edits if necessary. \n\n- How to make platform compelling? People will know they will be rewarded for high quality posts and they\u2019ll get the opportunity to build their local events. With NGI, it is also about developing partnerships and proposals for funding. Is it possible to create a smooth interface on the platform which would be helpful with filling-in the forms and building a good application? Matt suggested the topic template which is the closest possible option in the discourse \u2013 possible to find it in category settings. \n\n- We want to encourage people to act as connectors, bring different topics together and give to those who do it a badge for connecting.\nMatt: The easiest is to create a badge which is awarded manually, when the software indicates a person made connections, the community manager can add a badge. \n\n- Badges will be linked to rewards.

Dunbar actually has circles below the 150 number, very close to what you list. \n\nYeah, with regard to the hierarchy stuff - that is a real risk. In my opinion using the \"groups of 5\" to functionally replace a single persons responsibilities you can get a good bit more stuff done. Usually still responsively, reliably and with a better connectedness overall. \nBut I am afraid once you scale into the next layer of 5s you would start getting (increasingly anonymous) hierarchy creeping in again, with all its associated failure modes. \n\nSo the current bottom line effect of my approach is still pretty limited to the smaller end of the scale. BUT when we have a computer (+ human hybrid) start tracking all the relationships, who knows who, who trusts who, etc. and perhaps even can predict the arc of the project / community needs (e.g. varying team skill sets, attrition rates, age compositions, etc.) one could make things work A LOT better. The computer could manage humans very effectively within our baked in hard limitations of the Dunbar circles, making sure that the necessary networks remain continuous and robust at the various required communication and trust levels. And if you know your [percolation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percolation_theory) - that could very well be a game-changer. \n\nBy the way - the military teams of 5 are not an accident either (though I learned that later), again see the linked Dunbar lecture. \nBut I think a perhaps even more interesting analogy are the fingers of the human hand - not least because of the \"opposing\" thumb. It isn't perfect though because I would count the wrist (connection to the rest of the body) as a team member in itself - with the crucial job of connecting the rest of the hand to the wider network (which in reality should be a job done by 2-3 people with a decent amount of turnover). \nBut in that analogy the little pinky is pretty much a dead-weight, which most of the time you keep around because sometimes he's still useful, and cutting it off would just cause a lot of mess and bad blood. Maybe just a little to stigmatizing. ;) So if you have other analogies with good associations, let me hear them.", "created_at": "2019-12-10 23:38:06.764346", "updated_at": "2019-12-10 23:38:06.764346", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 391, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 27.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [67266], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 58471, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 10586, "post_number": 4, "raw": "we're meeting here: https://zoom.us/j/781255424", "created_at": "2019-08-27 14:21:24.162494", "updated_at": "2019-08-27 14:21:24.162494", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 9, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 6.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3630, "user_id": 199, "topic_id": 3597, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<h1>LOTE4: The Stewardship Gathering</h1>\n\nWe found ourselves entwined in conversations during <a href=\"/t/scattered-field-notes-from-london-s-stewardship-meetup/3582\"><span><span>The Case Study Adventures</span></span></a> in August.

I think I will be in Oaxaca Oct 1-5 for a film festival, so I don't know that I will attend, but thought it might be a good place to share information about Edgeryders.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-08-13 17:50:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:07.444090", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 158, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [22835], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 85090, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 14599, "post_number": 1, "raw": "```\n{\n\t\"config\": {\n\t\t\"logos\": [{\n\t\t\t\t\"image\": \"edgeryders\",\n\t\t\t\t\"url\": \"https://resilience.edgeryders.eu\"\n\t\t\t},\n  {\n      \"image\": \"https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/0/0c4021c141fd730eb6452e473eeff3158ecc2848_2_1104x166.png\",\n      \"url\": \"https://edgeryders.eu/c/earthos/sci-fi-economics/284\"\n    }\n\t\t],\n\t\t\"title\": \"What can we learn from the strange economy of the Catalan Integral Collective?\",\n\t\t\"text\": 14594,\n\t\t\"confirmation\": {\n\t\t\t\"title\": \"Thanks for your registration\",\n\t\t\t\"text\": \"Check your inbox to confirm your Edgeryders account, get your tickets and join the discussion on the platform.\"\n\t\t},\n\t\t\"account\": {\n\t\t\t\"title\": \"I'm new\",\n\t\t\t\"login\": \"I already have a username\",\n\t\t\t\"text\": \"Comment bellow to join the forum hosted by Edgeryders and register for the event.

Setting the date: initial plan is sometime mid-April + pre-event a couple of weeks before to present the methodologies. Hackhaton form, two data sets (ours and DeLabs). Alberto taking the lead on this, but we'll need all hands on deck. Especially involved should be @MariaEuler, @amelia, @hugi, @owen, @nadia. Reach out to the University of Bordeaux, Aalborg...possibly link this to Marie Curie grant.     \n- deliverable \"community journalism digest\" is in preparation\n- in POPREBEL: booklets are being produced in different languages to valorize the content produced. \n- TREASURE project: signing the GA soon. Marina will draft the internal budget and this will be discussed beginning of January with the team, to see who will be part of the project and in what way. \n- Hugi advanced on making the Kulturbryggan project happen. It will be interesting and fun looking at different cultural actors in Europe and bringing them on the platform. Might require involvement of around 7-8 persons in the team. Hugi will keep everyone informed. \n- Marina is revising the PMs spent in this year, new contracts will be prepared for beginning of January. \n- Strategy for RezNet: before we proceed with chasing new calls under Horizon Europe, we need to sit down and revise what we offer, agree on what we actually want to do as a team and how. Combining the idea of \"gathering\" with this meeting could be a way to go.

AMA!\n\nIn 2014, the Dutch government introduced a legislation approving the use of a risk scoring algorithm to detect welfare fraud. This system, called System Risk Indication (SyRI), pools together data from various government agencies to calculate the likelihood of committing welfare or tax fraud. The UN Special Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights has described governments' use of similar systems as \"[digital welfare states](https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Poverty/A_74_48037_AdvanceUneditedVersion.docx)\" and condemned them for their lack of transparency and oversight, and discriminatory impacts. In the case of SyRI, we discovered that the system used neighbourhood data to profile against migrant and poor communities.\n\nWith a coalition of privacy organisations, we challenged SyRI on grounds of privacy and equality violations. Earlier this year, the Dutch court found SyRI to be unlawful and ordered its immediate halt. You can read more [here](https://algorithmwatch.org/en/story/syri-netherlands-algorithm/) and [here](https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ECLI:NL:RBDHA:2020:1878). \n\nThis case sets a strong legal precedents for future cases.

I've dreamed of something similar for a while now, so I'm happy to see it actually exists and I can jump in it / join the conversation!\n\nI'm a Creative Technologist, which can more or less mean anything, but in my case refers to:\n- for 5 years I've been working for my company Incidence (www.incidence.io), conceptualizing and building tangible interactive installations for events, both commercial and art related. As such I've been the glue between highly specialised partners and employees (engineers, carpenters, metalworkers, etc) and my clients, and have had the pleasure to jump between prototyping, designing, managing, producing, writing contracts and other fun (??!) practical and legal shenanigans.\n- From September I'm about to start working for a large company as a mix of software engineer and UX designer, analysing their users' needs, coding functional prototypes and shipping finished (code) components to production. \n\nI'm more or less interested in any subject as soon as I start researching into it / discussing it with passionate people, but here are a few of the things I've been putting more focus on as of late:\n\n- Communities and community building (I am currently travelling through Europe visiting some communities and talking with individuals who have built or participated in some), and will start a (mini) experiment in community building by starting an open collective in a shared house in London when I return this Autumn (if I can find the right house to rent - the housing crisis in London doesn't help for these kind of experiments!). \nI'm particularly interested in questions such as how to build communities, how to make them sustainable (not just ecologically), how (and if) they can integrate current capitalistic models to strive, how they can be a model or a drive for change, how they can connect together.\n- Art installations: building on my past experience as an Installation Designer I am starting a new interactive light project. We're at the very beginning now (research and prototyping) but once we've passed this phase I will be looking into funding and exhibition opportunities. This is new to me as I usually rely on commercial funding rather than public art grants, so in the future I'd be interested to connect with people who have some experience around this, if any here. \n- Making tech understandable by everyone. Unless being a techy or someone really passionate about these subjects, most people consider tech as a complex and magical thing that they observe from afar, considering that they do not have the time or capacity to learn about it. I believe this is an extremely big problem because this means that they continue to use services that are detrimental to themselves or society instead of switching or demanding services that truly benefit them on the long term, and leave to tech companies and governments the power to take decisions that will affect them for years to come. \nTherefore I think that we need to create detailed, easy and compelling sources of information for non-techies. We must create mental models of the techs that affect our societies so that people understand them and make informed decisions with regards to those. We must make those in formats that are highly sharable to reach those who are currently less interested in these subjects and thus make discussions about the future of tech more of a public debate. \nOn a personal level I have started to write a series of articles explaining in simple terms which technical features of specific tech tools are required to respect important values such as privacy, freedom of speech and decentralisation. (See first article of the series to come here: https://medium.com/@lauraPoni/stop-leaking-your-private-data-use-signal-not-facebook-messenger-b37eee960aa)\nThese articles should help to clarify complex subjects for non specialised people, however they are not particularly spreadable to a mass public (they still require quite a lot of time to read and therefore some initial interest). But I am thinking of using them as bases for creating other medium that would use some of the information in these articles as a basis. \nAlthough this is currently a personal project, I would be keen to hear from people who might be interested to contribute via feedback, writing other articles, or maybe taking the project further with creating other medium or finding funding for it (or any other thing this might make you think about!)\n- Feminism/gender equality: In the past years I have read and discussed quite a lot around these subjects, and would love to continue this discussion/work on projects around these themes. Especially would like to follow the latest discussions on the subject, as I've been mostly reading about historical feminism (which is still extremely relevant, but would like to start looking at the latest most subtle discussions now)\n\n... sorry for the long intro; would love to hear your thoughts!\n\nAlso please do let me know if I can help with anything :)", "created_at": "2018-08-14 13:55:03.064079", "updated_at": "2018-08-14 13:55:03.064079", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 872, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 198.6, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 4085, 4022, 1935, 4040], "is_private": false}, {"id": 67077, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 11974, "post_number": 38, "raw": "\n\n[quote=\"lylycarrillo, post:36, topic:11974\"]\nWho are these institutions?\n[/quote]\n\nTry the Death Star of Horizon 2020: \n\nhttps://github.com/spaghetti-open-data/ODFest2017-horizon2020-network/wiki/8.-The-Death-Star-of-Horizon-2020\n\nBut NGI has its own high level, that does not necessarily coincide with Horizon 2020 as a whole.", "created_at": "2019-12-06 13:39:25.891556", "updated_at": "2019-12-06 13:39:25.891556", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 53, "wiki": false, "reads": 25, "score": 45.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [67071], "is_reply_to": [67071], "is_liked_by": [8, 5191], "is_private": false}, {"id": 34685, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 6785, "post_number": 1, "raw": "(_This started as an interesting discussion with @hazem and @yosser [over here](/t/id/6774/4). It's early stage, so don't take it seriously until it is :wink: The main implication for the Edgeryders organization would be that we do not aspire to found own, \"The Reef\" branded spaces outside of the Schengen area, but network with those established by locals._)\n\nLet's try to imagine the eventual network of OpenVillage houses \u2013 forming together the worldwide distributed OpenVillage. How could that be organized, and what benefits would each participating communal space get out of it? Here's an opinion.\n\n\n## Content\n \n**[1. Basic vision and organization of the network](#chap-1)**\n**[2. Benefits of joining the network](#chap-2)**\n**[3. Other requirements to join the network](#chap-3)**\n\n\n## 1. Basic vision and organization of the network <a name=\"chap-1\"></a>\n\n**Why this is essential under late-stage \"development\".** It may sound clich\u00e9, but I'm persuaded that the current [urbanization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanization) drive worldwide is both unsustainable and unhealthy, and is unjustified when looking at the potential of already widespread technologies. In low-infrastructure regions (\"developing areas\"), city life is seen as desirable due to a prejudice for being \"developed\" \u2013 until people realize the collective hell they created for each other by coming all to one place. (In my mind there's Kathmandu right now, with all its pollution and noise.) It is much simpler, cheaper and more successful to take the tools of globalization and make small city life and rural life attractive again. (Keywords: Internet connectivity, virtual reality (for fun and to connect spaces over the Net), budget airlines, tourist visa system, international driving licence, remote work over Internet, worldwide product shipment etc.). In the age of Internet, physical concentration of people and resources is grossly overvalued :) What makes a place interesting over the long term is basically _stimulation_ and _opportunities_. Big cities offer lots of that, the countryside does not. However, we can _bring change_ there, for example by having regular international visitors. For them, the new place is a change as well, so a few weeks or months there will be refreshing, not boring. Win-win.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why this option has not yet been realized is, in my view, because it requires collective action. One person alone can't make a small city attractive, but one person alone can go to a big city to see if that is an attractive place. However, a collective, like a worldwide network of communal houses, can make any place attractive.\n\n**A federation, not a franchise.** True to the freedom loving spirit of people attracted to Edgeryders, and because everyone loves to found and have an own project, it seems better to organize the OpenVillage network of houses as a loose federation, not as a franchise with a lot of strict rules. Eac house chooses its own name, and manages its own finances so it can sustain itself. This also relieves the network hub (Edgeryders if you want) of a lot of day-to-day coordination work. If we have one or two spaces to run, it will be enough.\n\n**Local founders and core teams.** A communal space project is necessarily local, so it is much better to let those people start a new OpenVillage house whose commitment to the place can be trusted: locals. It is ok that many in the Edgeryders network are rather nomads, they also have an important role to play (see below).\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to be a kind of world-wide revival of communal living and working projects, so it is a good time to look around for spaces who might want to join the network, esp. early-stage ones. It is definitely _much simpler_ for Edgeryders than to found multiple spaces on our own, including one in the MENA region: if run by local citizen, outsiders do not have any issues with residence permits etc. as they'd stay for visits only. A typical tourist visa is three months, which is fine for a visit. Edgeryders on the other hand can run a 1-3 spaces in the Schengen area, which will be attractive for visitors from MENA region countries and further abroad.\n\n**Self-defined way of funding and running the space.** Each OpenVillage house is independent, so can and should find its own, suitable style of social organization and of financial sustainability. The OpenVillage network may collect and document best practices, but cannot decide anything. Funding may come from sources as diverse as rent from individuals, rent from companies, \"Erasmus for Entrepreneurs\" and \"Erasmus International\" grants, normal crowdinvesting campaigns in exchange for access to the space, a cryptocoin ICO etc..\n\n\n## 2. Benefits of joining the network <a name=\"chap-2\"></a>\n\nBeing part of the OpenVillage network and fulfilling the requirements and obligations that come with that will only work when it has benefits for the space joining. Which makes it important that we _only launch the network once it can offer something_, or it would be rather ridiculous. (An initial offer might be a booking system and documented traveler knowledge that enables visitor flow between spaces.)\n\nA list of benefits of the fully developed OpenVillage network might rather look like this:\n\n* **A common online platform.** Edgeryders would offer to utilize this edgeryders.eu platform as an international online meeting place for all members in the network. It would be used for the exchange of ideas, invitations for online and local events, developing business ideas and giving feedback about them from an international perspective, organizing business partnerships etc.. (So good we have our new, shiny Discourse platform \u2026 I would have been ashamed to offer our old Drupal platform for this purpose :laughing:)\n\n* **Visitor access to all spaces.** Every space must provide at least one guest room (but usually has many more), and it's free to stay there for members of the network. Booking for all spaces has to be possible with a central web-based [booking software](/t/id/6629).\n&nbsp;&nbsp;There could be a rule to allow guest rooms to be rented out for money on AirBnB etc. aside, namely that the guest room has to be booked more than two weeks or less than two days in advance, leaving a window where \"instant booking\" from AirBnB is possible. Software that syncs to and from the AirBnB calendar would be part of the network's infrastructure.\n\n* **Office space for companies from abroad.** A major attraction, also for Edgeryders, of the OpenVillage houses model is that it enables a company to establish a presence abroad with a minimum of resources: just rent a desk in a shared office, and rent it out to temporary users when you do not need it.\n\n* **Project teams coming for a visit.** This will be an attractive option for both sides: project teams can work from a new, inspiring place for some weeks or months; and local members of a space come in touch with \"foreigners\" and their ideas and social networks. Projects can be both cultural, technological (say, open source software / hardware) and entrepreneurial. There would be guidelines making sure that visitors are accessible to locals, so that there will be a good amount of engagement and inspiration as a non-monetary return for the option to visit. There will not even be a need for project teams to come from other spaces in the network if they are really interesting and valuable to have \u2013 actively looking them up and extending an invitation should do the job.\n\n* **Visiting for informal job training.** With the visitor program in place, and co-working spaces with companies in the network, visiting companies in other OpenVillage houses in order to learn there seems a natural opportunity. Basically a self-organized internship program for people who are not eligible for a EU-funded \"Erasmus for Entrepreneurs\" exchange. (And internship would not be the nonsensical \"unpaid employee\" thing it is in Europe, but rather about learning a trade in 3-4 months.)\n\n* **Peer reviews of visitors.** When allowing members of other spaces to book a guest room, of course there has to be a reputation system to manage trust between people who never met. It will feel a bit like a hospitality platform for organizations (\"corporate couchsurfing\"). \n\n* **Peer reviews of spaces.** Instead of a \"code of conduct\", public reviews by visitors from other spaces should be able to make sure that socially abusive behavior in running a space is detected early and can be dealt with. If that does not help, there would be a very-last-resort process of shunning a space (removing its affiliation with the network).\n\n* **Hands-on help with founding a space.** Would include the offer to have ones sustainability plan reviewed by the management teams of an established spaces. And perhaps even that an international team comes together from other spaces to help with renovation and construction \u2013 why not, it's just the first possible visit to a new space!\n\n* **Space management support.** A knowledge base and support forum for how to manage a space and solve typical problems. Including best practices and recipes for interior design, low-cost DIY furniture, recipes for \"creating your own fun\" etc..\n\n* **Tools repository.** A directory with all the [OpenVillage tools](/tags/openvillage-tools), in a well-documented, easily replicable format. Tools would be made specifically for larger houses like co-working / co-living spaces, enabling a low-cost, resource-preserving lifestyle.\n\n* **Traveler knowledge base.** An up-to-date, open content knowledge base to make visitor flow between the spaces effortless. Would contain knowledge about obtaining visas, low-cost travelling between spaces, templates for visa invitation letters.\n\n* **Ride sharing and logistics coordination.** A small but effective system to let members of different spaces coordinate to share car rides between spaces, to arrive with the same airplane for time-saving pickup, and to ship small and large items between spaces by sending them with trustable people who travel between them. This can include whole pallets of products.\n\n* **Doing business \"from space to space\".** Spaces will probably specialize in different segments of the economy, such as biohacking, IT innovation, agriculture etc.. Since spaces will have a frequent exchange online and through visits, an international business network based on personal trust will naturally emerge. For example, one space in Germany may specialize on obtaining used industrial machines (because they are abundant here, and cheap), and then supply them to a business incubator space in Morocco. Or a space specializing in desert agriculture in Morocco can supply nuts and dried fruits to other spaces in Europe through a direct trade scheme, which benefits both sellers and buyers in terms of price compared to buying through the normal multi-tier food market.\n\n* **Moneyless settlement network for doing business.** [PayCoupons](https://pay.coupons/), a tool that I co-developed, could serve as a moneyless payment system for this business network, both for business between companies in the same space, in different spaces, between members and the space, and between the space itself and the network (for fees etc.). The benefit is a boost to this local economy, as one does not have to save up or obtain a load before spending \u2013 in PayCoupons, spending and earning always happens at the same time.\n\n* **Common direct sales marketplace.** Selling in Europe will be attractive to manufacturing companies in spaces in the MENA region, due to the higher sales prices. This only works when doing direct sales, shortcutting the intermediate traders. So the network would want top operate a direct sales online marketplace collaboratively, as this minimizes marketing and branding efforts. (Suitable software is either the one used by \"our\" marketplace [Epelia](https://epelia.com/), or the open source, Ruby based [Fairmondo software](https://github.com/fairmondo/fairmondo)).\n\n* **Combined online marketing efforts.** Direct sales to a high-wage country makes only sense if the marketing is done in the low-wage country as well, or else a lot from the margin has to pay wages for marketers in the high-wage country. Since marketing is about the network's common online marketplace, it is a mutually beneficial activity, much more efficient than if every seller markets only their own products. Marketers can use Google Translate to understand foreign language websites, and online translation services to translate marketing texts into European languages.\n\n* **Shipment centers in each country.** One space per country has to agree to operate a small warehouse for fulfillment logistics. They's receive 30 kg parcels or whole pallets shipped from companies in other co-working spaces abroad, store the content, and ship orders as they come in on the common online marketplace. This allows to provide the cheaper national shipment prices on orders, and allows customers to order from the whole product range produced in the network while paying for shipment only once. (Note: This system of shipment centers was invented for food items on epelia.com. For storable goods, depending on price and amount, it may be more cost efficient to just use Amazon Fulfillment, which is essentially the same service.)\n\n\n## 3. Other requirements to join the network <a name=\"chap-3\"></a>\n\nIn addition to collaboratively providing the benefits listed above, participating spaces would have to fulfill a few requirements regarding transparency and reputation in order to take part:\n\n* **Provide an honest self-description.** This is especially about telling others what organization style, leadership style and lifestyle a space has. For that, the space's profile page would provide around 10 standardized categories to select from, plus details to describe in text form. This information about spaces is currently mostly unavailable, but will allow people to go where they enjoy being, instead of choosing randomly and then making do with the people who are there. It has the added benefit that sociopaths, greedy, angry and otherwise malevolent people can't run a space permanently \u2013 if they do, participants will simply leave and go to better-run places, because leaving and joining is simple enough.\n\n* **Provide a well-defined way of joining and leaving.** Namely, on a space's profile page on the OpenVillage network platform. Ideally, both processes would be web-based and comfortable to do. The OpenVillage network might find or develop a member management software for this, incl. payment management.\n\n* **Contribute to run the network.** Organizing and extending the network is done at-cost: paying wages, but not profits. The membership fee would depend on purchasing power in each country, and in addition it can be paid partially or completely in [PayCoupons](https://pay.coupons/) for those spaces lacking the money. So there is solidarity between spaces.

His competences include \n\n> D\u00e9veloppement Economique \u2013 Emploi - Economie sociale \u2013 Commerce - Revitalisation urbaine (contrat de quartier, CRU, FEDER, politique de la ville) - Planification urbaine (comp\u00e9tence partag\u00e9e)\n\nCharles has a very concrete understanding of \"green building\" (example: people mismanage passively heated buildings, because they do not really understand how to run them), and we were able to connect on the practicalities. Unfortunately, I made a mistake in not presenting the project from zero: from Charles's email, I got the idea that he remembered what we had talked about when he visited us a year ago, which of course was foolish. Here is what we learned:\n\n1. Like elsewhere in Europe, in Belgium it is the municipality (*commune*) who can magick an industrial building into a residential one. Their decision depends on physical characteristics of the building, but also on municipality-wide parameters: as the number of residents increase, *communes* must provide additional parking spots, green areas, places in schools and daycare centers etc. This makes them an essential point of check-in, because a building might be refused conversion into residential if it is in an area that struggles to provide services to existing residents. In general, the main way to conversion is to find a building you like, and then go talk to Charles or his opposite numbers in the other 18 *communes*. They will put you in touch with the owners, and will have an idea of whether the area is eligible for more residents.\n2. An alternative is to respond to public tenders that are already looking for similar stuff. Forest has nothing planned in the immediate future; at the Brussels regional level, the person to talk to is the minister for housing, M.me [Ben Hamou](https://be.brussels/a-propos-de-la-region/le-gouvernement-regional/nawal-ben-hamou). However, I took a closer look at the government, and would argue that our natural ministers are [M. Maron](https://be.brussels/a-propos-de-la-region/le-gouvernement-regional/alain-maron) (*charg\u00e9 de la Transition climatique, de l'Environnement, de l'Energie et de la D\u00e9mocratie participative*), or even [M. Smet](https://be.brussels/a-propos-de-la-region/le-gouvernement-regional/pascal-smet), (*charg\u00e9 de l'Urbanisme et du Patrimoine, des Relations europ\u00e9ennes et internationales*). \n3. His advice is not to go talk to the minister until we are a bit further into execution, with a technical plan and in incorporated organization. We discussed this a bit after the meeting: the need seems to be to \"make it real\" with architect renderings and numbers. We are not ready with that yet, but it seems that it makes sense to invest in both new knowledge (Matt's technical document, my spreadsheets) and communication. We cannot have renderings, but would it make sense to have an artist's impression of life at The Reef? \n4. We should have a clearer story about why Edgeryders is involved in all this. And the story that makes sense is: \"We are a community of people *and one company* involved in a small co-living space. It is working well, and we would like to scale it and open source it\". \n\nWe also learned (but from Chantal) that Brussels Environment has an [exemplary building (*b\u00e2timents \u00e9xemplaires*) unit](https://environnement.brussels/thematiques/batiment-et-energie/bonnes-pratiques-pour-construire-et-renover/sinspirer-des-batiments?view_pro=1).

Or are they influencing policy?\n\n## What next for possible partners\n\nI asked to @chantal_vanoeteren to make appointments with: \n\n1. Whoever is in charge of the exemplary buildings program at Brussels Environment.\n2. The most forward-looking of real estate developer we have identified, ReVive. But: what is their business model?

For School of Apocalypse, the proverbial end of times offers a glimpse into the beginning of a new one.\n\nSchool of Apocalypse (SoA) is a New York City based radical learning community.  They find their inspiration from the emerging feeling so many of us have about fundamental shifts that are occurring in the world.  The idea of the apocalypse is not so much a cataclysmic event, but the sense that the time we are inhabiting is ending and that something new must emerge.  Their goal is to dive into that feeling, unpack its hidden dimensions, and create the cultural language to help us define it. As they describe, \u201cFor us, apocalypse isn't quite a destination but a horizon, an idea that always exists somewhere in the near future, just ahead of us. As we look towards it, it reflects back our fears and desires. Thinking through apocalypse can therefore foreground creativity and survival, and strip away our pretensions to reveal truths about what is essential.\u201d  They have no definition for survival, but rather are interested in the questions that arise from it.  What is essential for us today?  Tomorrow?  Is survival enough? And since death and change are both inevitable, what do we mean when we say survival? \n\nFor them, school is a broadly defined notion that provides a framework for shared knowledge to emerge.  Through pedagogy that is  \u201cplace-based, participatory, experiential, and collaborative,\u201d knowledge is not an accumulated as a set of facts, but is instrumentalized to create new models of thought, behavior, and culture. As they go through this process of \u201cschool,\u201d they investigate what it means to be part of a community of learning.\n\nOne of the ways this school convenes courses is through working groups, which are self-directed autonomous groups that come together around a topic for a 3 month period and share their findings with the rest of the SoA community through a final project (which can take any form).  Some recent working groups include:\n\nChoreographies for Survival: \u201cinvestigates the resilient body and the generative culture space that emerges between bodies that engage in creative acts together.\n\nSurvival Library: \u201caims to consolidate and contribute to an ongoing collection of publications and media works centered around the personal narratives of W/Q/T/POC.\u201d\n\nBodies Intersect Buildings ii: \u201cdevelops a choreography for raising body awareness in space.\u201d\n\nGreenhouses and Bio-art Systems: \u201cexplores the various different aspects of how artistic practice and theory aids in the development of human-centric ecosystems, their biological functionality and the implementation of a living artistic form as a tool for habitat survival and stability.\u201d\n\nSoA brings together artists, thinkers, doers, makers, creatives, among others to think through the chaos of the Apocalypse, hoping that a new cultural imagination is on the other side.  \n\nTo learn more and find out about the next SoA meeting (always free and open to the public), visit them online:  [School of Apocalypse](https://www.schoolofapocalypse.org)\n\nAlso see their proposal for the OpenVillage Festival: [\"Here You Are: How to Experience Your Body in Space\"](https://edgeryders.eu/t/session-proposal-by-school-of-apocalypse-here-you-are-how-to-experience-your-body-in-space/7016)", "created_at": "2017-09-13 22:28:57.832171", "updated_at": "2017-11-13 22:47:26.239813", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 557, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 643.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 53616, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 9826, "post_number": 20, "raw": "how to indicate the newsstories in that spread sheet?", "created_at": "2019-05-17 08:11:43.675820", "updated_at": "2019-05-17 08:11:43.675820", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 9, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 11.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [53428], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 51271, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 9532, "post_number": 2, "raw": "I opened it and am now reading..", "created_at": "2019-03-01 21:36:55.287068", "updated_at": "2019-03-01 21:36:55.287068", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 7, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 12.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 57243, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 10202, "post_number": 8, "raw": "Yes, I hear you, I think you're right. end of August? cc @natalia_skoczylas @nadia", "created_at": "2019-07-29 10:12:38.140497", "updated_at": "2019-07-29 10:12:38.140497", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 15, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [57206], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 67926, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 12262, "post_number": 1, "raw": "*This document summarizes and organizes the practices prevalent in Edgeryders around employing people. They are not being changed, simply made explicit.*\n\n## 1. Background\n\nEdgeryders the company, was founded on top of a pre-existing online community. Since incorporation (in 2013 in the UK, in 2017 in Estonia), the company and the community have continued to exist in symbiosis. The community is highly global, with members all over the world. This was always an important factor of competitiveness for the company, which could claim access to thousands of \"eyes on the street\" in very many places \u2013 a key ingredient of collective intelligence. As a consequence, the company has to date done almost all of its work in a very international milieu, employing people (almost always members of the aforementioned community) in many countries.  Also as a consequence, the work has moved from project to project, and from country (or region) to country. \n\nThis poses the problem of employment. The traditional model of employment does not work well for Edgeryders. Because:\n\n* We prefer to recruit people who are embedded in the societies and specific networks that our projects are about. Ripping them away from, say, Armenia to bring them to Tallinn or Brussels would weaken their local ties. \n* Projects are typically fairly short-lived \u2013 a few months to 2-3 years at most.\n* Traditional employment is not designed for global operations. At any point in time, Edgeryders has on the payroll people from 10 or so countries. With the traditional model (whereby the employer pays social security contributions on behalf of the employee, and transfers her a net salary) we would need to contract payroll companies and accountants in all 10 countries. This would create an unrealistically high overhead. \n\n## 2. Policy\n\nInstead, we follow a policy of putting collaborators on retainer contracts. This means:\n\n* Contracts are tied to specific projects.\n* They specify a set of tasks that the company needs done.\n* They specify the name of someone that the collaborator reports to.\n* Of course, they specify a salary that the company will pay the collaborator. The salary is paid in periodic installments. For short contracts, there may be only one installment. \n* They specify an approximate worktime that the tasks are supposed to require. This means that the company is buying the collaborator's time. Collaborators are normally required to track their worktime, using our online facility (currently at edgeryders.freeagent.com). \n* The intellectual property rights derived from the collaborator's work stays as property of the company. \n* The work needs to be carried out from the company's physical premises (currently we rent office space in Brussels and Stockholm), and/or on its online channels (primarily this platform). The #docs:collaboration category, and especially the [Company Manual](/t/6168), contain detailed descriptions of these channels and how to use them.  \n* The collaborator is paid the entire gross amount, and is expected to pay her own income taxes and social security contributions according to the laws of her country of residence. Most of our collaborators are sole traders, who emit invoices. This is *not* a way to dodge our responsibilities as an employer: we *do* pay social security, even though we leave it to the employee to make the \"last mile\" of the payment in his or her country of residence. This way, the money we spend goes to our employees in the form of salary or social security contributions, rather than to accountants or lawyers. We also try to accommodate mutualistic forms like that of [smart.be](https://smartbe.be). What we would *really* like, however, is a \"European single labor market\", where we pay social security to a low-overhead continent-wide scheme. \n* These costs are classified as `Collaborators` in our accounting system. This is a subcategory of `Costs of labor`, which is itself a subcategory of `Costs of sales`.\n* To reduce our overheads, we prefer to pay retainers quarterly. However, exceptions can be made, for example when employees are financially vulnerable and need quick payments.\n\nIn the language of the [annotated model of grant agreement for European projects](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/grants_manual/amga/h2020-amga_en.pdf), Edgeryders collaborator contracts are equivalent (to employment) appointing acts.", "created_at": "2019-12-24 11:32:34.502283", "updated_at": "2020-01-06 12:01:16.077078", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 701, "wiki": false, "reads": 20, "score": 114.0, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5201, 4096, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22737, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 3388, "post_number": 18, "raw": "<b>Who sets the price?</b>\n\nHi all,\u00a0\n\nSo I notice when services are listed from the Admin - <a href=\"http://www.makerfox.com/market/services?category_id=5946\">example</a>\u00a0- they have no price.\n\nThe when users offer those services they attach the price they are offering it for.\n\nDoes this mean we'll need to instruct users how much they should price the service?

Background](#heading--1)**\n\n**[2. Company organs deliberations](#heading--2)**\n\n**[3. Getting a court decision to validate the GA decision](#heading--3)**\n\n----\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--1\">1. Background</h2>\n\nIn Edgeryders, the management board co-opts new members. Formally, however, the management board is appointed by the General Assembly: a meeting of the company's shareholders. The GA acts as a \"brake of last resort\"; it will appoint anyone the board wants, unless it is someone obviously unfit for the role. This is an extreme case, that signals a conflict between shareholders and board, and it must be resolved before anything else can happen. However, in a normal situation, what happens is:\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2. Company organs deliberations</h2>\n\n1. The board makes a recommendation to the GA to appoint a new director. A good way to do it is through a topic in the #workspaces:directors cat, as in [this example](/t/9316).\n\n2. The GA convenes formally and votes the resolution of appointing the new director. It produces minutes to this extent. The minutes then *must* be translated into Estonian, because they become part of the formal appointment process, and Estonian is the only language in which Estonia's legal system can operate. Example [in English](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YiGa4Al3cTlBPXrzdlfYTiDbCY9kzSWRfXjERgL_6_o/edit), [in Estonian](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KEAnC3-GCT4cYm_BXozrUHNueawWbmo5EPSMxWuPBxw/edit) (requires access to the Director's shared drive).\n\n3. The minutes are signed by shareholders and the new director. We do this through our normal [signing process](/t/6168#heading--4-1). \n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--3\">3. Getting a court decision to validate the GA decision</h2>\n\nThe appointment of a new director must be validated by an Estonian court. Only then will the new appointee acquire legal power of representation. This is done through the company registration portal, and requires that all shareholders and the new director are Estonian e-residents with valid e-ID cards. It happens through a petition submitted to the court via the portal.\n\n1. One of the shareholders logs in to the [company registration portal](https://ettevotjaportaal.rik.ee/) through her or his e-ID card.\n\n2. Navigate to the page with information about Edgeryders, then click on \"Start a petition for an entry regarding alteration\"\n\n    ![image|690x255,90%](upload://gcXVgsdqkeec5wJQQ1MjvI9ip2T.png)\n\n3. Locate the list of management board members, and click on \"alter the persons in the entry\". \n\n    ![image|690x110,90%](upload://vCwHKClIqsPoVPNrBE89yu1zjtB.png) \n\n4. You land on a page with the list of names. Select \"Management board member\" from the drop-down menu below the list, then click on the \"Add\" button next to it.\n\n    ![image|690x262,90%](upload://ksFh5TXLdJ3z2rdjmo1JyslYElx.png) \n\n5. Enter the name and personal ID number of the new director. Leave the optional field \"terms of office\" blank: this means that the appointment does not have an end date. Note: special characters must be entered exactly as in the Estonian version. For example `Asgeirsson` instead of the Icelandic version `\u00c0sgeirsson`. Click \"Add\", then enter the additional data required (residence and email). Click \"Add\" again to return to the previous screen, then on \"Back to entering the details of the application\".\n\n6. Click on \"Add a document\".\n\n    ![image|690x52,90%](upload://mZZmQFZypSM3MwPb0eHEupMObOY.png) \n\n7. Select \"Minutes of the meeting\" from the drop-down menu and select your signed minutes, in the Estonian version, then click on Add a document\".\n\n8. Repeat from 6., but now select the signing log. You end up with:\n\n    ![image|690x76,90%](upload://rHLRwGyP6EjoRaO9ZERpXGRDCEi.png) \n\n9. Now click on \"Check the details of the entry petition\". In the page that appears, check the details, then click on \"confirm the petition\".\n\n10. The petition is now ready. All shareholders and the new director need to sign it through their Estonian e-IDs. To do that, log in to the company registration portal and navigate to the Edgeryders page. Locate the petitions on the opening page. The one created should show up as \"Signing\". Click on \"Edgeryders O\u00dc\" on the same line.\n\n    ![image|690x163,90%](upload://rTyP8leEkU2EbbRtfWxWORdzLu4.png) \n\n11. The page you see reports the list of the signatories. Some might already have signed. Click on the \"Sign\" button and sign with your PIN2. \n\n    ![image|690x164,90%](upload://m5VYklCHDIb9T7xp3WF0xD2NBgv.png) \n\n12.

How we feel emotional impulses may be highly similar and often in large part biologically based (especially more \"creature-like\" emotions emerging from evolutionary response mechanisms) but how we process, interpret, and externalise these emotions (and how we are taught to do so) remains an excellent object of anthropological study.

They're very different, and also depends on the planning of each member of the team, and the extras we have or not. Bit basically, every new comer receives a little cool briefing before anything.\n- how things are done :\nDuring this little brief, we explain when and how things have to be done. We obviously repeat any info if and when needed. Nothing is written, everything is transmitted from one to another. When everybody is on point with the workflow, the completing of the tasks kind of organise itself, led by the main members of the team and followed by the extras. For instance on the mornings I will clean and full my goat cheeses, while my colegue would slice enough Brie for the day. On the evenings when the day is ending, I would clean the dishes while an extra is cleaning the floor, and so on with no roles remaining the day after.\n- the natural rolling rule :\nIf a natural rolling of roles and tasks is working   90% of the time, we all need some adjustments sometimes. Because of the variations in the team composition mainly. It is always a short oral brief reorganizing quickly who do what. Short term adjustments to improve the efficiency of the team at a specific moment, regarding a specific situation.\n- middle and long term adjustments :\nWith the main team changing sometimes, and new people arriving not as extras but as employees, the briefs are deeper for a while, and become more and more discussions about hypothetical  improvements as much as both the new comer and the rest of the team feel comfortable to do so.\n- slow transformations in processes and workflow :\nAt some point, both workflow and processes are changing, with an adaptation to the characters in the team. Everything has to remain productive, but the way we are as individual eventually change from one to another.\n\nSo, as I write this, thinking out loud, I would say that there is no global schema of processes and workflows in a community with tasks. I.think we would fail at trying to map how things and tasks have to be completed.\nIt might be more about a schema of managing people, characters and fits in. And to me, the key is more related to a good inclusion than to anything else.\n\nWould we be able to map what a good inclusion is? Definitively.

I am personally living off-grid and from that experience I can tell that good monitoring of ones energy, water, wastewater, heating and cooling systems is essential for wise resource use and proper functioning.

Network-connected sensors and an evaluation software would combine local consumption data and weather forecasts into behavior recommendations.\u201d\n\n### 3 Call-to-action Status updates: Visual Materials here.\n\n* Call to action + URL #1\n* Call to action + URL #2\n* Call to action + URL #3", "created_at": "2019-11-08 09:38:06.027875", "updated_at": "2019-11-08 09:38:11.693143", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 724, "wiki": true, "reads": 11, "score": 42.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5538], "is_private": false}, {"id": 65437, "user_id": 3703, "topic_id": 11335, "post_number": 8, "raw": "Yes I am in touch with Ahmed :slight_smile:", "created_at": "2019-11-23 15:19:42.906258", "updated_at": "2019-11-23 15:19:42.906258", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 8, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 22.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [65426], "is_liked_by": [5547], "is_private": false}, {"id": 70409, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 12680, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Hello!\n\"I would like to be part of this community.\" - music to our ears!", "created_at": "2020-02-19 06:20:44.549237", "updated_at": "2020-02-19 06:20:44.549237", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 14, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 42.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2330, 6312], "is_private": false}, {"id": 42, "user_id": 4922, "topic_id": 35, "post_number": 1, "raw": "https://vimeo.com/181764358\n\n\n## What makes us a social enterprise (and proud of it)\n\n* **We work for the common good**, and will not accept business if we think that the ultimate effect of what we do is going to be detrimental for society at large.\n\n* **We employ members of our community** \u2013 typically, brilliant misfits whom your average Human Resources department will never ever hire, and who would probably not want to work for you anyway.\n\n* **We share our corporate infrastructure**.

Let us talk about **moderation, mediation, censorship,** and **tone policing**.\n\nThere are probably also other techniques, but for now, talking about these four should suffice. And it is important to talk about them, because all of this is constantly happening online, for various reasons, and sometimes they get mixed, and sometimes one slowly descends into another.\n\nWherever people communicate with each other, they usually set up a few rules and mechanisms to enforce them. Mostly, these rules are a bit vague, ad hoc and have formed over time as social customs emerge. If people violate these customs and unwritten rules, they get some social feedback to correct themselves, or eventually get ostracized from their communities. So if I'm rude to my friends, they eventually stop inviting me for dinner. This is a gradual, informal process, but effective nonetheless. But what I did say keeps being said.\n\nFor a lot of our online communities though, the participants come together from so diverse places and customs that there is a need to formalize things a bit more, and to have designated people in place to enforce these rules. The result is usually a lot less gradual and also more formal and immediate. So instead of being less and less invited to dinners, I suddenly get formally shut out of the community by having my access to the online space revoked. Alternatively, my contributions to the space could get deleted, my voice silenced, even retroactively.\n\nWhen we discuss these rules and their enforcement, we can break them down into four core concepts:\n\n* **Moderation** - here certain topics or media are excluded, with a benign intent. The idea is make a certain online space suitable for a specific audience or topic. An example would be a ban of pornography for a space catering to minors, or the exclusion of car discussions in a forum dedicated to bird watching. \n\n* **Censorship** - moderations evil twin. It basically is the same thing, excluding certain topics from a space, but it implies a sinister motive. A political party forbids the opposition to be heard, a group of people is to be shut out and marginalized. Still, it is important to realise that censorship and moderation are often technically the same beast. The main difference is  that censorship is often also covert and opaque, whereas good moderation is documented and transparent.\n\n* **Mediation** - this includes a vast variety of techniques, but it boils down to the effort of making a friendly and productive communication possible. Mediation doesn't prohibit a topic to be discussed, but tries to prevent an argument to devolve into a shouting match. This can be achieved by translating sentiments or ideas, by encouraging participants to use or avoid specific rhetorics, and so on. As with moderation, mediation has a benign intention, it is a tool to enable communication. It should be transparent insofar as that everyone knows that mediation is happening, and with which intent.\n\n* **Tone policing** is mediation taken too far or being misused. It is especially a thing used by people in power to shut down those who aren't. Valid arguments or complaints get thrown out unless the person making them submits to sometimes arbitrary rules.Mediation and tone policing employ a very similar toolset, but as with moderation and censorship, the malicious or sinister motive is what makes it a bad thing. To be clear: Tone policing is a tool of oppression.\n\nThe problem with both of these two pairings is the huge gray area between them. Just two very simple examples: One can try to gently mediate and end up excluding a group of marginalized people through tone policing.

The clever idea is this: think about a number of  cases (or deaths, which is better because the data are more reliable) no longer grow, as a function of time. Then solve for time, and you get the day when deaths stop. Ok, but how do you know how many deaths are \"needed\" for this to happen?\n\nThe approximation seems to be the following: at some point the growth rate of deaths (as a function of the number of deaths) follows a downward linear trend. If you can estimate the trend (including constant term), then you can look at where it hits the X axis. That is the total number of deaths that will occur. The problem with this is that the growth rate of a logistic does not follow a linear trend, *exactly*. You can employ statistical approximations, of course, and in the paper you see that the one the author employs fits the data well, but I am not sure what the underlying mathematical reasoning is \u2013 my calculus is rusty enough that it would take me too long to derive and analyze a formal expression for the average  daily rate of growth of deaths over the last two days, as a function of the cumulative number of deaths (which is what the author estimates).

How it became important in the buddhist culture to wash the bodies of the deceased to wash their bodies in the water and then release them, then water became very polluted, and this stopped, but this was really important for the culture. \n\nOn development of Kathmandu and how it grew from the the 60s till now, there is not enough sewage control, so every stream that feeds in the river is polluted, by the time it leaves the valley the water is black from sewage and industrial waste,\nNow they have gotten grants to build water treatment units, some were build some were not due to corruption. \nThe hope at this point to clean the water but diluting the water till they get enough water treatment plants.\n\nThis was the art side, now the community side.\nThe fly fishing program We meet every week and reflect on how many insects that live in the stream. \nBesides fly fishing we talk about the value of water how to evaluate how clean the water is, and we up the stream collect the bugs, and the no of bugs tells us how clean is the water.\n\nProgram started 18 years ago. Lots of underprivileged people ?in the inner city \nA lot of students went to environmental sciences, these individuals to become stewards of the environment. \nWe provide mentors for the kids and provide a positive role model, that we found that to be very important in these communities \n\nWe realized that there are needs in other communities, it was clear we couldn't go for all these communities to do the same, then we started to work with adults, community leaders, teachers, etc so we started a conference and we provide all the equipment and the materials with 50 % discount from the industry for them to start their own program.\nWe host also a steam cleaner, not only clean but plant trees they allows more bugs to survive. \nWe have done 5 conferences already , in the mornings in the classroom and in the afternoon we go to fly fish, and see it as an activity to bring students outside. \n\nAfter this we are going to work with communities in new mexico. \n\nNow working on extinct birds art work collection. As we are facing mass extinction nowadays. \n\n\nLast thing that flyfishing does,\nWe started to re introduce this fish species, they are very sensitive to water quality, we fundraised and worked with the youth and adults and we are now fro 7?\nYears introducing this bruter?\nFish to local waters.\n\nThe fish started to migrate to other streams as well. This was very successful and we are continuing with the program and trying to expand it. \n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=winnie]\n_**How you approach the same thing in Nepal?**_\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=Alberto Ray]\nWhen we started the program, was very small, had 4 students took years and sometimes we couldn\u2019t find a place to have it, this made us seem unpro, then we found a place that can host us every week, then it started, this consistency is important. \nWe used not to make in the summer, then now we do it all year round.\nWe have kids that r 10 years old and mentors that are 80 years old \n\nIn Nepal , we spend a lot of time to work with water experts and find info that are not mentioned in the documents, the main issue with kathmandu is for the generation , the youngest generation has no memory of the river being clean, they have the idea of it is always dirty and will always be this way. And if the old generation didn\u2019t work on reclaiming their old vision there is a sense of hopelessness as the young was accepting the situation. \n\nWe were there to make a difference, and participation level was different, there are a lot of things that are needed to be done. It could happen. \n\nOften it takes one person to market that difference, you can start and ask for the assistance, but you need somebody to organize and help and raise the funds, and you will find a lot of interested people who don\u2019t want to be leading but they want to be there and help with what they can,\n\nThen you gotta have fun doing it. As most of this is volunteering.\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=Islam]\nFor kathmandu what are the steps need to recover it if you will stay for longer?\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=Alberto Ray]\n\nThere has to be political incentive to do it, there are a lot of non govt. organization who do what they can, but when the money goes to the government, it stops there, so if anyone wants things to be done they give money to these ngos. \nThere were a group of women who were collecting water and got introduced to clean the water using ceramic filters and others techniques these was done by these NGOS.\n\nA lot of other problem with the groundwater, so there is also lack of water, \n\nIts  a problem that is there for a long time, now there is a pressure to do something as even some people can have their political positions in stack.\n\nAcoli alone is not harmful but the mix and other wastes together ( note form the biologist from the audience )\n[/quote]\n\n\n[quote=Alberto Ray]\nFunding for the flyfishing\nIt is kinda a long story I was going in a flight sat next to a guy we got to talk, and then by the end so what do u do, I work in an organization that gives funding for groups who work with kids,.... Not too much, but enough to do stream cleanups, and make some sponsors for the cleanups and what's left we put in the flyfishing and get donations and equipments for free. After having a consistency it's easy to get free equipments , even more than what we need, we even give them to other groups\n[/quote]\n\n\n[quote=Sohyeb] \n_(The most exciting discovery)_\nIt was probably couple month ago when we found out that there are bructa (the fish species ) down other streams, which was not expected to survive. The idea of this and the kids to realize this they handle life fish to put in water.\n\n_(Saddest discovery)_\nThe bagmati (Kathmandu river) we try to do what we can , but just seeing the level of corruption and you like to be hopeful but you don\u2019t know. There is hope they make every saturday they have clean ups this never stops even after the earthquake, \nThe water is still toxic but when they finish, you can\u2019t find a piece of paper by the banks.\n[/quote]\n\n\n_**Was working with fishermen, and they want clean water but they do affect the water?**_\n\n\nJust a comment as the people don\u2019t know how was the river being clean, we are also for example don\u2019t know how was it before money .\n\n[quote=noemi]\nWhat's your expectations from this place, the people here, the festival?\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=Alberto Ray]\nMy program started from a discussion for 2 hours with another person , I wanted to do something for the kids in my community. \nTo figure out the nuts and bolts, then you have a community of helpers and get started.\n\nWhat is the cultural significance of bodies of water?
