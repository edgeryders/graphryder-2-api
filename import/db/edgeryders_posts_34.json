You could even combine basic information: put in the same graph the rising number of diabetics D, the rising price of insulin P, and the total cost of providing insulin D x B x Q, where Q (constant ) is the number of insulin doses a patient consumes in a year.

Me, I am still stuck in <em>The Virtual Community</em> by <a href=\"/u/howard_rheingold\">@Howard_Rheingold</a>, with a hint of 6th century Western monasticism: I do what I do to contribute building a space where people can live, work and learn together, on the basis of a more-or-less aligned understanding of what should and can be done. This turns out to be really difficult, because even low-overhead, efficient endeavours like Edgeryders have coordination costs, and someone has to saddle them, or the shared space will break down. The idea of building a social enterprise on top of the community is a way to address this issue. But social enterprises, too, are subject to mission drift, and the risk of refocusing on supporting the structure rather than pursuing the ultimate goals is high. For this reason, we also try to build a shared recognition that people in Edgeryders are broadly aligned, and it makes sense even at the individual level to carry\u00a0<em>some</em>\u00a0small coordination cost. This involves trying to endow Edgeryders with a sense of place; an idea that people who roam these (mostly virtual, as Howard would say) rooms are probably people you could only not get along with, but work with to stay afloat as humans in a turbulent world.

This is a fundamental issue.\t\nAs Millie Begovic, Shelley Inglis and Indy Johar say in their [post](https://medium.com/@UNDPEurasia/nextgengov-the-big-boring-bureaucratic-revolution-d5dc78e53b1c) launching the UNDP IID2018 programme: \n> \u201cwe hypothesise our Governance models are broken. We are holding on to 19th century models that deny the complexity of the \u2018systemocracy\u2019 we live in \u2014 a world of massive interdependencies.\u201d\n\nSo what do we do? Well to start with we look around at what we have available to us. Seeing a world of struggling complexity and complicated solutions, like our ancestors before us, we turn to our soothsayers. \nIn order to break our gridlock of complex interdependence, in order to free ourselves from the shackles of what we cannot achieve, we have to delink ourselves from the reality, we have to become unconstrained in our thinking - we need to **dream** new systems. \n\nSo we look to those who are already in the dreamspace; we find those people who are engaged on a daily basis with the creative activity of dreaming up the future, and we read what they write, and we ask them: what other options are there for us?\n\n## Science Fiction? Really?\n\nI believe that all fiction is a crucible for the neuroses of each generation, and since its inception as a genre, Science Fiction doubly so. As I talk about in [this post](https://edgeryders.eu/t/a-preliminary-synthesis-of-econscifi-activities-so-far/9099) on the Edgeryders site, \n\u201cWe seek to understand our current world by imagining new versions of it, speculating challenges and opportunities that allow us to better understand what we are facing today and prepare for tomorrow.\u201d\n\nYou only need to look at the current fascinations of media created for mass consumption (Hollywood, Teen fiction, Television Box Set Drama) to see the anxieties that we all face mirrored back at us. But why are we stuck in a circus of post-apocalyptic hero narratives? The superpowered hero; the sole saviour; the wasteland where only the young can change the future. All idealised narratives that say \u201cdon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s someone else\u2019s job to fix that.\u201d\n\nIf younger generations must wrestle with the real world complexities for a stable and prosperous future, then where are the mediums that delve into creating those futures? That sees the danger and damage and looks beyond it, assuming that we will go on together? That sees that the ways forward require collaboration, imagination, cooperation and group action? That starts to imagine a new future with alternative economic systems that are better adapted to dynamics of 21st Century challenges?\n\nThe answer is that these stories **are out there**, and they are being thought about in so many different ways and places: like in theatre companies doing radical speculative work with trans youth; or in the manifestos of citizen-led movements bringing refugees and locals together for dinner and increasingly between the pages of a number of Science Fiction writers who are dealing with versions of this possible future. \nWithin the Edgeryders community we\u2019ve begun exploring a particular niche of these works of \u2018**EconSciFi**\u2019, and alongside our other research initiatives we\u2019ve started our own internal topic to look into this area of speculative fiction directly. We wanted to find out more about the people who dream it, what they\u2019ve been saying, and, perhaps most importantly, are they on to something?\n\nWith this new topic of EconSciFi in mind, and a handful of examples each, we set out to find more representations of it. We threw the conversation open to our community and to the wider internet and encouraged people to reflect with us on this wild topic, and make suggestions for work we should be considering. We wanted stories that in some way gave us a representation of a better future, outside the limiting constraints of our \u2018real world\u2019 economic system. We ended up with a huge https://edgeryders.eu/t/econ-sf-a-selection-of-works-and-authors/8582, containing suggestions from dozens of community members. We asked the collective brain and they replied.\n\nAlberto Cottica summed it up perfectly in his initial [post](https://edgeryders.eu/t/econ-scifi-can-we-imagine-a-completely-different-economic-system/8534/70) on the topic:\n\n> \u201cThere is an important idea that is not receiving enough attention: the economic foundations of a modern society (let's say late 21st century). All I am seeing being discussed is minor tweaks on capitalism-with-state-corrections. This was not always the case: in the 19th century we had attempts at sweeping paradigm design (Marx, Proudhon, anarchic collectivism and mutualism), as well as prototypes (Fourier's Phalanst\u00e8res, Owen's New Lanark, and, later, Adriano Olivetti's Ivrea factory as the economic engine of the Community Movement).\u201d\n\nI have always believed that fiction inspires theory; and theory inspires practice. But when we scan the edges of our societies, we see a lot of the speculative practice already happening, so where is the theory and fiction? Perhaps what we are seeing now is an inversion of the idea, and part of what research into this topic can give us is the tools to open these lived practices up to the spheres of theory and fiction, making them available and understandable to more people, and pushing these new methods of living and prospering back towards the centre? Importantly, Edgeryders is not an institution, a lot of us aren\u2019t even academics, we\u2019re interested individuals from a variety of backgrounds working together and using collective intelligence to bring people together and help build the world we want to live in. Our \u2018research\u2019 is public and our discoveries are shared.\n\n## What do I hope EconSciFi can do to move things forward?\n\nIt can provide an open platform and fertile environment for the discussion of the economic ideas in science fiction books between published writers of both, and that we lead from that discussion into further opportunities for deeper learning and research into these areas.\nIt can act as a bridge between the world of economics and mainstream speculative fiction, as well as a provocation to both sides to be more permeable with each other.\nIt can create the environment for a call to arms for economic writers and academics to try harder. As Alberto says above, where is the \u201csweeping paradigm design\u201d? Where are the radical economics thinkers? Who is looking into the data generated in radical economic systems? There must be people out there doing this work, and perhaps EconSciFi can be a rallying point around which they can meet?\nSimilarly, EconSciFi can be a call to arms for Science Fiction writers to imagining better futures that operate outside the structures of market capitalism that dominate most 20th & 21st Century SciFi. By drawing attention to the work of those writers who are doing this \u2018heavy lifting\u2019 already we hope to encourage and inspire more writers to take up the mantle.\nFinally, and I hope most importantly it can help explain innovative or nascent economic ideas to a wider audience through live events and clear communication. We also ask ourselves, what place does collective intelligence have in achieving this?\n\nPerhaps alongside the work Edgeryders have done in the past to find \u2018[FutureMakers](https://edgeryders.eu/t/we-have-a-name-futuremakers/4415)\u2019 EconSciFi offers us a platform and a mechanism to find the \u2018FutureMakers of Economics\u2019?\n\n## But I\u2019m not an economist or a writer, why should i engage with these ideas?\n\nTo my mind EconSciFi gives us a handful of useful tools; the most useful of which is that it breaks down our cognitive biases and actively encourages us to utilise the parts of our brain that ask \u201cwhat if?\u201d. To some extent all fiction does this, but because of the richness of the established tropes of Science Fiction we allow ourselves to fully step out of the quotidian experience of human global existence as we know it now.\n\nIt gives us a space to explore methods, ideas, solutions and compromises that challenge everything that we know about the world we live in. It doesn\u2019t concern itself with establishing a complete, complex interdependent system of realities, but instead it often focuses on one germ of an idea, and then runs with it. \n\nIf you speculate \u2018What if the one thing that was required to successfully pilot intergalactic spaceships, and therefore oversee an Universal Empire, was only available on one, tiny, deadly planet?\u2019 Then you get Frank Herbert\u2019s **Dune** and the complete (and still ongoing) saga of stories that lead from that creation.\nSimilarly, if you ask \u2018What if instead of remaining on Earth within Nation States, the massed followers of Marxist socialism have moved to The Moon?\u2019 you would get Ursula K. LeGuin\u2019s masterpiece novella **The Dispossessed.** \n\nBoth of these examples deal with the tropes of SciFi at their farthest limits (yet always with parallels closer to home) but the genre is a broad church and it doesn\u2019t have to be in the depths of space to classify as SciFi.\nFor example, imagine an Earth where we had reached a tipping point: the intersection of climate change threat; regressive national policies; divisive rhetoric; increased polarisation; income inequality; massed power and economic resource in an ever diminishing number of hands; wholesale dislocation and disengagement with political and economic structures; a growth of stateless peoples\u2026 How prescient does Cory Doctorow\u2019s **Walkaway** seem? \n\nWe\u2019ll explore more of the ideas that come out of that book within the EconSciFi Zone of Experimentation? at the UNDP IIDs, or you can dive into our discussions around the economic arguments here.\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/3b040e235763b51c0dcd796be192e65e1ce6d97f.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"429\">\n## What will we be doing for UNDP IID2018?\n@anique.yael  will be publishing a blog post very shortly that details the ideas and work we have done around making our Zone of Experiment as a place for independent growth and understanding. So i\u2019ll let her explain that in more detail.\nAt the centre of the Zone however is an open discussion and Q&A between Alberto Cottica, Edgeryders Co-Founder and Research Director (@alberto) , Malka Older, Author of [The Centennial Cycle](https://medium.com/join-scout/what-does-the-future-of-democracy-look-like-208108b14ee2) (@Malka) , and Raffaele Miniaci, Professor of Economics, University of Brescia (@Raffaele) .\n\nWe expect that through bringing these people together we can create a dynamic of tension and speculation between the spheres of understanding in a room: The challenge of the pure science, the mathematics, the measurable and measured; The understanding that underpins the systems of our current civic and social interaction; Demonstrable; Alignment; Stable. (Perhaps we should call it the \u2018Field of Economics\u2019).\nBrought together with the freedom to innovate within a creative space; The ghost of the idea, and speculation that sees something outside of a measurable system and explores that centrally through imagination, freed from analysis of the world as it is and towards creating a world where it can be. The tenet. The inciting concept.\n(Perhaps the \u2018Field of Speculation\u2019.)\nIn and around that interplay we are mediated and provoked by researchers and creators who ask the central questions of both sides: how does that look in our world? Can you point to examples of where this \u2018fictional\u2019 idea exists in our world now? How can this idea be communicated so that it is understandable? What elements of these ideas are we already living/exploring/understanding?\n\nFor me this zone of experiment acts as a way to open ourselves up, and through research, understanding and collaborative practices work to build better systems and futures. It tells us its okay to look elsewhere for answers to the problems we face. I hope that it can point to new pathways for governance to [\u201cprovide a framework for the creation of public value and preservation of the public good\u201d](https://medium.com/@UNDPEurasia/nextgengov-the-big-boring-bureaucratic-revolution-d5dc78e53b1c) Preferably through the most surprising and imaginative ways possible.\n\n> \u201cthe end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time.\u201d TS Eliot", "created_at": "2018-11-16 13:09:21.362157", "updated_at": "2018-11-25 19:17:36.304603", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2196, "wiki": false, "reads": 25, "score": 450.0, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 4739, 3904, 3310, 4735], "is_private": false}, {"id": 48667, "user_id": 4718, "topic_id": 9192, "post_number": 4, "raw": "While I think we're circling in on a core group of novels, I'd like to put a question out to twitter about short stories that might be relevant.

Like you said, currently, these platforms are indispensable.

I.e. I can't order a ride when there is no driver available.\u00a0\n\nI was wondering if some of the money that doesn't go to overhead would result in slightly larger pay for the service providers?

The latter case can usually be presented more convincingly and thus efforts for the former generally give way/have to be adjusted the business case. Usually the respective approaches use different models of society, and means to work towards their end. <em>If </em>that dynamic is part of what is going on I would like to see the it elaborated a little more in the reflection part.\n\nI also found it interesting that the methods of organizing (the Dr.'s visiting time, the student &amp; carpenter workshops) are so different that some of the initiatives seem to fail on that basis alone. If I had to venture a guess - the people were previously not aware that might be a problem (or something to discuss in the first place), and when they realized they'd have to organize differently it was already too late.\n\nHave a look at this way of digging deeper into heritage, and presenting it to a wider audience (perhaps with the OSM people?):\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/aGlRyMITXMc\n\n", "created_at": "2017-08-02 01:43:42", "updated_at": "2017-08-02 01:43:42", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 326, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 7.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27478, "user_id": 217, "topic_id": 4433, "post_number": 11, "raw": "<b>this isn't helping.</b>\n\n\"This thread derailed quite badly as soon as Arthur started levying accusations of fraud and incompetence\" is a long-winded way of saying 'he started it!'.\n\n\"Sam, would you not agree a person facing such an allegation has the right, the duty indeed, to defend herself and her honor?\"\n\nSure, why not.

GraphRyder is not a finished product: it is a tool for analysis. Once researchers have interpreted the data, with the help of a lot fiddling with it, they are ready for returning the results of the whole exercise.\u00a0\u00a0The non-expert-ready form of approaching the data is generally post-analysis: a report, an executive summary, an infographics, depends how much\u00a0you want to editorialise it.\n\nThat said, you make a good point. When we were writing <a href=\"https://github.com/opencarecc/scaling-digital-ethnography/blob/master/INSCI%202017%20submission/insci-2017-opencare.pdf\">the methodological paper</a>, I realised there are\u00a0<em>no</em>\u00a0experts on this stuff. Some people understand ethnography. Other understand networks. Almost no one understands both. Even in the research group we tend to be either-or, with maybe a vague idea of what the other camp is all about (and the vast majority of humanity, of course, understands neither, nor does it care). That leaves us with two strategies: either we write in a heavily context-dependent way (explain ethnography when submitting to netsci journals, explain graphs when submitting to anthro journals); or we assume that no one knows anything at all. In the case in point, we were submitting to something called the Internet Science\u00a0Conference. Whatever the hell Internet Science is, it is unwise to assume an audience that understands networks like @melancon , or ethno like @Amelia . So, we actually introduce all concepts (not bad for a 7 pages paper!):\n\n<em>Ethnography is a qualitative research technique aimed at discovering how a certain group of humans perceives a set of issues [...]</em>\n\nSo: what you propose is relatively simple to implement, though we would definitely have different pages for the background information. Actually, I already added <a href=\"https://github.com/opencarecc/graph-ryder-dashboard/wiki/SSNA-Key-concepts\">a page</a> on key concepts. Why, the wiki is three hours old! But my question to you (and all) is:\n\n<strong>Is this interesting for people who are not involved with ethno/anthro/qualitative research?\u00a0</strong>Should we even make the effort to talk to them?\u00a0\n\nFinal remark for @WinniePoncelet and the \"science communication\" crowd in Reagent and elsewhere. I am def no expert, but I find that you cannot dumb down the \"how did you get this result\" question more than so much. For example, a much simpler work like my own network analys of Horizon 2020 consortia looks like <a href=\"https://github.com/spaghetti-open-data/ODFest2017-horizon2020-network/wiki\">this</a>.

The lack of acceptance of these currency on the global financial markets seems to be a requirement for them to serve their purpose, and to add resilience to the financial system.\n\nNow, locality does not need to be geographical in a networked world: it can be social.

I'm a science fiction author and a big data researcher from Sri Lanka. I used to be a journalist. I now work at a nonprofit called LIRNEasia, which has research ops across Asia, Lat-Am and Africa (if you need representative demand-side data on aspects of tech access, for example, give me a shout). We're a policy outfit - research, then policy suggestions, which we then try place in the right hands. \n\nMy specialty is mostly networks - communities derived from social media data and call detail records. I've been working this year with pseudoanonymized call data for ~10 mill people and with snapshots of the Facebook universe of friend links, analyzing how nations cluster together and then figuring out what this data can tell us about political blocs that we're interested in. I've shown that these connections have high correlations to bilateral trade and migration - more research ongoing.\n\nMy writing: I would say I lean very strongly toward the cyberpunk - because the whole dynamic of the future being already here, but unevenly distributed is something I see daily in Asia. \n\nSome time ago I did a very crude data scrape off twitter - about 75k tweets, reduced to 15k cleaned - looking for what people meant when they said \"utopia\". My understanding is that there is not one, but several utopias - many fundamentally incompatible with one another; and our society is the tangent produced by agents constantly acting and interacting with these utopias in mind. I try to explore this thought with stories around different utopia. Operative word: try.\n\nMy most successful book has been Numbercaste, where I swapped out credit rating with social influence metrics (fairly easy if you assume a 2030s where everyone's on social media, and those not face economic persecution). Pagerank for people, if you will. I wrote it from the perspective of a Silicon Valley corp pushing their utopia where the artist can be as important as the billionaire. Of course, every utopia is someone else's dystopia, and because children inherit the social networks of their parents, what the world ends up with is an algorithmically enforced caste system of sorts. \n\nNot a wholly original concept, but it turns out people like it. So I'm currently working on a trilogy for HarperCollins about a cyberpunk world loosely built off a history where Archduke Ferdinand never got shot. It's mostly about a machine uprising on colonial Ceylon, so mostly John Searle / Peter Watts turf. \n\nAnd I've run out of things to toot my own horn with.

I trained with the 'Eastern' futures tradition - Inayatullah, Bussey, Ramos etc - and our endeavour was always to deepen our understanding of the future through comprehension of the present. Our role, as it was once said, is as \"ancestors of the future.\" Prediction and the mechanical approach to crafting a particular future and devising its strategy - much like the US military futures approach - was something we grew to loathe because it didn't create enough appreciation for the multiple factors acting upon the creation of the future as we speak. I appreciated the critical futures approach and though I may diverge from it at points I think it offers a solid base upon which to base futures praxis. This is the line of thinking I employ in my own work and being in a region which offers a unique environment to test the resilience of futures approaches and tools I'm finding it very effective.\n\nBest,\n\nAbaas\n\n", "created_at": "2014-09-29 07:09:01", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:45.092387", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 187, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 49206, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 9229, "post_number": 16, "raw": "I agree, the more it is a collaborative work the better, and also it's good for me to start working on this project officially in January and less before, unless it's absolutely necessary.\n\nThat also leaves us with some time to think about how to approach it, familiarize ourselves with the forum, and become super admins :-)", "created_at": "2018-12-05 12:17:21.117413", "updated_at": "2018-12-05 12:17:21.117413", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 58, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 7.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [49163], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23813, "user_id": 43, "topic_id": 1745, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Changed title of my post</b>\n\nI changed the title and content of my post about the Commons, because it was out of date.

The UN is looking at three different models for coordination among stakeholders:\n\n1. Internet Governance Forum+ (IGF+): this model reflects the current structure of internet governance and the United Nations, with some enhancements.\n2. Digital Commons Architecture (DCA): a simplified structure of three bodies, a *tech panel*, a *digital commons platform*, and an *architecture secretariat*, that coordinate through the existing infrastructure at the United Nations.\n3. Distributed Co-Governance (CoGov): two bodies, *network support platforms* and *digital cooperation networks* , that coordinate through a network of networks.\n\nI found the DCA a compelling, internet-native model that sacrifices some of the speed of more centralized UN control. I somewhat doubt they will implement the model, but it is one I lobbied for:\n\n![image|514x433](upload://cz8lyTaJg6dqDJ7sjSqWNVVKcjc.png) \n\nFull details on all the rest in the  [**The Future of Internet Governance**\n](https://schmud.de/posts/2020-06-06-internet-governance.html) blog post, with pretty graphs.", "created_at": "2020-06-08 09:50:40.411975", "updated_at": "2020-12-14 18:09:47.758708", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 238, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 243.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 85082, "user_id": 4861, "topic_id": 14570, "post_number": 13, "raw": "[quote=\"hugi, post:1, topic:14570\"]\nWe should look into this, and if not we should try to figure out what a replacement library could be. @melancon, @jason_vallet - are you aware of any new state-of-the-art libraries for in-browser graph viz?

Last time I checked, it stood at 3,082 contributions, authored by 282 different contributors. It contains 615,000 words, quite a bit more than Tolstoy's War and Peace, with its 587,000. The flow of experiences and creativity has been, and still is, incredible. As all this content poured in, the heroic @Amelia kept annotating with ethnographic codes. As I write this, the OpenCare corpus has been enriched with 6,221 annotations, with 1,362 codes.\n\nAbout six months ago, we realised something wonderful was happening. Despite the sheer size of the corpus, we could still make sense of its globality. Using Open Ethnographer and <a href=\"http://graphryder.opencare.cc/\">GraphRyder</a>, we have been encoding the conversation as a network of people, their contributions, and the ethnographic codes associated to the latter. We can then use this network to produce various representation of the conversation. My favourite one is the code co-occurrence network. In it, when ethnographic codes appear together in the same contribution, they are connected by an edge. When we look at it, we are looking at a sort of map of the whole conversation: 600,000 words boil down to one single image. Like every map, the co-occurrence network discards a lot of detail: but that's a feature, not a bug. What remains captures something important about the architecture of collective intelligence in OpenCare.\n\nThis method turns out to be scalable. Today's network is just as comprehensible as those we made nine months ago. Yet, they encode twice the content as those older versions. Our hunch is turning out to be right.\n\nTo me, this is beautiful. I watch these networks come together, and I look at them, and I see new patterns about OpenCare. They are undiscoverable otherwise \u2013 I spend a lot of time reading and participating, yet I did not see some of them. And they are verifiable: when you go look at the actual content generating the patterns, you see they are solid.\n\nA scalable method for ethnography! Think about the implications. You could have a new instrument for qualitative research, that can complement surveys at scale. Call it Massive Open Online Ethnography. Surveys scale very well, but are not very sophisticated methods otherwise. They suffer from serious issues. Electoral polls, for example, are surveys; and they are flimsy at best. Ethnography does not have those issues: by not asking direct questions, it does not bias informants. By working with open questions, it can capture novely and weak signals. By letting people interact, it enables them to use collective intelligence, not just add up individual opinions. But ethnography scales very poorly. Or rather it did, until now.\n\nWhat if we could learn about how citizens are thinking about the state of their country analysing an open conversation online, rather than through a closed questionnaire? What if we could have a conversation-based version of Eurobarometer?\n\nSo, together with Amelia, @Jason_Vallet and @melancon we wrote a short paper explaining our method. Here it is (<a href=\"https://zenodo.org/record/1059029#.WhFiTLQ-cWo\">zenodo.org</a>, <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/33962048/Semantic_social_networks_a_new_approach_to_scaling_digital_ethnography\">academia.edu</a>). We will be presenting it at the <a href=\"http://www.internetscienceconference.eu/\">Internet Science Conference 2017</a> and at our own OpenVillage Festival.\n\nYou too can explore the network: GraphRyder is <a href=\"http://graphryder.edgeryders.eu/\">open to all</a> (no login needed).

Realise you\u2019ve been talking about this for months &amp; I don\u2019t know the web that\u2019s been weaving all this time between you all but my reflections:\n\nYour focus on learning about how to do autonomous healthy caring community through a bold, experiential meeting of people is bang on. Focusing productive engagement at a mobile health village on care, resilience, fitness, mental health, spirituality, communal living\u00a0+ space + wild imagination &amp; hacking + radical economics all sounded needed by the many different community ventures and community interventions\u00a0that are rising in 2017.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIt already sounds like a bold invitation to people to join, collaborate and go for it but the questions about the\u00a0the precision of the invitation &amp; the precision of the activity feels important. Brought to mind the many excellent social initiatives that fo.am has spawned over the years <a href=\"https://fo.am/activities/\">https://fo.am/activities/</a>\u00a0and\u00a0communicated so clearly.\n\nYou asked me about events that I had experience of &amp; I\u2019m not sure I answered that well. But events that combine focused invitation with a mix of supportive structure &amp; improvisation so that people can creatively participate with\u00a0purpose work for me.\u00a0 Even better events that through the meeting itself prototype &amp; meet a specific question of care: this shifts depending\u00a0on the context and where the meeting is.\u00a0 If you pivot the whole thing to Morocco - then there\u2019s a different care need\u2026 \u00a0\n\nOn a Games tip, it made me think of the Brighton Cascade project I set up with Felix <a href=\"http://cascade.network/\">http://cascade.network/</a> &amp; the unfulfilled plan we never found funding for which was first on our list for what we wanted to do after the COP21 had settled\u00a0 which was \u201cCity Game &amp; Action Residency\u201d <a href=\"http://cascade.network/five/\">http://cascade.network/five/</a>. The aim was an action residency &amp; living differently with each other across a number of days on a different economic exchange whist tying it in with a food lab, sleep lab, creative lab open to the public and sharing tools/ knowledge and supported in the spirit of play by a city wide game inviting people into living differently. But you know what it needed to really make it work was one\u00a0clearly understood focus.\n\nThe reason the cascade.network went dormant is 1. people had jobs &amp; the workshop aims were easier to achieve 2. people wanted leadership &amp; focus to create in reaction too and give it shape - I didn\u2019t recognise that and kept on seeking to accomodate everyone's interests &amp; waiting for a consensus which never came 3. (and this is the big one!) it was not clear how, apart from being fun and creative, this would actually actively help the climate situation.\u00a0\n\nReflecting on this today I agree with what Nadia said on the call - that a certain state of trust is necessary. To be bold and make the experiment with a leap of faith and make sure to learn from it in an organised way. We never know\u00a0where any creative act leads. In a very basic way setting up creative healthy spaces that are emboldening, empowering and give people great information, new ideas and a lived sense of new potentials has an effect that is meaningful, rich, valuable.\u00a0\n\nHowever what I like about Edgeryders is your pragmatic focus on what is actually of communal use and has actual power to change people\u2019s lives for the better. &amp; care is a vital goal. Enacting possibilities with a sense of play towards a focused purpose of enlarging our skills for care &amp; supportive community is\u00a0useful.\n\nSo a mix of game + pragmatic focus\u00a0on care +\u00a0working with aspects of real community (whether it\u2019s living together differently, or working with the realities of the wider city / region) inspired me. &amp; using playful techniques in the city - I don't personally have time to produce an audio journey but there are more spontaneous acts - like clowning - that don't need much prep ie. going out on the streets and giving people gifts.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ve got to hand my PHD draft in September &amp; will work out what I can bring to this meeting - workshops or VR project &amp; very open to connect\u00a0with Gehan / Bernard / Frank about health / mental health / spritituality / love .\u00a0\u00a0Available for calls if you need me. I unfortunately don\u2019t have a block of time before the event to build something but perhaps it\u2019s the beginning of a longer journey.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ll be there in October - wherever it is held - and participate with all I got.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-07-19 18:20:47", "updated_at": "2017-09-19 14:08:09.044434", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 836, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 62.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33304, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 6504, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a0bf90f73cd3c6b9baf9ee208f35ba9559da6d2d.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"459\">\n\n<h2 align=\"center\" class=\"content-section\"><strong>Rachel Aronoff</strong></h2>\n\nFacilitator at \\#OpenVillage Festival\n\n<em>#genetics \\#opensource \\#neuroscience \\#biohacking \\#DoItTogether \\#research \\#learning</em>\n\n<em>I\u2019m a biologist and my big passion is looking into the different things that we can choose to avoid, that aren\u2019t good for our health.

She\u2019s a research scientist with a PhD in microbiology (UW, Seattle, USA) and one of the Co-Presidents at Hackuarium, an open biolab hosted by UniverCit\u00e9, a 'hub of innovation\u2019 in Renens, Switzerland, including a MakerSpace, FabLab and co-working space.\n\nAt \\#OpenVillage, Rachel is hosting a workshop on DIT (do it together) <a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micronucleus_test&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1500453569166000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHfAc8sBajfZsmOTesChkbu4MrisA\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micronucleus_test\" target=\"_blank\">micronucleus testing</a>, where participants are paired up to assess their baseline levels of DNA damage and help each other analyse results. She says anyone can participate by collecting cells with toothbrushes, staining and observing them. The bigger challenge is to make sure to count enough cells for statistical analysis (500 to 1000).\n\n<strong>What's the potential of opensourcing DNA damage tests?</strong>\n\nThis is relevant for health protection. We would understand better how the choices we make influence our health, and risks associated with it. At the very basic level, people who start doing it might think about: \u201chow can I change my lifestyle?\u201d Just like you use a Fitbit app (tracks your physical exercising), you might think: \u201coh, how many micronuclei do I have today?\u201d  \n\nWhile it is educative, the method has some way to go to be self-contained. The reasons have to do with the complex correlations with lifestyle choices and also data analyses. Another issue is confidentiality - participants would need to provide as much information as they think is relevant for a correlative analysis. But we are still learning what might impact genomic integrity most. For instance, smoking damages DNA directly and prevents its repair, another reason it is most highly-correlated risk factor for both ageing and disease. Not least, taking this testing further also means figuring how to avoid using compounds that might damage the environment themselves. For instance, the methylene blue used to stain cheek cells to see micronuclei might also impact genomic integrity, so should not just be poured down the drain. We are trying to make protocols based on \u2018kitchen sink ingredients\u2019 that will still allow us to do the micronucleus assay and another test for DNA breaks in cells, the comet assay.\n\nRachel\u2019s workshop is part of the Citizen Science and Open Science track at \\#OpenVillage.

As per @nadia's suggestion, I think they would be a very exciting next speaker! \n\nFollowing our meeting on Monday with @katejsim, @johncoate and @alberto, we discussed a few tweaks to the AMA that we think will help make the next one even more in-depth:\n\n[quote=\"katejsim, post:9, topic:14624\"]\nStrategies for making AMA discussion more in-depth:\n\n* Extend beyond one hour for live portion. Half day?\n* Make the introduction post more substantive\n* Ask speakers to answer some questions in the days leading up to spark more interesting discussions during the live session\n* Prep speakers to consider policy implications. One way to do this is to phrase policy questions differently since speakers may not feel they have much to say about \u201cpolicy.\u201d For example: \u201cIf you could wave a magic wand, what would you want to see?\u201d; \u201cWhat are the biggest obstacles? What makes them difficult and what do you want to see instead?\u201d; \u201cIf you could do this again, how would you do it differently?\u201d\n[/quote]\n\nI have integrated most of these points into my email to Emmi, asking them to begin answering questions before the event goes live and to check in a few times after the event to answer lingering questions. I asked them to write a brief (1-2 paragraph) description that is substantive enough for the community to engage with. I also prepped them that many community questions might be policy-focused, and to consider this in their description and the ensuing discussion.\n\nI did opt to keep the live AMA to an hour, as I am not sure we can ask people to stay on for much longer - however, I hope that if they engage with questions before and after, this will make the conversation more in-depth.\n\nAs soon as I hear back from them I will let you know - with the aim of being able to confirm a date by Friday (if they respond in time). Should Emmi not be available for the AMA, we will ask the speaker @MariaEuler suggested (and with whom she is already in contact), and whose work fits in nicely with many of the threads we have going around tech and education. \n\nWill keep you all posted!", "created_at": "2020-11-18 16:56:22.834002", "updated_at": "2020-11-18 16:56:22.834002", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 414, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 82.4, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [87052], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 4934, 5479, 2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33302, "user_id": 3622, "topic_id": 6502, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6793ad36f3588e8d64d281601f2e047e4106dc2a.jpg\" width=\"531\" height=\"500\">\n\nI thought we would take a moment this week to look at the amazing devices and initiatives that have been documented in our OpenCare stories group through the <a href=\"/t/call-for-applications-opencare-maker-in-residence/785\">Maker in Residence program</a> at WeMake.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>@breathinggames designs respiratory health games and devices.

Since one of the major leverage that public administrations can use to include private partners in public policies is to finance them with taxpayers' money (to keep it simple, I will not mention PPPs, which also have pitfalls), they need to make rational, fair and transparent decisions. This is where public procurement rules apply. However, strict rules often lead to standard, controlled and predictable output.

This is very hard for local governments to do, because giving communities space requires, paradoxically, for them to behave in a way that might appear arbitrary. Why are we letting people do things in this park, but not that square over there? Because the people who are interested in this park are aligned with the spirit of contribution to public good,\u00a0<em>and</em>\u00a0they\u00a0have capability to deliver. Who says so? We do. This is the polar opposite of @Matteo 's \"strict rules often lead to standard, controlled and predictable output\": if you, as a government,\u00a0open yourself to bottom-up innovation you pay a price in terms of strict rules.\n\nIn David Graeber's book on debt there is an aside that stayed with me, and might solve the policy maker's dilemma. It is well known that Imperial China invented bureaucrats. The Mandarins were civil servants, centrally selected on the basis of merit and centrally trained. But they were not given a rulebook to apply. China is big, and communications were poor and slow; also, it was very unstable, with peasant revolts sprouting out every year.\u00a0The Emperors knew that Mandarins would be on their own in distant provinces, and they would need to take quick action to prevent and quell revolts. So, they were trained in Confucian ethics rather than \"law\" as we understand it, and instructed to do their best to make sure the people were content and did not starve.\n\nIn modern terms, their operating mode was result-oriented rather than process-oriented, and buttressed by ethics rather than rules. I think Amartya Sen's work shows that this would be enough to ensure accountability. Which means, governments could, in principle, be hierarchical\u00a0<em>and</em>\u00a0creative\u00a0<em>and</em>\u00a0accountable. But that's not easy to do in process-oriented, formalistic legal systems and cultures.\u00a0\n\nIs this something we could be discussing? Maybe invite someone from UNDP?\n\n", "created_at": "2017-07-20 08:43:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:03.834883", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 407, "wiki": false, "reads": 23, "score": 4.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [33380], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 88944, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 13292, "post_number": 209, "raw": "Indonesians don\u2019t mess around.

What is the role of government? The 'operating system' plays a major role... It's almost\u00a0absurd to expect a\u00a0bureaucrat doing full time bureaucracy work to speak the language, know the needs etc. of projects that are relevant. Yet if the bureaucrat spends more time on oversight and less on command &amp; control, leaving the latter to the people who have experience in the field, it's probably more effective and\u00a0cheaper.\n\nAnother thing I've been thinking about in the context of Open Insulin. Leaving aside if Open Insulin is the right approach, consider any project that is a long shot, ambitious and with a potential big impact on many parts of the world. It's hard to disagree (in my opinion) with long shots for systemic changes in eg. pharma industry, based on ethics. I haven't met anyone who is against it\u00a0<em>in principle</em>, also not in government.\n\nThough only a smaller part of such an impact is realised in the city where the project resides. In my experience, a city wants to support projects that have an impact in their city, the impact beyond that is of minor importance. Or, more extreme, they will deliberately not\u00a0support you so that you go search funding up the chain, such as regional grant, because that results in an inflow of money into the city from elsewhere.\n\nNot so popular to be funded by the city, due to the above, but also because they would\u00a0rather support projects with an\u00a0<em>immediately\u00a0visible </em>impact, such as helping disadvantaged children or establishing a development aid link with an African town. This is of course great, but it is a form of symptom treatment, and for the cynical, mainly about the funder's next election cycle. Policy now seems more about\u00a0adding new rules and exceptions to help very specific groups who have been disadvantaged, rather than taking ambitions decisions that address the root and affect everyone - from the same disadvantaged to the shrinking group of privileged people - to change the legacy of outdated rules. It should be a balance, naturally, but it's way skewed to the wrong side now.\n\nA trick is to tie some concrete city level impact to the project - I guess OpenRampette would be a good example. Yet this is not always possible, especially in more complex projects.\n\nHigher up there's also close to no room for eg. an Open Insulin\u00a0in more formal and bigger funding programs. Rigid structures, but also lots of lobbying going on from, in the case of Open Insulin, big pharma. There, your chances are tiny and attempts are expensive. Ping @Lucy , maybe you can also pitch in.\n\nPersonally I see potential in the role of the city, just because there seems to be more room to be creative for those who dare. These long shot projects are not expensive in money either, especially considering the potential outcome. If five girls &amp; guys in their garage can have a shot at changing an industry, imagine what a city could do.\u00a0How badass would it be to read in the newspaper: \"The city of Milan supports open source treatment for diabetes induced blindness\".\n\nSo should a city support what emerges in their city, even if the impact is proportionately realised mainly outside the city? Considering they are dead in the water\u00a0elsewhere, is it <em>ethical</em>\u00a0not to support these projects at a city level?\n\n", "created_at": "2017-07-20 13:36:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:03.852706", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 645, "wiki": false, "reads": 21, "score": 54.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [33380], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33399, "user_id": 2470, "topic_id": 6252, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>November 11th</b>\n\nAs I will arrive in Milan November 9th I strongly prefer to have the consortium meeting the 11th.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-07-14 15:11:35", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:03.874956", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 24, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 18.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3520], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33407, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 1634, "post_number": 18, "raw": "Is it a matter of risk for them having you inside (why? why would you be perceived as a less stable employees?)

Later, when we got our basics more stabilized and were doing more \"branching out\" into various enterprises, as well as dealing with a growing population including kids, the role of a central bank grew in importance (all money was pooled) and the power built into the banker role became stronger. As always, you follow the money.  And, as gets often pointed out including in that article, it's just a lot more effective if a crew has a boss. But we dd not want to have those roles be too fixed. So we used the term \"strawboss\" that suggests a more temporary position. And it is true - we often did switch around where one person is the other's boss and then later the roles reversed.  But, over time some individuals emerged as the true long term leaders.  \n\nOne of those leaders, a lifelong farmer and head of the large 50+ farming crew, conceived and pitched the idea that we could grow our farming business to the point of profitability because we had so much labor available.  So they, along with the guru and a few others (heads of crews that brought in income like publishing as well as our community lawyer), decided to sign for the loans.  I remember being at the motor pool, which was midway along the road one day in 1974 when a trio of brand new big farming tractors drove down the road with our guys driving.  I shouted \"hey whose tractors are those?\" \"Ours!\" one shouted.  \"Huh?  How did that happen?\" I thought.  (Prior to that we had bought smaller used tractors that didn't cost that much.)\n\nAs it turned out, the farming scheme did not earn out anywhere close to what was predicted or hoped.\nAlso, on another front involving decision making and the whole community, we got pretty famous for telling people not to have an abortion but to come to have their baby delivered at the Farm and if you want you can keep it or we'll help with adoption.  That program was something that impacted the entire community but frankly it was not something that we the people had much choice in deciding.  I admit I didn't think about it that much at the time.  And we were mostly all proud of being of such large level public service.  But it was really expensive, esp if it was a couple and the father didn't work much.  \n\nI, back then though, was much less concerned with governance and more interested in the day-to-day being with everyone and living out my young adulthood as part of a grand adventure.  So, when I saw those tractors and got that response I thought, \"hmm..well, ok I guess.  They must know something I don't.\"  Instead of \"WTF they are doing things like that in my name without telling me first?\"  Now of course I would be more on the WTF side of things.  I guess one lesson here is, don't look to my experience there for a lot about what structure is best and the fine details of governance.  What I know about that all came later.\n\nWe back then were good at broader things like maintaining an extraordinary low level of violence in a group that large.  We were good at recognizing and growing positive sparks in each other.  We started out being really serious with each other and over time developed a vast and sophisticated collective sense of humor that lasts to this day.  We had rock and roll parties where I, from the stage, remember looking out at about 300 people and I know every one of them by their first name, all rocking to an inch of their lives.  We shared like nothing I ever saw before or since.  \n\nBut long-term governance?  Not so great while it was a collective with pooled money.  Coincidence?

It was precisely _you_ I was writing for, along with a few others, so it is very gratifying to see the message landed well. And thanks to @johncoate for sharing some of your experiences here. \n\n@noemi if I made it sound like blank slates are a good place to start, I have misrepresented myself. Interesting stuff can emerge from a blank slate, but my own experience is rooted in an ancient lineage, different wisdom traditions, a messy genealogy of overlapping elders, who have each taught the subsequent generation their spotty recollection of methods, poorly translated and misunderstood, but still animated with a quality of aliveness that shines through despite the shortcomings.\n\nI thought I was just experimenting with one new community, but I'm beginning to sense I might actually be experimenting with a community development protocol. I may be articulating something at the same level as say Art of Hosting or Theory U.\n\nMy instinctive posture is *against* protocol, against the abstraction, articulation and comparison of different models. I have had so many experiences of these conversations rapidly departing from bodies and actions. Intellectually stimulating but practically unsatisfying. I hope to proceed in a more embodied, more active, less academic sense. \n\nI have been documenting my journey with Enspiral and Loomio for 7 years. I'm still not sure if that documentation has done a great deal of good. E.g. the [Enspiral Handbook](http://handbook.enspiral.com) has the letter of the law but none of the spirit. Discerning the spirit from the letter is a mystic art, as far as I'm concerned.\n\nI don't think you can learn much about *doing* this stuff by *reading* about it. It's like trying to dance about a painting; interesting maybe, but not very effective. I think the personal stories are more helpful than the rulebooks, but then the stories don't satisfy the people who keep asking me *where do I start?*\n\nI believe we learn much more by mimicry than by reading. So lately I've been saying, *start by finding someone who's feet you want to sit at*. Or, *find a relationship you want to emulate, and ask if they'll teach you how.* There is a such a subtle quality of our interpersonal relating, it's mostly impossible to detect through writing. But when we are physically present with each other, it is effortless to start copying: *oh in this space people seem to maintain eye contact, speak without interrupting each other, they pay careful attention to each other's emotional and physical boundaries, they seem to anticipate each other's needs*. My putting it into words can distract from the doing of it.\n\nIn my experience so far, face-to-face contact is the easiest way to pass these qualities along. I'm not giving up on the written word though, just feeling out the size of the challenge I've set for myself.\n\nSo this is a question for @noemi (and others): if you want to focus more on partnership within ER, do you have specific examples of relationships you want to emulate? Have you participated in a relationship that had certain qualities you would like to see more of in ER?\n\nMany times in Europe I met people who seemed to move with the assumption that they needed to find the best ideas, come up with the perfect design, and then it would be time to start. Enspiral has a terrible design, it barely works, but it works enough for us to keep learning from doing.

For me, hope lies in the emerging groups (\"crews\") around the world who are actively working towards better ways of relating to each other and the planet. I am convinced that, very soon such groups (and I think of Enspiral, Ouishare and Edgeryders as some of the pioneers in this space)  will need to become more visible.

My sense from having read about these \"eco dreams\" (no pun intended) or projects-in-the-making, including Victor Vorski's which I'm not sure even if it has kicked off at the physical level!), is that there arent resources and a clear framework in place - maybe the land, or some production facility and skills to start with etc..

Considering that the much of Internet infrastructure is built on free software and open source technologies, it makes me wonder \"What if we would organize the infrastructure development of the Internet in a similar manner?\". To do this by gathering companies, government, civil society and have open and collaborative processes in order to include a multitude of perspectives of this complex issue and overcome the challenges causing devastating consequences for societies, organizations and humans. \n\nI do not know of any projects working on the organising of society in relation to the internet, only W3C and IETF working on technical collaboration and standardization. My interest in this is mainly in connection to the recent developments and consequences from the Internet that people can experience in their daily offline life or when surfing the World Wide Web.\n\nSpecific events I'm thinking about are examples such as the Cambridge Analytica scandal with Facebook and how similar events have happened. These are having a big effect on societies and democratic processes, at least in the representative democratic processes such as election. In that sense we are experiencing consequences of an Internet that is continuously being developed but we do not know how, when it is done, it's simply having an impact on us as human beings, with potential large scale negative consequences.\n\nThe consequences can mostly be loosely drawn as humans and scientific research can't really keep up with the silo-based, non-coordinated nature and speed of development, making it harder to connect the dots between source of change and consequences. \n\nMy hopes are that we can gather a group of organizations and individuals from different sectors of society who are willing to collaborate and take a more holistic approach, a systems thinking approach on building a Internet infrastructure which serves humans and society as a whole. \n\nPerhaps establishing an ongoing collaboration with experimentation and action for the development of Internet with discussions and analysis happening when the group designs and reflects on experiments that are to be tested or have been tested. \n\nThese thoughts and my background leading up to this is mainly based on my experience as a human. In this information society it becomes more evident and feels like a lot of actors are acting independantly and unknowing, or not caring, of the different directions they are pulling toward, and the consequences which come from everybody trying to pull in different directions. It gets easy to create a sensation of chaos. \n\nI believe that this goes for a majority of challenges we are facing, climate, mental health, economy. It's basically the Wild West whereas I believe that many expressions we can see on the Internet are symptoms of this experience for many people. \n\nI think that with the current information overload many people have, that can really pacify a lot of us. \n\nI think we're at an interesting point in this time in which these big challenges are becoming more and more transparent, evident and tangible. We need to take a new approach in order to show that we can overcome these challenges, prove that a new approach can be done and then overcome all of these in parallel. \n\nI strongly believe that this is more of a challenge of how we organize the work with these common challenges as a society rather than finding one or many technological solutions to all of it. Technological solutions solve technological challenges.\n\n<< Message from your Edgeryders host: Newcomers - please [sign up](https://communities.edgeryders.eu/login) and join the conversation! >>", "created_at": "2019-04-17 14:45:03.873567", "updated_at": "2020-12-14 19:50:29.661301", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 631, "wiki": false, "reads": 58, "score": 438.6, "like_count": 7, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4022, 5, 4265, 8, 4861, 5604, 4934], "is_private": false}, {"id": 79125, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 13896, "post_number": 7, "raw": "Hey Philip, great point, but... are you sure it should go here?

A combination of economic and social crises in Athens since 2011 has generated a large number of projects developed by civil society organisations, social movements and creative individuals. Many of these remain quite fragile. An umbrella organisation created to help support such initiatives is called SynAthina, a community platform  which may be of interest to you.

The first team get-together was held on 7th of January \u2013 an informal, short check-in. These will be organized every second Monday at 17:00 CET to enable the attendees to share relevant updates or ask any clarifications on these H2020 research projects as @anique.yael explained at the beginning of the meeting.\n\n\n\n\nThe following was shared:\n\n* @alberto addressed the project proposal for DT-GOVERNANCE-13-2019: Digitisation, Digital Single Market and European culture: new challenges for creativity, intellectual property rights and copyright. The proposal is ongoing, the work packages need to be negotiated, but the outline is ready. The [concept note](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AC5OskB6nhx_F23QcKoJrsVu5X1-RC0w9nr5p5ZhJqc/edit) was written by Alberto. It is necessary to work on the budget to attach the price to each of the tasks. This can be done by cloning the already existing work budget template. @anique.yael will coordinate with @alberto on this. \n\n* @noemi has been working with @john on the London training and on getting the people on the platform. There will be 10 participants, not only direct community managers but also people from all partners. Jan (the principal investigator from the UCL \u2013 the driver and scientific lead) is the key person involved and very engaged. Richard (the head of the school at UCL) is mentoring Jan through the process and acting as the key support. The question was brought up on the stage of building the platform and the issue of dealing with multiple languages. The people are usually encouraged to use their own language, so the way of using the platform should be very clear (it shouldn\u2019t be expected to have one-language portal). \n\n* @anique.yael explained that in terms of the launch it is not possible to go live until the first deliverable is approved (related to the ethics and impact plan) \u2013 it was clear in the agreement that the platform will be going live in the month 3 of the project. On the technical side @matthias said it is fast to setup, good to go basically. There will be one major change that affects the log in (related to the wide level platforms) which should be tested before going live. Regarding languages \u2013 we have to care about the multilingual coding. \n\n* @john pointed out community managers should have a decent knowledge of English but nevertheless, the language should not be an obstacle for everyone to fully engage in discussions. It was agreed that the questions on multiple language fora need to be addressed in the separate discussion since it is the task of community managers, so @noemi will tackle this with @john. \n\n* @anique.yael prepared the contracts for all the team leaders to review. Should there be any questions feel free to communicate with her in the form you feel most comfortable with.\n\n* @alberto introduced @marina - new hire in the research network. She will spend the first few months to learn, get you know you and be exposed to what we do. She will be in London next week.\n\n* London meetings: informal dinner will be held on Monday evening, the trainings on Thursday and Friday, and @john and @anique.yael will atted the NGI kick off the following Monday. \n\n* It will be necessary to log in expenses in the Free Agent - @matthias confirmed that it is possible to log in the expense without it being on paying waitlist: the expense can be put in but the reimbursement has to be requested only once you have receipts and once the kick off is done. @anique.yael will make a post about the kick off and link to @matthias.\n\n* @alberto has done a post about the presentations and asked for reviews and inputs \u2013PROPREBEL needs to be done soon \u2013 one two slides, for this week.\n\n* @alberto, @anique.yael and @marina will catch up on the campaign for 2019 and look at various proposals today (8/1).", "created_at": "2019-01-08 11:56:20.523443", "updated_at": "2019-01-08 14:44:50.252216", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 687, "wiki": true, "reads": 19, "score": 243.8, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 3, 3904], "is_private": false}, {"id": 76727, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 13537, "post_number": 2, "raw": "ping @martin, is this interesting for you?", "created_at": "2020-05-18 10:58:26.375304", "updated_at": "2020-05-18 10:58:26.375304", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 7, "wiki": false, "reads": 21, "score": 19.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 45, "user_id": 4922, "topic_id": 37, "post_number": 1, "raw": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-9z0i5fuvE\n\n## We use advanced analytics to drive our work \u2013 and enhance yours\n\nCollective intelligent behavior is a network phenomenon.

This work is the result of several interviews conducted with coworking space managers, aspiring, new and experienced entrepreneurs  during the last 3 months \n\n\n## 1. First impressions\n\nThe presentations of the benefits of joining our platform, the Open Village concept and our projects were a huge success among our interviewees. We explained how our collaboration could fit their professional projects which fueled their curiosity to visit our platform immediately to explore its content. \n\n_**Recommendations:**_\n\n* Enabling registration directly through Facebook profile or Google address  could make the user experience friendlier.\n\n* In order to draw attention to the activities organized by the community, it is preferable to highlight events such as the open festival village, social innovation camp... \n\n\n## 2. Online community engagement\n\nThe majority of the interviewees who have already subscribed to Edgeryders platform spend most of their time discovering the content rather than producing content. Their withdrawal from contributing to the discussions could be explained by the poor English language skills of a significant number of the subscribers since English is a third language in Tunisia after Arabic and French. Moreover, documenting and reporting are not a common practice in the Tunisian professional environment. However, I think we must be more welcoming and engaging to the new members of the platform by opening discussions on MENA oriented subjects. \n\n_**Recommendations**_\n\n* Since the community is growing, it is becoming more challenging to match members of the platform manually. Integrating an artificial intelligence to invite members to interact with each other on subjects of their interest could enrich our discussions.\n\n* It is preferable to integrate an API that translates the content to give the platform a multilingual dimension. This could help members of our community to ignore the language barrier and widens the range of our discussions. \n\n\n## 3. User profiling\n\nTaking into consideration the possible distinguishment between two types of community members: content creator and inactive community members (readers), there are two possible ways to develop thecommunity. We could help convert inactive members into content producers or simply provide good content to attract more 'readers' (inactive community members).\n\n_**The online community calls experience**_\n\nWe have organized seven community calls. The guests are mainly from Egypt and Tunisia. \n\n_**Outcomes of the Community Calls in Tunisia**_\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Guest</th>\n    <th>Topic</th>\n    <th>Outcomes</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Yosser Belghith</th>\n    <td>Offline community development for coworking spaces</td>\n    <td>The online community call was an opportunity for Hugi and Yosser to meet and co-organise a hackathon in OurGhema.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Dorsaf Nasseur</th>\n    <td>How to bootstrap your biohacking space</td>\n    <td>Dorsaf and Winnie (community member) had a funding agreement with the partners of a biohacking space in Belgium.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Syrine Bousslema</th>\n    <td>Data collection and prototyping an AI platform</td>\n    <td>After the community call, Syrine was contacted by an inactive member of the platform, Salem Jedidi, who invited her to participate in a hackathon organized by the company he works for as data scientist. Syrine won the hackathon and she landed a one year contract with the hackathon host company to consolidate her AI skills and to launch her project later.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n\n## 4. Community development perspectives\n\n* **Edgeryders Social Innovation Lab** is a laboratory for positive social change inspired from the community calls that Edgeryders community members have been carrying out for years and which have borne fruit in many socio-economic contexts, particularly in Europe and North Africa. The lab involves a diversity of stakeholders concerned about social issues: state actors, private companies and foundations, associations, universities, and people directly affected by the subject (citizens, users).\n\n    By networking this ecosystem of people, a realistic perspective of the community issues will be projected through the Edgeryders Platform. Such perspective helps inspiring the lab innovations driving the social development thanks to the collaboration of the diverse cultures and expertise of the Edgeryders Platform members. \n\n*  **Edgeryders Students Brunch:** We noticed that the majority of the participants of the workshops and events are students. Such demographic is important for the future of the platform. Edgeryders Students Brunch could be an extension of Edgeryders Social innovation Camp independently organized by students: a way to extend our social change makers community and to allow more people to contribute to the conversation. \n\n* **XLab:** A local one day lab that helps dissect a social problem and look for the different possible solutions.\n\n@noemi @johncoate @alberto @hazem @hugi Your  feed backs and recommendations will be highly appreciated.", "created_at": "2019-01-09 16:24:53.668494", "updated_at": "2020-07-20 13:40:17.391878", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 775, "wiki": false, "reads": 23, "score": 264.6, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 8, 4022, 4204], "is_private": false}, {"id": 49966, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 9341, "post_number": 3, "raw": "First pass at concept note done, but input welcome.

I find it very strong. For this week, @anique.yael and I should start pushing it out, looking to join a consortium in formation.\n\n2. @noemi has expressed interest for the *Societal challenges and the arts * topic (TRANSFORMATIONS-17-2019). That is clearly a great fit for the Culture Crew. During the holidays, I had a meet with Lu\u00eds, and he agreed (enthusiastically) to partner up with us on that. He is expecting Edgeryders to lead on the concept, whereas he will do the heavy lifting on the consortium formation.

Because everyone will have experience of dealing with healthcare for example. And then that person it turns out is really interested in something completely different, and can offer unexpected support to someone else's project. \n\nOur approach has been to do a series of \"campaigns\" - calls for people interested in (add the topic for that call here). Give some examples from the edgeryders platform of work others are doing related to it and then ask others who have experience of the topic to join the call. That is how many participants came to find this community - the perfect example being the work we did with OpenCare.\n\n\nYou will find a complete list of topics, and if you look further below you will find that Anu has tagged every peice of content on the platform with one or more tags corresponding to the topic list; https://edgeryders.eu/t/what-we-care-about/6978", "created_at": "2019-01-21 11:56:46.957771", "updated_at": "2019-01-21 11:56:46.957771", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 227, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 32.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [50016], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 50024, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 9343, "post_number": 7, "raw": " One for @simona.fit & @Val.Muresan : this is a great case study for Timisoara I believe, as Medenine (Tunisia) has been going for over a year, with lots to learn!\nI am happy to setup a call with Zmorda and you, perhaps after my next visit of TeaM21 :yum:(!)\nAlso pinging others interested in getting their communities online, including @MariaS @sebquack @konstantinaz @g.ferri for Trust in Play new edgeryders platform: https://trustinplay.edgeryders.eu/ (work in progress)", "created_at": "2019-01-11 06:55:14.821944", "updated_at": "2019-01-11 07:16:53.626472", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 78, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 13.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 88536, "user_id": 6953, "topic_id": 14773, "post_number": 137, "raw": "**What alternative currencies/currency-rules you think should be experimented?** <br /> Before you get to the currency, let's understand what we need currency / currencies for.\n\nThat depends on the choice of social and economic organization you are assuming.

I'm not sure if the society is changing, and more people talk about it, or if it's that more and more people are struggling with this'*.  She adds that *'nowadays on social media there is a dictatorship of ideas such as being creative, learning new things, but there are people struggling with existential things - like keeping a job. You have to have your basic needs fulfilled for you to be able to dream or do some other things. There are stories I want to pursue about people who have ideas, and try to create new things, but stories of hardships are very relevant.

Or did you start from the tech, from things that would be made possible if you only had that piece of tech?\n[/quote]\n\nThe software came before the festival, as a part of a long process of thinking and discussing what we want to experiment with.\n\nOur background is more of an artistic / theoretical one (we started with a group of musicians, composers and students) and technology plays only one part in this. We love to question, play with and experiment with frameworks in general (we see Universities, Curation, Funding, Art, Technology and so on as frameworks) so in this sense we are not necessarily interested in making things \"easier\" through technology, but rather put ourselves in a (partly technological, strange) environment where we can discuss and experiment with.\n\nSo maybe we didn't \"start\" from tech, as it was a very interweaved process of many thoughts from all angles but surely we use tech to realize some of these thoughts (Anonymity, self-organization). Also we develop new software for everything we do, so this is also maybe interesting to highlight.\n\nI guess the BLATT 3000 \"festivals\" are hardly festivals, maybe they are more something like art projects in themselves :smile: (to make things even more confusing). :blush:", "created_at": "2019-01-24 12:54:54.713089", "updated_at": "2019-01-24 12:54:54.713089", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 396, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 58.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [50304], "is_reply_to": [50304], "is_liked_by": [4022], "is_private": false}, {"id": 50305, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 9422, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c1ded46e36b382a10fed4fb192a52e62d5df21cc.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"257\">\n\nI am returning home from the kickoff meeting on a new project. Something interesting happened there: for reasons that I won't go into right now, the partners find it inappropriate to do our online collaboration on proprietary tools and cloud services owned by stacks ([GAFAM](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAFAM)). This turned out to be practically impossible. We do have repositories for papers and deliverables (zenodo.org); we do have the Edgeryders platform for conversation. Other things turned out to be hard.\n\n1. **Collaborative document editing**. There is still little in the way of replacements to Google Docs. Some people in the group had tried [Cryptpad](https://cryptpad.fr/), but not liked it. Elsewhere, @ton suggested [Collabora](https://nextcloud.com/collaboraonline/). Several alternatives were proposed, from Overleaf (will we be writing our notes in LaTEX?) to versioned Libre Office Documents circulated over email. I would propose there ARE some alternatives, as long as you are prepared to go minimal over features (which is good for you anyway). For example, Etherpad has become quite beatiful, a bit like the Hackpad of old. Some disadvantages, of course: it saves in SQLite, so even if you download a backup you won't be able to do anything with it. It is part of [Sandstorm](https://sandstorm.io/get), which is self-hostable (and includes an app for Jupyter Notebook, which looks real-time collaborative too).\n\n2. **Cloud archival**. We are talking here of humble documents. Certainly not papers, not even project deliverables (those go on Zenodo). But the minutes from the meeting, the working document, the unfinished draft, the picture. Most orgs use Google Drive, or Dropbox, or Office in the Cloud. Again, not so many alternatives here (Ton likes [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/)) In the end, we solved this one with... FTP :slight_smile: . \n\n3. **Event registration**. Do we even need a non-evil Eventbrite alternative? It is not clear to me. Among other things, those data are problematic from a GDPR point of view. My suggestion of going back to the Barcamp tradition (run events through a wiki, people \"register\" by writing their name into a wikified list of attendees) was not met by much enthusiasm. :smile:\n\nSo, here is where we are. If you want to go non-evil in our everyday workflow, you need to make quite some efforts, and it is not even clear you can find a proper solution.

Without putting laypersons to sleep or being patronising as the characters themselves are in a similar position as the viewer...\n\n\"This week, Diane, Adrian, and Julius represent a black undercover police officer named Rashid Clarkson, who was shot and crippled by another cop during a drug sting. This pits them up against supposedly legendary lawyer Solomon Waltzer (Alan Alda), who is representing Det. Whitehead, the officer who shot Rashid, and the Chicago Police Department. But Diane and Adrian aren\u2019t too impressed by him because they\u2019re easily winning the case, especially after Kurt walks the jury through the ballistic evidence at the scene of the crime, and for some odd reason, Solomon doesn\u2019t raise any objections. They take it as a sign that he\u2019s going senile, but if you\u2019ve watched The Good Fight, you probably spent the entire episode waiting for the shoe to drop, and it does.\n\nInstead of objecting in court, Solomon questions Rashid about dogfighting, pointing to an article that claimed he was being investigated for holding such fights in his backyard. Rashid maintains that isn\u2019t true, even though Solomon has an article stating it is. Of course, Marissa is the one who figures out what\u2019s going on after she struggles to find more than one article with those claims. She goes back to the jury research, creates a Facebook profile with all the jurors\u2019 characteristics, and discovers that someone paid to target people with the same characteristics as the jurors with that fake news article \u2014 in other words, microtargeting. Solomon is obviously the one behind this fake news article, and it\u2019s not the only one he\u2019s sent out into the world.\" - Source https://ew.com/recap/the-good-fight-season-2-episode-8/\n\nIf you come across/ remember other pieces of popculture/media content please feel free to post them as comments below so we get a nice compilation...", "created_at": "2019-02-01 11:11:17.683084", "updated_at": "2019-02-01 11:12:14.464744", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 382, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 21.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 50594, "user_id": 104, "topic_id": 9451, "post_number": 11, "raw": "Thanks @alberto  Yes, definite interest from me too.

Be as fair as you can, step in early and try the light touch first, because sometimes people just need to say their peace.\n\nAlso, if, by the time you step in, all sides have settled down, acknowledge that they have, and just comment that you're glad that they were able to handle it (treat them like adults)\n\nOne or more sides feel that there is cliquishness\n\nThis is hard to combat because there will be regular long-time people, people who drop in and out, and new people.\n\nAll you can do is encourage mingling.\n\nYou want to be very careful in declaring certain topics \"VERBOTEN\", as people will quickly learn to get uncivil if they want a topic shut down.\n\nWorse, this can become a tactic to drive people out especially when it becomes a tactic to scold people for bringing up a controversial topic.\n\nThe old standard admonition of \"Please don't feed the troll\" helps as well.\n\nThe best way to keep controversy from becoming an issue is to look for those who seek to make it one.\n\nThese are not necessarily those people spoiling for a fight, but rather the people who are egging others on.\n\nONCE YOU FIND A COMMUNITY DIVIDED\n\nYou need to crack down on the incivility first. That will stop the bleeding so to speak.\n\nThen, you promote discussion where there is common ground. The key is to get people talking again.\n\nAfter that, you will find the community cooling down a bit, and you can start to re-introduce a few hot-button topics, but enforce civility very strictly until it becomes habit.", "created_at": "2019-02-13 22:03:06.350790", "updated_at": "2019-02-13 22:03:06.350790", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 582, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 22.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3704], "is_private": false}, {"id": 52057, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 9461, "post_number": 6, "raw": "Since we're at it: I just saw that Discourse itself also has a community management category on its Discourse forum:\n\nhttps://meta.discourse.org/c/community", "created_at": "2019-03-26 02:32:26.835233", "updated_at": "2019-03-26 02:32:26.835233", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 27, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 71.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 3704], "is_private": false}, {"id": 50611, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 9463, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Noted, thanks!", "created_at": "2019-02-05 15:26:39.485348", "updated_at": "2019-02-05 15:26:39.485348", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 12.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 50750, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 9463, "post_number": 7, "raw": "I like the plan to have NGI training then, and I am looking forward to sitting in on the community management training :)", "created_at": "2019-02-11 12:31:20.719537", "updated_at": "2019-02-11 12:31:20.719537", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 22, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 51.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [50748], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 50644, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 9464, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Thanks for posting Nat!

This helps spark more in-depth discussion during the live event.\n\nEdgeRyders has a very heterogeneous community from a range of disciplinary backgrounds and interests (activists, practitioners, academics, designers), and given the nature of our research, many are interested in the policy implications of current and emerging technologies.

We can start in English and take it from there. What was indicated in the GA (number of languages and number of community managers) can be changed if it is well justified and makes sense for the project.\n\n- As Nadia suggested, we can consider having one language and topics in other languages (one category per page and different topics in other languages, so people can choose to which one they wish to contribute). In this way, we do not need to separate the fora \u2013 the discussions could be posts all under one category. \n\n- The call for participants \u2013 they should be bilingual. In this way we can create quite large recruitment pool and have an option to recruit depending on the needs for languages, without making promises and starting with English. To be considered: the participants should be highly competent and with particular skills; hiring less but paying more, to assure the quality and focus on diversity and people we want to bring in.\n\n- An option to consider: link trainings to engagement, but in this case they would be later. This would allow reaching out to the tech scene and build a network. The content might be split in pre-selection (online) and preparing for the work (offline) happening after recruitment. \n\n- Location Brussels \u2013 advantages: possible collaborations with different universities (from Belgium, but also the Netherlands and the UK).\n\n**Action points:**  \n\n- discuss with the partners @johncoate \n\n- check what communities talk in which languages and if there is an added value to having multiple languages  @alberto \n- @johncoate will put up a core group\n\n- @amelia will prepare the call for ethnographers, rather general so on the basis of the applications received we will be able to decide if it needs refining", "created_at": "2019-02-19 11:43:14.187227", "updated_at": "2019-02-19 11:44:02.422074", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 378, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 72.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 87510, "user_id": 5059, "topic_id": 14632, "post_number": 57, "raw": "Thanks for setting this up @MariaEuler!

Ask me anything.\"\n\nTime: some time mid-November at 6.30pm CET\nWhat you need to do\n* Before: prepare a short paragraph of description \n* During: be online in our platform for an hour to answer

What languages do you think this new world might speak?\n\nTLDR : progressively all existing and future languages.\n\nI have been thinking about language for many years. My ideas about it are quite extensive. What I propose  does not exist yet, but I have roadmap for how to get there that is feasible with existing open source software. The roadmap involves several levels of software development coupled with concurent community of users building. It is a growth process needing a dynamic equilibrium between those two poles.\n\nThe central idea is a form of [Interlingual machine translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlingual_machine_translation) similar to [UNL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Networking_Language) but with the significant difference that the [pivot language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivot_language) is not fixed (and centralized) but dynamically extensible in a distributed manner. How to implement that is part of the roadmap, no miracles are needed, just work.\n\nOne reason that makes that possible is another big difference (with all machine translation programs that I know of) : the software does not translate preexisting text. The input is transactional. If the software does not \"understand\" a part of the input (that is to say cannot unambiguously translate it in the Pivot_language), it asks questions until it can. (For the user this works somewhat similar to a spell or grammar checker) \n\nThat difference is linked to another big difference : the purpose is mainly to be a tool for discussions (at all scales) : a tool for mutual understanding between agents having different backgrounds. Not translation of static \"dead\" texts. So there should be enough motivation to do a little work on the input.\n\nThis is an example of what \"dynamic growth process\" means : when the program has had to ask questions, it learns from the additional input. And what it has learned can propagate through the system, so a next user in a similar situation can be understood without questions. Pioneers (and pioneer communities) do the work that makes it easier for those that follow.\n\nAn example of development levels : at the start it will be text, voice would come later.", "created_at": "2020-12-08 02:09:46.252754", "updated_at": "2020-12-08 02:09:46.252754", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 370, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 37.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [6670, 4934], "is_private": false}, {"id": 88833, "user_id": 3816, "topic_id": 15068, "post_number": 6, "raw": "The anthology idea is great @steph!

Multi-lingual ethnographic coding role specification:\n\n\n\n![](http://factday.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Internet_smarter.jpg)\n\n\nThe **NGI Forward** project, part of the topic *Next Generation Internet - An Open Internet Initiative* is a EC Horizon 2020 project focused on developing a more human-centric Internet: supporting values of openness, cooperation across borders, decentralisation, inclusiveness and protection of privacy, as well as giving users the ability to help create an Internet they trust. We are focused on understanding people's own perspectives on the Internet and desired futures for it to inform long term strategies and policies. We intend to convene a large online conversation in which people discuss these issues, performing continuous ethnographic analysis on it. \n\nWe are looking to hire two or more ethnographers to collaborate with us on this project. This would run for about two years on a part-time basis (approximately 20% of your time). We think it would suit graduate students well, who might re-use the work for a thesis or papers (everything is open access), but we will consider any applicant. We have a total budget of about 57,600 Euro (the equivalent of one full time person). Depending on candidates, time commitment, and language capability, we can split this between 2-4 people.\n\n### Requirements:\n\n* Trained in the theory and practice of ethnography.\n* Comfortable performing online ethnography.\n* Experience with qualitative data analysis, specifically qualitative coding. The software is unimportant as we have our own, which you will be trained to use.\n* Ability to collaborate with other ethnographers coding the same dataset in different languages.\n* Flexibility and willingness to engage in productive dialogue around coding decisions\u2014 good communication skills are a must.\n* Strong organization skills -- must be available for weekly check-ins and document coding choices in a shared open codebook. \n* Good knowledge of English as well as fluency in one or more of the following languages: French, German, Italian, Polish.\n\n### Tasks\n\n* Code the conversations, using a tool we built in-house called Open Ethnographer.\n* Build an ontology of relevant codes, appropriate to ethnographic coding of the online conversation, and keep a detailed and organized codebook.\n* Collaborate with other ethnographers to maintain a consistent multi-language coding ontology.\n* Help to compile an ethnographic report at the conclusion of the project.\n* Participate in the discussion towards improving both Open Ethnographer and the SSNA methodology.\n\nThe kind of qualitative coding we do has an added element to it: we use the codes to build a social semantic network, mixing ethnography and network science to produce a visualisation of the convened conversation. Thanks to the ethnography, the network visualisation shows not only who is talking to each other (the social network), but also what they are talking about (the semantic network, built from ethnographic codes). This method of inquiry preserves the richness of conversation but provides a higher-level view and allows for some quantitative analyses. With social semantic network analysis (SSNA), we can identify networks of codes, and measure their cohesiveness; identify emergent networks of specialists, who interact around specific keywords; and validate individual contributors, among other applications (to learn more, [see here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/semantic-social-network-analysis-the-video/7939)).\n\nAs part of the role, you can also use the ethnographic/SSNA data to produce publications. In fact, we would encourage you to.\n\n### Workplace\n\nYou can do the work online, from wherever you are, but you will be requested to participate in one or more physical meetings. Your travel expenses for these meetings will be covered.\nIf you happen to be in Brussels or Stockholm, you can also come work at the Reef or Blivande (our workspaces), but that\u2019s not a requisite. We coordinate and communicate through the Edgeryders platform.\n\n**Must be available to attend a full-day practical interview/training in Brussels (expenses paid) in early April 2019. More hands-on fun with the method than an interrogatory experience, so don\u2019t stress.**\n\n### How to apply \n\nWrite to amelia@edgeryders.eu.

However, there is usually a fee to cover our overhead. I propose we make an exception in this case. When Edgeryders members run projects (even a single talk or seminar can be an isolated project) we have a 20% overhead that stays in ER to cover costs and new investment. A comparable situation would have been when Nadia and I gave a talk this summer, we accounted for this when calculating our speaker fee.\n\nIn this case, I don\u2019t think we should go by the 20% rule, since its mostly about helping you get out of a tight spot of not having the EU machinery set up for yourself yet. You are also not asking for any more of resources than my time, you are not in the habit of using ER resources, you won\u2019t be selling anything that ER has had a hand in building, and I\u2019m happy the help a friend out of a tight spot. I see this as a one-off, which would have been different if the plan had been to use ER from the get-go. We could do a smaller percentage, but for a small one-off that would be a petty amount.\n\nUnless there are principled objections to this among my fellow directors, I\u2019ll let the money pass straight through to you this time.

After agreeing on this, the call will be ready soon.\n\n- The POPREBEL platform is almost ready for launching, the community managers are finalizing the texts, waiting for green lights! \n\n- The calls for all trainings need to be put out this week.\n\n- Thematic concept for outreach and engagement which is working very well for POPREBEL, needs some fine tuning for NGI which is more expert oriented, in order to harmonize the themes. @johncoate and @nadia are having a call to discuss this on Wednesday.\n\n- **Alberto**: question about the consent funnel specifics \u2013 what happens with existing users and the funnel when the platform goes online? So far there is only one consent funnel and we will be able to identify new answers by date, but we should show the new questions to the people who sign up. This would mean erasing the old consent funnel data so that everybody is allowed to post again only once they answered the new consent funnel. Alberto will ask ethical advisors for about this. In the meantime, if it is not resolved until the launch of the platform, one sentence will be added explaining why this needs to be filled-in again (GDPR and change of policies). \n- Translating the consent funnel in other languages? It is possible by showing options in tabs and translating manually the questions and answers. Alberto, Natalia & others can help with translating in specific languages. \n\nWe have agreed to maintain the biweekly team meetings in March and decide in April whether to have them once a month, depending on the needs.", "created_at": "2019-03-05 11:03:40.349959", "updated_at": "2019-03-05 11:03:40.349959", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 400, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 67.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3323], "is_private": false}, {"id": 88829, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 14987, "post_number": 47, "raw": "**Posts by Members:**\n\nArticle: * [Startups\u2019 grand illusion: You have to be 10x better than whats there](https://edgeryders.eu/t/startups-grand-illusion-you-have-to-be-10x-better-than-whats-there/10221)\nCategory: **Work-livelihood-business**\nAuthor: @BlackForestBoi \nKey contributors: @Hama \n\nArticle: * [What Is to Be Done About the Ad-Based Internet economy?](https://edgeryders.eu/t/what-is-to-be-done-about-the-ad-based-internet-economy/9821)\nCategory: **Freedom-and-control** **Work-livelihood-business**\nAuthor: @johncoate \nKey contributors: @felix.wolfsteller @BlackForestBoi @inge @matthias @JollyOrc @erik_lonroth      \n\nArticle: * [Assorted thoughts about IT that I wish I knew when growing up ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/assorted-thoughts-about-it-that-i-wish-i-knew-when-growing-up/11985)\nCategory: **Work-livelihood-business**\nAuthor: @unclecj \nKey contributors: @unclecj @matthias @felix.wolfsteller   \n\nArticle: * [Hi I\u2019m Daveed!

When I try to imagine how this might work, I don't see it as four people independently managing the online spaces, and indeed I see team work implied strongly in the invitation, as the word \"team\" comes up more than once. So, rather than looking for four people each of whom have a complete skill set, would it be more effective and fruitful to look for four people who between them cover the required languages (that's obviously an essential) but most strongly, ones who both complement each other, and get on really well as a team?\n\nI see this as a theme coming up time and time again. To be really effective in any interesting, generative role, it seems to me vital that we act collectively in rapport with our other team members. Richard Bartlett has written extensively about \"microsolidarity\"; Ria Baeck has written an amazing book on \"Collective Presencing\", and we have examples like Percolab and Enspiral, as well as Edgeryders. So can we bring this kind of consideration into the selection process? Sure, it will be more demanding to assess how well people will fit together as a functioning team, but my guess is that any effort towards this will be very well rewarded in terms of the outcomes, both for the project and on a personal level for the people involved.\n\nDoes that make sense?

Image credit: a facebook group (to be id)_\n\nHi! Every time at Edgeryders we start a new project or build a new community I am digging into my life story from a new angle. I am Noemi, a longtime member and co-founder of Edgeryders back in the days. I will keep this version short: at 30 I walked straight into a personal life crisis and found myself in a systematic process of understanding where I come from.\n\n**I relocated to Brussels two years ago, and for the longest time I had been adamant about staying and possibly working in my own country. I was one of the last \u201cRomanian patriots\u201d,** @alberto used to joke. Member of the struggling middle class and living in one of the most developed cities, I and many of my peers built ourselves fairly good lives and many of them are successfully living in more traditional values - marriage, job, house, and bank loans by the time we are 30. All could be well, nothing against traditional culture. \n\nBut I found myself having to re-think everything due to the erosion in society that I saw happening. Erosion compared to what it should be, living in the 21st century. Of course, Romania has seen worst in communist times, yet for some of us values like freedom, equality are non-negotiable and a one way street, as well as playing catch-up with the West. Still, every day media and forums go crazy about yet another political threat to democracy and human rights; every day we are confronted with other bubbles - mainstream and generalised - of hyper conservative values (i.e. \u201cfilthy Roma people do not deserve housing\u201d). \nThe surprise for me was when sometimes, these statements came from places I least expected, friends of friends who let it slip that their true opinions are the opposite of inclusive progress and a shared future. It is shocking because in Romania we've been used to politicians swinging it since forever (we called it \"politicianism\"), but new flavours in the past ten years or so are going left and right. Populism captures many souls looking for quick solutions and intellectual shortcuts. When people you know who are the new generation become conservative, you realise that politics is down in your house now. So I felt that my living was contrived: I was friends with people whom maybe today I would not choose.\n\nOn the positive side, I rejoiced having escaped conservatism due to good upbringing. (self-)Discipline and progressive family values (thanks mom and dad!) make one want to open horizons and look beyond the scarce value offer nationally: unfortunately it often entails getting out.\n\nGetting out is generalized and massive: in the early nineties people were flooding out for the \u201cwestern mirage\u201d in search of better lives. 3.4 millions left in just the last 10 years, and currently around 5 million live abroad, from a population of 22 million. That's a lot. 400 000 live only in the UK and are now facing risks of being pushed away by politics gone wrong.\n\nI didn't leave out of cynicism or lack of hope, to be honest. Still, I can't help but wonder: the way out is sometimes mentally healthier than staying. The fight remains though, but you do it from a \"sunnier\" place. Uhm, yes, Brussels.", "created_at": "2019-01-18 10:30:31.124730", "updated_at": "2020-12-15 12:06:51.229015", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 579, "wiki": false, "reads": 58, "score": 533.6, "like_count": 12, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3904, 4, 5, 3067, 1856, 2636, 3703, 5201, 2201, 4892, 6164, 428], "is_private": false}, {"id": 52070, "user_id": 4993, "topic_id": 9584, "post_number": 80, "raw": "I'm ready, willing and able to be a community manager for even longer than your three years. \nHere's my LinkedIn profile:\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/madhukopparam/", "created_at": "2019-03-26 12:28:44.541294", "updated_at": "2019-03-26 12:28:44.541294", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 29, "wiki": false, "reads": 23, "score": 9.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 88987, "user_id": 4022, "topic_id": 15104, "post_number": 2, "raw": "It's certainly possible, but it's not necessarily trivial.

I'm a freelancer in the social media world who has worked for tech giants such as Microsoft Europe and ad-tech organizations such as IAB Europe.\n\nEver since I was a kid, I enjoyed participating in conversations groups about various topics. When I was a kid, I got passionate about history (medieval to be more precise, and this is a passion that I have to this day), and later about that new thing that will change the world: WWW.\n\nBeing an 80s kid, I've seen the rise of the Internet, PCs, the dot.com boom, and the rise of smartphones and AI.\n\nDuring my high school years, and throughout my University (I've studied business IT), I've had the pleasure to take part in various discussion groups on what the technology is doing to us as a society, and how can we as humans make technology to work and empower us, not to strain us and make us it's slaves. Later in university, as broadband became more accessible, I've started to use social media more. I've joined Facebook back in 2007 and used it without stop since then.\n\nThe experience I've gained by using it (from managing first Facebook groups, to pages to advertising), I've managed to transfer into my first working experience abroad, at Microsoft Europe (office in Brussels). At Microsoft Europe, I managed a large community of people who are into technology and into the Internet as a whole. There I was responsible for community management, particularly to drive conversations on how technology and the WWW can be used to boost productivity and make a difference for SMEs.\n\nOther relevant experience is my current involvement with IAB Europe, an ad-tech trade body who's behind IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework, pushing GDPR & ePrivacy preparedness. At IAB Europe, I'm the sole responsible for its social media presence, and in helping in creating some of the strategies to ensure that the web isn't over-regulated, and so it still stays free, supports innovation and gives the ability to anyone with a dream to achieve it online. \n\nMy personal views are that the web needs to transform, that it needs to stay always open, innovative, respect privacy and enable anyone to search, write and create whatever they are set to do. Only with such an internet, society as a whole can progress\n\nMy skills include:\nCommunity management (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, forums, message boards)\nSocial media analytics  (Brandwatch)\nContent discovery (Buzzsumo)\n# analytics and tracking\nUsage of social media dashboards: SproutSocial, Buffer, Hootsuite\nI speak Croatia, English, Dutch, some German and basic Russian.\n\nI live in Brussels, Belgium, and I come from Croatia.\nMy most up to date CV: [LinkedinCV](http://be.linkedin.com/in/simonovskifilip)", "created_at": "2019-03-22 14:29:14.649760", "updated_at": "2019-03-22 14:29:14.649760", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 472, "wiki": false, "reads": 27, "score": 30.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4970], "is_private": false}, {"id": 88981, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 15106, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Please use this thread to pull interesting/rich quotes from the NGI platform.

We are focused on understanding people's own perspectives on the Internet and desired futures for it to inform long term strategies and policies. We intend to convene a large online conversation in which people discuss these issues, performing continuous ethnographic analysis on it. \n\nWe are looking to hire two or more ethnographers to collaborate with us on this project. This would run for about two and a half to three years on a part-time basis (approximately 20% of your time). We think it would suit graduate students well, who might re-use the work for a thesis or papers (everything is open access), but we will consider any applicant. We have a total budget of about 57,600 Euro (the equivalent of one full time person). Depending on candidates, time commitment, and language capability, we can split this between 2-4 people.\n\n### Requirements:\n\n* Trained in the theory and practice of ethnography.\n* Comfortable performing online ethnography.\n* Experience with qualitative data analysis, specifically qualitative coding. The software is unimportant as we have our own, which you will be trained to use.\n* Ability to collaborate with other ethnographers coding the same dataset in different languages.\n* Flexibility and willingness to engage in productive dialogue around coding decisions\u2014 good communication skills are a must.\n* Strong organization skills -- must be available for weekly check-ins and document coding choices in a shared open codebook. \n* Good knowledge of English as well as fluency in one or more of the following languages: French, German, Italian, Polish.\n\n### Tasks\n\n* Code the conversations, using a tool we built in-house called Open Ethnographer.\n* Build an ontology of relevant codes, appropriate to ethnographic coding of the online conversation, and keep a detailed and organized codebook.\n* Collaborate with other ethnographers to maintain a consistent multi-language coding ontology.\n* Help to compile an ethnographic report at the conclusion of the project.\n* Participate in the discussion towards improving both Open Ethnographer and the SSNA methodology.\n\nThe kind of qualitative coding we do has an added element to it: we use the codes to build a social semantic network, mixing ethnography and network science to produce a visualisation of the convened conversation. Thanks to the ethnography, the network visualisation shows not only who is talking to each other (the social network), but also what they are talking about (the semantic network, built from ethnographic codes). This method of inquiry preserves the richness of conversation but provides a higher-level view and allows for some quantitative analyses. With social semantic network analysis (SSNA), we can identify networks of codes, and measure their cohesiveness; identify emergent networks of specialists, who interact around specific keywords; and validate individual contributors, among other applications (to learn more, [see here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/semantic-social-network-analysis-the-video/7939)).\n\nAs part of the role, you can also use the ethnographic/SSNA data to produce publications. In fact, we would encourage you to.\n\n### Workplace\n\nYou can do the work online, from wherever you are, but you will be requested to participate in one or more physical meetings. Your travel expenses for these meetings will be covered.\nIf you happen to be in Brussels or Stockholm, you can also come work at the Reef or Blivande (our workspaces), but that\u2019s not a requisite. We coordinate and communicate through the Edgeryders platform.\n\n\n### How to apply \n\nWrite to amelia@edgeryders.eu. Include:\n\n* A short motivation letter, explaining why you want to do this and why you think you can deliver.\n* A CV.\n\nApplications will be reviewed as they are received until openings are filled.", "created_at": "2019-03-15 19:05:30.009494", "updated_at": "2019-04-08 09:11:36.016198", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 659, "wiki": false, "reads": 30, "score": 3298.0, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 4022, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 51943, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 9621, "post_number": 3, "raw": "", "created_at": "2019-03-21 14:33:54.835772", "updated_at": "2019-03-21 14:33:54.835772", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 51779, "user_id": 2569, "topic_id": 9623, "post_number": 6, "raw": "Naming things is just the worst.

Also, information-technical staff is superscarce: its basically me (a common issue in ecovillages and intentional communities, too).\n\n\n**2 The Use Case / Customer**\n\nHowever, we run several businesses and associations and of course their work would not be possible \u2013 or at least really really cumbersome \u2013 without the use of tools, like for bookkeeping, communication, general management and so on.\n\nAs we see our mission also to provide experience spaces and education in various areas to visitors, a rather big business of ours is our workshop venue, where we host and cater guests that take part in (usually) multi-day workshops and seminars. We have approximately 7000 night-stays per year.\n\nWe will build a new house to serve the needs of that business (new sleeping rooms, new office, etc. pp.) and want to use new tooling once it is finished (2020). To decide which path to go, we formed a group that evaluates existing solutions and alternatives (i.e. a build-your-own Free Software). The software should integrate with book-keeping, allow management of teams that are responsible for the accommodation rooms, the workshop rooms, the kitchen, the registration of visitors, etc. pp. Of yourse online-registration of visitors is a must (but not necessarily payment).

Kind of. We rely heavily on in-house/intranet services; we even had a local mail-server (with forwarding). For the seminar software: it used to use replicated databases (thats a feature **really done right** in couchdb), such that the seminars on the webpage and registrations are synched in both directions. Nowadays, I just \"pull\" the registrations that are stored on the (public) webserver from our local server and \"push\" changed or newly created seminars from our local server to the (public) webserver. That part of the system is open sourced actually.\n\n[quote=\"hugi, post:3, topic:9645\"]\nIs there any particular reason for your preference of RoR?\n[/quote]\n\nYes, but it is difficult to make a good argument here in this thread without sounding like I know things better or making other solution \"smaller\".\n\nSo, I am definately not the god to do objective statements, but *in my observation*\n  * RoR and its ecosystem provide pretty stable, mature and cleanly implemented solutions (I had the impression that with JavaScript you have to learn a new framework tomorrow, and migrations are not always smooth - but things are probably getting better)\n  * Rubys community in general appears to be quite open and inclusive with programs like [Rails](https://guides.railsgirls.com/) [Girls](http://railsgirls.com/) and [Ruby Together](https://rubytogether.org/), [RubyMe](https://rubyme.org/), transgender and disabled programmers at conferences etc.\n  * Also, the community welcomes discussions about code cleanliness, guiding principles (like TDD, soa, ...), code of conducts, values and ethics ([minaswan](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/MINASWAN) and stuff)\n  * its a lot of fun for me and others (pretty important point), and the tooling is pretty much what I expect from a web framework\n  * I am really oldschool and like webpages that consume CPU of the server and not so much of the client (i.e. few client-side javascript)\n\n\nSo it boils down to: I am a really oldschool, grumpy guy that likes to read books, think about principles and prefers quality over speed and shinyness. But don't make it an argument because I have hardly touched modern JS environments and I would never start a religious war over technology (except over vim vs emacs, maybe ;) ).

Introduction](#heading--1)**\n\n**[2. Setup](#heading--2)**\n\n**[3. Writing the invoice](#heading--3)**\n\n**[4. Accounting for the invoice](#heading--4)**\n\n------\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--1\">1. Introduction</h2>\n\nThis process is about issuing invoices by Edgeryders O\u00dc to its clients. If you want to send an invoice _to_ Edgeryders O\u00dc to be paid by us, go here instead: [Invoice payment process](/t/7394).\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2. Setup</h2>\n\nFor the purposes of this manual, an **invoice** is a document that accounts for revenue received by Edgeryders, *against the provision of goods and services* (in our case it will always be services). There are two cases:\n\n1. A _client_ has purchased goods or services from Edgeryders. Example: a European capital of culture buys training for their community managers.\n\n2. A  _funder_ issues a grant to a project that Edgeryders delivers. Example: the European Commission pays for research projects. \n\nIn both cases we issue similar documents, using the `Invoice` tab of FreeAgent. In accounting terms, however, they are different: Case 1 requires proper invoices, and the associated revenue falls under `Sales`. Case 2 produces documents we will call \"pseudo-invoices\", and the associated revenue falls under `Grant income`. Please be clear about which case you are dealing with before you start. \n\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--3\">3. Writing the invoice</h2>\n\n### Issuing an invoice against a sale\n\n1. **Get the client's VAT number.** This is very important.\n\n2. Open FreeAgent, then choose `Work => Invoicing => Add new invoice`. \n\n3. Fill the form. Don't forget to assign the invoice to a project. If this is the first invoice for a brand new project you might have to create one (`Work => projects`). Click on `Create invoice`. If the client is not already recorded in FreeAgent, it will not show up in the drop-down menu under `Contact`. In that case, choose `Contacts => Add new contact` and fill the information, including the VAT number. Under `Charge VAT` choose `Always`.\n\n4. In the second screen create invoicing items, and make sure that the VAT rate (which relates to _Estonian_ VAT) is chosen appropriately. The appropriate VAT rate is:\n\n    * 0% in almost all cases, with the exceptions listed below.\n    * 20% if the client is **incorporated in Estonia**.\n    * 20% if the client has **no VAT number**.\n\n5. For the special case where the client is not a VAT-registered business or institutional customer, also check if their country of residence levies [VAT on e-services on non-resident providers selling to consumers](https://www.avalara.com/vatlive/en/global-vat-gst-on-e-services.html). If so, you have to somehow include that into the invoice and forward it to the government of that country.\n\n6. Click `Save`, then `Mark as sent`. This tells FreeAgent that your invoice is no longer a draft, and should go into Profit and loss. At this point you can download the invoice and send it to the client. \n\n\n### Issuing a pseudo-invoice against a grant \n\nThe procedure is the same as above. VAT does not apply to grants, and grant makers normally have their own language to justify it (EU treaties, UN treaties etc.). Grant makers typically do not ask for our pseudo invoices: we generate them for our own internal accounting.\n\nThis also means that, if you are dealing with a new grant maker and are creating their contact information, you should set the `Charge VAT` field to `Never`.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--4\">4. Accounting for the invoice</h2>\n\n\"Proper\" invoices against a sale do not require any additional accounting moves. Pseudo-invoices against grants do.

For? Children?_\n_How do you think the care in your country looks like? How do you look after others?_\n\nCare is a key element of a healthy society. Its quality and availability translate into quality of life - this applies to both health, psychological and social care. Our opportunities to participate in family and public life, access to work, depend on whether in our cities we have doctors and clinics, hospitals and kindergartens, people helping the elderly and disabled in everyday activities, support for poor families or homeless. Meanwhile, health care is limping - queues to specialist doctors, which are inadequate in Poland, last even a year. We spend more than half on the health of the budget for less than half, for example, Germany - and many people can not afford a good doctor or care far from home. Not to mention the chronic shortage of doctors.\n\nMore and more often we notice people demand the necessary changes - which ones do you personally feel are the most urgent?\n\nLittle more is spent on combating homelessness and building social housing. Stories of families and older people being thrown out of privatized houses appear regularly in national media - many of them are offered instead of premises with conditions unworthy of the developed country.\n\nUnder-funded are also pensions, pensions, health care and rehabilitation. For example, the protest of families of disabled people in Poland in the last year showed us the scale of the problem - not only do disabled people not get enough support from the state, insufficient help for their families means that many of them live in poverty and can not work. Many of us support the right to the birth of every child - but few of us are aware of the costs and hardships of providing a decent standard of living for people with disabilities. This is even more paradoxical in the country with the strictest rules in Europe when it comes to the right to abortion.\n\n**Under-funding assistance for older people dumps this obligation on younger generations.** Often, they are often lonely, infirm, living alone and living with insufficient pensions. Half of poverty, if they have families, and these families can afford it. Worse with those who live alone, or their relatives, barely connect the end to the end. Additional burdens make it difficult for such families to get out of poverty or to educate their children. Perhaps you know the problem from your own experience, and have ideas that would help you cope with this challenge?\n\nYoung families are directly affected by an insufficient number of kindergartens and cr\u00e8ches - that's why parents do not send their children to them as often as in other European countries. And this affects their professional and financial situation, not to mention educational opportunities for children.\n\nIn addition, money is often spent in an ineffective way, which reduces the chances of poor people to change their life situation. Sweden, Hungary and Luxembourg are much better off here, whose social assistance is three times more likely to help citizens get out of poverty. Do you think that the role of the state is responsible and wise financial management, and help the poor to improve their situation?\n\nWe are curious about your opinion on social and health care in (country). First of all, should it be exercised by the state - and if so, what, in your opinion, would have to be included in it? Do you need solidarity with the poor and the excluded? If so, why?\n\n# We have created a special forum for this need, where we can safely talk about important topics. \nWe will avoid conflicts and insults here, we will provide all participants with the right conditions to express their own opinions and feelings.\n\nThanks to you, we will understand what are the life experiences of anyone who has something to say about it.\n\nThose who are especially active in the conversation are eligible to get a 200 \u20ac reward for their contributions if they are based in Europe.

These are 470 mostly German forums with together 19.5 million members which came together to advocate against article 13.\n\nUnfortunately, it did not help so far. Likewise, the petition with 5.5 million signatures did not help anything. And the demonstrations did not help anything. The majority of politicians are an Internet-agnostic gerontocracy that keeps ignoring us.\n\nAnd honestly, I don't think that any plan has a chance of success in the last ten days before the Council vote (which is typically just a formality). Did any European law so far fail at that step? I hardly ever discourage anyone from doing what they see suitable, but here I'd like to propose a different plan:\n\n1. Of course, let's vote in the European elections for candidates that want to reverse this copyright \"reform\", and not vote for anyone who endorsed it. Voting is, after all, the recurring opportunity for a non-violent revolution, embedded in the democratic system. Or, it should be.\n\n2. It's time for dismantling the system thoroughly and completely by civil disobedience against the copyright reform. As far as I am concerned, the EU's law-making process lost all moral authority with a blatantly anti-democratic vote like that for the the copyright \"reform\".\n\n   So a campaign for forums and platforms to ignore article 13 and to implement technical and legal countermeasures that allow doing so might be more useful at this point, as building citizen-controlled darknet infrastructure is a good tool against further state interventionism in the Internet, anyway. There are a lot of options, including so-called bulletproof hosting in countries suitable for offering it. We could start with mapping out ideas and options, and then to  a crowdfunding campaign to create a toolkit that allows forums to safely ignore the article 13 nonsense.", "created_at": "2019-03-30 01:15:07.027540", "updated_at": "2019-03-30 01:15:07.027540", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 377, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 11.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [52164], "is_reply_to": [52164], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 52177, "user_id": 5000, "topic_id": 9676, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Hello matthias,\nFirst of all, thank you for taking the time to read my text and reply.\n\nThank you also for the link to the Uploadfilter platform in Germany. It's good to see that my points are exactly the points that those forums identified. I'm glad to see that in Germany people are so much conscient and prepared for what is coming. In Portugal, the issue was played down a lot, mostly with the attitude \"someone will work things out\".\n\nThat Open Letter from the forums (I've just read the english version) was very good. So was the petition (I also signed and donated) and the demonstrations.\nBUT, looking back now, I feel that one thing wasn't done too well: taking the issue to the personal sphere of relationships of politicians. \n\nNot address them with general actions or contact them as anonymous people that they have never heard before. The key may be (it's my hope) to make influential people to talk to the elected politicians at the governments, because a politician will more easily hear what a friend/acquaintance has to say (unfortunately that's how it works many times... many politicians are deaf to the people outside their bubble).\n\nOf course we must use our votes well. BUT... also for that to happen, it will be important for us to create right now a network of people in several countries, that will call for politicians to declare their stance and to encourage people to vote for those that want to reverse. Also, the forums will be important to spread the word (forums are much better for that, than social networks where people don't read much and where the posts reach is small, except for big pages).\nBuilding this network to work for the Elections takes time and **is not** incompatible with starting with a protest plan right now to pressure the governments. On the contrary, we should start right now.\n\nRegarding civil disobedience I believe is not so easy. Here are some points:\n- if the forum is in the EU (or it's owner is in the EU) it is liable. So, not working according to the law, may result in serious legal trouble.\n- creating forums in the darknet or underground internet, may work for a while (until the authorities get there) and that would only serve the small percentage of people who would know how to install and configure software to use those darknet forums\n- hosting in other countries is not a viable option, because if the users or the forum owner are in Europe, they are still liable for legal action. Example: Youtube may escape this regulation if they shutdown video uploads from Europe (in that case, Europeans will only be able to view videos from other countries). They cannot allow european people to upload new videos without a filter (and that filter will also have to cover text, it's a new thing from this Directive).\n\nI believe my plan is realistic. But in case you want an \"easy\" action to defend forums, I will give you one suggestion: every 35 months, a forum can buy a new domain and transfer the userbase (with previous users agreement) to the new domain, in fact creating a new legal entity. Therefore, switching every 2.9 years, small forums will be able to escape the terrible upload filter. It's doable? Sure. But it's a lot, lot of trouble (and some users will be lost in the process).", "created_at": "2019-03-30 21:10:26.630749", "updated_at": "2019-03-30 21:10:26.630749", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 587, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 56.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [52167], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 52180, "user_id": 3704, "topic_id": 9676, "post_number": 4, "raw": "most cool, that 'iceberg of ignorance' - it's one we want to melt!

Very few listened and probably even fewer acted on it.\nMost people just said: \"no, there won't be any catastrophe, things will work out in the end\". Typical... let someone else care about it.\n\nI'm Jorge, a portuguese citizen, and I work in internet projects since the late 90's. I grew up enjoying a free internet and appreciating the freedom principles of this new digital era, and I do not wish to see ours and the next generations becoming trapped in a censorship machine.\nYes, there are things to perfect, to further defend copyright holders, but not at the strong expense of freedom of speech and freedom of operation.\n\nSo, straight to the point: I know it's hugely disappointing to see the European Parliament approving this directive, **but there is still a minor chance to change things and we have to fight for it. I cannot stand still watching this, it is too important for our society!**\nIf Europe is not a beacon of freedom, what have we become? If this is the way Europe wants to behave towards Internet, how can we blame brexiters for wanting to leave \"this\" Europe? We have to fix this.\n\nI know the big platforms like Google, Facebook and others will be able to cope with the directive (with filters, money thrown at lawyers, etc) and **now I'm mostly worried about the small platforms where people participate in forums, blogs, etc. That is where freedom right now is most in peril!**\n\nI have been reading about Julia's efforts for some months and yesterday I was browsing over the Saveyourinternet Twitter account and I saw that they retweeted a tweet about fighting the Directive and that mentioned EdgeRyders..\nI came to visit this forum and from what I've seen, there seem to be some community managers who could be truly important in the next steps of this fight.\nSo that's why I'm here. :slight_smile: \n\nTime is of essence and we must change the way we have been fighting. Let's now go directly to the \"big guys\", the top politicians. Let's get them take the heat/info from influential people around them (see below). I hope that will make them hear better what we have to say about the dangers and unfairness of this Directive.\n.\n.\n\nFirst question: does anyone know for sure when is the Directive going to be approved by the Governments? Is it in the Council of 9th May? **If so, we still have time!**\nCan you confirm that date? I found it here:\nhttps://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/calendar/?dateFrom=2019%2F03%2F27&dateTo=2020%2F03%2F28&filters=2031 \n**Update: because the Brexit Deal wasn't approved at the UK parliament, an extraordinary European Council was called for the 10th April. That gives us much less time, but it still doable if we get to work!**\n\n.\n.\n.\n\n**My proposed plan to fight old Article 13 (now Article 17):**\n- For each european Country, **identify 50 important forums/blogs/services** with user generated content that are mostly small/amateurs, but well known, popular, with a strong public voice (not too underground) and are over 3 years old\n- **Contact them. Show them first the devastating effects. Ask them if they agree** with the Copyright Directive, articles 13 and 11 and if they are confident about staying on business after the new directive?  What do they plan to do once the corresponding new law is created?\n    1 - acquire or develop upload filters software? (note: Youtube spent 100 millions building their upload filter)\n    2 - change to a human approval system for posts/comments?\n    3 - acquire licences from every and each copyright holder in the world and operate as usual? Assuming co-responsibility on user content posted, risking being sued and going to court?\n\n- **Identify also 20 important sites/foruns/services with user generated content that are big** (>10M annual revenue)\n- **Contact them. Show them first the devastating effects.** Ask them if they agree with the Copyright Directive, articles 13 and 11 and if they are confident about staying on business after the new directive that demands upload filters and co-responsibility on user content. What do they plan to do once the corresponding new law is created?\n    1 - acquire or develop upload filters software? (note: Youtube spent 100 millions building their upload filter)\n    2 - change to a human approval system for posts/comments?\n    3 - acquire licences from every and each copyright holder in the world and operate as usual? Assuming co-responsibility on user content posted, risking being sued and going to court?\n\n- For those that show signs of opposition and disconfort:\n    - **ask them to put up warnings to their users** that the new directive may put them out of business or severely affect them\n    - **ask them and their users to contact/email the government** to ask for an urgent intervention to revert the bad aspects of the directive!\n    - **follow-up frequently** to see if they got any response from the government\n\n- **Copy and repeat for several european countries**\n\n.\n.\nNote 1: Upload filter cost: https://venturebeat.com/2018/11/07/youtube-weve-invested-100-million-in-content-id-and-paid-over-3-billion-to-rightsholders/ \n.\n.\nNote 2: Youtube may also be happy to sell subscriptions to upload filters, cost unknown...\nhttps://www.wired.co.uk/article/article-13-youtube-what-next \n.\n.\nNote 3: Upload filters are not foolproof. If posts/comments with copyrighted content happen to appear in your service, your service may still be sued (not only the user that was responsible for it)\nhttps://www.techdirt.com/articles/20181214/17272041233/youtubes-100-million-upload-filter-failures-demonstrate-what-disaster-article-13-will-be-internet.shtml \n.\n.\n**END OF PLAN**\n.\n.\n.\n**Expected Results:** governments should start receiving contacts from influent people who own and/or participate in these forums/blogs. \n\nThat should be a big help for our cause: governments receiving feedback from entrepreneurs / \"VIP\" people, from people that are known in society (and not only \"young youtubers\"), journalists, people that really use these services and are afraid of loosing them! **And specially people that KNOW politicians and people that can get ACCESS to politicians**.\n.\n.\nUnfortunately, we must admit that these VIP \"influencers\" usually have more influence over governments than anonymous users... \nHuman nature works like this:\n- if they come for others... people let it go (politicians that don't use many forums or blogs are the first to vote happily for the Directive)\n- if they come for us or for our friends... we will listen! (**politicians will listen more carefully if their friends, people they trust, warn them of what is going to happen**)\n\n.\n.\nSo let's get the fight to the inner circle of the governments, lets get influent people, friends of politicians, to take the role of bringing the message to governments, to make them see this is a big mistake.\nThe demonstrations on the street and anonymous users actions (emails, contacts) have not worked as desired, so we must try another route...\n\n**Let's go big, let's go directly to the VIP people that have a voice in digital media and have a connection to the center of decision: the government. Let's make the governments see how people can get hurt for real, their friends, their fellow entrepreneurs, their influential VOTERS!**\n\nThere are many influential persons running blogs and forums (cooking, automobile, marketing, finance, etc). We really have to go after the \"popular\" and well-connected blogs and forums (not the underground ones, because those will not have easy access to politicians).\n\n**We have to show them the effects of this Directive, they will be scared for sure. So they will ACT now, because the Directive is already approved (they thought it was too extreme? well, now it's real).**\n.\n.\n.\nLast note: do you know about the Iceberg of Ignorance?\nBasically, what I'm saying is:\n- politicians are at the top and the message of protests doesn't reach them efficiently (noise / obstacles / disinterest)\n- so, we must take a shortcut and take the message to the \"Team Managers\" (forum operators and bloggers), hoping they are people or they know people that have access to politicians. So they can pass along to the politicians the message about the wrong things in this Directive!\n![image|690x327](upload://jvqVqqcg5TnPRCZrmPDjOlgxvbo.jpeg) \n\n.\n.\nI can get this to work in my country, I know some people with good connections, I know journalists, I can reach to youtubers too, use social networks, user personal contacts, etc.\nAnd I'm sure that people in other countries can do the same. You can probably identify easily a small group of people for each country that are energetic and willing to use the same plan.\n.\n.\nDoes this proposal make sense to you? What do you think would make it better, more effective and more pragmatic to reach the hearts of people **with influence around the governments**?\n.\nWhich countries are the most interesting \"targets\" and could overturn the vote in the European Council? We should start with the strongest of those, of course.\n\n**Let's do this??**\n\n*********************************************************\n\nWhat similar approach could we take about old Article 11?\nI know it's about the link tax but I've not been focusing so much about it (other than Google News could stop existing and that curated blogs would get hurt also). I also know that similar initiatives failed in Spain and Germany.\nBut what is key here is: what specific and down-to-earth reasons could we use to contact and convince influent people (bloggers, others) about the negative impact of old Article 11?\n\n\n*********************************************************", "created_at": "2019-03-29 23:41:13.766020", "updated_at": "2019-03-30 00:03:01.906374", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1632, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 157.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 52357, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 9679, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Way to go, @matthias!

Administration), in dem es aber auch Funktionen zur Verbindung der einzelnen Communities gibt. Unter anderem wird ein Account zum Login in allen Foren verwendet, @Mentions sind \u00fcber Foren-Grenzen hinweg m\u00f6glich, und Beitreten zu und Umschalten zwischen einzelnen Foren-Communities ist komfortabel m\u00f6glich.\n\n\n#### Welches gesellschaftliche Problem willst Du mit dem Projekt l\u00f6sen?\n\nDurch die gro\u00dfen Social Media Plattformen (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) hat sich der Dialog im Internet gewandelt. Die Plattformen sind komfortabel f\u00fcr Endbenutzer, und die im Vergleich weniger komfortablen Internet-Foren werden deshalb gemieden. Durch die Konzentration des Internet-Dialogs in kommerziell kontrollierten Foren ergaben sich aber gewichtige Nachteile, die f\u00fcr Communities der gesellschaftlichen Erneuerung nicht akzeptabel sind. So wird die Reichweite von Posts durch die Social Media Plattform mit undurchsichtigen Kriterien kontrolliert. Und die Knzentration auf kurze unterhaltsame Inhalte hat die Diskussionskultur verflacht und polarisiert.\n\n\n#### Wie willst Du Dein Projekt technisch umsetzen?\n\nUnser aktueller Ansatz ist eine Erweiterung von Discourse, der aktuell \"modernsten\" Open Source Foren-Software (siehe https://discourse.org/ ). Jede Foren-Community erh\u00e4lt eine komplette Discourse-Installation, inkl. Admin-Rechten. Wir verwenden bereits den Single-Sign-On Mechanismus in Discourse so dass Benutzer sich mit einem Account in allen Foren-Communities anmelden k\u00f6nnen, ohne erneute Eingabe des Passworts.\n\nDie geplanten Erweiterungen zur Komplettierung dieser Infrastruktur sind folgende:\n\n1. @Mentions zwischen Foren-Communities. Benutzernamen sind bereits eindeutig im gesamten Netzwerk, aber aktuell ist es nur m\u00f6glich diejenigen Mitglieder mit einer @Mention Erw\u00e4hnung zu benachrichtigen, die bereits dem eigenen Forum beigetreten sind. Hier planen wir ein Plugin f\u00fcr Discourse, das auch Benutzernamen aus allen anderen Foren-Communities vorschl\u00e4gt.\n\n2. Besserer Ablauf bei Signup und Login. Bedingt durch den SSO-Mechanismus ist der Ablauf aktuell nicht benutzerfreundlich genug. Wir m\u00fcssen einige \u00c4nderungen in Discourse vornehmen und werden diese upstream beitragen.\n\n3. Direkte Nachrichten zwischen Mitgliedern unterschiedlicher Foren-Communities.\n\n4. Benachrichtigungen im Forum-Umschaltmen\u00fc erreichbar machen.\n\n5. Eingebettete Bewerbung von relevanten Inhalten anderer Foren.\n\n6. Software-Paketierung zur Vereinfachung der aktuell komplexen Installation.\n\n\n#### Welche \u00e4hnlichen L\u00f6sungen gibt es schon, und was wird dein Projekt anders bzw. besser machen?\n\nEs gibt:\n\n1. Reddit, aber es ist nicht Open Source Infrastruktur.\n\n2. Stack Exchange (https://stackexchange.com/), aber es ist nicht Open Source Infrastruktur und hat ein Q&A statt Forum-Format.\n\nWir bauen eine Open Source L\u00f6sung, die so jeder f\u00fcr gesellschaftliche Ver\u00e4nderung engagierter Community ohne kommerzielle Kontrolle zur Verf\u00fcgung steht.\n\n\n#### Wer ist die Zielgruppe, und wie soll Dein Tool sie erreichen?\n\nUnsere Zielgruppe sind Communities, die sich f\u00fcr gesellschaftliche Ver\u00e4nderung (insbesondere gegen Klimawandel und Umweltzerst\u00f6rung) einsetzen und deshalb ein Werkzeug suchen um intern effizient zu arbeiten und sich effizient mit anderen relevanten Communities zu vernetzen.\n\nWir werden das Tool zum Download und Selbst-Hosting und als SaaS Hosting-Dienstleistung unserer Zielgruppe anbieten. In beiden F\u00e4llen (kostenloses Selbst-Hosting oder komfortables Hosting bei uns) kann eine Forum-Community dem Foren-Netzwerk beitreten und den vollen Funktionsumfang nutzen.\n\n\n#### Hast Du schon an der Idee gearbeitet? Wenn ja, beschreibe kurz den aktuellen Stand und erkl\u00e4re die Neuerung.\n\nUnser aktueller Stand ist ein funktionierendes Netzwerk mehrerer Discourse-Foren, die mit einem Account erreichbar sind und zwischen denen der Benutzer komfortabel \u00fcber ein Men\u00fc oben rechts auf jeder Website wechseln kann. Diese Software ist unter [edgeryders.eu](https://edgeryders.eu/) im Live-Betrieb und [hier](/t/7419) dokumentiert.\n\nDie Liste der von uns geplanten Features zur Komplettierung befindet sich oben unter \"Wie willst Du Dein Projekt technisch umsetzen?\".\n\n\n#### Link zum bestehenden Projekt (falls vorhanden):\n\n[https://edgeryders.eu/t/7419](/t/7419)\n\n\n#### Skizziere kurz die wichtigsten Meilensteine, die Du (bzw. das Team) im F\u00f6rderzeitraum umsetzen willst.\n\n1. Anforderungsanalyse und Co-Design in Zusammenarbeit mit unserer eigenen Foren-Community, die eine erste Version der geplanten Software bereits im Live-Betrieb nutzt und Erfahrungen damit sammeln konnte.\n\n2. Umsetzung der geplanten Features in Ruby und JavaScript. Inkl. Pull-Requests upstream zum Projekt Discourse, wo \u00c4nderungen an der Kern-Software notwendig werden (d.h. wo Funktionen nicht in Plugins implementiert werden k\u00f6nnen).\n\n3.

Let's see how I move past my awe this time.\nPerhaps you'll appreciate my humble, initial contribution \"[Meditation on group communication](https://medium.com/@unclecj/meditation-on-group-communication-2715520e3a7e)\"", "created_at": "2019-05-08 13:10:30.968918", "updated_at": "2019-05-08 15:17:43.064219", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 154, "wiki": false, "reads": 23, "score": 109.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [53163], "is_liked_by": [4, 4022], "is_private": false}, {"id": 53239, "user_id": 5083, "topic_id": 9705, "post_number": 68, "raw": "[quote=\"alberto, post:67, topic:9705\"]\nWell recognized, @unclecj.

In network terms, your groups are perfect cliques, with everybody connected to everybody else by edges of equal weight representing communications.

Groups can scale much better if you allow for more flexibility in patterns of connectivity (local hubs, lattices, small world etc.).\n[/quote]\n\nPrecisely the question I hope you might elaborate on! Indeed I could rename my article \"meditation on meetings\", I was mainly thinking of the communication happening around a single table. My intention was to establish a base case, driven by my personal hypersensitivity to quality of conversation and inspired by the [late Ladislaus Horatius' \"Mindfulosophy\"](https://www.facebook.com/Visdomsgille-Mindfulosophy-1216582355070855/).\nI touch on topology in _\"Dividing into smaller group can enable more participation and diverse conversations, but unless you can summarize and bring those thoughts back you lose out on the benefits of a large group of participants to begin with\"_ and have seen (painfully) failed attempts to migrate existing large groups to sensible topologies... but yes, I very much look forward to your elaboration.", "created_at": "2019-05-08 14:50:42.969844", "updated_at": "2019-05-08 14:50:42.969844", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 253, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 9.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [53234], "is_reply_to": [53234], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 53313, "user_id": 5050, "topic_id": 9705, "post_number": 76, "raw": "Hey, I will gladly attend.

We have decided to convene a small meeting dedicated to pushing the edge of our digital ethnographic methods in the context of POPREBEL. \n\n## Why we are doing this\n\nSSNA is a (very) mixed method. I have a hunch that it could benefit a lot from some methodological steroids. I'm bringing in Sander as someone with plenty of experience in deploying clever methodological combos that draw on different disciplines. Skunkworks 1 is meant as a sort of steroids for the POPREBEL methodology. We also envision a Skunkworks 2, which will deal more with actual early research results and will probably happen in 2020. \n\n## What will happen\n\nWe are thinking three sessions. Each is started by a presentation, followed by a long, deep, free flow discussion. Think 3 to 4 hours per session.\n\n* **Session 1. SSNA: the state of the art** (presentation by @amelia and myself). We discuss SSNA, the main weapon EDGE is deploying onto POPREBEL, and try to get to a fully shared understanding of the implications of working this way.\n* **Session 2. Understanding populism with digital ethnography** (presentation by @jan). We look at what POPREBEL thinks populism is, and look at the implications of studying it with the tools we use. \n* **Session 3. Populism in a complex systems perspective** (presentation by @sander). To what extent can we bring to bear the experience of complex systems scientists onto POPREBEL? What can we learn from that experience? Can SSNA be improved to function as a complex systems method? \n\n\n## Where, when and who\n\n**Note: updated dates**. The first digital ethnography  skunkworks takes place in Brussels, on Tuesday, 16th and Wednesday, 17th of July 2019. The following people please save the date:\n\n1. @jan\n1. @Richard \n1. @amelia\n1. @hugi\n1. @noemi\n1. @melancon \n\nIf you really really cannot make the dates, flag it now, we still have some flexibility but need to set the date in stone soon. \n\nWe can and should expand the group a bit, but not by much.

If we have shown fantastic technological and intellectual capacity, on the other hand, we can be seen as the same old morons when it comes to organizing ourselves into a civilized society.\u201d\n    * Krzysztof Pomian: \u201cDemocratic politics does not exploit the friend/foe dichotomy. Its culmination is not war and its aim is not defeat and annihilation of the enemy. Democratic politics operates with a three-way division: the followers/the hesitant/the opponents. Its purpose is convincing the hesitant and gaining a majority. The friend/foe dichotomy appears only when democracy is threatened and a state of emergency has to be declared. Nevertheless, a state of emergency does not reveal a democracy\u2019s true nature, but it does reveal that of a totalitarian form of government, which is essentially a state of emergency regime.\u201d\n\n* Globalization: four dimensions and their problems/challenges:\n    * **Economic:**\n      * Extraction of energy from the environment without barriers (profit motif: coal/oil curse)\n      * Unconstrained trade: disrupted communities\n    * **Political:** coordinating collective existence: what scale is optimal (local, national, global)?\n    * **Social:** population movements: how to organize them?

And to whose benefit?\n\nHow do we break away from &lsquo;temporality&rsquo;, precarity and gentrification of spaces for cultural entrepreneurship, for artistic production, and for interesting new work?

But, I do think for a Local newspaper in a local language, if the fee is affordable even for those with minimum wage, this could be an interesting model. \n\nIt's not the model we're interested in with Coda Story. We started out with a fundraiser a few years ago, and are now funded by members, donations, and international donor organizations. But we're trying to figure out how we can rely more on non-pay wall membership, and that's quite \"a puzzle\". \n\nThere are a few organizations looking into how to increase engagement in journalism, and they are worth checking out (because an engaged member, will support you - either through donations or word of mouth):\n\n[The Membership Puzzle](https://membershippuzzle.org/) - founded by NYU professor Jay Rosen\u2019s Studio 20 program and De Corresponden, funded by Knight Foundation, Democracy Fund, and Luminate.\n\n[Hearken](https://www.wearehearken.com/) - for-profit \n\n[Engaged Journalism Accelerator](https://www.engagedjournalism.com/) - run by the European Journalism Centre (EJC), funded by Civil and The News Integrity Initiative", "created_at": "2019-05-13 14:58:36.252493", "updated_at": "2019-05-13 14:58:36.252493", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 260, "wiki": false, "reads": 28, "score": 40.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [53382], "is_liked_by": [2915, 5191], "is_private": false}, {"id": 53565, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 9821, "post_number": 35, "raw": "Usually too busy getting the story.", "created_at": "2019-05-16 01:24:42.271519", "updated_at": "2019-05-16 01:24:42.271519", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 6, "wiki": false, "reads": 25, "score": 10.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [53564], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 53705, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 9821, "post_number": 49, "raw": "[quote=\"inge, post:47, topic:9821\"]\nOr are there forms of advertising that could be more acceptable.\n[/quote]\n\n\nI think of this in terms of value rather than acceptability. When I am browsing the Internet, do I want to see ads? Do they do something for me? Generally, no. They may be beautiful and creative and all that: that's great. When I want to look at pretty pictures and clever videos, I will be searching for them. But if I am not searching for them, I don't want to see or hear them. I prefer to be in charge: the same content may be ham or spam, depending on the context. \n\nSo, the idea here is: ads enable certain business models. But at the same time, they have costs. I remember @matthias saying that 90% of bandwidth is used to convey ad crap. If we did not have that, we could connect the world with a leaner, cheaper, more inclusive experience: no need for 5G, and probably for 4G as well (I have no source for this). I am interested in a rough cost--benefit analysis of ads: ads themselves, I would argue, are almost always on the cost side, even when they are beautiful, because they stand between us and the content we are trying to get to. \n\nOn the other hand, if you go to events like [La nuit des publivores](http://www.nuitdespublivores.be/), ads become a good thing, the very thing you are looking for.", "created_at": "2019-05-21 09:00:38.630882", "updated_at": "2019-05-21 09:00:38.630882", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 251, "wiki": false, "reads": 20, "score": 154.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [53701], "is_reply_to": [53701], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 53732, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 9821, "post_number": 61, "raw": "This is a conversation I would like to see more people in.

Especially ones that scale. During a recent event I heard about through @harryhalpin - I remember him making a point about the money being behind freedom/privacy enhancing solutions. And that building alliances that allow you to reach scale is crucial, and that this can often come from the very actors that are considered problematic. At the same event I came across  [Least authority](https://leastauthority.com/about-us/) which seems to have an interesting model that explores how to collect as little private data as possible by design/default in their software solutions.

This disruptive form of collective agency infiltrate and modify social organizations and (government, research and business) institutions (Chesbrough, 2003; Noubel, 2004); and gives raise to inedited social, economic and political configurations that affect the traditional forms and function(ing) of urban planning and governance (Certom\u00e0 et al.2015).\n\nStepping beyond the dichotomy between the acritical technology-optimism of the smart innovation perspective (Aitamurto, 2012; Prahalad and Ramaswamy 2004) and the radical criticism advanced by the \u201cwisdom of the crowd\u201d discontents (Lanier, 2006; Herzog and Hartwig, 2008), we aim to elaborate a critical appreciation of (1) how traditional urban planning is challenged by the agency of  digital social innovators; and/or (2) what social, political, environment and economic benefits (if any) DSI is bringing to traditional urban governance processes (Passani et al. 2015).\n\nParticularly, we invite theoretical analysis and case-based contributes from scholars and practitioners to explore how digital social innovators are making or not making or could make) cities \u201cmore effective, efficient, sustainable, or just\u201d than before (Deiglemeier and Miller, 2008).\n\nIf interested please send a 250 words abstract with title and 5 keywords to:\n\n [chiara.certoma@UGent.be](mailto:chiara.certoma@UGent.be); [a.passani@t-6.it](mailto:a.passani@t-6.it); [mdyer@waikato.ac.nz](mailto:mdyer@waikato.ac.nz)\n\n**References**\n\nAitamurto T.

Zainspirowani, chcieli\u015bmy zobaczy\u0107, jak mo\u017cemy zaanga\u017cowa\u0107 si\u0119 w podobne sprawy w Lublinie. Przeczytali\u015bmy artyku\u0142 o kobietach, kt\u00f3re zajmowa\u0142y pustostany, czekaj\u0105c na mieszkania komunalne. Liczy\u0142y na to, \u017ce jak je wyremontuj\u0105, to miasto zalegalizuje ich pobyt, tymczasem dyskwalifikowa\u0142o je to i musia\u0142y od pocz\u0105tku zapisywa\u0107 si\u0119 do kolejki, nie wspominaj\u0105c o konsekwencjach karnych za zaj\u0119cie pustostan\u00f3w. Tak si\u0119 zacz\u0119\u0142o. Pami\u0119tam trzy kluczowe wydarzenia, kt\u00f3re moblilizowa\u0142y nas do dzia\u0142ania, nad jakimi pracowali\u015bmy w ci\u0105gu trzech kolejnych lat.\n\nTo by\u0142 rok 2015, gdy w mediach pojawi\u0142a si\u0119 wzmianka o planowanych masowych eksmisjach. Urz\u0119dnicy wynaj\u0119li prywatn\u0105 firm\u0119 z Wroc\u0142awia, \u017ceby wysiedli\u0107 mieszka\u0144c\u00f3w z 15 lokali. Zaplanowano eksmisje w ci\u0105gu tygodnia. Z medi\u00f3w uzyskali\u015bmy informacje o tym, na kt\u00f3rych ulicach odb\u0119d\u0105 si\u0119 wysiedlenia \u2013 \u017cadnych szczeg\u00f3\u0142\u00f3w \u2013 oraz kiedy. Poszli\u015bmy na te ulice i pytali\u015bmy kolejno, czy kto\u015b co\u015b o tym wie. Tak przypadkowo trafili\u015bmy na pierwsz\u0105 eksmisj\u0119, kt\u00f3ra mia\u0142a mie\u0107 miejsce za dwa dni, a potem docierali\u015bmy do kolejnych os\u00f3b z listy.\n\nZacz\u0119li\u015bmy bada\u0107 spraw\u0119 \u2013 uzyskali\u015bmy od urz\u0119du umow\u0119, na podstawie kt\u00f3rej lichwiarska firma mia\u0142a zapewni\u0107 wyrzucanym osobom pomieszczenia tymczasowe. Pojechali\u015bmy noc przed pierwsz\u0105 eksmisj\u0105 do hotelu, w kt\u00f3rym zarezerwowano pokoje dla os\u00f3b eksmitowanych. Okaza\u0142o si\u0119, \u017ce nikt z obs\u0142ugi nic o tym nie wie, rezerwacji dokonano na zupe\u0142nie inn\u0105 firm\u0119, pos\u0142uguj\u0105c si\u0119 fikcyjnymi mailami. Kierowniczka hotelu nie mia\u0142a poj\u0119cia o eksmisjach, nie m\u00f3wi\u0105c ju\u017c o tym, \u017ce nie by\u0142o zgodne z prawem zapewnienie dachu nad g\u0142ow\u0105 zaledwie na dwa tygodnie, zamiast na miesi\u0105c. Rezerwacje zosta\u0142y anulowane.\n\nW tym samym czasie przygotowywali\u015bmy pierwszego lokatora na nadchodz\u0105ce spotkanie z komornikiem. To by\u0142a improwizacja, wtedy nie mieli\u015bmy poj\u0119cia o wi\u0119kszo\u015bci spraw. Powiedzieli\u015bmy mu, co mo\u017ce si\u0119 wydarzy\u0107 i \u017ce po dw\u00f3ch tygodniach zostanie bez dachu nad g\u0142ow\u0105. W dniu eksmisji przyjechali\u015bmy z kamerami i dyktafonami, kto\u015b inny w tym czasie dzwoni\u0142 do Rzecznika Zarz\u0105du Nieruchomo\u015bci Komunalnych i opisa\u0142 sytuacj\u0119 \u2013 brak nocleg\u00f3w i gwarancji, \u017ce lokatorzy b\u0119d\u0105 mieli gdzie mieszka\u0107 przez d\u0142u\u017cszy okres. W ten spos\u00f3b pierwsza ewikcja zosta\u0142a ostatecznie odwo\u0142ana, reszta przesuni\u0119ta. Mieli\u015bmy pierwszy sukces za sob\u0105. Anulowano te\u017c rezerwacje w drugim o\u015brodku.\n\nFirma z komornikiem byli zmuszeni zosta\u0107 w mie\u015bcie d\u0142u\u017cej ni\u017c przewidywano \u2013 przez dwa tygodnie. \u017beby wiedzie\u0107, z kt\u00f3rych mieszka\u0144 jeszcze b\u0119d\u0105 chcieli eksmitowa\u0107 ludzi, je\u017adzili\u015bmy za nimi rowerami. Zrobi\u0142 si\u0119 wok\u00f3\u0142 sprawy du\u017cy szum medialny. Wychodzi\u0142y na jaw coraz to nowe w\u0105tki: jedno z tych mieszka\u0144 by\u0142o puste, osoba mieszkaj\u0105ca w nim zmar\u0142a kilka lat wcze\u015bniej, a urz\u0119dnicy nawet tego wcze\u015bniej nie sprawdzili. Zacz\u0119li\u015bmy rozumie\u0107, \u017ce kompletnie nie zdaj\u0105 sobie sprawy z tego, kogo wyrzucaj\u0105 z tych lokali oraz z tego, jak niehumanitarnie traktowani s\u0105 mieszka\u0144cy, komu zlecili to zadanie. Pod presj\u0105, w ko\u0144cu Prezydent Miasta Lublin i Zarz\u0105d Nieruchomo\u015bci Komunalnych zrezygnowali z pierwszych eksmisji.\n\nP\u00f3\u017aniej trafili\u015bmy do o\u015brodka zast\u0119pczego, do kt\u00f3rego przesiedlano osoby z Lublina po anulowaniu rezerwacji w poprzednich hotelach. To by\u0142a jednostka wojskowa, po\u0142o\u017cona 70 km od miasta i 5 km od najbli\u017cszego przystanku autobusowego, z marnym po\u0142\u0105czeniem z miastem (mo\u017ce raz dziennie). Prowadzi\u0142a go hrabina, kt\u00f3ra mia\u0142a co najmniej jeszcze inny o\u015brodek w Polsce dla os\u00f3b z do\u015bwiadczeniem bezdomno\u015bci. O drugim z nich dwiedzieli\u015bmy si\u0119, \u017ce ludzie mieszkali tam przez pewien czas bez wody i ogrzewania. Opinie mieszka\u0144c\u00f3w by\u0142y podzielone, dla jednych by\u0142a to szansa. Na przyk\u0142ad dla by\u0142ego wi\u0119\u017ania kt\u00f3ry w zamian za dach nad g\u0142ow\u0105 remontowa\u0142 mieszkania w tych budynkach, pracuj\u0105c bez wynagrodzenia i oddawa\u0142 po\u0142ow\u0119 swoich przychod\u00f3w na rzecz o\u015brodka. Dla innych ten sam uk\u0142ad by\u0142 nie do przyj\u0119cia: praca za darmo nad remontami, oddawanie reszty zarobk\u00f3w na utrzymanie. Wiele os\u00f3b pogr\u0105\u017ca\u0142o si\u0119 tam w trudnej sytuacji, niekt\u00f3rzy szybko wyje\u017cd\u017cali.\n\nMusieli\u015bmy te\u017c zdecydowa\u0107, czy i jak sprawdza\u0107, czy ta sp\u00f3\u0142ka lichwiarska, kt\u00f3rej zlecono masowe eksmisje, faktycznie wsp\u00f3\u0142pracowa\u0142a z wieloma samorz\u0105dami w kraju i korzysta\u0142a z publicznych \u015brodk\u00f3w \u2013 jak informowa\u0142a na swojej stronie internetowej. Pr\u00f3bowali\u015bmy uzyska\u0107 od nich te informacje, ale robili wszystko, \u017ceby ich nie udost\u0119pni\u0107. Sprawa sko\u0144czy\u0142a si\u0119 w s\u0105dzie, ukarano ich grzywn\u0105 \u2013 ale nie wiemy wci\u0105\u017c, jaka jest skala ich dzia\u0142ania. Nie chcemy pyta\u0107 bezpo\u015brednio samorz\u0105d\u00f3w, bo boimy si\u0119, \u017ce cz\u0119\u015b\u0107 z nich dowie si\u0119 o takiej mo\u017cliwo\u015bci i zacznie korzysta\u0107 z ich us\u0142ug.\n\nDzi\u0119ki do\u015bwiadczeniu z eksmisjami zrozumieli\u015bmy, \u017ce w Lublinie brakuje polityki mieszkaniowej \u2013 a obecna jej namiastka opiera si\u0119 na zupe\u0142nej nieznajomo\u015bci sytuacji os\u00f3b w zad\u0142u\u017conych mieszkaniach komunalnych. Na przyk\u0142ad osoby, kt\u00f3rych d\u0142ug nie przekracza\u0142 30 tysi\u0119cy z\u0142otych mog\u0142y skorzysta\u0107 z programu, dzi\u0119ki kt\u00f3remu go odpracuj\u0105 \u2013 ale trzeba spe\u0142nia\u0107 r\u00f3\u017cne kryteria: by\u0107 jednocze\u015bnie bezrobotnym i korzysta\u0107 z pomocy spo\u0142ecznej. Odpracowuj\u0105c d\u0142ug, nie jeste\u015b w stanie utrzyma\u0107 si\u0119, bo w tym czasie nie pracujesz, wi\u0119c wiele os\u00f3b decyduje si\u0119 na znalezienie pracy w szarej strefie, z nadziej\u0105, \u017ce poza utrzymaniem siebie i rodziny, mo\u017ce wystarczy te\u017c na sp\u0142at\u0119 zaleg\u0142o\u015bci. Z regu\u0142y nie wystarcza. Reszta mo\u017ce podj\u0105\u0107 pr\u00f3b\u0119 dogadania si\u0119 z urz\u0119dnikami. Dwie niesp\u0142acone w terminie czynsze albo raty ugody r\u00f3wna si\u0119 eksmisja.\n\nZad\u0142u\u017cenie mieszka\u0144c\u00f3w w mie\u015bcie to ok 200 mln z\u0142, wi\u0119kszo\u015b\u0107 z tej kwoty jest nie do odzyskania \u2013 ale urz\u0119dnicy nie korzystaj\u0105 ch\u0119tnie, a nawet nie informuj\u0105, o mo\u017cliwo\u015bci cz\u0119\u015bciowego lub ca\u0142kowitego umorzenia, mimo \u017ce taki instrument istnieje od wielu lat. A ludzie popadaj\u0105 w spiral\u0119 zad\u0142u\u017cenia. Czasami zdarzy si\u0119 jaki\u015b wyj\u0105tek. Na przyk\u0142ad staruszka z 90 tys. z\u0142 d\u0142ugu \u2013 uznano, \u017ce nie ma szans na jego sp\u0142at\u0119. Co wi\u0119cej, po\u0142owa d\u0142ugu lokatorskiego to odsetki i op\u0142aty komornicze \u2013 i te kwoty rosn\u0105 bez przerwy. Urz\u0119dnicy zrobili z tego d\u0142ugu narz\u0119dzie propagandowe i straszak. Opowiadaj\u0105 w mediach stereotypy o &quot;paso\u017cytach&quot;, nierobach i alkoholikach, kt\u00f3rzy nie do\u015b\u0107, \u017ce \u017ceruj\u0105 na kieszeni p\u0142ac\u0105cego czynsz mieszka\u0144ca Lublina, to jeszcze dewastuj\u0105 mieszkania komunalne. Ciekawe co na to nauczyciel akademicki, kt\u00f3ry mieszka w barakach socjalnych poza miastem, bo na tyle go sta\u0107. I ka\u017cda inna osoba, kt\u00f3ra wbrew swoim mo\u017cliwo\u015bciom finansowym, z problemami zostaje zupe\u0142nie sama, a dorabia si\u0119 jej tak\u0105 \u201eg\u0119b\u0119\u201d.\n\nD\u0142ugiem dotkni\u0119tych jest ponad po\u0142owa lokali komunalnych w Lublinie \u2013 w wi\u0119kszo\u015bci zamieszkanych przez rodziny, wi\u0119c w rzeczywisto\u015bci liczba os\u00f3b zad\u0142u\u017conych jest znacznie wi\u0119ksza. I tu zacz\u0105\u0142 si\u0119 drugi du\u017cy temat jaki podj\u0119li\u015bmy - tzw. programu odd\u0142u\u017ceniowego. Zacz\u0119li\u015bmy apelowa\u0107 do Prezydenta Miasta, \u017ceby stworzy\u0142 polityk\u0119 mieszkaniow\u0105 dostosowan\u0105 do potrzeb i mo\u017cliwo\u015bci lokator\u00f3w \u2013 \u017ceby po prostu sprawdzili, dlaczego ludzie nie p\u0142ac\u0105, znie\u015bli bariery instytucjonalne i minimalizowali u ludzi strach zwi\u0105zany ze zwr\u00f3ceniem si\u0119 o pomoc do urz\u0119du. Wiele z lokator\u00f3w i lokatorek po prostu boi si\u0119 i\u015b\u0107 i prosi\u0107 ZNK o pomoc. Apelowali\u015bmy te\u017c o to, \u017ceby cz\u0119\u015bciej korzystali z cz\u0119\u015bciowego i ca\u0142kowitego umorzenia d\u0142ug\u00f3w, zainicjowali wsp\u00f3\u0142prac\u0119 mi\u0119dzy instytucjami, tak\u0105, kt\u00f3ra da realn\u0105 mo\u017cliwo\u015b\u0107 sp\u0142aty i wyj\u015bcia z problem\u00f3w oraz regularnego p\u0142acenia czynszu. Przecie\u017c to korzy\u015b\u0107 dla wszystkich i realna pomoc.\n\nZNK niech\u0119tnie zgodzi\u0142a si\u0119 na konsultacje programu odd\u0142u\u017ceniowego, kt\u00f3ry zdecydowali si\u0119 przygotowa\u0107. Zorganizowali je w ma\u0142ym pomieszczeniu, na kt\u00f3re sami zaprosili\u015bmy go\u015bci, bo ZNK si\u0119 tym nie chcia\u0142o zaj\u0105\u0107. Nie przysz\u0142a \u017cadna osoba z kierownictwa \u2013 a rozmowa toczy\u0142a si\u0119 g\u0142\u00f3wnie wok\u00f3\u0142 szerokich problem\u00f3w, z kt\u00f3rymi si\u0119 mierzymy, bo by\u0142o to pierwsze takie forum dla Lublina. Nie przygotowali\u015bmy rozwi\u0105za\u0144, zabrak\u0142o na to czasu, ZNK uzna\u0142o, \u017ce kolejne spotkania za &quot;niezasadne&quot;, pomimo pr\u00f3\u015bb o ich zorganizowanie i stworzenie forum wsp\u00f3\u0142pracy czy cia\u0142a doradczego. Podczas kilku miesi\u0119cy prac nad nowym programem odd\u0142u\u017ceniowym nie pokazano nam projektu \u2013 odsy\u0142ano nas bez przerwy do r\u00f3\u017cnych miejsc, w ko\u0144cu stwierdzono, \u017ce projekt jest dokumentem wewn\u0119trznym i nie mo\u017cna go pokaza\u0107. Kiedy wreszcie go zobaczyli\u015bmy, na kilka dni przed uchwaleniem, mieli\u015bmy ma\u0142o czasu na przygotowanie opinii i wys\u0142anie analizy oraz swojego stanowiska do radnych. Chodzili\u015bmy na komisje rady miasta, namawiali\u015bmy radnych do jego odrzucenia \u2013 za pierwszym razem nam si\u0119 uda\u0142o, za drugim - projekt przeszed\u0142 bez poprawek. Wcze\u015bniej radni zorganizowali otwart\u0105 dyskusj\u0119 na ten temat i pomys\u0142y, jakie tam pojawia\u0142y si\u0119 oraz niewiedza radnych zszokowa\u0142a nas. Np.: zaproponowano nam jako Lubelskiej Akcji Lokatorskiej, \u017ceby\u015bmy z radnymi chodzili po mieszkaniach os\u00f3b zad\u0142u\u017conych i sprawdzali, czy maj\u0105 oni telewizory i kom\u00f3rki, pytali s\u0105siad\u00f3w, czy maj\u0105 samoch\u00f3d, je\u015bli sami nie powiedz\u0105. Wszystko po to, \u017ceby oceni\u0107 sytuacj\u0119 maj\u0105tkow\u0105 lokator\u00f3w i lokatorek. Czas realizacji programu odd\u0142u\u017ceniowego w wersji zaproponowanej przez urz\u0119dnik\u00f3w nied\u0142ugo si\u0119 sko\u0144czy i przyjrzymy si\u0119 jego rezultatom \u2013 ale wiemy ju\u017c, \u017ce odzyskano dzi\u0119ki niemu zaledwie 1% d\u0142ugu. Trudno spodziewa\u0107 si\u0119 sukcesu po dobraniu narz\u0119dzi sp\u0142aty zad\u0142u\u017cenia nieadekwatnych do sytuacji ludzi.\n\nZ jednej strony, pierwsze lata by\u0142y bardzo intensywne i interesuj\u0105ce dla nas jako grupy \u2013 wszystko by\u0142o nowe, du\u017co si\u0119 uczyli\u015bmy, konsultowali\u015bmy z innymi organizacjami. To by\u0142 okres mojego najwi\u0119kszego personalnego rozwoju. Ale eksmisje by\u0142y te\u017c wyczerpuj\u0105ce \u2013 ci\u0105g\u0142e konfrontacje, towarzysz\u0105ce im emocje, nieznajomo\u015b\u0107 prawa i sytuacji. Trzeba zda\u0107 sobie spraw\u0119, \u017ce zar\u00f3wno czy\u015bciciele kamienic, lichwiarska firma, jak i komornicy, z kt\u00f3rymi mieli\u015bmy do czynienia, zazwyczaj nie byli otwarci na dialog i szukanie rozwi\u0105zania. Jeden z komornik\u00f3w przyszed\u0142 wcze\u015bniej do lokator\u00f3w ni\u017c wskaza\u0142 w zawiadomieniu o eksmisji i manipulowa\u0142 informacjami w taki spos\u00f3b, \u017ceby zach\u0119ci\u0107 ich do \u201edobrowolnego\u201d odej\u015bcia. W tej rodzinie by\u0142y problemy alkoholowe, mieli bardzo nisk\u0105 \u015bwiadomo\u015b\u0107 prawn\u0105, dlatego zgodzili si\u0119 podpisa\u0107 dokumenty pod presj\u0105, a gdy powiedzieli\u015bmy im jakie s\u0105 konsekwencje, nie mogli ju\u017c tego podpisu wycofa\u0107. W silnym wzburzeniu - podczas tej eksmisji - protok\u00f3\u0142 zosta\u0142 podarty, a komornik wni\u00f3s\u0142 oskar\u017cenie przeciwko osobie z naszej grupy, kt\u00f3ra to zrobi\u0142a. Oczywi\u015bcie, maj\u0105c pe\u0142n\u0105 wiedz\u0119, lokatorzy drugi raz protoko\u0142u ju\u017c nie podpisali.\n\nTrzecim tematem, z jakim zmagali\u015bmy si\u0119 by\u0142o &quot;czyszczenie kamienic&quot;. Nauczyli\u015bmy si\u0119, \u017ce czy\u015bciciele kamienic w Polsce s\u0105 dobrze zorganizowani \u2013 to elitarna grupa, kt\u00f3ra zna prawo, wymienia si\u0119 u\u0142amkami w\u0142asno\u015bci budynk\u00f3w, dzieli informacjami, wsp\u00f3\u0142pracuje strategicznie przeciwko lokatorom. S\u0105 nawet strony internetowe, na kt\u00f3rych mo\u017cesz przeczyta\u0107, jak w 10 krokach pozby\u0107 si\u0119 mieszka\u0144c\u00f3w \u2013 prawnie i bezprawnie, ale skutecznie. O wiele \u0142atwiej o dost\u0119p do takich informacji, ni\u017c do tego, jak uzyska\u0107 pomoc.\n\nJedn\u0105 z takich sytuacji by\u0142a sprawa czy\u015bciciela z Lublina, kt\u00f3ry jednocze\u015bnie by\u0142 (i dalej jest) radnym jednej z dzielnic. Jest cz\u0142onkiem PISu, i nauczycielem WOSu w publicznej szkole. Po kupieniu jednej z kamienic (kt\u00f3rej ostatnia zarz\u0105dczyni znikn\u0119\u0142a lata wcze\u015bniej, nie upominaj\u0105c si\u0119 o czynsz ani nie interesuj\u0105c si\u0119 stanem budynku), przyszed\u0142 bez \u017cadnych dokument\u00f3w i kaza\u0142 wszystkim si\u0119 wyprowadzi\u0107, bo rzekomo budynek grozi zawaleniem. Da\u0142 im na to 10 godzin. Mieszka\u0144cy nie mieli dok\u0105d p\u00f3j\u015b\u0107, wi\u0119c zostali w kamienicy. Wtedy w\u0142a\u015bciciel zacz\u0105\u0142 przyje\u017cd\u017ca\u0107 i upomina\u0107 si\u0119 o niebotyczne kwoty, zg\u0142asza\u0107 zupe\u0142nie bezprawne roszczenia, zawiadamia\u0142 prokuratur\u0119 o kradzie\u017c okien itd.. Wni\u00f3s\u0142 do s\u0105du spraw\u0119 o eksmisj\u0119. Zosta\u0142a uznana za bezpodstawn\u0105, a zachowanie w\u0142a\u015bciciela s\u0119dzia okre\u015bli\u0142a jako niezgodne z zasadami wsp\u00f3\u0142\u017cycia spo\u0142ecznego. Lokatorka, kt\u00f3ra jako pierwsza \u2013 trzy lata temu \u2013 wyprowadzi\u0142a si\u0119 z kamienicy, do tej pory jest oskar\u017cana przez kamienicznika o znies\u0142awienie i zdewastowanie lokalu. To od pocz\u0105tku by\u0142o jawne n\u0119kanie psychiczne przez niego. Mieszkania w tym budynku by\u0142y ma\u0142e (16 m2), podmok\u0142e, zagrzybione, ogrzewane elektrycznymi grzejnikami, z prowizorycznymi \u0142azienkami, zbudowanymi przez lokator\u00f3w. Czy\u015bciciel pr\u00f3bowa\u0142 r\u00f3\u017cnych krok\u00f3w a\u017c w ko\u0144cu zacz\u0105\u0142 podnosi\u0107 czynsz i ludzie wyprowadzili si\u0119. Ciekawe, \u017ce wykona\u0142 tylko od\u015bwie\u017cenie elewacji i remont kilku lokal\u00f3w, kt\u00f3re dzisiaj wynajmuje za rynkowe stawki studentom. Jednak stan kamienicy nie by\u0142 tak tragiczny. Ale z lokator\u00f3w, kt\u00f3rzy mieszkali tam po kilkadziesi\u0105t lat, nie zosta\u0142 nikt.\n\nDo sukces\u00f3w Lubelskiej Akcji Lokatorskiej zaliczam to, \u017ce temat sytuacji lokator\u00f3w i lokatorek oraz mieszka\u0144 komunalnych czy czyszczenia kamienic w og\u00f3le zacz\u0105\u0142 pojawia\u0107 si\u0119 w lokalnych mediach i na j\u0119zykach loaklnych polityk\u00f3w \u2013 niekt\u00f3rzy maj\u0105 nawet doradc\u00f3w do spraw mieszkaniowych. Bardzo blisko wsp\u00f3\u0142pracowali\u015bmy z mediami. Dawali nam mo\u017cliwo\u015b\u0107 nag\u0142o\u015bnienia r\u00f3\u017cncyh spraw i naszej perspektywy, co przyczyni\u0142o si\u0119 do tego sukcesu. Nawi\u0105zali\u015bmy wsp\u00f3\u0142prac\u0119 z innymi grupami w Polsce, zajmuj\u0105cymi si\u0119 tym problemem \u2013 cho\u0107 jest ich niewiele. Uda\u0142o nam si\u0119 zorganizowa\u0107 dni lokatorskie, z panelami i dyskusjami dotycz\u0105cymi najwa\u017cniejszych problem\u00f3w w r\u00f3\u017cnych miastach. Te same problemy s\u0105 we wszystkich gminach, tylko maj\u0105 r\u00f3\u017cne rozmiary. Natomiast ka\u017cd\u0105 z nich \u201ewyr\u00f3\u017cnia\u201d taki problem, kt\u00f3ry dana grupa lokatorska w szczeg\u00f3lnie podnosi: w Lublinie to by\u0142o i jest odd\u0142u\u017cenie oraz brak mieszka\u0144 komunalnych, w Warszawie reprywatyzacja, w Poznanie brutalni czy\u015bciciele kamienic.\n\nPo ponad trzech intensywnych latach LAL powoli zacz\u0105\u0142 si\u0119 rozpada\u0107 \u2013 z 9 os\u00f3b pozosta\u0142o nas 2 czy 3. Nie szukamy ju\u017c aktywnie spraw, odbieramy tylko telefony alarmowe i reagujemy na nie. Cz\u0119\u015b\u0107 z nas musia\u0142a si\u0119 wyprowadzi\u0107 w poszukiwaniu pracy, inni nie dawali rady emocjonalnie. Czasem nag\u0142a\u015bniamy jaki\u015b wa\u017cny temat. Ostatnio pisali\u015bmy o nowym pomy\u015ble Prezydenta Miasta \u2013 postawienia kontener\u00f3w, jako &quot;kary&quot; dla lokator\u00f3w z zad\u0142u\u017conych mieszka\u0144. Lublin nie jest odosobniony w takich &quot;nowatorskich&quot; rozwi\u0105zaniach. W innych miastach rozwa\u017caj\u0105 np.: wprowadzenie pr\u0105du i ogrzewania na \u017cetony, czyli jak ci\u0119 nie sta\u0107, marznij w zimie, a w lecie paruj si\u0119 w kontenerowej puszce. Mieszka\u0144 komunalnych brakuje te\u017c dlatego, \u017ce wiele z tych zbudowanych w PRLu oddano w prywatne r\u0119ce (mimo, \u017ce obiecano je lokatorom w mieszkaniach zak\u0142adowych, kt\u00f3rzy zreszt\u0105 sami je budowali). Urz\u0119dnicy wol\u0105 odda\u0107 tereny deweloperom, a z budownictwa komunalnego - dawa\u0107 ofert\u0119 g\u0142\u00f3wnie dla tzw. klasy \u015bredniej. Konsekwentnie pomijaj\u0105 najubo\u017csz\u0105 grup\u0119 lokator\u00f3w.\n\nPrzez te wszystkie lata zobaczy\u0142am, jak bardzo brakuje w Polsce solidarno\u015bci spo\u0142ecznej. I \u017ce ostracyzm wobec takich praktyk urz\u0119dniczych nie istnieje. Ci\u0105gle niekt\u00f3rzy ludzie wierz\u0105, \u017ce lokatorzy mieszka\u0144 komunalnych okradaj\u0105 reszt\u0119 spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwa, wierz\u0105 w mit w\u0142asnego samodzielnego sukcesu, i twierdz\u0105, \u017ce takim &quot;spo\u0142ecznym paso\u017cytom&quot; nie nale\u017cy pomaga\u0107. Uwa\u017cam, \u017ce konieczna jest kampania spo\u0142eczna pokazuj\u0105ca, \u017ce tego typu problemy wynikaj\u0105 z r\u00f3\u017cnych okoliczno\u015bci, na kt\u00f3re nie zawsze mamy wp\u0142yw - choroba, wypadki, traumy, wychowanie itd. To s\u0105 problemy spo\u0142eczne, nie indywidualne. I mam wra\u017cenie, \u017ce poza narastaj\u0105cym podzia\u0142em spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwa i frustracj\u0105 np.: lokator\u00f3w i innych potrzebuj\u0105cych pomocy grup, ro\u015bnie z\u0142o\u015b\u0107 klasy \u015bredniej. Na niej skupia si\u0119 teraz rz\u0105d, np.: uszczelniaj\u0105c podatki, co uderza bezpo\u015brednio w dochody przedsi\u0119biorc\u00f3w. To oni b\u0119d\u0105 mieli coraz cz\u0119\u015bciej wra\u017cenie, \u017ce s\u0142absza reszta na nich paso\u017cytuje, a oni sami ubo\u017cej\u0105 ich kosztem. Nic bardziej mylnego. Wzajemnie siebie potrzebujemy i bronienie spo\u0142ecznych czy finansowych dysproporcji jest szkodliwe dla wszystkich grup spo\u0142ecznych - w bli\u017cszej albo w dalszej perspektywie.\n\nCz\u0119\u015b\u0107 moich znajomych, kt\u00f3ra zdecydowa\u0142a si\u0119 zosta\u0107 w Lublinie, czy innych miejscach, gdzie zarabia si\u0119 mniej ni\u017c w pozosta\u0142ych regionach kraju, uznaje za du\u017cy sukces wyp\u0142at\u0119 na poziomie 2000-2500 z\u0142 miesi\u0119cznie. To dla mnie frustruj\u0105ce i - szczerze m\u00f3wi\u0105c - zaczyna mi brakowa\u0107 motywacji, \u017ceby zosta\u0107 w Lublinie, kt\u00f3ry zreszt\u0105 od zawsze uwa\u017ca\u0142am za swoje miejsce do \u017cycia. Od ponad 10 lat pracowa\u0142am w organizacjach pozarz\u0105dowych, a przez ostatni rok jako ksi\u0119gowa w sektorze prywatnym. Nierzadko by\u0142am zatrudniona w kilku miejscach jednocze\u015bnie. Mam stale poczucie, \u017ce nak\u0142ad pracy w por\u00f3wnaniu do mojego wynagrodzenia jest nieadekwatny. Poziom mojej frustracji spowodowanej brakiem stabilno\u015bci finansowej spowodowa\u0142, \u017ce mam coraz wi\u0119ksz\u0105 potrzeb\u0119 zmiany otoczenia i wyjazdu. Mieszkam w wynajmowanym mieszkaniu, nie mam oszcz\u0119dno\u015bci, kt\u00f3re pozwoli\u0142yby mi na kupienie w\u0142asnego, nie odziedziczy\u0142am mieszkania czy czegokolwiek innego. Mam za to ten komfort, \u017ce jestem moblina, nie mam dzieci, i mam gdzie wr\u00f3ci\u0107. Mog\u0119 w ka\u017cdym momencie co\u015b zmieni\u0107 radykalnie.

Is Uber a tech company or a taxi company? Is Airbnb a platform or a hotel business? I am fresh from a long conversation with Amelia Andersdotter (@teirdes). She explained that the legal consequences of sticking a label on things are very far-reaching. If I understand her reasoning, she advocates: \n\n1. Taking a long, hard look at the emergent consequences of the way these companies do business before taking action. \n1. Mapping these consequences against the values that we would like society to uphold. This can be messy. In the case of Uber, some people dislike the relatively low compensation that many drivers appear to get for their time. But some others point to the fact that Uber has made taxi travel safe for Indian women. Women do not like to take taxis in India, because drivers have been known to demand more money than agreed once the car is in motion and the client has left the safety of her house. There have been cases of harassment, too. Uber does not have these problems, because (1) the price or a ride is established and (2) the identity of the driver is known, and the company is credible when it threatens consequences against misbehaving drivers.\n1. Only after this move in to regulate. \n\nI am probably representing this quite clumsily, Amelia herself could do it much better.", "created_at": "2019-05-07 13:21:07.157095", "updated_at": "2019-05-07 13:21:07.157095", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 252, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 11.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [53168], "is_reply_to": [53168], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 53209, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 9858, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Often regulation is one or more steps behind the innovative entity that acts in ways the call out for some regulation.  In Uber's case, it does seem like the taxi cab industry, at least in the US, was so complacent that it was ripe for serious disruption.  With AirBnB it's more complicated because an unintended consequence is how much it has changed the rental picture for local residents, which has large social impact.  In Facebook's case, they seem to just want to run out ahead of any regulation, because, I think, they want to constantly adjust their models to maximize their ROI from all the data gathering.\n\nI can sympathize with FB's view in a sense.  Back when I started and managed sfgate.com, it was owned by a company that had thousands of employees, both union and non-union.  The unionized workers were represented by no less than 14 separate unions.  Naturally they wanted to represent my employees too.  I, as a lifelong union sympathizer and former union member myself (Machinists International), thought that someday it would be appropriate for them to represent the workers on my crew.  But not at first because they would enforce rules written long ago for a different industry with clear divisions of labor and that would stifle the quick movements we required to be innovative.

A publisher makes editorial choices and takes responsibility for the consequences of that content.  It used to be a pretty clear distinction until online conversation networks came along.\n\nIn the early days, those of us who managed those online conversation networks, including big companies like America Online, argued that we shouldn't be held liable for everything that the users say to each other, because for one thing, we would have to pre-approve everything that got posted, which most users would find intolerable.  Or we would have to actively censor whatever we found objectionable.  So for the most part people said whatever they wanted and dealt with the liability or libel issues themselves.  In 1996 in the USA, Congress passed the Communications Decency Act that did a number of things, mainly related to obscenity and minors, but included section 230 which make online services immune from liability for the content posted on those companies' sites.  In 1997 the Supreme Court struck down most of the CDA, but kept Section 230.  This was all before social media as we know it was even dreamed up.\n\nSo into this legal framework came social media operations that gained audience far beyond anything any other online service had ever seen or even likely dreamed of.  And with the advent of the Facebook 'news feed' began the process we find ourselves in today where the companies actively manipulate what we see on our screens to maximize our desire to stay on the site, or return to it often, and to feed us a lot of what we want to see and hear so we might buy the things the advertisers show to us.  Whether they intended it or not, this actively contributes to a more polarized society according to numerous studies and essays.  \n\nAnd now, Facebook has banned extremist individuals outright.\n\nSo are they a platform or a publisher?  They say they are a platform when they want that shielding from the law and they admit to being a publisher when they want to get rid of what they consider to be hate speech or people who espouse violence.\n\nBut when the New Zealand mass shooter spread that video all around Facebook, Facebook used the shield of a platform to avoid liability for spreading it, but then they wanted to be a publisher when they banned it.  And let us remember that while that video was viewed on their platform millions of times, they made money off the ads that ran along with it.", "created_at": "2019-05-07 03:43:19.630949", "updated_at": "2019-05-07 03:43:19.630949", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 452, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 67.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 53293, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 9858, "post_number": 7, "raw": "This [New York Times editorial by Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/opinion/sunday/chris-hughes-facebook-zuckerberg.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share) is well worth your time.\n\nRelevant to this topic he says, \" Mark used to insist that Facebook was just a \u201csocial utility,\u201d a neutral platform for people to communicate what they wished.

Which is kind of a relief. It is not, because there is a coercive element: the Makerfox himself (algorithms that decide which of the alternatively possible deals to execute).\n\nAs you noted, it is futile to try correcting a market failure with more inclusive pricing. I guess it is futile because most of the price corrections need coercion to be implemented (like air pollution rights), and our political system with its entangled elites is incapable of deciding to do all this and to enforce all this.\n\nHowever, since we can't have perfect markets anyway, we could also try to fix the worst market failures with \"good\" transaction coercion. This is how it could be done in a large-scale network barter economy, resulting in a semi-planned economy. The price signal is still there, but only used to indicate subjective preferences and subjectively measured efforts. It is no longer the only decision parameter for market clearing, rather one of many. In the case of Makerfox, we have at least the following: (1) income = expenses for all users in a barter deal (obviously; the basic condition), (2) commission credit level of users, (3) percentage of commission payments from total turnover (max. 30%), (4) being frugal with \"liquid items\" like worktime and donations, as they are needed to plug holes in future deals, (5) minimizing percentage of cash money and added barter-value donation contributions in instant deals, because we want to replace the need for money as much as possible. We could incorporate more parameters to work against perceived market failures, such as: (6) favoring order alternatives that go to small businesses, (7) charging an additional commission for sales of certain environmentally damaging products, then forwarding it to a project that tidies up.\n\nIn a voluntary network economy plaform, we obviously can't instantiate any rules we want, as people would leave and build their own platform. But there is a lot of space for bending the rules and transactions in a way that people do not consciously notice (since network barter transactions are unpredictable anyway).\n\nJust like I argued above for monetary functions, I think market price is not \"all bad\" in a stewardship context: one can take some aspects and build a better system from it. It will not be a market, but offer some of the affordances of a market that \"direct action\" stewardship models lack and often need direly. Like indirect contributions, compensation mechanisms for contributions of detached third parties, compensatio mechanisms for \"load balancing\" between direct contributors etc..\n\n", "created_at": "2015-01-28 03:18:06", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:37.495996", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 474, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [28142], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 53271, "user_id": 4779, "topic_id": 9872, "post_number": 1, "raw": "_Co v\u00e1s zaj\u00edm\u00e1?_\n_Kdo zaji\u0161\u0165uje p\u00e9\u010di ve va\u0161\u00ed rodin\u011b, ve va\u0161em m\u011bst\u011b?_\n_Kdo by se m\u011bl starat o st\u00e1rnouc\u00ed lidi?

At the latest, we'll do it when we have the new recruits.\n\nFor the German mapping, Richard discovered many groups on the meetup.com platform, some of whom have other websites/ fb group; in Germany Meetup is very Berlin centric, but worth the look.\nNB: those interested in the German language conversations should make personal effort to reach out - it's not a given that Edgeryders has capacity to go through the list. \n\nNoticing the differences between the |German and British system - should immigrants pay in the system? should they be covered?\n\n**3.

Examples include:\n\n* the industrialized food system, which includes massive advertising for unhealthy eatable stuff, heavily processed an addictive food, industrially grown \"organic\" products, commercialized \"fair trade\" products with hollow promises and branded basic food items (which did not exist until the 1920s / 1930s)\n\n* the waste management system, with contracts setting the incentives against political measures for trash reduction, as the promise a certain amount of (profitable) trash to the collection companies \u2026 which then use the plastic for example like free fuel and just burn it in power stations to profit from the electricity (I know this in detail from a certain medium-sized city over here \u2026)\n\n* delusional advertising on for-profit TV stations \u2026 while this was a point of discourse in the late 90s here in Germany, now everyone has just become used to it\n\n* the housing market, which has in many places morphed from a market to fulfill the basic need of accommodation to a market to fulfill the desire of investors and landlords for ROI / profits\n\n* \u2026 and there is of course more, you name it\n\nThat's just to illustrate: the Internet is going the only way that has been prepared for it by an industrial, oligopolist, capital-intensive, consumption-driven economic system.

The Stockholm workshop on 11th of May was preceded by a presentation by Alberto Cottica about collective intelligence which gathered about 40 people. We had a Q&A after the presentation which was very engaged and unfortunately we had to cut the Q&A in order to stat the workshop.\n\nDuring the workshop we went through the following steps:\n\n- \u201cInterestmapping\u201d (What We Care About)\n- Listening Triads\n- Collaboration Mosaic A - Personal statement\n- Collaboration Mosaic B - Resource Mapping\n\n**What was shared/learned in the workshop?**\n\nI believe there was shared a collective understanding throughout the workshop that there are a lot of us \"out there\" who not only talk but also walk about building the Internet of Humans, to become a better place.\n\n**My reflections**\n\nReflections since the process is that I would have liked to have done more in terms of giving room for participants to present themselves as whole humans. This time we jumped straight into talk and documentation, not really setting the stage and giving space for background \u2013 because we had a lot of ground to cover.\n\n- I felt that there was an immense and deep knowledge in the room. There was also representatives from all sectors of society (academia, civil, public, business, interest groups - maybe more?) which I think is a great start for an event like this. It\u2019s requirement for leveraging system change to involve stakeholders from all sectors. I am really happy that I got the feedback from participants that they want to continue and explore collaboration, this was a seed planted to further building of relationships and collaboration and that is good as it was the intention.\n\n- As we had little time left after the exercises we could not share the results in plenum. However I am sure people will be interested to check the documentation online now afterwards and continue to look forward to forum discussions and the next event.\n\n**Connecting with some questions/concepts I feel are worth exploring for Internet of Humans**\n\nSome questions:\n\n- How can we work with the idea of expanding on distributed events / festivals to connect to the power of digital and analog? Some inspiration from u.lab and their online course with local hubs connecting local changemakers:\nhttps://www.presencing.org/u-lab-s\nhttps://www.edx.org/course/ulab-leading-change-in-times-of-disruption\n\n- How can we organize for physical and online prototypes on multi-location basis?\n\nI personally see a concept (or paradigm) that I also work with as an interesting strategic approach with how and what the Edgeryders community intend to do with this project - leveraging systemic change. There is a course about this in August 21-23 2019 in Stockholm. https://courses.complexity.university/ \n\nI have talked a little bit with @hugi about it but I want to share it with all of you. This course is more for the organizational and social level of the work, not the technical level. This connects to my thread on how to develop the Internet as a society and humanity. The thread transformed into a conceptual thread on Holochain and SSB technologies. I find it interesting that something I asked (quite abstractly) about a social issue, looking for social approaches to find social solutions, transformed into a thread about technical approaches and technical solutions to a social challenge. That points to some interesting things to me, about discernment, thinking, conversation, the field and perhaps also our tech-anthropocentric age.\n\nI think I can see how a lot of issues stemming from being social issues are approached with technical solutions.", "created_at": "2019-05-17 15:47:46.014543", "updated_at": "2019-07-02 17:12:17.268207", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 606, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 52.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4022, 5083], "is_private": false}, {"id": 54436, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 9894, "post_number": 5, "raw": "@nadia - just to confirm, i will go to this one and stay one more day as there is a presentation of a multiciltural map of Warsaw happening as well, which I want to use to get some stories.\n\nAlso, i would like to make a second trip a week earlier to attend a [convention](https://biennalewarszawa.pl/konwencja-rolniczek/) of female farmers at biennale - i wrote to the organisers and they added me to the closed session on Friday the 14th  where we will work in different groups on various issues around farming  climate change and feminism.

I think this chimes with your experience in Brussels @noemi ?\n[/quote]\n\nIn Brussels we did have artists in, and you could see in the talk about access and maintenance of spaces that they put themselves at the centre of the groups losing a lot due to lack of ownership and control over them. Those in the room who were more managers, facilitators, academics and urban experts in general tended to position themselves slightly differently - looking more at what society tends to lose if there is no access to assets, and *how* the game is being played strategically. This is a bit of a simplification, but obviously you can see the value in having both at the table.\n\nI was suprised you mention 'change has to come from the artists' - perhaps more in funding and production of local artistic work, highly contextualized this is true. In the case of getting spaces, using infrastructure it felt for me there is more of a need of concerted action, ecosystem level.\nI liked that we had a lot of urban practitioners in the group because navigating the political landscape and even just getting intelligence right is valuable to start anything.\n\n\n[quote=\"alex_levene, post:1, topic:9918\"]\nDo businesses have a responsibility to fund arts &amp; culture directly? - attaching your artistic product to businesses can be a difficult issue - people want to know what their brand is being attached to(and visa versa).\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"alex_levene, post:1, topic:9918\"]\nFrustration that the economic argument is the only way to get through \u2018at the moment\u2019.

If you happen to see posts in languages other than your own don't hesitate to translate the page i.e. in English and leave comments in any language.  \n\n**We have the first ever [story in Czech](https://edgeryders.eu/t/lekaruv-pacient-nebo-pacientuv-lekar/9893) on Edgeryders!** Meet @Jirka_Kocian, researcher at Charles University in Prague, who shares his story of feeling trapped in a 90s public hospital in Bohemia, with a broken leg. He felt like he was in a house of horror, where doctors and nurses had to work hundreds of hours of unpaid overtime for ridiculous money. Similarly, his friend is struggling to fight off inaccurate medication that made her symptoms worse!\n\n[quote]\nWhat experience do you have in making your own decisions about your medical care? Have you experienced anything from a healthcare perspective that you would have done differently as patients in retrospect? \n[/quote]\n\n\n**Tremendous stories from Poland!** The lovely @pwawrzynczyk titled hers: 'How I became a sex educator'. After 13 years of activism and volunteerism, her passion has become her work and London, where she is based now, provides that opportunity. \n\n[quote]\nNo government after 1989 met international and national obligations - reliable sexual education or refunded contraception is still not in Poland. What has changed in recent years is consciousness, that our well-being also depends on the possibility of making autonomous decisions in the field of sexuality (the Ponton Group has great merit in this field) and the need to create the right conditions for it. For a change at the law level, we must vote for politicians and politicians who are able to talk about it openly. What each of us can do privately is to think about our own experiences related to sex education and how they affect our lives, as well as expand our knowledge based on good sources [(full story in Polish)](https://edgeryders.eu/t/dlaczego-zostalam-edukatorka-seksualna/9857)\n\n[/quote] \n\n**Before ending, let's welcome the latest community member in Wellbeing in Europe!** @Emily is a journalist working for the WDR station in Germany. She wants to work on projects combating populism and sees the best potential in collaborative problem solving and communities like Edgeryders: **'I believe that this combination of problem-solving, contact and network nurturing among each other is the best \"medicine\" against populism.'** Well done Emily for introducing yourself, and hoping others who are around will also tell their personal experiences!  \n\n## **A reminder to all, we are looking for stories of wellbeing in health, work, and morality/ spirituality.

Develop a thorough understanding of our objectives and together with the directors, identify key groups and individuals to engage via social media. *An example of a clearly defined target group is decision makers within the European Commission relevant to our current EC funded projects. Another example is people concerned about spiritual and moral development in the wake of the recent Catholic church scandals in Poland.*\n2. Do research on the target groups/list of individuals to design a communication and content strategy to reach and engage them via online channels.\n3. Discuss and finalise the metrics, strategy and timeline of activities (campaigns) for the next 3 months with the Outreach team &amp; community management team.\n4. Familiarise yourself with Edgeryders digital channels, tools, platform content, and audiovisual assets. Propose strategy for effectively making use of them to meet our objectives, or supplementing them where required.\n5. Design, execute and maintain a way to engage members of the edgeryders community to act as multiplicators. *How: by working with the outreach director, community management team to design incentives and campaigns for members to share content from the edgeryders platform via their individual social media channels on a regular basis.*\n\n**Every week**\n\n1. Participate in a biweekly virtual chat with the outreach director and community managers.\n2. Compile a list of landing pages to drive account creation and publishing of posts and comments on the [edgeryders.eu](http://edgeryders.eu/) platform. How: Select content from the Weekly community summaries posted in English, Polish, Czech, German sub-forums. Refine the copy, visuals and URLs of existing pages where needed (e.g posts created by users and or community managers). This includes verifying non-English language content with language community managers to make sure it\u2019s accurate &amp; appropriate.\n3. Create promotion materials for specific topic themes, articles and discussions posted on the [edgeryders.eu](http://edgeryders.eu) platform : this includes\n4. Create and disseminate effective social media updates to drive traffic to the landing pages on the list. *How: create social media, flyers, tweets, videos etc to draw people in to list of landing pages. You will get a budget for sourcing third party services e.g design or copywriting - NB: each expenditure have to be approved a priori in writing by the outreach director.*\n5. Create, source and curate appropriate content for our social media channels to raise their perceived value as sources of interesting &amp; relevant content for our target groups. *How: Devise and execute a campaign to get people to forward us interesting, high quality content they come across on social media.*\n6. Create lists of campaign- relevant social media accounts for individuals who can act as multiplicators for outreach campaign content including calls for participation, promotion of articles etc. *How: Find out topics that are trending in the different target countries and groups. Work with the community managers to create status updates connecting the content we are promoting with the trending topics. Find a time efficient way to reach people discussing the topics with the status update and URL to the landing page. A suggestion: do this by attending the biweekly online team meetings and community virtual cafes.*\n7. Create general interest status update and post them on the general community forum (Campfire) to drive interest from individuals already signed up on the edgeryders platform but not currently active on it.\n8. Create topic specific status updates to drive interest from people who have signed up on a subforum on the platform but are currently not active on it and send it out via group messaging. *How: Compile and maintain up-to-date /list based on forum signups - 1 list per focus nationality - details to be discussed with the respective community managers and our technology director.*\n9. Create and optimise one monthly newsletter for the edgeryders company to draw business leads from current, prospective, and past clients/funders. Promote it via the appropriate channels. *How: Work with the edgeryders management team to create appropriate materials and social media ads/campaigns to generate business interest for edgeryders competences, products, services, events, trainings and projects.*\n\n**Your reporting deliverables**\n\n* Bi-Weekly report posted on [edgeryders.eu](http://edgeryders.eu): social media + edgeryders platform analytics + newsletter performance. Focus on engagement rates and conversions into forum signups, and ways to improve them. Can we track engagement-as-clicks on social media into signups on edgeryders?

For further details see https://en.creativebureaucracy.net (Check out the short video and see the complete list of partners). This festival, first of its kind, was inspired by the work of Charles Landry and various innovators from all levels of the public sector, with the intention of creating an annual meeting point to encourage the exchange of ideas and experience between pioneers and innovators from public administrations globally. The 2018 edition of the Creative Bureaucracy Festival attracted 1200 participants from public bodies at national, regional, municipal and international levels from 21 countries, featured 165 speakers, and included topics varying from sustainability, IT and digitalisation, labour and employment, leadership and management, urban transformation and development to culture, security, education, healthcare, justice and legislation, with over 100 hours of programme taking place on 9 different stages. More than 400 young talent participants (under the age of 30) were attracted, and events included workshops, discussions, awards, parties, and a very popular \"Fuck Up Night' (featuring personal testimonials about the biggest bureaucratic 'fuckups'.  The Berlin event has inspired other cities to organise similar festivals, and these are now being planned in `Brussels, Bergen, Amsterdam, Adelaide and Athens.\nI attended a meeting in Bergen at the invitation of the key stakeholders of the Berlin Creative Bureaucracy Festival, including the publisher of Der Tagesspiegel, the main initiator and sponsor, Charles Landry, and others, and was impressed by the commitment and ambition to extend the festival in 2019. I spoke about the proposal developed with UNDP for a Bureaucrat Hackers Fellowships, the UNDP Accelerator Innovation Labs, and my own ideas about creative approaches in the public sector, and how to empower and encourage those bureaucrats and civil servants working at all levels of public administrations.  I know there are several people in the Edgeryders community already engaged in such work (and one, Caroline Paulick-Thiel from Politics for Tomorrow, Germany was at the meeting in Bergen).\nEdgeryders has now been invited to curate a programme strand for the next Creative Bureaucracy Festival to be held in Berlin 20-22 September 2019. This could take the form of a workshop or panel discussion to share Edgeryders approaches, tools and experience; we could partner with UNDP to develop further the idea of Bureaucracy Hackers Fellowships and use this as a platform to interest potential donors and sponsors (including those already supporting the festival and the large number of Government Innovation Agencies and other networks who will be represented); we might feature individual case studies and work of the Edgeryders community. We would have complete freedom to develop this programme, and would be given the necessary facilities to help achieve this, along with significant marketing/advertising support from the festival organisers. \nWould this be of value to Edgeryders? Who in Edgeryders might wish to get involved?\nIs a joint UNDP/Edgeryders approach a good idea? Could the Berlin event be another launch pad to promote Edgeryders' interest in working more closely on public sector projects with municipalities, national governments and international agencies? Who do we know working at any level of public administration (in any country) who is doing pioneering work and who might be featured as a speaker or given an award during the festival (whether or not connected to the Edgeryders community)?\nWe would need to develop an initial proposal by July.

The festival, as well as other related initiatives like Apolitical, are probably sold on the idea of rewarding public sector innovators. Showcasing examples might not get maximum impact. What we have going uniquely is the network approach.

This has been raising eyebrows in some circles, especially in culture where precarity is the rule and prosperity seems to be bourgeois. Maybe I'm wrong, but at times I've wondered if going for prosperity can make you look like impostors.\nEnd of philantropy and more impact investments, developing more entrepreneurial thinking, new kind of NGO leadership.., I guess these fall into what I mean when I say going for prosperity. \n\nThis podcast produced by @CWD  might interest you.

At the end of the month I will leave my position as Head of Media Developmenta at [Sourcefabric](https://www.sourcefabric.org/)  and will have some time to deep dive into an interesting project. \n\nI am still thinking about how to frame the topic I would like to work with in relation to this call, and I will share a few thoughts with you now, and I hope you could give me some pointers in the comments, as to what direction would be interesting to follow. I could imagine to work around a rather broad topic, such as \"**collaboration**\", with sub categories like; \n\n**Technical challanges**\nHow does collaboration look like in a distributed peer to peer network? What technical challenges are there to be solved? What initiatives are working towards solutions and how far are they? Are solutions compatible? How energy efficient are they? How private, and how hackable?\n\nLately I have been in touch with [worldbrain](https://worldbrain.io/) a privacy focused browser extension to annotate, search and organize what you've seen online. I had some interesting conversations with them about the challenges you face when working collaboratively in a distributed network, and found it a very exiting topic. \n\n\n**Open data collection**\nWhat data is collected, and what is deliberately not collected, is a very political topic. \nI am interested to talk to initiatives that have been collecting open data collaboratively, such as [safecast](https://blog.safecast.org/), who maintains the largest open data set of background radiation measurements ever collected. The organisation maps open data connected to the environment and (radioactivity, airquality) and was founded as a reaction to the lack of information on radiation after the Fukushima disaster. I would like to find out more about what blockers and what strengths they experienced in setting up the organisation, as well as their ideas on how this kind of data will be accessed in the future. \n\nWith the rise of the climate change, collecting data, especially around environmental issues, will become increasingly subversive, and will need to be both transparent and protected in safe structures.

So, having a lot of hackers in the community, one of the better programmers figured out how to allow someone to remove their own comments.  Not the sysop - only the poster could do it.

It didn't happen much so wasn't all that bothersome, and many users felt better about at least having that ability.\n\nBut then it got taken a step further when someone figured out how to \"mass scribble\" which means removing every comment you have ever made. So when you leave you take it all with you.  The statement said \"own\" and to many, that is what the word means.\n\nAgain, it wasn't too big of a problem until one guy, one of the very most prolific commenters, who said things all over the place, got in an ugly fight with his fiance' who was also very prominent on the WELL, and in a huff he did a mass scribble.

I am an old-timer here on Edgeryders. \n\nI walked that path myself, back in the 2000s. I was fortunate enough to be put in charge of several first-generation open government projects ([blog in English](http://www.cottica.net/category/cat-opengov-en/)), so I had some opportunities to experiment. I also collected my reflections into [a book](http://www.cottica.net/wikicrazia/). \n\nNowadays I am much less involved in that scene. There is still good work to be done, but I have become pessimistic on the chances of system-level reform from within. I guess I went to deep into complex systems science, with its luggage of emergence and resistance to external pressure. My latest, and probably last, contribution to high-level thinking about government is called [The Black Briefing](http://www.cottica.net/2018/03/01/the-black-briefing-why-well-intentioned-policies-fail-so-often-and-what-you-can-do-about-it/). It proposes that government is just another agent, subject to evolutionary pressure to survive and grow. This pressure *systematically* steers government in the direction of superimposing standards onto the full complexity of society and the economy. If done with sufficient power, this will result in overwriting society with standards, in a social equivalent of monoculture. Complexity breaks down, and consequences can be dire. \n\nIn this perspective, I am quite wary of deploying the metaphor of a commercial service for democracy, like in \"user-centric democracy\". It makes complete sense that, say, a restaurant service be user-centric, trying to make it easy for the client to order and consume food. Why, after all, saddle her with the full complexity of procuring the raw materials for her meal, preparing it, keeping the kitchen clean and so on? The information about that is contained in the meal's price. With democracy, I am not sure the metaphor holds. A voter that thinks she should be spared the intricacies of policy might be an unwary one, believing, for example, that disentangling a national legal and economic system from something as deep and broad as the European Union is a simple matter of cutting a Gordian knot. \n\nHow do you see the matter? How does it map onto infrastructure and policy for the Internet?", "created_at": "2019-05-24 14:48:45.047761", "updated_at": "2019-05-24 14:48:45.047761", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 404, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 103.8, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [53925], "is_reply_to": [53925], "is_liked_by": [5132, 4022, 1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 53934, "user_id": 5132, "topic_id": 9980, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Thanks @alberto. Thanks for sharing your blog post, I'll definitely take a look. I suppose there's a couple of points I've considered to your comments. To your point of the metaphor of commercial services and the idea of \"user-centric\" government. This is a principle I've actually seen being applied, for real, within digital services. This is partly why, for so long I've been interested in how citizens can become more enable to participate in an iterative democratic process. I suppose the deeper question to answer becomes \"how much government should a citizen be exposed to?\" My view has always been that the current democratic settlement is too abstract, too representative and fails to empower either the individual, the community, or the society. Thus, the impact of relatively rare referendums and elections aren't correlated to the individual's viewpoints and actions.\n\nIndeed, to your EU point - how do citizens understand the wider implications of such questions, rather than outsourcing such decisions to a political class no better equipped to answer the question than the electorate that it supposedly serves.\n\nI've seen with my own eyes the impact of effective, government, user-centric design and am curious to see how this might escape the confines of a Civil Service, to make its way into higher level decision making by way of a network effect that might enable more thorough and deeper decision-making. The side effect, in a changing world might also be more stable government with active, rather than passive contribution from citizens.\n\nOf course, I'd be failing my own argument if I didn't acknowledge that this would require, testing, iteration and learning and that failure is definitely an option!", "created_at": "2019-05-24 15:18:13.582693", "updated_at": "2019-05-24 15:18:13.582693", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 289, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 68.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [53930], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 54288, "user_id": 5158, "topic_id": 9980, "post_number": 7, "raw": "I broadly agree with @ChrisR that the democratic systems we have in place are generally broken, or rather, less effective than they could be if they were to be rethought using human-centric design principles.

Whilst closely studying emerging government strategies  I noticed there was little in the way of GDS type ambitions (the human centric approach) within the plans for our society.  In fact the main thread throughout the likes of the UK\u2019s Industrial and Digital strategies are based on widening the doors to large corporate support and, reading between the lines, approving their capitalist control and influence in exchange.  The Government\u2019s contribution in all this is to sponsor large programmes of infrastructure development (yet more capitalist gain) and to provide economic incentives in order to create the perfect environment for global industries to make their home in the UK. \n\nChris, if you're interested in exploring what democracy looks like for a nation based on rethinking using a service design process that you're familiar with then I think we could set something up.  I think it plays well into the topic of Internet of Humans, we could possibly run some design sprints and build up a \"discovery\" to present at a track in November.  Maybe the festival will include prototyping and broadening of the discussion.", "created_at": "2019-05-31 07:47:21.799035", "updated_at": "2019-05-31 07:47:21.799035", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 457, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 92.6, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 2, "quotes_posts": [53930, 53934], "is_reply_to": [53930, 53934], "is_liked_by": [1856, 5132, 2915, 3, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 53998, "user_id": 5135, "topic_id": 10007, "post_number": 1, "raw": "You wake up in cuba, have your morning coffee, and you need to send an email. There is no wifi in your house. You take your computer and walk to the nearest park. There a young man is standing on the corner offering small green cards. On them is a wifi name and the password to access it. All around you on every bench and corner sit young couples on their smartphones, older college students working on papers, and mothers watching children play. It is here, outside, among the screams of children and the general buzz of people that you can log on. This park is where the internet lives.\n\nEven this small shift of place, from ubiquity to locality subverts an assumption we all make about about the most important interface of the modern world.. In this internet, via this infrastructure, what does it mean to be online? It is fair to wonder if even this small shift would allow for certain forms we take for granted in our ubiquitous and isolated internet. It is fair to wonder, for example, if the sort of anonymous hate much of the western internet has been inundated by could even exist. Still, this is only a shift of one factor, out of isolation and into the communal. Once online the computer is still built for isolated use, the log in still for one person. What we are given here is not a resolution but a hint at the possible.\n\nScattered across the world there are other shifts and other hints. There have been documented cases of entire families using a single facebook profile. There are stands at public markets for thumb drives of &quot;content&quot; in areas where censorship is heavy. If we hold back our attempts at &quot;why&quot; these systems exist and take a moment to simply appreciate that they exist we can follow their existence to the simple conclusion. Isolated and ubiquitous internets are just a choice.\n\nWhat if we're doing it wrong? By we I mean the colonial sense, as in western civilization and western culture. By it I mean the internet. Specifically the sort of access we build its infrastructure to facilitate. There is a prevailing sense that the internet, like water, should have an infrastructure that allows for simple and uninterrupted, ubiquitous, access. At its base this sentiment is a noble one. Like water and education the internet should be accessible by every human on the planet, and this access should be easily had. However, the more one looks the more one finds flaws in, or at the very least other ways of approaching, the concept that the access should be everywhere all the time.\n\nWith that in mind, why on earth should wifi be ubiquitous? The prevailing colonial western logic establishes the following basic premise: Because it is good and when something is good it should be everywhere all the time. If you're not american and this seems foreign or confusing to you then consult the Mcdonald's Logic: People like burgers, so people should have constant and immediate access to burgers. This stems from the also very american sense that conflates objects with freedom and freedom with democracy. It works like this, In america freedom has no real definition but it is unanimously agreed upon that whatever it is is good and that everyone should have it everywhere. All of this is derivative of the founding ethos, &quot;Democracy is good, democracy should be everywhere all the time.&quot;\n\nThe final and parent logic I find to be true. It's derivative statements less and less so with every consecutive leap down the family tree. So the question we come to explore is about the statement, &quot;The internet is good, and so it should be everywhere all the time.&quot;\n\nIs the internet good? We can address that quickly, it is not. That doesn't mean the internet is &quot;bad.&quot; We're just asking the wrong question. The internet is a technology. Technology builds tools. It is immensely weird to point to something like that and blurt out &quot;controlled combustion is good,&quot; because its not. Controlled combustion is not inherently good. It is good at building particular sorts of things. But, perhaps we mean the things it builds are good. So our question becomes, &quot;The things the Internet builds are good.&quot; Again, no they aren't. It follows from essentially the same reason as above. A tool is not good. A tool is good for certain tasks. Controlled combustion is good at building guns. Guns are not good--they aren't bad either. Guns are good for abruptly ending somethings life. The same is true of internal combustion engines, they aren't good, they are good for building machines that move fast or lift heavy or, coincidentally, end somethings life very abruptly. A technology is good at something. A tool is good for something. Conversely, they are very bad at other things and they are very bad for other things. So no, the internet is not &quot;good&quot;.\n\n&quot;...and so it should be everywhere all the time.&quot;\n\nHere a definition in isolation no longer works. We're talking about integration and interaction at a massive scale. This is about industry and culture and environment and, as a result, politics. So often we address this by simply saying, &quot;The internet should be everywhere because it promotes freedom.&quot;\n\nIf you don&rsquo;t want to read the rest of this section then it will serve you just refer to the previous mentioning of the american definition--or lack thereof-- of freedom and to wonder to yourself &quot;Is it a good idea to write policy and build infrastructure based off some ill defined and simple sentences that, owing to their lack of definition, mean at once so much and so little.&quot; You could also skip that and just read the news. There are a series of much discussed points refuting that the internet promotes freedom, some of the best being those outlined in the Ukrainian net theorist Evgeny Morozov's book &quot;The Net Delusion.&quot; In the next short section I will briefly outline these points for those without better things to do. If you already believe me than skip down to the paragraph that begins &quot;do not be afraid.&quot;\n\nThe internet is just as useful for anti-democratic regimes and generally &quot;anti-freedom&quot; dictators as it is for those groups americans selectively deem &quot;freedom fighters&quot;. In some cases much more so. A fantastic example of this is the much publicized roll of the internet via microblogging sites twitter and facebook in the protests and subsequent revolutions that were the Arab Spring and Euromaiden. At the time and still to this day is a story is often repeated in which the internet had a pivotal role in the incepting and directing of those moments. Tahir and Independence Square were said to be hotbeds of twitter activity in which tech savvy freedom fighters typed away, organizing brilliant and seemingly instant fronts that, just in time, would mass and disappear like so many white blood cells attacking the disease of fascism. This is a good story. The women and men who made up these movements were unspeakably brave and I do them no justice here. However, that particular story, of the sort of role that the internet played in these movements, turns out to be not exactly true.\n\nWhen the actual posts surrounding these events were looked at more closely it became clear that while not entirely false, the role of the internet in the organization and mobilization of people was greatly exaggerated. The internet was certainly used, but not in the way the western(or eastern for that matter) media told the story. Rather than say &quot;look how good the internet is as a tool for freedom&quot; we begin to ask &quot;how useful was the internet as a tool in these movements?&quot; and then to the better question &quot;was the internet as useful to the protestors(freedom) as it was to the government's(fascism)?&quot; This evolution is important for us because it moves us very far away from the original ill defined premise and closer to the actual issue. Years later, Looking now at those movements and their eventual repercussions, no less at the internet's role in those repercussions, we are further pushed to question our ethos surrounding the internets sainthood, and much more seriously, the forms we choose to physically manifest it in. Further, if the internet's use in expanding so called freedoms is questionable, then it's ability to diminish them is concrete fact. Dictatorships can use and have used the internet for reliably identifying and locating political dissidents en masse, selectively censoring public discourse in real time, creating swarms of trolls that intimidate voices and obfuscate fact, and a very long list of other both evil and rather ingenious tools built from this technology.\n\nDo not be afraid. I raise these issues not in hopes of prohibition or to engender fear in any way. The internet does much good. I do it simply to call into question--not to repudiate--the architecture of a political system in its fullest sense. I mean the complex and human made system that links belief and idea to industry, culture, society, finance, and policy. The structure of which that little idea above sits within as a pivot stone. There have been many essays and books and movies which highlight both the good and objectively evil of the internet and I do not wish to spend anymore time focused on it. If you're unconvinced or curious Mr. Morozov has 400 pages of argument for you. I am not offended if you stop reading this and go jump into that. But the morality of the internet is too philosophical a discussion for my taste. This is not what I wish to talk to you about. I have focused on it simply because with an idea it is enough to find one simple flaw, among much perfection or many other flaws just like it, in order to do irreparable harm to the blind acceptance of that idea. And it is irreparable harm I wish to do and hope I have done.\n\nIn short, it turns out that the morality of the internet, like the morality of any technology is nothing but the sum of a tool and the instant of its implementation. Even this is determined only by the particular window from which we saw a particular hand fire a particular gun at a particular being for an unknown but certainly very particular reason. In a word, it's difficult. And that is all we need to know for now.\n\nI will now take a moment after that particularly long, though I hope not too boring, enumeration of issues with a premise to remind the reader that this is about place. We are asking whether or not the internet should be everywhere. This is a matter of place because everywhere is all of them. Wonderfully, we are not in terra incognita talking about how we build technology into tool and tools into place. This discussion is in many ways at the heart of the story of human civilization. Every time we push the boundary of the real we have had to find some form for it to take and some way for it to be used and subsequently understood. It must have somewhere to be. Looking over our shoulder this way it may seem that while to be human is to love and think and create, to be &quot;humanity&quot;--at once singularly it and plurally apart of it--is to find a place for the things we love, think of, and create.\n\nWe place them so well that too often we mistake what is for what should be, what has been, and what will be. We tend to see the current manifestations of technology as part of some inevitable construct. But, history is not a straight line. Nothing made by human hand from human mind is a part of anything beyond the history that shaped the culture that raised the mind that used the hand to build the thing(hagadyah). The tools we make and the infrastructures we build around them are both simply artifacts. There is no absolute principle or universal truth that they manifest. Things can be made differently. Infrastructure can take different shapes. The permutations are likely infinite. Simply put, things can be radically different.\n\n&quot;...alone everywhere&quot;\n\nOften in our western imaganings we view time spent on the internet as anti-social. The image comes to mind of a pale man in a dark room illuminated only by the blue glow of his computer. I imagine all of us have seen this picture or can at least imagine it all too easily. But if we are to question it I believe we would find three pivots.\n\n(1) why is he white?\n\n(2) why is he a he?\n\n(3) why is he alone?\n\nThe first two have simple, though consistently ignored answers.\n\n(1) systems of white supremacy in our culture that paint all protagonists as white.\n\n(2) patriarchal systems in our culture that paint all protagonists as men.\n\nthose systems were built, are not inevitable, and deserve to be radically altered. I won't dedicate much time to them here not because they aren't important but because the third leads us somewhere I'd like to go with you. It's answer too can be stated simply.\n\n(3)Because we built the interfaces of the internet to emphasis a physical isolation.\n\nComputers, hand-held or otherwise, have been built with one screen and one keyboard. The digital interfaces via which we log on are singular, the profiles we build personal. The interfaces via which we utilize the internet are absolutely exclusionary. It is important the we remember it does not have to be this way just because it currently is this way. Further, as we build the internet to be everywhere, if we accept that the physical objects and built interfaces via which we utilize the internet are isolated and emphasise an exclusion then everywhere we access it we are physically isolating ourselves. We are emphasizing an exclusion.\n\nThis is an effect of the current technological institution in the western white world. There are already alternate forms of access that turn these assumptions on their head. Imagine an internet that is outdoors and entirely communal. Imagine an internet which emphasises public life and community, the opposite of the isolated, indoor, private interfaces via which we currently interact. You do not have to simply imagine.

However, information infrastructures are often as difficult to conceive as they are to perceive; they are both enormously complex and relatively invisible. This is both necessary and by design, but it does make examining and explaining the working of information infrastructure technologies rather difficult. As information infrastructures become less visible and more complex, two things can be assured; that there will be more in need of explanation, and less available to examine.\n\nThe purpose of this project is to examine what role the invisibility and complexity of information technology infrastructures plays in a user's relation towards said systems. I argue that, within the context of human relations towards systems that resist aspection or comprehension, human methods of dealing with such systems constitute techne, or a craft. I further argue that the craft of dealing with occulted systems of non-anthropic scale and complexity is endemic to forms of information infrastructure other than the technical. I illustrate this point through examination of contemporary and traditional crafts that have historically dealt with complex and occulted systems, particularly those that are categorized as witchcraft or magic. Through this example I argue that magical practices are analogous to technical practices in regards to human relations towards the complex and hidden in information infrastructures.\n\nUsing distant reading methods I argue that this concordance is a generalizable phenomena not limited to the populations directly observed, and demonstrate that a discourse on hidden and complex infrastructural systems is present within both the magical and technical literature. I theorize that, as the relative hiddeness and complexity of information infrastructures increases, the presence of and need for craftwork to it manage also increases. Our current information infrastructure environment is not fully agential. It is, however, responsive, predictive, and surveillant. Magic's depiction of complex and hidden infrastructures and their relation towards the anthropic always already inflects and may yet inform our incipient relations towards the burgeoning and increasingly agential forces of technical information infrastructures.\n\nThe narrative of the project is as follows. I have surveyed one hundred and twenty students in the field of information studies. These students do not know how many of their technologies work, particularly information infrastructure technologies. They are aware of this lack of knowledge, but that does not stop them from forming relations to these systems. They use a variety of metaphors and creative conceptions to describe how they imagine that these systems work. While these depictions may not be factually accurate, and the students are aware of their factual inaccuracy, these creative depictions still inform the students' relations towards these information infrastructures. Not all technologies are treated equally; there is a continuum. A hammer, for instance, requires no imaginative facility to explain; its functioning is both simple and visible. As technologies become less visible, their functioning is less evident, and requires more explanation. Similarly, as a technology becomes more complex it likewise becomes less explicable (and often seemingly agential). In instances wherein students described their relation towards particularly complex and hidden infrastructures, they often characterized these relations with reference to the concept of 'magic'. It is important to point out that these students do not think that technology is magic, but rather assert that it is practical to treat it as if it were magic. This invocation of the term magic is not an abrogation of rationality, but a description of their own relative, perspectival relation towards the phenomena in question. What does it mean to treat an information technology and its adjacent infrastructure as if it were magic? What does a magical relation towards complex and hidden systems entail, and how can our understanding of such relations inform the ways in which we use and relate to information infrastructures generally? In order to answer these questions we turn to examine magical practitioners and their crafts, with the intention of better understanding what it means to have a magical relation towards information infrastructures.\n\nI have interviewed sixteen magical practitioners for this project. Students often described their relation towards technology in terms of magic; similarly, magic users often described their relation towards magic in terms of technology. What, however, is magic a technology for? Using the interviews as evidence, I argue that magic is primarily a technology that for dealing with, managing, and maintaining occult and possibly agential infrastructures that provide some service, or undergird some essential activity. Whether or not these infrastructures actually exist is of no consequence; what matters is that tools for their management do.One possible avenue through which to illustrate this connection between the magical relations of the students and the magical relations of the magic practitioners is to take a look at all of the similarities in practice, all of the good, practical advice relating to occult and possibly agential systems, and point out that these are all very similar to the sort of 'non-rational' responses from many of the students. The intent here is to point out that our non-rational approaches towards information infrastructures and their adjacent technologies do not arise de novo; instead, it is a mainstreaming of many of the warnings and precepts always already in traditional and contemporary magic practice. Our seemingly novel approaches towards and relationships to these complex and hidden systems technical information infrastructures are outgrowths of of centuries of work on dealing with just such phenomena by magical practitioners. This is also intended to demonstrate how, in relation towards complex and invisible systems, humans tend to do the same sorts of things, and enact the same sorts of relations, regardless of whether we are talking about Siri or Faerie. While magic and science are often painted as being at odds, they may be framed as complementary. Science is the art of explaining the measurable, while magic is the art of dealing with the unknown. We need arts of dealing with the unknown now, and we will need them more and more as infrastructural systems expand in relative scale and as such diminish in relative visibility.\n\nIt is natural and necessary for information infrastructures to be complex and hidden, but we need to be aware of how such occultation can inform and inflect human/infrastructural relations. The problem now is not that infrastructures are occulted by being hidden, in the sense that wires run in the wall or Wi-Fi works on an invisible spectrum. Rather, it is that infrastructures are becoming occult in scale; that is to say, they operate at non-anthropic scales, and are not amenable to anthropic aspection, comprehension, or analysis; at least not in a holistic fashion. Magic is an attempt to understand the management of systems, without necessarily understanding the system itself. In this sense we are all magicians, increasingly so.", "created_at": "2019-05-28 00:18:14.395900", "updated_at": "2019-07-01 17:46:49.191555", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1145, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 78.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5108, 2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 55114, "user_id": 5188, "topic_id": 10017, "post_number": 17, "raw": "Edit - FB just got dropped from an investment list of \"socially responsible companies\"......\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/13/facebook-dumped-from-sp-esg-index-of-socially-responsible-companies.html\nRemember, FB didn't really come into being to become what it became!

I  think that a possible route to address them is  an ecumenical way of performing and understanding faith in relation to morality (although for many people morality does not necessarily depend upon religious/spiritual faith).  This  perspective might foster empathy, compassion, and above all reciprocity. In light of this civic and political philosophy of reciprocity the mutual exchange between those who belong to different religious traditions can foster spiritual well being. At the end of the day, &quot;religion&quot; has done little to prevent unhappiness, metaphysical loneliness, violence and social, political, economic and epistemic injustice (see http://churchandstate.org.uk/.../religion-has-done.../...). This political philosophy of reciprocity is doubled, I assume, by a &quot;new comparative theology&quot; that is not easily embraced by everyone. It seems that what Christians lack is embracing other religious traditions (though not only Christians). I fond this short article illuminating in this regard: https://publicorthodoxy.org/.../orthodoxy-and-new.../. The main idea is that &quot;the \u201cnew comparative theology,\u201d as it has been christened, is a confessional theology seeking to explore the meaning of one\u2019s own religious tradition by critical investigation of another or aspects of another. While it utilizes the most sophisticated knowledge of such traditions, it is not a disinterested endeavor where the comparer seeks to bracket the truth claims of her own religious worldview. Rather, this work is done faithfully, moving beyond one\u2019s own tradition, asking questions of the religious other\u2019s texts or practices, seeking correlations and novel insights, then returning to examine what has been discovered in the process...&quot; In a nutshell: To what extent religious pluralism enhances a concept of God that embraces &quot;all people&quot; (irrespective of their religious tradition)? Can this concept of God help us make better sense of the \u201cnew moral codes\u201d adapted to contemporary needs and concerns?", "created_at": "2019-06-26 07:26:08.270095", "updated_at": "2019-06-26 07:26:08.270095", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 315, "wiki": false, "reads": 23, "score": 39.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 56057, "user_id": 4773, "topic_id": 10030, "post_number": 14, "raw": "@ jasen_lakic I agree with you that spirituality and religion are distinct things and the terms as such should not be conflated. I also agree that in the current climate of pervasive economic, social and epistemic injustice churches (institutionalized religions) do not do much to restore the trust in the universal moral values of love, compassion and so on. What I have noticed -mostly in Central and South Eastern Europe, but also in the West -  is that religious institutions and their commitments have a decreasing social significance whereas their political significance has increased (at least in some Central and East European countries). We have to also keep in mind that nationalisms (sometimes viewed as a secularized religion) also play a substantial role in fostering epistemic and moral values only for the in-groups, excluding \"the others.\" You said that \"Spirituality and religion should be separated from the church.\" I fully agree that while churches need to work on their credibility as \"God's houses,\" the interest in non-institutional forms of religious practice and spirituality grows. I am only not sure whether family and immediate surroundings can always nurture the set of values that focus on reciprocity, love, compassion .....I am not saying that this is never the case but in some contexts one \"cannot be prophet in his own land\" :wink:", "created_at": "2019-07-02 10:03:32.640931", "updated_at": "2019-07-02 10:04:52.474859", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 221, "wiki": false, "reads": 21, "score": 14.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [55874], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60776, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 10030, "post_number": 16, "raw": "3 posts were merged into an existing topic: [Coding Call](/t/coding-call/10814/20)", "created_at": "2019-10-06 20:38:45.190905", "updated_at": "2019-10-06 20:38:45.353539", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 15, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 2.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 54213, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 10031, "post_number": 4, "raw": "I'm - unfortunately - based in Tbilisi, Georgia (unless you're planning one there ;) ).

I won't be in London sadly.  Your debate is an interesting one and certainly starts to address the trend in innovation that is attractive to our governments and large corporate organisations, the risks such as the one Inge points out have catastrophic implications. \n\nFrom your link \"We are experiencing the last potential zone of transition with humans in full control and planning agency.\" - I'm under the impression that's it's more the capitalist machinery now that's in full control and removing the human element from that is inevitable.  I think I've tried to influence from within which is what I think you are working with too and for me I've been repeatedly crushed.  I wonder if there is another way?\n\nI've mentioned in [another post](https://edgeryders.eu/t/humanity-has-two-existential-threats-our-disregard-for-the-environment-and-our-disregard-for-eath-other/10041) what I feel are the real issues we face and I'm not sure how these innovations solve them.  \n\n[quote=\"RobvanKranenburg, post:15, topic:10031\"]\nOfcourse if I had a button I would stop all of this technology now, I would push it.\n[/quote]\n\nThis is more for what I stand for.  But it's not realistic at the moment, the only time we will stop at scale is when there is incentive (through force | desire) to do so.  If we wait for top-down direction based on the \u201ctheir\u201d opinion of \u201cwhen we have to do it\u201d it will be far too late and any solution thereafter is likely to be the wrong one driven by the wrong values, and fear. But maybe we can tap into the desire to do so, bottom-up.\n\nThe Armish for example live simple lives and in contrast to popluar belief with technology.  They ride in horse and carriage because all of them can do so equally, they use electricity because it is a utility accessible to all of them, they do not have tractors because their neighbour could buy a bigger tractor and competition would enter their community.  Each new technology available to them is considered and either integrated or rejected.  Their value systems are different to the majority of the western world and they know how to \"stop\" or rather not even start.   I believe we need to have something similar, a set of values and standards to refer to when considering if we _need_ 5G and smart sensors, etc, the real impact on humanity and if we need them the controls and constraints around them for their purpose. Though I have be mistaken for a Luddite I really am not, I simply call for a more cognitive decision making process based on human-centric needs when considering whether we \"should\" rather than whether we \"could\".\n\n[quote=\"RobvanKranenburg, post:15, topic:10031\"]\nMy interest lies in building a stable political zone of human machine complimentarity, supporting humans in what they do best: ultimately Nietzsche\u2019s love and shame and for #IoT full resource management as our only chance against Climate Change.\n[/quote]\n\nI appreciate the mention of Nietzsche.  I fully back a need to manage resources more carefully.  A project I set up a few years ago which I need to restart aims at[inspiring the next generation of ecologically aware creative technologists](http://www.adventurelabs.co.uk/2017/11/27/a-mission-working-towards-2050/) to do just that in ways we haven't yet thought of.   \n\nIt feels like we are concerned and challenging the same issues from slightly different standpoints.  I'm currently trying to avoid London atm, I'm living out in the hills of the Peak District as part of my effort to decentralise and also focus on the natural environment around me.  \n\nI'd would like to meet up (remotely or in person, maybe in Georgia if we could fund the travel) at some stage to consider our current positions and how they might compliment each other in a simplified and unified approach. Maybe @inge  would be interested in that conversation too and maybe it is something to consider for the festival.  I think one of our tasks would be to simplify the heuristics and collaborate on an accessible concept derived from our collective concerns, understandings and approaches - though it may also turn out that we have a need to continue our different approaches.\n\nWould there be interest in this from others?", "created_at": "2019-05-31 09:48:56.838803", "updated_at": "2019-05-31 09:48:56.838803", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 746, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 32.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [54286], "is_reply_to": [54286, 54290], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 54210, "user_id": 4868, "topic_id": 10033, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Join me in Aarhus at IoT Week.\n\nhttps://sites.grenadine.co/sites/iot/en/aarhus-2019/schedule/3500/Discussing%20Next%20Generation%20Internet%20Technology%20and%20Policy%20Workshop\n\nHow can we ensure not making the same mistakes as with the (failed) smart city (applications), but co-create services in the vertical applications (body/health, home/energy, car/sharing, region/collective intelligence) with all stakeholders including citizens? In this workshop we want to investigate the procedure of embedding these ideas and requirements in a Digital Signature for the Infrastructure. \n\nThis has the important bonus it no longer matters who hosts the data and which platforms it runs, as the liability, accountability, procurement, GDPR and Cybersecurity Act compliance is in situational contracts (term Christian Nold), thus ensuring the new insights (fostering new services) stay well known to all stakeholders. In earlier workshops of NGI Forward WP3 the realization was made that in these 5G environments all entities (whether persons, goods, objects or situations) will be given federated and temporary identities, as in the case of an accident with the connected car in which all \u2018stakeholders\u2019 (the car, the person, the lantern pole that is hit, the water that the crashes into that is polluted\u2026) receive temporary identities the ensemble of which becomes the \u2018virtual accident\u2019 the liability and accountability is administered on. \n\nCurrently eIDas is the digital signature for persons, GS1 is providing product codes (\u2018passports\u2019) for goods and coelition.org is mapping and numbering everyday activities. In these environments AI will run in the network and robotic capabilities are built in to function semi-autonomously, the agency to name the combinations of the temporary and federated (attribute-based) identities will be vital to creating new services. Currently this agency is in the hands of GAFA and BAT.\n\nIn the case of architectures the first Salon put forward four building blocks. The  *first*  is that in an  *Internet of Humans* , or  *Next Generation Internet* , trust can be tokenized but only within a situation of already established trust between people, meaning there has to be a social understanding before it can be technically articulated, can we talk about communities and everyday life. The  *second*  is successful anticipatory regulation: \u201cjoint-up multidisciplinary regulation through collaboration platforms on AI that include startups, think-tanks and academia, large and medium-sized companies, governments and their ethics commissions, civil society and activists.\u201dThe  *third* is to explore building institution like entities with the concepts of  *data utilities*  and the work of Neil Lawrence and Sylvie Delacroix who propose  *data trusts*  as a bottom-up mechanism whereby data-subjects choose to pool their data within the legal framework of the Trust. The  *fourth*  is to include potential third-party trust providers are seemingly neutral organizations that have a large member base organized around for example mobility (in the Netherlands the ANWB has a membership of 4.446.528 (1-1-2017).

Through an historical account of value theory and how we do national accounting, she drives home one point: value is a societal choice, and a very political one. At different points in time, the same activity was considered to produce value or not, depending on the ideology of the time. \n\nValue theory can get fairly metaphysical, and one is reminded of medieval scholars debating on how many angels can dance on a pin. With a major difference: value theory drives the world. Once we have decided something has value, then we throw the full weight of human resources and ingenuity to borrow, beg, steal or even produce it.\n\nWe might hold heterodox value theories, and many here do.
