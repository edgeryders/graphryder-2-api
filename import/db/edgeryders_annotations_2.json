Similar like Frank and Henri\nMoney or money\u2019s worth? We think of property as a thing. The development model in the UK is that you buy land, let it increase in value and sell it off. Land as a commodity. If you break down land, there are certain elements. First: rights of use (fishing, grow crops). Second: rights to fruits of use of land: who gets them. Mortgages: you\u2019re giving the banks the fruits of the use of the land. Third: right to keep somebody out, exclusion. These three rights can constitute the sharing of surplus.\nWe can easily create agreements that . If you have a piece of land and you put things into it (work, fertilizer, \u2026) and then you get stuff out of it and distribute it. The way that we have been scaling this has been through companies with shareholders. Everything is a cost for shareholders, they don\u2019t share.\nImagine a club where, if you are part of the club, you get the right to live there. It\u2019s going on in London.

It happens for the sake of community.

The idea is worth pursuing, the technology is there. First it was a technical motivation, afterwards it was clear that insulin was a social and economical issue. \n\nMany people don\u2019t have access, it\u2019s bad in the US. Only a few companies have the oligopoly on production globally (US, France, Denmark based).\n\nThere\u2019s also the fragility of the supply chains. Only major producers in the West, which means that supply is easily disrupted in less developed or accessible regions. We need to rely less on shipping insulin around and maintaining eg. a cold chain. This is a major barrier to getting insulin out where it needs to be. In short, we need to decentralise production.\n\nScience and engineering:Went through one proof of concept iteration in an E. coli bacteria (for troubleshooting methods). Took about a year. We made a precursor protein to insulin. Bacteria however is not able to convert the precursor into insulin, so since early 2017 we\u2019re looking at yeast, because that organism can do everything inside the organism. The protocol needs to be simple and easily reproduced.\n\n6 months - 1 year we will have engineered the strain that does everything. Then we can move to using the strain and producing or scaling up. So the question is now: how do we structure the legal entities to govern the production.\n\nTeams from Ghent (ReaGent) and Sydney (BioFoundry) joined the project. International collaboration is unfolding. We need to organise this better and set up some legal frameworks for sharing the IP that gets generated, keeping the goals of the project in mind, we want to have a commons framework. Allowing entities to use it, but making sure that they do so in keeping with commons principles. \n\nThe organisation needs to ultimately be accountable to diabetes patients. It can\u2019t be a misalignment like we have now with the large producers that mainly have a large profit motor. They just keep diabetics dependent, charge high prices, and don\u2019t innovate much otherwise. Prices went up by 1000%, even though production got cheaper.\n\nMany semi-independent manufacturing efforts that are localised, but sharing knowledge. A [diabetes] patient coop would be able to decide how much effort to put into prevention or researching cure vs manufacturing.\n\nThe FDA is the biggest player in making this a reality. Big part of this is making a rigorous case and showing the costs of illness and the benefits of our alternative. Depending on how their own incentives work, they might not care. \n\nWe have 2 goals, proposal is to split in two groups:\n\n1. How do we move from here to this cooperative?\n\nA cooperative as a platform where patients would be the main stakeholders.The patent is not to stop other people from doing it, but to protect the \n\nCharacteristics of the agreement:\n\nRate of profit determined by patientsWhere it is invested is determined by patients.\n\nExample of medical cannabis cooperatives. Maybe we can use it as a template for our organisation. Tailor this to the local jurisdiction. \n\nWe need some kind of global scale organisation that holds the IP in custody. Perhaps a Swiss foundation. A public benefit corporation.\n\nForging alliances with city governments. Show that production at city scale is feasible and show that economic implications they have can be addressed. Eg. problem of people going to emergency rooms, which is a cost for the city, so open source insulin would make the hospital work better.Lucas Gonzales. Epidemiologist. His job is to prepare for flu pandemics in the canary islands. As part of preparing the plan, he found out there\u2019s 8000\u2019s diabetics in the CI and there is no capacity on the island (comes from Germany). So in case of pandemic, they are screwed.

The idea is worth pursuing, the technology is there. First it was a technical motivation, afterwards it was clear that insulin was a social and economical issue. \n\nMany people don\u2019t have access, it\u2019s bad in the US. Only a few companies have the oligopoly on production globally (US, France, Denmark based).\n\nThere\u2019s also the fragility of the supply chains. Only major producers in the West, which means that supply is easily disrupted in less developed or accessible regions. We need to rely less on shipping insulin around and maintaining eg. a cold chain. This is a major barrier to getting insulin out where it needs to be. In short, we need to decentralise production.\n\nScience and engineering:Went through one proof of concept iteration in an E. coli bacteria (for troubleshooting methods). Took about a year. We made a precursor protein to insulin. Bacteria however is not able to convert the precursor into insulin, so since early 2017 we\u2019re looking at yeast, because that organism can do everything inside the organism. The protocol needs to be simple and easily reproduced.\n\n6 months - 1 year we will have engineered the strain that does everything. Then we can move to using the strain and producing or scaling up. So the question is now: how do we structure the legal entities to govern the production.\n\nTeams from Ghent (ReaGent) and Sydney (BioFoundry) joined the project. International collaboration is unfolding. We need to organise this better and set up some legal frameworks for sharing the IP that gets generated, keeping the goals of the project in mind, we want to have a commons framework. Allowing entities to use it, but making sure that they do so in keeping with commons principles. \n\nThe organisation needs to ultimately be accountable to diabetes patients. It can\u2019t be a misalignment like we have now with the large producers that mainly have a large profit motor. They just keep diabetics dependent, charge high prices, and don\u2019t innovate much otherwise. Prices went up by 1000%, even though production got cheaper.\n\nMany semi-independent manufacturing efforts that are localised, but sharing knowledge. A [diabetes] patient coop would be able to decide how much effort to put into prevention or researching cure vs manufacturing.\n\nThe FDA is the biggest player in making this a reality. Big part of this is making a rigorous case and showing the costs of illness and the benefits of our alternative. Depending on how their own incentives work, they might not care. \n\nWe have 2 goals, proposal is to split in two groups:\n\n1. How do we move from here to this cooperative?\n\nA cooperative as a platform where patients would be the main stakeholders.The patent is not to stop other people from doing it, but to protect the \n\nCharacteristics of the agreement:\n\nRate of profit determined by patientsWhere it is invested is determined by patients.\n\nExample of medical cannabis cooperatives. Maybe we can use it as a template for our organisation. Tailor this to the local jurisdiction. \n\nWe need some kind of global scale organisation that holds the IP in custody. Perhaps a Swiss foundation. A public benefit corporation.\n\nForging alliances with city governments. Show that production at city scale is feasible and show that economic implications they have can be addressed. Eg. problem of people going to emergency rooms, which is a cost for the city, so open source insulin would make the hospital work better.Lucas Gonzales. Epidemiologist. His job is to prepare for flu pandemics in the canary islands. As part of preparing the plan, he found out there\u2019s 8000\u2019s diabetics in the CI and there is no capacity on the island (comes from Germany). So in case of pandemic, they are screwed.

More than 50% of Americans can't cover the bill for an ER\n\n(Podcast skillshareLand upstate)\n\nZAD presentation:\n\nNamid, Liliana, Sara, Claire\n\nLand occupation set up to fight an airport project, in a struggle for 15 yrs. The occupation movement exists only for 8 yrs, created through a call out. 10 square km, as big as the biggest villages in France. 200-300 people who made the choice to live there. Several thousands involved. Organizing without state infrastructures. How to avoid relations of domination, hierarchy, specialization. Collective autonomy. Diversity of thoughts, but fascists not welcome. \n\nHow they organize:\n\nDaft structurescabins, farmhouses, tents. A lot of agriculture with machines, collective gardens - grain and beans to feed a nonmarket and support other struggles.\n\nThey built a lot of infrastructure: spaces for tractor mechanics, woodwork, preservation spaces. Weekly newspaper, radio, website zad.nadir.org, welcome houses, internal telecom network. No police, no justice. Conflict mediation group. Autonomous health care. Some people don't have health insurance, no legal papers, or access to cars or phone to do paperwork in the city. Fugitives, people traumatized by the medic system. \n\n4 spaces of care:\n\nLa transfuse cabin for first aid, Trailer Medic for free/cheap medical assistance, Varies Rouge medical house a collective living there similar to a hospital, Medicinal Cabin for storing and drying medicinal plants. \n\nVaries Rouges:\n\nSees 10 25 people a week, medical problems or who want a tattoo for their dog. At least 1 person available that can do care - a mix of self aid and accompanying medical surgeries - opened wounds, dog attacks, police.All materials are donated, i.e. by hospitals, medicine are free prices, tinctures are one tenth of retails, support group of professional. We're not trying to do everything or be the heroes, but there's a lot we can do. \n\nWe help people without papers to get into medical institutions, and take responsibility for it. \n\nCARE for people  caught in armed conflicts I.e. with the police in demonstrations - rubber bullet injuries, grenades. Fight the part of the state that is intentionally hurting its people. \n\nTrainings:\n\nShort, for life vital help and first aid. 9 day for people in the zed, in a certain region so afterwards they can work together in their city, for example in demonstrations.A network of people who've been through these trainings (80) so they can call out to the other groups. Easier to organize together because they have the same protocols.\n\nWe grow our own medicine in the medicinal garden and harvest them. Use them in consultations for chronic problems.Regular Drop in clinics for exchanges, training and giving care at the same time.\n\nAbout mental health:\n\nNo filter, anyone can come when they want. We're now at the step of collecting information and finding professionals support.\n\nWhy do we do this? To take control of what happens with our lives, put ourselves on a learning path. The person who has the power to decide is not the same as the person who has the knowledge about their body.\n\nImportant to work in teams:\n\nWe are not experts. In emergency situations, it's important to be 2.To build a base of knowledge to be collectively autonomous. Yes we live 20mins away from the hospital, but do they come in 20mins? No.\n\n\n\nREFLECTION:\n\n\nWhat does health autonomy look like for you?\nHow does your work or expertise contribute to that? \nWhat is it that you need, the next step for you?\n\n\n\nEugenia:\n\nArtist and ecologist\nProject How to perform an abortion.Reproductive health Laws are flawed. Autonomy is accountability.The space in which I'm most vulnerable is when I'm ignorant - ie when I enter a hospital.The next steps: continue this work, reintroducing women to a knowledge that was robbed from them.\n\n\n\n\nGeorgie:\nAutonomy is My ability to recognise my health care needs and ability to respond to them on a group level.\n\n\n\nBernard:\nHow do I stay healthy until I'm 60 and over, and how to die well. My steps: Movement yoga, group collaboration, nursing etc. Wants to be connected to group services - maybe connection with mainstream services? \n\n\nKashi:\nFrom a mental health group in Ireland.\n\n\nTerineh:\n\nThe Canaries, from Nyc, thinking outside of medical crises. Using arts as a place to reimagine infrastructures of care and psychosomatic healing. Over 80 autoimmune diseases, not known if it's caused by genetic or environmental causes. You need to find group support. 100 on the list sharing info and resources. Difficult because we are spread out and hard to support each other materially. \nBeing a support group for the disabled :Crip time when you don't have the energy to actually get that information. At odds with insurrectional anarchism. \nInterested in how we link with other people outside of our own and how to support that. \n\n\n\nTori:\nHow we can consent to things that happen to our body.PS: research on these practices and sharing info while building own tools. Trying to understand more tools for consensus decision making We feel exhausted\n\n\nMichael:\nAutonomy as agency. In the role of filling gaps: caring through technical skills, getting people to tell their stories better that are not the same as them\n\n\nZAD:\nAutonomy is the contrary to what you see in France and Belgium - a GP having 1000 people in care who all rely on him. Works 70hrs a week and is exhausted. In one community there are many people who can offer information and help. \n\n\n\nNadia:\n\n\nDiagnostic autonomy: feel confident in one's ability to understand their problem.\nKnowing where to go - organized knowledge ie barefoot doctor manual and having a contemporary equivalent. \n\nThe issue of navigating health care.\nformalized access to services and formalized", "created_at": "2017-11-21 15:57:52.751476", "updated_at": "2017-11-21 15:57:52.751476", "tag_id": 80, "post_id": 38787, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 7580}, {"id": 11881, "text": "", "quote": "50% of individual bankruptcies are due to a medical bill.

The bad effect of this treatment is not his non efficiency but also killing the healthy cells, even if he kill the cancer cells inside body.!!! From this treatment there are some bad effect like, appetiteless, loss of weight, weakness of antibody, ...)\u00a0\n\nActually, 7 people here in Madagascar have been heal by this treatment when they heard about it, and follow the instructions. It's \u00a0a close friend of mine who have been sick by \"liver and intestine\" cacer. He was up to follow chimiotherapy \u00a0treatment so I told him to follow this natural treatment \u00a0first before he decided to spend \u00a0money on chimiotherapy.

Doctors doesn't find any clue of cancer on him. Maybe the phase of his cacer was primary and it's was easy to cure.

This is your \"drinking water for one day\" the better moment for drinking much is before breakfast and dinner, also drinkable in middle time. Do it for 20 days and stop for 10 days.

One of the finest examples is SC!FY, a young organization based in Athens which in the course of four years managed to get a lot of stuff done. \n\nMy brother, George (Giannakopoulos) has been an Artificial Intelligence researcher who has worked both in Greece and the North of Italy for quite a few years and has had programming and IT consulting experience for over 15 years in the industry. He has been collaborating with researchers from both sides of the Atlantic. What he was experiencing as a researcher, was beyond his imagination. He puts it nicely:\n\n\"EU is spending billions of euros in research projects. Consortia of research institutes and big EU companies receive huge amounts of money to produce amazing technologies. Technologies that need only a few months of work to become great, potentially life\u00adchanging products. But most of them remain unused for years within the walls of the institutes that produce them. It seems absurd, but rarely does anyone undertake the little work that is required to bring top notch scientific results to our everyday lives. It is also common that researchers simply cannot grasp the direct impact a technology they create can have on everyday life, if applied in a friendly, accessible way.\"\n\nHe wanted to see it change - and so in 2012 he founded an organisation with a mission to publish and transform that knowledge into ready to use solutions. \n\nHe could not take it any longer. So, he and his cordial friend Vassilis (Salapatas) decided to bridge this gap between research and society. In 2012 they formed SciFY (Science For You), an Not for profit organization that does exactly this: take scientific results, and then form a community of entrepreneurs, volunteers, researchers and end users to build useful final products to solve everyday problems. And they offer them for free. To all.\n\nFor the first two years we strategically decided to prove that we are serious about what we do, we are able to deliver and \u2026 that we are not crooks (since trust towards NGOs has been very low in Greece after some scandals)\n\nWe also had to prove we are using freely available results (these are more and more common in EU, which requires many of the research it funds to publish their findings on the most open licenses possible). In the last 2,5 years, we\u2019ve started looking for funding and this is when plenty of things got done. \n\nWe have been awarded by the President of the Hellenic Republic, we\u2019ve built collaborations with most of the major Greek institutions - foundations, institutes, universities etc. We have a feeling that our impact is rather disproportionate compared to our size  But we really think this happens thanks to our focus on communities and our passion for getting things done. \n\nYou can read about our work in our annual report for 2015. \n\nThe model that we\u2019ve introduced to our work is to create communities around each of the ideas from the very beginning. We\u2019re also often asked to solve a particular problem by the very communities. This is one of the keys to our success - we\u2019re surrounded by people who want to see and use the results of our work. And they\u2019re actively taking part in the process. It helps us create a space where ideas, needs, opinions circulate and are being taken into account. \n\nSC!FY is working now in four domains - areas of interest.\n\nThe first area of interest is care-related and it focuses on creating assistive technologies for people with disabilities, and on offering them for free (and under open source licences). Among these are games for blind children, which have been developed in collaboration with schools for the blind - they helped us design them, tested and now use them. The process allowed us to bring together blind and non-blind people to work together. These games have more than 3,500 downloads from all around the world, got much media attention - and we constantly get positive feedback from people using them. So we continue developing more games for the bind. :-)\n\nWe\u2019ve also created a smartphone app called ICSee for people with low vision that applies special filters to the video captured by the phone\u2019s camera and allows users to read a restaurant menu or signs on the door. It\u2019s also available for free and under open source licences on Google Play.. \n\nWe\u2019re finishing the development of Talk and Play, a platform for people with motor disabilities, that will kick-off in late September. This application will help people who can\u2019t move or talk to communicate with their environment, watch videos, listen to music, or play games that support their rehabilitation. \n\nWe have created more solutions in this area, that you can find here.\n\nThe second area of our work is e- democracy. In this strand, we\u2019ve built an open source platform DemocracIT that supports the process of public consultation, which is theoretically common in Greece, but tedious in reality. We\u2019ve tested it and presented to the governmental bodies. Besides, there is also ActiveCommons platform, which we\u2019ve designed to foster collaboration for the common good between It caters organisations, NGOs and groups of people who want to change something and need an effective tool for collaboration. \n\nThe third scope of our work is supporting civil society with our IT skills. One of the results of such collaborations is a volunteer management platform - available for free, as well. \n\nAnd finally, the fourth pillar of our work is the Artificial Intelligence business. One of the outcomes of our work is NewSum that produces automated news summaries, and works in many languages. Or PServer application, that helps you personalise other applications. \n\nHow do you cope with finding financing outside your own country?

This enables treatment to be offered more cheaply, as well as creating a shared space of communal healing, so that healthcare becomes a site of community empowerment. There are now over 170 such clinics in the US and more than 50 in the UK (you can read about their history and ethos on the websites of POCA and ACMAC).\n\nAs I detailed in my original Opencare blog post, I have been slowly evolving a CMAC of my own to serve a small and somewhat dysfunctional market town in the South-West of the UK. Through this process, a number of tough lessons and intriguing insights have emerged, with broader implications for the innovative provision of care in contemporary European societies.\n\nI subtitled my initial post \u201cAn Ongoing Mutation\u201d both in reference to the overall development of the approach in the West and to my own experience of developing a clinic. This experience has been one of trial and error, of creative response to practical and bureaucratic challenges, and of constant adaptation to feedback from \u2013 and through ongoing relationship with \u2013 the community; as I learn more about their needs and perspective, I have changed the way I am treating, the way I interact with patients, the hours treatment is offered and the venue it is offered in.\n\nTo ask, as a state bureaucrat convinced of the usefulness of CMACs might, \u201chow can we replicate this so that we can roll it out across the country at an official level?\u201d rather misses the point; it is precisely by being embedded in the community that this process of creative mutation can occur, and precisely by meeting patients outside the usual structures of state-sanctioned medical authority that a more horizontal trust and respect can be created, and a more creative approach to healthcare provision enacted.\n\nLike many of the other projects featured in OpenCare, the flexibility of Community Acupuncture \u2013 light on infrastructure, expensive medical equipment or architectural requirements, reliant instead on the portable diagnostic and treatment skills of the practitioner \u2013 makes it well-suited to navigating a disrupted present and an uncertain future. Quite aside from its effectiveness at treating unexplained and chronic conditions (the kind mainstream Western medicine does not excel at curing), having the ability to treat without reliance on fragile, resource-intensive and environmentally-damaging industrial supply chains may well prove to be a great asset in the near future. Indeed, the worth of this is already being proven through the work of charitable foundations like World Medicine, who have set up successful CMACs in poor, rural areas of India, Palestine, Nepal and Sri Lanka.\n\nProblems still remain, not least with the institutional resistance to acupuncture \u2013 often based on little more than ill-informed prejudice against \u2018alternative\u2019 medicine. There are clashes within the acupuncture community, as well, on how best to treat, and issues with providing quality-assurance and redress to patients whilst working outside the usual channels and institutions of healthcare.\n\nNevertheless, the popularity and effectiveness of CMACs speak for themselves. All too often, the state-established institutions of care remain locked into a post-imperial perspective, treating the body, the patient or the polis as the passive subject of a homogenised, top-down intervention.\n\nIt is a little like a digital advertising screen, broadcasting a single, one-way message to a public who have no choice but to receive it. Just like a digital advertising screen, this kind of healthcare can seem cutting-edge, innovative and technologically impressive, but its values do not respect the uniqueness of individual or place, nor do they promote communal solidarity and empowerment. So long as this is the case, communities will continue to vote with their feet, seeking out new forms of adaptive Open Care that address their real mental, physical and social needs.\n\n\n\nI would love to see Community Acupuncture being integrated with some of the other projects and approaches detailed in OpenCare; to hear suggestions about how the CMAC model could be further improved and evolved; and, as ever, I am keen for people to educate themselves about acupuncture, to help fight against the misguided myths that have arisen about it, and to spread the word about this affordable, effective, environmentally-friendly and humane form of medicine!\n\nSteve Wheeler, Lic.

This income generation activity was not only adopted by CBOs but also adopted by other communities and all the voulteers of CBOs are working with the RI team as volunteer and own the work with full participation.\nAlthough we have started this project in July 2012 with limited team but we have achieved majority targets of project in the short period of time that\u00a0\u00a0not only show the better planning of project but showed the excellent participation of CBOs and community also.\nCntribution is needed now more than ever to ensure livelihood of the farmers with\u00a0 Program continues to serve those in most need.

How do we create the conditions for\u00a0#opencare in our organisations and our communities? How do we design communities and organisations that are care-full, and promote health and flourishing? I'm curious about the interplay between policy and culture (as in ways of doing things rather than music and art). Are policies simply\u00a0agreements about what we think works and what is right at any given time? Moreover how are they implemented at government or\u00a0regional levels and in organisations, if they are to be more than good intentions? Do they end up needing enforced or policed by someone? Are they a tool of old ways of doing things built on hierarchy and power over? What role can they play in\u00a0creating the conditions for\u00a0opencare or for that matter for love and acceptance and generating\u00a0the sense of coherence that Antonovsky describes in salutogenesis\u00a0and its approach to study what creates health and well being rather than researching dis-ease?\n\nMy work through the GalGael Trust based in the Govan area of Glasgow has offered some hints that actively generating\u00a0a healthy\u00a0culture is perhaps more effective in achieving in an anchored way the 'good intentions' of policy. Strong values guide actions, decisions and\u00a0behaviour, influence language and how we treat one another. Our workshop sees people working, for the most, part side by side. We\u2019ve had people with violent histories, people who suffer agoraphobia, depression and addiction. Yet something about the space we\u2019ve created has meant that people largely get on, there\u2019ve been no violent incidents in our 20 year history and people describe their doctor taking them off medication, sometimes for the first time in many\u00a0years.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s not a silver bullet. People lapse. They fall back in to the darkness at times. But there is something undeniable about the environment we\u2019ve created and actively generate that has a therapeutic affect. While some of our participants and volunteers have said \u2018the work is the therapy\u2019 - this refers to the hands on purpose they find in their labours not the work we do with them. So is this as a result of policy or culture? What is it that creates the conditions for an environment of open care? How do we understand the architectures of love that are called for to create a more care-full society?\n\nWe\u2019ve recently spent a year curating a collaborative process to explore what it means to \u2018be GalGael\u2019. It saw us going back to our beginnings and drawing on the learning from our days as an anti-motorway protest camp. We wrestled with our assumptions - which were shared and which were disputed?\u00a0We explored whether our purpose was actually underneath it all - to bring about greater love. This contributes to our being in a good place to\u00a0explore this theme more widely in our own organisation\u00a0and its practical application in more depth.\n\nThrough the process we would like to connect and learn from other organisations exploring this theme.\u00a0\n\nWhat kind of structures and processes are essential building blocks or make up the \u2019hardware\u2019?\n\nWhat kind internal capacities and approaches make up the \u2018software\u2019 that keep a healthy organisation, healthy community or healthy societies humming with human flourishing?\n\nThe theme could also link to other themes that explore how we create the conditions such as:\n\n\ncitizens income and the politics of time;\nnature of collaboration and how we exercise our freedoms and capacities;\nthe nature of work in care-full societies;\nforms of leadership and personal capacity called for.\u00a0\n\n\nI\u2019m very new to Edgeryders and I\u2019ve not had much time to develop this so would appreciate feedback and thoughts as to whether this might be a theme of interest to others.", "created_at": "2017-11-25 23:25:54.834695", "updated_at": "2017-11-25 23:25:54.834695", "tag_id": 1958, "post_id": 6304, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 6271}, {"id": 14078, "text": "", "quote": "I am not a fan of cars in any form (I can't make economic sense of moving people point-to-point in a vehicle each), but it is a really fascinating project because it applies the open source model to potentially large-scale physical manufacturing.", "created_at": "2018-07-29 21:41:50.363831", "updated_at": "2018-07-29 21:41:50.363831", "tag_id": 3145, "post_id": 15629, "creator_id": 4155, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 1432}, {"id": 19223, "text": "", "quote": "perhaps it's good to make each other available for listening and advice, in private rooms.", "created_at": "2020-05-19 15:01:32.974193", "updated_at": "2020-09-24 14:49:42.520480", "tag_id": 5281, "post_id": 74141, "creator_id": 5059, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 13158}, {"id": 26867, "text": "", "quote": "In the past few years, following a number of scandals, public opinion and general awareness have shifted, but I think there is still a strong undercurrent of 'law and order' arguments.

Its model has inspired centres across Europe, while MetaReciclagem \u2013 a Brazilian initiative directly informed by Access Space \u2013 has now grown to a network of almost a hundred centres.\n\nI founded Access Space in 2000 - but I had the idea in 1996 - when I started an arts project called \"Redundant Technology Initiative\". I'm an artist, and I wanted to use my art practice to show the true situation in Sheffield, the city where I live. Sheffield has suffered structural problems from massive industrial change - the city used to be based on Coal mining and the Steel industry. Now the coal mines are closed, and the Steel mills are manned by robots. There is a very high level of unemployment in the city, and much of the employment that there is is in the public sector - most adults work for the government!\n\nWorking as an artist, I saw that the city was failing to adapt to the emerging information economy - South Yorkshire had the lowest uptake of information technology in the UK. Meanwhile, I was making art from trash that I found in skips. Not only was the trash free (yes!) it seemed to me to be the most suitable material with which to make art about urban decline.\n\nThen I started to find computers in the trash. I collected them, with the idea that I would make robot sculptures and other crazy artworks. I was amazed to discover, after some experimentation, that most of the PCs I recovered actually worked! I started to think about why people were throwing these machines away - when the city had a low level of engagement with information technology.\n\nSo I started an arts group, \"Redundant Technology Initiative\" with one rule - we would be the people who would be creative with trash computers. But ONLY trash computers! We would refuse to pay for any technology, and only use what we could get for free. (This was lucky, because me and my friends were unemployed or unpaid artists, and thus completely skint.) We had a few exhibitions, and each time we exhibited, people brought us more computers. Being artists, we made them into \"an art installation\". (Other people might think, with some justification, that what we had made was was just \"a huge pile\".)\n\nBy 1998 we had rented a warehouse which was scheduled for demolition. One good feature of industrial decline is that space is cheap. We had more than 1000 computers (!!!) some of which worked, some of which could work, and some of which were broken. We made a HUGE installation for a digital arts festival... and then more and more people gave us computers. After a few weeks we had more than 2000 machines.\n\nWe started to realise two things:\n\n(1) We didn't have any shortage of computers.\n\n(2) We did have a shortage of skill, expertise and creativity.\n\nWe learned how to rebuild and reprogram computers really fast, and we found students who also wanted to help. A local college sent us their trainees on \"work placement\" - and they learned as they helped us to repair the massive numbers of machines. But we then had a very embarrassing problem for an art group. We just weren't creative enough. We couldn't think of cool things to do with more than about 100 computers - we needed to think of cool things to do with 100 computers PER MONTH.\n\nSo we designed \"Access Space\" - a digital lab where people can walk in and show us how they could be creative and productive with trash technology. It took 2 years to raise enugh money to start, and after we started, we managed to get ERDF funding to match our initial funds. (NOTE that there was no way we could have accessed ERDF funding with our levels of experience. We came in as a minor delivery partner, insulated from the frightening bureaucracy of the project by more experienced lead partners. This was very lucky for us - and could start a whole new conversation.)\n\nSo, in 2000 Access Space opened. We believed it would be a good model to help people get engaged with technology. We invite every visitor to define their OWN objectives with trash technology - it could be making images, sounds, music, robots, websites, designs, photo galleries... It could be building a business, making new networks, rebuilding computers, or whatever. Our key test is that people THEMSELVES set their agenda. We don't work with a curriculum. And we don't have teachers. Instead, we ask participants to help each other - and because they're all working on \"cool stuff\" not \"boring stuff\" then people are usually happy to help - and maybe gain ideas, skills and expertise from the experience.\n\nWe provide a free, open access digital lab, doing all sorts of things, from computer analysis, repair and recycling to art exhibitions, workshops, peer-learning activities, enterprise incubation, social support and more. We set up this lab as a response to unemployment, urban decline and the transformation of the job market. What we've established is an innovative methodology to invest time, not money, in ICTs. This has huge potential to address worklessness and lack of opportunities. It's worth reflecting that many of our participants in Access Space experience the kind of precarity which you are investigating with Edgeryders.\n\nAccess Space has a very wide range of participation.\n\n\nIf you split them into three groups, <25years, 25-50years, >50 years, then those groups are roughly similar in size.\nRoughly 1/3 of our participants are from minority ethnic backgrounds.\nAround 1/3 of our participants have a university education.\nAlmost 2/3 of our participants are unemployed, or under-employed.\nAround 1/5 of our participants have some form of disability or long-term illness - particularly learning difficulties, like Asperger's Syndrome (associated with high intelligence) and mental health difficulties, such as depression.\n1/10 of our participants have a serious problem with housing. Either they're homeless, or they are living in insecure, or temporary accommodation.\n\n\nWe had more than 2000 people use the space in 2011, which added up to more than 12000 hours of usage. Helping and facilitating this number of people, particularly when some of them have difficulties, is a huge job.\n\nWhen it comes to funding, the significance of Access Space's budget is how small it is for the outcomes it delivers. Access Space principally sustains itself by saving money. A typical annual budget is only around \u00a3100K. We have survived by raising funds, and by saving money. We save around \u00a330000 each year by only using recycled computers and free, open source software. We have a very small core team (now usually 6, now 7 people, mostly part-time) who are on short-term contracts.\n\nOur special power with funding is the huge range of benefits that Access Space brings. We help people:\n\n\nMake creative progress - by engaging with digital creativity.\nMake technical progress - learning new high-tech skills.\nMake social progress - by helping each other, and by working together, people learn crucial soft skills, and develop more useful networks.\nMake progress with employability and enterprise. (These we see as the ultimate extension of all the types of progress people make.)\n\n\nThis means that we have a wide range of stakeholders. We have been funded to:\n\n\nIncrease high-tech skills for local enterprises.\nGet people involved with the digital arts.\nHelp people become \"digitally included\".\nResearch and test new models for peer learning.\nDevelop and incubate micro-enterprises.\nDevelop high-tech skills with innovation potential.\nHelp people to become included in mainstream society, and become more employable.\n\n\nWhat do we want? Funding, of course! However, we are aware that models based on funding are becoming increasingly under pressure. So we have started a \"Friends\" scheme, to ask our participants, and anyone else who thinks that the free opportunities we deliver are a good thing, to contribute.\n\nBut we also need more participation by people who understand the challenge, and want to help. We want people who are interested to help us facilitate the community, build functioning social and economic networks, and experiment with how we can mobilise the talents and skills of the larger and larger number of unemployed people we encounter.\n\nWe realise now that the most valuable technology that is being discarded by our society is PEOPLE. We are seeing talented, skilled people unmobilised, and we think that this is a criminal waste. We also see deeply uninspiring, value-free jobs (like working in call centres) as the only structural answer put forward by mainstream business and industry, and we want people to work with us to develop more inspiring, creative, engaging, and socially valuable jobs as an alternative.\n\nWe need:\n\n\nMore volunteers who are interested to work with a wide range of people, and are interested to challenge social exclusion and division.\nEnterprising people who are interested in starting their own business and can see the potential to work in a social, creative and technical context.\nOpen source software enthusiasts who want to help us spread the word. We have a number of specific software and hardware challenges which we could use help with.\nOther spaces across Europe who would like to collaborate with us to develop a network of social, technical and creative spaces. We have contacts already, but many spaces are just \"technical and social\" or \"creative and technical\" or \"social and creative\". We are looking for groups that want to be \"technical, social, AND creative\".\n\n\nThis would be the gist of what we're doing with this project. If you are passionate about techs and open source software, let me know and maybe we can collaborate. Also, if your're around Sheffield and would like to visit our establishment, also drop a line; We're currently working with x volunteers, but would be happy to take you in if you're up for this!\u00a0\n\nFind us at:\n\n\n  \n    access-space.org\n  \n  \n    \n\nAccess Space\n\nMaking and Unmaking\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/accessspace\n\nhttp://twitter.com/AccessSpace\n\nFinally, to see our work in action, I leave you in the company of this video of the Recycle Mid-Weekend we organized in March last year:", "created_at": "2017-11-25 23:52:28.995509", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:00:53.712560", "tag_id": 62, "post_id": 1710, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 1677}, {"id": 19187, "text": "", "quote": "and the opportunities for innovation in designing for a near future with less sociality as we know it?", "created_at": "2020-05-19 14:36:37.316534", "updated_at": "2020-09-08 11:50:40.179322", "tag_id": 5498, "post_id": 73854, "creator_id": 5059, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 13158}, {"id": 19170, "text": "", "quote": "I hope that we find a vaccine soon.", "created_at": "2020-05-16 12:02:17.188266", "updated_at": "2020-08-31 18:32:13.968175", "tag_id": 978, "post_id": 73853, "creator_id": 5059, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 13158}, {"id": 19143, "text": "", "quote": "Probably right.

With that said, however, there can be a substantial learning curve when it comes to acquiring a comprehensive understanding of what is actually being proposed by the Project. It is important to remember that this community proposal represents an entirely different linguistic worldview than most (if not all) other worldviews present in modern society. Fundamentally, the Community\u2019s design describes an entirely divergent way of living and of understanding reality than the many worldviews expressed among the current population of the planet. This can present a significant motivating challenge for those interested in this direction. The design specifications are dense in content and many individuals who read them for the first time feel like they are learning a new language and integrating a new worldview, which takes time and requires internal processing.First Steps and Key Features\n\nAs a first step we are going to establish a \u201cTraining and Research Network\u201d - primarily for tertiary education | higher education - to enable educators to understand and facilitate the train of thought of an integral, holistic, evolutionary, self-directed, self-integrated and self-civilization and are looking for places to establish training and cultural exchange centers. With tis comes an network of self organizing solidly co-habitational care Nuklei.\n\nAs we have to exist within a framework of formal-operational rules (orange), at best early vision-logic (green), we have to establish a set of \u201corganizational-bodies\u201d to support the idea in the best way possible.\n\nThe key features have to be adapted as part of part of a living organisation! To date, our core themes are:\n\n\n\n\nNew Learning\n\n\n\n\nCreating Creative Learning (Spaces)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunication\n\n\n\n\nArt\n\n\nintegral News Communication\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Socio-Economic Development\n\n\n\n\nNew socio-economic systems that focus on resource availability;\n\n\nexperience an reserch a new way of care for each other including health care and social security aspects;\n\n\ndeveloopment of strategies for mental health and healty living environments;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntegral Leadership, integral management systems\n\n\n\n\nliving- and holonic organizations, Assessment, creating \u201cSelforganizing Open Hierarchical Order\u201d Systems, (olocracy)\n\n\ncentre attention on the evolution of human values and consciousness as the crucial factors in changing course \u2014 from a race towards degradation, polarization and disaster to a rethinking of values and priorities so as to navigate today's transformation in the direction of humanism, ethics and global sustainability\" Ervin Laszlo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSustainable Engineering and Application\n\n\n\n\nApplication of sustainable energy production;\n\n\nHigh-Tech in ecological production processes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe design for the community is not yet sufficiently complete to plan its implementation. However, we presently have a \u2018scope of work\u2019, and we are in the process of converting it into a comprehensive project plan.\n\nWe are initiateing multilingual communities and living space with people who focus primarily on inner development. Where we are working on our consciousness, because the crisis in our society is a crisis of consciousness. We shift our focus inwards, develop our relationship skills and transform our social programming. There should be as few fixed guidelines as possible concerning the personality and lifestyle of the members except the common to work toward a higher level of development. There are no ideologies, no dogmatic requirements and no fixed concepts.\u201cCAPE\u00a0 aims to build a social net for the members, enacts \"share & care\" principles and provides a framework (legal body) for cooperative economy as well as a space for inter-generational \"new\", action based, co-operative learning.\nCAPE should be a special place for members and learners to revive, a place to flourish, a place for young and old. Sustainable mental health is a result of continuous enthusiasm to our own development and a willingness reconstruct our beliefs.\nWe, the initiators of CAPE LearnLust & Living think that the acceleration of our lives and the deluge of controversy, often absurd and paranoid information from an ailing socio-economic structure leads to the desire of many people for contemplation, inversion and a return to ethical values that are inherent to all human beings, but in \"our experienced world\" increasingly seem to disappear. Sincere joy, love for everything around us, to nature, compassion for each other, time to talk, to feel and enjoy, no longer being so tense and stretched - internally driven, yet not knowing where to go.\nAutonomous and healthy life for the young and the joyful old. To create the miracle called \"we\", which awakens us to renewed life! To unmask the process of maturing as ripening and getting wise. Therefore, we are now tackling this \u2026\nWhat do we perceive? Today our society offers almost unlimited possibilities. This diversity can lead us humans to exhaustion, confusion and disorientation, to sensory overload, burnout! Therefore, every human being is faced with the challenge of finding answers to the following questions:\n\n\n\nWho am I really?\n\n\nWhy am I here?\n\n\nWho or what gives me meaning and footing?\n\n\nWhat is my inherent value?\n\n\nWhere do I want to go?\n\n\nOur goal is to develop as a group to the extent that we understand each other at the height of the developmental stage now possible. These levels of human development are researched and described scientifically. It does not matter at what age we come together, it's fun and is exciting to get to know thyself and develop. As pioneers of a new action based, co-operative learning we share our special talents and skills with those interested. We are convinced that sustainable social change in the global community depends on the quality of personal development, training and the ability to effectively and constructively communicate with others. The focus is on interaction and cooperation, shared responsibility and authority, and the improvement of critical thinking. There is no 'teacher' in the traditional sense. Learning will be self-organizing, dynamically adjusted to needs and ideas of the \"learners\".", "created_at": "2017-11-26 00:02:19.382143", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:00:53.960897", "tag_id": 80, "post_id": 765, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 732}, {"id": 11967, "text": "", "quote": "We missed you @Woodbinehealth , welcome back.

So far, we have followed\u00a0two different approaches:\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0ScImpulse, WeMake and City of Milano focus on an engaging offline experience for participants. Conveners take notes, photos etc. They then editorialize them and upload them onto the platform.\n\n\nEdgeryders focus on offering people with good stories help for them to put them on the platform. Workshops are organized not by Edgeryders itself (though we do take part), but by active community members. The same also provide most of the help.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBoth methods are hard. Both have drawbacks.\n\nThe first method is mostly failing. It is difficult to make sense of notes taken during the meeting. I had this experience during \"Taking care\", where I volunteered to take notes with Cristina. Afterwards, I could interpret my notes, but not hers (though we were using the same \u00a0Google Doc! ). I imagine the opposite was true for her. Many notes never make it online. Those that do take the form of a report: \"A said this, B said that\". The community tends not to engage with this type of format.\u00a0\n\nThe second method has given better results.\u00a0\u00a0Still,\u00a0it discourages people who are not good communicators in writing, face language barriers etc.\u00a0\n\nHow to move forward? The Milan meeting gave us two promising leads.\n\nThe first one was offered by @costantino and @alessandrocontini . They pointed out that the mechanics of makers collaboration is not so social. You go to the forum, ask a question, get a pointer, solve the problem and move on. It may be difficult to track it through an online forum.\n\nThe second one results from\u00a0something interesting that happened during \"Taking care\". This: people in the Bordeaux group at some point felt their contribution was unnecessary and possibly unwelcome. They withdrew from the workshop and moved to a different room. They kept working on opencare, but in the form of writing code to look at the conversation.\u00a0\n\nThis resonates with an Edgeryders\u00a0conversation thread\u00a0that predates opencare.\u00a0It says this: the \"meeting\"\u00a0or \"assembly\" format claims to be inclusive, but in fact it is not. Instead, it rewards extrovert, confident, even narcissistic personalities. Introverts don't like to speak in public,\u00a0certainly not without thinking things through. So they never speak. This issue has come to the fore in the hacker community, where many skilled developers identify as intros. Intros like online, where they can take time to think things through, and where they do not have to interrupt others to claim space.\u00a0See for example\u00a0this great comment\u00a0by @trythis\u00a0and the thread that comes with it. As a result, offline spaces are exclusionary. They do not know it...\u00a0because they exclude\u00a0the people who never speak up.\u00a0\n\nThe post-it workshop format has a\u00a0second potential problem. It has no space for\u00a0contributions\u00a0in\u00a0forms other than the speech (as Cicero describes in\u00a0De Oratore). The role of facilitators is to \"standardize\" contributions. Some people (like @Noemi in \"Taking care\") feel that this negates serendipity and predetermines results.\n\nIf this is true, a lot of design-based methods of engagement have a serious flaw. What's worse, an\u00a0unacknowledged\u00a0one. Given their popularity, this is serious.\n\nSo, I propose we\u00a0\"go deep\", doing research and producing one or more papers on:\n\n\n\n\n\nAn ethnography of makers collaboration. How important is the space? How important is StackOverflow or similar? What constitues \"good\" collaboration (Alessandro: \"the less interactive and more efficient, the better\")?\u00a0\n\n\n\nA model of the interface between online and\u00a0offline collaboration. We promised to build this anyway in the proposal.\n\n\n\nA critique of the post-it workshop as a technique for collective intelligence.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAll of this should, in my opinion, have a design perspective. I propose that @Ezio_Manzini coordinates the activities and writes one or two papers under items 2 and 3.\u00a0ER would be happy to support this.\u00a0And I would love to see WeMake and ScImpulse appoint an ethnographer to look into item 1.\u00a0\n\nThoughts?", "created_at": "2017-11-26 00:12:18.455309", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:00:54.463065", "tag_id": 120, "post_id": 6069, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 6036}, {"id": 11975, "text": "", "quote": "Dandelion \"Pissenlit\" roots for cure cacer, Yes it's possible and without fees!!\n\n\u00a0There are many different types of cancer any people get killed by it.

The readings are then transferred wirelessly, over the mobile-phone network to specialists in distant urban centers for interpretation, diagnosis and prescribed treatment.\n\nHere is the full story:\n\nBy making it possible to perform tests, such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) in far-flung villages, the tablet is bringing high-quality cardiac care to remote and often poorly equipped countryside clinics where many Cameroonians go for their health care. It connects rural patients suffering from heart disease, many of whom do not have the means, the time, the contacts or the strength to travel to the big city, with Cameroon\u2019s few, primarily urban-based cardiologists.\n\n\n2014_05_art_2_1.jpg768x509\nThe Cardiopad, developed by 26-year-old Cameroonian engineer, Arthur Zang, promises to bring high quality cardiac care to remote rural communities. It is built to withstand the humid climate and rough terrain of outlying villages. Equipped with a battery, it can run independently for around six hours at full power. (Photo: E. Harris/WIPO).\n\nThe potentially life-saving Cardiopad \u2013 designed in Cameroon to address a Cameroonian problem, but which is also widespread across Africa \u2013 is the brainchild of 26-year-old engineer Arthur Zang. For now, the heart reading and interpretation are just a simulation \u2013 but that will change soon if Mr. Zang gets his way.\n\nThe winner of numerous overseas awards and grants, Mr. Zang hopes that his invention \u2013 imagine an iPad with home-build software built for deployment in the African bush \u2013 will revolutionize cardiac care in Cameroon. And for him, his business is also personal.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people in my family who suffer from cardiac illness,\u201d he says referring to the recent heart-related death of his uncle. \u201cSo personally, this has affected me but above all I would say it has impassioned me, because I know personally the daily existence of people living in the village \u2026 I lived myself in a village and I know how difficult it is to get specialist care.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mr. Zang, Cameroon has only a few dozen cardiologists in a country of around 22 million people and these are clustered in urban centers like the capital, Yaounde, or the main seaport town of Douala. Roughly half of Cameroon\u2019s population lives in rural areas, according to the World Bank, while many others live in urban areas that do not have access to heart specialists.\n\nLife-saving potential\n\nThe young engineer saw a problem and set out to try to fix it. In 2009, while still a student, Mr. Zang began developing a software product that could help doctors monitor the health of their patients\u2019 hearts. He made contact with a Yaounde-based cardiologist, Professor Samuel Kingu\u00e9, who helped him better understand the type of technical solutions required. With these insights, the young engineer finally wrote a program that he loaded onto an off-the-shelf device. But he soon realized he needed the flexibility of his own platform, and so turned to developing his own hardware \u2013 the Cardiopad. \u2013 the first medical tablet in Africa, says Mr. Zang.\n\nThe Cardiopad has a simple-to-use, touchscreen interface that is adapted to the needs of remote health workers who may lack familiarity with the latest computing devices and the know-how required to use them. In tests by the Cameroonian scientific community, the Cardiopad has proven 97.7 percent reliable. It is solidly built to withstand the humid climate and the shocks incurred while being carried over rutted, often unpaved dirt roads like the one leading to the clinic at Mbankomo. The device is also built to withstand the frequent power cuts experienced in Cameroon and across Africa. Equipped with a battery, it can run independently for around six hours at full power.\n\nWith some 30,000 euros funding from the Cameroonian government, Mr. Zang was able to create a prototype and eventually travel to China, where he found a factory that could produce a limited run of Cardiopads while he searched around for partners to help fund his venture. Obtaining investments has been difficult. Finding the right contact in overseas companies is a challenge and the pitch is no easier. The device is designed to help Africans in rural, impoverished communities; \u00a0something that not all companies see as a promising prospect, Mr. Zang says. That\u2019s why he intends to tap into a very modern financing model \u2013 crowd-funding on platforms such as Kickstarter, where users can donate funds to, or purchase shares in, fledgling firms.\n\nFor now, he is searching for more funding, hoping to build upon the CHF 50,000 grant he received as a Rolex Award Young Laureate 2014. While funding issues have been a constraint, the pilot tablets he has been able to produce are now being tested in hospitals in Cameroon.\n\nMr. Zang\u2019s aim is to produce and sell his device for around 2,200 euros which is significantly cheaper than other commercially available, less portable devices. The hope is that hospitals purchasing the low-cost Cardiopad will be able to lower the price of medical examinations and speed-up medical diagnoses.\n\n\n2014_05_art_2_2.jpg768x704\n(PHOTO: MIMORE MEDICAL)Patenting the Cardiopad\n\nHe also turned to the intellectual property (IP) system to help advance his work. In December 2011, he applied for a patent via the Organisation Africaine de la Propri\u00e9t\u00e9 Intellectuelle (OAPI) in Yaounde [see box]. OAPI later granted him a patent (No. 16213) on his technology, covering some aspects of both the software and the hardware.\n\nObtaining a patent was an important step for Mr. Zang. \u201cI did it to reassure myself,\u201d he said, \u201calso to protect the product, and to have a lot more credibility in the eyes of, for example, partners with whom I wanted to sign contracts in order to be able to produce and then sell the product.\u201d\n\nWhen funds permit, he also plans to register the Cardiopad, and his company, Himore Medical, which currently produces the tablet, as trademarks.\n\n\u201cThe intellectual property system can help us in Africa \u2013 it can add credibility to African products. And credibility has repercussions on the business plan because if you aren\u2019t credible, it\u2019s difficult to sell your product,\u201d says Mr. Zang.\n\nDriving new developments\n\nThe budding entrepreneur is already in collaboration with other young Cameroonian engineers to develop a range of additional medical devices and technologies for rural areas. He points to what he views as a disconnect in the innovation environment in Cameroon: in the medical space, in particular, many of the creators and inventors are young like him \u2013 roughly half of Cameroon\u2019s population is under the age of 18 \u2013 so they rarely suffer from the diseases that products like the Cardiopad are designed to address.\n\nFurther, with a rapidly urbanizing population, urban dwellers may all too easily overlook the specific needs of those living in remote rural areas. For Mr. Zang, innovation requires a flexible mindset, a deep understanding of an entire economic ecosystem and an ability to commercialize ideas.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t only have engineering ideas,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have to go further, into researching the problems confronting Africans and then pursue research into solutions, subsidize the creation of companies, create business incubators that can help nurture projects, researchers, engineers and really help them move from the laboratory to the factory.\u201d\n\nPursuing a dream\n\nUltimately, Mr. Zang\u2019s dream is to continue working to \u201cimprove life conditions\u201d by branching out into other areas of medical technology, envisioning specially adapted devices for echography and radiology.\n\nIn the Mbankomo clinic, the lack of these higher-end materials is evident. Surrounded by a tidy plot of well-brushed soil dotted with shade trees, the one-story clinic is austere. Patient consulting rooms are cooled by open windows, but little advanced machinery is on display. Mr. Zang says doctors at the facility are overwhelmed by the health needs of patients, which range from the mundane to the mortal. Connecting these clinics to better-resourced hospitals elsewhere via the mobile phone system is establishing a lifeline.\n\nMr. Zang hopes ultimately to manufacture the Cardiopad in Cameroon, and to help the country develop as a manufacturing center for lower-cost devices specifically tailored to low-resource environments and markets, like those in West Africa.\n\n\u201cThis will help lower the cost of medical exams and the cost of good health across the regions, in the villages,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s it, that\u2019s the dream that is smoldering in me.\u201d", "created_at": "2017-11-26 00:15:40.540378", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:00:55.035559", "tag_id": 137, "post_id": 555, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 522}, {"id": 11977, "text": "", "quote": "Hospital to Home team striving for a healthier and happier Derby", "created_at": "2017-11-26 00:18:43.347329", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:00:55.074069", "tag_id": 145, "post_id": 31827, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 725}, {"id": 11978, "text": "", "quote": "With an anthro perspective it turns out that the most important thing after a hear attack are your friends!", "created_at": "2017-11-26 00:19:39.263139", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:00:55.112243", "tag_id": 146, "post_id": 23866, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 516}, {"id": 11979, "text": "", "quote": "Great sharing, JUS team and @Omri_Kaufmann in particular!\u00a0\n\nI am out of my depth: I have been sad but never depressed, exhausted but never burnt out.

Weak signals.\nGently and extremely considerately nudge the addressed introvert towards the other introverts. If that does not work, understanding which case can be helped by what kind of pressure (hint: only 1 in 10 can).\n\n\nSounds simple right? Just 5 steps to world domination...\n\nThe trick is that each of the steps has requirements the respective subjects will by default not do, or do in a very, very bad way. If you don't feel offended by this sentence - this is highly likely true for you as well. Sorry. Please do feel offended, this is not going to work in anyone's comfort zone (or it would be happening all the time). I'll explain each of the steps in a little more detail. Just to rub it in.\n\nIf you fail at the first step the game ends there. It can't be skipped. As I am talking to extrovert community managers**, you need to start with finding an introvert. This will be hard for many of you because the last time you saw one is \"the unpopular kid\" in school. After this compulsory community, most strong extros mingle with other strong extros - and intros almost vanish from their life as it is awkward to have one between 8 other extros. Imagine the unpopular kid did not vanish, but once in a while checked your social network accounts in the last couple of years, and just shook his/her head at what you were doing. How misguided. How superficial. Most of the intros time however went into building self esteem over (failed attempts at) solving some ridiculously complicated, almost impossible problem.\n\nHow do you find this person? It is hard. You can look through your network all you want - it is full of other extros. And they are isolated. Especially, the powerful and strong intros. What are you to do? Ring random doorbells? Not quite, but searching for activities that would attract introverts may help (certain music or movies are a strong cue if they apply to your culture). In short: Go where other people (especially you and your friends) don't like to go, and see who is there. Listen and watch for weak signals. Another method would be to bring a couple of your extrovert friends to a relatively random crowd, and then be very extrovert in everyone's face. The ones that are running away are the ones you're looking for.\n\nThis can be easier and usually much faster to do on/with the internet. Actually, if you end up in a place that you don't understand, and people behave strangely - chances are you stumbled upon a community of mild intros. The strong introvert is like a Yeti. It leaves big footsteps but is rarely seen in person. \n\nSometimes a mild intro may be the gatekeeper of one or more strong intros. Thus getting to the real powerful connections is always a two step process. First you have to win trust and show you can engage an intro on their terms. Then you get into their sanctum. Having intro-respected people who will vow for your integrity makes things easier as you progress. But remember, you are in a different ecosystem that has different requirements and different dynamics. Okay, this was long - because you have to get it right or there is no point.\n\n\nIf you have an issue and found your introvert, you will have to find out this introverts needs. For that you'll have to understand in quite some detail what he/she is trying to achieve. Then discuss or observe how the work is conducted. If you can think of ways to improve the workflow you could carefully put them on the table, mostly to watch why and how they will be declined. Assume an intro will be too shy to tell you about the real motivation, so watch for weak signals on that. Networking / collaboration opportunities to be may be be ignored (often because they don't mix with the work mode). Carefully feel around why each opportunity is not taken, and let the explanations stand for now. We'll come to the emotional commitment in point 4.\nThe \"without breaking it\" part is crucial. I have done and attended quite a bit of interviews with conventional main stream media on scientific topics. Almost without fail, they disfigure the message - not seldom making exactly the mistake you explicitly implored them not to do. Less mainstream media (introvert niches) usually fares better. In the age of exact copy&paste or digital recording options this can be improved a lot. Just make sure whatever happens, the original detailed data can be quickly found, and you find a combination of cat pictures (transmission) and differential equations (reception) you can both live with.\nIf you got this far you already have a decent chance at this part. Unfortunately introverts are pretty diverse on some fronts (and blindingly simple on some others) so tread carefully initially. Chances are, if you come across as informed and sincere, and the other intro you have in tow is compatible, the emotional commitment part is not going to be difficult for you. It'll be more difficult for you to believe someone will have a emotional reaction to such a complicated concept.\n\n\nGetting yourself to understand the detail necessary to make an informed choice on whom to approach is probably the hard part. Introverts survive deep in specialist niches. Leaving this exact niche because some \"shallow new guy\" blathers something about it being a good idea is a recipe for disaster. Make a solid case why this is a risk worth taking, and remember the risk is mostly on the specialist. Even though these niches are hard to find it is often smarter to try again somewhere else than to force things. If you did your job well up to here you can often get some very valuable guidance into more appropriate parts of the community. Resist the urge to ask for endorsement if it is not signaled.\n\nI'll just repeat: 1 in 10!\n\nHow many cases did you do already? Less than 5? That would in all likelihood make it a bad idea. Remember intros are generally careful, risk averse people operating in a complicated environment. It is easy to break stuff that won't be fixable for you.\n\n*People use networks differently - thus networks should look differently to different people. There is no one size fits all. MBTI is probably a good middle ground starting point.\n\n**The introverts can ask me for an \"introvert way to world domination\" - which I know they won't.", "created_at": "2017-11-28 19:47:08.075058", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:31:38.053515", "tag_id": 1033, "post_id": 12141, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 4536}, {"id": 18535, "text": "", "quote": "Slo\u017een\u00ed vody, zne\u010di\u0161\u0165uj\u00edc\u00ed faktory, velice podrobn\u011b kolob\u011bh vody, monitoring vodn\u00edch zdroj\u016f, p\u00e9\u010de o vodu a management vody.", "created_at": "2020-02-18 13:51:27.942393", "updated_at": "2020-02-18 13:51:27.942393", "tag_id": 4209, "post_id": 57696, "creator_id": 4779, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 10482}, {"id": 18487, "text": "", "quote": "V\u011bt\u0161inou jsou tyhle kontakty p\u0159es zn\u00e1most, tak\u017ee tipuju,", "created_at": "2020-02-18 10:36:35.543064", "updated_at": "2020-02-18 10:36:35.543064", "tag_id": 4946, "post_id": 60432, "creator_id": 4779, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 10263}, {"id": 18536, "text": "", "quote": "A na Masarykov\u011b Univerzit\u011b koordinuju Horizon2020 projekt, kde budeme lidi vzd\u011bl\u00e1vat ohledn\u011b vody.

I am currently working for Leeuwarden-Frysl\u00e2n European Capital of Culture 2018 as part of the communication and marketing team, where I'm looking into setting up an online platform on which the communities surrounding our cultural programme can join forces and find eachother.

This box was the product of a very specific way to produce software as a product using \u201cwaterfall methodologies\u201d. In waterfall methods, you start with the requirements from the clients, once you have those, you go to your developer team and start turning those requirements into a specification and a design of a machine to be developed. This whole process was slow, like one or two years, and after that you would emerge and pass what you developed back to the client. You would test it with the client to see if it worked. And, ideally it all worked and you were done.Or, for example with Microsoft, every two to three years a new release of the operating system would be offered. They would go through a similar cycle for each version, and come back in 2-3 years with a new version of the operating system, or other software like Microsoft Office. Once it was ready, you would release the code and put it on a disk to get sold. Once code was released, changes were difficult, so that release date was a big moment and the end of a production cycle. Today, we do not buy boxes, but open up a browser window to access most software. We access Facebook, Google search or Google Docs, and a host of other \u201cservices\u201d instead of installing them on our computers. With services the code is on a server. The user connects to the server to get the functionality.

Is usually delegated to the patients the duty of providing the accurate information about their health condition every visit.\n\n\n\tThe missing digitalization of the gathered health data and the consequent discontinuity of the healing process.\n\n\n\tThe limited precision of the anamnestic research due to the high number of patients and the short time available.\n\n\n\n\n\tFinal User, individuals and\u00a0community target\n\n\n\n\nResQ is conceived to ease the communication among physicians (involved in critical context such as emergency hospitals and refugees reception centers) regarding the health state of foreigner patients who don\u2019t know the language of the hosting country.

Also, the digitalization of such a document would make possible an extensive sharing with colleagues that later will take care of the same patient.\n\nTherefore the physician will have the chance to communicate autonomously among themselves without misunderstanding through the management tool.\n\n\nResQ-board.jpg2045x2500 640 KB\n\n\n\n\n\n\tTechnologies we will adopt\n\n\n\n\nThe tool we are designing will be developed in order to be accessible from the main devices available on the market.

In waterfall methods, you start with the requirements from the clients, once you have those, you go to your developer team and start turning those requirements into a specification and a design of a machine to be developed. This whole process was slow, like one or two years, and after that you would emerge and pass what you developed back to the client. You would test it with the client to see if it worked. And, ideally it all worked and you were done.Or, for example with Microsoft, every two to three years a new release of the operating system would be offered. They would go through a similar cycle for each version, and come back in 2-3 years with a new version of the operating system, or other software like Microsoft Office. Once it was ready, you would release the code and put it on a disk to get sold. Once code was released, changes were difficult, so that release date was a big moment and the end of a production cycle.

They would be innovative, fairly priced and an integral part of their local community. They would be great places to work, and run for the benefit of all, not to maximize profit or subject to the whims of governments. That\u2019s our dream.\u00a0\nA bit of background: The care industry in the UK is in crisis (the BBC recently called it the problem no one can fix). \u00a0It is a familiar story.\u00a0 The demand for care is growing rapidly due mainly to an ageing population, with increasingly complex conditions, a breaking down of traditional community-provided care, and higher expectations amongst the elderly.\nAt the same time, the ability of government-funded institutions to meet those needs is diminishing. They lack the resources, the responsiveness and the political will to deal with the population\u2019s increasingly complex care needs.\nAt the same, escalating asset prices are putting pressure on traditional providers, and attracting hedge funds and private equity looking for the \"growth opportunities\u201d. \u00a0The result is that many care home are being run as a businesses more than as a service, meaning that profit and shareholder value is prioritised over the needs and well-being of residents or staff.\nCaring for Life is a diverse team has come together to seek a better solution. We are inspired by:\n\nopen source communities, that harness collective intelligence to find new solutions to old problems;\nnetworked organisations, notably Buurtzorg, the community care provider in the Netherlands, that combine the benefits of being small with the benefits of being part of something large.\ntraditional community-based approaches to care-giving that are human-centred and sustainable.\n\nWe intend to will achieve this in particular by taking over existing care home businesses and creating, one-by-one, a network of homes modelling the type of care we want to see. \u00a0Once we have established a small number of our own homes, we will reach out to other like-minded operators to create a broader community of homes around the UK.\nA key operating principle will be to involve all \"stakeholders\".\u00a0 Buurtzorg (mentioned above) has an excellent model, illustrating the various levels of involvement, and whilst this is primarily looking at home care as opposed to care homes, it is a useful way of viewing the bigger picture.\nCare home residents come into care with social networks, habits, routines and pastimes, which are normally stripped away on entering care. As far as possible these should be maintained because these are part of the person's \"support system\". Involving the family and friends as well as the wider community will, whilst it may add to the complexity, lighten the burden of care and increase quality of life for all affected.\nLegal structure:\u00a0 Our intention is to separate out the capital assets from the business of caring. The precise legal structure remains to be worked out but may be similar to a so-called community land trust (see http://www.communitylandtrusts.org.uk/what-is-a-clt/about-clts) where one organisation (maybe a charity) owns the freehold of the land and a social enterprise runs the care home. \u00a0There would be some element of employee ownership, which has been shown in many businesses to encourage higher than average levels of productivity and profitability.\nGetting started:\u00a0 Our intent is to start by acquiring control of one care home.\u00a0 In order to keep capital needs as low as possible in the early stages, the intention is to lease premises on a long-term lease rather than buying a home. An opportunity has been identified near the south coast of England and conversations have started with the owners.\u00a0 This is an interesting opportunity, in particular because there is an chance to acquire the property and business for a low price.\u00a0 The home is currently subject to \"special measures\u201d, imposed by the Care Quality Commission.", "created_at": "2017-01-22 18:59:45", "updated_at": "2017-01-22 18:59:45", "tag_id": 770, "post_id": 758, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 725}, {"id": 17445, "text": "", "quote": "ur 'community of fate' being very much tied to land and rituals.", "created_at": "2019-11-15 17:17:09.183876", "updated_at": "2019-11-15 17:17:09.183876", "tag_id": 1060, "post_id": 64137, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 9369}, {"id": 19267, "text": "", "quote": "how SARS-COV-2 is affecting the evolution of the Internet.", "created_at": "2020-05-25 15:34:46.327949", "updated_at": "2020-05-25 15:34:46.327949", "tag_id": 5309, "post_id": 76784, "creator_id": 5059, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 13564}, {"id": 19278, "text": "", "quote": "many large tech companies are reporting record profits, and have been able to use this momentum to further consolidate market share.", "created_at": "2020-05-25 15:44:13.107165", "updated_at": "2020-05-25 15:44:13.107165", "tag_id": 3816, "post_id": 76784, "creator_id": 5059, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 13564}, {"id": 19282, "text": "", "quote": "With more of us reliant on technology for our daily lives than ever before,", "created_at": "2020-05-26 14:46:35.904991", "updated_at": "2020-05-26 14:46:35.904991", "tag_id": 5316, "post_id": 76784, "creator_id": 5059, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 13564}, {"id": 19286, "text": "", "quote": "It is not just their sizable battle chests that leaves Big Tech so well positioned in this current crisis.", "created_at": "2020-05-26 14:55:59.439401", "updated_at": "2020-05-26 14:55:59.439401", "tag_id": 3816, "post_id": 76784, "creator_id": 5059, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 13564}, {"id": 19281, "text": "", "quote": "that the pandemic, as it ravaged so many human lives and endeavors, has strengthened large tech companies.", "created_at": "2020-05-25 15:47:59.185110", "updated_at": "2020-05-26 15:26:59.078896", "tag_id": 5327, "post_id": 76784, "creator_id": 5059, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 13564}, {"id": 19301, "text": "", "quote": "Annette\u2019s current work explores the ethics and politics of algorithmic decision-making, machine learning and artificial intelligence.", "created_at": "2020-05-27 14:25:42.930397", "updated_at": "2020-05-27 14:25:42.930397", "tag_id": 4282, "post_id": 75832, "creator_id": 5209, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 13438}, {"id": 19276, "text": "", "quote": "Where most sectors of the economy have seen demand collapse,", "created_at": "2020-05-25 15:43:47.390978", "updated_at": "2020-08-27 14:34:50.338680", "tag_id": 5156, "post_id": 76784, "creator_id": 5059, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 13564}, {"id": 19284, "text": "", "quote": "But will it turn out to be a temporary respite for the internet giants, or are we witnessing a more permanent concentration of power over yet more aspects of our society and economy?", "created_at": "2020-05-26 14:48:29.647547", "updated_at": "2020-09-11 14:45:51.372133", "tag_id": 1167, "post_id": 76784, "creator_id": 5059, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 13564}, {"id": 26878, "text": "", "quote": "Also, the Dutch State did not comply with its duty of transparancy.", "created_at": "2020-11-14 11:33:21.576666", "updated_at": "2020-11-14 11:33:21.576666", "tag_id": 7516, "post_id": 86662, "creator_id": 5479, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 14766}, {"id": 26930, "text": "", "quote": "Service providers can improve the software using this feedback, and in the process also optimize users behavior towards a certain direction.

These medical camps are led by Nepalese professionals who are assisted by qualified volunteers and medical and dentistry students from the UK.\n\nThe long and expensive journey to the hospitals in Laksha and Kathmandu (sometimes taking days) are out-of-reach for the majority living in these low-income communities. Their main source of income is from subsistence farming and small profits are often shared throughout the community. So as you can imagine, when word gets out that these clinics are nearby, villagers flock to them in the hope of securing a cure for their health issues.\n\n\u00a0There are currently no permanent doctors in the region, which is home to a large, ethnically diverse population, spread over a number of rural communities made up of low income households. People lack access to basic health care and specialist treatment and have to walk for many days to attend the nearest hospital or else take the long and expensive journey to Kathmandu. The medical camps provide free consultation, treatment and advice from specialist qualified doctors as well as access to free medication.\u00a0The goal is to one day provide the communities in these remote Himalayan villages with permanent medical care and qualified staff, rather than a temporary clinic run from an outbuilding of Bupsa\u2019s monastery.\n\nThe group that started the initiative were limited to leftover equipment from the previous clinics\u00a0and a small amount of supplies that they carried in with them.\u00a0 One of the most common problems witnessed were musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). MSDs are a widely spread problem facing porters and farming communities who endure hard physical labour day-in-day-out. Muscles, joints, tendons, ligaments and nerves can all be affected, causing discomfort to intense pain. The reduction of these disorders caused through employment is a key objective of the EU through its Community Strategy, proving just how fortunate we are to benefit from\u00a0accessible healthcare.\n\nRead the full story here: \u00a0http://wildernessmedicinemagazine.com/article.asp?id=1026\n\n\n  \n    mmtrust.wordpress.com\n  \n  \n    \n\nWilderness Medicine in Nepal\n\nMoving Mountains runs small and mobile medical camps in the remote villages of Bumburi and Bupsa, along with the surrounding villages in the Solu-Khumbu region of the Nepalese Himalayas.

If you\u2019re on the freeway, and there\u2019s a traffic jam, Waze can recommend an alternate route. Waze then will say \u201cOkay, get off the freeway, I\u2019ll push you through the surface roads, so that you can get from A to B faster.\u201d In doing so, they\u2019re claiming to optimize the time to travel for the users. But what they\u2019re also doing is that by optimizing your path by putting you through surface roads, they are actually causing more congestion. What they\u2019re doing is putting more traffic onto roads that cannot deal with that kind of congestion. If only a few users do this, they are doing well. But if a lot of users start doing this, you actually increase congestion for everyone. This is something traffic engineers have called the price of anarchy.Waze basically keeps its users, by promising them the ability to optimize their path. Time to travel from A to B. It optimizes all of its services, so that the users are happy and if the user base grows, it has more location data from people, which can then be used to build new services and overall, keep investors happy.In services like Waze, the app is the product of layers and layers of managerial and mathematical forms of optimization. And, at the same time, the app helps optimize asocial selfish driver behavior while congesting surface roads, increasing congestion overall, causing extra traffic expenses for municipalities that now have to deal with hundreds of cars using small roads, increasing accidents, etc. Waze and other optimization systems do not \u201cknow\u201d things, but sense the world and give information to users in order to co-create new geographies and behaviors for the extraction of value.

Everybody except the very, very rich.\n\nHowever, we opened this garden in a situation of conflict, an object lesson for everybody on gentrification and the ruthlessness of real estate speculation: we did not put the politics into it, they did, and everybody has learned the lesson.\n\nCommunities can be built on imagining the past, children help us to imagine the future together and learn to build solidarity - we love our place and its history, but anybody from\u00a0Senegal or from\u00a0Germany who also loves them is welcome;\u00a0\n\nIn this context, we do small things with major implications, for example:\n\n- markets where parents give and take children's clothes for free, which teaches one enormously important things about the wastefulness of our society;\n\n\nviolin lessons, chess\u00a0and opera singing because we believe that \"beautiful\",\"elegant\" and \"difficult\" things should not be the monopoly of a financial elite;\nthe only free football school in Florence, thanks to the unique Lebowski football team;\nattempting to revive the dying crafts of Florence and discover the history of our district, with all its tremendous historical implications;\nwe are trying to find a way to set up a cooperative to give work to the many families who have skills, but are being driven off the job market;\nwe are beginning to develop more sustainable ways of consumption, in a gradual way that everybody can understand, also thanks to the fact that we have a child's birthday party nearly every day in our garden!

It can't be skipped. As I am talking to extrovert community managers**, you need to start with finding an introvert. This will be hard for many of you because the last time you saw one is \"the unpopular kid\" in school. After this compulsory community, most strong extros mingle with other strong extros - and intros almost vanish from their life as it is awkward to have one between 8 other extros. Imagine the unpopular kid did not vanish, but once in a while checked your social network accounts in the last couple of years, and just shook his/her head at what you were doing. How misguided. How superficial. Most of the intros time however went into building self esteem over (failed attempts at) solving some ridiculously complicated, almost impossible problem.\n\nHow do you find this person? It is hard. You can look through your network all you want - it is full of other extros. And they are isolated. Especially, the powerful and strong intros. What are you to do? Ring random doorbells? Not quite, but searching for activities that would attract introverts may help (certain music or movies are a strong cue if they apply to your culture). In short: Go where other people (especially you and your friends) don't like to go, and see who is there. Listen and watch for weak signals. Another method would be to bring a couple of your extrovert friends to a relatively random crowd, and then be very extrovert in everyone's face. The ones that are running away are the ones you're looking for.\n\nThis can be easier and usually much faster to do on/with the internet. Actually, if you end up in a place that you don't understand, and people behave strangely - chances are you stumbled upon a community of mild intros. The strong introvert is like a Yeti. It leaves big footsteps but is rarely seen in person. \n\nSometimes a mild intro may be the gatekeeper of one or more strong intros. Thus getting to the real powerful connections is always a two step process. First you have to win trust and show you can engage an intro on their terms. Then you get into their sanctum. Having intro-respected people who will vow for your integrity makes things easier as you progress. But remember, you are in a different ecosystem that has different requirements and different dynamics. Okay, this was long - because you have to get it right or there is no point.\n\n\nIf you have an issue and found your introvert, you will have to find out this introverts needs. For that you'll have to understand in quite some detail what he/she is trying to achieve. Then discuss or observe how the work is conducted. If you can think of ways to improve the workflow you could carefully put them on the table, mostly to watch why and how they will be declined. Assume an intro will be too shy to tell you about the real motivation, so watch for weak signals on that. Networking / collaboration opportunities to be may be be ignored (often because they don't mix with the work mode). Carefully feel around why each opportunity is not taken, and let the explanations stand for now. We'll come to the emotional commitment in point 4.\nThe \"without breaking it\" part is crucial. I have done and attended quite a bit of interviews with conventional main stream media on scientific topics. Almost without fail, they disfigure the message - not seldom making exactly the mistake you explicitly implored them not to do. Less mainstream media (introvert niches) usually fares better. In the age of exact copy&paste or digital recording options this can be improved a lot. Just make sure whatever happens, the original detailed data can be quickly found, and you find a combination of cat pictures (transmission) and differential equations (reception) you can both live with.\nIf you got this far you already have a decent chance at this part. Unfortunately introverts are pretty diverse on some fronts (and blindingly simple on some others) so tread carefully initially. Chances are, if you come across as informed and sincere, and the other intro you have in tow is compatible, the emotional commitment part is not going to be difficult for you. It'll be more difficult for you to believe someone will have a emotional reaction to such a complicated concept.\n\n\nGetting yourself to understand the detail necessary to make an informed choice on whom to approach is probably the hard part. Introverts survive deep in specialist niches. Leaving this exact niche because some \"shallow new guy\" blathers something about it being a good idea is a recipe for disaster. Make a solid case why this is a risk worth taking, and remember the risk is mostly on the specialist. Even though these niches are hard to find it is often smarter to try again somewhere else than to force things. If you did your job well up to here you can often get some very valuable guidance into more appropriate parts of the community. Resist the urge to ask for endorsement if it is not signaled.\n\nI'll just repeat: 1 in 10!\n\nHow many cases did you do already? Less than 5? That would in all likelihood make it a bad idea. Remember intros are generally careful, risk averse people operating in a complicated environment. It is easy to break stuff that won't be fixable for you.\n\n*People use networks differently - thus networks should look differently to different people. There is no one size fits all.

How can you as community manager get in touch with new Edgeryders? You go to their user profile, look for the Contact tab and write them a direct message which goes into their email box (more). Simply say hi and introduce yourself, or tell them about the latest that\u2019s happening; it also helps if you make a connection with a topic they seem to be interested in based on their user profile. This is probably the most routine work in the community management, but highly rewarding when it pays off -\u00a0people stay involved and enjoy\u00a0being part of a community of like minded peers.\n\nChecklist: Nurture conversations\n\nPaying attention to what others are saying is crucial because it tells\u00a0the most about who the community members are and what they are interested in. A big part of community management is to nurture conversations: by reading and commenting what Edgeryders are saying, encouraging a diversity of voices, and fostering a culture of respectful, meaningful interaction.\u00a0\n\nNB: My personal opinion is that\u00a0the risk here is to become\u00a0an automatic\u00a0voice. Being a community manager\u00a0doesn't make us robots or call center operators, we're still biased and\u00a0opinionated\u00a0humans. Hence some things get us more excited than others, and we can choose to\u00a0comment or highlight certain efforts more than others. Same with trolls, you can feed them or not.\u00a0\n\nOn empathy: I find being empathetic towards what other people are saying is key in developing good relationships in general, and in communities. This means prioritizing what they are feeling and cultivating a behavior by which we are wary of making any sort of assumptions about why they say certain things (read more).\n\nMany community members share common interests and although the platform is designed to increase serendipitous encounters, they can still miss each other. The good thing to do is, whenever you know people are doing similar things, invite them into conversations whenever key content could be interesting for them,\u00a0or directly introduce them to each other on twitter, facebook etc. As a community manager, you'll get to know most of people's social handles, so this will come easy to you.\n\nChecklist: Synthesize, Curate, Engage!\n\nI don\u2019t know if this is part of the professional community manager\u2019s job, but Edgeryders is entirely volunteer driven and the more we teach ourselves to work with content aka communicate properly, community managers and not only, the better! Sharing information and latest about what Edgeryders are doing is key, and it can be done mostly through periodic blog posts or platform posts in various relevant groups, and through our mailing list and social media.. Communicating and articulating thoughts in writing and also in public/for larger audiences is key to:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nConveying our values, our work, our successes: eg through curation \u201ca form of pattern recognition \u2013 pieces of information or insight which over time amount to an implicit point of view\u201d \u2013 says one of my favourite writers\u00a0Maria Popova \n\nTip: never assume everybody follows what\u2019s happening in the community. We need to re-package & summarize content all the time, even if it may seem obsolete.\n\n\n\nGathering and making use of relevant resources online: an additional challenge is to\u00a0communicate\u00a0in an engaging style, one that prompts responses and enthusiasm among fellow Edgeryders and triggers collaboration.\n\nTip: the simplest structure when writing for engagement can be:\n\na. What is the context or perspective from which you are writing the post?\n\nb. What challenge are you trying to solve/ what do you intend to achieve with the post?\n\nc. What are the steps to get started?\n\nd. Call to action: what do you want those reading the post to do? What action should they take in order to support you?\n\n\nChecklist: Basic admin work\n\nTo be more effective as an online community managers we all need to use our web platform as efficient as possible, meaning we can learn to make use of functionalities which ease the process of getting in touch with others and getting information or updates across. This goes beyond becoming a proficient platform user (by pinging Edgeryders, creating tasks and other things in the user\u2019s manual), and also involves putting up blocks, content editing & clean up when needed. If you become an Edgeryders community manager, we\u2019ll get you admin powers and make sure someone in the developers\u2019 team can give you a crash course in deploying basic Drupal platform features.\n\nSPOTLIGHT: Edgesense\n\nEdgesense is our own tool for social network analysis making it easier to detect emergent social dynamics. It is essentially a dashboard allowing community managers and anyone interested to monitor network growth in terms of number of users (nodes), relationships (edges) and specialized subcommunities (modularity) over time. You can start by testing it with the interactive tutorial, read: crash course in network analysis and concepts.\n\nEdgesense has been initiated by @Alberto & the Wikitalia team under CATALYST.\n\nRead more about it in its own platform group here and about the techs behind it on GitHub\n\n.  The Edgeryders network on the 8th of July, 2014\n\nChecklist: Social media outreach\n\nAgain, this is not entirely relevant to community management, but it is useful to learn especially when working with limited resources and when almost everyone involved in maintaining the ER infrastructure\u00a0needs to step in and help cover the need. It involves basic usage of personal (and optionally official ER channels)\u00a0facebook, twitter and other social media and turning them into community engagement channels: posting relevant updates especially focused on what\u2019s happening with the community, what people are working on and what individual Edgeryders have achieved lately! Highlighting members' efforts is an advice I've been given a lot (thanks Dorotea!) and we need to get ever better at acknowledging individual efforts. Luckily, a Social Media team is here to help, but not surprisingly, this too needs (re)activation and\u00a0constant inspiration\u00a0\n\nNeeded skills\n\nA genuinely friendly attitude and empathy (see above): that\u2019s pretty much all you need to get started in community management. The rest can be learned and you\u2019d be surprised of how intuitive it all is. We're all social beings after all.\n\nWhat you get out of it\n\nSome of the perks of volunteering to do Edgeryders community management are the following:\n\n\n\n\nYou become an expert in online communities and really understand the social dynamics behind them: put that on your resume or on LinkedIn. Plus,\u00a0Edgeryders the social enterprise or fellow community members can give you a recommendation!\n\n\nBy developing interpersonal relationships with others and evolving into a highly respected member in the community\u00a0you get to grow your own social capital and a\u00a0global network\n\n\nYou get to\u00a0be an empowered online platform user &\u00a0learn basic Drupal tweaks (beginner level, yet it feels empowering!), but most importantly, you become\u00a0proficient in online collaboration: a much needed skill in the times we're living.\n\nCould be your future \"job\"!\n\nCommunity management is definitely among the buzz words in the labour market today, alongside other interesting and similar \"jobs\" (should we still be interested to think in terms of jobs):\n\nNetwork weaver: is someone who is aware of the networks around them and explicitly works to make them healthier. They do this by helping people identify their interests and challenges, connecting people strategically where there\u2019s potential for mutual benefit, and serving as a catalyst for self-organizing groups. (source)\n\nCatalyst: nurture and care for the company's inner spirit, provoke new ways of thinking, and motivate and inspire\n\nVP of Happiness: keep the people happy, sing to them when they\u2019re down (for more funny names\u00a0see Job Titles of the Future)\n\nCybrarian!\u00a0nurture the community memory, pointing newcomers to archives, providing links to related conversations\u200b (by @hrheingold/the-art-of-hosting-good-online-conversations-38c6d06642d0#.ohklbnbgl\">Howard Rheinghold)\n\nMore readingsOn online community management\n\nPrinciples of Cyberspace Innkeeping, a book written by the legendary John Coate (a member of Edgeryders too!):\n\nThe currency is human attention.

You don\u2019t automatically throw a great party by hiring a room and buying some beer. Someone needs to invite an interesting mix of people, greet people at the door, make introductions, start conversations, avert fisticuffs, encourage people to let their hair down and entertain each other.\n\n\nA host is also an authority. The host is the person who enforces whatever rules there may be, and will therefore be seen by many as a species of law enforcement officer.\n\n\nA host is also an exemplar. Good hosts model the behavior they want others to emulate: read carefully and post entertainingly, informatively, and economically, acknowledge other people by name, assume good will, assert trust until convinced otherwise\u00a0, add knowledge, offer help\u00a0, be slow to anger, apologize when wrong, politely ask for clarification, exercise patience when your temper flares.\n\n\nA host is also a cybrarian. Good hosts nurture the community memory, pointing newcomers to archives, providing links to related conversations, past and present, hunting down resources to add to the collective pool of knowledge \u2014 and teaching others to do it. Well performed voluntary cybrarianship is contagious.\n\n\nA host can be a character in the show, but the show is collaborative improvisation, with the audience onstage.\n\n\nAll hosts are members of a community of hosts. You can\u2019t host communities without communities of hosts.\n\n\n\nThe article in full can be read\u00a0@hrheingold/the-art-of-hosting-good-online-conversations-38c6d06642d0#.ohklbnbgl\">here.\n\nAn Abecedarium For Community Management, by\u00a0Meg Pickard\n\n\nSource\n\nAlso see:\n\nThe Virtual Community, by Howard Rheingold\n\nThe Network Weaver Handbook by June Holley\n\nAdvanced Social Sciences for Community Builders,\u00a0Ning talk\u00a0\n\nNoemi\u2019s Pinterest board on Communities & Storytelling\n\nWhat we are learning about building communities from our members and projects\n\nAn attempt to gather here important reflections from the life of our community.\n\nBuilding a shared vision of Edgeryders, results of a community survey, end of 2013\n\nQuakes create movements, but can we?, reflections of building an online community of alternative leaders in post-earthquake Nepal, 2015\n\nSpot the Future Bucharest, an open report after two months of online/offline community building in Romania, 2015\n\nOn compensating community members' efforts, a discussion about using MakerFox for network barters\n\nContribute to developing an Edgeryders healthy communication culture, a\u00a0wiki you are most welcome to contribute to!\n\nGet in touch\n\nIf you want to learn more about online community building and want to help Edgeryders thrive, get in touch.

Unique experiment of nature, kind, sweet, cheerful, positive, charismatic, did I mention good looking? I have a couple of certificates\u2026\u2026and so on\u2026 curious and creative, eager to learn, to travel, have fun\u2026\n\n\u00a0 I live in Serbia, the Balkans, reason enough to be interested in current events in the world and region. Turbulent past, dynamic present and an uncertain future, burdensome by intolerance and conflicts in the region, which I personally found not only unnecessary but also totally crazy, because we all have the same desires and dreams, to live freely, love unconditionally, have fun, learn, be independent, travel, have amazing adventures, the best parties \u2026. without regard to national and religious affiliation, skin color, eye color\u2026 there are too many prejudice, inequality, unprotected and vulnerable people, there is gender inequality, intolerance, social injustice, poverty, hunger, disease, non-existent or inadequate health care, problems of refugees, racism\u2026. I do not know why and I`m trying to understand. Injustice affects me terribly. We learn history in order to avoid the mistakes which were made and were pretty catastrophic, and to me it seems like we constantly repeat the same errors. I have learned not to judge in advance, that all deserve respect, a smile, a kind word, that the mind is like a parachute works only if it is open, that in the period of globalization, IT progress, revolutionary discoveries, scientific achievements, robotics, nanotechnology \u2026 we must not think about limits, all barriers and borders exists\u00a0 only in our heads., I perfectly understand what it means conflict, and detest it, I hate arguing, hate conflicts. I watch the news, read a newspaper and follow social networks and\u00a0 I can say there is too much violence, too much suffering, too much of everything negative, the constant threat of war, terrorism\u2026just too much. I want a better world, a better society, a better life for all, it is important to take care of others, to be open-minded. I want more, I need more, no one should be afraid for ones lives, children must not be hungry, barefoot, on the streets, women must not be abused, people should not be expelled from their homes, the world gone crazy and we desperately need all people of good will who want and have the knowledge and strength to fight, not only to philosophize and criticize, but also commit to work, to improve our society, day after day, devotedly\u2026\n\nThey tell us that as individuals we cant do anything, at least anything important, that we are still small, young and inexperienced, but adults forget, and sometimes reduces our value, ignored it, forget it under the weight of today circumstances. We are thirsty for knowledge and education, we might be weak, but snowflakes are gentle and weak until they connect, then they become strong. We need to connect, as snowflakes, the youth of the region and the world, only united we can be strong, important, perhaps adults hear us and listen. When children quarrel, they quickly reconcile because its not important to be right, but to be happy. We should accept that we do not have to agree on everything, sometimes can agree to disagree, but we have to respects others' way of life, other people's opinion, that we can discuss about everything, not argue, talking in order to generate ideas, information, positive energy..

Good neighborly relations like friendship and trust builds, slowly and gradually, all that is good and valuable in life, takes time. First we need to forgive.

Attraverso un processo di ricerca abbiamo evidenziato come un approccio olistico, che a colpo d\u2019occhio fornisca un quadro clinico completo, comporterebbe indubbi vantaggi a medici e pazienti.\n\n1.2 Acquisizione di idee, spunti, intuizioni\n\nLo spunto iniziale che ha dato l\u2019avvio al progetto \u00e8 scaturito da una serie di interviste condotte tra medici e pazienti. Questi ultimi in particolare lamentavano la scarsa preparazione del medico rispetto al loro specifico caso clinico, delegando pertanto al paziente stesso, la responsabilit\u00e0 nel fornire informazioni dettagliate circa la patologia da affrontare.\n\n1.3 Definizione del problema\n\nIl problema che abbiamo affrontato pu\u00f2 essere definito come una carenza di comunicazione. I diversi professionisti della cura non possiedono, ad oggi, uno strumento semplice e veloce che possa tenerli aggiornati rispetto alla progressione clinica di ogni loro paziente. Le informazioni sanitarie sono disgregate e appartengono allo specialista che le ha prodotte attraverso la propria visita. Queste informazioni tendenzialmente non hanno altro modo di essere condivise, se non attraverso il paziente stesso, cui si delega il compito e la responsabilit\u00e0 di fornire tali informazioni allo specialista successivo.\n\nDoc.doc si propone essenzialmente come un aggregatore di informazioni, un unico database medico nel quale possano essere convogliati e organizzati i dati dei pazienti che si hanno in cura. In questo modo il medico pu\u00f2 affrontare ogni nuova visita avendo gi\u00e0 chiara l\u2019anamnesi pregressa del paziente in questione. Doc.doc inoltre fornisce tutti i contatti degli specialisti che hanno condotto una determinata visita in precedenza, e rende estremamente semplice (un clic) la possibilit\u00e0 di mettersi in contatto con un collega per richiedere un chiarimento o un parere rispetto ai dettagli di una certa una cartella clinica.\n\n2.0 Definizione\n\n2.1 Analisi delle soluzioni\n\nIn seguito ad una estesa sessione di una particolare forma di brainstorming, il brainwriting, sono stati vagliati diversi possibili approcci per affrontare il tema proposto dal bando OpenCare. Questi sono stati categorizzati in modo sistematico secondo la tecnica detta delle 4Cs (le quattro\u201dc\u201d: components, characteristics, challenges, characters) e quindi circoscritti in macro-aree che puntavano ad un certo specifico orientamento verso la risoluzione delle problematiche riscontrate in ambito sanitario.\n\n2.2 Ideazione del concept\n\nIn seguito ai risultati scaturiti dalle tecniche di brainstorming, \u00e8 stato realizzato un questionario da sottoporre ad un certo numero di pazienti, parenti dei pazienti e professionisti della cura (non solo medici, ma anche infermieri, farmacisti, fisioterapisti etc\u2026).\n\nQueste interviste si sono rivelate cruciali nel definire il percorso che doc.doc avrebbe intrapreso.\n\nInfatti, abbiamo riscontrato presso la maggior parte dei pazienti intervistati, una sostanziale insoddisfazione riguardo i processi di comunicazione con i propri medici. In particolare, nel caso di patologie particolarmente complesse, dove \u00e8 necessario il coinvolgimento di molteplici specialisti, spesso i medici coinvolti sono parzialmente o totalmente all\u2019oscuro riguardo i progressi dei colleghi nei confronti di uno specifico aspetto nella cura della patologia. La comunicazione di queste informazioni, avviene, ma quasi esclusivamente per mezzo del paziente, il quale \u00e8 costretto ad assumersi la piena responsabilit\u00e0 dell\u2019accuratezza e completezza delle informazioni fornite.\n\n2.3 Proposta della soluzione\n\nIn seguito alla ricerca svolta, \u00e8 stato quindi logico cominciare a pensare alla progettazione di uno strumento gestionale che permettesse ai medici di avere immediatamente disponibili tutte le informazioni concernente un certo paziente, comprese le informazioni di contatto dei colleghi responsabili di una certa visita.\n\nAbbiamo cos\u00ec progettato uno strumento gestionale che facilita l\u2019organizzazione degli appuntamenti di un medico, ordina in maniera chiara le cartelle cliniche dei pazienti per tipologia e cronologia, permette in un clic di contattare un collega tramite telefono, chat o email, infine rende pi\u00f9 efficiente la visita stessa poich\u00e9 doc.doc consente al medico curante di aggiornarsi circa i progressi del proprio paziente nei minuti precedenti alla visita.\n\nDoc.doc infatti pu\u00f2 essere programmato per concedere uno spazio di tempo (tendenzialmente 10 minuti) tra una visita e l\u2019altra, che permetta al medico di prendere visione della cartella clinica del paziente che sta per incontrare.\n\n3.0 Sviluppo\n\n3.1 Progettazione e prova del prototipo\n\nDoc.doc allo stato attuale consiste in un prototipo interattivo realizzato attraverso la piattaforma proto.io.\n\nPrima di ottenere questo risultato abbiamo sostenuto una approfondita analisi UX che ci ha consentito di effettuare scelte precise circa lo sviluppo di certe funzionalit\u00e0.\u00a0In particolare, attraverso tecniche di Brainwriting e alcune empathy map abbiamo circoscritto l\u2019ambito di lavoro.\n\nA seguito di alcune interviste di orientamento con pazienti e professionisti sanitari abbiamo definito ulteriormente gli obiettivi del progetto, concentrandoci su una \u201cone primary task\u201d, che nel caso di doc.doc consiste nell\u2019aggregazione semplificata dei dati di ogni paziente. Considerando quindi alcuni ipotetici scenari di utilizzo del nostro servizio (presso specialisti\u00a0o medici di base, in studio o in visita a domicilio etc\u2026) abbiamo sviluppato una prima logica di user flow e infine la sua realizzazione grafica interattiva, della quale si pu\u00f2 avere una tangibile esperienza d\u2019uso qui: http://bit.ly/2oOXbmK (una volta scaricata l'intera\u00a0cartella \u00e8 sufficiente aprire il file index.html con il proprio browser, meglio se Chrome).\n\nInoltre in seguito allo sviluppo del prototipo \u00e8 stato condotto un piccolo usability testing\u00a0che ha evidenziato piccole problematiche, immediatamente risolte con il rilascio della versione successiva, di cui si pu\u00f2 prendere visione al link sopracitato.\n\n3.2\u00a0Prova della fruibilit\u00e0\n\nE\u2019 stato condotto un piccolo usability testing, parzialmente moderato, che ha sostanzialmente confermato tutti gli obiettivi di usabilit\u00e0 stabiliti a monte. In particolare i nostri utenti test sono stati, per la maggior parte, in grado di portare a termine le operazioni richieste, quali: 1. Consultare una cartella clinica, 2. Consultare la rubrica pazienti e professionisti, 3. Aggiungere un nuovo appuntamento, 4. Contattare un collega. In questa fase abbiamo ritenuto prematuro considerare ulteriore metriche di controllo oggettive quali tempi e statistiche di errore, concentrandoci piuttosto su misurazioni di gradimento soggettive e mantenendo come unico conteggio obiettivo il numero di operazioni portate a buon fine.\n\nSono stati riscontrati alcuni problemi nella fruibilit\u00e0 dei dati della cartella clinica e delle funzionalit\u00e0 ad essa collegate (\u00e8 infatti possibile anche iniziare una conversazione\u00a0con un collega). L\u2019organizzazione dei contenuti di quella determinata schermata \u00e8 stata quindi modificata sulla base dei feedback ricevuti, cos\u00ec come l\u2019intero look&feel dell\u2019applicazione \u00e8 stato rivisto coerentemente rispetto alle modifiche apportate.\n\n4.0 Rilascio\n\n4.1 Completamento del prodotto/servizio\n\nIl prototipo \u00e8 gi\u00e0 stato testato, ma andrebbe ulteriormente verificato su un campione pi\u00f9 esteso di utenti, seguito eventualmente da un A/B testing.\n\nConclusa la fase di usability testing sul prototipo, si proceder\u00e0 quindi con lo sviluppo di programmazione vero e proprio, la\u00a0cui funzionalit\u00e0\u00a0verr\u00e0\u00a0verificata\u00a0ad ogni milestone raggiunta.\n\nInfine, verranno concepite strategie di distribuzione, idealmente con il coinvolgimento delle ASL locali, per permettere un capillare ed effettivo utilizzo del servizio.\n\n4.2 Rilascio finale\n\nE\u2019 in fase di definizione una timeline di sviluppo che presenti le milestone necessarie al completamento del prodotto, secondo specifiche tempistiche.\n\n4.3 Produzione\n\nIl team di sviluppo tecnico \u00e8 ancora da definirsi, ma stiamo valutando una collaborazione con I-SEE\u00a0(http://www.i-seecomputing.com), specialisti nell produzione di software in ambito medico/ sanitario.", "created_at": "2017-11-26 21:04:17.892351", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:21:36.149708", "tag_id": 406, "post_id": 33729, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 6578}, {"id": 26955, "text": "", "quote": "a lot of the magic of data exploitation still happens once the data is your individual data is collected with like data of like 150,000, or like 100 or 2 million other people.

Unique experiment of nature, kind, sweet, cheerful, positive, charismatic, did I mention good looking? I have a couple of certificates\u2026\u2026and so on\u2026 curious and creative, eager to learn, to travel, have fun\u2026\n\n\u00a0 I live in Serbia, the Balkans, reason enough to be interested in current events in the world and region. Turbulent past, dynamic present and an uncertain future, burdensome by intolerance and conflicts in the region, which I personally found not only unnecessary but also totally crazy, because we all have the same desires and dreams, to live freely, love unconditionally, have fun, learn, be independent, travel, have amazing adventures, the best parties \u2026. without regard to national and religious affiliation, skin color, eye color\u2026 there are too many prejudice, inequality, unprotected and vulnerable people, there is gender inequality, intolerance, social injustice, poverty, hunger, disease, non-existent or inadequate health care, problems of refugees, racism\u2026. I do not know why and I`m trying to understand. Injustice affects me terribly. We learn history in order to avoid the mistakes which were made and were pretty catastrophic, and to me it seems like we constantly repeat the same errors. I have learned not to judge in advance, that all deserve respect, a smile, a kind word, that the mind is like a parachute works only if it is open, that in the period of globalization, IT progress, revolutionary discoveries, scientific achievements, robotics, nanotechnology \u2026 we must not think about limits, all barriers and borders exists\u00a0 only in our heads., I perfectly understand what it means conflict, and detest it, I hate arguing, hate conflicts. I watch the news, read a newspaper and follow social networks and\u00a0 I can say there is too much violence, too much suffering, too much of everything negative, the constant threat of war, terrorism\u2026just too much. I want a better world, a better society, a better life for all, it is important to take care of others, to be open-minded. I want more, I need more, no one should be afraid for ones lives, children must not be hungry, barefoot, on the streets, women must not be abused, people should not be expelled from their homes, the world gone crazy and we desperately need all people of good will who want and have the knowledge and strength to fight, not only to philosophize and criticize, but also commit to work, to improve our society, day after day, devotedly\u2026\n\nThey tell us that as individuals we cant do anything, at least anything important, that we are still small, young and inexperienced, but adults forget, and sometimes reduces our value, ignored it, forget it under the weight of today circumstances. We are thirsty for knowledge and education, we might be weak, but snowflakes are gentle and weak until they connect, then they become strong. We need to connect, as snowflakes, the youth of the region and the world, only united we can be strong, important, perhaps adults hear us and listen. When children quarrel, they quickly reconcile because its not important to be right, but to be happy. We should accept that we do not have to agree on everything, sometimes can agree to disagree, but we have to respects others' way of life, other people's opinion, that we can discuss about everything, not argue, talking in order to generate ideas, information, positive energy.. To find the solution for all problems and dilemmas, make projects, succeed.\n\nSomehow it feels despair and uncertainty it should not be so, we are young, we have desire and we can change everything that we do not like.\n\nIt is essential to connect, and I read that nothing brings people together as well as living a happy accident, if it is true, We, all\u00a0 in this region, the Balkans, we have more opportunities to be close, strong and organized than anyone else in the world, everything we've been through good and bad, sometimes on opposite sides, unfortunately, but we survived, war and killing, and we must never repeat it, we also\u00a0 sang and celebrated and rejoice together, it was perhaps more sadness and unhappiness, but if there is justice in life, in future we should have only lucky days, happiness. Good neighborly relations like friendship and trust builds, slowly and gradually, all that is good and valuable in life, takes time. First we need to forgive. Forgiveness is possible only with understanding, that is why this camp is super idea, to understand together what had happened, impartial, draw lessons from history, in order to continue, this time better, smarter.\n\nThe goal is to make the world a better and more humane place, sustainable, use space in the best possible way, with full respect of nature and population needs, because that's the point of studying, find the best way to reconcile nature and society to meet human needs, give vision of the future, the objectives of the future development.\n\nEverything is connected and the problems must be considered as a system, If one part of the system does not work properly, it reflects on other parts of the system", "created_at": "2017-11-26 21:05:08.813620", "updated_at": "2020-10-23 09:21:09.360553", "tag_id": 5999, "post_id": 854, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 821}, {"id": 12152, "text": "", "quote": "OpenVillage", "created_at": "2017-11-27 19:36:42.856063", "updated_at": "2017-12-02 16:05:37.333186", "tag_id": 2272, "post_id": 35931, "creator_id": 4180, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 6888}, {"id": 26953, "text": "", "quote": "I think in general, we put too much pressure on the individual to have to protect themselves and all sorts of areas of our lives, technology, internet, it's just one of them.

Also what works well is to set a clear invitation and some simple guidelines, such as the ones I described. They help the group process and give a certain structure to build up momentum.\u00a0My experiences have been diverse. I've experienced beautiful gatherings where love, depth and understanding were shared among all participants. Sometimes when the group was mixed deeply sharing also lead to some confusion as these depths were not familiar to everyone and not everyone seemed to grasp the depth of the experience of someone else. Although I think it didn't harm or shock anyone too much, I do think it may have lead to some confusion. For instance, I once went very deep receiving the talking stick and staying silent for a few minutes, all attention on me, I didn't want to \"just say something\" so I stayed present with my inner dynamics (and doubts) in front of everyone. Finally, I said something that felt true to me. So I remained connected to my inner truth. The woman who was sitting next to me didn't know how quick she had to say something when I gave her the talking stick. Ever since our contact between me and the woman have been somewhat weird. Coming to think of it, I should have probably talked to her sometime and exchange perspectives lightly....  (oops).\u00a0\n\nThis particular meeting was organized by a friend of mine btw and was a gathering of about 20 people, which is quite big for such a sharing. I'd say depending on the size of the group there will be different forms and formats that suit best the conversation. Not necessarily the bigger the group to more superficial. Groups can go very deep together when they are guided properly. This is a true art. And ideally, one question/ sharing leads to another, being able to deepen the conversation coming closer to opennings. And, maybe most importantly everything is good. So not resisting anything nor having an agenda helps for creating the space to be who you naturally are.\u00a0\n\nI believe the Circles of openness serve best around a certain theme that is loaded and which everyone has experiences with: I organized a series about money and I participated in one about sexuality. Both topics lead to a very vulnerable and warm sharing and brought everyone closer together. Also I think Circles work well for existing communities that work or live together, as tensions may arise during the daily practices. The latter I have some experiences with at the Synergyhub and the principle we used was to share from what's alive in you at the moment. This worked pretty well.\u00a0\n\nI also initiated a circle once during a workshop where people didn't really know each other and there wasn't a real theme or topic. In that setting it didn't feel really appropriate to do a sharing, as apart from being human and sharing a similar human experience (so there's always (some) interest), \u00a0there wasn't really a common intention or relevance to have this talk together. So I wouldn't organize a circle \"out of the blue\" again.\u00a0\n\nMost of the meetings I was with had both familiar people and strangers. As long as the intention for the meeting is clear, it's no problem and good examples will follow.\u00a0\n\nMost circles I went to lasted for about 1 to 2 hours. Although probably you know about retreats/ satsangs for instance with Bentinho Massaro that take about the whole day (with sessions of about 1,5 to 2 hours each). Have to say that during these days Bentinho (or some other \"teacher) is the one who does most of the talking. Yet, he knows how to bring a group into depth. So, even though it's a different form, there's also huge transformation happening during these meetings.\u00a0\n\n@Nadia about organizing this at The Reef. I would say a circle is very appropriate and effective if there is a theme or topic that has great interest. When this is the case, we can do it. You could also guide it yourself if you feel excited.\u00a0\n\nAnd is there a learning curve, @Noemi ? Yes, for me personally very much. Through sharing so openly in a public space among others really gave me confidence to be vulnerable and fully present. Also for many others I feel sharing with each other has this effect. During some of my meetings I really saw people transform, releasing some of the doubts and limiting beliefs they had about themselves! Truly magical to be there when that happens! Moments I have very exciting and warm memories of.\u00a0\n\nSo let me summarize my experiences:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nSharing from personal experiences - yet not getting caught up into the story. The aim is to gain clarity to let go of stories and have space te create the new.\u00a0\nCircles work well around certain (loaded) theme's and communities who work/ life together with a clear invitation.\u00a0\nListening from the heart, listening from beyond the personal perspective (not taking anything personal)\nEverything that pops up from a genuine sharing is welcome, even if it's off topic.

I\u2019m a keen cyclist for transport and leisure, but my profession is also research in devices enhancing the mobility for people with physical limitations. Therefore I feel an obligation to spread the news about recent advancements in cycling for physically challenged. Have you heard about FES cycling?\n\nFES - short for functional electrical stimulation - can be used to activate paralyzed muscles by impulses imitating the nervous system in the most natural way possible. We have come a long way with our research and it is possible to use this technique to let people with paralyzed legs cycle again. For some reason there are very few people who know about this so I\u2019d like to share this knowledge with you.\n\nWe cycle to move, but also to maintain fit. It can be both fun and functional. But, if your legs don't obey you anymore, you will probably not consider it a possibility. Paralyzed legs can result from an accident breaking your back, a stroke or a sneaking disease like the multiple sclerosis. \u00a0\n\nPeople caring for and curing you need to be very pragmatic, and you with them. Mobility then becomes reduced to passive transport, a dietetic approach to avoiding getting fat and medication of pressure sores and other side effects from lack of physical exercise. That\u2019s where the publicly unknown FES research comes into play. Years of clinical research have consolidated the benefits, but we need to spread the news and understand more about it. Some people may already have heard of handbikes. They allow you to cover greater distances than manual wheelchairs. They are special tricycles where you use the hands for pedaling.\n\nFES, on the other side, is applied via adhesive electrodes or incorporated in bicycle shorts. The stimulus activates the muscles of the buttocks and thighs in sync with the ride. \u00a0However only the leg muscles can challenge the cardiovascular system to get physically fit. Some people with for example spinal cord injury (paraplegia) may be able to use FES for activating these large muscles. \u00a0With FES cycling they can cover greater distances with greater speed and due to activation of large muscles they get (bene-)fit and feel physical well-being. The research community has tried to promote a more widespread use of FES cycling by arranging races (see here) and publications with the user's statements of the pros and cons\u00a0(see here).\n\n\nbb.jpg1122x520 409 KB\n\n\nHow can we build research into practice or at least make options much more accessible?\n\nThe question is how to help people who have become paraplegic or their families know about the existence of such possibilities. FES bikes are quite expensive so where to go to try them? Many places and cycle lanes are missing so it requires some changes to infrastructure as well. But as long as nobody uses them it's a vicious circle. Therefore we need more awareness to reduce cost, change infrastructure and increase inclusion in the cycle community\n\nEven handbikes which are more popular can\u2019t be bought in a normal bicycle shop, but rather directly from a few specialized companies. The lack of marketing incurs high costs to manufacturers and hence to clients.\n\nMy own group\u2019s response as research and practitioners is to create a culture to promote this change, a project in the making. How can we promote actual experience based dialogue between users (who are maybe hackers) and researchers? There is an international community of researchers, so there should be a good chance of of finding local experts. As someone with a disability, you could connect with them and hack - evolve - test collaboratively cheap functional solutions in a healthcare hacking space. Dr Fitzwater, who is both a researcher and FES cycler, reports on the need to make benefits enjoyable in addition to positive medical outcomes: \u201cThe FESC function should be capable of being used on the open road with or without friends and family and be easily usable without any more assistance than that already required for the activities of daily living\u201d.\n\nWhy should you, me or anyone care about the future of research? you want to see your tax money spent well, don\u2019t you? And most importantly, this could be you or a relative who would like to go for a ride and have drastically limited options.

In the context of \"Hacking Utopia\", a human centered design project at the University of Arts Berlin, we are investigating mental health. This article explains our approach of boosting mental resilience and give you the chance to get involved in our project.\n\nIn our previous contributions on Edgeryders we described how we started off with the question of making sadness, unproductivity and inefficiency less shameful. We discovered two TED talks that influenced us greatly: The power of vulnerability by Brene Brown and Depression, the secret we share by Andrew Solomon. As later confirmed by the psychologists we interviewed, these talks made us understand that sharing our feelings is a key step towards mental resilience. Establishing a sustainable, personal connection this is necessary for recovery and growth. When we hide our condition, we ignore it, it becomes worse.\n\nUSER INTERVIEWS\n\nThe issue of mental health is especially important in the context of youth. Young adults are increasingly affected by issues like anxiety or depression. Their circumstances make them particularly susceptible to psychological stress. As many leave the familiar framework of home and school and move into an uncertain future, the newly independents have to find alternative support structures. New living situations, potentially in a new city or even country, starting university or a job, all these developments entail a multitude of mental pressures. In a time where social media is so influential, standards of self-representation are an added factor. According to one of the psychological guidance counsellors at Studentenwerk Berlin; stress, loneliness and self-image issues are very common results among many students.\n\nAs part of our research, we interviewed several university students from different backgrounds about negative emotions like these. One question was how they handle situations of feeling sad, stressed or lonely. The main insight was that everyone experienced this shit, but no one liked to deal with it. A prominent theme in the conversations was the difficulty to talk about emotional problems \u2013 be it a missed project deadline, a loss in the family or an eating disorder. It was mentioned\u00a0that it was easier for them to open up to someone who had similar problems and could empathize. However, it is difficult to identify the people that can offer support\u00a0when everyone tries to hide their struggles.\n\nAs a result, most people\u00a0don\u2019t decide to seek help until they had been in increasing pain for a prolonged amount of time. Yet at this point of outreach, recovery is still far. As we learned from our interviews, it can take months to find care that is suitable to the individual and more months to see any progress. While there is a great spectrum of available options, the general idea of psychological treatment is still stigmatized. It is often not even perceived as a possible solution. The psychologists we interviewed mentioned that many of their patients came to them only after being referred by a general practitioner or friends who had tried therapy themselves.\n\nYet, we cannot force people to seek help. Keeping quiet about insecurities is a justified mental defence mechanism. When we share our feelings, we are vulnerable, exposed. Oftentimes, the recipient is simply not equipped to offer a good, empathic response. This could almost be described as a societal incompetence,\u00a0stemming from a general lack of awareness.\n\nOUR GOAL\n\nWe want\u00a0to challenge the current attitude towards psychological care. Our project tries to de-stigmatize psychological pain and make the sensitive, 'taboo' issue of mental health more present and approachable to the public. We believe that udnerstanding and empathy is vital to provide good care for people that are suffering from emotional distress. We want to make it clear\u00a0that feeling shitty is nothing to be ashamed of, but actually a very common thing. Also, we want the impact of these feelings to be understandable, so that more people can offer informed, helpful responses. When this happens, the threshold of reaching out is lowered, which in return allows problems to be addressed before they develop into serious mental conditions.\n\nINSPIRATION\n\nThere are a number of inspiring projects who deal with exactly this issue of awareness. One clever way artists are spreading awareness is over the internet. Tumblr users like Rubyetc, Beth Evans or Sarah\u2019s Scribbles have gained quite a following with their funny, relatable comics about everyday struggles. Seeing that you are not alone in your suffering can be very comforting. Recently, illustrator Gemma Correll created a series of drawings as part of an online awareness campaign for Mental Health America to visualize what #mentalillnessfeelslike. Their campaign encourages people to open up about their conditions and harvest the power of sharing.\n\nA related approach can be found in the various devices that exist to simulate old age. Suits like \u2018GERT\u2019 are designed to make the wearer feel the impairments that come with aging: stiffness and limited mobility, decreasing strength, blurred sight, muffled hearing. The concept was originally developed to enable caretakers of elderly people to better understand the needs and fears of their patients. Now, gadgets with similar effects, designed by students at Weimar University, are being exhibited at the Hygiene Museum in Dresden, allowing the public to gain the same understanding.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn general, public exhibitions are a valuable source of inspiration when it comes to reaching people and conveying information. A prime example is the 'Happy Show', set up by design firm Sagmeister & Walsh. Verging somewhere between art and education, the show throughly explores the theme of happiness in a graphic, creative and interactive manner. Another show that encourages people to actively engage with the exhibit is Erwin Wurms 'Bei Mutti'. Visitors are isntructed to interact the artefacts on display, effectively becoming a piece of the art themselves.\n\n\nf9e1fc54827667adbc6d98f8ac208de7_1.jpg1920x1080 577 KB\n\n\nPROJECT PROPOSAL\n\nIn order to achieve our goal we propose a combination of an interactive exhibition and an information booth. This pop-up stall can easily be set up at universities events like open days and conferences.\n\nWe will exhibit various sadness simulators, wearable objects for the crowd to try which simulate the effects of being depressed, stressed or anxious. These objects have been inspired by an online survey we have conducted in order to find out how people physically feel when they are in emotional distress. Out of dozens of responses we have extracted the most common themes: weight on the shoulders, head pulling down, brain fog and a general discomfort in one's body feeling: hot, sticky and itchy. With these results we have designed various objects: A neck bender, a very heavy device to carry on his back being forced to lean forward. A helmet made of tinted transparent acrylic that simulates looking through a veil and muffles the sound of the surroundings and a really uncomfortable ill-fitting coat made of a super itchy and stiff fabric. We have more ideas but for now we have realized these three.\n\nThose who are\u00a0brave enough to test our simulators will receive a positive feedback. They will get to choose between 3 gifts: Stickers that encourage everyday task such as: \"got out of bad\", \"took a shower\" and \"washed my laundry\" in order to demonstrate how difficult these tasks can be to certain people. They could also choose comforting cynical tea bags that they can grant a friend in need on a rainy day or shit shaped chocolate pralines to compensate for the horrors they have just been through. The exhibition will also include an interactive board in which participants can share their feelings caused by the simulators or just generally and a second board presenting useful information regarding mental issues: how to identify, approachable treatments, support groups and other solutions. The first exhibition will take place during Berlin University of the Arts Semester end's exhibition and we hope it will continue to other universities around berlin and even in other cities in Europe.\n\nIf you hope so as well you are welcome to join us in a number of ways:\n\n\nSupport our Startnext campaign going online July 20th!

Due to a confluence of factors including overuse, population growth and climate change, an estimated two-thirds of the world\u2019s population will be living in water-stressed areas by 2025. One recent innovation that could potentially revolutionize water purification in poor, rural communities is the MadiDrop.\n\nThe MadiDrop is a porous ceramic disc that has been infused with silver or copper. When dropped in water, the tablet releases ionic silver or copper that strips away bacteria and pathogens to produce clean, drinkable water. Each tablet is capable of treating 10 to 20 litres of water for up to six months. The result is an affordable, easily distributable and long-lasting alternative for families who lack access to a safe, potable water source.\n\nThe MadiDrop is the second water treatment technology developed by PureMadi, an organization formed by a group of interdisciplinary students from the University of Virginia. Their first project was the creation of a ceramic water filter factory in South Africa. The filters use local labour, readily available materials (clay, sawdust and water) and are treated with a dilute solution of silver nano-particles that effectively filter out common waterborne pathogens. The PureMadi ceramic filters were designed to create a cheap and sustainable point-of-use water purification solution for low-income households. To date, they have been well-received and highly effective among families in Limpopo province, South Africa.\n\nThe impetus for the MadiDrop was to apply this successful model to create an even cheaper point-of-use water treatment technology. The MadiDrop can be used in a variety of water storage containers, and at only a few dollars per drop, can provide families with purified water for an extended period of time. Lab results look promising but extensive field testing is still required to determine whether the MadiDrop is a sustainable and culturally appropriate solution. With any luck, the MadiDrop will eventually be widely used to improve clean water access and curb the spread of waterborne diseases in low-income communities.", "created_at": "2017-11-28 01:44:38.994879", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:24:51.588023", "tag_id": 485, "post_id": 710, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 677}, {"id": 17854, "text": "", "quote": "Somewhere I have a Netscape pocket knife tool..", "created_at": "2019-12-13 16:02:40.333815", "updated_at": "2020-09-14 13:28:07.594161", "tag_id": 7287, "post_id": 65968, "creator_id": 5059, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 11932}, {"id": 19448, "text": "", "quote": "u domovima zdravlja i ambulantama vi\u0161e nema lekara koji bi pacijente uputili u te klini\u010dke centre? \u0160ta sada kada lekari i medicinske sestre odlaze u zemlje Evropske unije, dok im se u Srbiji obe\u0107avavaju ve\u0107e plate i bolji \u017eivotni standard za dve, najvi\u0161e tri godine? \u0160ta sada kada oni koji imaju, pla\u0107aju na hiljade evra, na crno i bez ra\u010duna, da se njihovi najmiliji le\u010de ili da umru dostojanstveno u privatnim klinikama, dok oni koji te hiljade nemaju, bespomo\u0107no gledaju kako im bliski ljudi odlaze?", "created_at": "2020-05-28 03:25:23.689000", "updated_at": "2020-10-23 10:42:21.098215", "tag_id": 3533, "post_id": 58456, "creator_id": 4818, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 10623}, {"id": 19449, "text": "", "quote": "U Srbiji je izra\u017een trend odlaska medicinskih sestara i lekara u zemlje  EU, ali imamo \"sre\u0107u\" da jo\u0161 imamo veliki broj tih ljudi koji do sada nisu ni u Srbiji mogli da prona\u0111u posao, pa ima ko da popuni ta mesta koja ostaju prazna.", "created_at": "2020-05-28 03:25:23.693205", "updated_at": "2020-10-23 10:42:21.104225", "tag_id": 3533, "post_id": 58507, "creator_id": 4819, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 10623}, {"id": 19450, "text": "", "quote": "Zdravstveni sistem i sistem socijalne za\u0161tite uru\u0161eni su nebrigom, populisti\u010dkim pristupom, nedostatkom novca i korupcijom.", "created_at": "2020-05-28 03:25:23.695543", "updated_at": "2020-10-23 10:42:21.110022", "tag_id": 3533, "post_id": 58456, "creator_id": 4818, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 10623}, {"id": 12355, "text": "", "quote": "Under pressure to digitize everything, hospitals are hackers\u2019 biggest new target", "created_at": "2017-11-28 02:13:54.155015", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:24:51.926560", "tag_id": 722, "post_id": 5517, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 5484}, {"id": 15882, "text": "", "quote": "\"copyleft\",", "created_at": "2019-07-23 11:08:38.816106", "updated_at": "2020-09-11 14:45:00.598165", "tag_id": 1079, "post_id": 53542, "creator_id": 5209, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 9881}, {"id": 26971, "text": "", "quote": "take autonomous cars as an example: for them to function, you have to remove everything that has a lot of uncertainty from their way.

Wave, as our team is called, is trying to make someone suffering from parkinson's and their caregiver's lives easier using technology that we have today at our disposal.\n\nThe first signs of someone having parkinson's are the motor symptoms. These symptoms include essential tremors in hands and other parts of the body. These symptoms further advance overtime enough that it makes it difficult for them to perform the easiest of daily tasks.\u00a0The symptoms occur when the level of dopamine, the chemical responsible for body movement coordination, reduces in the brain. Medication is used to replenish the dopamine levels or fake the action of the dopamine.\n\nWith our prototype, we propose to make the lives of someone with parkinson\u2019s simpler. Our prototype will be wearables that can monitor the motor symptoms of the patient.\u00a0Our prototype will monitor the common symptoms like tremor and stiffness in the human body, and if the symptoms are showing an uncommon behaviour, the prototype can beam the information to the smartphone to remind the patient or the caregiver to take the medicines to or to see the neurologist.\n\n\nParkinson&#39;s Sketch.jpg600x1270 104 KB\n\n\nOur goal is to help someone who has recently started showing symptoms of parkinson\u2019s to track their motor symptoms and also prolong the initial stage as much as possible.\n\nA lot of research-based apps and services are available today that help in better understanding the symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s.

Attraverso un processo di ricerca abbiamo evidenziato come un approccio olistico, che a colpo d\u2019occhio fornisca un quadro clinico completo, comporterebbe indubbi vantaggi a medici e pazienti.\n\n1.2 Acquisizione di idee, spunti, intuizioni\n\nLo spunto iniziale che ha dato l\u2019avvio al progetto \u00e8 scaturito da una serie di interviste condotte tra medici e pazienti. Questi ultimi in particolare lamentavano la scarsa preparazione del medico rispetto al loro specifico caso clinico, delegando pertanto al paziente stesso, la responsabilit\u00e0 nel fornire informazioni dettagliate circa la patologia da affrontare.\n\n1.3 Definizione del problema\n\nIl problema che abbiamo affrontato pu\u00f2 essere definito come una carenza di comunicazione. I diversi professionisti della cura non possiedono, ad oggi, uno strumento semplice e veloce che possa tenerli aggiornati rispetto alla progressione clinica di ogni loro paziente. Le informazioni sanitarie sono disgregate e appartengono allo specialista che le ha prodotte attraverso la propria visita. Queste informazioni tendenzialmente non hanno altro modo di essere condivise, se non attraverso il paziente stesso, cui si delega il compito e la responsabilit\u00e0 di fornire tali informazioni allo specialista successivo.\n\nDoc.doc si propone essenzialmente come un aggregatore di informazioni, un unico database medico nel quale possano essere convogliati e organizzati i dati dei pazienti che si hanno in cura. In questo modo il medico pu\u00f2 affrontare ogni nuova visita avendo gi\u00e0 chiara l\u2019anamnesi pregressa del paziente in questione. Doc.doc inoltre fornisce tutti i contatti degli specialisti che hanno condotto una determinata visita in precedenza, e rende estremamente semplice (un clic) la possibilit\u00e0 di mettersi in contatto con un collega per richiedere un chiarimento o un parere rispetto ai dettagli di una certa una cartella clinica.\n\n2.0 Definizione\n\n2.1 Analisi delle soluzioni\n\nIn seguito ad una estesa sessione di una particolare forma di brainstorming, il brainwriting, sono stati vagliati diversi possibili approcci per affrontare il tema proposto dal bando OpenCare. Questi sono stati categorizzati in modo sistematico secondo la tecnica detta delle 4Cs (le quattro\u201dc\u201d: components, characteristics, challenges, characters) e quindi circoscritti in macro-aree che puntavano ad un certo specifico orientamento verso la risoluzione delle problematiche riscontrate in ambito sanitario.\n\n2.2 Ideazione del concept\n\nIn seguito ai risultati scaturiti dalle tecniche di brainstorming, \u00e8 stato realizzato un questionario da sottoporre ad un certo numero di pazienti, parenti dei pazienti e professionisti della cura (non solo medici, ma anche infermieri, farmacisti, fisioterapisti etc\u2026).\n\nQueste interviste si sono rivelate cruciali nel definire il percorso che doc.doc avrebbe intrapreso.\n\nInfatti, abbiamo riscontrato presso la maggior parte dei pazienti intervistati, una sostanziale insoddisfazione riguardo i processi di comunicazione con i propri medici. In particolare, nel caso di patologie particolarmente complesse, dove \u00e8 necessario il coinvolgimento di molteplici specialisti, spesso i medici coinvolti sono parzialmente o totalmente all\u2019oscuro riguardo i progressi dei colleghi nei confronti di uno specifico aspetto nella cura della patologia. La comunicazione di queste informazioni, avviene, ma quasi esclusivamente per mezzo del paziente, il quale \u00e8 costretto ad assumersi la piena responsabilit\u00e0 dell\u2019accuratezza e completezza delle informazioni fornite.\n\n2.3 Proposta della soluzione\n\nIn seguito alla ricerca svolta, \u00e8 stato quindi logico cominciare a pensare alla progettazione di uno strumento gestionale che permettesse ai medici di avere immediatamente disponibili tutte le informazioni concernente un certo paziente, comprese le informazioni di contatto dei colleghi responsabili di una certa visita.\n\nAbbiamo cos\u00ec progettato uno strumento gestionale che facilita l\u2019organizzazione degli appuntamenti di un medico, ordina in maniera chiara le cartelle cliniche dei pazienti per tipologia e cronologia, permette in un clic di contattare un collega tramite telefono, chat o email, infine rende pi\u00f9 efficiente la visita stessa poich\u00e9 doc.doc consente al medico curante di aggiornarsi circa i progressi del proprio paziente nei minuti precedenti alla visita.\n\nDoc.doc infatti pu\u00f2 essere programmato per concedere uno spazio di tempo (tendenzialmente 10 minuti) tra una visita e l\u2019altra, che permetta al medico di prendere visione della cartella clinica del paziente che sta per incontrare.\n\n3.0 Sviluppo\n\n3.1 Progettazione e prova del prototipo\n\nDoc.doc allo stato attuale consiste in un prototipo interattivo realizzato attraverso la piattaforma proto.io.\n\nPrima di ottenere questo risultato abbiamo sostenuto una approfondita analisi UX che ci ha consentito di effettuare scelte precise circa lo sviluppo di certe funzionalit\u00e0.\u00a0In particolare, attraverso tecniche di Brainwriting e alcune empathy map abbiamo circoscritto l\u2019ambito di lavoro.\n\nA seguito di alcune interviste di orientamento con pazienti e professionisti sanitari abbiamo definito ulteriormente gli obiettivi del progetto, concentrandoci su una \u201cone primary task\u201d, che nel caso di doc.doc consiste nell\u2019aggregazione semplificata dei dati di ogni paziente. Considerando quindi alcuni ipotetici scenari di utilizzo del nostro servizio (presso specialisti\u00a0o medici di base, in studio o in visita a domicilio etc\u2026) abbiamo sviluppato una prima logica di user flow e infine la sua realizzazione grafica interattiva, della quale si pu\u00f2 avere una tangibile esperienza d\u2019uso qui: http://bit.ly/2oOXbmK (una volta scaricata l'intera\u00a0cartella \u00e8 sufficiente aprire il file index.html con il proprio browser, meglio se Chrome).\n\nInoltre in seguito allo sviluppo del prototipo \u00e8 stato condotto un piccolo usability testing\u00a0che ha evidenziato piccole problematiche, immediatamente risolte con il rilascio della versione successiva, di cui si pu\u00f2 prendere visione al link sopracitato.\n\n3.2\u00a0Prova della fruibilit\u00e0\n\nE\u2019 stato condotto un piccolo usability testing, parzialmente moderato, che ha sostanzialmente confermato tutti gli obiettivi di usabilit\u00e0 stabiliti a monte. In particolare i nostri utenti test sono stati, per la maggior parte, in grado di portare a termine le operazioni richieste, quali: 1. Consultare una cartella clinica, 2. Consultare la rubrica pazienti e professionisti, 3. Aggiungere un nuovo appuntamento, 4. Contattare un collega. In questa fase abbiamo ritenuto prematuro considerare ulteriore metriche di controllo oggettive quali tempi e statistiche di errore, concentrandoci piuttosto su misurazioni di gradimento soggettive e mantenendo come unico conteggio obiettivo il numero di operazioni portate a buon fine.\n\nSono stati riscontrati alcuni problemi nella fruibilit\u00e0 dei dati della cartella clinica e delle funzionalit\u00e0 ad essa collegate (\u00e8 infatti possibile anche iniziare una conversazione\u00a0con un collega). L\u2019organizzazione dei contenuti di quella determinata schermata \u00e8 stata quindi modificata sulla base dei feedback ricevuti, cos\u00ec come l\u2019intero look&feel dell\u2019applicazione \u00e8 stato rivisto coerentemente rispetto alle modifiche apportate.\n\n4.0 Rilascio\n\n4.1 Completamento del prodotto/servizio\n\nIl prototipo \u00e8 gi\u00e0 stato testato, ma andrebbe ulteriormente verificato su un campione pi\u00f9 esteso di utenti, seguito eventualmente da un A/B testing.\n\nConclusa la fase di usability testing sul prototipo, si proceder\u00e0 quindi con lo sviluppo di programmazione vero e proprio, la\u00a0cui funzionalit\u00e0\u00a0verr\u00e0\u00a0verificata\u00a0ad ogni milestone raggiunta.\n\nInfine, verranno concepite strategie di distribuzione, idealmente con il coinvolgimento delle ASL locali, per permettere un capillare ed effettivo utilizzo del servizio.\n\n4.2 Rilascio finale\n\nE\u2019 in fase di definizione una timeline di sviluppo che presenti le milestone necessarie al completamento del prodotto, secondo specifiche tempistiche.\n\n4.3 Produzione\n\nIl team di sviluppo tecnico \u00e8 ancora da definirsi, ma stiamo valutando una collaborazione con I-SEE\u00a0(http://www.i-seecomputing.com), specialisti nell produzione di software in ambito medico/ sanitario.", "created_at": "2017-11-28 01:54:54.700004", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:24:51.648315", "tag_id": 485, "post_id": 33729, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 6578}, {"id": 19506, "text": "", "quote": "Lubi\u0142em ludziom spo\u0142ecznie pomaga\u0107", "created_at": "2020-06-03 13:18:38.171498", "updated_at": "2020-09-03 14:10:02.330668", "tag_id": 925, "post_id": 58450, "creator_id": 6484, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 10622}, {"id": 12347, "text": "", "quote": "I have already made a small collection of mp3 players, ear plugs for listening, some spare parts, and solar for charging the batteries.

So they would have to listen to the lecture before they get to the music. This will be some extra work in the beginning but I think you made a good point.

We started our project RefugeesWork to help newcomers to connect with locals who are looking for freelancers to outsource some work to them.\n\nIt all started in August 2015 when lots of newcomers, mainly from Syria, arrived to Germany.\n\nIt now turns out that it\u2019s not very easy for them to find any kind of employment at all. German companies seem to not need the skills they bring to the table and even if they do have what they are looking for, they often reject people who do not speak German well.\n\nWe decided to use our digital skills, first of all programming, to help them. We developed a marketplace app where on one side newcomers can register and describe their skills and on the other side local organizations can post their requests for freelancers. We believe work is the best pathway to connect refugees and locals and to date, we have over 300 registrations on the site and big community in Berlin and online. Those Syrians come from all walks of life and some have excellent background, or were running their own business.\n\nBut we also realized that freelance requests are mostly for freelancers with web and mobile development background. These are the jobs freelancers can do online, they don't need to speak the local language and because all the organizations are trying to automate their processes, there is actually a big need for these professions. We checked our database and available statistics and figured out that most of newcomers are young, they just finished their high school or had to leave in the middle of their studies so they actually lack necessary skills to integrate into the highly specialized German job market. Freelancing would give refugees freedom from discrimination they would face otherwise and freelancers are usually paid way better. The tricky part is in making sure there is a regular flow of work. That is our experience.\n\n\nRefugeeswork.jpg960x638 84.1 KB\n\n\nTherefore we decided to extend our Berlin based coding school for kids and use our experiences to create online e-learning platform to teach newcomers programming: from how to install browser to how to build your mobile app. All the learners can learn digital skills/programming no matter where they are, they get 24/7 support on the chat from mentors and other learners and later and they can apply for projects companies outsource through RefugeesWork. All the learners become part of digital collective Coding Amigos, that we started with international crew of developers with activist streak already 3 years ago. We meet in Berlin 2x a week and co-work together on client projects or our own apps that we in long term want to connect in a circular economy. For us - even though circular economy is usually connected to recycling - that means that supply chains form supply circles and money is not loaned by governments and other usual suspects and end up in always the same pockets who save it and don\u2019t even know what to do with all the money.\n\nCurrently we are also following the work of Sensorica in Canada and Enspiral in New Zealand. Our wish is to create a micro-holding co-ownership model. One part of the motivation is to shield these professionals from all kinds of discrimination that they might otherwise experience.\n\nIt shields them, for example from the usual politicking among corporate employees who might tend to put such newcomers into a fairly low place. And another part of the motivation is exploring processes and legal ways for cooperation and decision making between many micro-holdings.\n\nWe try to list all our initiatives inside of Github organization SquatUp.\n\nWe try to keep all our work open and transparent for which we for now use Github.com, Gitter.im and Waffle.io which allow us versioned storing our documents, including code, working on issues on a kanban board and use open communication on a public chat.\n\nAll our projects are made with zero budget so with pure love and dedication for our mission: open source & transparency, inclusiveness, digital literacy and open organization. It is not easy, but we don't want to waste our time chasing funding and investors or clients, but instead co-create the world we want to live in. And we believe right people and opportunities will come from that and from the people that share the mindset and want to join us.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to make a living with all of this, so we just try to live as cheap as possible and we work for a better future where society is organized differently utilizing radical transparency and open source. Until then we live from savings that we sometimes manage to build when working on paid projects. By empowering refugees with skills we hope they will later become our partners and continue to help us build an alternative work. On top of that, we might manage to get in projects on a more regular basis and outsource paid work to each other.\n\nSo if you are a programmer, \u201dapptivist\u201d, please consider reaching out and connect your apps to our ecosystem via API or help us build an open ecosystem of related apps.\n\nIf you know anyone who did not yet start to learn programming, please tell them to join us in http://gitter.im/codingamigos/learners so they can get started for free immediately. We offer 24/7 support for free to get learners from zero to be able to create their first mobile app within a couple of weeks up to a few months given learners are disciplined and learn full time.\n\nAnd last but not least, if you can bring in paid IT projects to support our voluntary efforts, the community of learners and our effort to prototype alternative ways of organizing and working together, we would appreciate it a lot. Everyone who successfully brings in a project and helps us communicating with the customer during the project will be transparently included in the sharing of the revenue.\n\nThe production of this article was supported by Op3n Fellowships - an ongoing program for community contributors during May - November 2016.\n\nLinks:\n\nRefugeesWork - www.refugeeswork.com\n\nOnline JavaScript school - www.wizardamigos.com\n\nCoding Amigos meetup - www.meetup.com/codingamigos\n\nCoding Amigos collective - www.codingamigos.com\n\nSquatUp - https://github.com/SquatUp/projects/blob/master/README.md\n\nNina Breznik - @ninabreznik\n\nAlexander Praetorius - @serapath", "created_at": "2017-11-28 19:50:10.841373", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:31:38.572897", "tag_id": 1047, "post_id": 769, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 736}, {"id": 26986, "text": "", "quote": "I have followed from a distance a proposal for a \u2018lie detector\u2019 AI to be piloted on European borders.

Do they cry alone in their bedrooms? Do they logon to the internet? How do young people in grief find each other? Do they phone a friend? Do they enter a counselling centre? Do they search through hashtags and websites?\n\nDeath has never been more public than in the age of the internet. Alongside waves of #RIP[insertcelebrity] tributes and #[nameofvictim] police shooting activism proliferating on social media are viral posts of everyday people approaching grief and documenting their experience on the internet: recounting a person\u2019s final days, parting words and gratitude from the deathbed, captures of assisted suicide and \u201cright to die parties\u201d, and families commemorating the deceased.\nThese experiences of death and loss have been augmented and prolonged with the growth of social media use. More specifically, the ways in which a social media platform is structured and the dominant culture of its users has allowed people in grief to process their loss in innovative ways \u2013 new spaces of affect are created, new paralanguage vocabularies are innovated, and new transient networks of care are formulated.\nResearch has emerged in various disciplines focusing on internet memorial pages (in which the deceased and/or their funeral is commemorated on a public page), digital altars and graves (in which the living pay respects to the dead via technological mediations), afterlife digital estate management (in which the transfer and privacy of internet artifacts belonging to the deceased are negotiated), and even RIP trolling (in which trolls hijack Facebook memorial pages with abusive content). There is even an academic journal and a handful of institutes dedicated to \u201cDeath Studies\u201d.\nFor instance, monuments.com enables clients to personalize cemetery headstones with a QR code. By scanning the QR code with a smartphone, users are led to an interactive website where they may upload images and text of well wishes to the deceased and their family, or contribute to building their family heritage through stories or family trees. Users are also able to re-share their post on more mainstream social media.\nAs an anthropologist and ethnographer of digital culture, I have a comprehensive understanding of such practices. But when my younger sister passed away earlier this year, the ways in which her friends expressed and managed their grief in digital spaces led me to discover a rich repertoire of coping mechanisms, exchange of affect, and mutual aftercare in a vernacular created by young people who grew up with the internet - these really moved my heart and encouraged me to examine young people and grief in digital spaces.\nBut\u00a0just what is mutual aftercare? Often after a global grieving event such as large-scale natural disasters or spates of violence, strangers would gather in public spaces that transform into transient sites of solidarity. With candles, flowers, and written tributes in tow, strangers come together to process their grief, share their grief, and lend support to those in grief. Bodies who are not familiar with each other are motivated by the immediate, tangible, and tactile presence of other bodies in an enclosed space to disperse emotions they would usually restraint, and dispense care they would usually withhold when the group\u2019s motivations are briefly aligned. Sociologist Emile Durkheim refers to this as \u201ccollective effervescence\u201d. This is \u2018aftercare\u2019, or the care one offers to others after a hurtful experience. When people come together to publicly acknowledge their pain and simultaneously offer care and concern to fellow others in pain, this becomes a network of \u2018mutual aftercare\u2019. Young people seem to be doing similar things in digital spaces, and I wanted to find out how.\n*\nBeing a young person in my mid-twenties for whom the internet and social media is second nature, I seamlessly took to my blog to make sense of my grief and loss. I wrote about my experiences of \u201cholding space\u201d for my sister in her final days (see also Heather Plett), and about learning to declutter physical artifacts despite my abstract emotional attachment to these things. I also wrote about how I felt when Facebook friends began \u201cdeep-liking\u201d my old posts on grief and how it impeded my progress and recovery. As much as I felt hurt and disappointed by these peers, I could not justify my anger knowing that digital etiquette is not universal \u2013 knowing how to approach someone in grief on social media or how to express grief on social media is not actually \u201ccommon sense\u201d. Digital etiquette varies across personal beliefs and cultural norms, and is highly dependent on the context of interpersonal relationships and the norms of a social media platform. In other words, digital etiquette surrounding grief has to be taught, learnt, and practiced.\nI was both a young person managing grief in digital spaces and an ethnographer invested in understanding everyday practices through intimate anthropological inquiry. To do this, I conducted personal interviews with young people who self-reported using digital media (i.e. the internet, social media, devices and artifacts, non-analogue spaces) to manage their grief. I started with friends in my sister\u2019s social groups, made open calls to undergraduates in local universities, and amassed informants via snowball sampling.\nI wanted to understand what young people did on the internet to recover and how this differed from analogue coping mechanisms pre-social media. I wanted to learn how they constructed solidarity, conveyed empathy, and maintained networks of mutual aftercare. Some also showed me their smartphone apps so that I could study how they crafted content, ranging from emotive Instagram captions of meaningful photographs to extensive digital catalogues of every tactile item the deceased has ever touched.\nI learnt that a vocabulary of grief was quietly emerging among young people. For instance, emoji and emoticons were especially significant as a paralanguage. Some reported that \u201cwhen words fail\u201d, or when they \u201chad no strength\u201d to craft responses back to friends who had sent them condolences, they would mobilize emoji or emoticons to acknowledge receipt, demonstrate reciprocity, or express gratitude. One person who had lost his father to a critical illness said that while \u201cthe adults\u201d in his family did not seem to articulate their grief and loss to each other (\u201cthey strictly never said anything about it in the house\u201d), those in his generation such as his cousins took to Facebook to comfort each other via status updates and follow-up comments. Another young person began a groupchat on the messaging app WhatsApp and recruited friends of the deceased from all walks of life into the chat. They used the groupchat as a semi-private outlet to share their thoughts without having to worry about self-censorship \u2013 many of them felt Facebook was \u201ctoo public\u201d, that email was \u201ctoo impersonal\u201d, and that meeting in person was \u201ctoo soon\u201d, \u201ctoo painful\u201d, or \u201ctoo awkward\u201d. As such, the space of a groupchat accorded them the freedom to process grief more transparently among empathetic others in a safe space; the groupchat became a space of mutual aftercare.\n*\nThe need to understand young people\u2019s grief in digital spaces became clearer to me as I began consulting and conversing with healthcare professionals in palliative care. One hospice nurse expressed that as a patient approaches their end of life, most family members would single-heartedly focus all their effort and affect on that one person. Upon the death of their loved one, many people are suddenly hit with grief all at once and are unable to transit into care for each other, or \u201ccare for the living\u201d. In other words, despite social workers and counsellors preaching the value of \u201ccare chains\u201d, many people who are deep in grief simply do not have the mental capacity and physical resources to plan for self-care or mutual aftercare.\nAnother doctor reported seeing an increasing number of young patients in their late teens or early-to-mid twenties. Sorrowfully recounting a memorable incident in which her young patient instructed her to post a specifically-worded status update on his Facebook after death, she came to realize that young people deeply valued their digital estates as platforms to communicate gratitude and farewells even on their deathbed. In a handful of other instances, young patients requested for their doctors and counsellors to add them on Facebook or to read their blog in order to access sentiment they felt incapable of articulating in person, in physical spaces, via traditional media\nDespite the very crucial work that such palliative staff engage in, much of this work is negotiated ad hoc on-the-go as they \u201cplay by ear\u201d. Most staff do \u201cwhat feels right\u201d based on their individual relationships with their patients, or on their personal concepts of etiquette and ethics. In other words, once we have a better understanding of how young people grief in digital spaces, palliative healthcare workers can be equipped to guide their young patients and clients using their preferred coping mechanisms, devices, and vocabulary. To a generation for whom death and grief are increasingly public spectacles, such care will be crucial to preserving the mental well being of cohorts to come.\n*\nHave you ever commemorated the death of a loved one in digital spaces? What did you do? How did others respond to you?\nWhenever you witness someone sharing their grief on social media, how do you feel? Does it motivate you to respond to the person in particular ways?\nHow can we use social media more conscientiously so as to create spaces for mutual aftercare?\u00a0What can we do for each other in digital spaces whenever a global grieving event occurs?\nWe would love to hear from you.\n*\nThis article was written by Dr Crystal Abidin for OpenCare Research, Edgeryders.
