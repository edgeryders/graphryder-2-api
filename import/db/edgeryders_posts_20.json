Contemporary societies apply geosciences extensively for their economic, societal and cultural activities (Bohle 2017; Gill and Bullough 2017; Krausmann et al. 2013, 2017; Rosol, Nelson, and Renn 2017). These activities bind, through global supply chains, the entire globe into one social-ecological system (Reyers et al. 2018) that intersects deeply with the physical and biological systems of the Earth. Crafts-persons, technicians, architects and engineers apply geoscience knowledge, at least implicitly, when altering natural environments or creating artefacts, e.g. extraction of minerals, the laying the foundations for buildings, or managing floodplains. Artists, poets or philosophers of any time or culture refer to the Earth for co-shaping human identity. Possibly the most early (known) reference is the Gilgamesh Epos of the thried millennium BC(George 2000).  Contemporary geoscience knowledge seeps into modern thinking and dealings (Moores 1997; Peppoloni and Di Capua 2012), often without being identified as such (Bohle 2015; Bohle, Sibilla, and Casals I Graells 2017), and rarely put forward so openly as in the metaphorical title of the book by the geochemists Langmuir and Broecker (Langmuir and Broecker 2012), \u2018How to build a habitable planet\u2019. Large-scale infrastructures like shore defences, hydropower plants or urban dwellings visibly interact with the geosphere and are a physical expression of how people situate themselves on Earth; views that alter through history (Ellis 2011; Fressoz 2012; Purdy 2015). Whatever the philosophical concepts are that frame the construction of these infrastructures, they could not have been built without a profound geoscience culture (Brown et al. 2017; H\u00e4usler 2018; Ruddiman et al. 2015; Wysession et al. 2012) that includes scientific understanding, technological know-how and societal justifications. Likewise, purposefully designed global production systems or consumption patterns couple human activity with the geosphere at a planetary scale. The coupling happens through cycles of matter, energy and information (Haff 2014b; Rosol et al. 2018; Zalasiewicz et al. 2016) that are mostly invisible. Greenhouse gas emissions are well-known as the most prominent example, although a similar case could be made for nitrogen or the global agriculture system (Campbell et al. 2017; Morseletto 2019; Zhang et al. 2015).", "created_at": "2020-06-03 17:51:15.143216", "updated_at": "2020-06-03 17:51:15.143216", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 672, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 11.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [78091], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 840, "user_id": 3617, "topic_id": 807, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Bangladesh is not only one of the most densely populated countries in the world (with 926 persons per square kilometer) but also located in the world's largest delta, facing the Himalayas in the North, bordering India in the West, North and East, Myanmar in the Southeast, and the Bay of Bengal in the South.\n\nNo comprehensive empirical study has been conducted at present to determine the incidence and prevalence of disabilities in Bangladesh. The few studies that have been conducted reflect a medical rather than a social model of disability, and they are also limited in geographical coverage. While no reliable national data exist, anecdotal information and a number of micro studies generally suggest a disability prevalence rate of between 5 to 12 per cent. This is close to the WHO estimate, which states that 10 per cent of any given population can be considered to have some or other form of disability.\n\nIgnorance and wrong beliefs surrounding disability, compounded with a negative and derogatory attitude of the community (including family members) have contributed to the marginal development in the disability sector in Bangladesh.\n\nAs Bangladesh makes progress in implementing its health policies on infant mortality rate, immunization coverage, and general health care, there is likely a lowering of incidence of disabilities. However, the gains due to improved health care can be outweighed by the triple effects of increased number of surviving children with disabilities, increased number of people incurring disabilities due to old age (e.g., cataracts and arthritis), and widespread malnutrition. Disabilities due to natural calamities and road traffic accidents imply that the prevalence of people having disabilities in Bangladesh is likely to continually rise over-time, although the nature and distribution of disabilities are also likely to change considerably.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-17 17:25:00", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 03:46:10.129513", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 301, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 63422, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 11395, "post_number": 8, "raw": "Where is that spreadsheet with the names and URLS of facebook groups for the different countries? @noemi or @natalia_skoczylas", "created_at": "2019-11-08 06:12:08.260521", "updated_at": "2019-11-08 06:12:08.260521", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 19, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 12.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 847, "user_id": 3650, "topic_id": 814, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Once I went to the University of Virginia. I wanted to study English literature. Years were passing by and I thought that soon I would be able to enter the big world and start working at my dream job. I always wanted to write - no matter if it would be fiction or journalistics. I loved essay writing so I knew I wouldn't be left jobless.\u00a0\n\nWhen I graduated I found myself without no job offers, no money and no place to live. All I could do was return to my hometown Gardena and try to find something there. The city is not that big, so I couldn't find much job opportunities for such an ambitious young writer as myself. So I started earning money by writing academic papers for my younger mates from Virginia's. The money was poor, but after girls told their peers about me, I started to get more orders and caught myself enjoying this activity.\n\nA little bit later I met some people. They had a dream to build an online business. I told them about my passion for essay writing and they decided that they would help me. They thought it was a good business idea - to create a reliable essay writing service with reasonable prices. So they invested their money in my talent. Alex and Sammy hired good writers with a degree to write custom papers. My friends in Virginia were promoting our writing service on campus. We started to receive multiple orders. We were helping people who had troubles with their writing. Through some time we created a blog where we were writing tips on how to write certain kinds of academic papers and our clients were grateful for that because they got an opportunity to learn how to write properly by themselves. It was a success! We called our service EssayPro Club. Later it transformed to <a href=\"https://essayhub.com/\">EssayHub</a> - that was done because we wanted to create a brand, to let people know that we were here for them and we weren't going anywhere. So, that was my story of people believing in me. They gave my dream a shot and everybody won. I am still grateful to them because I now have my dream job and I can help people every day.\n\nSo don't be afraid and believe in yourself and in people who surround you. It may give you a lifetime opportunity.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-22 09:42:49", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 04:36:20.463906", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 420, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 20.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 59412, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 10796, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Really interesting seeing how this develops, lessons for all of us :)", "created_at": "2019-09-17 06:20:03.502148", "updated_at": "2019-09-17 06:20:03.502148", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 11, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 6.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 63519, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 11395, "post_number": 15, "raw": "These are the groups @TamaraVuk researched, but one thing she is saying is that the timelines in Serbia are such that it's better to write to them about 10 days before the event, so she's been holding up.

The LTDD group has been working to connect proposed positions into a coherent whole. Several common interests have emerged. Moving forward, I propose it is useful to unveil some of the low-level assumptions underlying our proposals. As a rule, they do not get discussed, because they are part of how we see the world. We find them natural, obvious. No need to discuss them, just as fish do not feel the need to discuss water.\n\nIn this situation, it is possible that our portfolio of positions turns out to be incoherent. This is not necessarily bad. We could claim pragmatism: different problems need approaches grounded in different world views. To do that, though, we need to be aware of which position encodes which world view.\n\nIn this document I try to do three things.\n\n1. Propose an idea of a Deep Demonstration.\n\n2. Highlight the areas where our world views might differ.\n\n3. Reflect on the implications of different world views for the scope of LTDD.\n\nAll that is just my personal views, and reflects my wish to question them and compare them with your own. No implications that I have a \"right\" way to do things.\n\n## 1. What do we mean by Deep Demonstration?\n\nI understand a Deep Demonstration as a demonstration that is deep.\n\n**A demonstration:** a scale model, as small and cheap and possible. We build it to show what the world would look like if someone acted upon the world as we acted upon the model. It is also something you show, not something you describe. A street corner could be a demonstration of a new style of city planning. The corner is smaller than the city, but you can stand in it and experience what the city would feel like, if it were to follow the planning style in question.\n\n**Deep**: it encodes changes that are radical enough, and sustained by real social practices. Imagine, for example, that our city planning innovation includes parking spaces for bicycles. To be a deep demonstration, the street corner needs to have parking spaces for bicycles, and real people that use them. Hiring actors to pretend they are locking their bicycles there is not deep enough.\n\nIf the above is correct, a deep demonstration on long-termism is one or more small contexts where real-life actors live in the long term. They make long-term decisions; build to last; plan for resilience rather than short-term efficiency, etc.\n\n## 2. Three questions on world views\n\n### Question 1. Is long-term thinking contendible?\n\nSeveral proposal circulated within the group imply that some solutions are within reach. Example: some indigenous people have a \"seven generations\" rule when they make decisions. This is an attractive idea, why do we not push more decision-makers to adopt it?\n\nWhether we should do so or not depends on whether decision-making processes are contendible. To be contendible means that there is no major barrier to entry, or change. In our example, decision-making is contendible if decision makers are quite open to adopting new methods. Maybe they were not aware that indigenous people had come up with such an ingenious system!\n\n* Naive innovators think everything is contendible. Short-termism is nonsense! But now we will fix it, because we see this, whereas everyone else does not.\n\n* Naive conservatives think nothing is contendible. \"If it were possible, someone would already have done it\".\n\nNon-naive changemakers needs a way to decide whether a situation is contendible or not. Eliezer Yudkowsky has proposed that a contendible situation is in an [inadequate equilibrium](https://equilibriabook.com/). It is still an equilibrium (that is why it has not changed), but that equilibrium is inadequate, and it might be possible to disrupt it with a reasonable effort. Upon proposing a position, it is a good hygiene norm to say why our approach can deliver change where so many smart people have failed.\n\n### Question 2. Is the actor of change individual or collective?\n\nSome theories of change take as their unit of analysis the individual. Example: nudge theory. Individual behaviour depends on individual incentives and individual framing of information. It only depends on those: the behavior of the individuals determine that of the system. Design incentives and framing to get the desired behavior.\n\nOthers take take as their unit of analysis the collective. Example: all complex system approaches. The behavior of the system can never be deduced from that of the individuals in it. Rebound- and other second-order effects are important and need modelling.\n\nWhich position reflects which stance?\n\n### Question 3: volume knobs or system attractors?\n\nSuppose you feel you understand why something happens, and you would want it to change. For example, you understand how \"Hot money\" on financial markets feeds instability and vice versa. What would corrective measures look like?\n\nOne possibility is that they look like a volume knob. In our example, a Tobin Tax can be set at any level. The higher the tax, the higher the incentive to hold financial positions for a long time.\n\nThe other possibility is that they look like pushes to dislodge the system from where it currently is. But the space of possible equilibria is not a continuous one. The system can only rest in one ot its attractors. It is possible to disrupt it, so that it leaves its current state, but it will always end up in one of the attractors. For example, speculators might elude a Tobin Tax moving to some other jurisdiction. In this case, the minimum viable change might consist of a introducing a Tobin Tax and a \"world state\". Gradualism won't work.\n\nBy the way, the same reasoning applies to culture. Some of our meetings have focused on cultural artifacts (Hollywood productions) as determining culture, including long-termism. This means culture is a lever. But is it? You can of produce a cultural artifacts encoding non-mainstream culture, but it is not clear that you can make it be mainstream. Anecdotally, creators in the mass culture markets work by canons and tropes, and feel like breaking them results in unsuccessful products. System attractors are too strong \u2013 until they aren't and, say, the Jedi knight can be a black woman. But maybe by then masscult is simply recording the change, not producing it.\n\n## 3. Implications for the LTDD\n\n* Do we agree on what a deep demonstration is?\n\n* Where are our positions in terms of contendibility, unit of analysis, viability of gradual solutions? We at the Sci-Fi Economics Lab tend to think that most issues are not that contendible; that the minimum viable unit of analysis is the collective, and rebound- and second-order effects are common; and that change is more similar to a jump from one system attractor to another than to a smooth, gradual glide. This view forces on us a lot of intellectual humility. It brings us towards experiments and research, more than high impact and scale. Hence my cautiousness. \n\n* What is the \"right\" degree of coherence across the different positions for LTDD? How do we acknowledge it in the portfolio?\n\nGrateful for any feedback, as always.", "created_at": "2020-06-10 14:44:33.968185", "updated_at": "2020-06-23 14:42:21.150398", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1220, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 97.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [6417, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 40427, "user_id": 4242, "topic_id": 7837, "post_number": 35, "raw": "Hi to all of you here,\nI'm Beatrice Leone from Lecce, I'm a trainer, a coach and a process oriented facilitator facilitator working with refugees, social workers, students and young unemployed  people.

Now they're also trying to maximize the growth in profit of financial firms. This is a substantial difference. And this was just a political decision.\u201d\n  * why are we having this event in Brussels? Because this is the capital of Europe, and the It's a place where we can multiply the impact of a shift in thinking, you see. So it is not a coincidence that the keynote, the keynote lecture of science fiction economics lab, is going to be chaired by Kirsten Dunlop. She's the CEO of EIT CLimate-KIC which is the European Union's largest agency that funds climate innovation. So what what we are seeing here is that if we can generate this kind of fresh thinking, we can Throw it over the wall to the people that use it, which is, which is the public, the public authorities, the public powers. And on the other hand, if we can show to economists and to science fiction authors interest of the powers that be, then we can incentivize them to do more work in this area. So hopefully we can use Brussels as a kind of lens that focuses this, this process and makes a few more people see.\n  * \u201c if actually we optimize for resilience rather than for a available availability, always no questions asked, which is more consumer a stick idea, then you would have a much more efficient system even present economics desk because the, the kilowatt would cost less because you don't need to transfer it anymore. you produce energy locally with your own solar panels.\u201d\n  * \u201cHowever, it turns out that the economics in my lifetime kind of pivoted from from being a place where you could inform landscape collective choices to to a discipline that basically enforces and improve serve if possible, a single model So when I started the my undergraduate courses, it was still the way it is. So you still at to a competing economic models, the Soviet one and the western one. And you actually had entire departments but we are studying socialistic on economics, not just economies but economics. And I saw the kind of a tail end of that there's very different way to think about things.\u201d\n  * \u201c this world building thing that the science fiction authors have you you take the world that you see and then you say well what would happen if whatever robots could think what would happen if there were a bunch of miners mining the asteroids for precious metals? So what would happen if we could travel through time this kind of stuff?\u201d\n  * \u201cscientists like turning the world\u2019s fabric in their heads, and trying to pull a thread in that fabric, and see what happens. In the internet era, you can really this as it as it develops because many of these authors have blogs and and the debates on the blogs are pretty impressive.\u201d\n   * \u201cI like very much Charles Stross. He runs a very impressive blog in which he asks questions like how many human population that we need in order to sustain a technologically advanced civilization and this is very useful why you want us interested in that is that he's thinking of the space colonization experience shows slower than light now we don't have start thanks warp drive. So you're going to have to send the starship to win some some near star and then that is going to have to keep the colony going on it. So means, so how many people do you send?\u201d\n  * \u201chow many human population that we need in order to sustain a technologically advanced civilization\u201d\n  * \u201cSo you're going to have to send the starship to win some near star and then that is going to have to keep the colony going on it. So means, so how many people do you send?\u201d\n  * \u201cI find that this kind of thinking is really refreshing and is really empowering because it is it ends up being a way to understand the words that can inform your own choices and your own actions. To turn the world around in your head and to pull the threads of society's fabric and see which one leads to where.\u201d\n  * \u201cthey created fictional economies that were not real, but plausible. Enough it was they were doing exactly what economics itself is no longer doing.\u201d\n  * \u201cI could really associate economic concepts from the theory that we haven't discussed the real world to the future economy described by the offer.\u201d\n  * what if we could get economists that are versed in hard the Edge economic thinking, to look at those fictional economies that these people are describing, and maybe vet them and maybe you can analyze them and describe them and write papers that will support them?\n  * \u201clet's build in the the range of alternatives that society as to choose from. Maybe we want to keep the present system, it makes a lot of sense not to do crazy stuff, but we shouldn't keep the economic system because we can\u2019t think of a better one\u201d\n  * \u201cIf you want to make a career in academia you have to publish on the major journals if you have to publish on major journals, nowadays, economics doesn't really allow you to stray too far.\u201d\n  * \u201cyou cannot shift the academic debate because everything that every new paper that comes out has to be the present academic debate. So everything that is not that is ignored.\u201d\n  * \u201cget together some economists and some science fiction authors and see if this collaboration could create some kind of new economic thinking.\n  * \u201c The climate crisis is not there because people are evil or because people are stupid and don't really see what's up. happening. The climate crisis is here because it is profitable.\u201d\n  * \u201cWe do things that are transactable, and so can generate value, by our current definition of value. Right? Yes. So what we don't do is we don't invest in public goods because public goods by definition don't have a market.\u201d\n\n\n### \n\n\n\n### MEDIA COVERAGE of the SciFi Econ Lab event in November last year\n* Bruzz: https://www.bruzz.be/culture/culture/sciencefictionauteurs-en-economen-bedenken-de-economie-van-de-toekomst-2019-11-12\n* L\u2019Avenir: https://www.lavenir.net/cnt/dmf20191112_01405560/loin-des-cliches-fantaisistes-auteurs-de-sf-et-economistes-se-reunissent-pour-penser-l-economie-de-demain\n* Proximus.be: https://www.proximus.be/pickx/nl/1997472/sciencefictionauteurs-en-economisten-bedenken-in-brussel-de-economie-van-de-toekomst\n* RTBF: Bruno Schmitz interviewed Alberto on 7/11 : https://www.rtbf.be/info/regions/bruxelles/detail_notre-agenda-du-week-end-comment-la-science-fiction-pour-ameliorer-notre-monde?id=10361154.\n* RTBF Vivacit\u00e9: interview with Alberto?

Avoiding personal defeat is ethical top priority.\n\n* Lets make it clear:\u00a0Quality is one thing, safety is another. Quality depends on the maker = participant. Safety is ensured by facilitator and mentors. Safety is a relative issue. Walking is risky \u2013 you may fall, therefore the neurologist may advice stop walking and use a wheelchair instead (a real casestory). As when we do clinical trials,\u00a0the participant must be guided through a \u201arisk assessment\u2019\n\n*\u00a0What you say about \u201abypassing\u2019 is actually the reason for hacking -\u00a0for opencare. Once you certify your product is \u201afrozen\u2019. Yes it\u2019s about bypassing &gt;100k euro of CE marking expenses of a product which the user has to pay (<a href=\"/t/fes-for-foot-drop/667\">https://edgeryders.eu/en/fes-for-foot-drop</a>). You can't meet individual requirements because youll lose certification.\n\n<strong>However you have a point. Help us to find a way to ennsure that this is legal and how participants can be ensured in case of accidents. Please?</strong>\n\n* don't get your point about IP!???? We are in open context, free,\n\n<strong>* Responsibility and lawsuits. I can see you are a lawyer mind so please help out on this point? (Yes the idea is that the paricipant is fully responsible) How does the makerspaces go about this issue (@Costantino)?</strong>\n\n<strong>*\u00a0</strong>\u201aDisabled ones\u2019 are in this case people, the participants, looking\u00a0for a alleviation for lack of body function. In contrast to established health care (\u00a0were the patient is often a passive receiver patiently waiting for ....), the WeHandU (see above reply)\u00a0philosophy is NOT to decide what is best for a patient.\u00a0Rather a person living with an impairment is looking for a way to resolve that HE/SHE considers a problem and hopefully resolve/alleviate it in a creative environment\u00a0(I am often contacted by such people). The \u201anot-patient\u2019 but participant is... a participant. People not \u201awanting any aid\u2019 (and they are most) will not come in WeHandU.\u00a0(BTW. Disabled people is not existing in the modern vocabulary)\n\n*\u00a0Solutions not marketed is\u00a0a complex one. As graduate student I believed (was taught) that if it works it will be sold. That\u2019s not the way of business. Healthcare is business. Hard cold \u00a0business. A businees where 90%\u00a0 of the healthcare budget is spend on a solution that does not work. 90% (EU data) is spend on treating cronic diseases. Why are they cronic? Because the cure we are paying is not working... ok I\u2019m being cheeky here ;-) \u00a0\u00a0\n\nIf you study the dropped foot stimulators, invented 50 years ago, there is a ton of scientific work that demonstrates efficiency. Its provided by NHS in england, but not in the rest of europe. Why?\n\n*\u00a0Optimistic research. No, rather pragmatic -\u00a0If something does not work try something different. The different is to eliminate the last variable (confounder is the term) not yet controlled in 50years of research: FAILING INSTITUTIONS (article on edgeryders).\n\nWhat would you suggest as a cut off for a clinically relevant change?\n\nHow many people regaining some hand function? How many people walking yet some years before they end in a wheelchair? Would 10 suffice or do we need 100.mio (A cervical spinal cord injury cost society approx. 1mio$/year)\u00a0\n\nWhat if\u00a0one of them was you? Would the existence of\u00a0WeHandU space be justified it it could preserve you some personal independence?\n\nWe have a choice here: continue spending millions on research refining (reinventing) technology (<a href=\"http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-01/kf-kfa010716.php\">http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-01/kf-kfa010716.php</a>).

What you want to work on is \"Economics\", not \"Science Fiction\" per se. This is an event not for pure imagination, but with potential real-world implications for our economic system. So it's an \"Economics Lab\", not a \"Science Fiction Lab\".\n\n2. Now we need to integrate \"Science Fiction\" as an attribute. My feeling is that \"Sci-Fi\" is a better candidate to serve the function of an attribute than the long form.\n\n3. This way, we also get around using \"Economics\" as a weird specifier of \"Science Fiction\". It cannot be understood as an attribute because it's clearly a noun. Two nouns in a row of which one is a specifier of the other is weird and not intuitively understandable. I guess that's why people intuitively switched to saying \"economic science-fiction\", which is wrong for other reasons as it would be understood as \"resource efficient science fiction\" or the like.\n\n4. To me, a lab is an institution, not a type of event. It's permanent. A workshop would be the type of event you can hold in a lab, but it's unfortunately much overused.

They use culture as a tool to make a difference wherever they are. CIN now wish to level up and structure their organisation as a sustainable, project building community. I\u2019ll let @Filomena, one of the core members who also has been on edgeryders for some time, introduce CIN better. \n\nThis webinar happens on the 10th and 11th next week at 18:00, in 90 minute sessions. We will touch on the following aspects: deep knowledge about what keeps groups together; what makes a good community manager; the social contract with your community: how members benefit but also take responsibility to contribute back; how to work at the network level and balance structure with freedom; tools to run truly open, participatory projects; how edgeryders does team coordination on a regular basis.

But the platform would be more like Babele + Goteo (Babele for the collaboration on projects strategy and implementation and Goteo on the crowdfunding).\n\n- this is not just a platform where you see current NGO's and citizens see to which NGO they want to give their 2%. This could be cool, but it is not a revolutionary value added platform, existing NGO's are already collecting 2% from citizens, they do not necessary need a platform for that. Such a platform could be implemented without the municipality, and just by contacting NGO's like Alex Stef suggested..\n\nActually when I thought this project, it was more for new ideas, grassroots initiatives, that maybe did not have yet a legal entity and that could get the money from the citizens the 2% that are already taxed in order to come to life - and solve the problem of no finance. This is why actually I was suggesting that it needed to be made by the local municipality or institution: the local municipality would get the 2% (I have to check if in Romania, as in Italy, the municipality can get money as well), and then they would allocate the money to the projects based on the votes of the citizens. This is where it gets really interesting: you allow to people to really choose local projects to solve local problems that they want to see alive, and you have local social innovators that maybe do not have a legal entity, maybe yes, to implement them. This is where you are getting smart, in collaborating with institutions, rather than avoiding them.\n\nIn this platform thus: grassroots initiatives that do not have a legal entity could get financed through the 2% that is already taxed by the government to solve local problems.\n\n \n\nIf you find it interesting, come to discuss it through this Thursday at the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/883779598356674/\">collaborative pizza event</a> at Nod Makerspace... and bring your pizza ingredient with you :-)\n\nRuxandra", "created_at": "2015-07-13 12:09:00", "updated_at": "2018-03-04 09:09:20.700352", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 488, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 11.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9071, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 1951, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>I'm in!

There is a very serious case we can make for this thing to be useful.</span>\n</li>\n\n<li><span>However, keeping the community going has costs. After the spinoff from the Council of Europe\u00a0they were borne by some of the more committed Edgeryders. We will presumably continue to do our part, but we need to go up a couple of notches. This means arise against\u00a0activities that are well-loved and appreciated by the community, such as community management and the Living On The Edge events.</span></li>\n\n<li><span>Edgeryders is <em>already</em> a community, whereas SC4SV is not. The first has a name, an online presence, and more than 1,000 people that,\u00a0at some point, decided to associate themselves with it. Some of the core members of the community have pretty good social media traction, and might be willing to help. By running a crowdfunding campaign as a community, we'll share a learning experience across all of us, not just the SC4SV group.</span></li>\n\n<li><span>Edgeryders, I would argue, has a potential for sustainability. I mean, look at it: we have a client and a paid gig (<a href=\"/t/the-edgeryders-guide-to-the-baltic/781\">Mission: Baltic</a>) and we don't even exist yet!</span></li>\n\n<li><span>Finally, all Edgeryders activities also contribute to SC4SV. There might be some SC4SV-specific costs \u2013 some software, a dedicated person \u2013 but I would argue those would be easier to fund from more traditional channels. Funding agencies are happy to fund <em>projects</em>, but no one wants to fund the <em>organizations themselves</em> \u2013 a couple of core salaries, a place to meet, whatever. </span></li>\n\n</ol>\n\n\u200bAll things considered,\u00a0<span>I would use crowdfundiing to\u00a0get\u00a0the Edgeryders thing off the ground, and take care of SC4SV through a dedicated funding channel.

You can see 2 photos of the exhibition here: https://marshmallowsg.wixsite.com/buildpeace  (this is a draft website that needs to still be finished)  You see there my daughter and some screens and projections.  We do this together.  She is a Minecraft expert and she supports me to help others with the computers in case it is too much for me when there is too much people.  We do exercises in which we use co-creation of the ideal home place for a person on paper, lego, and also on Minecraft.  We learn to co-draw, co-decide, co-design, co-budget.\n\n- As researcher: I have for example co-written 4 projects to the Nesta call on Collective Intelligence.  I hope that at least one of them gets some budget.  One of the project ideas is about collective decision making tools, and a study of polarization/collaboration.  Another one is related to intergenerational collective decision making.  Another one is about Decentralized/Distributed Governance, and another one about Swarm Human Intelligence.  Probably one of this projects ideas or the combination of all of them could be submitted to a H2020 call on democracy, collective decision making.  We will be looking into this with @soenke \n\n- As a speaker, I work mostly on awareness, showing to people that we can transform the way we decide and do it collaboratively, also transform our organizations and in general society, for more participation, and horizontal organizations.  Talks vary from TEDx, to other international conferences on Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, and Peace Movements.  I can give a list of these but will only post the TEDx for now:  https://youtu.be/fqR8OQ1u63Q\n\nI hope to collaborate with more people over here <3\nInitially I feel that the collaboration will start with Soenke, probably with a follow up event in Brussels.

I would suggest a second editor to edit interview transcripts, where the article would take on a Q&amp;A format.

For those of you who came last year, it\u2019s very close to Le Space and the beer place we visited after the sessions - and a walking distance to the Grand Place. [Au Quai](https://www.facebook.com/collectif.auquai/) is an 11-year-old occupation, with a team of artists/activists running it as a community space that serves the neighborhood. We\u2019re planning to involve the group in the sessions as well, as they have a lot of experience to share regarding building sustainable co-housing/co-working projects that serve the community, but struggle for survival (what\u2019s important is that Au Quai will be closed sometime soon, as the building was sold to a new owner - the collective tried to purchase the space, but it was never seen as viable for a loan and well, you know the rest). I hope you will love it!\n\nThe space has two floors. On the first floor, there is a cafeteria and a podium, where we can hold bigger sessions. The room is equipped with a projector and speakers, and black curtains, so we can use it both for plenaries and for screenings. It has huge windows and a small corner where you can unplug and spend some time scribbling or just sipping a coffee.\n\nThe second floor is divided into two spaces - one that you enter directly from the stairs, big enough to hold a session for 30 people. If it\u2019s cold and we cannot manage to keep it warm, we\u2019ll move to a bio coffee shop/eatery Belo, downstairs. They have quite beautiful sandwiches, and coffee is cheap. And the second space on that same floor is isolated and has a great heater, and it can easily hold 60 people. It will be equipped with both projector and speakers. \n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/0/0f971010df712c275b13475a960ad8c8ca906e48.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"690\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e145e27ecffba93635bb701901a38c7f280afd5e.jpg\" width=\"517\" height=\"690\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5aa40def06d292c242c06568c850fd4abfb7b0dd.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"517\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/2/21aad9f46549734dfbe4d77ca2c9aa76032f75c5.jpg\" width=\"517\" height=\"690\">\n\nAll we need to do now is to look at the plan and assign the sessions so that those of you who need equipment will have access to right spaces. There might be limitations with Internet connectivity - we\u2019re working on it, but in case, be prepared to spend some time offline. At the end, that\u2019s why we\u2019re coming to Brussels, right? \n\nThe first day of the event will still happen in La Serre - as planned. We will have an urban game in the neighborhood and some sessions in the venue.\n\n**Food**\n\nWe\u2019re inviting one of the local chefs to cook lunch for us on the **Day1**, in La Serre. Afterwards, we\u2019ll run the kitchen ourselves in the evening to prepare the dinner. It seems like the food team will only be needed on the first day to make the dinner. We still need volunteers for that mission. \n\nOn the **Day 2**, lunch will be delivered to Au Quai by the same chef as on the Day 1 (I and Noemi tried, he cooks very well), and in the evening we will go back to La Serre to taste the recuperated wonders of [Up Cooking](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=487587141573451) chefs. We need 3-5 people to help them with cooking - it will be fun. \n\nOn the **third day** - you\u2019re free to pick yourself what and where to eat (I will have a list of recommendations if needed). \n\n**Party**\n\nWe\u2019re also sorting out the party - I\u2019m working on that with the Brussels based collective[ Rebel Up](http://www.rebelup.org/). These guys specialize in discovering African music and promoting unknown artists. We invited [Otim Alpha](https://nyegenyegetapes.bandcamp.com/album/gulu-city-anthems), Ugandan group playing a blend of traditional and electronic music, as well as a [Dr. Kwest](https://drkwest.bandcamp.com/album/808-bantou), producer of Congolese music, and two other DJs from the Nyege Nyege Tapes.

I am no expert, but I did read [Jacobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_and_Life_of_Great_American_Cities). Initially (and for quite some time), gentrification _increases_ diversity. At step 0 you have just poor people in a poor neighborhood. At step 1, you have those, but also some people who are income-poor, but social capital- and time-rich show up, in search of cheap space. These would be the pioneer species of the urban ecosystem, the artists. They have little money, but they are not forced to spend all their waking time flipping burgers to support their families. At step 2, you have the former, plus people like me show up. Little more disposable income, enjoy the diversity (and the cheap spaces). We bring to the neighborhood demand for stuff that was previous not available, like organic food and yoga classes. Promptly, someone shows up to supply these. \n\nAt this point, the diversity is maximal. There are some winners, also among the locals that were already there: they gain more diverse social relationships, some more local jobs show up. The biggest winners are those of the locals that were able to afford buying real estate, because the value of their property goes way up. \n\nInequalities also go up. But, if you buy into the biological metaphors I like so much, this is to be expected. The ecosystem becomes more rich and complex, so it can now support more species: earthworms make the ground more fertile, which leads to grains and trees, which leads to insects who eat the leaves, which leads to birds who eat the insects, and so on. Ok, that's probably a terrible defense of gentrification, but complexity and inequalities DO go together in many natural systems.", "created_at": "2019-09-26 11:49:26.891171", "updated_at": "2019-09-26 11:51:32.122764", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 322, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 16.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [59947], "is_reply_to": [59947], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33819, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 6579, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Welcome on board.</b>\n\n@CarolineM it is very nice to meet you, hearb great things about you.\n\nFrom your work so far, have you seen how the \"larger audience\" responds positively to new formats?

They [concluded](https://twitter.com/DeepMindAI/status/1101514121563041792) that \u201cfeedback loops in recommendation systems can give rise to \u2018echo chambers\u2019 and \u2018filter bubbles,\u2019 which can narrow a user\u2019s content exposure and ultimately shift their worldview.\u201d\n\nThe model didn\u2019t take into account how the recommendation system influences the kind of content that's created. In the real world, AI, content creators, and users heavily influence one another. Because AI aims to maximize engagement, hyper-engaged users are seen as \u201cmodels to be reproduced.\u201d AI algorithms will then favor the content of such users.\n\nThe feedback loop works like this: (1) People who spend more time on the platforms have a greater impact on recommendation systems. (2) The content they engage with will get more views/likes. (3) Content creators will notice and create more of it. (4) People will spend even more time on that content. That's why it\u2019s important to know who a platform's hyper-engaged users are: They\u2019re the ones we can examine in order to predict which direction the AI is tilting the world.\"\n\nSo in other words, what we see is largely a product from people with nothing better to do with their time..", "created_at": "2019-07-13 14:35:24.177986", "updated_at": "2019-07-13 16:15:09.021080", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 260, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 23.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [56593], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 59583, "user_id": 60, "topic_id": 10817, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Thanks Nadia! \nAlso how would you describe this conference?\nThe conference to/that/for .. ?", "created_at": "2019-09-18 13:58:35.605730", "updated_at": "2019-09-18 13:58:35.605730", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 14, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 11.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [59577], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 56634, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 10342, "post_number": 7, "raw": "Right.

As a researcher for the [LABCMO](http://cmo.uqam.ca/) (common Lab between Universit\u00e9 Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al and Universit\u00e9 Laval), I am studying some makerspace in Qu\u00e9bec. My interest in Biohacking is due to my background in biochemistry. But for my thesis my focus is Africa, that is why the topic is: \nInfluences des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s traditionnelles africaines sur la contribution des tiers-lieux de fabrication num\u00e9rique au d\u00e9ploiement de la modernit\u00e9.\n\nEnqu\u00eate sur l\u2019organisation, les pratiques, les valeurs et les objets de 3 Fablabs du Burkina Faso, du Cameroun et du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal \n\nThe government support I am talking about here is : policies to frame community-science action ; encourage the broad adoption of these local initiatives inside the country. Only official communiqu\u00e9 can change the life of many people. Then funding can be useful\u2026\n\nIn my context, international partnership is very helpful, because our Government doesn\u2019t support open science and does not seem aware of this field or it is not their priority. But 1) International Organisation used to choose government as the first partner\u2026like that, be sure all the support will not reach to the population. For me it is not the good partner to bring impact where it is needed. 2) International Organization don\u2019t know our realities. They don\u2019t take in consideration that even if you are working with a local collaborator, the traditional structure of African society (family, clan, tribe, ethnic) still has a big influence in our manner to think, manage and organize. 3) It is very easy for Africans in the diaspora to be in touch with international organization and get their support. But for those who cannot travel (it is the case for many leaders and members of Civil Society Organisation (CSO)) ; the international support happens randomly or never.      \nMe, Mayor (lol)\u2026I am Cameroonian and 34 years old. I don\u2019t want to expose the political environment of  my country here. But for a few notes, our President has spent 35 years in power (older than me) ; officially multipartism exists, but the President party is like the unique ; be Mayor means join this Party. And frankly, I am not sure that I will feel comfortable in this system. That is why I work directly with the community through advice and education and my philosophy is that local developement can be ensured only directly with/and inside the community. To support my action I have created in 2010 this school (legal) http://www.zikulumarie-claire.com/, with like 250 students every year. In this school I am doing formal education (nursery and primary) like that, I am training our future leader. I am doing informal and long life education through workshops and seminars, to empower people. I am also doing hygiene sensibilisation, with my mother, who is a retired nurse, we used to run this course : EVA (Education \u00e0 la Vie et \u00e0 l\u2019Amour), for sexual hygiene. @noemi  I have too much to tell, but through these actions, I feel my impact more tangible and authentic than to be mayor under this system. Perhaps one day, if the system change.  \nAll these reasons explain why I took the decision to do my research in Open Science and particularly DIY ; technology is a good way for communities to ensure themselves their own local development. That is why in December I will launch inside my community, one [science shop](http://www.livingknowledge.org/science-shops/about-science-shops/) combined with a lab, for the rapprochement science-society.\n\nDefinitely, I really want to join you in Brussels and share with you.

From a humanities background, he moved into economics and specialized into evaluation and monitoring. This enabled him to work independently, never suffering a dry spell for 15 years. In later years this took the form of a company.\n\nCapacity works for Renato: he can do things that long-time employees of public AND private organizations can't. They depend on people like him to function. So Renato and his peers can consistently make a living.\n\nBut not all is well. After 15 years, Renato still feels that he is not safe from the risk of being exploited. A kind of reverse meritocracy seems to be at work: he and his peers are ever-precarious, though they are indispensable to do the work that for-life employees are unable to do; and the labor market that awaits his children is ready to make them choose between professional integrity and job security.\n\nNo, not all is well. My comment: the dual labor market that has been built in Italy is very likely non-meritocratic. Trade unions have probably played a negative role, retreating to defending the insiders rather than extending opportunities for all (everybody remembers the strikes to defend the unstatinable salary levels at Alitalia, that was losing tankfuls of taxpayer money added to the famous 1.9 trillion euro of Italian sovereing debt).\n\n", "created_at": "2011-12-10 16:00:45", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:58.861038", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 268, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20113, "user_id": 3268, "topic_id": 4880, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b> Metropolitan Community Clinic at Helliniko</b>\n\n<div class=\"text-entity expanded\" data-block=\"text-entity\">\n\nThis is an extremely interesting development which shows how collaboration is evolving at pace before our eyes: social media and internet driven; bottom up and middle outwards rather than top down; redefining value, cost and currency; beginning to redefine what is acceptable, allowed and treated as 'legal'; finding and using not only skilled partners but also skilled and well placed partners who are willing and able to act as brokers within the system to get things done.\u00a0\n\n</div>", "created_at": "2016-04-23 11:59:09", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:51.951413", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 99, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 51.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 41741, "user_id": 3811, "topic_id": 8069, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Actually @aishacvertus the goal is first to chat here.

Otherwise we have only two types of access restricted categories: company-only categories (incl. the \"Edgeryders Administration\" one you refer to, now renamed to [Company](/c/workspaces/company)) and collaborators-only categories.

The federated platform system is our main offering from now on: the \"break-out category\" system could not be implemented in a clean way and is no longer on offer, while the \"own category on edgeryders.eu\" offer is of course still possible but clients will rarely want that.\n\nAnything else, esp. if and how much technical support the client can get, would have to be negotiated with the client and put into a contract.

Skilled workers, migrants, young families, single moms or dads, retired people, we all deserve better. \n\nEdgeryders is an international community working for social change, with core members and a growing network in Brussels. After several years of thinking about housing and new living spaces, we think we have found a way.\n\n**Are you exploring co-housing in the present or future, in a way that suits your personal needs?**\n**Do you dream of ownership and perhaps prosperity, shared with a group of like minded people?**\n**Are you curious about how to live more affordably and ecologically?**\n\n## On 24 October, people from all walks of life meet to share with one another their dreams and aspirations for better living. Are you one of them? \n\nThis workshop is an occasion to meet and share ideas with people who are dreaming of a new lifestyle, and learn about an opportunity for the group to access shared property in the city. We will meet in an informal, social space, an existing co-housing project in Brussels. In a facilitated conversation, participants will share experiences in co-living and think how it can work better for each. After, the group is presented with an opportunity to collectively pursue a new kind of residential space - The Reef (see below). \n\nTo ensure each participant benefits from the experience, after the workshop we will assemble the findings from the conversation and present them as a practical recommendation for living in the future. This will enable those who wish to continue together to design their future home in Brussels.\n\nTIME AND PLACE: 18:00 - 21:00 at LaMAB, La Maison \u00e0 Bruxelles ASBL. \n\nREGISTRATION. Please let us know your interest in the topic by filling in a registration form. Pick one of the two forms below. After you register, wait for our confirmation (number of participants is limited!)

The event is part of Edgeryders effort to build The Reef Community in a series of 3 workshops. The Reef starts in 2019-2020 and it is an open project. We are looking to connect a group of people who contribute to making a new kind of space: a future residential space for the 99%. Currently, The Reef is in the design phase and anyone is welcome to get involved as a workshop contributor, a future inhabitant, or just a supporter!

At the same time I'm scared of using the wrong tool for a job (\u2026 been there, done that \u2026 the Drupal based site was a disaster from 2012 to 2017).\n\nNow I'm not going to tell people what technology to choose for _their_ Edgeryders software projects. There would be some efficiencies to gain, but I'm too anarchist to accept people doing that to me, so I won't do it either. The principle is instead that everyone who chooses a technology makes a best judgment after looking at both the problem and our existing software landscape, then choosing something that fits in best.\n\nSo when I did that when tasked with the NGI platform / fa\u00e7ade website, my considerations were as follows:\n\n* **Open source.** That's obvious. For the NGI platform, this was even in the grant agreement. It also affected the choice of template in the end (plain vanilla Bootstrap), eliminating commercial templates based on Bootstrap but under proprietary licences.\n\n* **Hostable on the Edgeryders server.** We have a \"one server for everything\" approach and all software used for Edgeryders projects should be on that server. Except software we use as SaaS of course.\n\n    Software that is distributed as Docker images etc. is not an immediate fit. (Discourse itself also comes as a Docker image in the most usual form, but we figured out how to install it on an existing Linux server.)\n\n* **Language choice.** Our software landscape is mainly Ruby (because Discourse) and Python (Graphryder, Alberto's scripts, Dynalist Companion etc.). Reasonable exceptions are ok, as long as the language is common and / or simple enough to allow DIY maintenance of the software.\n\n    Another aspect of language choice is if it fits into the targeted open source software ecosystem. Because it's a waste of resources to develop a good open source software that is then used only inside the organization because it somehow does not fit for the audience. So for a software that interacts with Discourse, Ruby would be an obvious choice, as it makes it easy to work with for people who know their way around developing with Discourse already.\n\n* **Tool for the job.** The job is to serve a relatively simple website without end user features to enter data / create content. The website should be updated frequently though, with new data from Discourse.\n\n* **Keeping it simple.** The right tool for a job is typically the simplest one that is intended for such a job, while being extendable enough for expectable future jobs of a different kind. But software that tries to be so extendable that it is \"ready to do everything\" is often not a good tool for any job. That was the mistake we made by choosing Drupal: wanting a system that can be extended by power users without programming lead to choosing a hyper-complex software that came apart at its seams, with thousands of unfixed bugs that are never fixed because people are just overwhelmed by them. And because it tried to be everything at the same time, it made even the simplest tasks like templating complicated.\n\n    I'm not against a software \"because it's complicated\", but when it is \"too complex for the job at hand\". Discourse itself uses [React](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(JavaScript_library)) internally, quite similar in architecture to what Vue.js does. We're happy with it there, because (1) it's useful there, and (2) it is used to its full potential inside Discourse. It comes with its challenges (like the shadow DOM when debugging), but these we accept as it plays out all of its advantages as well.\n\n    Now for the case of Vue.js: I had to install two different package managers, then it installed 600+ packages, then it compiled 300+ things, then it started a server process. We need a static website, without interdependent UI elements / widgets. There does not have to be a server process. There do not have to be 600+ packages of anything. For _this_ type and size of problem, Vue.js is overkill by about one order of magnitude.\n\n* **Maintainability.** Ease of maintenance _by others_ in the organization is another concern. As in, \"do not create software that depends on yourself\". We have fared well so far with a strong DIY approach, which means: we need to be able to maintain our own tech infrastructure based on documentation and in-house skills.\n\n* **Security considerations.** For practical reasons and because we don't handle sensitive data, this is not that much of a concern. But it's good to stay away from things like: WordPress and a lot of plugins, many of them no longer maintained. And if there is a choice, static websites are great from this perspective due to the minimal attack surface.\n\n* **I don't care about trends.** I do something when I understand its benefits for the situation at hand, not because everyone else does it. Worked well so far, so I apply it to software as well.\n\nSo that's how I decided back then, and thinking about it again, I stand by that. Again, this is not to tell others what tech to choose when. As always it's \"Use your best judgment, and I'll trust that you do.\" But I think it's still useful to have an exchange about these matters, as we could happen to learn from each other how to decide these things.\n\nI think we should approach this dual implementation as an experiment: just as in the many redundant open source projects, it will only emerge over time which was the right decision. It may even happen that each system finds a different niche and they keep coexisting.

In Edgeryders we _always_ struggle with process adoption. This is because we cannot stomach the idea of actually trying to manage operations from a center, even at this modest scale, and let alone the one we are trying to achieve. So, the only way to go is decentralize, and if you are decentralized you cannot enforce an information or workflow. The nodes of the network will only invest in linking if they can see a very clear benefit from doing so. This has made us technological minimalists, and conservative when it comes to adopting any shiny new tool. \n\nIn many cases, unfortunately, the benefits of doing something only materialize if a critical mass of nodes in the network coordinate in doing it. Those cases are where a few people unwilling to adopt can jeopardize the whole scheme simply by doing nothing. In those cases, @matthias and I try and look for a subset of participants for which adoption makes sense regardless of what anyone else does. If we find it, we are more willing to take the risk, because those people can break the waiting game of \"I'll do it if you do, and you'll do it if I do it\". I find [this paper](http://chwe.net/michael/s.pdf) quite useful to think about these things: the math is overkill for our small efforts, but the language of minimal sufficient networks, local mobilization and efficient seeding does suggest ways to go about adoption of processes and tools when no cohercion is possible.", "created_at": "2018-06-18 20:39:43.339886", "updated_at": "2018-06-18 20:39:43.339886", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 310, "wiki": false, "reads": 20, "score": 19.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [45711], "is_reply_to": [45711], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 71710, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 12885, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Everyone is called on to provide ideas for anti-pandemic tools and solutions until (Fri) 2020-03-20 12:00 CET, and also everyone is called on to work in the 48 hours afterwards to make these ideas a reality.

Also they provide [a list of resources](https://wirvsvirushackathon.org/ressourcen/) that were developed during similar hackathons that happened in Estonia and Poland already.\n\nThe website is in German, but my guess is that you can safely ignore the language barrier because this is a crisis and the old rules and expectations went out the window.

If you have not been checking out Edgeryders since July 11th, you must have gotten that feeling of opening a familiar door to an unfamiliar room. I know I did! Here's what happened: Edgeryders, my friends, is growing. It is growing in numbers: we are pushing 4,000 accounts now, with close to 30,000 written contributions and, by my own rough estimate, maybe 6 million words.\n\nBut, more importantly, we are growing in *reach*. As old-time community members know, back in 2013 we created a [social enterprise](/social-enterprise) to act as our community's infrastructure. This company, also called Edgeryders, is also growing. As it grows, it becomes better at connecting our projects and initiatives for change to powerful, established organisations. And connections breeds alliances: the Edgeryders vision has always been about coalitions for positive change between the vast resources of society's center, with its corporations and institutions, and the ability and need for \"deep innovation\" of society's edges. The [OpenCare](/opencare-intro) project has been, and still is, incredibly generative. It already spawned [The Reef](/t/6239), and more initiatives are in the pipeline. \n\nAs part of this growth, we have outgrown our old Drupal  7 online platform. Back in 2013, we chose it for its extreme flexibility of use. We were not at all sure how we would end up using it: we knew technology and its user base co-evolve, so we chose a platform that would not tie our hands. After four years of extensive testing, we now do know what we Edgeryders do online. We, it turns out, **share knowledge, learn from each other and form alliances, through respectful, truth-oriented debate**. \n\nSo, we decided to decamp to a new platform that puts debate front and center. It is, as always, open source software, based on Discourse ([here](https://github.com/edgeryders/discourse) is the GitHub repo). It will take a bit of getting used to, but those of us involved in pre-testing adjusted very fast, and we know absolutely love it. Give it a try! As always, [get in touch](https://edgeryders.eu/t/contact-info/39) if you experience any trouble.\n\nHere is what you need to know:\n\n* **Your edgeryders.eu login and password work as normal**. One exception: if your username contains anything that is not a Roman letter (a-z, A-Z) or a digit (0-9), you have to replace each of these characters with an underscore. So `Qu\u00edntus-Fabius Maximus` becomes `Qu_ntus_Fabius_Maximus`. (Or you can use your registered e-mail address instead of your username for login.)\n\n* **All content has been imported. All authorship information has been preserved**. Your content is still acknowledged as yours, and you retain intellectual property rights on it. The Creative Commons Attribution license used on the old platform also is maintained for all content.\n\n* **We have rolled out an ethical consent funnel**. It is a two-questions quiz that replaces the \"I agree to the terms and conditions\" box to tick.

What I see as the biggest improvement so far is moving from pure URL + XPath based annotation anchors to those that identify the Drupal entity and use Xpath relative to the start of the node's / comment's text only. Means, synonymous URLs and template changes don't invalidate annotations anymore. That change should find its way upstream \u2026\n\nRe. annotations for PDF, I see you use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF.js\">PDF.js</a>. Adding XPath referenced annotations to PDF.js's output runs the danger of invalidating annotations when teh PDF.js output rendering is changed on version updates. A workaround would be generating the PDF.js HTML5 output <em>once</em> and saving it as node content. But I think the true solution would be sequential word numbers, added to the output by a PDF.js option.\n\nRandom word IDs, as you see us talking about for Open Ethnographer, ain't an option here as PDF.js would not the ones to use from last time. They are not needed either, as PDFs are not meant to change.\n\nThe interesting point is that in our annotator Drupal module rework, we probably should keep the door open for both options (sequential and random word IDs). You made your point still in time :) and of course you're welcome to contribute both ideas and code. We're still in the budget, so if you can come up with a clever idea how to reuse the Open Ethnographer approach for what you need later, you can get paid for implementing it yourself.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-01-02 22:31:28", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:47.488628", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 304, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [14390], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 66247, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 11954, "post_number": 6, "raw": "Ok, @TamaraVuk, makes sense.

What percentage will Edgeryders take to cover its expenses?

It is a last-ditch attempt to save the \"From talk to action\" OpenCare paper, that has run into several problems. I still believe it is a good idea, and would love to read it. So, we are proposing a road map to other people in the team. If everybody agrees to it, we can still deliver the paper. If not, we will abandon it.\n\nIt seems to me we have all the materials for this paper. Those we do not have already, we soon will, because they are being prepared as part of various activities scattered across the project. \n\n\n### Why bother?\n\n* Because this is the paper everybody wants to read. It vindicates the CAPS approach; of sinks it, if its results are negative. \n* Because it's good for project impact\n* Because it's good for across-consortium collaboration, which reviewers asked of us (it involves researchers from ER, WeMake and ScImpulse).\n\n\n### Co-authors\n\nThis comes first, because it is the call to arms. If you do not respond, or respond negatively, the paper will not happen. Of course, we will respect your reasons. The co-authors are to be:\n\n* Ezio (main author)\n* Noemi\n* @federico_monaco\n* @markomanka\n* @winnieponcelet (this might come as a surprise, since I have not talked to Winnie about this at all).\n\n@amelia has declined to co-author. However, she is still important to the paper, since it will re-use and cite her OpenCare ethno report. Noemi and I take responsibility for \"interpreting\" the report in terms of the paper. \n\n\n### Title\n\nI propose \"From talk to action? Digital platforms as enablers of communities of care: a service design approach\"\n\n\n### Background\n\n* the crisis of all the traditional ways of thinking and practicing care\n* the challenge of facing the care issue using open models (and hacking approaches)\n* social forms and service encounters in care empowering ecosystems\n\n\n### Hypothesis\n\n**Hypothesis background**: Open care is based on an ecosystem of social forms and technical infrastructures. They are its dynamic cultural socio-technical infrastructure.\nOpen care requires a variety of social forms. Some of them are the traditional ones (as: families, care-related institutions, business, and NGOs) some of them are newer ones, specifically supporting the open care open nature and practice. They  are: (1) dedicated result-oriented communities and (2) communities of interest. \n\n**Specific hypothesis**: Result-oriented communities practice collaboration to actually deliver care. Communities of interest practice collaboration that cuts across result-oriented communities. This collaboration results on sensemaking and strategising, and helps result-oriented communities to thrive and evolve in the most promising direction (avoiding the traps of the neo-liberal thinking and practicing). \n\n\n### Aims\n\nTo verify the previous hypotheses with a focus on: how a community of interest can be set up, kept alive and become a space of possibilities for different kinds of conversations, capable to trigger, sustain and orient a multiplicity result-oriented communities. In particular, the paper tracks and discusses how information and calls to action percolates from one type of community to the other.\n\n\n### Architecture\n\nThe paper consists of:\n\n1. A model that resulted over the past years from Ezio looking at OpenCare from the perspective of a service designer.\n\n2. Evidence on OpenCare itself as a community of interest. This results from the observations of all of us, and particularly from @amelia's ethno work.\n\n3. Three stories of action that intersected OpenCare. These are: collaboration in the physical WeMake space; Open Insulin; and Open&Change.\n\nThe main idea is that the model is applied to the stories to falsify the specific hypothesis. In other words: do the stories confirm the idea that collective intelligence platforms (communities of interest) contribute to the work of the result oriented communities of care?\n \n\n### Rough table of contents\n\n1. Understanding open care (many example, introduce OpenCare etc.) - care of @ezio_manzini and @noemi\n\n2. Modelling open care (Ezio's matrix) \u2013 care of Ezio and Noemi\n\n3. Story one: WeMake, collaboration in a makerspace \u2013 care of @federico_monaco \n\n4. Story two: Open Insulin, distributed collaboration across several spaces \u2013 care of @winnieponcelet\n\n5. Story three: Open&Change, interaction rules to foster common action \u2013 care of @markomanka\n\n6. Discussion and conclusions \u2013 care of Ezio and Noemi. Everyone else welcome to step in. \n\n\n### Timeline\n\nA draft of everything except the conclusions should be ready by November 15th. Conclusions and final editing will happen 15 November-15 December. \n\nAre you in? Or do we drop it?

Without a sufficient food supply, my family and neighbors cannot live. If you are lucky enough, you can <del>~~pretend~~</del> <ins>demand</ins> more, i.e. that the food is not only sufficient but it is safe, affordable, nutritious and 'healthy' (this is a bit more complex). At the national and global level, food security unbalances contribute to building up trade and production networks that are quite interesting to follow if you want to see where power is and how it is changing (suggestion: give a look at Turkey). \nFood surplus is inherent to food security. Without surplus that makes trade possible, you are destined to spend your whole life - every single minute - only producing food for you and your family and it will never be as diverse as prescribed by decent diets. Maybe it's something beautiful. I would not like to live like that. Of course, we can talk of many forms of trade - in the end it is based on different social conceptions of trust. You can trade with the farmer behind the corner and do it with no safety standards (@Dragan_Jonic - interesting the story of the organic certification with no HACCP - to be checked - likely the flaw is in the certification scheme rather than in the HACCP) because you know him and you trust him. Or, you can trade futures on wheat at the CBOT. Those are two extreme examples. The point is that both are trust-based systems. On trust you can build markets (small, big, veg, org, cert, no cert) and the challenge is not only to make a connection possible among those markets, but also make them cooperate. As a friend of mine puts it [here](https://www.iris-france.org/150047-le-risque-cest-linterdependance-sans-la-cooperation/), today the risk is being interdependent without trust and cooperation.

Alves & Salum think the next wave is AI & medical tech -- these obviously require a high level of social infrastructure to build from, unlike Walkaway. I'm still inclined to think that a supportive society comes from well-supported, reasonably well-adjusted people who have a crisis that creates solidarity, not from brutalized people. The best example to my mind is still WWII -- that's why you can get kibbutzim in Israel -- in both cases you get a commitment to the common good that continues for a couple of generations, but it still runs out of steam when the society gets too rich because the belief in the ideal of the community fades. Mao was right -- \"continuous revolution\" is the only way -- but it has so far proven impossible to sustain. The sole possible exception may be religious orders -- monasteries -- think about \"A Canticle for Liebowitz\" -- but even there it is a commune to preserve something of society to rebuild in future, and then is no longer necessary... the problem is to preserve for all foreseeable time the commitment to the community by the great majority of individuals in society.

My personal take, which I debated with John this morning, is this: to a certain extent, you can delegate to the conversation environment the function of weeding out the misunderstanding. For example, in Edgeryders we insist on criticism as positive contribution. This means that, if you criticise me in this space, you don't need to do as much tiptoeing around the issue for fear of being misunderstood.\n\nOne small correction: Edgeryders is\u00a0not so much about getting funding\u00a0as it is about getting <em>clients</em>. Clients are better then funders, because they pay you to solve their problems. So, they will give you feedback as well as money, speeding up the process with which you get better at what you do. Funders, on the other hand, tend to define what they do in terms of giving away money, and they do not care as much about what results are.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-03-01 16:45:26", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:19.115462", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 232, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 37820, "user_id": 3818, "topic_id": 7170, "post_number": 51, "raw": "Hi @noemi, hi everyone. \n\nCould you please add me in the harvest & food team ? \n\nCan help easily w/ both :)  \n\nI'll be here from wednesday to sunday.", "created_at": "2017-10-07 15:34:25.890105", "updated_at": "2017-10-07 15:34:25.890105", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 27, "wiki": false, "reads": 34, "score": 51.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31041, "user_id": 3645, "topic_id": 6258, "post_number": 15, "raw": "<b>Things to get (2)</b>\n\nHi Guys &amp; Girls\n\nSo, I browsed through the files and checked the schematics for the openDrop.

However,\n\n* Its good practive to mention it in the README, too:\n\n> Copyright 2019 Gustav Larsson, released under the GPLv3+ which is included in the file \\[LICENSE\\](LICENSE) in the git repository\n\n* I advocate to specify the license as GPLv3+ (with the plus added), which means people can relicense your code as GPLv4 if that should ever be necessary (there is lengthy discussions about it, here a quick summary without all the historic story that you can read up somewhere else https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/7759/gplv3-explicit-version-number-or-any-later-version-implications ). This of course means that you trust GNU to not mess up in the future and has the benefit that you stay compatible with future GPL versions - that are incompatible with former versions; this actually happened with GPLv2 <-> v3.\n* The Affero GPL (AGPLv3+) would (roughly speaking) require people who privately fork your project **and offer it as a service** (via the web - this is a difference to \"distributing\" the software) would also have to give you access to their changes if you ask them. Afaiu this is not a requirement for the pure GPL, where you could pimp multi-dreams and sell your service offering the improved version without showing how the improvements were implemented. Thus \"hardliners\" (like me) would probably choose the **A**GPLv3+ for web-applications.\n\nThere is a FAIF podcast that gives some general information regarding open source licensing:\n\nhttp://faif.us/cast/2016/sep/02/0x5C/", "created_at": "2019-12-13 12:57:16.049171", "updated_at": "2019-12-13 12:57:31.698080", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 284, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 27.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [67474], "is_reply_to": [67474], "is_liked_by": [4667], "is_private": false}, {"id": 74690, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 12164, "post_number": 273, "raw": "A can of mace?

Two Horizon 2020 projects were officially launched in January \u2013 [POPREBEL](https://edgeryders.eu/c/wellbeing) and [NGI Forward](https://edgeryders.eu/c/ioh), and four new proposals submitted in March and beginning of April. A lot of energy was put in building these applications, especially EPICS where @alberto is the principal investigator. The main aim of doing this is not only to work on topics we care about, but also to improve upon our research methodology and, perhaps most importantly, bring in new opportunities for our community at large.\n\nEdgeryders\u2019 role in these European research projects is that of a conveyor of large online conversations. We offer a coherent set of activities (called a *workpackage* in EU research lingo) dedicated to building online communities, to reach the voices of the people on the ground and to involve a wide range of stakeholders. This process includes an effective engagement strategy adapted to the targeted groups of each project as well as [Semantic Social Network Analysis](https://zenodo.org/record/1059029) as a unique methodology to analyze conversations and get the \u201cbig picture\u201d of the problem at hand. Our contribution has proven to be valuable for research and it feeds in the work of other partners in the consortia.\n\nSo, here is a short overview and the reasoning behind these four projects:\n\n1. **CYcle of Creativity: a Leading Open intellectual Property System for the European Union (CYCLOPS)**  / Topic: DT-GOVERNANCE-13-2019: Digitisation, Digital Single Market and European culture: new challenges for creativity, intellectual property rights and copyright.\n\n   - **WHY?** The idea of the project is to produce a better evidence-base for public and private copyright policy and general guidelines for copyright in a context of digitisation which is bringing changes throughout the creative industries making creative works available to anyone with Internet access. More people become creators but it may become harder to make a living from creativity. \n\n    - **HOW?** CYCLOPS is based on a circular, dynamic notion of creativity and innovation. A mix of complementary, qualitative and quantitative methods will help establish a more efficient Digital Single Market and develop a clear, sustainable and widely acceptable copyright system. By employing participatory research, descriptions of attitudes, problems and solutions adopted among a broad range of stakeholders will be developed. Capturing important variations in copyright systems and mapping out various stakeholders directly affected by digitisation and copyright will serve to provide insights into the challenges they face and the solutions they have come up with so that adequate business models and strategies can be identified. Finally, fundamental policy recommendations on how to reconcile disparate interests for a more sustainable, harmonised copyright system will be developed. \n\n    - **WHO?** DIW Econ, Germany (coordinator); Erasmus University Rotterdam, Netherlands; Rooter, Spain; University of Alcal\u00e1, Spain; DELab, University of Warsaw, Poland. \n\n     In this project, Edgeryders leads work package 2 (WP2), \u201cGiving all stakeholders a voice\u201d which consists of three sets of tasks focused among others on collecting ethnographic data online. We have also taken on the leading role of another workpackage (WP9), related to communication and dissemination. This will allow us to create an effective strategy to maximise the visibility of the project and its results as well as to build prototypes of Toolkits, in collaboration with Rooter, to help very small and small to medium enterprises and non-profit enterprises in setting up their activities. Lastly, the final impact conference will be an opportunity to further engage members of the community. It will target not only academics, but also \u2013 and especially \u2013 creators, fan-fiction makers, activists, politicians, data journalists. It will contribute to systematizing the existing experiences, learning from each other and boosting the creative sector by giving extra tools to the people in its frontline. \n\n\n2. **EPistemological Insights on Citizen Science (EPICS)** / Topic: SwafS-17-2019 - Consolidating and expanding the knowledge base on citizen science\n\n   - **WHY?** Considering that citizen science has a large potential for positive societal change which is currently not being realized, EPICS aims to investigate the strengths, limits and impact of citizen science to gain a deeper understanding of how it works, and how it could work better for its protagonists and society at large. Bringing together professional and citizen scientists may bring substantial benefits to science and society as a whole. \n\n    - **HOW?** By using state-of-the-art ethnographic methods and participatory design which is at the centre of the strategy. Ethnography will help us understand citizen science from the point of view of its protagonists. EPICS itself will be a citizen science project \u2013 by doing \u201ccitizen science on citizen science\u201d using citizen ethnography it will become even more participatory and open. This will allow us to explore epistemological innovation, reproducibility and accountability in citizen science. Through participatory design techniques we will explore how communities of citizen scientists can enhance their own effectiveness, resilience and their impact. Finally, since our working hypothesis is that citizen science as a participatory practice has an added democratic legitimacy, and therefore an added value for policy makers, the aim is also to influence and support policy decisions. \n\n     - **WHO?** Lisbon Council, Belgium (coordinator) ; T6 Ecosystems, Italy; Glimps, Belgium; Polytechnic Milan, Italy; Ellinogermaniki Agogi, Greece; University of Ghent, Belgium; TANT Lab, Denmark; Counter Culture Lab, US\n\n      Edgeryders is leading WP2 \u201cCitizen Science Online Community\u201d and WP5 \u201cA Citizen Ethnography of Citizen Science\u201d; having an important role in WP4 \u201cA Professional Ethnography of Citizen Science\u201d and in WP7 \u201cCommunication and Dissemination\u201d. \n\n\n3. **Understanding the EVolution of sociEty and scieNce through ciTizen Science (EVENTS)** / Topic: SwafS-20-2018-2019: Building the SwafS knowledge base - First Stage\n\n    Elements of the EPICS proposal were adapted to apply for another, two-phase call. EVENTS project is basically keeping the main general objective of EPICS: looking at the relationship between science and society through the lens of citizen science focusing on using advanced ethnographic methods and a fellowship program to support the grassroots initiatives. However, there are methodological variations, and the impact mechanism is completely different.\n\n4. **Arts Inspired Socio-Economic Transformation (AI SET)** / Topic: TRANSFORMATIONS-17: Societal Challenges in the Arts\n\n   - **WHY?** AI SET is a study about the power and impact of performance-based community art practices as processes of socio-economic transformation. It is focused on and inspired by community activities particular for a specific region in Portugal (Moliceiro region, Estarreja, Aveiro). AI SET is based on the assumption that art can be thought, planned and implemented as a tool for human development. \n\n   - **HOW?** The project will measure the impact of a large scale experimental performance artwork specifically created and designed as a research and innovation tool, focusing on Moliceiro shipbuilding tradition and its natural environment. A series of community art activities will be developed and implemented to engage local, regional, European and global communities to explore the living symbiotic relationships between Art and Life in a specific context in which ancient manufacturing and digital transformation are combined through artistic practices. \n\n   - **WHO?** Artshare Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o Tecnologia e Arte, Portugal/Belgium (coordinator); University of Aveiro, Portugal; Institut Pro Digitalni Ekonomiku, Czech Republic; Companhia de M\u00f9sica Teatral, Portugal; Vento di Venezia, Italy; Estarreja Municipality, Portugal.\n\n   This proposal was led by the [Culture Squad](https://edgeryders.eu/c/culture-squad). Edgeryders has a leading role in WP4 \u201cOnline/offline Community Conversation and Co-production\u201d aiming to map ethnographically and at a network level the European cultural actors - direct and indirect participants in place based artistic revitalization and community arts, and insert community engagement and co-production techniques at the heart of artistic experimentation. This will include collective residencies in Portugal and around Europe. Through a co-created community festival, new online/offline processes for co-producing art and cultural activities in a place will be tested. \n\n\nHopefully, in a couple of months we will get some positive news. In any case, with each new application we really learn a lot. Not only about how to satisfy the formal requirements of a specific call, but also about human aspects of engaging in this co-writing process. The right recipe for a successful application would definitely be trust among the partners of the consortium which has been built, if not based on a previous experience of working together, then on the shared values and work ethics. Choosing well whom to work with and starting on time makes the proposal automatically stronger - which is exactly what the Edgeryders Research Network will do for the upcoming calls this year. \n\nFeel free to reach out for any suggestions!", "created_at": "2019-04-21 09:56:52.262531", "updated_at": "2019-04-21 16:54:43.540796", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1438, "wiki": false, "reads": 28, "score": 295.6, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4861, 4683, 4934, 4968, 3, 2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 86324, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 13292, "post_number": 187, "raw": "These elections need to be over.

I subsequently found out more of what had taken place from personal conversations with some of the people involved, but i have still not been able to find out the full story.\n\nIt was not the disagreement that caused the split. The split was the reaction to the subsequent cover-up.\n\nThis also took place at the same time as the election of the directors to the EdgerydersLBG Company.\n\nThe EdgerydersLBG was a legal shell that was supposed to be available to the community for general use, and was supposed to work with community over-sight. There was supposed to be a community choice as to the new directors who were to act as community over-sight, but instead, the new directors were directly chosen by the current directors of the EdgerydersLBG company. This was imposed directly with no input from the Edgeryders community, and when i subsequently checked the company structures, the main shareholders of the EdgerydersLBG company, were the directors themselves, no-one else.\n\nThis basically meant that all of the rhetoric that was used about doing things differently, was lies, as the directors /owners of the company were behaving as autocratically as the institutions that they were railing against.\n\nThis was also the reason that a lot of the members from the UK left the Edgeryders community, as the behaviour of the directors of EdgerydersLBG was just \"business-as-usual-with-a-different-set-of-faces-in-charge.\"\n\nIf you want to get the full story, contact Vinay Gupta and he will be able to fill you in on the missing details, that have been disappeared down the Memory Hole.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-07-15 23:34:17", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:04.174660", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 403, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 13.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [28614], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 65138, "user_id": 4022, "topic_id": 11708, "post_number": 4, "raw": "[quote=\"felix.wolfsteller, post:2, topic:11708\"]\nOne thing I missed (but maybe its already mentioned elsewhere) is a concise statement about **Open Source / Free Software**\n[/quote]\n\nThanks!

Usage](#heading--3-3)\n\n**[4. Ordering and launching a platform](#heading--4)**\n\n------\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--1\">1. What is an Edgeryders Communities platform?</h2>\n\nAs a platform, the Edgeryders platform [edgeryders.eu](https://edgeryders.eu/) is open to a wide range of topics and contributions, without a hosting or membership fee of any kind.\n\nFor organizations who want to have more of an \"own space\", we offer two options for a collaboration:\n\n* **Option A: Own category on edgeryders.eu.** We usually accommodate collaboration requests from organizations who want to simply have discussions in their own online communities on the edgeryders.eu platform, as part of the larger Edgeryders community. For that, we provide them with an own category (also called \"discussion board\" or \"forum\" in other places) on edgeryders.eu.\n\n    _Examples:_ All projects listed in the left half of the navbar on the top of this page lead to own categories, demonstrating how such a space would look like.\n\n* **Option B: Federated Discourse platform.** We understand that the \"own category\" solution does not suit in all cases, given that a large and diverse amount of platform content can also be distracting or confusing to less experienced Internet users. Also, organizations may be interested in using the same set of tools for network and online dialogue analysis in their own online communities that we at Edgeryders use for edgeryders.eu content in our research-related projects. (We call this the [semantic social network analysis (SSNA) software stack](/c/workspaces/ssna)). And lastly, organizations will often want to put their online dialogue platform on an own domain, with an own logo. For these cases, Edgeryders offers an edgeryders.eu-like platform as a self-branded solution. Technically, that platform will be a full Discourse platform, so the client has full admin control over the site.\n\n    _Examples:_ All platforms listed in the \"Communities\" menu in the top right.\n\nPlease see the dedicated chapters below for more details about each of these options.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2. Option A: Own category on edgeryders.eu </h2>\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-1\">2.1. Description</h3>\n\nA single top-level (or sub-level) category is created for the customer, and all content of the customer's project lives there. If a top-level category is created, the customer can create sub-level categories below it in a reasonable amount (usually 10 is a reasonable limit). \n\nThis is not exactly a whitelabel solution, as the edgeryders.eu platform is used and the Edgeryders branding is applied. However, for some customers this might already be enough, as there are some limited ways of branding:\n\n* category logo and category description\n* own domain that forwards (visibly) to the customer's category page on edgeryders.eu\n\nAlso, there are advantages of this solution over one that includes a complete own Discourse site:\n\n* **Full integration with the existing Edgeryders user community.** All content of the customer's category is immediately and directly visible to our community, not \"one menu removed\" as with the federated Discourse sites. Also, in contrast to the federated Discourse sites, any member of edgeryders.eu can be @mentioned. Together, this means more interaction with that community, making it simpler to get valuable input, to publicize the site, and to show that it has an active community.\n\n* **No administration.** The client does not have to care for any administration, like adapting Discourse configuration settings, downloading backups etc.. (On the other hand, the client also cannot do this, as he or she will get only moderator permissions on edgeryders.eu but not administrator permissions. That's for technical reasons, as Discourse administrators can see all content on edgeryders.eu, which would include all our internal content.)\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-2\">2.2. Setup</h3>\n\nThis is work that will be done by an Edgeryders O\u00dc admin when launching a client's platform.\n\n_[TODO: Content of this section.]_\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-3\">2.3. Usage</h3>\n\nAll general use, both as a \"normal\" user and as a moderator / administrator, is the same as on any Discourse platform. So please refer to our [user manual](/t/id/6463) and [admin manual](/t/id/6647).\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--3\">3. Option B: Federated Discourse platform</h2>\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-1\">3.1. Description</h3>\n\nYou get a Discourse platform on a separate domain and can adapt and change (nearly) everything there. The platform is connected to edgeryders.eu and all the other Edgeryders Communities platforms through a system of shared user accounts: a user account registered on one can also log in to all the others. A menu in the top right of each page allows users to discover these platforms and to quickly switch between them. All these Discourse platforms are hosted on the Edgeryders server (though there can be exceptions).\n\nThis gives full freedom to the Edgeryders Communities platforms, as they indeed get their own Discourse installation (with full admin rights, unlimited categories etc.). Still, the sites are somewhat integrated through the cross-link menu and the shared user accounts, so in a way they all contribute to and share the benefits of one large community of users.\n\nTechnically it is possible to provide these Discourse platforms hosted by Edgeryders _without_ the integration features (\"federation\"). However, we are interested in a symbiotic platform development with respect to community and content and don't see ourselves as purely a Discourse hosting provider. For that service, we highly recommend you [book the hosting service from the makers of the Discourse forum software](https://payments.discourse.org/pricing).\n\n\n#### Features\n\n* **Own domain.** It can be registered by the client at a DNS hoster of their choice and under the name and account of the client's organization. The client keeps the full control over the domain at every time.\n\n* **Own categories.** As many as the customer likes, as it's simply an own Discourse installation.\n (Categories in our platform are equivalent to \"forums\" or \"message boards\" in other online dialogue software.)\n\n* **Online community integration.** Edgeryders has a large, international online community of changemakers and innovators and you can involve it in your Edgeryders Communities platform as follows:\n\n    The user accounts are seamlessly integrated with those of edgeryders.eu and all the other Edgeryders Communities platforms, using a system of shared accounts and automatic synchronization of e-mail address, username and realname. This allows to log in to all these platforms without having to create a new user account for each.\n\n    Note that only the identities of user accounts are synced, not the content. A user's content will only be visible on the platform where it was posted.\n\n* **Platform-switch menu.** To connect the various Edgeryders Communities platforms together, the very top right of each platform has the \"Communities\" menu. This way, visitors discover the other Edgeryders Communities platforms and can comfortably switch back and forth between them.\n\n* **Cross-site notifications. _(not yet)_** For a future extension, we plan to list the number of new notifications from Discourse for the users, behind each of the platforms listed in the top-right menu for cross-linking the Edgeryders Communities websites. The plugin providing this menu would get these notifications from the Discourse APIs of all associated sites in the network, or if necessary for speed reasons, directly out of the various databases.\n\n* **Content cross-promotion. _(not yet)_** Again for a future extension, we plan to create a Discourse plugin that cross-promotes posts between multiple  Edgeryders Communities platforms. It would be listed at the bottom of normal Discourse topic pages, comparable in function to the \"Hot Network Questions\" sidebar feature on Stack Exchange network sites like [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/).\n\n* **Open Ethnographer.** All Edgeryders Communities platforms have access to [Open Ethnographer](/t/6811), a custom tool that we added to Discourse and that allows semantic annotation of online discussions. Our existing [Open Ethnographer manual](/t/6811) applies, with the exception that admin users are different people on a Communities platform as they are chosen by the client. API access to the Open Ethnographer data is also included as documented in our [API manual](/t/7904), with the exception of access to ethical consent data as this is not part of Open Ethnographer.\n\n* **Graphryder _(not yet)_.** Graphryder is our second custom tool in our [SSNA software stack](/c/workspaces/ssna), and clients will get access to it for analyzing the online discussion incl. the annotations added to it by Open Ethnographer. This feature is available on edgeryders.eu and can be tested there on request. We need to extend Graphryder somewhat to work for multiple data sources at the same time; ETA for this feature is 2020-05. Existing clients will get access to it at no additional cost.\n\n* **Backups.** All content and configuration of the client's self-branded platform is automatically included in backups of the edgeryders.eu platform. We keep daily server snapshot backups for the last 14 days, database backups for the last four months, and additional long-term backups. (Backups and data integrity are provided on a best-effort basis. The client is expected to occasionally download the provided backups for additional data safety.)\n\n* **Archiving.** If you ever decide that you do no longer want to operate your own Discourse platform, we will take over your public content to edgeryders.eu, and keep it online there, both free of additional charges. It will still be attributed to the users who created it, and these users can still continue the discussion on edgeryders.eu as they their account also works there.\n\n* **Additional offers.** On a case-by-case basis, we can offer clients for a fee customized services related to the management, growth and analysis of online communities. For example, our two-day \"Online Community Management Masterclass\" workshop, or permanent help with online community management.\n\n\n#### Technical details\n\n* **Using Discourse as SSO provider and client.** Discourse comes with integrated functions that allow making one Discourse site the single-sign-on (SSO) \"master\" and others the SSO clients. This way, one account can log in to all federated sites. We have set up a dedicated Discourse platform just for the signup and login processes: [communities.edgeryders.eu](https://communities.edgeryders.eu/).\n\n* **Hosting as a Discourse multisite on Edgeryders' server.** In the case of Discourse, this is a way of saying \"one codebase, one server process, multiple domains, multiple databases\". All platforms are hosted on the Edgeryders server, and each gets its own database. This would be our preferred way of hosting since it hardly consumes more server resources that a single Discourse platform.\n\n    Clients have full admin user access to their Discourse platform but not to the server. So, changes to the software such as installing plugins requires intervention by Edgeryders O\u00dc admins. Installing custom plugins, incl. plugins developed by the client, is however possible that way. The plugin would be installed for all multisite platforms, but enabled only for those that want them.\n\n* **Alternatively, hosting as a standalone Discourse installation.** Complex sites that require extensive changes to the Discourse core code will not be hosted as part of the multisite setup. They would be their very own, independent Discourse installation, but still on the Edgeryders server. They can still take part in the shared account scheme with the other Edgeryders Communities platforms, as that only requires enabling the SSO (single-sign-on) functions.\n\n* **Alternatively, hosting on the clients' own server.** For really special cases where the client needs full server access, we can provide [our customized Discourse software](https://github.com/edgeryders/discourse) including the integration features of the Edgeryders Communities platforms (shared account, cross-linking) _without_ hosting on our own servers. We will also help with the setup, but software and server maintenance will be up to the client in such a case.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-2\">3.2. Setup</h3>\n\nThis is work that will be done by an Edgeryders O\u00dc admin when launching a client's platform.\n\nThis is treated in detail in its own topic: [Discourse setup with multisite and SSO](/t/id/9567).\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-3\">3.3. Usage</h3>\n\nAll general use, both as a \"normal\" user and as a moderator / administrator, is the same as on any Discourse platform. So please refer to our [user manual](/t/id/6463) and [admin manual](/t/id/6647).\n\nIf you want to adapt your platform's design, also see \"[Creating a custom Discourse theme](/t/id/7)\".\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--4\">4. Ordering and launching a platform</h2>\n\n**Audience.** Since all Edgeryders Communities are integrated, there should be a minimum of overlap of concerns and interests for them to be a cohesive, vibrant online community. This is so far defined by what the largest community of them (that of edgeryders.eu) is about: innovation, social change and activism. We are open to accommodate a wide array of projects in that area, including small or very localized projects. However, we reserve a right to turn down a client if a particular project just does not fit in \u2013 so if you are interested in this offer, please first send us a small description of your proposed online community to find out if your project is eligible.\n\n\n**Prices.** Price components are:\n\n* **Setup.** This includes the basic installation of a new Discourse platform, a certain time budget for design adaptations according to the offer, and content and user import from your previous website (if any). It does not include custom web development work, see below for that.\n\n    Price: based on an individual offer, starting from 500 EUR (excl. VAT).\n\n* **Hosting.** This includes the actual hosting with unlimited users and pageviews, up to 600 MiB of new image files per month, and backups via our regular backup system.\n\n    Price: 60 EUR per month (excl. VAT).\n\n* **Tech support and custom development _(optional)_.** We provide a free [Discourse user manual](/t/id/6463) and [Discourse admin manual](/t/id/6647), and there are a lot of other tips and tricks on [meta.discourse.org](https://meta.discourse.org/). For any questions and tasks beyond that, you can get our assistance.\n\n    Price: case based via a ticket system, at 60 EUR per hour (excl. VAT). Quick questions, price estimates and issues dealing with software malfunction caused by us are free. (Discourse bugs are _not_ caused by us :wink:)\n\n* **Community building _(optional)_.**  If you like, we can create and offer you a package that suits your needs, be it consulting on a case-by-case basis or actual hands-on services for online community building.\n\n    Price: based on an individual offer.\n\n* **Editor service _(optional)_.** We offer to upgrade user-contributed content to consistent Markdown formatting and correct spelling so that your platform leaves a good impression to potential new members and to search engines.\n\n    Price: based on an individual offer, depending on post volume. Prices are very reasonable for European standards though, as we outsource this work to our skilled partners in Nepal.\n\n**VAT.** All prices above are excl. VAT. If you are an organizational customer, typically our invoice will not include VAT and you will have to apply local VAT with the reverse charge procedure (and get it back if you are eligible for VAT pre-tax deduction). If you are an individual customer, for [some countries](https://www.vatlive.com/global-vat-gst-on-e-services/) (esp. the EU28) we have to add your local VAT to the invoice.\n\n\n**Ordering.** Please message @matthias here on the platform to let us know your requirements and to get an offer.\n\n\n**Communication.** Please _never ever e-mail us_ about your order or issue with an Edgeryders Communities platform. We hate e-mail threads because Discourse forums are so much better :wink:  Instead:\n\n* Message @matthias here on the platform about your order and requirements.\n* Post your issues to the [Software (General)](/c/workspaces/software-general) workspace category.\n* Even better, you could sign up to [Dynalist](https://dynalist.io/) and let us know your account ID. We can then have a shared dynalist for all tasks and issues of a project. If you're interested, we have a [detailed Dynalist manual](https://edgeryders.eu/t/green-book-dynalist-manual/7618). But you'll only need the basics.\n* And of course you're welcome to post in all other categories as appropriate.\n\n\n**Launch.** The Edgeryders O\u00dc tech team will work with you to get all required information, develop your platform according to your needs, and then launch it when you agree that it's ready.", "created_at": "2017-10-03 23:14:30.906336", "updated_at": "2019-09-03 18:46:45.901343", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2887, "wiki": true, "reads": 36, "score": 302.2, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 5, 4861], "is_private": false}, {"id": 83502, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 13180, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Yes.. had seen it too! \nIt was after this article that they made the changes during covid19.", "created_at": "2020-09-22 07:55:16.278628", "updated_at": "2020-09-22 07:55:16.278628", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 17, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 20.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [83414], "is_liked_by": [3206], "is_private": false}, {"id": 84724, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 14460, "post_number": 61, "raw": "[quote=\"tjdimacali, post:60, topic:14460\"]\nbut I think it\u2019s worth exploring from a non-Western perspective.\n[/quote]\n\nHell yeah.

In response to the marginalized being hit hardest by not being able to make rent, especially in the wake of the pandemic, they collected money from friends and family to book a Cape Town mansion on AirBnB, operated by the company [Turnkey365](https://turnkey365.kigobook.com/). \n\nOnce their two days were up, they simply refused to leave, demanding instead to negotiate with the owner to let them stay indefinitely. Their motivation is for this to be \"an opportunity to collectively set a precedent for cooperation between the private and civil sector to urgently redress our current social crises\".\n\nI think this post from their Facebook page outlines their motivations well. Remember that South Africa is the most unequal country in the world measured by the Gini coefficient, so this is perhaps particularly on point there.\n\n> The economy was designed to protect the wealthy, it is a pyramid scheme and it is busy dying and we are being manipulated to believe it is our duty to protect it. The economy is actually the protection of the wealth of the rich. There are 32 00 high net worth individuals in South Africa, they have at least 1 million dollars each. 50 percent of adults will be unemployed by the end of the effects of Covid-19. The high net worth individuals control 40 percent of the country's wealth. That is enough to control the country if you see it as a business. No one should have to struggle to find work or spend their entire lives working, only to struggle to make ends meet. In the midst of all this state sanctioned repression, women, children and queer people are targets of sexual, physical and verbal assault. We do not consent to this. We deserve safe, well serviced spaces. Our occupation action is an example of how we could make and claim these spaces. How we could live rather than  just  fight to survive. The time has come for us to embrace the need for change and join actions that will make the world the place we always hoped it would be\n\nI found this on re-posted by a member of the group but originally by one [Kim Lilian Windvogel](https://www.facebook.com/kim.windvogel).\n\n> The Camps Bay occupation is making people sweat because it touches on capitalism as much as it touches on mismanagement from government. If they occupied a piece of government owned land, people might be united in it because people generally hate leadership. But they're meddling somewhere else and no one knows what to do with their feelings because assimilating to Capitalism is supposed to buy you the security of ownership and decreased risk, but look now, there's a glitch in the system. 7 occupiers glitched it in a mansion in Camps Bay. 2020 is lit.\n\nObviously, they are facing a lot of backlash from all kinds of places. This is all currently unfolding. It seems to be making the media:\n\nhttps://www.iol.co.za/capetimes/news/queer-artivists-defy-requests-to-vacate-lavish-camps-bay-airbnb-residence--88cf93c0-048e-4399-b2ad-5538fc91a973\n\nAs expected, Turnkey365 has responded by now suspending pay for the staff that oversees cleaning and operating the mansion, pushing the responsibility for their precarity onto the activists. \n\nThis is a very gutsy move in many ways, as a direct action against the infestation of short-term rentals at the expense of city dwellers. They certainly have my support for trying to challenge the status quo.

I mean that while I might not use law school for it's designated purpose, I still feel I learned a lot during these years.\n\nThe biggest dissapointment was I believe the contrast between the theory and the practice of law. Because while the system of law, even though faulty in some aspects strives for finding the best solutions, the practice seemed petty and most times hypocritical and so do most of the people that I had the \"pleasure\" to meet. The values just seem to be upside down. And my ride there seemed taken out of some Kafka novel.\u00a0\n\nAbout Bologna Process..

Holochain is eventually consistent and coherent, but this is done through sharing of actors actions through using a Distributed Hash Table (or DHT) which is what bittorrent is also built around. \n\nThe chain part comes from having each actor in a distributed application store the information that the person has authored locally first in an immutable chain so that it cannot be tampered with subsequently. States of chains are shared as hashes and conflicting information on DHTs will indicate bad actors. \n\nThe Holo part comes from modelling the systems around the concept of a holographic view. Every actor has a view of the whole, the more user viewpoints that can be integrated the better the granularity and clarity of the whole. \n\nHope to see any of you in Amsterdam :) \n\n(Will be good to see you again @jeremyboom8 ;) )", "created_at": "2018-09-15 21:16:52.604381", "updated_at": "2018-09-15 21:22:18.852148", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 191, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 27.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [43861], "is_liked_by": [4631], "is_private": false}, {"id": 38655, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 7531, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2017-10-21 20:47:11.749958", "updated_at": "2017-10-21 20:47:11.749958", "deleted_at": "2017-10-22 20:51:03.122728", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22961, "user_id": 97, "topic_id": 4480, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Difficult</b>\n\nI'd agree this is a bit of a thorny issue.\u00a0\n\nI used to engage with a geographically diverse group who were exploring pushing FLOSS stuff ( Stallman style ) into areas outside software.\u00a0 They had (before I ran into them) some audio meetings and recorded them and archived on their wiki, although this had stopped.\u00a0 They also logged and publicly archived their main IRC channel (the main communication channel)\n\nAfter the Snowden revelations they stopped the IRC logging and removed all accessibility to the archive.\u00a0 Which is interesting considering that the Snowden revelations were about covert capture of private communications and the IRC logs were public.\u00a0 I guess it made everyone think a bit more about their data and what it might be used for, but then its also somewhat stifling to effective open collaboration.\n\nIts a cost benefit thing.\u00a0\n\nThe cost can be made explicit.\u00a0 If everyone is made aware that things will be recorded in all communications about the meeting then they can talk, or not, with that awareness.\u00a0 Similar to whether they choose to attend/participate in a real life meeting which is open to any attendees and may be being photographed or videoed.\u00a0 I know sometimes, but this appears to be the exception, people are asked to tell the photographers / videoers if they dont want to be recorded - I went to a 50 person soil science seminar recently where this was the case.\n\nBut then how many people want to actually listen to the recordings?\u00a0\u00a0 I do a lot of manual work and often listen to podcasts while I work - I could see myself also listening to meeting recordings.\n\nThere are many potential benefits to open working.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-01 11:40:03", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:07.520254", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 308, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [22605], "is_liked_by": [2551], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22478, "user_id": 2095, "topic_id": 3045, "post_number": 11, "raw": "<b>Thank you</b>\n\nDear Tamara,\n\nThank you for your prompt reply.\u00a0\n\n<span>The rate of illiteracy in <span>Egypt </span>is likely to be 50% of the population, two third of which are women.

We're looking for ethnographers to join us for the Babel Between Us project -- please see the call below and disseminate to anyone you think might be interested and well-suited for the role :) \n\nhttps://bbu.world/t/now-hiring-ethnographers-for-collaborative-fiction-project\n\n**Who**\n\nWe are Hugi Asge\u00edrsson, Ola Claesson and Jakob Skote, a programmer, a writer and an artist all deeply involved in the Scandinavian scene of participatory art and culture, and Amelia Hassoun, a UK-based cultural anthropologist and geographer. In our work we explore new ways of collaborating and creating through the use of new technology and novel social practices.\n\nWe have gotten a grant from the Swedish Arts Council to explore how digital ethnography can enhance collaborative creative processes online. We are currently building a team for this project, and that is where you come in.\n\n**The Project**\n\nBabel Between Us is a cartographic visualization of a collaboratively created fiction. A group of around 20 writers collectively improvise a story on an online forum over approximately 6 months. As they follow this collaborative writing exercise from beginning to end, a team of ethnographers (including you!) code and analyse the story on the platform, and those codes are automatically visualised as an interactive network map. We use the codes to build an interactive network of collective associations, mixing ethnography and network science to produce a visualisation of the story. This map is then presented back to the group of writers throughout the process. The final map is also presented as an interactive artwork in itself which the general public can explore.\n\n**You**\n\nWe are looking to hire two ethnographers to collaborate with us on this project. This would run for about six months on a part-time basis (about 20% of your time). The position pays 28,000 SEK total.\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n* Trained in the theory and practice of ethnography.\n* Comfortable performing online ethnography.\n* Experience with qualitative data analysis, specifically qualitative coding. The software is unimportant as we have our own, which you will be trained to use.\n* An open mind and a creative spirit \u2013 this is a highly experimental project and a non-traditional ethnographic environment. It will be a learning process for all involved and you will be co-creating a new artistic practice as well as performing analysis on that practice.\n* Ability to collaborate with other ethnographers.\n* Flexibility and willingness to engage in productive dialogue around coding decisions\u2014 good communication skills are a must.\n* Strong organization skills \u2013 must be available for weekly check-ins and document coding choices in a shared open codebook.\n\n**Tasks**\n\n* Code the story as it unfolds, using a tool we built in-house called Open Ethnographer.\n* Build an ontology of relevant codes, appropriate to ethnographic coding of the story, and keep a detailed and organized codebook.\n* Collaborate with other ethnographers to maintain a consistent coding ontology.\n* Help to compile an ethnographic report (or other kind of medium to present your reflections) at the conclusion of the project.\n* Participate in the discussion towards improving both Open Ethnographer and the SSNA methodology.\n* Discuss the artistic and explorative evolution of the project and help design future iterations\n\nThe work will take place from January 2020 to June 2020.\n\n**Where will the work happen?**\n\nThe majority of the work will be done remotely. You can do the work online, from wherever you are.\n\nThe exception will be an ethnographic methods training in January, for which the project will pay for travel and accommodation.\n\nIf you happen to be in Brussels or Stockholm, you can also come work at the Reef or Blivande (our workspaces), but that\u2019s not a requisite. We coordinate and communicate through the Edgeryders platform.\n\n*If you are interested and believe you fit the criteria, please email [amelia@edgeryders.eu](http://amelia@edgeryders.eu/) with a CV and a letter describing yourself and telling us why you want to work on the project.*\n\nPlease feel free to comment below with any questions!\n\nIf you feel that this project is interesting but that you\u2019d rather be one of the writers, please let us know and we will send you the application when it\u2019s out.\n\nHere follows our original application for the project which describes it in more depth:\n\nBabel Between Us is a cartographic visualization of a collaboratively created fiction. A group of around 20 writers collectively improvise a story on an online forum during an extensive amount of time. The resulting fiction is analyzed by a team of ethnographers and presented as an interactive web-based map. This map is then presented back to the group throughout the process. The final map is also presented as an interactive artwork in itself which the general public can explore.\n\n**Theoretical Exploration**\n\nWe want to explore new ways to create and present collaboratively written literature. The best way to present a collective creative process is not necessarily in traditional form, but the nature of the process itself may require entirely new media formats to make the content comprehensible.\n\nBy presenting a co-created story as a map, we allow the spectators to explore the world the writers have collectively created. Because they themselves interact with the fiction and find their own ways through the maze, we break up the linear narrative we are otherwise accustomed to. Since the map of the connection between the various posts is the basis of the experience of the work, the written text becomes secondary to the actual story.\n\n**Collaborative Process**\n\nWe let twenty invited co-writers write a co-created fiction for three, month-long cycles. Writing takes place on an online forum where each new posts and comment is considered a unique item. Each such post has a unique timestamp and sender.\n\nThe writers have no other rules except to follow the principle of \u201cyes, and.\u201d This means that we ask the writers to build on each other\u2019s ideas and not prevent or shoot down each other\u2019s creative processes.\n\n**Digital Ethnography &amp; SSNA**\n\nTo create the map, we use the latest technology in digital ethnography, called semantic social network analysis (SSNA). The process briefly states that a group of ethnographers analyze all the entries that the writers write on the forum, and gives each record one or more tags that can process all the content, from events to mood, tone, and more. Read more on SSNA in this paper.\n\nThese items and tags are visualized in an interactive network graph, which is the basis for the cartographic visualisation.\n\n**Why?**\n\nCollective writing easily becomes unmanageably sprawling because it is difficult for any single participant to embrace the totality of the fiction they co-create. Unlike improvisation theater, live role-playing and other co-created art forms, collective writing takes place as correspondence where many threads are going on at the same time, while the writers are in very different environments and state of mind.\n\nThe role of the ethnographers is then to show the writers an overview of their collectively created fiction. The interactive network graph allows them to see which themes they themselves have been most involved in and which they have not yet explored, and which writers they often interact with and which they not. They also see which themes often occur together and can explore the history they themselves write from angles they have not seen before, allowing them to consciously allow them to converge or branch.\n\nThe writing takes place in three cycles each lasting one month. During the first cycle the writers write without seeing any ethnography. After the first cycle, the ethnographers complete the interactive map, which is then presented to the writers. Then the second cycle begins when the writers continue to write, but now with the map as a reference. After the second cycle, the second round of ethnography is concluded, and the writers then see the new map before they enter the last cycle. Then a final round of ethnography is made to produce the final map.\n\n**The Map**\n\nWe intend to exhibit the final map, both as an interactive web-based map free for internet to explore, as well as a physical piece in an exhibition space. Both of these will be designed in the end of the project, when we have a better overview over the data.\n\nFor the audience, exploring the map becomes a boundless discovery of a world, where you yourself put together how everything is connected. The map becomes a book without beginning nor end.\n\nFor those who want to dive into the methods used all source material will be available, including interactive tools for exploring the graphs in the SSNA software used by the ethnographers. The project will also result in a research report describing how we have developed the technology behind SSNA and its application.\n\n**Collaboration with academia**\n\nThis project is a collaboration with the Edgeryders Research Network, experts at the forefront of using digital ethnography to understand the depths of online conversations. Through having ethnographers and network scientists from Edgeryders on the team, we have access to the software, methods, and expertise that make SSNA possible to implement.\n\n**Final thoughts**\n\nThe project creates a new artistic practice where collaborative processes and new technology reinforce each other. The basis of this practice is the self-reinforcing feedback loop that arises in the interaction between the writers and the ethnographers. In this way, we explore the possibilities for how literature and ethnography can interact in new forms of expression, while at the same time testing the boundaries of both areas.", "created_at": "2019-09-18 12:30:43.691362", "updated_at": "2019-09-18 17:53:13.968596", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1594, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 1651.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4022], "is_private": false}, {"id": 37682, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 7263, "post_number": 18, "raw": "http://openvillage.edgeryders.eu/fellowship/", "created_at": "2017-10-06 08:16:26.906910", "updated_at": "2017-10-06 08:16:26.906910", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 5, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 23.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [37650], "is_liked_by": [4056], "is_private": false}, {"id": 76824, "user_id": 6417, "topic_id": 13554, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Climate-KIC?

Yes, many people into NVC seem also to value his perspective, particularly those who are interested in bringing NVC-type techniques into the workplace. My partner is looking at this area, and is also impressed by Miki Kashtan -- not read by me yet though! She is pursuing certified NVC practitioner status, and is now well connected with the NVC scene in the UK. She is one of the ones who did the RC training and helps host Circles here.\n\nYour work with organisations looks really interesting, and I'd like to learn more. Yes, there is plenty of overlap with the collective or organisational mental health of any group of people in regular interaction. The quality of that interaction is highly significant. And there are skills there to be learned and practiced -- that's part of my understanding of the basic approach of NVC.\n\nMaybe there are several potential sources of cognitive (or affective?) dissonance, in 1-1 relationships as well as in groups, and again it could be seen as a branch of communication skills to address that dissonance and foster harmony (one of my favourite words ;) ). What I don't know enough about is how to help people (including myself) see the distorted views of themselves which contribute to dissonances in others as well as themselves. 1-1 interactions can so easily stall. Anyway I see these issues as highly relevant to the range of wellbeing and care issues that we are all investigating and may be living through as well.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-06-28 14:30:22", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:36.872667", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 271, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 1.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [27828], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 37662, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 6455, "post_number": 12, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2017-10-05 22:04:17.394776", "updated_at": "2017-10-05 22:04:17.394776", "deleted_at": "2017-10-28 00:08:49.819968", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 36097, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 7052, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2017-09-12 18:27:48.460401", "updated_at": "2017-11-14 19:10:30.171918", "deleted_at": "2018-05-23 11:42:59.825191", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 37661, "user_id": 4003, "topic_id": 7350, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Being a persistent person, I always aspire to do the best and achieve what I dream of.\n\nI was one of the three winners of the competition \"The Other has the Right to\u2026.\" Organized by the initiative, Monazrah in Beirut.", "created_at": "2017-10-05 22:03:29.671960", "updated_at": "2017-10-05 22:39:53.414136", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 40, "wiki": false, "reads": 21, "score": 94.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1935], "is_private": false}, {"id": 37667, "user_id": 3703, "topic_id": 7170, "post_number": 37, "raw": "Hello may I join the social Media team ? @Heba @owen", "created_at": "2017-10-05 22:44:32.117305", "updated_at": "2017-10-05 22:44:32.117305", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 10, "wiki": false, "reads": 30, "score": 16.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 37673, "user_id": 3769, "topic_id": 7259, "post_number": 7, "raw": "Of course \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83c\udf40", "created_at": "2017-10-06 04:53:08.854934", "updated_at": "2017-10-06 04:53:08.854934", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 2.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [37653], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 56141, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 10105, "post_number": 5, "raw": "[quote=\"jasen_lakic, post:4, topic:10105\"]\nSamo bi bilo lijepo kad bi ljudi uz tu slobodnu volju prihvatili i apsolutnu odgovornost za svoja djela, rjeci, namjere itd.

I'm working on creating and then analysing surveys (about stress and well being at work) and when designing it, we have to take into account the bias induced by the question formulation for instance, or the periodicity of the campaign, and there are some methodologies to reduce such error inherent in the survey measurements. But it seems that being a part of the observation should reduce this bias and should allow for more precise analysis, because for example you discover the ideas / concepts covered almost on the fly and intuitively it would converge more naturally to something. (And it is more interesting to participate the subject you are studying, it should be more immersive). I would be very happy to learn more about this field :)\n\nThat being said, to join another topic of this discussion, when dealing with open ended questions, we have to find topics and there is also the issue of scaling when we have many answers. We tried to do it automatically via nlp technics (as a first step, before manually sharpening between topics) and with 4000 answers, and given the noise induced by open ended question (it is as if you give a blank page and ask someone to tell you how does he feel today, for example, and when asked, you are left to the participant's imagination, without the ability to readjust anything), we can have some results, and some visualisation of the topics as well (we are using NMF, for those who are familiar with ML, with a lot of cleanup beforehand).\nSo maybe it is usable in ethnography, as a first step to define code (the big ones).", "created_at": "2018-09-12 10:59:55.728241", "updated_at": "2018-09-12 10:59:55.728241", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 377, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 51.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3323], "is_private": false}, {"id": 37670, "user_id": 4095, "topic_id": 7127, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Dear Noemi!\n\nThank you so much for writing up this amazing article!

It was a real pleasure to host you!\n\nTo speak for myself, I was overwhelmed by the high density of awe-inspiring, like-minded and congenial people on site.

I have a solid background in natural building, especially in building Earthships and could give an input on Earthship technology, the global movement and about social dynamics/personal growth potential in practical building workshops. I also could give an input on the Wir bauen Zukunft project, our approach to develop a project community and what we've learned so far.

The sum of my career has revolved around creating new approaches to problems, both in research and practice, and in contexts commercial, academic, and creative. \n\nWhere my interests originates? That's not something that can be answered in a sentence. But, in the context of this event, a large swathe of my research and practice activities involve developing new applications for scientific and technological tools. Some of this work is purely conceptual. Other works involve guiding the likes of software and other commercial companies to new and emerging markets. Though I already know this terrain very well, it's always useful to get a good idea where new talent and opportunities are opening, be it that projects and companies I'm involved with have relevance, or simply in my capacity as a mentor and advisor to up and coming talent in fields including speculative fiction, design, and futures more generally.  <br /><br />", "created_at": "2020-10-01 14:19:53.781598", "updated_at": "2020-10-01 14:19:53.781598", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 215, "wiki": false, "reads": 30, "score": 66.0, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 2915, 6670], "is_private": false}, {"id": 78461, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 13819, "post_number": 7, "raw": "@marina I meant to ask you to seek feedback from people in the research space.

As covid isn't that much more dangerous than flu and is certainly much less dangerous than some other viruses which can hit your grandma.

You try wearing the mask and just breathing faster in it for a minute and tell me what you feel. What are the effects on people wearing those for so long? \nLet's not get into the fact a  lot of people die indirectly due to corona measures or corona scare. Like, avoiding hospitals and not getting treatment on time. Like deaths at emergencies because the stuff is forbidden to do mouth to mouth during reanimation (increase by 30%).

Look at the reduction of the number of cancer detected cases year on year in UK. How many people will die because they now have cancer which was never detected and in a year it will be too late? Cancer mortality rate is more like 50%, so what about that?\nHow many people will die of famine due to this measures? How many millions was the number given by UN? What of economic situation?

If you have any advice for an effective interview, please add to the bullet points below. The interview questions to be featured for each webinar are drawn from the event program (under construction [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/summit-program/13402)).*\n\n# Webinar Format and preparation process\n* Each webinar features an existing initiative or experience. Each consists of a 10 minutes pre-recorded video interview (also used to promote the webinar) + a deep Q&A with the protagonists of the experience being featured. Videos to be produced by @estragon with input from a copywriter (and in practice some low level editing).\n* This work culminates in a larger event, a summit, to be held online one month after the completed production of the webinar and promo videos. (subject to the lifting of travel restrictions). \n* What kind of content/ audience is this directed towards: To get a sense of the quality and audience, have a look at [this session we did on a different topic](https://edgeryders.eu/t/workshop-on-inequalities-in-the-age-of-ai-what-they-are-how-they-work-and-what-we-can-do-about-them-19-11-brussels/10326).\n\n# How to produce the webinar\n*Instructions adapted from the template produced by Ben Vickers in connection with Lote3*\n\n## 1. Do an Interview over video chat\n\n* upt to Max 60 minute minute audio recordings plus interview transcript\n* In each, asking the same set of questions.\n* Each audio should also contain an additional 5-10 minutes free form conversation led by the interviewee.\n* Make sure that you record the whole conversation with excellent audio and save in a standard format audio file. \n* ***Make sure that you have secured a signature on our digital consent form from the interviewee** **before you leave the conversation*** (ask @kajafarszky to help you set up a digital consent form). \n\n## 2. Guide to achieving a good interview\n\nIn order to achieve the best outcome from an interviewee it\u2019s important to familiarise yourself with the work of the person you\u2019re interviewing before hand, at very least read the about section on their website.\n\n1. Make sure you have the technical set up for good audio and video. Talk to @estragon for help with this.\n2. Spend 5-15 minutes at least talking with the person you\u2019re going to interview before the interview starts, so you\u2019re comfortable with one another and they can respond in a relaxed way on camera.\n2. It is essential to have a clean recording of the voice with minimum background noise. (Always use a good microphone, even if just earbuds.  Never use the laptop mic.  Use a quiet room with no other talking and no street noise.  Be mindful that you are recording - avoid coughs, throat clearing, saying \"um\" and \"you know\" too often.  If you have time, do a quick dry run to ensure that all parties are properly set up.)\n3. Make sure they\u2019re aware that the audio and transcript is going to be put online and shared within the Edgeryders network and further afield, so that they know the scope of their audience in advance, (fairly specialised but with the desire to share further).\n4. Give them a sense of the questions you\u2019re going to be asking before hand so they can think ahead - but also familiarise them with the intended output of the video so they can be conscious of it when responding to the questions (this will make editing easier later). Explain that specifically for these videos we intend to chop up some of the footage as well as producing a standalone video of them - we plan to create a combination video of individuals responding to the question at the centre of the summit theme.\n5. Upon asking the initial question \u201cTell me about your project and work\u201d, if they stop short use the other questions \u201cHow did you get started\u201d, \u201cWhat are the core objectives\u201d to bulk out the response, hopefully though individuals will understand the need to give a good 2-3 minute overview of their work.\n6. Allow 5 second breaks between questions, continued conversation makes it difficult to edit later.\n7. Try to phrase your questions in a way that the interviewee needs to include the context in their response, which will make it much more useful when editing. i.e. the question \u201cWhy did you choose radioactive monkeys as a subject for your experiments?\u201d might elicit the response \u201cbecause I like the way they glow\u201d which is not a very informative sentence without the context of the question. However, this question is better: \u201cI\u2019d like to know what led to you working with radioactive monkeys - can you tell me about some of the reasons behind this decision?\u201d Here the interviewee cannot begin their sentence with a \u2018because\u2019 and they\u2019re less likely to use a pronoun to talk about the monkeys, because I mentioned them too far back in my question.\n\n## 3. Interview questions\n\nThe standard questions:\n\n* Tell me about your project/work?\n* How you got started.\n* Who\u2019s involved.\n* What your main objectives are.\n* What does the concept of (\u2026Add topic relevant to their work/the event here) mean to you?\n* What do you believe are the most important projects internationally that related to ( topic relevant to their work and the context/event ) a in this moment?\n\nPotential additional questions:\n\n* What question did I not ask that you think is important and you\u2019d like to respond to?\n* What does (key big theme we are exploring) mean in this moment?\n* What are the fundamental lessons from the past that we can learn from now?\n* What is an example of a heroic act in this moment?\n\n## 4. How to deliver the webinar content\n* Send the audio file to an online transcription service\n* Send the  video recording + audio file + transcript file to nadia@edgeryders.eu and estragon@gmail.com \n\n\n# How to approach people you want to interview\n### Email template text for explaining the process and why it makes sense to do this:\n\nSubject: Following up on our exchange on (twitter, linked in , fb etc) re: interviewing you about (their topic/topic of session)\n\nDo you have time at some point between now and .... for a remote interview, followed by a q&A in the form of responding to a few questions in comments from other participants ahead of the workshop in a moderated thread on our online forum? Realistically it would be something like 2.5 hrs in total.\n\nWhat we/I do is finding find people who are doing work we believe is important and have aligned values and complimentary goals. Cut down the investment of time and effort for them to discover and understand one another\u2019s work. To make it easy we do an in depth interview that is more in conversation form. Then transcribe and do a first edit into a skeleton post for the interviewee to edit till they are happy, and when they are ready they post it under their own name.\n\nThen our community managers draw the attention of others who have complimentary interests, needs, skills and or access to people who might: and the other way around. People read one another and post questions and answers through comments.

Upon announcing the event, attendants will be invited to ask specific questions in advance, online, over the social networks, so that the lecturer will be ready to answer them thoroughly and correctly, which will make the education and science more \u201cdown to earth\u201d, practical and closer to the community. This will increase the overall effect of raising the awareness of the community, and will also provide certain insight about the interest in, as well as the current state of that type of knowledge that is present within that community. The community of Kru\u0161evac neglects theese topics, and that is not the way we need to relate to them, as we are not the only ones to suffer the consequences of our ignorance. We believe that we can inspire interest and interaction within the community, as well as bring a whole new chapter and type of activities that we carry out in our cultural center.

Conversations about replicating the unMonastery started before the first prototype came to life, so the unMonastery in a Box.\n\nWe should expect that more would be asking how to start the unMonastery. What is needed apart from a toolbox to build it from? Any requirements?\n\nSome want unMonastery because they know of a particular building which is beautiful, others will start from the operational capacity, interest and support from local authorities, institutions, interest and willingness to participate from people living in the area, basic infrastructure or a capacity to build and maintain one.\n\nThe concept of the unMonastery is beautiful and inspiring, it does make people dream. Good to keep levels of motivation high. It is important though to be aware of the workload and dangers, so the initiative doesn\u2019t falls into the same trap most of the intentional communities do.\n\nPrototyping is a good means of dream induced disasters, as well as of building a fail-fast unMonastery in a Box.\n\n\u201d\u2026through consistent prototyping it iterates rather than copies, and with each repetition it is intended that the model improve and develop in response to a place\u2019s conditions.\u201d\n\n<a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/unmonastery-bergamo#comment-form\">In a Recent post</a> by @Bergamo-Hub @Ben mentioned that the unMonastery in a Box is not ready yet\n\nHowever, the conversation with those willing to give unMon 2.0 a go is crucial to the unMon in a Box. It not only relates to unMonastery, but it can also shed some light of how to go about other ER projects local iterations, prototypes and remixes. It is important to start these conversations early. Discuss rules for iterations, so the project preserves it\u2019s opensourceness, but immune from cascading failure, dilution of ideas and a general loss of oomph.\n\nLess dreamy they are the better: let's not limit the conversation to renovation of beautiful buildings on the hillside. Though, beautiful buildings I like.\n\nDreams aside, people with a good understanding of their local infrastructure and experience with residency projects, discussing concrete proposals would definitely be valuable contributors to the unMon in a Box.\n\nQuestions which I would like to bring out from previous conversations, while the unBox is on it\u2019s way.\n\n- What a standard procedure of handing over The Box with the unMonastery inside can be?\n\n- What are the rules of replication, and what are the rules for changing rules?\n\n- Which processes can be established to allow test mode unMon\n\nWe can have a look at existing models.\n\nDuring LOTE3 we had Replicating The unMonastery Session very nicely facilitated by @vvorski. Overall the session was about developing and implementing standard processes. Tools and rituals to run once established unMon were documented. Though, I couldn't find documentation of one of the very important parts of the conversation which happened during the session.\n\nPlease, ping me if you came across any bits of information around this topic.\n\n@<a href=\"/u/elf_pavlik\">ElfPavlik</a> you're suggesting groups for each provisional/possible iteration? I like the idea of having Edgeryders groups for it: it is simple. Though one aggregating thread for discussing iterations is important, so it doesn't get spread across the platform, so one can't see another. A new group, or an appropriate existing one? Keep it in this thread?\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-24 20:00:01", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:34.603984", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 610, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 75924, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 13309, "post_number": 50, "raw": "@mattias, thank you for your question and for sharing the invitation.\n\nAt the moment we can only do it with the rsvp signup.

A few years back I was running <a href=\"http://progettokublai.ning.com\">a project</a> for the Italian Ministry of Economic Development that used Ning to host its community (it still does).

One of the things on my current to-do list (on which I am later than I'd hoped to be) is to create a first Ci2i newsletter for practitioners who have registered with us. As I set out to do that, I find myself mentally not just writing one but a series of themed mailings that offer a variety of content - blog posts, discussion highlights and invitations, resources, co-creative impact-related initatives, tools, courses etc.\u00a0\n\nInspired by your comments, Tom and John, It's occurred to me that what I'd really love to do is pull just the first 1-2 issues together and then invite a new co-creative impact practitioner to create it each month, along whatever related theme they want, and drawing in whatever readings they might pull together from all of us. Along the way we can also add all of those links to the Ci2i site wherever they might best belong, so it can become a useful learning repository.\u00a0\n\nI'm imagining a wikispace in this group would be useful for planning and sharing/organizing content we've already got at our fingertips, to contribute to potential themes. [jsbaxter], I've already been planning to include a link to your recent post here in the Ci2i group space in the first issue.\n\nIf you (and any others!) already have or know about content that will be sharable 4 weeks from now around <strong>co-creative leadership</strong> (the theme I'd like to build next month's issue around) could you start a \"co-creative magazine\" wikispace here and start dropping the links/descriptions in (and anything else you feel would be useful at this point). I've little time left to play here today, but if can you start it, I will happily join you there in thinking further through how we can organize plan and format content we've already collectively got.\u00a0\n\n\\#gratitude.

Since this kind of relationship is generally pretty opaque on any online social platform, it would be great to hear about it.\u00a0\n\nWhat motivates you to invite someone to join EdgeRyders? What sort of person do you think benefits from and can contribute to EdgeRyders in your offline network? and when they do join do you communicate with them more than others?\n\nUltimately in this context, I'd like to understand how this effects the formation of \u00a0the sub-communities.\u00a0\n\nFrom my experience, I invited my friend Felix Waterhouse to join EdgeRyders because I felt the work he was doing is an important part of this conversation but also because he perhaps represents someone that is adverse to taking his discussion online - social networks, twitter etc are not things that for him function in his daily activity.\n\nMy feeling and experience of many individuals who 'ride the edge' is that this is common - those i'm closest to that are most active in trying to instigate (and force) change, don't use facebook, they don't use twitter and trying to convince them to contribute to an online platform is a pretty difficult feat.\u00a0\n\nDo you think this is true for online discussion generally, that there is always an inherent network bias towards those that favour a particular kind of interaction? It seems apparent in this thread that such suggestions are already being made in relation to gender.\u00a0\n\nTo get the ball rolling;\u00a0\n\nHow many people do you know on EdgeRyders IRL Alberto?

So far so good. Many people, wanting to participate, have been asking us: <em>how</em> is that just going to work? What do you actually do on Edgeryders?\n\nThe answer is simple: you research issues and provide your insight. It should not be hard: we are talking about issues you know very well, because you deal with them every day. Tasks are designed so that they only take a limited time and effort, but their results are still meaningful just because of the deep-ingrained expertise underlying it.\n\nTo learn more about what kinds of questions we will be asking ourselves, look <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/campaigns-missions/\">here</a>. At the same time, you play. There is a trace of gaming in Edgeryders: completing missions means earning points, going up levels, joining one of the Houses of the Edge, and many more things besides. We will be blogging about the gaming elements soon. Stay tuned!\n\nBelow is a very simple illustration of the output we want to produce; an exercise of building a shared vision of transition, by pooling together pieces of research and trying to make sense of it all.

The energy was high with lots of questions asked that we can further clarify below.\n\n**What\u2019s the purpose of the residency?**\n\nScience Fiction writing has produced some excellent worlds over the years. In fact, we think it\u2019s doing a better job at imagining different futures and economies than the real world is. Because of this the Fondazione di Comunit\u00e0 Messina and Sci-Fi Economics Lab are organising for one author to travel to Messina in Italy to spend some time sketching out a new world.\n\nMessina itself is an inspiring place - it has built its own [economic model](https://edgeryders.eu/t/what-we-can-learn-from-messina-s-economic-model/14424/11) through the work of the Fondazione - and is an ideal location to create the outline for a future blueprint.\n\n**How are we doing it?**\n\nThe project is open ended but we will be placing a particular emphasis on building new economies - lots of economies.\n\nThis is a collaborative project, where the chosen writer will sketch out his or her own world and bring the work to the Edgeryders\u2019 platform. Here, our experts - we have over 100 economic experts, anthropologists and scientists with a lot of knowledge to share - will build on some of the elements put forward by the writer. Ideas will be tested through a critical lens to see if they are tangible.\n\nWe want to see a world and economies that could be fully visualised and exist in the near future.\n\n**What do we want to achieve?**\n\nWe see lots of potential with this project, and judging by the level of interest so do many others. We want to build a bible or canon which will be open-source and allows other authors, writers and worldbuilders to create stories based in this reality.\n\nThe canon will be the intellectual property of the author(s) but will have a [Creative Commons \u2013 Attribution license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\n\n**How will covid impact the residency?**\n\nWith country restrictions constantly changing due to Covid we aren\u2019t entirely sure how it will impact this project. We are currently processing applications and we will select an author to travel to Messina, but we understand circumstances may change.\n\nWe are open to work with the chosen author and come to an arrangement that suits both parties. For instance, if restrictions only allow for a virtual residency to take place in 2020, we will do that and arrange that the author gets to visit Messina in 2021.\n\n**How to apply?**\n\nIf you would like to apply for the residency please write a short letter of intent to [andreja@edgeryders.eu](mailto:andreja@edgeryders.eu). Explain how you propose to build this world, add a CV or link to your personal website and anything else you think allows us to learn more about you.\n\nThe writer will likely be chosen by October 23rd, but if you happen to see this post after that deadline, please still send us your details; we may still be working on the project - or something similar - and need your help.\n\n**Who should apply?**\n\nWe welcome applications from all types of people as long as they care about creating economic systems that work for all. It will help if you are a speculative fiction author, economist, anthropologist, social scientist, but it\u2019s not necessary.\n\n**I want to join the project but I have other commitments and won\u2019t be able to take 15 days to write this, what should I do?**\n\nNot to worry, you can still join in the discussion on Edgeryders\u2019 platform. We would love to have your input on this collaborative project. You can comment on [this post](https://edgeryders.eu/t/come-meet-everyone-on-october-16-info-session-about-our-new-worldbuilding-academy/14460) with your interest and we will keep you updated on the project.\n\nThe writer's residency is just the start of this project, we will have other ways in which you can engage with this project in 2021.\n\n[More information on the residency is available here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/writers-residency-come-lead-the-worldbuilding-academy/14502)", "created_at": "2020-10-16 14:23:09.106431", "updated_at": "2020-10-16 14:30:29.706481", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 742, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 47.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [6670, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 37728, "user_id": 4056, "topic_id": 6662, "post_number": 16, "raw": "[text-direction=rtl]\n\n\u0634\u064a\u0621 \u062c\u0645\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0645\u0639\u0643\u0645  \u0641\u064a \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u062a\u0645\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0641\u062a\u0648\u062d ..\n[/text-direction]", "created_at": "2017-10-06 13:30:08.012736", "updated_at": "2017-10-06 14:59:36.480135", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 14, "wiki": false, "reads": 23, "score": 559.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 85216, "user_id": 6670, "topic_id": 14611, "post_number": 3, "raw": "I think you have covered it all", "created_at": "2020-10-16 14:32:19.027724", "updated_at": "2020-10-16 14:32:19.027724", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 7, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 16.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [85215], "is_liked_by": [6455], "is_private": false}, {"id": 85215, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 14611, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2020-10-16 14:27:20.910088", "updated_at": "2020-10-16 14:33:52.459658", "deleted_at": "2020-10-23 06:50:04.442774", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 59430, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 10217, "post_number": 118, "raw": "This will be optional and its for the research we are doing - what do you suggest dropping?", "created_at": "2019-09-17 08:14:27.830836", "updated_at": "2019-09-17 08:14:27.830836", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 17, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 12.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 55661, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 10217, "post_number": 7, "raw": "Says the cross-fit beast.

Capitalists won't care for ethical or unethical foods but about demand \u2026 including demand for ethical foods. No amount of certification can force big business permanently into producing ethical food (see \"greenwashing\", \"fairwashing\" etc.). But buying from small businesses, coops and local businesses as much as possible will already help a good deal \u2026\n\n* **Consumption and shopping.** You write:\n\n    > The way we consume shapes the way we shop. If we consume mindlessly, we shop mindlessly.\n\n    The reverse is also true: the way we shop shapes the way we consume. Because (for the example of food), we can only eat what we purchased and brought to the house. I use this as my major tool of healthy eating: being mindful during one hour of shopping allows to not think much while cooking and eating. I basically create a [behavior setting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_settings) for myself.\n\n* **Making it practical.** Once your readers understood that shopping is about moral decisions, it would be great if you'd offer them practical steps and tools for that.

The energy was high with lots of questions asked that we can further clarify below.\n\n**What\u2019s the purpose of the residency?**\n\nScience Fiction writing has produced some excellent worlds over the years. In fact, we think it\u2019s doing a better job at imagining different futures and economies than the real world is. Because of this the Fondazione di Comunit\u00e0 Messina and Sci-Fi Economics Lab are organising for one author to travel to Messina in Italy to spend some time sketching out a new world.\n\nMessina itself is an inspiring place - it has built its own [economic model](https://edgeryders.eu/t/what-we-can-learn-from-messina-s-economic-model/14424/11) through the work of the Fondazione - and is an ideal location to create the outline for a future blueprint.\n\n**How are we doing it?**\n\nThe project is open ended but we will be placing a particular emphasis on building new economies - lots of economies.\n\nThis is a collaborative project, where the chosen writer will sketch out his or her own world and bring the work to the Edgeryders\u2019 platform. Here, our experts - we have over 100 economic experts, anthropologists and scientists with a lot of knowledge to share - will build on some of the elements put forward by the writer. Ideas will be tested through a critical lens to see if they are tangible.\n\nWe want to see a world and economies that could be fully visualised and exist in the near future.\n\n**What do we want to achieve?**\n\nWe see lots of potential with this project, and judging by the level of interest so do many others. We want to build a bible or canon which will be open-source and allows other authors, writers and worldbuilders to create stories based in this reality.\n\nThe canon will be the intellectual property of the author(s) but will have a [Creative Commons \u2013 Attribution license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\n\n**How will covid impact the residency?**\n\nWith country restrictions constantly changing due to Covid we aren\u2019t entirely sure how it will impact this project. We are currently processing applications and we will select an author to travel to Messina, but we understand circumstances may change.\n\nWe are open to work with the chosen author and come to an arrangement that suits both parties. For instance, if restrictions only allow for a virtual residency to take place in 2020, we will do that and arrange that the author gets to visit Messina in 2021.\n\n**How to apply?**\n\nIf you would like to apply for the residency please write a short letter of intent to [andreja@edgeryders.eu](mailto:andreja@edgeryders.eu). Explain how you propose to build this world, add a CV or link to your personal website and anything else you think allows us to learn more about you.\n\nThe writer will likely be chosen by October 23rd, but if you happen to see this post after that deadline, please still send us your details; we may still be working on the project - or something similar - and need your help.\n\n**Who should apply?**\n\nWe welcome applications from all types of people as long as they care about creating economic systems that work for all. It will help if you are a speculative fiction author, economist, anthropologist, social scientist, but it\u2019s not necessary.\n\n**I want to join the project but I have other commitments and won\u2019t be able to take 15 days to write this, what should I do?**\n\nNot to worry, you can still join in the discussion on Edgeryders\u2019 platform.

You can comment on [this post](https://edgeryders.eu/t/come-meet-everyone-on-october-16-info-session-about-our-new-worldbuilding-academy/14460) with your interest and we will keep you updated on the project.\n\nThe writer's residency is just the start of this project, we will have other ways in which you can engage with this project in 2021.\n\n[More information on the residency is available here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/writers-residency-come-lead-the-worldbuilding-academy/14502)", "created_at": "2020-10-16 14:36:42.708193", "updated_at": "2020-10-16 14:36:42.708193", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 742, "wiki": false, "reads": 23, "score": 99.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 53213, "user_id": 3206, "topic_id": 9856, "post_number": 5, "raw": "How come you don't address the impact on health?

To my mind a great example is the burning man festival in the US which is organised around <a href=\"http://www.burningman.com/whatisburningman/about_burningman/principles.html\">10 principles. </a>From this the festival has grown to become a huge event but no one is in charge.\n\nIf we recognise that individuals are capable of responsible, autonomous behaviour, without external control, it suggests:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>shared purpose and principles are really important. If you can agree why you are coming together, and some basic principles that guide all the participants in any given situation, then you can pretty much leave them to get on with it.\u00a0 \u00a0</li>\n\n<li>minimal, and flexible, hierarchy;</li>\n\n<li>no or few managers;</li>\n\n<li>leaders, and groups, appear and disappear as the need requires;</li>\n\n<li>information flowing freely; and</li>\n\n<li>a \u201chigher authority\u201d, having legitimacy amongst the group, holding everything together through application of wisdom and moral authority, without ego and without controlling anything. These are sometimes called trustees.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nRegarding legal forms, my specific knowledge is about UK law. There's no perfect legal form for what we are talking about - existing legal forms (including cooperatives) still tend to assume ownership by someone. The problem with ownership is that (a) it is subtly demoralising to be owned by someone else and (b) ownership tends to be inflexible - once you are an owner there are not usually machanisms for you to give it up.\n\nBut that is not to say that you can't modify existing legal forms - the limited company for example is pretty flexible. You just need to adopt different rules. In teh UK we have something called a company limited by guarantee that can be turned into a for-profit, non-stock business that is business-like but doesn't distribute profit - it provides a space where profit and joy and meaning can be created and shared.\u00a0\n\nI am more than happy to contribute to this on-going conversation. I feel setting up more formally is a natural next step for edgeryders.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-04-05 21:01:18", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:56.471664", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 418, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 955, "user_id": 526, "topic_id": 922, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<strong>How can people make a living on the edge as technologies change quicker than regulations and new business models disrupt old standards? </strong>\n\nWhile young (and not so young) people are defining a new society through their networked interactions and processes, often the obstacles to their ability to make a living are bureaucratic or outdated ways of doing. However, those that are making a living are finding innovative ways to harness their networks and skills and are creating new methodologies, often unknowingly. The sharing of these experiences can contribute enormously to a knowledge base. of use to individuals as well as institutions and policy makers. We want to aggregate and distribute these stories and create a repository of useful, practical information which can be updated in real time. Through the Edgeryders site and social media channels, we aim to bring together many initiatives and experiences from within their own networks, to discuss and synthesise them on the platform, giving them a wider distribution. In this way we can amplify the conversation, reaching all stakeholders and bringing the real and practical experience of those living on the edge into sharp focus.

Not really, because burnout is more about \u201chow\u201d we work, that \u201chow much\u201d. So it\u2019s more nuanced than the work-life balance model. Burnout is not a problem of the individual but of the system, of the way we work, of how organisations are run (often bureaucratic, no matter if flat of top-down) and of the work culture itself.\n[/quote]\n\nIn my bubble, I know many who are definitely your target audience..

A highly interactive webinar to learn about opportunities in the EU and beyond. \n\nEvent date: 30th October 2020 at 18:00 - 20:00 CET or Brussels time.\nLocation: Zoom (the link will be sent 1 day before the event)\nOrganisers: EdgeRyders\nREGISTRATION: https://tell.edgeryders.eu/14305\n\n![Angelo di Mambro journalisming, in his own words|690x459](upload://o5N70ZSnq2n7F9b2tJA9f50K92n.jpeg) \n\n### Local farming in Central and Eastern Europe: we could look at the past and transform nostalgia into new ways\n\nIn the EU less than 10% are farmers under 35 years, but in Eastern Europe many more, and they tend to be different, they are more prone to innovation, to change mindsets and do new things. Most of them do agriculture in a more traditional way, where you are obliged to cope with nature and natural phenomena - floods, pests etc. Agriculture is slow, it cannot be fast, unless you grow vegetables in a greenhouse. Be careful: you cannot grow soy or beans, or wheat (the core of nutrition) in a greenhouse. The idea that greenhouses could feed the whole world is a myth.\n\nWhen the Berlin Wall fell down, the idea in some Eastern countries has been to transform the big state cooperatives into big enterprises: in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary. They have huge farms that they inherited, in a sense. But in Poland and Romania, it was the opposite: when I was in Cluj 10 years ago, I talked to a professor saying: with the agrarian reform every Romanian wants their own plot of land, but this is not feasible because they were too fragmented. In these countries, you have the big companies - that are not bad - but also the small ones, that want to find new ways and do something on their own - ex. I met shepherds that found a way to sell their milk and other products to local supermarkets. There is this feeling of nostalgia.\n\nBut when young farmers come in, they can transform nostalgia into something good.\n\n### Are public or private structures, or others, needed to support innovation in agriculture?\n\nTraditionally, innovation happened through researchers studying in the lab and then going to the field to show farmers what can be changed. After the Green Revolution, this has collapsed in the West, where food is no longer an issue of security, but where we think about new things. Corporate funding has replaced public funding, which is not entirely great - when you have public funding, you can do long term things, and bear the weight of asking questions for the environmental and social wellbeing. In corporate world, they want the return of investment, it\u2019s not their job to think in social terms.\n\nThe EU has tried to finance and to support bottom up operational groups in the [European Innovation Partnership in Agriculture (EIP AGRI)](https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/european-innovation-partnership-agricultural). They are conceived as heterogeneous, with farmers, NGOs, researchers. Even with public support, the solutions they find have problems to scale up and be replicable.\n\nThe issue of public support now is not giving money, is to interconnect these projects. You have a website with hundreds, thousands of projects, but who\u2019s going to connect the dots? If the state of public power does not do that, someone else has to.\n\nIn the webinar, everyone present will share about their project and ask questions to our guest and to the other participants. We want to learn together:\n* how local initiatives are confronted with the effects of covid19 \n* how your local governments are supporting or not your work\n* what are the main obstacles for your project or business\n* what collaborations are possible between farmers and local producers, food coops, and platforms for more sustainable local commerce and communities\n\n### Webinar Guest: \n**Angelo di Mambro** is a journalist who started focusing on agriculture and food in 2008, after the global price spikes in food commodities. The second wave of price spikes, in 2010, was even more impactful (it was one of the reasons behind the end of \u2018bread democracies\u2019 in the MENA region) and he had the chance to write, with others, a book edited by Paolo De Castro, MEP. The work had some little fortune in Italy and was accepted from an important niche [British publisher](https://www.amazon.com/Politics-Land-Scarcity-Earthscan-Agriculture-ebook-dp-B00ABM3FGS/dp/B00ABM3FGS/ref=mt_other). They were writing about sustainable development, but did not call it as such... Since 2016 Angelo has been covering also the EU news on climate, energy and environment. He is the \"Green Deal journalist\" for ANSA, the main Italian news agency. \n\n### Join our webinar on 30th October at 18:00:\n[Register here for the session.](https://tell.edgeryders.eu/14305) By registering, you will be directly introduced to our online conversation platform and you can immediately get in touch with others who will be attending.\n\nWho is it for?

An Edgeryder here made quite a strong case about \"hybrids\", the cross-disciplinary learners, stating that the only thing left for them to do is to become their own resource, and go for a more entrepreneurial path.

Exact number depends on the budin\n\n2. _The Budget_\nI need to update some numbers to get a clear idea.  In the meanwhile you guys should think about how to make it financially self-sustaining, so you can be independent from external funding since this was something you wanted to avoid. Let's touch base about this as soon as you have a couple of ideas to discuss?\n\n3. _The program_\nThis is something that you guys should discuss based on what you would like to achieve, and how you would like the camp to contribute to this. Think about what was said during the workshop as a point of departure? @zmorda is putting putting together a proposal for how to structure our steps moving forward in building Openvillage.

A mastodon instance can let other instances using AP read the public parts of outboxes, and write to the public part of inboxes.  This means Mastodon instances can federate, also with other AP implementations. (My WordPress blog has an AP endpoint so I can post to my blog to reach Mastodon users on some other instance. Though I don't do that currently)\n\nI run a Mastodon instance where I am the only user. From it I interact with others who can be on a variety of instances. Discovery is an issue there.

It mostly means they will be stuck in their own instance(s), as any other part of the network can choose to ignore them, and all of their traffic. Not as on Twitter, one troll at a time, but entire instances at once. \nBy keeping an instance small, internal moderation is easy (in my 1-person instance non-existent even), and small instances are much less likely targets as the attack-surface for trolling is so small, and each instance can cut-off any other. \n\nAn issue still is that most Mastodon users are on a hand-ful of instances, so there's not much real distributedness yet.\n\nSee https://m.tzyl.nl/@ton for my public Mastodon profile.", "created_at": "2019-11-14 21:52:09.033145", "updated_at": "2019-11-14 21:52:53.070686", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 323, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 46.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [64089], "is_liked_by": [2915, 4861], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29937, "user_id": 1081, "topic_id": 959, "post_number": 11, "raw": "Nathalie, I say: why is employment such a fetish?

The structure of demand on the forced labour market is shaped by two major agents: bureaucracy and corporations. Do they really provide that much value to the society? To us? Why should young, unspoiled people bend their minds to the turbo-capitalism employment model that - once triumphant - is now rotting? You said, more and more young people will be out of work now. This is the chance, not a threat. Look around - there is a vast area of social life being sadly neglected for decades, now being vividly rebuilt by those who are not on the labour market - The Commons, P2P, cooperatives. Isn't THIS a kind of change Edgeryders try to make? So, look beyond the market - and instead of turning our best, independent and brilliant minds into corporate cannon fodder, let's help them find their own way - with the huge benefit for the society. We do not need more sararimen. We need more Edgeryders - as they were meant to be. So do not shanghai our future leaders for the sake of the falling capitalism.

McKinsey earn billions, much of this money from public sources, to suggest free market growth-oriented solutions to problems that are fundamentally caused by those same forces. This report may appear to be concerned with social justice i.e. equipping disadvantaged people with skills to earn a living. But it is part of the movement to break up public provision of education, to privatise it, and to turn educational organisations into businesses preying on young people's fears about the future. Public educational organisations are blamed for not producing the right kinds of component workers, for not keeping up with fast-paced changes in technology etc. Some schools/colleges (e.g. in places like Finland, or alternative providers) are able to resist these pressures, but most are being forced to become feeders of industry rather than caring formers of whole, creative, autonomous people. I believe that companies and specialised professions should be responsible for funding and supporting training for work. This should be seen as work-based training rather than education. The more monotonous and tied to industrial production this work is, the less it should be implicated in education, which should be about growing people through diverse experiences. I believe that education should be vocational, hands-on and rooted in the real world - so I'm not arguing for education as a soft protected academic ivory tower. I don't think that industrial training prepares people to be as resilient, creative and empathetic as is required by the coming global shift. Vocational education should be about facilitating people to find their element and their calling. The report criticises education and industry for being in silos. I suspect the main problem is that education is not enough protecting children from industry.

We want to ensure that every participant leaves the venue having presented and discussed their work with others who can provide meaningful input or connect them with opportunities to further their professional and or personal development.  If this appeals to you, then we would love to have you join us. Just [create an edgeryders account](https://communities.edgeryders.eu/login) and [introduce yourself to the community here](https://edgeryders.eu/c/ioh/tell-us-about-you).  \n\n\n### How is this event being organised?\nThis event, and the festival it is part of, is  coordinated on the edgeryders platform (where you are now) and co-curated through a series of community video calls. We have allocated a collaboratively managed budget for the festival and operate on a solidarity basis. Participants who need some financial support to organise or be able to participate in the festival are eligible provided they contribute towards making it a meaningful and generative experience for all - in the run up to, during and/or after the event.

The consultation methodology is designed in such a way as to allow for diversity of views, premises, disciplines, themes and contexts. We employ open notebook science principles and the results will be presented in the form of a research report accessible to everyone after the event.

In the OpenCare research project we have an engagement strategy to converge project activities by ER, WeMake and all partners into stories and conversations between participants which would take place on this platform.

A lot of this is detailed issues.. not sure if this is the place for what could also be boring stuff for people not involved in the operational side of opencare.\n\nWhat would be great as an actionable for me is to convene key stories to be told in the community calls and report on those with minimum effort online.\n\nWe need to make it easier and cheap\u00a0for people to share stories.\n\nSo how about in the next community call we start with ourselves?

But most of the entrepreneurs, even social ones still pay 10 per cent and much more. They are not able to provide to their banks the required ROI and securities such as real estates, stocks and bonds.  - The private sector in most of the European countries is not able to provide capital and labour to integrate all people in a useful and productive framework of social activity. The Venture Capital Market in Europe is not able to provide capital for social ventures  to overcome social exclusion, unemployment and a growing poverty. The poverty creates high opportunity costs in social welfare, security and health which are paid today by local and national taxpayers. Therefore we founded the European People's Bank in order to bring the advantages of a peaceful and stable European Community directly to the people starting social ventures. How does the Bank work?\u00a0  The EPB is a cooperative. The members can have lots of 1000 Euro in the cooperative and have one voting right each. The lots build the Equity Capital of the EPB. Based on its Equity Capital, the EPB will take up capital from the European Central Bank at the current interest rate and provide it to Social Ventures with a maximum interest rate of only 50 per cent difference to the base rate of the ECB. Example:\n\n<strong>Base rate ECB</strong>: 0,75 per cent  \u00a0<strong>Credit rate EPB: 1,125 per cent</strong> In order to insure the quality of the projects and of course the solvency of the EPB every borrowing request has to pass a new form of external audit: the Social Capital Assessment. The assessment can be conducted online within a week only. That means: credit decisions can happen much faster. In the beginning the new stakeholders of the EPB can pay their lot on a frozen account on behalf of the EPB in order to get started. If the EPB will not start because of legal reasons, the money will be refunded. The aim is to finance \u20ac 500 billion Euros to providing in average \u20ac 100.000 per project \u2013 and therefore start Europe's biggest programme for occupation and social capital.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-12-01 22:50:15", "updated_at": "2017-09-23 13:41:41.117725", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 401, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 15.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 59193, "user_id": 4096, "topic_id": 10756, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Posting here the information about the next NGI Communication Training will be held  **Today at 15:00 via GoToMeeting**, organized by the @NGIOutreachOffice:  \n\nThe theme will be **How to tell your NGI story**.

Now if there\u2019s a new truth out there \u2013 a new order some of us want to join in building, for us personally the only thing left to do is participate, participate, participate. As innovators or supporters of innovation, or gentle carers or learners, which is where I find myself mostly. Out of the three misallocations you mention, I find the one on reputation (\u201cthe eyes of others\u201d) particularly hard to manage, for someone who\u2019s been promised a job and sees others having jobs, and has the resources to manage a job and live decently enough, even if not meaningfully, in the course of their lifetime. I think it\u2019s not the people living precariously and unemployed who are the most resistant to being part of the change, since some may have reached bottom in terms of reputation or had distinguishable paths allowing them to make alternative choices. The people who perpetuate the job paradigm need to be the ones making the switch, they have the most incentives to perpetuate it, and it\u2019s among those I find it the hardest to explain and rebuild reputation.

My comment below, sorry the long read.\n\nThough not being a lawyer, I can judge this case from my (living in EU) perspective, also thanks to being a MyData Founding Member\u00b2. There are some differences in EU vs. US copyright laws, also in the law systems (continental vs. case law). But 'FAIR use' is almost similar in both, and it can be defended in court. For (at least) FOUR DIFFERENT 'fair use' cases: \n(1) books in Accessible Formats, for Visually Impaired People VIP \n(2) for PRIVATE USE \n(3) for force-majeur circumstances, like IA did (when pandemia closed public library (PL) services. Some legal opinions here\u00b9) \n(4) as a human right case.\n\nFAIR use cases may look different in national legislatures, e.g. U.S. vs. Italian vs. Finnish; in U.S. there's 'exhaustion' of copyright\u00b3 (first-sale doctrine) when a book is legally owned, e.g. by buying it or via donation, \"forgotten\" by Alexander (who inaccurately\u2074 referred to Copyright law), quoted By TechRepublic\u2075. See very good comments in the IA blog\u2076 re. societal effects.\n\nBut I play safe (Case I), even though I'd like to defend these cases in court: I'll start my service **for Visually Impaired People** (VIP) ONLY, by leveraging The Marrakesh Treaty for VIP (U.S. is also a party, that signed the Treaty): it provides for right to copy (incl. right to order & to receive copy) - of copyrighted books without asking permission from a copyright owner.\n\nIn EU nation countries we have a paragraph in Copyright laws: right to make copIES for PRIVATE USE (\u2077Art. 12). Up to four copies\u2078, by Finnish law, for family members AND closest FRIENDS (Case II).\n\nMy plan: to start service #MyData #IndiviDUALbooks (B\u0153ks) \n- with 'fair use case I', for VIP only; \n- then to implement 'fair use case II', for PRIVATE uses, in Finland - to EU - to U.S. (maybe). I discussed it with libraries/lawyers in Finland: THOUGH IT'S A LEGAL RIGHT, NO-ONE WISHES TO RISK A LEGAL BATTLE. So, I may use 'a trick': data cooperatives\u00b9\u00b2 instead of PL.\n- 'fair use case III', for data cooperatives, see below\u00b9\u00b2,  in Finland - to EU - to U.S. (maybe)\n-  'fair use case IV', as-a-human-right, for force-majeur (pandemia), where applicable. \n\nCases III/IV - IF SUPPORTED by strong communities (like Edgeryders/ MyData).\n\nI like what IA did, but with all my due respect, I don't (yet) have resources to fight in court  against publisher monsters. I can only try to explain them that they lose more than gain, if opposing B\u0153ks (like in above Dutch-like* use cases).\nAlso like against Amazon's business model killing local businesses: my idea is here\u2079.\n\nThe Accessible Formats of books, provided by B\u0153ks innovation - is even an OBLIGATION for public services, by Accessibility laws. Though not enforceable yet, similar to GDPR's Article 20 (data portability). Nevertheless, I promote the Accessibility AND cost-efficiency of the B\u0153ks.\n\nThe U.S. Copyright Office\u00b9\u00ba stated that \"[t]he tangible nature of a copy is a defining element of the first sale doctrine and critical to its rationale.\"\u00b9\u00b9 Therefore, when DATA is not rival, a right to enjoy the PERSONAL DATA assets don't need to be protected in courts (like the threat to IA). It is a HUMAN RIGHT, like the right-to-internet in Finnish law, or the First Amendment in U.S. law. This is a long topic, but there's a good paper, that I plan to leverage for my next level ('fair use case III') in implementation my B\u0153ks, as-'The B\u0153ks for The Web': \u2018property-owning democracy\u2019 through personal data platform cooperatives'\u00b9\u00b2.\nI consider B\u0153ks a TRANSFORMATIVE use case, it's a ground for asserting B\u0153ks as FAIR use case: as we apply access to PERSONAL DATA assets into a PL book form-factor: MyData Label-Button approach / MyData Operators best practices access in1click at The Button,\n- for PERSONAL benefits, non-accessible without TRANSFORMATION into B\u0153ks. \n\nRe. 'the exclusive right of reproduction' vs. 'right to copy' (\u2077\"exclusive right to control\na work by reproducing it **AND** by making it available to the public\", Section 2).\n\nQuote from EFF: \"That (CDL program) means that if the Archive and its partner libraries have only one copy of a book, then only one patron can borrow it at a time, just like any other library.\" \nMy B\u0153k solution has three sub-solutions:\n(1) is similar to CDL, but in a PHYSICAL / PAPER form. It is (to be) supported by the novelty of Finnish law: royalty is paid to copyright owners when a book is loaned by a PL, also for e-books. A B\u0153k, when (a scan file is) sent to be printed, signals 'a loan event' to the relevant Finnish authority (state fund Sanasto), that provides royalty payments, for VIP\n- or even if a book is 'loaned' (a forthcoming, Peer-to-Peer, loan of a B\u0153k, received from a PL) by a natural person, i.e. not by a PL, but leveraging the PL's data / resources.

This includes author royalty.\nCase (3) differs \n- from case (1), by SEAMLESSNESS of non-availability of a book in case 1, for non-VIPeople, i.e. a patron must fulfill the request to share a B\u0153k (by postal service) - if such happens; \n- from case (2), by economical constraints: if a patron prints for ownership (i.e. not shares) more than one B\u0153k per year. \n\n\u00b9https://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/en-ca/knowledge/publications/00261309/pandemic-superior-force-force-majeure-and-its-impact-on-business-obligations-in-quebec\n\u00b2https://mydata.org/founders/\n\u00b3https://blog.archive.org/2020/06/01/four-commercial-publishers-filed-a-complaint-about-the-internet-archives-lending-of-digitized-books/\n\u2074https://www.techrepublic.com/article/is-internet-archives-unrestricted-lending-of-1-4-million-books-legal/\n\u2077https://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/kaannokset/1961/en19610404.pdf\n\u2078In Finnish language: instruction for users (2-4 copies allowed for family & closest friends \"perheen ja l\u00e4heisen yst\u00e4v\u00e4piirin v\u00e4lill\u00e4\"; SUBJECT TO remuneration to copyright owners by state fund), from Finnish Copyright authority https://tekijanoikeus.fi/tekijanoikeus/luvallinen-kaytto/\n\u2079https://twitter.com/SmartPaperVB/status/1269955167203528704\n\u00b9\u00bahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Copyright_Office\n\u00b9\u00b9https://www.copyright.gov/reports/studies/dmca/dmca_executive.html\n\u00b9\u00b2https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13698230.2020.1782046\n\u00b9\u00b3https://www.zdnet.com/article/copyright-alliance-blasts-internet-archives-emergency-library-launch-as-vile/", "created_at": "2020-06-29 15:29:12.705736", "updated_at": "2020-06-29 15:29:12.705736", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1214, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 27.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [79650], "is_liked_by": [2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6800, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3489, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Traditional knowledge</b>\n\nI am interested in the traditional knowledge stuff.

How are you making a living?** We\u2019re very interested to compare notes with peers in other parts of the world, young and not so young, especially in the following areas:\n\n1. **Getting paid work:** Where do you and your peers look for opportunities to work?  If you\u2019re a young graduate, do the skills you learned in school help?\n\n2. **Self-managed careers:** How are you making room for yourself as an entrepreneur or trail blazer in a field? What supports your work or service?\n\n3. **Poverty reduction:** Do you know of an initiative that helps people living in poverty make it to the next day? What started it and how are people coping, physically and psychologically? Tell us about it.\n\n**To participate in this conversation** simply create a new topic (click <kbd>+ New Topic</kbd>) and tell us about your experience.

The wheel, the printing press, the computer: all these can be described as social innovations, because they have radically changed the way we live. In some ways, in fact, all innovation is social! Yet, since the 1960s the term 'social innovation' has taken root in its own right as something quite different from innovation. It refers to innovations in those fields - education, healthcare, mobility, poverty, social exclusion, environmental sustainability, and other public goods - which are usually the responsibility of governments (the Public Sector) or the Third Sector (such as charity organisations), but which increasingly are being tackled by young (and less young) individuals with unprecedented creativity, skill and entrepreneurship. From micro-credit to Wikipedia, from time-banks to bike-sharing, social innovations are popping up all around us, and are changing the way we live, work, learn, travel, socialize and - most importantly - tackle some of today's most pressing social and environmental challenges.\n\nWith this in mind, here is your fourth mission within the 'make a living' campaign:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Find and describe a socially innovative company, initiative or project near you (if possible, interview the social innovator who made it possible) that you find inspiring. Do you think it has a chance to actually make the world a little better? Why? See a list of links below, divided by country.</li>\n\n<li>Would you work there? Why? Why do you think the founder ended up doing what they are doing instead of just taking a day job somewhere?</li>\n\n<li>If you are a social innovator, just tell us about your project!</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThis mission is done in collaboration with <a href=\"http://the-hub.net/\">The Hub Network</a>,  a global network of physical spaces where social innovators work together to make their projects come true.

I've been lucky enough to be a part of many reading groups, and convened a series myself (incidentally related to econ SF in that it was exploring speculative philosophy and political economics, with a focus on alternate systems of value). \n\nSo for this first reading group, my inclination is to go with two key texts that can give us all an orientation to the field. I suggest we don't go for reading anything longer than 60 pages in total so that it can be accessible to the diversity of backgrounds in the network and that we can all be confident in grasping foundational concepts.

And that you'll have to find your own perspective here, esp. given that hackerspaces in rural Tunisia are so rare.\n\nFor inspiration and exchange, here are some random pointers:\n\n* I know that @islem has a very similar idea for [Kebili](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kebili), also wanting to combine co-working with a hackerspace, to form an innovation lab and business incubator for the local economy. We discussed several possible variants when we met in Morocco last year. It seems you two should meet and talk ;) \n\n* [Communitere](https://communitere.org/) is a network of four independent hackerspaces focused on appropriate technology and low-infrastructure locations. At least [their space in Nepal](https://nepal.communitere.org/) combines the hackerspace with a co-working space. I know one person there and could try to connect you if you think it can help you with your planning.\n\n* Since you have so many women coming to your space, there are many women who could come to your hackerspace as well. Assuming that Tunisia is no different than the rest of the world then on average women will be a bit reluctant to enter this environment (\"full of tools and guys who claim to be better than the next guy using the same tool\"). In Nepal, one woman made good experiences with a ladies-only program in a local hackerspace there. You can read about it and about all the different events they organized on [makerkt.com](http://www.makerkt.com/) (\"maker keti\" = maker girl in Nepali).\n\n* The [Repair Cafe network](https://repaircafe.org/) is another inspiration for what a hackerspace can be good for, and one that is very useful for the \"more average\" person who does not come with a pet project or invention to work on in the hackerspace. There are 1900 repair cafes worldwide and 0 in Tunisia, yet.\n\n* A hackerspace can be started on very little money or very much money or anything in between. If you want to start with very little, you can bootstrap: start with some collected old hand tools and with their help, make better tools, repair broken tools that you get for free or cheap, harvest parts from all kinds of broken devices and household appliances, and in any other way make it a better hackerspace. In my experience, _all_ tools have value (even the rusty old semi-broken ones \u2026 because such tools are ok to \"sacrifice\" / adapt for the odd job that calls for a tool that does not exist anywhere). Building your own tools can be continued quite far, including building your own 3D printers from parts. Have a look at [reprap.org](https://reprap.org/) for that purpose.\n\n* Is there any 3D printer in Medenine already? If not, you may want to get one directly at the start of opening the hackerspace. It's a fascinating machine and practically useful, also to earn money. There are some good and very moderately priced (~250 EUR) Chinese clones of the original Prusa i3 3D printer (which is, I think, is currently the best open source 3D printer on the market, and a result of the RepRap project I linked to above).

Let's hammer it into a proper metadata strategy for the data of SSNA studies. \n\nThis ties into [this issue](https://github.com/edgeryders/discourse/issues/211): I hope to convince you, @matthias, that we do need a database entity to refer to a whole SSNA study. The reason is **metadata**, which are essential to understanding and reusing the data. Some metadata can be automatically generated from the data: for example, the duration of the conversation can be inferred from the timestamps of the posts; the duration of the coding from the timestamps of the annotations; the number of researchers involved from the names of the annotations' authors. But others cannot, specifically methodological choices informing the coding (\"we use a grounded theory approach...\", \"we chose to use names of individual technologies, and even of specific applications, as *in vivo* codes. This is because the study's ultimate purpose is to contribute to shaping technology policy...\". \n\nI find it useful to think about these things in terms of exporting a whole project for safekeeping on a repository such as Zenodo. What would a complete export look like? The ethnography proper would have:\n\n* pseudonymized topics and posts\n* annotations thereof, which include the associated codes\n* the codebook, automatically generated from the annotations and codes. It includes the discussion part as suggested by Matt.\n* methodological notes.\n\n@amelia, @ccs, @Leonie, am I missing anything?\n\nFor the SSN proper, we could take two roads.\n\nThe first is this: there is no need to export anything, because the SSN adds no information to the coded data. It is simply a network representation thereof. Interested researchers can rebuild it from the ethno data.\n\nAlternatively, we could add to our data either the Neo4j file powering Graphryder (after pseudonymization), or a docker file containing the whole Graphryder shebang. \n\nI think I am going to fork the final part of this discussion and move it to #ioh:workspace, so other partners in the consortium are more exposed to it.", "created_at": "2019-08-23 06:34:21.857651", "updated_at": "2019-08-23 06:35:15.154804", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 370, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 22.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [58266], "is_reply_to": [58266], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19089, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 3388, "post_number": 14, "raw": "<b>Seems great!</b>\n\nIf we're using MakerFox transfer there's no need to create a services catalogue right?\n\nWe only need to ask people to create user accounts and order a ticket, that's it from their side.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-07-30 06:29:17", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:46.453072", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 43, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [19086], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6379, "user_id": 3641, "topic_id": 6346, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hi all, yesterday (2nd of June) I had a Google Hangout with Noel Carrascal on designing the insulin construct. Relevant to @WinniePoncelet, @BramDeJaegher.\n\nPost-translational insulin consists of two chains (A and B) that are bonded through disulfide bonds. In humans this is obtained through post-translational modification of a single peptide chain. Such machinery is not available in an E. coli host. Noel is studying how to design the construct for insulin such that a the two parts can reliably find each other.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHis design is based on the strong affinity between barnase and barstar. Barnase (resp. barstar) are connected to one of the insulin chains using a linker. When the barnase-barstar complex is formed, insulin should form by proximity. This also circumvents the risk of the formation of two chains of the same kind bonding (A-A or B-B).\n\n\u00a0\n\nSuch insuline-barnase-barnstar complexes should aggregate into a large complex of many such molecules, from which pure, functional insulin can easily be cleaved. Admittedly, I did not follow this 100%.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe challenge here is to design such linker as such the complex can be formed. To this end, Noel writes his own software to do mechanistic molecular modelling. He computes all the molecular (polar, Vanderwaals, \u2026) interactions between amino acids to finally obtain the stability of a complex. For a given linker, this is represented by a set of (sparse) matrixes quantifying the strength of the interactions between the amino acids.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is the point where machine learning comes into play:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Using a set of example matrices, predict the matrices for new AA chains</li>\n\n<li>Perhaps use the information to directly build a model to predict stability of a given linker? The mechanistic information should somehow be used to improve the model (i.e. Vapnik\u2019s learning with privileged information)</li>\n\n<li>Given a model, optimize the linker (SA, GA\u2026)</li>\n\n<li>Bayesian optimization to search for promising under model uncertainty?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nMichiel out!\n\n", "created_at": "2017-06-03 08:37:46", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 03:29:49.898030", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 350, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 60.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 40436, "user_id": 1935, "topic_id": 7853, "post_number": 7, "raw": "@thomasviscom  @natalia_skoczylas", "created_at": "2017-12-16 11:05:46.617825", "updated_at": "2017-12-16 11:05:46.617825", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2, "wiki": false, "reads": 27, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 84022, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 14492, "post_number": 7, "raw": "Ping @alberto, @IvanC see first post (wiki) here for inventory of existing forms, their source codes and their outputs + partners\n\nIf you want a form generated i would like to ask you to post a reply here in future to try to bundel everything and keep track.", "created_at": "2020-09-30 12:54:19.195157", "updated_at": "2020-09-30 12:54:19.195157", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 47, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 12.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7782, "user_id": 3403, "topic_id": 704, "post_number": 2, "raw": "hello, maybe I can be of help for the chapter 'how to cope with emotional/mental suffering' in your handbook.

Ils ont \u00e0 nouveau une Maison du Peuple!\n\nCe temple architectural est \u00e9videmment d\u2019abord un choix symbolique. Apr\u00e8s y avoir accept\u00e9 la tr\u00e8s controvers\u00e9e exposition Behind The Numbers glorifiant le n\u00e9o-liberalisme, la Ville s\u2019est rendue compte qu\u2019il fallait donner une autre destination \u00e0 cet endroit que celle de pure sp\u00e9culation commerciale et d'activit\u00e9 touristique. En transformant une partie de la Bourse en Maison du Peuple elle redonne une place aux Bruxellois au c\u0153ur du centre historique!\n\n<strong>Donnez la ville aux habitants, et tout le monde s\u2019en portera mieux</strong>\n\nOn ne comptait plus le nombre d\u2019actions contre les plans de la Ville: plates-formes citoyennes, regroupements de commer\u00e7ants, actions ludiques diverses... Qui ne se souvient du banc de 30 m d\u00e9pos\u00e9 au milieu de la Grand place, ou des centaines de gens pique-niquant place de la Bourse, de l'action de revendication des escaliers de la Bourse comme tribune libre d'expression politique lors du KunstenFestivaldesarts? L\u2019espace public \u00e9tait devenu un haut lieu de d\u00e9bat, mais paradoxalement ne recevait pas d\u2019endroit ad\u00e9quat pour le mener (une Agora). La participation ne remuait que du vent, les riverains ne se sentaient pas entendus. La ville \u00e9tait taill\u00e9e sur mesure pour les eurocrates, les touristes Chinois, avec commerces ouverts le dimanche, tandis que le Bruxellois devait se contenter d\u2019une ville certes prestigieuse, mais sans lieu o\u00f9 il fait bon vivre, une ville d'exp\u00e9riences individuelles juxtapos\u00e9es, atomis\u00e9es, sans liens.\n\nLe Beer Tempel projet\u00e9 dans le Palais de la Bourse aura une entr\u00e9e par l\u2019arri\u00e8re, et c'est tr\u00e8s bien ainsi. Mais sans occuper tout l'espace, il comprendra une nouvelle Maison du Peuple, o\u00f9 chacun pourrait d\u00e9battre de ce qui se passe dans la ville, o\u00f9 les initiatives bottom-up pourront cro\u00eetre, de nouvelles id\u00e9es pour une ville meilleure surgir. Il importe de faire de ce lieu symbolique qu'est la Bourse un espace de libre d\u00e9bat, une Agora. Il s'agit de rendre la ville aux habitants pour que tout le monde en profite, pour que l\u2019habitant s\u2019y sente bien. Alors le touriste, le commer\u00e7ant et tout les autres s'y sentiront bien <em>aussi</em>.\n\nLa Ville esp\u00e8re avec cette Maison du Peuple calmer les tensions palpables par le biais d\u2019une communication plus ouverte: un endroit de rencontre et d\u2019\u00e9coute sera ainsi am\u00e9nag\u00e9 dans le b\u00e2timent. En revitalisant de cette fa\u00e7on la Bourse, en lui donnant une \u00e9chelle humaine, la Ville aide \u00e0 fabriquer le tissu social des prochaines d\u00e9cennies. Bien s\u00fbr, le touriste y aura sa place, car la Maison du peuple sera ouverte a tous.

I am an economist and <a href=\"http://www.cottica.net\">a blogger</a>; most of my work has been in the areas of the creative economy and, in the past five years or so, Internet-enabled public policy. I am passionate about building safe, constructive spaces for citizens and public administrators to interact directly, without going through intermediaries; to some degree, I have been able to do so in the past, directing fascinating projects like <a href=\"http://www.visioniurbanebasilicata.net\">Visioni Urbane</a> (collaboratively designing and business planning five art centers in a Southern Italian region) and <a href=\"http://www.progettokublai.net\">Kublai </a>(an online community of fledgling creative industries entrepreneurs, rolled out by the Italian central government). I am the author of several essays and a book called <a href=\"http://www.cottica.net/wikicrazia\">Wikicrazia</a>. I am also active in the open government/open data movement. I had a previous career as a professional <a href=\"http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberto_Cottica\">punk-folk musician</a> (ahem). I joined the Social Cohesion Research and Early Warning Division to build Edgeryders as my contribution to the European project. I am very grateful for it: it is not perfect, but it gave us 70 years of peace after centuries of Europeans slaughtering each other. Plus it broadens our horizons, allowing us to live, work and study in a much broader space than the one that was available before. Edgeryders itself is a manifestation of that space. I am very much looking forward to meeting you all in it. :-)\n\n", "created_at": "2011-10-13 06:17:13", "updated_at": "2017-09-21 13:49:18.686567", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 325, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22462, "user_id": 472, "topic_id": 1273, "post_number": 15, "raw": "<b>A lot of patience</b>\n\nLyne,\n\nCertainly is not easy, and many times it is discouraging.\n\nBut you should not lose hope, you have to seek more support, you can not be alone in this adventure.\n\nYou may mark small steps (realistic steps) that help you see you are progressing.\n\nAnd a lot of patience! :)\n\nBy the way, in this case, I personally don't think language is a problem, (and you know we also have our language in Catalonia, in a Spanish state dominated by another language).\n\nRegards.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-24 09:32:14", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:05.006737", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 104, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [13067], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 78840, "user_id": 6442, "topic_id": 13853, "post_number": 4, "raw": "I shared on Linkedin (where my network are) and added #jobfairy too ;)", "created_at": "2020-06-12 10:19:58.426476", "updated_at": "2020-06-12 10:19:58.426476", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 12, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 27.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5662], "is_private": false}, {"id": 78862, "user_id": 5662, "topic_id": 13853, "post_number": 9, "raw": "\ud83d\ude0d Amazing, thanks!", "created_at": "2020-06-12 11:25:34", "updated_at": "2020-06-12 11:29:53.873429", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 7.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [78840], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 78870, "user_id": 3703, "topic_id": 13853, "post_number": 10, "raw": "@ichraf", "created_at": "2020-06-12 12:55:09.736949", "updated_at": "2020-06-12 12:55:09.736949", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 7.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [78846], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 61519, "user_id": 5201, "topic_id": 10960, "post_number": 9, "raw": "The deliverables are on the Drive folder since a few days, I shared them on the chat but better add the link here too. \nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1oAYx8REBB1FR6uLyGlPW3tQ4K_wMW3mT", "created_at": "2019-10-16 16:03:47.116184", "updated_at": "2019-10-16 16:03:47.116184", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 33, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 6.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 78474, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 13819, "post_number": 15, "raw": "I do not think it is a good idea.", "created_at": "2020-06-08 13:28:06.333365", "updated_at": "2020-06-08 13:28:06.333365", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 9, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 6.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [78473], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 78475, "user_id": 5667, "topic_id": 13757, "post_number": 9, "raw": "@owen @nadia @hugi @nirgal - any news for you schedule tomorrow at 10h?

Code review (15m) \n4. Graphryder updates? (5m)\n\nTrying to be accountable to what we discussed at the last meeting about being mindful about the time by structuring the meeting. Feel free to add/edit/adjust the items and time.\n\n**Call Notes**: \n*present: Amelia, Leonie, Kate, John, Maria.* \n\n**Debrief AMA** \nHad a good turnout, but the conversation topic varied widely. To address this, we agreed that from now on, when our team reaches out to speakers, we will propose a topic area. That way, the publicity posts and speaker's intro post can clearly signal to participants what we will be discussing. It will also add the kind of ethnographic depth that we wnated from the AMAs to begin with. \n\n**Across-project concerns, etc.** \nWe have plenty of rich content on platform as @nadia has pointed out, so the remainder of our time will be focused on the two tasks below: interpreting and analysing the content we have, and making sure that all of the rich community contributions are coded. This means that the most useful work @johncoate and @MariaEuler can do in collaboration with us is help us identify and prioritise what to analyse and discuss (of what is already coded, for example) and what should be coded with priority.\n\nWe need to do this in a structured, not ad-hoc, way, lead by the ethnographic analysis. This means being proactive rather than reactive with our analytical frames, making sure they emerge from community contributions and our ongoing analysis/ontology. \n\nTo best cover these tasks and produce rigorous and reflective analysis, @Leonie will focus on moving us into a more intensive interpretive analysis phase and @katejsim will focus on coding, making sure our ontology stays rigorous and supports the interpretive work we will all be doing in the latter months of the project. \n\n1. @Leonie will publish monthly reports from the ethnography team which begin the more analytical/interpretive phase of our work. These will be based upon:\n\n* bi-weekly ethno team/code review meetings, which will now be in part geared more toward big-picture thinking about the project as a whole, where we decide the topic and focus of the report. \n\n* conversations with @MariaEuler and @johncoate about what interesting threads they've read / reflections from community members.\n\n* quotes from threads assembled on an ethno quote thread (https://edgeryders.eu/t/community-member-quote-thread/15106) with some context added, which anyone can add to the thread (specifically useful for @johncoate and @MariaEuler). These will help us when we are assembling reports to the commission/writing papers, so we can have the voices of the community in them.   \n\n* discussions with Nesta findings/other partner findings, @nadia's topics of interest, etc.\n\n* GraphRyder visualisations (with assist from @alberto if anything cool is emerging that a different Tulip look could enhance). \n\nIf people are interested in having the ethnography team explore a topic, we will look to include it in the monthly report. \n\nThe first report will be released at the beginning of February. \n\n2. @katejsim is focused on coding and will invest her time in getting as much of the existing corpus coded as possible. @amelia will code as well.\n\n**Code review**\nWe reviewed coding memos that @katejsim and @leonie shared ahead of the meeting. We will spend the first meeting in 2021 doing rigorous code reviews. \n\n**GraphRyder**\nHas now been updated.

Rutger Breghman is one of their strong writers who brought the ideas around Basic Income to the masses but at the same time being really humble in his creation of ideas, coming back on older ideas and rediscussing them. My favorite series on their website is 'the declaration of dependence', a series of articles about how we can create a more trustworthy and humain society by depending on one another. \nThey have a great system to highlight their resources, every piece is clickable and there is an interesting paywall. In fact they just put a paywall on the site to get access to all the content, but if you click on an article anybody posts from the website you can read the full article, this i find really great. \n\nUsbek & Rita https://usbeketrica.com\n\nThis is a much more humanistic technological centered site that has a great community involved dynamic. it has it's own currency that can be used to get access to specific parts or live events and you earn it by sharing, discussing or helping to write/ correct some of the articles. It are high quality but quite easy to read articles.

I think that a \"farmer/researcher\", perhaps also working a consultant for other farms, is totally a viable idea. Because farming has, or should have, quite a large knowledge work component to it. It's not like large-scale commercial farmers nowadays would knowingly and intentionally degrade and destroy their land \u2013 they just don't know any better how to farm profitably without degrading the land and are somehow forced to think in short timescales, such as the 30-50 years until the topsoil might have gone from their land.\n\nThat's how I came to like stories of industrial farmers who changed their ways and are now evangelizing among other farmers about the restoration techniques they discovered. I have found several of these stories, but this one is the best: [Peter and Stuart Andrews' Natural Sequence Farming](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-10-29/10312844), dealing with water cycle restoration on cattle farms in Australia.\n\nLike their farm consultancy for industrial farms, small farms and urban gardens also need knowledge input. I would not know how to make a properly paid job out of consulting small farms and gardeners, though \u2026 except maybe if you'd combine it with a webshop or dropshipping store that also sells innovative gardening and urban farming products. There is so much hardly known tech for small-scale farming out there (and one might also  add own developments over time).

The basic graph structure is something like this:\n\n![image|369x516, 75%](upload://imxDWHlpR3LHGKk2TjM0BUyC9CR.png) \n\nEntities in the graph are: \n\n1. authors (participants)\n2. their posts\n3. ethnographic annotations\n4. ethnographic codes. \n\nThe types of relationships involved are:  \n\n1. Authors write posts.\n2. Posts may reply to other posts.\n3. Annotations annotate posts.\n4. Annotations invoke codes.\n\nThese relationships are fundamental: we cannot deduce them from the data, only create them when authors write posts, or ethnographers code them. But there are other types of relationships that we can deduce from the fundamental ones, through a technique called projection. The most important ones are: \n1. A *social* relationship between authors: author Alice is talking to (or engaging with) author Bob when Alice writes a post that is a reply to a post written by Bob. \n2. A *semantic* relationship between codes: code C1 co-occurs with C2 when there exist two annotations A1 and A2 where A1 invokes C1, A2 invokes C2, and A1 and A2 annotate the same post.\n\nIn the case above, these relationships do not appear. There is only one author, Alice, and only one code, C1. But imagine now the ethnographers creates a second annotation on the same post, and invokes a new code C2. Like this:\n\n![image|690x298](upload://64ZrKMvHRu7ToxSmBJqRHpV9WzB.png) \n\nNow, the codes co-occurrence network shows that C1 and C2 co-occur once, because they are both invoked by annotations to post P1. The number of co-occurrences is represented by the weight of the co-occurrences edge. The interaction network shows only Alice, interacting with no one. \n\nSuppose now that Alice's post was in fact a reply to a post written by Bob. The situation is now this: \n\n![image|690x292](upload://nYfAnu1QreSiHUokTCAaiRCTigd.jpeg)  \n\nWith no more annotations, the codes co-occurrence network is unchanged. But the interaction network now shows a link from Alice to Bob, symbolizing engagement. This edge, too, is weighted: the more replies Alice writes to Bob, the heavier the edge. \n\nEvery addition to the conversation database (authors writing posts, ethnographers adding annotations and codes) is encoded this way. So, you can think of coding as drawing networks. With every annotation, researchers using Open Ethnographer are adding nodes and edges to the conversation's semantic social network, more specifically to its semantic part, the codes co-occurrence network. \n\n## Multiple annotations on a single post induce a clique\n\nWhen a researcher adds an annotation to a post in OpenEthnographer, the code invoked by it will by construction co-occur with *all* the codes invoked by the other annotations on the same post. So, any  post whose annotations invoke two or more codes gives rise to a  *clique* of codes \u2013 a completely connected network, or part thereof. The number of edges in a clique depends on the number of nodes. In an undirected network like the codes co-occurrence network:\n\n* With 2 annotations, you get 1 co-occurrence edge.\n* With 3 annotations, you get 3 co-occurrence edges.\n* With 4 annotations, you get 3 co-occurrence edges.\n* With `n` annotations you get `(n * (n - 1)) / 2` edges.\n\nIf you visualize the full co-occurrences network (including edges of weight 1), rich posts are easy to spot as very dense cliques, often connected to the rest of the graph by only one or few codes:\n\n![image|690x424](upload://theK3EUz9tCBjLOHw89inlxaxz0.jpeg) \n\n## Interpreting repeated co-occurrences \n\nWhen doing SSNA, i.e. the analysis of semantic social networks, you would not attribute a great deal of importance co-occurrence edges of weight 1. There are two reasons for this, one conceptual and one network-structural.\n\nThe conceptual reason is this. SSNA is a quest for *collective* intelligence. It aims to capture how *a group in conversation*, not a single individual or a collection thereof, see something. By construction, an edge of weight 1 in the codes co-occurrence graph means that the two codes in question occurred together in the same post only once; posts can only have one author, so only one individual has made that association explicitly, only once. This does not qualify as collective intelligence. When the same co-occurrence repeats itself across multiple posts, it is likely to encode an association supported by the collective. **We treat repeated co-occurrence as a signature of collective intelligence**.\n\nThe network-structural reason is that a rich post might well have 20 annotations with 20 different codes. This means 190 edges. The number of edges in the graph can easily become dominated by a few rich posts. There is no elegant solution for this. \n\nSome network scientists dealing with interconnected cliques like to assume that all cliques (not all edges) have the same weight, equal to 1. They, then, rescale the weight of the edges by the inverse of the number of edges therein. In our case, this would mean assuming each post has one \"vote\" to spend. If a post is annotated invoking four codes, each of its `4 * 3 / 2 = 6` edges would have weight 1/6. A post with only two codes invoked would give rise to a single edge of weight 1, and so on. \n\nWe do not consider this to be a good solution for online ethnography. A large number of annotations on a post tends to mean that that post is indeed very rich in meaning (and often longer than average). It is by no means clear that the connections across these codes would be of less value than those stemming from posts with only 2 or 3 codes. \n\nInstead, we filter out all one-off connections, and consider only the co-occurrences that appear at least *twice* in the corpus. This:\n\n* Anchors more firmly our claim that the codes co-occurrence network has something to do with collective intelligence.\n* Gets rid of the cliques.\n* Simplifies dramatically the graph: in our studies so far one-off co-occurrences make up about 90% of all co-occurrences.", "created_at": "2020-06-29 16:25:04.323131", "updated_at": "2020-06-29 19:08:17.692879", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1014, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 12.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 78227, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 13750, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Sorry, was to late to respond in time.", "created_at": "2020-06-03 18:26:06.126962", "updated_at": "2020-06-03 18:26:06.126962", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 8, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 6.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [78089], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19600, "user_id": 105, "topic_id": 3119, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Public Innovation Places</b>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://nyc.pubcollab.org/files/Gov_Innovation_Labs-Constellation_1.0.jpg\" style=\"width: 720px; height: 433px;\">\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnother possibly relevant article: \"There is a growing perception that the state\u2019s ability to provide various forms of public service can be enhanced through public-private partnerships, the use of new technologies, as well as various strategies for increased public participation. \"\u00a0http://nyc.pubcollab.org/public-innovation-places/#govlabs\n\nWho BTW works on follow up after <a href=\"http://www.matera-basilicata2019.it/it/archivi/news/482-a-matera-la-waag-society-di-amsterdam.html\">workshop with Waag Society couches</a> ? <a href=\"/u/ben\">@Ben</a>\u00a0<a href=\"/u/mariabyck\">@mariabyck</a>\n\n", "created_at": "2014-06-08 10:28:18", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:49.242521", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 127, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32641, "user_id": 330, "topic_id": 1625, "post_number": 18, "raw": "<b>*#Lote : Cr\u00e9ation \"Think Tank\" officiel Edgeryders...*</b>\n\n<div>\n\n<font class=\"Apple-style-span\" color=\"#333333\" face=\"'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif\"><strong>My Recommendations \\#Lote...</strong></font>\n\n<font class=\"Apple-style-span\" color=\"#333333\" face=\"'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif\"><strong>Rapport Final,</strong></font>\n\n<font class=\"Apple-style-span\" color=\"#333333\" face=\"'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif\"><strong>\u00a0projets port\u00e9s par le Conseil de l'Europe &amp; la Commission Europ\u00e9enne :</strong></font>\n\n<font class=\"Apple-style-span\" color=\"#333333\" face=\"'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif\"><b><span>1.

We decided to organise a as a do-ocracy: who does the work calls the shots, no veto power etc. This means the checks and balances are encoded as permission to do, rather than power to stop others from doing. This can be a bit hard edged on the more meditative people, and does require a certain degree of trust. If you think people are out to get you, you will demand veto power on what they do lest they damage you. It's not for everybody, I acknowledge it.\u00a0\n\nAlso, it is important to manage expectations. We are a tiny company that barely exists, trying to navigate a symbiosis with an online community. We have decided to be very transparent, and to issue a blanket permission for people to use our brand and corporate infrastructure for a variety of purposes. But that's where the buck stops. We are not a democracy, and do not offer the accountability of a major government. We want to spend time building, not justifying <em>why</em> we build,\u00a0and certainly not debating <em>what</em> we should build.\u00a0Anybody wants Edgeryders to build X, get in the game, find the resources needed and lead. We'll help if we can, and we can lend the track record and corporate infrastructure of Edgeryders to do it. But no more. No consensus, no collective decision making. They are too slow, and incentivise people to gain prominence by stopping others from doing what they want to do. This is terribly unfair towards doers (watch Billy, who has never led a project in Edgeryders or found a client, suggest how we should run things).\u00a0We want to encourage people to try things out, and have designed our rules to protect efforts to do so.\u00a0Our direction evolves by trial and error: someone tries something, it works, so people take notice and do more of it.\u00a0\n\nIf this does not work, evolution will wipe Edgeryders out. In this case, we will still have made a contribution, trying out a way to do things, and paying ourselves the price for its failures. Meanwhile, everyone else can try their own ways.

For any questions or comments, add a reply to the thread.** \n\n# Introduction into H2020 Call Context\n\nEurope wants to become the leader in the field of collective intelligence and is uniquely positioned to do so. Its values of interoperability, privacy and decentralised power are foundational for an open web and the emergence of collective intelligence.\n\nThe upcoming [ICT-54-2020 call](https://www.ngi.eu/news/2019/07/23/ict-54-2020-call---blockchain-for-the-next-generation-internet/) allows a consortium of organisations to apply for an \u20ac8m funding pot of which they have to distribute \u20ac6m to outstanding academic research groups, hi-tech start-ups, SMEs and others, contributing to the research and innovation area via cascade funding model. The Commission considers proposals with an overall duration of 24 to 36 months. Third parties will be funded through projects, typically in the EUR 50,000 to EUR 200,000 range per project, with an indicative duration of 12 months.\n\n**The deadline is January 16. 2020. (very tight)**\n\nOne of the subtopics of the call is:\n\n**\"Bringing forward the emergence of collective intelligence on the internet\"**\n\n* developing approaches for scientific understanding and technology-based stimulation of collective intelligence on social media and the internet to foster trustworthy knowledge and information sharing, and to enhance social inclusion. Focus is on two main use cases:\n  1. develop new community-based service models on social networks that exploit collective intelligence to provide enhanced community services, and increase the availability of trustworthy content;\n  2. in the context of collective intelligence develop and implement new concepts for connecting people and smart objects/agents/AI on social media.\n* Approaches for both use cases must be rooted in scientific analysis of collective behaviour and network mechanisms, harness decentralised technologies such as P2P or blockchain for governance and support a dependable collective memory.\n\n# Proposal Summary:\n\n### WISDOM - Human & community centric incubator for P2P knowledge and collective intelligence software.\n\n## Vision\n\nThe space of knowledge management and social media applications is dominated by players who's economic reward models force them to create lock-ins, therefore severely limiting the free flow of information, data and social interoperability and collective intelligence. Their centralised power allows them to be manipulated to spread low quality information, influence elections and abuse user's privacy and freedom of choice.\n\nThe web is already decentralised and interoperable. Therefore only funding organisations with new decentralised technologies, like Blockchain, won't solve these issues. \nTo get another leap forward in the web's potential to foster collective intelligence we need to also change the economic models and recreate an environment of human centric & ethical service design, freedom-of-provider-choice (open markets) and democratic peer2peer communication. \n\nWe believe that 4 components are key for achieving this:\n\n1. Economic and business models that\n   * align with the principles of interoperability by implementing investor reward models that cap returns and make organisations non-tradeable (like Steward Ownership, Cooperatives, NPOs, Open Science Research, Open Source Output)\n     * Those models need to prevent a growth-at-all-cost mindset and incentivise organisations to be service/profit oriented instead.\n   * protect user data from being sold as a commodity and out of hands of (European) citizen\n   * create incentives for organisations to collaborate more on shared infrastructure so they can grow together, not alone, and overcome the tragedy of the commons.\n2. Interoperability to create USPs of freedom and perfectly user adapted tools that monopolistic organisations have a hard time competing with. Interoperability should be implemented with special focus on:\n   1. Data Portability\n   2. Social interconnectivity (allowing users to switch providers and still communicate with their 'old' peers & social connections, like email)\n   3. User centric adaptability: Users can easily experiement & upgrade to state-of-the-art technologies and protocols outside of a single company's control.\n   4. Algorithmic freedom to democratise people's ability to control their information diet and bubble\n   5. Modularity to enable user choice in service providers (e.g. using different default search engines in a browser)\n3. Open Source software to create shared infrastructure and lower development costs\n4. On/offline facilitation to foster emergent, scalable & co-creative communities, and individual/leaders that are aligned with their self and purpose.\n\n## Incubator Program\n\nThe proposed incubator program for P2P knowledge and collective intelligence tools aims to grow a community of economically sustainable organisations that co-develop the technological, economical and social infrastructure for increasing the capacity for collective intelligence online.\n\nIt's key components are: \n* Communicating and co-evolving [a larger vision of collective intelligence](https://community.worldbrain.io/t/why-worldbrain-io-does-not-take-venture-capital/75) that is made possible by interoperable and hyper-adaptable human centric knowledge/social software and non-exploitative economic models.\n* Preferring applicants that\n  * use investor reward models that do not create incentives for growth-at-all-cost but for being service focused, like Steward Ownership or Cooperative models. VC or ICO funded companies will only be accepted in special cases, where such a focus can be successfully argumented.\n  * use business models that protect privacy/data ownership and user data from being sold as a commodity\n  * develop modular software & apply interoperable standards/protocols\n* Facilitating a individualised learning/acceleration journey for teams and individuals in:\n  * human centred product & service design\n  * ethical principles of next generation social and knowledge software\n  * how to build businesses that can sustain themselves before funding period ends\n  * personal development to increase leadership skills and ethics, and ability to collaborate with peers\n  * the ecology and interconnectivity of the proposed solutions\n  * organisational development to determine value systems, purpose and directions\n* Faciltiating on/offline community with battle-tested practices for emergent community design to stimulate knowledge transfer and shared (software) development\n  * previous approaches have resulted in little co-creation and shared direction between projects, and therefore lower efficiency of deployed money.\n\n# Consortium Partners & Roles:\n## Technology Partner: [WorldBrain.io](http://WorldBrain.io)\n\n[WorldBrain.io](http://worldbrain.io) is a steward owned company developing open-source, offline-first & P2P knowledge and collective intelligence applications.\n\nTheir role in the consortium is:\n\n* providing [the initial technological, ethical, conceptual and economic vision](https://community.worldbrain.io/c/visions) for a human/community centric & interoperable network of knowledge and collective intelligence tools that is further developed together with the community in an open process.\n* providing modular, reusable, open source boilerplates for offline-first & p2p knowledge & collective intelligence applications to speed up development of new tools.\n  * Memex: A online research tool to full-text search web history, annotate, co-curate and discuss web content, and collaborate with peers.\n  * Storex: A user controlled, interoperable and adaptable storage layer for knowledge management data.

I was curious, as I know @howard_rheingold in person, and was happily surprised to see this is a Discourse site running! \n\n[quote=\"edgeryders, post:1, topic:9790\"]\nWhat is a burning question that drives your work?\n[/quote]\n\nI don't reason in terms of a single question to drive my work, let alone it be a _burning_ question. If I would, I guess it would go something like: **given the current trends in energy consumption, what must we do to prevent the extinction of complex life on Earth and shift -- if at all possible -- to a way of life that makes us humans part of the global organism we call our planet?**\n\n[quote=\"edgeryders, post:1, topic:9790\"]\nHow did you get started and what hurdles have you met along the way?\n[/quote]\n\nI was born, which is how we all get started. Then someday I hit a keyboard, sent an email, got response. It changed my life as I realized the Internet could be a life-changing phenomenon. In the last five years though, I tend to consider high-tech as more of a burden than a liberating mean, as too many critical people are not (going to be) using it, especially peasants, who are about the only people who can save us from the greed of obsolete economic and political theories. But I digress -- or not: maybe this the biggest hurdle I've met along the way, maybe it is really ; that _people in charge_ try to follow a normative model that does no-one any good, including themselves. I was lucky enough to spend some quality time -- although not enough -- with @howard_rheingold and what I learned from him is that brilliance requires a lot of compassion and love for life -- but not _Life_ in an abstract sense, but _incarnate life_, with strong presence to oneself and the others around you ; and this is not something that can find any technological solution. I bet if people were happier about their life on Earth, we'd be living with much less, in much better conditions. But... \n\n[quote=\"edgeryders, post:1, topic:9790\"]\nWhich doubts do you have about the work you are doing and the path forward?\n[/quote]\n\nLike everyone else I guess, I must compose with forces going in other directions. My biggest doubt, especially with the COVID-19 crisis, is that people may not be capable of getting rid of their over-costly habits -- when I hear that we should be \"catching up with what we 'missed' from being confined\" and that would be more energy consumption, more competition, more production, I have serious doubts we can make it.\n\n[quote=\"edgeryders, post:1, topic:9790\"]\nWhat kind of support would you like to offer others traveling a similar path?\n[/quote]\n\nNever give up. If it seems impossible, it's probably because you're looking at it from, or \"through _unearthly_ angles\". Reality is entangled, and there _is_ \"spooky action at a distance\". What you see, is not what you get. And in @howard_rheingold's words: \n\n[quote=\"howard_rheingold, post:4, topic:12971\"]\nwhat it is \u2014> is \u2014>up to us\n[/quote]\n\n### So, why this topic's name: \"Towards a Public Digital Infrastructure\"? \n\nWell, I was eating from the trash, living in a squat, hacking away. And I met many other people in the same case, hacking on free software, privacy-enhancing software, software that was being critical to many other people organizing around the world. And every time the same topic was coming back: we lack funds. We're broke. We can't compete against giants... In 2012, a number of people gathered during the Berlin Art Biennial to discuss peer-to-peer Internet systems. Everyone had the same problem. So I started working on it. I met people. I looked around, asked around. In 2017 I founded the Public Universal Base: Libre Infrastructure Community (PUBLIC). We gather like-minded people, we go after funding. One call at a time. And from the dozen projects who were part of the 2012 P2P meeting in Berlin, I'm happy to say that most of them are now funded. Thanks to this cooperative effort of a bunch of people who, behind the scenes, build capacity for the free software community. And NGI has been helpful so far in this direction, but we're light-years away still to shift the paradigm from competition to cooperation, where all our efforts should be going since we do not have much time left to keep our civilization from crashing. The NGI effort is a tiny piece of the huge European construct. As it slowly grows towards acceptance of free software and the Commons, we humans have a chance to shift away from self-destruction.\n\nThank you for your attention.", "created_at": "2020-06-03 19:34:24.986187", "updated_at": "2020-06-03 19:34:24.986187", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 863, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 72.6, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [52764, 72485], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4934, 4861, 2915, 4022], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26357, "user_id": 196, "topic_id": 1957, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Thanks Ben</b>\n\nThanks a lot Ben, everything's fine.\u00a0\n\nYour comments makes me think that\u00a0my words sounded more tragic than I wanted to (probably because of my bad Englsh ;).\n\n<span>Anyway thanks a lot for your kind words, everything you say makes a lot of sense and it is how I intend to be involved into this.</span>\n\n<strong>I would need by Sunday </strong>any 3d, sections drawingds\u00a0of the building in order to work with my students (I don't have any drawing to understand floors and elevations, heights, etc...).\n\nIs there any section of the building (already asked to [antonioelettrico] bu he didn't know)?\n\nOn monday I will present the unMonastery to the students and I think I will use the old presentation on slideshare if there is nothing similar more up to date.\n\nLETS'S KEEP WORKING AND ...

Riccardo at <a href=\"/u/bergamo_hub\">@Bergamo-Hub</a>, I think, would rather be here. It's like Jane Jacobs used to say: the kitchen is the most cozy and most intensely used room in most houses,\u00a0<em>because</em>\u00a0it is multi-functional. People hang out there, and some random interaction ensues that makes life more interesting and warms the heart. This space, I would argue, is the unMonastery's kitchen on the web: the unBrethren hang out as they go about their various errands, and they don't mind sparing a minute to speak their mind on the Bergamo endeavour.\n\nProvisionally, that is. At some point the discussion on unMonastery Bergamo might become too cumbersome. The good thing about the Edgeryders data model based on projects (group nodes in Drupal) is that you can reassign any post, task, wiki, event or what have you from one group to another in seconds. Also, you can assign them to multiple groups. So, if the unMonastery Bergamo discussion takes off and becomes unwieldy, we can create a new project; move over all discussions about it (including this one) with a couple of clicks; and simply go on there. The platform takes care of all redirects, so links do not get broken.\u00a0\n\nI am smiling to myself as I write this. <a href=\"/u/elf_pavlik\">@elf Pavlik</a>\u00a0is right from his perspective \u2013 but you, Elf, are one of the strongest, most resilient people I have ever met. You don't mind being alone doing good work \u2013 if you do good work, people will come to you, as it happened time and again. Most people, however, need the more or less continued hum of human activity to keep them going. In this phase, I think most unMonastery group will consist of lone individuals who would like to start an unMonastery \u2013 and almost none will be as autonomous as Elf. They will benefit from hanging out with the Matera unBrethren, they will feel less lonely.\u00a0\n\nRiccardo, am I correct? You are of course welcome to start a separate unMonastery Bergamo project because who does the work calls the shots. But you are also welcome in this space, as far as I am concerned.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-24 17:22:46", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:44.308873", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 395, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [29615], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24040, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 4792, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Comms/ media partners</b>\n\nI've used this equation for past events: get some media on board to cover the event (x amount o exposure), then go to corporates and get them onboard through various packages which include the exposure (they can stick it into their marketing budget).\n\n", "created_at": "2015-09-10 13:23:43", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:13.262088", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 51, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 61855, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 10731, "post_number": 18, "raw": "can you link the main post?", "created_at": "2019-10-21 15:28:21.562287", "updated_at": "2019-10-21 15:28:21.562287", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 6, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 23.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [61399], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60843, "user_id": 4640, "topic_id": 8582, "post_number": 79, "raw": "Good list.

What you are saying actually is indeed the fact that there needs to be value creation for social purpose driven initiatives.\n\nFor it to be value driven, there need to be people that are ready to pay for the service.\n\nThe whole concept of testing with a Minimum viable product (MVP) or Minimum viable Offer (MVO) it's the ideas behind the lean startup philosophy.\n\nTest something from users, learn how to identify their needs (because they do not always express them directly) and how to create something that satisfies their needs creating enough value for them to really use your product/service. Etc.\n\nI believe there is much to learn from the whole lean startup philosophy for people that want to change the way our world is driven. This is why we were organizing workshops on lean startup and collaborative business modeling (as the one organized in Stockholm). However, there are also limits of the lean startup principles. For example with Babele, we received the true validation of the concept only in October 2014, so 1 year and 2 months after having launched the platform. And we started selling services with the platform only in February 2015 (so 1 year and almost 6 months after). It takes a lot of patience in building professional products and services, and sometimes the lean startup philosophy invites people to give up too soon because they were not able to receive proper validation soon enough...\n\n", "created_at": "2015-03-03 13:48:03", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:31.314898", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 265, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [514], "is_private": false}, {"id": 77422, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 13554, "post_number": 6, "raw": "Ok, guys.

With the air and water around the tropical Atlantic rising quickly, hurricanes like Dorian which hit the Bahamas just last week, will develop and grow stronger more quickly and carry more rain as they move.\n\nWe don&rsquo;t have the luxury to sit around any longer and hope it&rsquo;ll be ok: climate change is here.\n\nAround 10% of the world&rsquo;s total [electricity is consumed by the internet](https://edgeryders.eu/t/how-can-the-internet-help-the-climate/9856/12), and training a deep learning algorithm produces the equivalent of 626,000 pounds of carbon dioxide \u2014[ nearly five times as much as the lifetime emissions of the average American car](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613630/training-a-single-ai-model-can-emit-as-much-carbon-as-five-cars-in-their-lifetimes/), including the manufacturing process.\n\nAnd then there&rsquo;s a strong trend to push electricity consumption onto the internet where energy costs are less transparent. Cutting travelling and moving to zoom isn&rsquo;t as environmentally friendly as we think it is ([the internet currently consumes as much energy as the airline industry](https://edgeryders.eu/t/what-do-troll-factories-have-to-do-with-the-5g-scare/10059/7)).\n\nWhat this means: we have different layers that all affect our climate, and tech is one of these layers.\n\n## What we do in the next 50 years will have an impact on the next 10,000 years.\n\nTo move away from the path that we are on, and move towards a stable and resilient planet, we need to reduce our carbon emissions significantly and find a way how we can live happy, healthy, and fulfilling lives.\n\nWe can only make this happen if we tackle the following all-together: technology, policy and behavioral change. Cutting carbon emissions needs businesses, governments, and people to make significant investments and coordinated efforts.\n\nA lot of different things affect each other, known and unknown. That is why we need to make substantial changes on all three fronts at the same time, and in such a way that progress in one reinforces/is aligned with progress in the other two.\n\n## From consumption, to play, to the internet\n\nAt the very least, the world needs to cut half of the carbon emissions by 2030. Although [banning plastic straws is doing very little on its own](https://edgeryders.eu/t/deep-green-internet-of-biases-and-other-terrible-ways-to-open-a-conversation/10190/10), there are several interlinked solutions to reduce carbon emissions.\n\n&ldquo;Examples include withdrawing from coastlines, shutting down vulnerable industrial facilities, or giving up expectations for certain types of consumption,&rdquo; [writes British sustainability professor Jem Bendell](https://edgeryders.eu/t/please-read-the-deep-adaptation-paper/10726).\n\n> \"_Another potentially effective tool is &ldquo;slowing down.&rdquo; For example, you can slow down carbon emissions by 20% in the shipping industry if you slow down the speed of boats by 12 Knots. And there are many more examples_\". \n\nBut not only our immediate actions matter, as Bendell writes. It is also about changing our value systems, cultural identities and routines that have changed during our carbon emission dependent capitalist society. These are a few ideas on how to make that change: &ldquo;re-wilding landscapes, so they provide more ecological benefits and require less management, changing diets back to match the seasons, rediscovering non-electronically powered forms of play, and increased community-level productivity and support.&rdquo;\n\nBut what about the tech side of it, in terms of green products \u2014 what technological development we invest in and how \u2014 or a human-centered internet which &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t make the situation worse.&rdquo; Right now, the internet is a net contributor to climate change: can the development of the Net even be considered outside of this reality?\n\nIn terms of products startups and tech companies produce, we should work on the environmental impact on both the materials side, as well as on the energy side of (digital) products.\n\n## How do we know if something has had impact?\n\nKnowing if what we do has impact is extremely difficult, [as explained here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/on-assessing-impact-and-what-edgeryders-could-do-in-that-department/10708). Especially governments are extremely eager to measure anything with so-called scalar indicators which they control, such as GDP and ROI. And this form of &ldquo;administrative ordering&rdquo; could even lead to violently changing reality, as we saw with Stalin&rsquo;s collectivization of agriculture.\n\n&ldquo;Stalin&rsquo;s collectivisation programme was terrible at growing crops. But it worked very well in appropriating crops to feed industrial cities, the base of Soviet power, and in keeping the peasantry in check. In other words, these schemes are successful parasites. Once they take hold, they are hard to kill,&rdquo; as Edgeryders Founder Alberto Cottica [writes here](http://www.cottica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/black_briefing_sgs.pdf).\n\nSo, what can be done so governments really appreciate what is going on in complex systems such as the economy or the global environment?\n\nTwo researchers, George Cowan and Brian Arthur at the Santa Fe Institute, believe that governments should mostly observe, monitor and experiment, a wise government recognises that it is part of the environment it seeks to influence.\n\n## What Edgeryders does and how you can be part of it\n\nThis is how we, at Edgeryders, are working towards it: we bring different solutions for societal problems together, through people, [social science methods and open source technologies](https://edgeryders.eu/t/about-the-software-ssna-category/147). We work with institutions to implement these solutions and we&rsquo;re in the middle of creating new places to live and work together, where everyone can develop the skills, behaviors and social norms needed for thriving in a decarbonised future.\n\nBy innovating new social science through research collaborations with leading universities, testing new methods for organising people and knowledge, and creating new technologies to transform large scale conversations into collective wisdom, we&rsquo;re working on all three layers needed to make a substantial change.\n\nAnd this is where you come in:\n\n* how would you/not approach developing a deep green trustmark for digital tech?\n* What would you try/avoid doing?\n* Who \u2014 or what \u2014 would you bring into that conversation?\n* And how would you mobilize people in tech to contribute or adopt using it?\n\nJoin this conversation [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/deep-green-internet-of-biases-and-other-terrible-ways-to-open-a-conversation/10190).

These are programs/groups which are especially active right now, and where there are tangible opportunities for people to get involved.  And it is part of our social contract with the community to get in touch and inform them about relevant new opportunities when they materials.\n\nThe Edgeryders Festival, the conversations leading up to it, are where members can quickly get a sense of what is happening right now in Edgeryders, and how they can plug into it. The process is designed to ensure everyone comes out of the festival having made meaningful connections with people who can support their professional and personal development.\n\nSo how are we going to do this? \n\n### 1. Put together a minisite for the festival that aggregates the most active discussions _(Done!)_ : \n\n* **EarthOS: Edgeryders environment and climate unit**. This is the shared workspace for the unit\u2019s projects, as well as environment- and climate-relevant discussion topics.\n\n* **Participio: A technology development lab within Edgeryders** to build experimental software and methodology for decentralized organizations and co-created culture.\n\n* **The Research Network is a business unit in the Edgeryders company**, organised as a network. After preliminary discussions with community members, we started its buildup in October 2017.\n\n* **OpenVillage: A co-creative space for P2P development of sustainable lifestyles and businesses**.We experiment with collaborative models of entrepreneurship, learning and communal spaces. In pursuit of  meaningful, productive and enjoyable living.\n\n* **Next Generation Internet:** A sensemaking and partnership-building space for people building the evolution of the Internet and our digital technologies. So that they support efforts to build a better future against a backdrop of massive social, economic, ecological and political challenges.\n\n* **Open Enquiry: Edgeryders curated collective enquiry into the big themes** such as Spiritual, Moral &amp; Psychological Wellbeing, Work and Prosperity, Health as well as Democracy, Justice and Rule of Law.\n\n### 2.  Use our tagging system to identify previous community discussions on the platform. \nThis can be done in one of two ways _(Ongoing!)_ :\n\n* Look at [What We Care About](https://edgeryders.eu/t/what-we-care-about/6978), and click on the tags to show you the archive of content relevant to your topic if interest.\n* Review some of the reports from research initiatives around topics such as Community driven [Health & Social Care](https://edgeryders.eu/t/an-ethnography-of-opencare-software-demo-and-research-results/7570), the community reports from [2018](https://www.scribd.com/document/368465650/OpenVillage-Festival-2017-how-we-can-work-together-to-reach-shared-goals) and more ([publications](https://edgeryders.eu/t/edgeryders-publications-reports-books-presentation-slides-videos-etc/10758)).\n\n### 3.  Reach out to the contributors \nGet in touch with the authors and commentators of posts you feel are especially interesting to you. Point them to the best-of content, and ongoing activities relevant to their interests on the platform more recently. Invite them to the festival and explain how they can get involved.\n\n### 4.

I guess that the news about the outbreak may have reached many of you.\n\nSince yesterday the local district (Kreis [G\u00fctersloh](https://www.kreis-guetersloh.de/aktuelles/corona/), 365.000 people, 970 km\u00b2) is closed down; that is, contact limitations are the same as they have been end March. About 700.000 people are directly concerned in two districts of the region. In the two biggest urban centres (together 150.000 inhabitants) live about 1000 infected persons (identified 23rd June). Without stretching the similarities too much; we witness an attempt to confine to a region a localised outbreak as it was tried in Lombardi some months ago.\n\nHere some features:\n\nIt is the second localised outbreak in the region that has its trigger in a meat processing plant. The difference is in the scale. The current outbreak is an order of magnitude bigger. Currently, about 1500 infected persons of a staff of 7500. The factory [in Rheda-Wiedenbr\u00fcck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheda-Wiedenbr%C3%BCck) (47.000 inhabitants) belongs to the T\u00f6nnies group, (the personal wealth of the owner family is several billion euro). Within the factory (~20% of German capacity of industrial butchery) some days ago some production lines showed three infected persons for four workers.\n\nTo handle regional outbreaks the Governments of the German L\u00e4nder and the Federal State did agree that \u2018regional contact restrictions etc.\u2019 are needed if the (official) number of infected people are bigger than 50 cases during the last seven days for a population of 100.000 inhabitants; subject to the feature that the outbreak is not highly localised. The political debate of the last days was about whether the outbreak is local.\n\nThe outbreak got suspected at 16th June. Measures corresponding to a \u2018regional outbreak\u2019 were taken at 23rd June. The regional season for the summer holidays starts next week with the regular summer breaks of schools. Currently, there is no ban on travel outward from the district although some German regions have issued bans for holiday seekers coming from the two local district in Germany (for example, identifiable by the plate of their car) that do not test negative (free testing is offered). Within the next days we will learn about local, regional, or over-spilling character of the outbreak.\n\nAmong the socio-economic features of the local outbreak are: \n\n1. highest incidence was in a production line with cold environment (4\u00b0C) and recirculated air; \n2. work force was mainly placed by external providers, who recruit people from Bulgaria, Romania and Poland; \n3. Such \u2018external staff\u2019 legally does not count as staff of the T\u00f6nnies factory and it is not subject to labour laws that apply for the factory (for example, continuation of pay if the person is ill); \n4. formally, the \u2018external provider\u2019 shall comply with German laws (time recording, etc.) and not the factory; \n5. the \u2018external staff\u2019 is highly mobile (between countries, places, production plants); \n6. the places of living (houses, flats) for the \u2018external staff\u2019 in Germany often is manged by the \u2018external providers\u2019, are used intensively, and people may not be registered at place of living; \n7. overall, the concerned factory of the T\u00f6nnies group is managed in a manner that on its premise is neither a group of a trade union nor a works council ([Betriebsrat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Works_council)); \n8. the factory targets the high-volume low-value production segment; \n9. in my town (21.000 inhabitants) live about 20 persons who work at the Tonnies factory in Rheda-Wiedenbr\u00fcck (therefore, ~65 persons are in quarantine here); \n10. the regional economic structure is shaped by (relatively) small towns with, compared to their seize, a small number of industrial plants.\n\nI leave it to you, to observe and analyse. My preliminary lesson: (i) the outbreak is home made, (ii) it is caused by the systemic socio-political features, (iii) one case more showing that lack of participatory features ease system failures (here: lack of work council)", "created_at": "2020-06-24 12:27:56.617208", "updated_at": "2020-06-24 14:46:07.484011", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 698, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 62.2, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 6455, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 37817, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 7244, "post_number": 6, "raw": "There is an old saying some of us like to ponder, \"do what you love and the money will follow.\"  And many of us have found this to be true at different times.\n\nBut what if you do something like a job that you don't hate but is not what you most want to do.

I really do like the idea and currently I'm at a place where it might fit me pretty well to join a project like this. I'm still kind of wondering whether I would be a good fit and whether I would be happy with my personal outcome.\u00a0\n\nI have two questions that perhaps could clarify this for myself and for others as well.\u00a0\n\n* What kind of skills do you think will be needed during the period you will be there?\u00a0\n\n* What kind of skills do you think you will develop / polish\u00a0as a result of participating in UnMonastery?\n\nMy preconceived ideas of what kind of skills you'll eventually develop during the UnMonastery is firstly facilitation. Since you have to cater to the community at Matera and together with them find solutions of what can be improved and how it can be improved. I'm guessing that it will involve a lot of listening and trying to figure out what are the real problems at hand. The second skill that I'm imagining you'll develop is offline community building. There will be a need to build a functioning community around the UnMonastery in Matera where people can meet each other and try overcome the challenges faced by the people there. So that would also involve community outreach, to the Matera Community at large.\u00a0\n\nMy current interests are revolving quite a lot around programming and learning to do this better as this skill both seems to be so valuable in this day and age as well it have had a personal lure for me for quite some time. I would still say that I'm pretty much a beginner in that area. But I'm picking up the skills through various MOOC and thus\u00a0self-educating that way. So in a way I'm looking for a place where I could get an opportunity to develop these skills more in-depth.\u00a0\n\nMy pre-conceived ideas of what the stay at UnMonastery would be like\u00a0doesn't really fit with what I'm looking for. At least that's how I perceive\u00a0it myself. So I'm reaching out to you to ask you what you think it will be like. What are the skills you think would be helpful and what kind of skills would you develop as a result of participating? There is always the black swan element, but it would be interesting to hear some kind of ideas around this.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-05-03 15:16:45", "updated_at": "2018-06-03 05:43:03.500652", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 455, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 58511, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 1092, "post_number": 17, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2019-08-28 09:22:10.921926", "updated_at": "2019-08-28 09:22:10.921926", "deleted_at": "2019-08-28 11:12:03.174132", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 56201, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 10282, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Sounds about right :) \n\nI was wondering how they were going to navigate having all of these different voices in one physical room with the clock ticking.

Personally I'm doubting whether @Billy_Smith is likely to feel a sense of connection from this. I think we could do better (though some people may not wish to) in hearing him. My sense is that he longs for better relations between the parties involved, and for some kind of restoration of trust; and that he cannot at present trust the people he names to behave in the way that he sees would be most beneficial in this situation. Maybe (I'm using what imagination I can to give as much slack as I can) his lack of trust here is contingent on his not fully hearing the frustration and pain that was prompted in these people by what happened, which may have led them to feel the need to be less than fully transparent in his terms, just to look after their own well being. I guess most if not all of us have been there at one time.\n\nI'm sure that we can, with a lot of empathic imagination, guess motivations for everyone's actions, as well as feelings, based on their authentic needs and values. But what I have written above are simply guesses -- it could all be a wildly inaccurate.\n\nMy intention is in no way to excuse dangerous, harmful, hurtful or inappropriate behaviour. Not at all. But if we wish to help people change their inappropriate behaviour patterns, we may find that helping them to identify and connect with their own positive needs, and seeing the inappropriate behaviour as a strategy for meeting their own needs that, sadly, did not meet other people's needs; and that they have better choices available; and that we can support their making better choices (partly through all parties learning to listen better to each other), maybe we can work towards restoration of trust?\n\nAnd I am certainly not making a judgement about whether it is possible in this case. What I am saying is that I would like to live in a society, in a culture, where this better listening and hearing is part of the abundant slack that we give each other.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-07-19 05:42:44", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:04.213130", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 402, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 3.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [33466], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60851, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 10971, "post_number": 38, "raw": "ok, scheduled for then", "created_at": "2019-10-07 19:46:07.943190", "updated_at": "2019-10-07 19:46:07.943190", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 21.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [60801], "is_liked_by": [5209], "is_private": false}, {"id": 45306, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 8705, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Agreed too.

Jain, the head of Michigan State University\u2019s Biometrics Research Group, is facing major backlash for his involvement with Chinese academics, especially since his research is used by the Chinese government for their facial recognition tech to track Uyghurs and send them to internment camps. \n\n![229|690x361](upload://aeQ10vf4h20nEdkeYoa1OqLGVcA.png) \n\nIn 2018, Jain traveled to Xinjiang\u2019s capital Urumqi to give a speech about facial recognition at the Chinese Conference on Biometrics Recognition (CCBR). Jain was also on the CCBR\u2019s advisory board and was pictured receiving an honorary certificate.\n\n> Jain is regarded as one of the world\u2019s most influential computer scientists and a pioneer in areas of pattern recognition and biometric recognition systems. He has won countless awards and honors and is often quoted on U.S. facial recognition issues in publications like Wired and Slate. In the same month as Jain presented a paper titled \u201cFrom the Edge of Biometrics: What\u2019s Next?\u201d at the CCBR conference in Urumqi, a United Nations human rights panel described Xinjiang as resembling a \u201cmassive internment camp that is shrouded in secrecy.\u201d [LINK](https://codastory.com/authoritarian-tech/influential-us-scientist-under-fire-xinjiang-links/)\n\nBiometrics have played a major role in the Chinese \u201canti-terror\u201d crackdown on its Muslim minority the Uyghurs. Thousands have been detained in so-called \"re-education camps,\" and facial recognition, DNA collection, iris scans, and more have played a major role in it.\n\n**We're talking here about a new internet, one where the internet and tech (such as in smart cities) is a tool to help us move forward. But what if the research isn't used to help us move forward, but instead is used against us?**\n\n> David Tobin, a lecturer at the University of Glasgow who studies security in China, said researchers in technical fields often ignore the real-world applications of their research. \u201cIt is imperative that natural scientists be trained in social sciences to understand these effects and the world they make things for and in ethics to be able to ask these questions when they construct, conduct, and disseminate their research,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, such training and knowledge is sadly lacking in these fields and public debates rely on false dichotomies between natural and social worlds and between facts and values.\u201d\n\n![EESuI7NXsAArtCQ|622x690](upload://2Ub9jCEVNj9ksikoui2MKYoOKQW.jpeg) \n([from a 2012 interview for Science by Mara Hvistendahl](https://twitter.com/MaraHvistendahl/status/1172253296230379522?s=20))\n\n**_I know this is a massive question, and I keep getting back to it, because I really want us to always ask this question: whatever solution we come up with \u2014 may it be [decentralized messaging apps](https://edgeryders.eu/t/decentralized-risks-hosting-information-for-others-comes-at-a-cost/9953/24), [how the internet is funded](https://edgeryders.eu/t/what-is-to-be-done-about-the-ad-based-internet-economy/9821/51), [social media moderation](https://edgeryders.eu/t/podcast-recording-of-our-community-call-with-christian-buggedei-august-6-2019/10588/4), or [smart cities](https://edgeryders.eu/t/edgeryders-internet-of-humans-fellows-interviews-and-podcasts-with-peter-bihr/10423/12) \u2014 cracks down on the manner in which these solutions could be used by \"evil forces.\"_**", "created_at": "2019-09-13 02:45:47.678026", "updated_at": "2020-12-14 19:35:03.078922", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 543, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 122.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4022], "is_private": false}, {"id": 38044, "user_id": 3367, "topic_id": 7170, "post_number": 66, "raw": "hey! i'm happy to fill in the spot for food, if it's still available (eta here, aka @nicole). especially interested in the upcooking. also happy to fill in elsewhere--wherever's needed...", "created_at": "2017-10-10 19:17:52.554739", "updated_at": "2017-10-10 19:17:52.554739", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 34, "wiki": false, "reads": 35, "score": 7.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [38013], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25463, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 519, "post_number": 9, "raw": "Guys you're really going for this, wow.\n\nIn addition to possible support from OpenCare\u00a0(for which we are just now drafting terms with Marco)\u00a0you might want to look into a uni partner that would be willing to assign students to work for it and make it part of a semester assignment, that should really help kickstart. \u00a0Of course, this may be too advanced stuff for coursework, I have no idea.\u00a0\n\nWhat's a good timeline?
