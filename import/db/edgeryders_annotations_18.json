Here's the list of must-have and nice-to-have requirements (off the top of my head, might change a bit lateron still):\n\n\n\n\nStyle: just like the video, the charme of this product is its down-to-earth simplicity and authenticity. So, no high-gloss expensive packaging of course.\n\n\nPackaging material: A brown food-grade paper bag as used for grains etc. is our preferred backaging option for now. Eco-friendly, down-to-earth and cheap. (Green coffee beans do not need anything more fancy: no vacuum packaging etc. since the coffee is not roasted yet, so no aroma to deteriorate by oxygen contact.)\n\n\nLabel: The bag would get a sticker applied to it \u2013 which would be the main part to be designed (apart from selecting the exact bag and designing ways to close it etc. of course, if you like to dive into this).\n\n\nThe \"brand\" is always the name of the farmer, as seen in the shop names on epelia.com. So we have six different brands. If the label could be made in a way that (say) 4 of them are delivered on an A4 sheet and we can print in the different \"brand names\" by running these sheets through a black-and-white laser printer, it would be perfect. Means, if all the parts that differ between different sellers are black and white, it would be perfect.\n\n\nLogos: The farmers are the ones selling this (it's \"their product\"), so both the Fairdirect and Edgeryders organizations can \"only\" appear in a supporter / enabler role on the label, not as manufacturer. For example, put both their labels somewhere with a \"Brought to you by:\" or \"Supporting organizations:\" line or similar.\n\n\nThere is a \"Product Fairness Level\" indicator that is a main part of this sales system. It's (for now) always the second product photo (for example here). That kind of thing incl. the QR code should be part of the label, but it may be redesigned.\n\n\nThe usual, legally required product information on the label is:\n\n\n\n\nContents: 500 g\n\n\nIngredients: coffee beans (unroasted)\n\n\nBest before: [some free space for printing a date with the laser printer]", "created_at": "2018-07-27 22:38:41.400764", "updated_at": "2018-07-27 22:38:41.400764", "tag_id": 3199, "post_id": 6089, "creator_id": 4155, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 6056}, {"id": 13867, "text": "", "quote": "I've just come back from 3 months in Southern Ethiopia.

So for ten people it would be about 17000 kWh per year.\n\nIf you want to produce 25% of electricity using solar panels, you'll have to make 4250 kWh per year. Then to know the quantity of solar panels to install it will depend on :\n\n\n\n\nNominal power of each solar panel : currently a 300W solar panel has a size of about 2m * 1m\n\n\nThe location (solar potential)\n\n\n\nSo for Matera with a 2.4 kW installation (eight 300W solar panels) you would produce 4690 kWh per year using solar trackers. To estimate the PV production you can use this site.\n\nOf course this is an average value for a year. During the the winter it will be significantly less so you'll have to adjust according to the season.\n\nSo to evaluate the costs of such an installation you'll have to consider other things :\n\n\n\n\nThe cost of a solar panel will mainly depend on the power it can produce (if you have space you can imagine using less powerful solar panels, which are cheaper).

The proposal is a DIY microwave vacuum dryer that consumes excess photovoltaics energy and excess heat. This is not freeze drying, because the product is never frozen (thereby also preventing damage through freezing). Instead, the phase change will always be between liquid and vapor, but accelerated greatly by vacuum and microwaves, which makes the processing times so short that the above-ambient temperatures do not damage or microbioloically spoil the products.\n\nProcess requirements. The process is commercially developed by (for example) EnWave, calling it the \"nutraRev\" process (see also their Fact Sheet). According to these sources, the process can use an input temperature of 37 \u00b0C even for meat products. Which seems to mean, the 37 \u00b0C can be applied as thermal energy, and additional energy is applied via microwaves. So the process works at all pressures where water boils at 37 \u00b0C or below. Which means about 6000 Pa according to the phase diagram of water.\n\nParts to use. These low vacuum requirements are good news, as it allows to use a recovered standard fridge compressor as the vacuum pump, which can achieve pressures down to about 1500 Pa (as demonstrated in this video by boiling water at 15 \u00b0C). It is also (probably) possible to combine two such compressors in series to achieve a better vacuum. Finally, DIY building of a vacuum chamber from a kitchen dish, plus suction hoses, is explained in another video, \"How to Make a Freeze Dryer\". The last part is getting the moisture out of the vacuum \u2013 either by just using the vacuum pump (if it does not get damaged that way) or by using a condenser as in freeze dryers: a cold surface to remove the moisture by freezing it, possibly provided with a small Peltier element. In freeze dryers, this surface is usually -50 \u00b0C, while in our case (due to the less perfect vacuum), -10 \u00b0C to -20 \u00b0C would be enough. In addition, we will need a microwave oven; the cheapest solution is a thrown-out AC grid microwave.

So one would place a dish of food under a vacuum bowl (normal kitchen glas bowl) into the microwave, extract the air, and apply microwaves. The process duration would depend on available excess photovoltaic energy, but under optimum conditions would be 20 min to 2 hours (as specified for the EnWave nutraRev system).\n\nEnergy costs. Energy costs are 0.23 USD per kg of dried berries for nutraRev, which at about 0.12 USD/kWh U.S. electricity costs maps to 2 kWh / kg of dried berries. Now berries (blueberries in this example) have a 85% water content, meaning the energy need is 2 kWh / (1 kg / 0.15) = 0.3 kWh / kg of fresh blueberries.\n\n\u00a0 So for comparison: If you have a 8 m\u00b2 photovoltaics off-grid plant plant, that's about\u00a01000 W(p), and maps to at least 3 kWh \"freely available\" excess energy per day in summer, which you just don't need for normal living. You can dry 10 kg of fruits per day with this. Or probably 20 kg, by also using thermal solar input energy compared to the all-electric energy used in the EnWave process.

The proposal is a DIY microwave vacuum dryer that consumes excess photovoltaics energy and excess heat. This is not freeze drying, because the product is never frozen (thereby also preventing damage through freezing). Instead, the phase change will always be between liquid and vapor, but accelerated greatly by vacuum and microwaves, which makes the processing times so short that the above-ambient temperatures do not damage or microbioloically spoil the products.\n\nProcess requirements. The process is commercially developed by (for example) EnWave, calling it the \"nutraRev\" process (see also their Fact Sheet). According to these sources, the process can use an input temperature of 37 \u00b0C even for meat products. Which seems to mean, the 37 \u00b0C can be applied as thermal energy, and additional energy is applied via microwaves. So the process works at all pressures where water boils at 37 \u00b0C or below. Which means about 6000 Pa according to the phase diagram of water.\n\nParts to use. These low vacuum requirements are good news, as it allows to use a recovered standard fridge compressor as the vacuum pump, which can achieve pressures down to about 1500 Pa (as demonstrated in this video by boiling water at 15 \u00b0C). It is also (probably) possible to combine two such compressors in series to achieve a better vacuum. Finally, DIY building of a vacuum chamber from a kitchen dish, plus suction hoses, is explained in another video, \"How to Make a Freeze Dryer\". The last part is getting the moisture out of the vacuum \u2013 either by just using the vacuum pump (if it does not get damaged that way) or by using a condenser as in freeze dryers: a cold surface to remove the moisture by freezing it, possibly provided with a small Peltier element. In freeze dryers, this surface is usually -50 \u00b0C, while in our case (due to the less perfect vacuum), -10 \u00b0C to -20 \u00b0C would be enough. In addition, we will need a microwave oven; the cheapest solution is a thrown-out AC grid microwave. Solar thermal input (at about 40 \u00b0C) is also good, as it reduces the amount of microwave energy needed.\n\nOperation.

By being able to easily store and trade ones produce, food self-supply in a community context is much more feasible.\n\n\n\nIt makes food a kind of currency. The ability to store any food (even meat) safely for 25 years at room temperature while keeping it nutritious and tasty transforms food from something to get rid of before it spoils to a currency-like asset that can be re-traded in subsequent barter deals. Much more so, because dried food is 50-90% lighter than the original, making it economically transportable even by parcel shipment.\n\n\n\nIt solves temporary oversupply of food, and food-waste. Dumpster diving or foodsharing often leads to local oversupplies of food. While these can still be managed with just-in-time sharing, gleening (like via mundraub.org) leads to huge oversupplies during harvest time.

But just as we have argued that there is a misallocation in our society of wealth and correspondingly housing and food, and similarly a misallocation of reputation and recognition, so I would argue there is a misallocation of meaning. Work and success with work is consistently taken as providing meaning; or worse still the act of consumption. We have been trained in our society to identify meaning with the acquisition of objects whether the right car, the latest style of handbag or the most fashionable pair of trainers. We must not forget that this is still the vector for access to meaning for a vast proportion of the population.\n\nBoth psychological studies and centuries of spiritual teachings have tried again and again to persuade us that real meaning lies in what is least regarded today. These include caring for others, both loved ones and those less fortunate than ourselves, paying attention to the small acts and rituals of daily life, preparing and sharing a meal with friends. What is interesting is the consistency in the message from all the different spiritual traditions and equally the self-help books.\n\nThe misallocation of meaning is profound in its impacts and in providing a driving force to many of the problematic activities and behaviours around us. It would be absurd or presumptuous to ask for a different view on the allocation of meaning. There are plenty enough available. What is needed perhaps is mechanisms for the greater adoption and spread of such meaning allocations. Currently we are failing collectively in this area, and this is largely due to the over dominance of \"paying the rent\" and the \"the eyes of others\" as criteria in people's lives.

We\u2019re flattering ourselves by believing that their existence was so grim and that our modern, civilized one is, by comparison, so great. Still, we are where we are, and we live the way we live, and it\u2019s possible to wonder whether any of this illuminating knowledge about our hunter-gatherer ancestors can be useful to us. Suzman wonders the same thing. He discusses John Maynard Keynes\u2019s famous 1930 essay \u201cThe Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren.\u201d Keynes speculated that if the world continued to get richer we would naturally end up enjoying a high standard of living while doing much less work. He thought that \u201cthe economic problem\u201d of having enough to live on would be solved, and \u201cthe struggle for subsistence\u201d would be over:\n\n'When the accumulation of wealth is no longer of high social importance, there will be great changes in the code of morals. We shall be able to rid ourselves of many of the pseudo-moral principles which have hag-ridden us for two hundred years, by which we have exalted some of the most distasteful of human qualities into the position of the highest virtues. We shall be able to afford to dare to assess the money-motive at its true value. The love of money as a possession\u2014as distinguished from the love of money as a means to the enjoyments and realities of life\u2014will be recognized for what it is, a somewhat disgusting morbidity, one of those semi-criminal, semi-pathological propensities which one hands over with a shudder to the specialists in mental disease.'\n\nThe world has indeed got richer, but any such shift in morals and values is hard to detect. Money and the value system around its acquisition are fully intact. Greed is still good.The study of hunter-gatherers, who live for the day and do not accumulate surpluses, shows that humanity can live more or less as Keynes suggests. It\u2019s just that we\u2019re choosing not to. A key to that lost or forsworn ability, Suzman suggests, lies in the ferocious egalitarianism of hunter-gatherers. For example, the most valuable thing a hunter can do is come back with meat. Unlike gathered plants, whose proceeds are \u201cnot subject to any strict conventions on sharing,\u201d hunted meat is very carefully distributed according to protocol, and the people who eat the meat that is given to them go to great trouble to be rude about it. This ritual is called \u201cinsulting the meat,\u201d and it is designed to make sure the hunter doesn\u2019t get above himself and start thinking that he\u2019s better than anyone else. \u201cWhen a young man kills much meat,\u201d a Bushman told the anthropologist Richard B. Lee, \u201che comes to think of himself as a chief or a big man, and he thinks of the rest of us as his servants or inferiors. . . . We can\u2019t accept this.\u201d The insults are designed to \u201ccool his heart and make him gentle.\u201d For these hunter-gatherers, Suzman writes, \u201cthe sum of individual self-interest and the jealousy that policed it was a fiercely egalitarian society where profitable exchange, hierarchy, and significant material inequality were not tolerated.\u201d\n\nThis egalitarian impulse, Suzman suggests, is central to the hunter-gatherer\u2019s ability to live a life that is, on its own terms, affluent, but without abundance, without excess, and without competitive acquisition. The secret ingredient seems to be the positive harnessing of the general human impulse to envy.
