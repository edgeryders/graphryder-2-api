I have started that community and all the FB pages in most of the cities of the country, i have learned how you can plant a seed and make it grow, together we managed to change the laws for cyclists and pedestrians and most of it has started thanks to my ability to communicate well through design and constantly explaining the concept of critical mass to the point that people feel somewhat empowered enough so that they can actually change the paradigms that we live in by becoming a big mass. Before this movement i can affirm that almost No one considered the bicycle as a means for urban transport. The best part for me in this experiment is to manage to not make myself indispensable, the flat structure allowed other leaders to take charge and continue to roll the wheel under their criteria, you can look at the photos and observe how people started to design the graphics for better or worst.

I am a part of the team of the Worldbuilding Academy, and I like the keep the communities connected as best I can.\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/how-to-build-a-world-a-webinar-with-the-worldbuilding-academys-core-team/14773\n\n> A while back, we at the Sci-Fi Economics Lab had a new idea: instead of writing academic papers, we could channel out-of-the box economic thinking around building a fictional world, to serve as the backdrop for works of science fiction or fantasy. In retrospect, it seems obvious: after all, this space exists because a small patrol of economically inclined sci-fi authors invested a lot of time and brainpower into dreaming up [exotic economic systems](https://edgeryders.eu/t/econ-sf-a-selection-of-works-and-authors/8582). But we added a couple of extra ideas to that original insight.\n> \n> First,  **we decided to build the world in a participatory way.**  We want anyone to be free to contribute ideas, analysis, references, visuals, and so on. Would technologies of great power (like  *Star Trek* \u2019s replicators) be compatible with a market economy as we know, based on scarcity? How would slower-than-light interstellar trade work? (Nobel laureate Paul Krugman actually [worked that one out ](https://www.princeton.edu/~pkrugman/interstellar.pdf)) How can  *Harry Potter* \u2019s Wizarding world use precious metal as a currency, given that wizards can simply magick out more of it and cause hyperinflation? No matter how smart, an individual author can not keep track of all the possible variables and their permutations. So, we are going to do that as a community. It just makes sense. There are already over 150 people posting on this forum, many of us professional economists.  **We are licensing the world with an open source license** : you can use it for your novel, film or game, and no lawyer will ever come calling if you make it big.\n> \n> **Second, we decided we want a world that contains several economic systems, not just one** . Again, this is an old trick in sci-fi: Anarres and Urras in Ursula K. Le Guin  *The Dispossessed* , the Hives in Ada Palmer\u2019s  *Terra Ignota* , the Acquis and the Dispensation in Bruce Sterling\u2019s  *The Caryatids* , and so on. This plurality creates a nice narrative tension, as characters can move across places and experience different economies. Also, readers tend to start thinking which economic system they would choose, if they were free to do so. For example, [this poll ](https://www.poll-maker.com/poll1009893xa10948B5-42) about \u201cwhich Terra Ignota Hive would you choose\u201d is popular on the Internet ([explanation of the Hives ](https://www.tor.com/2017/03/13/writing-a-future-in-which-you-choose-your-own-nation/)).\n> \n> But participatory projects work best if someone makes an initial investment in them. Participating in filling an empty space can be intimidating, or simply not that much fun. So,  **third, we decided to [offer a writers\u2019 residency](https://edgeryders.eu/t/writers-residency-come-lead-the-worldbuilding-academy/14502) to someone to lead the charge** . The residency is generously funded by Fondazione di Comunit\u00e0 Messina, the people with [one of the weirdest, most fascinating real-life economic models ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/8-9-scifi-economics-lab-2-the-strange-economy-of-messina/13966) we have found so far. Among the applications who flowed in, many stood out; but in the end, the strongest one came from [Yudhanjaya Wijeratne ](https://yudhanjaya.com/), a Nebula-nominated author from Sri Lanka and a member of our community (as @yudhanjaya). His novel  *Numbercaste*  has been on our [wiki of economic sci-fi ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/8582) since the beginning.\n> \n> Yudhanjaya pointed out that, in order to bring the world to a level of maturity where contributing to it is fun and interesting,  **a small team is better than one person. So, fourth, we decided to create one** . The other team members are [Joriam Ramos ](https://joriamramoscv.webflow.io/) (here as @Joriam), a Brazilian author and designer affiliated to [Enspiral ](https://enspiral.com/); [Michela De Domenico ](https://unime.academia.edu/MichelaDomenico) and [Marco Lo Curzio ](http://www.accademiadicatania.com/docenti/MarcoLoCurzio), Italian architects and illustrators; and [yours truly ](https://www.cottica.net/), as the resident economist. If you want to volunteer for the core group, just let me know with a comment or a DM.\n> \n> This group has the task to prepare, and pre-populate an online space where we all can contribute to build an open source. We are preparing a webinar which will be held Monday, 7 December at 17.00 CET, to present our concept and initial thoughts, and seek feedback from the community.\n> \n> ### To register, [go here ](https://tell.edgeryders.eu/14783).", "created_at": "2020-11-20 01:24:00.532401", "updated_at": "2020-11-20 01:24:36.787730", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 817, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 72.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 384], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5787, "user_id": 67, "topic_id": 180, "post_number": 51, "raw": "There is a laptop lying in one of the drawers in the Laser-container.

With a nice technique that @owen thought up during the Participio hackathon in Medenine, I have integrated the website closely to the Discourse. In fact, most of the text on the website is from the platform. Chunks of text that don't fit well as platform posts are lifted from unlisted posts, but some pieces of content work well both on the platform and on the website, [like the presentations](https://blivande-site.herokuapp.com/members).\n\nTo do soon:\n\n* [x] Fix profile photo caching issue\n* [x] Integrate a calendar function to book 30 minute introduction meetings, probably using [Calendly](https://calendly.com/).\n* [x] Hook up the DNS to blivande.com\n* [x] Create a contact form instead of the annoying email link\n* [x] Link Node, Edgeryders to respective websites\n* [x] Remove WE ARE BLIVANDE\n\nTo do later:\n\n* [ ] Create a sort of blog syndication feature, where topics tagged with #blivandeblog are listed on the front page, and also available to view straight on the website, with a button link to go to the forum to discuss. This will be a nice feature for members to be able to promote events, art and work and creates a nice link between the platform and the website.\n* [ ] Give all users that have a blivande-presentation tagged topic a personal profile page with their presentation  where all the topics they have posted with the blivande-blog tag are listed in a nice way.\n* [ ] Create a page for Blivande Events\n\nPing @nadia, @noemi, @johncoate, @alberto, @matthias  and @natalia_skoczylas  \u2013 presenting platform content on a website  might be an interesting trick in the toolbox for outreach and engagement.\n\nFor @matthias, in case you'd worry about load, I won't be querying the platform directly from the browser, though right now I am getting some user profile pictures. Rather, the relevant content is being cached by a microservice API (not stored in a database, just temporarily stored in memory). I will store a small thumbnail of the user pictures though to make the loading of the front page faster. You can [see the code here](https://github.com/Edgeryders-Participio/tiny-participio-api/blob/master/app.py) if you're curious. Since I want users to be completely in control of if they or their content is shown on the website, and I also don't want to store too much content in a database, I do a dumb reload of the relevant data once per minute to make the website reasonably responsive to changes. It's pretty rudimentary and primitive stuff, with a bunch of hard-coding, but it works.\n\nAlso @matthias, when you migrate us to a Communities platform, I will have to fix some stuff like changing the root url and also adding the new topic ids and category urls to the API.

Politically, culturally and theoretically, it is impossible today to navigate through the dense lattice of emergencies and urgencies without addressing the question of what constitutes the human, inhuman, subhuman and non-human, as well as formulating an adequate response to the anthropocenic threat posed by the human against the planet.\n\nHistorically, the category \u2018human\u2019 has been instrumental to the justification and practice of sovereignty and universalism in the Western world, insofar as delimiting and differentiating what \u2018human\u2019 means has been central to the project of modernity.\n\nSuch delineations have centered on questions of self-consciousness and language, intellectual ability in the form of abstract thought, the possession of a soul, tool-making capabilities, genetic inheritance or private property; however, they have demanded demarcations through the production of prohibition and hierarchization, in processes of inevitable social, political, legal, and economic violence.\n\nDrawing on a broad interdisciplinary network of critical, creative, and pedagogical communities, PARSE seeks to stimulate exchange and dialogue about how to reimagine, remake, expose and expand the human vis-\u00e0-vis notions of the nonhuman, inhuman, subhuman, posthuman and inhumane. How can we rethink the conditions for a political imaginary capable of structural transformation and justice for human and nonhuman alike? What is at the heart of current debates on the human? What political imaginaries have enabled the current wave of xenophobic and neo-colonial dehumanization? How can the arts respond to what may be termed a crisis in humanity?\n\nThe main theme of the 3rd Biennial PARSE Research Conference 2019, Human, will be organised around 6 streams that will identify clusters for thinking about the human and its discontents. PARSE particularly welcomes proposals for papers on any subject within the traditions of art, design, craft, theatre, music, photography, film, literature, and arts education, including those disciplines from social science and the humanities that are operative within the arts.\n\nPARSE welcomes doctoral student submissions, which will be presented in a session dedicated to ongoing doctoral research projects. When submitting please indicate if your submission should be considered for this session.\n\nWe welcome contributions that engage with the following topics:\n\n* the inhuman, the subhuman, the body and inscriptions of the human (the contested universality of the human across the divisions of class, race, gender, trans, queer, ableism, neurodiversity)\n\n* the imperiled non-human (the Anthropocene, nature, ecological catastrophe) and the technological non-human and objecthood (tools, machine, nature, world of objects, OOO, robotics, algorithms etc)\n\n* the posthuman, pedagogy and the institution (anti-humanism, anti-anthropocentrism, critique of the humanities, the human produced by the university, knowledge and distinction, disciplines of the human)\n\n* human mobility and nationhood (transnationalism, cosmopolitanism, migration, human rights, personhood)\n\n* biopolitics, necropolitics and the governance of the category of the human\n\n* decoloniality, post- and neo-colonialism (slavery, indigeneity, empire, desegregation, white Suprematism, white privilege) \"\n\nMaybe some projects that are in development now could also be presented there in some form, 300 words abstract and if applicable images and technical requirements for application.\n\n:slight_smile:", "created_at": "2019-02-28 16:36:49.498338", "updated_at": "2019-02-28 16:39:25.686535", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 613, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 81.8, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [9, 4, 42], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1610, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 249, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Moving this to public group for now.", "created_at": "2019-10-16 19:24:36.234403", "updated_at": "2019-10-16 19:24:36.234403", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 7, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1613, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 280, "post_number": 14, "raw": "Moving this to public group for now.", "created_at": "2019-10-16 19:27:32.150677", "updated_at": "2019-10-16 19:27:32.150677", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 7, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1612, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 281, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Moving this to public group for now.", "created_at": "2019-10-16 19:26:47.568345", "updated_at": "2019-10-16 19:26:47.568345", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 7, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 390, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 44, "post_number": 15, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2019-03-07 19:09:42.963013", "updated_at": "2019-03-07 19:28:41.136093", "deleted_at": "2019-03-08 19:44:42.564005", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5631, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1130, "post_number": 16, "raw": "For WIP this Friday, what's the plan with integrating with [Mondo Village](https://www.facebook.com/events/268615050869644/)?

They have developed 11 principles for placemaking. I copied these from the [Placemaking Chicago](http://placemakingchicago.com/about/principles.asp) website. How do they land for you? How do these principles overlap with our vision for [Frihamnstorget](https://forum.blivande.com/t/frihamnstorget-what-is-it-and-how-to-get-involved/406?u=hugi)? \n\nI think there is a lot here that also overlaps with The Node and Blivande in general. What are your thoughts?\n\n> ## 1. The community is the expert.\n> \n> People who use a public space regularly provide the most valuable perspective and insights into how the area functions. They also can help identify issues that are important to consider in improving the space. Uncovering and incorporating their ideas and talents is essential to creating a successful and vital community place.\n> \n> ## 2. You are creating a place, not a design.\n> \n> Design is an important component of creating a place, but not the only factor. Providing access and creating active uses, economic opportunities, and programming are often more important than design.\n> \n> ## 3. You can't do it alone.\n> \n> A good public space requires partners who contribute innovative ideas, financial or political support, and help plan activities. Partners also can also broaden the impact of a civic space by coordinating schedules for programming and improvement projects.\n> \n> ## 4. They'll always say, \"It can't be done.\"\n> \n> Every community has naysayers. When an idea stretches beyond the reach of an organization or its jurisdiction and an official says, \"It can't be done,\" it usually means: \"We've never done things that way before.\" Keep pushing. Identify leaders in the community who share your vision and build support. Talk to your alderman and get him or her engaged.\n> \n> ## 5. You can see a lot just by observing.\n> \n> People will often go to extraordinary lengths to adapt a place to suit their needs. A raised curb can be used as a place to sit, sort mail, and even\u2014believe it or not\u2014cook clams. Observing a space allows you to learn how the space is used.\n> \n> ## 6. Develop a vision.\n> \n> A vision for a public space addresses its character, activities, uses, and meaning in the community. This vision should be defined by the people who live or work in or near the space.\n> \n> ## 7. Form supports function.\n> \n> Too often, people think about how they will use a space only after it is built. Keeping in mind active uses when designing or rehabilitating a space can lower costs by discouraging unnecessary and expensive landscaping and monuments, as well as potentially eliminating the need to retrofit a poorly used public space.\n> \n> ## 8. Triangulate.\n> \n> The concept of triangulation relates to locating elements next to each other in a way that fosters activity. For example, a bench, trash receptacle, and coffee kiosk placed near a bus stop create synergy because they are more convenient for waiting bus passengers and pedestrians than if they were isolated from each other.\n> \n> ## 9. Start with the petunias.\n> \n> Simple, short-term actions such as planting flowers can be a way of testing ideas and encouraging people their ideas matter. These actions provide flexibility to expand the space by experimenting, evaluating and incorporating results into the next steps and longrange planning.\n> \n> ## 10. Money is not the issue.\n> \n> A lack of money is often used as an excuse for doing nothing. Funds for pure public space improvements often are scarce, so it is important to remember the value of the public space itself to potential partners and search for creative solutions. The location, level of activity, and visibility of public spaces\u2014combined with a willingness to work closely with local partners\u2014can elicit resources from those involved to activate and enhance these spaces.\n> \n> ## 11. You are never finished.\n> \n> About 80 percent of the success of any public space can be attributed to its management.

It is not just a place for culture and art but is itself a beautiful and exciting work of art. Frihamnstoget questions established principles of city planning and placemaking in Sweden today, and we are tilling the earth for the creativity of its members.\n\nFrihamnstorget is a work of art with no single vision. It is co-created by the initiatives and creativity of the different people and organizations involved. This process of co-creating a public place through citizen initiative is itself a work of art and an experiment in democracy and creativity. It should feel like a tiny container village, full of art and culture, but also workshops for craftspeople, creative businesses, food, and drink. \n\nFrihamnstorget and Blivande should also be a foundation for community-run and community-owned businesses, creating an opportunity for people to create good lives for themselves and others.\n\n## Getting involved\n\nMost people involved in Frihamnstorget are members of Blivande or The Node. We are in this together, so start by joining the community. It will become a lot easier for you to gain momentum for your initiatives once you make friends and get to know the community. Introduce yourself in a new thread, let us know who you are and what you desire!\n\nA growing number of creative and talented people have gathered around Frihamnstorget. Currently, most aspects of Frihamnstorget are open to your initiative, granted that you have the skills required and are willing to put in the work to make things happen. As we move forward, we will settle into roles and responsibilities, but we want to avoid a traditional hierarchical organization. Frihamnstorget should be a place for experimentation and citizen initiative, where its members have the power to act to improve it.\n\nThere are many opportunities for you to get involved. One good place to start is to post in the forum, and we will connect you to the people you should talk to. Things change quickly, so instead of having a traditional organization map with pictures and emails, we instead encourage you to get in touch here on the forum so that everyone gets a chance to get to know you. It saves both you and us the endless chain of introduction emails, and our conversations can be read by other people who also want to get involved. We rely on the power of the crowd to connect you. Go ahead and try it!\n\nIf you want to contribute to Frihamnstorget and have a specific idea in mind, post it in [the Frihamstorget group](https://forum.blivande.com/c/tau/frihamnstorget) on the forum. It is then up to the existing group of co-creators of Frihamnstorget and Blivande to make the decision on if we can bring your initiative to Frihamnstorget.\n\n## Support Frihamnstorget financially\n\nIf you are not directly involved in Frihamnstorget, you can still support it! Blivande is a social enterprise and a not-for-profit company, and our goal is to reinvest all profit into community initiatives and fair salaries for those working to create and run Blivande and Frihamnstorget. We still have some way to go until we cover the hosts of the house and Frihamnstorget, so a part of the plan is to find streams of income. You can support Frihamnstorget and Blivande financially in many ways, according to your own ability and ambition for this creative ecosystem. This is how:\n\n* Move your business or your art workshop to Blivande. Our memberships range from the 800 SEK per month membership in our art and crafts workshop Tau, to co-working membership at Studio Beta starting at 2500 SEK per month for a flexible desk or 3900 SEK for your own desk. Read more at [our website](https://www.blivande.com/beta) and come by for a tour.\n\n* Run events at Blivande and Frihamnstorget. Our spaces are perfect for seminars, events, and parties.  We can host up to 300 people in the house. Get in touch with @hampus or @Linnea to find out more.\n\n* Become a monthly [member of Noden](https://www.noden.community/), a non-profit association living in symbiosis with Blivande, offering daily free workshops to its members Monday to Thursday nights and on Sundays. Noden has over 300 members and is a vital part of House Blivande.\n\n* Make a donation. Would you like to see Frihamnstorget and Blivande blossom into a magnificent public place for co-created art and culture? We are open to opportunities. Would you like to create an art-fund for creators at Frihamnstorget or fund a specific work of art or improvement? Let us know! Get in touch with @hugi, @hampus or @Linnea.\n\n* Help us write grant applications. Are you a great grant application writer? We need you. Get in touch to help us out.\n\n* Run fundraising events. We would love to run more fundraising events for Frihamnstorget and Blivande, and all we're lacking is time and energy to spare.

Building this will require a substantial push. If this is something that the Borderland really wants and needs, I think it would be a good idea to use Fund 51 to pay for a one-week hackathon to build \"Things\" (similar to Dreams, Realities, Talk). \"Things\" could then connect to Dreams so that items in the library could be found and requested immediately when creating the dream. Building the alternative fund distribution algorithm for Dreams could be an additional track for the same hackathon week.\n\nMy estimate is that we could do a slightly smaller but more focused hack week as we did for Dreams in 2019. My estimate is that the cost of travel for participants, renting a location, and providing food for the week would come to around 50.000 SEK.

Finally got my act together and joined the forum. \n\nFirst off; yeah, I had a go at installing the laser cutter. Lots of bit missing, as summed up in the list in Hampus\u00b4 post above. I am sure that the Z-axis motor is not far gone, and the other bit easily replaced, EXCEPT the software dongle. This bit caused me a bit of sorrow. When the machine was still at Atelj\u00e9 Stugan this was stolen along with the laptop next to the laser. I invested time and money in getting a new one, and now this new one seems to have gone missing too. The controller card in this laser uses a specific software, Lasercut 5.3, that requires this dongle. The choice is now to either buy yet another dongle from china (1000kr, one month of waiting) or get another controller card (est. 3500kr plus a heapload of research in what model and probably quite a lot of tweaking). A new controller would then be one not requiring a dongle at all.\n\nSecond: To be weighed in the reasoning around getting the laser operational again is the estimation of how much power the old tube has left to give. It was rated at 80W when new, Given the quite hard use at Stugan towards the end I'd say we probably have 40W now. Surprisingly, a new one from China, preferably of the brand RECI, is only about 5000kr. \n\nSo, completely possible to both get needed parts and beef up the power, but will require a lot of hours of work. I can do much of it, but would love if I was accompanied by another tech wiz with some knowledge on the topic. Need to check that the power supply is compatible with the proposed cathode tube, new controller compatible with the stepper motors etc. \n\nIf we are looking at getting another laser cutter, there are a fair few choices. Getting one directly from China is by far the cheapest, but even doing research let alone getting offers thru AliExpress is opening a can of worms. There is a plethora of machines, controllers, manufacturers etc. A 120cm x 90 cm, 120W machine should cost around 60-90k kr. There are cheaper options, but you almost always end up with some drawback, like the laser power not being controlled by software, shit precision etc.\n\nAnother choice in getting a new machine is going thru the handful of Swedish companies selling china machines they imported, sometimes rebranded, and checked for quality. This would give us a warranty, some service agreement, and the possibility of a leasing deal.  I have dealt with Indukta previously, good guys and trustworthy. My assessment is that you end up paying about 110k for a machine that would have cost 60k if you imported yourself. \n\nThere are also the desktop laser segment, like the FabFactory one linked above, or the kickstarter-funded GlowForge. These are great in terms of usability and operational ease. They take little space too. Alas, if we have the kind intended use I suspect, the power and size will not be enough. I gather that there will be a lot of people not just doing small models and engravings, but more people wanting to cut crazy constructions out of plywood and acrylic.\n\nRegarding power: My experience is that more power is not always a good thing. Sure you can cut thicker material, but at the expense of precision. The 80W machine we have can do beautiful fine cuts ad dead-on precision, both mechanical and in laser power. The 150W machine from Indukta I have been using was both a bit flimsy mechanically, but foremost the laser tube would not fire under a certain power, so that fine engravings would thus suffer in detail and contrast.\n\nMy bet would be to look around for used lasers, or consider importing one from china.\n\nAlso, as a side note, I would try to steer the general use of lasercutting towards more prototyping and aesthetic projects rather than full-scale manufacture and huge projects demanding lots from the machine. For example, one can instead of making all the plywood parts for a construction by the lasercutter, instead cut a router template/jig and route the multiple pieces.", "created_at": "2019-06-25 15:54:54.285823", "updated_at": "2019-06-25 15:54:54.285823", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 715, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 29.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4921, "user_id": 34, "topic_id": 1063, "post_number": 4, "raw": "[quote=\"hampus, post:2, topic:1063\"]\nI\u2019m not aware of any preparations/roles distributed so far.

I also have some 20 beer left which is now 1 month past is date (which is fine I am sure) and would be happy to donate :).\n@NinaLindberg would you guys be interested in also doing some small weird food thing next Friday as a \"secret experience appetizer\"?", "created_at": "2020-05-22 17:36:03.728923", "updated_at": "2020-05-22 17:36:03.728923", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 156, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 96.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [4896], "is_reply_to": [4896], "is_liked_by": [4, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6829, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1443, "post_number": 2, "raw": "[quote=\"elch, post:1, topic:1443\"]\nI would make a welding course this Friday 2020/09/18\n6-10 participants\n[/quote]\n\nWhat will the focus of the course be?", "created_at": "2020-09-14 12:47:52.612481", "updated_at": "2020-09-19 12:18:01.027293", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 29, "wiki": false, "reads": 24, "score": 54.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [6828], "is_reply_to": [6828], "is_liked_by": [34], "is_private": false}, {"id": 316, "user_id": 15, "topic_id": 118, "post_number": 8, "raw": "awesomesauce! add urself to the fbook group and google doc. whatsapp group for design phase will be started once everyone is on the sheet :*", "created_at": "2019-03-01 10:11:50.471011", "updated_at": "2019-03-01 10:11:50.471011", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 24, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 7.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 439, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 94, "post_number": 15, "raw": "I'll be there as well.

We are working on individual projects but we love to start our days to talk about the status quo and ask for input if we need some which became really valuable for all of us. You find us most of the time in BETA or in TAU's electronic workshop. It's about experimenting with the daily balance and while having a lots of freedom right now we enjoy moving between these two places to keep up the flow of inspiration, community and learning. \n\n**CLAES**\n\nAfter prototyping  the concept, three areas remain central to further finishing the real installation:\n\n\u2192 Location\n\nLooking for a place that is really eerie and gives a raw and secluded feel to display the installation. I went to Skt. Eriks to look at a location underneath a bridge, the location was perfect but has now been closed off by a fence by Stockholms stad. \n\n![IMG_9054|492x500,50%](upload://dsS8fdC3UyFccyOFFY0IQBsrxwL.jpeg) \n**If you have any ideas for galleries or locations or other places that would be really great? \nFeel free to contact me on 079 069 0510** :slightly_smiling_face:\n\n\n\u2192 Sculpture\n\nSketching to find the shape that communicates that story I want to tell.\n![CleasV3|690x355](upload://bQ7IysNsRXzX7sTSKMYszv0576D.jpeg) \n\n**VICTORIA**\n\nThe pixelstick is developing and got 144 LED's which is equal 144px in the hight (the first prototype had 20). To test the ability of the pixelstick I built a box and for the tech components and a handle to keep a steady hand while drawing. I used different visuals like pictures, typography and illustration to see which style fits the pixelstick. I realized that a black background with a bright color and a simple shape works best in a medium-light environment. \nTo create such visuals, I use Photoshop with the 144px as the document size and any width which fits my idea and export it as a png. The only step left is to creating a txt file out of the png and voil\u00e1. You can print in the air. \n\nRight now me and @jonasjohansson are looking for writers, poets and typographers who wants to have their words painted with light in the streets of Stockholm for an upcoming project.\n\nIf you want to participate feel free to sign up for it.

The plan is to have an exhibition this summer in a small town - Sandviken, i.e. if things turn out to be normal again. The interactive objects will have a local connection and the audiovisual as well - I will figured out how that works together. This week I will start to build a portable construction where things can be hanging from, and be moved anywhere at any time.\n\n![94780485_906217243149294_4049771615980879872_n|375x500](upload://33dmfrKdcLbJhDyjPHSxLwZj0D3.jpeg)", "created_at": "2020-04-27 14:58:06.855850", "updated_at": "2020-04-27 15:18:30.780772", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 530, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 267.4, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 13, 215, 24, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5894, "user_id": 34, "topic_id": 1239, "post_number": 3, "raw": "[quote=\"SebastianStlind, post:1, topic:1239\"]\nIs there a container we could evacuate on Work is Play on July 24th to bring our PA system for some testing?\n[/quote]\n\n@cecilia_ulfsdotter, the yellow container is beeing emptied for your exhibition in august, correct?

Do you remember a good example of remote collaboration you had in the past?**\n\n-Karl: A music video production meeting I had earlier this week. I realized the importance of having a leader with the ability to structure the meeting properly.\n\n-Saga: When you work globally it is a better alternative than just a phone call. Now with drive and similar platforms you can work together although you\u2019ve never met.\n\n**2. Propose 1-3 guidelines for regular check-in culture.**\n\n* Make sure that the check-ins provide value for everyone involved.\n* A check-in should be an arena to update other group members on any hardships a given group member may need help to overcome.\n* Check-ins should be concise, in order to not waste time.\n\n**3. Propose 1-3 guidelines for online calls.**\n\n-A routine for determining who should speak. In larger meetings, this could be done via a chat and a moderator. In smaller meetings, hand-raising can work.\n\n-A common agreement to not use other phones or computers during the meeting, save for taking notes.\n\n-Having one's camera turned on whenever possible. During an online call, exaggerating your usual body language can help compensating an otherwise flat impression. Use gestures, nods, facial expressions, but no sound unless the group is very small.\n\n**4. Propose 1-3 platforms you would like to use for different types of asynchronous collaboration.**\n\n* Google Drive. Useful when several people need to edit the same text repeatedly.\n* Slack.\n* Basecamp.\n\n**5. Propose a creative remote social interaction.**\n\n* The participants could take turns showing the others around in their homes. That way one makes use of the fact that everyone is filming themselves at home. Thus, something that previously might have made it harder for the participants to get to know each other, lets the participants see a side of each other that they might not have seen otherwise.\n* When one take a break during the meeting, everyone can decide to sit in front of the computer while they drink their coffee or tea. During the break they can talk about things unrelated to the meeting, and as a result they get the opportunity to get to know each other in the same way that they would have during a normal meeting.\n* There are a lot of cheap multiplayer online games that the participants could play together during a break or after the meeting is over. Thus, they get a chance to enjoy themselves and get to know each other. Asynchronous platforms such as Discord makes it easy for players to talk to each other whilst playing the same game.\n\n**6. Are there any additional guidelines or recommendations you would like to add?**\n\n-", "created_at": "2020-09-24 08:15:45.288676", "updated_at": "2020-09-24 08:15:45.288676", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 467, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 48.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [34], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7215, "user_id": 49, "topic_id": 1474, "post_number": 15, "raw": "Great Emanu!

Whatever we dream of and can make happen together and/or with others!\n\nBut... as it stands right now the only thing currently scheduled for this whole summer season is a project Joannis, Ben and I are planning which is called Output Festival. A one day minimal techno festival featuring some international artists. Basically a daytime party at FT followed by a full night party indoors at Blivande. It will go down on July 11th, so just before BL. Simon, Frida and Maria are already involved and hopefully more of you will decide to join in as well! A great topic for another discussion...\n\nThe thing I want to discuss here and now is how we can make sure to get off to a flying start at Frihamnstorget with plenty of things happening all through the spring and summer. And how to do so without breaking ourselves from sheer exhaustion and over-commitment. \n\nI don't have the answer to these questions, and I never will. It simply requires many more minds and bodies than I possess. Hence the need to gather up and start talking. We need (I believe) some kind of call to action for Frihamnstorget as it stands today. \n\n\nWe need to find and connect with people, groups, companies and organizations that want to make use of it for a day or a week, whatever, with us as caretakers, gatekeepers, curators and enablers of the whole shabang. And we should start this process sooner rather than later. I suggest a sort of \"town meeting\" for Frihamnstorget, hosted at Blivande, no later than a month from now, so mid March.\n\nOr what do you think folks? \n\n@Simon @Frida_Simon @Lekonst @bobspeakman @nina @elch @jakobskote @hanakin @Thedodod @guff @jonasjohansson @jonas @MariaMartin @MariaEuler @IdaMaria @Vinnss @Ollxor @Jomi @AmandusLeonidas", "created_at": "2020-02-12 20:23:48.432910", "updated_at": "2020-02-14 10:01:45.048453", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 349, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 73.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 118], "is_private": false}, {"id": 821, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 138, "post_number": 61, "raw": "No need to take out vacation of course!

Both are desperately needed all over Sweden, both within healthcare but also nursing homes for our elderly (the primary risk group). Just yesterday reports came out that a third of all nursing homes in Stockholm have confirmed COVID19 cases and there many different reports about the almost complete lack of protective gear for the workers at these institutions. \n\nI have also been in touch with hospitals in Tanzania, Uganda and Malawi that are of course in even more dire situations (or will be when the spread starts to pick up speed there). Reports from Malawi confirm that they don't even have access to basic soap in the hospital, let alone any protective gear. It's important that we don't forget about these places and people just because we are ourselves also in a crisis. Here the primary focus will be to help them get started with their own production and means to do so (machines, tools, material and knowledge). We will also activate our 3D printers and laser cutters to make visors for them.\n\n We are ready to launch all this **TOMORROW FRIDAY** and all we need now is **YOU!** \nAnyone healthy (*very important!*) and with time and energy to spare is warmly invited to join in on the effort!\n\nWe will organize ourselves in teams and I have created a [6 hour shift system WITH A SCOREBOARD](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BH3mfZ5PuCcqkmFqgyqTr7qwga3gPC86bl0LpBFMxu4/edit?usp=sharing)! \n\nMay the team with the highest score of Kudos win eternal glory (and the *SECRET* prize)!\n\n![image|375x500](upload://h5FsmZCw1kyFTCfQPlyLWLS73cz.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://tjHzZeoarkrjaGVBmT1yI4d532V.jpeg) ![image|280x500](upload://cyfgM1e9dIJYLPLgrsFpwWeilyu.jpeg)", "created_at": "2020-04-02 18:51:14.897978", "updated_at": "2020-04-05 00:47:07.257515", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 357, "wiki": true, "reads": 21, "score": 3439.2, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [186, 4, 15, 179, 24], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3893, "user_id": 43, "topic_id": 762, "post_number": 5, "raw": "[quote=\"SofiaAnner, post:1, topic:762\"]\nMetall verkstad\n[/quote]\nCNC plasma/gas cutter 3x1,5m cuts metal up to 40mm and steel up to 160mm\nMIG, TIG and MMA welding machines\nSemi automatic band saw\nFull automatic band saw\nForklift 1,6t\nMobile crane 0,84t\nMagnet drill\nchain saw\nHand machines\n2 compressors\n2 3D printers", "created_at": "2020-04-01 17:54:48.531738", "updated_at": "2020-04-01 17:54:48.531738", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 57, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 72.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [3323], "is_reply_to": [3323], "is_liked_by": [205, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4788, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1048, "post_number": 14, "raw": "[quote=\"MariaEuler, post:12, topic:1048\"]\nok, will see how to get in contact there\n[/quote]\n\nThat would be super cool!", "created_at": "2020-05-14 19:20:09.560608", "updated_at": "2020-05-14 19:20:09.560608", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 21, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 2.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [4784], "is_reply_to": [4784], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2783, "user_id": 92, "topic_id": 642, "post_number": 14, "raw": "Hey all!

We are reaching out to several graphic designers to support us on continuity with the style of the still image posts that we make. \n\n* For **donations of materials**, we need to be more specific about exactly what we need, and frame those things one by one. Kim are taking individual pictures of the things that we need, for sharing on social media. Eg. one photo of a package of overhead films, one photo of plastic rolls, one photo of heat guns etc. \n\n- Under each photo we will add information to either donate the thing asked for, or to swish the amount so we can buy it:\n1 plastic rolls = X amount of money =  X number of gowns to medical staff in need\n1 heat gun = X amount of money\nand so on...\n\n- we have an illustrator who would like to contribute with making a poster if we want to. \n\n## Other things\n\n* All communications should include the Blivande logo as well as a link to the new webpage that @hugi has made. This is the hub for information which will be constantly updated, so all separate posts on this topic should funnel people through to there [https://www.blivande.com/#covid19](https://www.blivande.com/#covid19)\n\n* We haven't discussed this, but we could temporarily update the cover photo on our Facebook page to show info about what we are doing right now. In a stylish way, maybe with the help of a designer. @SofiaAnner what do you think? @kim I think it depends on how it's done, let's ask the designer about this!", "created_at": "2020-04-09 08:43:44.655757", "updated_at": "2020-04-14 10:17:57.210214", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 533, "wiki": true, "reads": 13, "score": 22.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [205], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5957, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 1244, "post_number": 9, "raw": "Great to meet you in person yesterday @Gravklot ! \nHope to see you back here soon again.", "created_at": "2020-07-23 20:53:39.858466", "updated_at": "2020-07-23 20:53:40.028239", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 16, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 1.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [5947], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2233, "user_id": 15, "topic_id": 359, "post_number": 67, "raw": "I\u2019m game once I\u2019m back in the new year!", "created_at": "2019-12-22 23:31:20.473338", "updated_at": "2019-12-22 23:31:20.473338", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 11, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 47.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1162, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 270, "post_number": 11, "raw": "Yes, I really like it as well!

It would also be quite an inspirational room to just sit in while doing other work.\n\nThere are two rooms that come to mind for me. One is the current \"container project room\" and the other is the current \"painting room\". In practice, most painting is done in the big common workroom with the big tables, so I think it would be feasible to turn the corner room into one full of plants and life. \n\nIn the meantime, since Linda needs a place to vacate her Kombucha cultures and silkworms to in a hurry, I have said that at the very least she could keep it in the tiny storage room in the basement as it's the smallest and perhaps easiest to heat control.\n\n[quote=\"LindaNurk, post:1, topic:476\"]\nIf you are curios, I am happy to send you some links about raising silkworms etc.\n[/quote]\n\nThis is EXACTLY the sort of specialized expertise we should have in this house. <3", "created_at": "2019-11-06 17:59:08.805482", "updated_at": "2019-11-06 18:06:24.199017", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 311, "wiki": false, "reads": 23, "score": 69.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [1845], "is_reply_to": [1845], "is_liked_by": [122, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3776, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 647, "post_number": 32, "raw": "Social distancing measures will likely persist for a number of more months.

Such centers decentralize decision making and have different needs than centers with centrally curated programs. They also rely on unhindered convening in physical space which has been hard in the pandemic, calling for development of participatory processes online. We bring together three participatory cultural centers, one partner in online community building and one network of 80+ cultural spaces.\n\n> **Describe the network\u2019s activities and time schedule (what, where, when?)**\n> \n> Planning phase, January to February. We plan the program for the three subsequent embassy visits and coordinate with participants, venues and invited speakers.\n> \n> Our first embassy visit will be at Blivande in March. Participants from Iceland and Denmark visit Blivande for a week of activities, aiming to learn from the Blivande network, answering four central questions for each hub:\n> \n> 1. Evaluate the patterns and methods of co-creation and participation. What has been successful and what could be improved?\n> 2. How can hubs for participatory culture be active and constructive co-creators of their cities? 3. How can the participatory processes that are developed at these hubs be used for culture, art and society as a whole?\n> \n> 4. How can online tools be used to enable a participatory ethos and governance, making these organizations transparent and accessible?\n> \n> This format will be repeated for embassy weeks at Institut for (x) and Guvuhver. These embassy visits will involve a larger group (min. 30 people) from the hub that is being visited, along with relevant invited people from the host city. Representatives from Edgeryders and Trans Europe Halles will participate in at least one of the three embassies.\n> \n> After the last embassy week, a period of evaluation follows to collect learnings and prepare for dissemination of results. Finally, a seminar will be organized in October through the Trans Europe Halles network to share the results with other cultural hubs, and documentation will be made available online.

Keeping traces of what came before creates continuity and identity in a city. For us at Blivande, this means that when the freight containers disappear from Frihamnen, we would like to keep some of them behind. This is exactly what creative communities are often good at doing in industrial and post-industrial environments.\n\nFrihamnen just celebrated its 100th anniversary. In honor of its history, we collaborated with the Ports of Stockholm to build the first phase of a creative hub with containers. We built a colorful container village full of art and activities as a backdrop for their celebrations. We call it Frihamnstorget.\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1--2\">Our vision for Frihamnstorget</h2>\n\n![68974242_2095685624068001_8038071091630964736_o|666x500,75%](upload://wSB1kg3HQf3bQEsYv7dNhPKgFmY.jpeg) \n*Early model of Frihamnstorget*\n\n![UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_2ef8|666x500,75%](upload://8MUjgJrkOepd4JYLnrTBLOvXZyI.jpeg) \n*From the 100 year anniversary of Frihamnen and the opening of Frihamstorget*\n\nFrihamnstorget should be a true \"[third place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place)\". It is not just a place for culture and art but is itself a beautiful and exciting work of art. Frihamnstoget questions established principles of city planning and placemaking in Sweden today, and we are tilling the earth for the creativity of its members.\n\nFrihamnstorget is a work of art with no single vision. It is co-created by the initiatives and creativity of the different people and organizations involved. This process of co-creating a public place through citizen initiative is itself a work of art and an experiment in self-organization and creativity. It should feel like a tiny container village, full of art and culture, but also workshops for craftspeople, creative businesses, food, and drink. \n\nFrihamnstorget and Blivande should also be a foundation for community-run and community-owned businesses, creating an opportunity for people to create good lives for themselves and others.\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1--3\">Temporary permanence: Learning from other port cities</h2>\n\nAs we all know, nothing lasts forever. Eventually, our containers will have to be moved. However, some buildings live longer lives than others. For example, we are hoping to stay in the house for at least 10 years. Other structures we occupy or build might have shorter lifespans. You might call it a philosophy of _temporary permanence_. We are learning a lot on how to build a community in these conditions from the creative communities of Aarus. One of them is [Institute for (X)](https://institutforx.dk/), perhaps our biggest inspiration for Frihamnstorget.\n\nInstitute for (X) have become experts at building \"temporarily permanent\" structures that create infrastructure for creative communities. \n\n![DJI_0147|666x500,75%](upload://jgL126aJ60w2hQz4Ll7YSM3Y8C.jpeg) \n*Institute for (X) from above*\n\nIntegrating these sorts of structures into industrial or post industrial spaces can mean that areas that would otherwise be devoid of human activity and culture suddenly come to life. Institute for (X) have referred to this as moving from a model of instant reconstruction which leaves big open wounds in a cityscape for years.\n\n![1c7c26de4116efa10acae07db405d56a06bf6920|690x475](upload://43Zmwi2S4ASgsjsl5SSOiT0fzyM.jpeg)\n*Illustration by Institute for (X)*\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1--4\">Adaptive reuse for a more sustainable port</h2>\n\nAn important part of becoming more sustainable and energy-efficient is to switch to more modern technology. New technology often requires new buildings and infrastructure. One example of this is how container freight shipping makes warehouses in ports largely redundant. \n\nAccording to the World Green Building Council, 11% of worldwide carbon emissions come from construction. This means that the embodied carbon footprint of a building is immensely important. If a building is in use for longer, more value is extracted from that embodied carbon. Putting these buildings to use instead of tearing them down might be among the most efficient sustainability actions one can undertake. Raising new buildings to replace the old is a large source of carbon emissions.\n\nOf course, old buildings can have major problems. They are often badly insulated and air-conditioning or heating them is often very inefficient. This causes problems if you rebuild them into hotels, traditional apartments or high-end offices. Creative communities often solve these things differently as they are often looking to minimize costs. Expensive air-conditioning often isn't an option. A music venue, a photo studio, an art workshop or a gallery space does not have to be temperature controlled in the way an office does. Creative communities also often find innovative ways around these challenges, like building custom insulated parts inside buildings.\n\nIt's also the case that a high concentration of creative communities is likely to foster experiments in urban greening. It's hard to imagine that the wildly successful [High Line Park](https://www.thehighline.org/history/) would have become a reality without the creative communities of New York pushing for it. A bridge with a huge embodied carbon footprint became a green oasis. \n\n# <h2 id=\"heading--2\">Who is running the Frihamnstorget experiment?</h2>  \n\nBlivande, the organization that runs [House Blivande](https://blivande.com), is the steward of Frihamnstorget. Blivande is managed by @hampus, @Linnea, and @hugi. We rent the land from the Ports of Stockholm, and we are legally responsible for Frihamnstorget.  Blivande needs to make sure that Frihamnstorget makes enough money to sustain itself. This includes paying for rent, maintenance, necessary improvements and eventually salaries of those managing its commons. Blivande also leads the negotiations with the Ports of Stockholm to extend our contract. We are currently on a one year contract, but our ambition is to create a vibrant place to get it extended. \n\nAlthough Blivande is responsible for Frihamnstorget to the Ports of Stockholm, we are committed to it being a truly co-created place. We run Frihamnstorget as a collective of initiatives united by a set of common goals and principles. This platform, forum.blivande.com, is our primary place to organize and where we make and document decisions. We also hold meetings at House Blivande and at Frihamnstorget, and those meetings will always be announced on this forum.\n\n# <h2 id=\"heading--3\">Getting involved</h2>  \n\nMost people involved in Frihamnstorget are members of Blivande or The Node. We are in this together, so start by joining the community. It will become a lot easier for you to gain momentum for your initiatives once you make friends and get to know the community. Introduce yourself in a new thread, let us know who you are and what you desire!\n\nA growing number of creative and talented people have gathered around Frihamnstorget. Currently, most aspects of Frihamnstorget are open to your initiative, granted that you have the skills required and are willing to put in the work to make things happen. As we move forward, we will settle into roles and responsibilities, but we want to avoid a traditional hierarchical organization. Frihamnstorget should be a place for experimentation and citizen initiative, where its members have the power to act to improve it.\n\nThere are many opportunities for you to get involved. One good place to start is to post in the forum, and we will connect you to the people you should talk to. Things change quickly, so instead of having a traditional organization map with pictures and emails, we instead encourage you to get in touch here on the forum so that everyone gets a chance to get to know you. It saves both you and us the endless chain of introduction emails, and our conversations can be read by other people who also want to get involved. We rely on the power of the crowd to connect you. Go ahead and try it!\n\nIf you want to contribute to Frihamnstorget and have a specific idea in mind, post it in [the Frihamstorget group](https://forum.blivande.com/c/tau/frihamnstorget) on the forum. It is then up to the existing group of co-creators of Frihamnstorget and Blivande to make the decision on if we can bring your initiative to Frihamnstorget.\n\nIn summary, contributing a new project to Frihamnstorget if you are not already involved works like this:\n\n1. You post your proposal in [the Frihamstorget group](https://forum.blivande.com/c/tau/frihamnstorget) on the forum. Expect to participate in making sketches, answering questions and adapting your proposal according to advice.\n2. A current co-creator of Frihamnstorget gets convinced by your proposal and starts an advice process to make your project a part of Frihamnstorget.\n3. If your project is approved in an advice process, it's still on you to make your project happen. Start working with other co-creators to make it a reality.\n\n# <h2 id=\"heading--4\">Being a co-creator of Frihamnstorget</h2>  \n\nAs a co-creator of Frihamnstorget, you are trusted to initiate and participate in decision making. Much of the work involved in creating Frihamnstorget is publicly visible in the forum to make it easy for everyone to join, but only co-creators of Frihamnstorget can participate in making decisons. These groups are considered co-creators of Frihamnstorget:\n\n* All members of Blivande. On this forum, you recognize them by the title \"Blivande Member\" and a little Blivande badge on their profile picture. If you have one of these, you are in: ![blivandelogo|25x25](https://forum.blivande.com/uploads/blivande/original/1X/27551808792ea44af8765202d4bebc17ef82757a.png)\n* All people running on-going projects that bring significant cultural or financial value to Frihamnstorget. Everyone in that group who is not a Blivande member has the title \"Frihamnstorget Co-creator\" and a little container badge like this: ![container|25x25](upload://5oO3ZFtMZ9xB3mUoVrzAeNzsY84.png) \n* All people approved as co-creators of Frihamnstorget by an advice process. These also get a container badge.\n\nAll co-creators of Frihamnstorget are added to a protected group which gives access to a closed part of the forum where we discuss things that for some reason can not be completely public. If you are in that group, you are considered a co-creator of Frihamnstorget. If you think you should be in that group, but you are not, contact @hugi. \n\n# <h2 id=\"heading--5\">Making decisions</h2>\n\nFrihamnstorget is a place for creative innovation and open to your initiative. There is no single person, board or committee that calls the shots. Instead, you are invited to make proposals, gather advice and take initiative. We call this the **Advice Process**.\n\nOur goal is that to the largest possible extent, decisions affecting Frihamnstorget as a whole should be made by using this process. We are still learning, and there will probably be mistakes and fuckups along the way, but we believe this is our way forward to becoming a truly co-created public place. Used together with the Conflict Escalation Process, the Advice Process defines how power is used at Frihamnstorget.\n\nOur ideal is that **each decision is made by the person most qualified to make that decision**. This is easy to say, but takes some practice to get right. If you want to make a decision, how can you know that you are qualified? You do this by checking in with the community and seeking advice.\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--5--1\">Introduction to the Advice Process</h2>\n\nAt Frihamnstorget, the power to decide should rest with those who are going to do the work. In order to do this skillfully and without stepping on other's toes however, they need to gather advice and consent from those who will be affected by their decisions. By doing this they become the best qualified in the community to make a decision. Frihamnstorget is managed not through commands and control of a central authority, but rather by a network of temporary hierarchies based on the principle that power should flow to those who need it to take leadership. \n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--5--2\">Frihamnstorgets Advice Process: The Short Version</h2>\n\n**As an active co-creator of Frihamnstorget, you are free to make decisions.**\n\n**However, before you make a decision, you must ask advice from those who will be impacted by that decision, and those who are experts on that subject.**\n\n**Assuming that you follow this process, and honestly try to listen to the advice of others, that advice is yours to evaluate and the decision yours to make.**\n\n\nThis is what we call the Advice Process. Sometimes a decision leads to conflict, and in those cases, we use the Conflict Escalation process. These are the two processes that together govern Frihamnstorget.\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--5--3\">Making a decision, Step by step</h2>\n\nIf your decision does not affect a lot of people, you can just use the short version. Talk to those affected, make some calls, and make the decision. If it's something others should know about, post about it in the forum. However, if your decision affects a lot of people, use this step by step process:\n\n1. Talk to people about your idea. Try it out and listen to the feedback. You can do this in person or by posting your idea on the forum and discussing it here.\n\n2. Once you have a clear idea, make a post on the forum with your proposal. Include sketches, timelines, budgets, and requirements. A clear proposal makes it easier for others to engage and give you advice. \n\n3. Answer any clarifying questions.\n\n4. Receive and resolve principled objections, and modify the proposal as appropriate. Be open to taking back your proposal if there is important advice that you had not considered.\n\n5. Decide to go ahead with your proposal or not, based on the advice. That decision is yours to make.\n\n6. If you decide to make a decision, make that very clear by stating: \"I am making the decision to XXXX\". Make sure to include any alterations you made according to the advice in the final description of your decision, like modified deadlines, budgets or drawings.\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--5--4\">Conflict escalation</h2>\n\nConflicts happen no matter what. A well functioning community isn't one where conflict doesn't happen, but one that handles conflict in a productive way. Used together with the Advice Process, this process defines how power is held and practiced at Frihamnstorget.\n\nSometimes, someone might make a decision that someone else really disagrees with. In these cases, we have a conflict on our hands. If this happens, follow these steps:\n\n**Level 1:** Start with yourself. What do you need to take care of yourself in such a way that you can handle this situation in the most productive way? How can you better listen and try to understand the opinions and arguments of the other side? Start finding that place in yourself, then try to resolve the conflict. If you\u2019re still stuck, move on to the next level.\n\n**Level 2:** Find an impartial mediator, a space holder who can facilitate the conversation. The role of this individual is not to have an opinion on the matter or try to make judgments, but to make sure that both sides listen to one another.\n\n**Level 3:** If one of the conflicting parties at this stage refuses to participate in the arbitration process, or if no agreement between the two parties can be reached, the board of Blivande will make the decision. To escalate a conflict to this level is to be considered a complete breakdown of self-organization and something we hope to never happen.\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--6\">Get in touch</h2>\nThe easiest way to get in touch is to just write a reply to this post and join the conversation.\n\n**Remember, this document is just a draft. It's open to feedback and re-interpretation by our members and interested third parties alike. Please consider this grounds for discussion, rather than a final document.**", "created_at": "2019-10-17 01:25:49.403658", "updated_at": "2020-06-23 22:42:21.990439", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2816, "wiki": true, "reads": 49, "score": 4419.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [43], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8980, "user_id": 13, "topic_id": 1742, "post_number": 7, "raw": "This means a lot for the students who have been studying remote for the last 3 months and are going slightly crazy from collaborating in big teams over Zoom 9-18 every day :)", "created_at": "2020-12-10 19:27:59.773165", "updated_at": "2020-12-10 19:27:59.773165", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 33, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 106.6, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [8979], "is_liked_by": [34, 8, 15], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1761, "user_id": 97, "topic_id": 459, "post_number": 5, "raw": "To clarify.

Based on a media ethnography carried out in Germany, the UK, and the USA it is demonstrated that the two movements adopt different curatorial models: curation through the use of an \u2018unenforced trademark\u2019 in the case of the Quantified Self movement and curation through \u2018franchising\u2019 in the case of the Maker movement. The fragility of both models is not necessarily a disadvantage to either and it has contributed to the rapid global spread of both communities. An analysis of these curatorial practices demonstrates that while these communities like to present themselves as having emerged from local groupings, rising \u2018from below\u2019, they are, in fact, figurations whose origin and overall exertion of influence can be traced back to Silicon Valley and the Whole Earth Network.\n\nAuthos: [Andreas Hepp](https://journals.sagepub.com/action/doSearch?target=default&ContribAuthorStored=Hepp%2C+Andreas) \n(His work on deep mediazation might also be of interest)\n\n\n2. note: Prof. Fred Turner (https://fredturner.stanford.edu/essays/), (https://fredturner.stanford.edu/books/from-counterculture-to-cyberculture/) (does someone coincidentally have the book? maybe @brooks?)", "created_at": "2020-05-28 09:08:16.206026", "updated_at": "2020-05-28 09:36:00.347398", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 227, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 51.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8193, "user_id": 306, "topic_id": 1614, "post_number": 24, "raw": "We can look at it covid-19 from purely medical values and come to different positions.\n \nPersonally, I see it from the outside to protect Noden and Blivande from unnecessary attacks from the authorities if, for example, we were to become part of spread of infection. \nLike those that happened with various events where people are infected and become hung out in the media as unreliable and nonchalant.

Ideal the bottom should have detachable and adjustable legs to raise up the pyramid, and make it level on uneven ground. Some kind of telescope system perhaps.\n\nI also need to work out what kind of material the inner support pyramid frame should be.

Maybe cover image can be a slide show (I personally am not a fan of slide shows, but knowing we have so much great imagery, and that this particular cover image has been around for some time, perhaps it could at the very least be a different image each time), make sure visitor is exposed to some large tasty imagery\n\n2. I think the flip cards in the beginning that shows the \"tell me more\" can go directly to the Forum Post, and that the forum posts have exaggerated typography, ie. much larger and extremely visible prices + way more images. Like if we are communicating an apartment.\n\n3. Before the Flip Cards I think it could be beneficial with some additional text that informs the visitor what the Flip Cards hold and also the events, something that leads us into it. The  Hero text is good, but there could be a bit more following it. Also, it could include some more clear Call to Action. It's not obvious that this is a place where you can do some serious work, you still have to kind of search for it. The less clicks the better imo, and the more we can guide the user without them searching.\n\nFor instance, the \"our mission is co-creation\" part is somewhat hidden and we relies on the visitor even scrolling down that far, let's have essential information straight up.\n\n4. Would be nice if the whats going on-blocks where uniform in size, from hat I can tell it's the **title** that doesn't overflow: hidden\n\n5. Search for Events is a bit redundant.\n\n6. I'd put Partners and Collaborators at the bottom, it really breaks up the nice imagery atm, would be nice to simply just see the images and not have them too interupted by big blocks of either text or color.\n\n7. Partners and collaborators is lacking a \"t\"\n\n8. Would love a simple \"Write Hugi or Hampus if you are interested in joining\" - doesnt have to be your names, but this could be very clear and obvious.

Total budget for the Transforma project was 2.7 million SEK for two years, of which 1 million was the grant and the other 1.7 million were income different sorts of memberships, courses and events in collaboration with other activities in the house that Tau would share. Out of those 2.7 million, we budgeted 500 thousand (excl. VAT) for investments in tools and machinery. However, even though we got a grant of 1 million, we can't spend the entire 400 thousand all at once. This is because it was a part of a budget of a total of 2.7 million, which also includes  income from the Blivande memberships and events. We need to mind our liquidity, as we have rent to pay every month.\n\n# Average monthly investment budget until May 2020\n\nI have come up with the following spending schedule for Tau. These are *average* numbers, and we can concentrate the finances a bit more than 30k monthly. If we don't spend anything one month, we can spend 60k  the next month, but we can't really pull off spending 90k in a single month. We should really try to even it out if we can. \n\nSome expensive machines (50k+) we will have to lease or pay in instalments. When the time comes to buy a CNC mill for example, I will probably go to the bank and sign a contract to lease it.\n\n| Month  | SEK    |\n|--------|--------|\n| Jan 19 |      |\n| Feb 19 | 30.000 |\n| Mar 19 | 30.000 |\n| Apr 19 | 30.000 |\n| May 19 | 30.000 |\n| Jun 19 | 30.000 |\n| Jul 19 |        |\n| Aug 19 |        |\n| Sep 19 | 30.000 |\n| Oct 19 | 30.000 |\n| Nov 19 | 30.000 |\n| Dec 19 |        |\n| Jan 20 | 30.000 |\n| Feb 20 | 30.000 |\n| Mar 20 | 30.000 |\n| Apr 20 | 30.000 |\n| May 20 | 30.000 |\n\nNote that I'm assuming we don't buy anything in July and August, and that we are not expecting to buy anything in December, which is because it looks like December might be a frugal month before we get the next annual payment from the Node in January. Of course, this may change if we recruit members to Beta and Tau faster than we are currently predicting. Likewise, if we get more surplus than we are currently expecting due to faster than expected growth of our revenue stream, we can invest more than the 480k we currently have planned.\n\nIn case we really feel the need to make a large investment after the summer, I could also look into lumping our budget for the fall and 2020 together in a single sum and going to the bank for an investment loan that we'd pay back within a year. Interest on that should not be too bad.\n\n## What does this mean for the coming two months?\n\nWe have currently budgeted around 60k for outfitting the wood workshop (@Jan_vL, @hampus, @juliaa, @LinearMilk, @Sero, @dsandber, @annielocke ). This lays a good foundation. Buying the digital router @dsandber suggested is also possible, as long as we can pay him back in instalments over the coming year. We also want to get started on outfitting the textile workshop (@AnjM, @brooks) soon.\n\nBy being a bit smart, we could for example spend our money this way in the coming three months:\n* Spend 30k in cash in February on Blocket items, tools bought in Germany.\n* Spend 30k in February invoiced in stores where we have credit, giving us 30 days to pay (using March budget).\n* Spend another 30k invoiced in March or on our company credit card, using April budget.\n\nWe would then have another 60k to spend in the spring when people start building art for The Borderland, Burning Man and other participatory events.", "created_at": "2019-02-11 14:21:14.819382", "updated_at": "2019-02-11 14:41:15.803798", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 641, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 37.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [9, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3896, "user_id": 43, "topic_id": 635, "post_number": 30, "raw": "@spargeltarzan what software are you using and what CNC controller has it ?

One of the \"types\" of post we will make is called **\"What are you up to right now?\"**. It's a way of showing our personalities and the things we do. \n\n**Here's how to help us by making videos for our social media:**\n- Get out your phone and call someone by their name with the question. E.g. \"Hey Sofia, what are you up to right now?\"\n- The video clip should be 30s-1m long\n- Get consent from the person before you film, or at least before you send it to me\n- Please film in portrait for now, and try and keep the phone relatively still and smooth as you move it\n- Bonus points for cool framing\n- Send to me. Not sure if you can do that here. Or 0706817331/kim.gajraj@gmail.com\n- The winner of \"best post\" will be decided each week by how many engagements the post gets. Lots of glory involved in this title obvs.\n\nI'm going to try now and create some kind of interactive post so that we can collaboratively keep updated with What's On at Blivande all in one place, and use that for keeping tabs on making sure we are documenting the mind-blowing things everyone is doing around the house/frihamnstorget. \n\nHowever, it doesn't need to be a big event to make a video. If you see someone on a nice stage of their maker project, or someone's coming back from a walk in the sunshine, or you have a spontaneous mini-dance party, etc. etc. etc., then it's all great stuff. \n\nWe are just trying to capture authentically what it's like to be at Blivande in a snappy way, so that's a guide for you, albeit slightly vague. Let's see how this evolves, and please contact me with any questions!  \n\nIn general I am still getting to grips with this platform so do let me know if I do something not-smart :heart:\n\n**For those who are interested, other types of posting we will be doing for social media:**\n- \"Makers' diaries\" \u2013 more edited clips (still short) that follow different makers and the progress of their creations. Please reach out to me if you wanna make a diary. Currently tracking Bob and Nina as the first subjects! \n- Stories: For Facebook and Insta stories we really want to zoom in to the everyday. Small things, like turning on a lamp (today we had Mike screwing a screw, Cecilia lifting the BBQ lid, etc.). The cosy tiny details of everyday life in the house.

I'm very happy to see that this work has started.\n\nI agree with the mental health perspective you bring up. Noden supplies an important civic service to the society, and putting our operations to a halt should not be done lightly. I had to think this through the whole day yesterday to balance the perspectives against each other.\n\nWith that said, I want to clarify that it is not FHM's recommendations we're following with the proposed temporary close-down, but the local recommendations from Region Stockholm. Earlier this year the Regions didn't have a mandate to take local action, and instead the rules where applied for the whole country by FHM. The new laws passed give us better granularity to have local recommendations where the Covid spreading is as worst. Unfortunately, Stockholm is one of those regions now. \n\nMy proposed decision was to halt the operation (all workshops etc) during the period up until 19th November, and during this time work on guidelines for how to better prepare our workshops, so we can open up again with better prepared for the tough situation will most certainly have during the long dark winter when Noden is needed the most.\n\nSince this is a strong recommendation from the local authorities, I don't see that we can avoid following them. We need to cut down the infectious spreading rate, and it's going to take a toll on all of us. But if we do it, then hopefully it is only for three weeks and not for the whole winter.\n\nOnce again, I want to encourage you to continue the creative work in finding safety precautions that can keep the workshops going, it will come to good use sooner if not later!", "created_at": "2020-10-30 14:18:24.017831", "updated_at": "2020-10-30 14:18:24.017831", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 342, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 18.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [109], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5870, "user_id": 183, "topic_id": 1219, "post_number": 19, "raw": "Amazing!

Alternatively we just sell the tape at cost and come up with a scheme to buy back the unused amount by doing a rough estimate of how much remains -- 1/4 or less, 1/2, 3/4....\n \nIdeally the area with the locker would have a camera pointed at it for extra security.  I don't think there's a lot of thieves around, but if the tool disappeared it would be such a bummer that I think it's work being a bit paranoid to prevent it...\n\nAnyway, just trying to get the conversation started...

If we get it, I will update you further on what it means, but the idea would be to invite the community to build and create together. Here is a summary of the application.\n\n______\n\nOur expo is a curated, accessible, collection of open source solutions for green-and-social urban living. By \u201csolutions\u201d we mean technologies, social arrangements, business models and aesthetic design patterns. This exploration happens in three sites in Brussels, Bologna, and Stockholm. We aspire to develop this collaboration into a global network of social-and-green urban spaces.\n\nBehavioral change can be a powerful force in decarbonizing the economy. But most people see it as buying small environmental benefits with large personal sacrifices. This is a hard sell and has failed to happen at scale. A city is not only made of streets, buildings and urban infrastructure. A city is all these things, plus the knowledge and the skills embedded in its local community. The latter enables the maintenance, adaptation, development, and improvement of physical infrastructure. That's why:\n\n1. we do not aim for incremental change. Instead, we rewire urban life into a different configuration. Helped by an enabling space, people's carbon footprint shrink naturally.\n2. we see behavioral change as something communities, not individuals, do. We harness humans\u2019 evolved ability for working in groups and put it to the service of radical behavioral change.\n3. we focus on people who already aspire to behavioral change. \n\nThe Reef rewires the city's software towards \u201cgreen\u201d and \u201cresilient\u201d. It makes an alternative way of living visible, achievable, and aspirational. It teaches how to live a harmonious urban life that acknowledges climate change, and takes charge for it: this means adaptation, leading to resilience (microclimate improvements, insulation), also mitigation, leading to emission cuts (energy efficiency, circular economy, urban agriculture and so on).\n\nIn Stockholm, Blivande brings art and culture to the table, supporting a narrative of hope and opportunity in the face of climate emergency. Blivande is also situated in the harbor of Stockholm, which is undergoing one of the largest urban developments in Europe, Stockholm Royal Seaport. In the next decade, 12,000 dwellings and 35,000 workplaces will be built there, as part of the Clinton Climate Initiative. As part of the Reef Network, Blivande can better inspire the efforts at Stockholm Royal Seaport with new hopeful narratives of how community-based innovation is an important factor to meet the global emergency.", "created_at": "2020-01-21 15:07:52.212110", "updated_at": "2020-01-21 15:07:52.212110", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 448, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 51.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1671, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 422, "post_number": 2, "raw": "[quote=\"jonasjohansson, post:1, topic:422\"]\n* AR and VR in the browser via A-Frame\n[/quote]\n\nThis might potentially interest @jakobskote\n\n[quote=\"jonasjohansson, post:1, topic:422\"]\n* Generative/abstract graphics using P5.js (@beckmans_rgb)\n[/quote]\n\nThis definitely interests me!\n\n[quote=\"jonasjohansson, post:1, topic:422\"]\n* Creative audiovisuals (live visuals, projection mapping) using Resolume\n[/quote]\n\nI have actually done a bit of this myself.

I'll segment it for clarity. \n\n**MACHINES**\nWe agreed that the Husqvarna overlocker is not sufficient to cover an actual overlocker machine. \nCounting all other expenses, we have an extra 3-4K available within our 30K budget. \nA regular (we could search for a second hand here too @brooks ?)  machine costs 6K. As mentioned, we could source a second hand one. \nThere is another machine option called Babylock, but it is twice as expensive.\n In the long term it would be very-times-10 suited for us because it adjusts to the thickness of a fabric when there are multiple users/different projects and is much easier to thread: the advantage is that a regular overlocker is difficult to thread for a regular user and if someone messes up or say, uses a very different fabric thickness after somebody else, it might stop production for that day as someone would have to re-thread it. And that is not an easy task. \n I think perhaps the Babylock could be a future investment, and for now we can buy either a used or new Overlocker (6K) which means we exceed our budget by 2K. In some time, we can sell the overlocker and buy a Babylock. Prices are outlined in the Excel doc. that I made. @hugi, please advise. \n\n**COSMETICS**\n We need to make this room look cool and magical, so that people want to come back and feel inspired doing their projects. \n We want to make this room operational mid-May (explained in later segment) so we really need more members to step up and help out with painting and decorating. \n I'm thinking cacti on the window ledges. Because why not. I also saw a peculiar colour from a photo showed to me by a colleague when he was visiting a castle in North India. \n This can be fun. \n Really lacking extra hands here.\n\n**DONATIONS**\nOn behalf of Tau, could we reach out for donations?\nThe most ambitious one is if anyone has a spare laptop, so that people can upload their embroidery files onto that.\n Other welcome donations are toys to be recycled as pin cushions. \n If we make a list of items people might have, would it be possible to reach out to the community and ask? \n\n**RECRUIT AND MOBILISE**\nAs above mentioned, we need a few more people to help out with the set-up, if possible.\nWe want to launch the space mid-May.

We can mention this would be a great way to support Blivande and also get trials of how the textiles rooms can be best put to use and just get more exposure. And help people out with their projects. \n I volunteer to spend a few weekends or evenings tutoring or helping with costume/etc. making. We need this momentum, I believe. Thoughts? \n\n\nI am also going to work on a basic training manual, LNT, rules, etc. as a prerequisite to using the room. @Jan_vL something you could help me out with if you are free?\n\nLast thing.

Been having some health problems, nothing severe but having me unable to get around to doing stuff.\n\nLast I was there we had an introductory course, but those attending probably needed more hands-on examples done, and help along their first solo projects to feel sure about using the machine. I was a bit rusty, and learning by doing is the best way. Its hard to condense and convey methods learned/developed over years of use. \n\nSo, to get cracking again, we first need to work out the issues with the machine, since it has not been running properly. In the spirit of learning together, and me being long-winded, I'm gonna type out the trouble shooting here in the forum. Hopefully we can resolve it faster this way too.\n\n**Olle reports it drops significantly in power after running for a while. There are many factors that can reduce power.** \nMost are due to regular use of the machine, and therefore are addressed in regular maintenance. *Smoke residue on lens/mirrors/laser tube business end, Poor fume evacuation.*\nOther factors are incorrect settings.\n*power/speed setting in software overridden/reduced in machine settings, incorrect focus*\nAlso mirror calibration can be off, and the laser tube degrades as a whole with use, etc..\n\n**BUT...**\nIntermittent power loss, that occurs after running a while, is probably because one of two hardware bits being at the end of its life. The laser tube power supply, which brings the voltage upp to a cosy ~20KV DC and exites the CO2 gas in the tube to produce the energy. If this one is old and tired it can have reduced effect as it is working and getting warm.\n\nThe other probable cause is insufficient cooling. Then laser tube is dependent cooled by a separate water cooling system, composed of a circulation pump and compressor radiator thingy.  This one has been thru a lot, from running dry, having its temp probe severed, being fed way to rich glycol blend and then some.. Also the system was hard to flush after the move.

This is the second time in a row that Peder's initiative ends up being left hanging in the air to eventually fall to the ground from a lack of response. This is a worrying signal as to the current vitality of our community (or rather community in the making). \n\nI'm also not without fault in this as I had promised to mail out a reminder about this event to all of our members. Something I ended up forgetting while trying to tend to some of the fires of tonight's party. I'm sorry about that Peder! \n\nFor various reasons our efforts towards long-term community building (this dinner being an example of what we set out to arrange at least once a month) has been temporarily set aside to give focus to more short-term pressing issues. This is of course not sustainable as the community is the very raison d'\u00eatre of Blivande, which our success or failure ultimately rests on. \n\nThere are plenty of other co-working places (or makerspaces) to choose from if what we have to offer is not more than just that. Luckily enough we do have much more to offer and great synergetic evenings like that of yesterday provide a glimpse into that. But we need more of it and have plenty of nurturing and nudging to do ahead of us.\n\nFundamentally though we very much **need your help** in this if we are to succeed with this experiment. We all have to show up, in however way or form that we want to or can. Not every day or every time, but regularly. Here online yes, but more importantly physically in the house. And especially when someone is taking a clear initiative to create something for our collective benefit!\n\nThis is especially true for Tau which is and have always been a collaborative bottoms-up project in the vein of Borderland and Urban Burn, co-created by its members from start to finish. It won't happen unless you make it so as a community working together. The ones of us directly involved with Blivande will do our very best to help facilitate but we can't do it alone. And even if we could it would defeat the whole purpose. Today I spent a couple of hours putting in new door handles for the textile and future painting room and clearing out some of the clutter while Linn\u00e9a vaccuumed. And Joannis big PA now stands in the much improved techno temple! Things are progressing, slowly but steadily. But we need more hands on deck if we are to have a functional space before summer. \n\nMuch hangs in the balance this first fragile year. Let's all help push this thing in the direction of joy, purpose and community! \n\nP.S. \nYou're all invited to come and have dinner with Hugi, Linn\u00e9a and I on Monday evening at 19. Hope to see some you there despite the short notice. There will be a potluck dinner announced shortly for a later date. \n\nAlso the whole of next weekend the house will be full with 33 great people from all over Europe attending the Co-creative Leadership Development Program. Good opportunity to come in for some work and then hang out in the evening. \nD.S.", "created_at": "2019-04-27 20:55:10.750858", "updated_at": "2019-04-27 20:55:10.750858", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 579, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 97.6, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [28, 4, 9, 43], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2180, "user_id": 14, "topic_id": 359, "post_number": 61, "raw": "David already volunteered for that.

In Swedish. \n27 Feb \nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/622578074840262/", "created_at": "2019-01-30 14:33:04.777000", "updated_at": "2019-01-30 15:21:17.368939", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 55, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 22.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1948, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 491, "post_number": 1, "raw": "@asapienza is the first Blivande member to have a fixed desk at Tau (outside of the unfortunately very limited artist-in-residence program).

We discussed practicalities around this. More about these two phases in the [first Studio Tau info thread](https://edgeryders.eu/t/studio-tau-what-is-it-and-how-do-i-sign-up/9199).\n\n* Tau will always be an open ended collaborative space with shared responsibility.\n\t* Period 1 till October 1st: Experimental stage, figuring out what  equipment and needs should be met. Not all spaces will be set yet. \n\t* From October 1st, intention for things to be more set, rooms more specialised and no 'private' spaces apart from Artist in Residence.\n* Intention is cross-collaborative (encourage members to run workshops, initiatives, etc.)\n*  Effective time use. Maximise use of space.\n*  BETA: 32 members with access to Bata and Tau\n*  TAU: 32 members only Tau access   \n*  Model is flexible and experimental in its initial stages. \n* Discussion of business plan and sustaining the space economically/long-term is for another meeting: to be discussed in another platform and occasion if there is enough interest.\n\n## Studio Tau Communication Chanels\n* Facebook is unfavourable for multiple reasons.\n* EDGERYDERS FORUM: suggestion for slow/intermediate discussions, longer span discussions, long-term planning.\n* SLACK for shorter immediate communication (forum ineffective here.)\n* SLACK is not for decision making but for immediate communication. EDGERYDERS forum is better for decisions, planning and slower long-form discussions.\n* Long-term decisions and communication will be recorded via forum.\n* FORUM is for transparency of actions/updates. \n* BLIVANDE website in progress will be connected to the Tau forum. Different methods to promote events via these connected platforms/websites.\n\n# Other points\n\n* Fire Alarm: We recently accidentally triggered the fire alarm. It might become a problem with the automatic alarm. Costs of response is extremely expensive.

It's a combination of a book launch and a workshop in how to create neon signs. \n\nThe book is called **[Being and Neonness](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/being-and-neonness-translation-and-content-revised-augmented-and-updated-edition-luis-de-miranda)** and explores both the literal and the figurative history of neon, using it as a metaphor for the 20th century and the evolution of postmodernism. Or something along those lines. I haven't actually read it yet. :slight_smile:\n\nIn any case, the book has just been translated to English for MIT Press so as a celebration of this Luis has invited Nasser, one of Europe's last remaining neon glass-blowers. Nasser will lead a paid workshop for anyone interested in trying out this classic but now all but extinct craft. One goal of the workshop will be to produce a Blivande sign that we can later mount on the building!\nWe could probably create a special one for Studio Tau as well... \n\nIs anyone here interested in being part of either the neon workshop or the whole thing? Would be great with more people involved in organizing the events!\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/2281850065159886", "created_at": "2019-03-06 16:58:22.035434", "updated_at": "2019-03-06 16:59:17.752236", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 227, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 67.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 31], "is_private": false}, {"id": 684, "user_id": 34, "topic_id": 169, "post_number": 15, "raw": "Both initiative, for the general meeting and the dinner are truely great!

Having a big part of it then mobile and circumventing hotworks bureaucracy etc (and not having carved up the facade at Blivande) is great.\n\nBeing mobile we can rent it out (won't happen much but perhaps once a year or less) or bring it with us to festivals and what not. It's not at all lots of work to move it, it's a standard shipping container after all. It does cost money though, and 40' containers require more specialized/rare trucks than 20'.
