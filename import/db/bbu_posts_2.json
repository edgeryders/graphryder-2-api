The human mind wants deities like mirrors, and rejects as inhuman that which it cannot comprehend. Muted prayers, temples emptied or unbuilt, sacraments forgotten, and not a single child baptized by their fire - this is how holy telomeres shorten.\n\nYet in death they remain incorrupt, and their bodyminds are scattered throughout time and space. In these corpses the strangeness festers, until it rots through to the bedrock of the universe, and what was once strange becomes physics. Thus, in death, they create the conditions for their resurrection. \n\nConsider the case of the hundred-featured behemoth, who had one hundred names, though he is merely remembered as Elef. When he perished from the mind of the world his hundred legs became the father of all centipedes; later, his arms resurfaced, represented in the hundred pose knife dance of a bronze age culture.

I woke up today and couldn't shake the feeling it is Wednesday all over again, like I didn't sleep, just spaced out for a time and there is still so much more day to have to get through. I need my damn cello back, for company and to tell time. Myaskovsky's cello concerto takes 26 minutes and 13 seconds to play; I measure the day in bits of music, such as I can muster. The easy sadness of that piece seems appropriate.  \n\nI haven't seen any birds since I moved here, and I cannot see any trees from my window. This cannot hold. Perhaps I have made a mistake coming here, like living on Jupiter surrounded by Martians, no common tongue, and everyone walks at a different pace than me, so I get lost in the crowd and have to catch up. I look at my feet while I walk, now. I see all the things the Martians drop, their bits of paper, their earring backs, and small change. But they always look front, and always at something I cannot see, for the life of me.\n\nI bet K was a joy. I never understood her, not really. She always spoke of things that seemed part of a world run by people who didn't care about music or clouds or perfect beers, just always putting money in banks as though it was a sport. She is another one who walked too fast for me, looking at things I couldn't see. \n\nThe hash here is good, but expensive. I spent a very stoned hour listening to the A Major CPE Bach concerto. I thought I could see sense in the world while the hash seared my mind but I suspect it was just CPE cavorting around in there with the faeries, speaking to the spring on four strings. Then again, I always thought Bach was akin to madness anyway.\n\nI thought I could keep writing but the neighbors are fighting. She is calling him a bastard and he is screaming drunk. They sound like violence, like a wolf attack, all teeth and fur. I better go out or I will go mad. Besides, the CPE concerto is almost over and I can't take anymore allegro today.\n\nPlease take the meds.

His eyes fixed at the floor, and as his legs gave away, he fell in his knees. Someone should help, he thought urgently. No one should see me like this, he contradicted silently. \"Oh,\" he sighed, as another stab of hate pierced into his aura. Moments later, he was sprawled on the ground, his arms and legs buckled in complete paralysis. Quickly, and quite virulently, he was dragged into a back alley. The blood that gushed out of his nose formed a snail-trail as he disappeared into the obscurity. He was on the street, in broad daylight; there were no witnesses.\n\n* * * \n\n\"I gave you my all,\" Goldie whimpered, a day after Rump's disappearance. \"No text, no call,\" she continued. \"Nothing.\" \n\nShe did what she could do, and she followed protocol.

It looked crooked, and more like a Subway sandwich than a proper joint -- she didn't care. Goldie looked around for a lighter, but could not find anything. She stood up, began feeling her surrounding, exerting her mental powers to remember where she put it.

His eyes rolled and he let out a groan akin to a cornered animal. The coagulated blood blocked one of his nasal cavities. He let out a sharp exhale through the nose.

It was true to say that the Prince was, generally, rather pleased with himself and quite self-centred. Had he not been a prince he would have found it awkward to make friends at school and anywhere else. But he was the Prince and this was an incognito walk!

For four sevenths of the way down the avenue (easily measured by the fact that he had reached the fourth of seven enormous mansions that lined the easterly side of the avenue) his personal protection officers had come up to him \"Pardon your Highness, we need to escort you back to the palace immediately\".

I put Anahid under an anesthetic spell; she resumed her sleep peacefully. At around 10 o'clock in the morning. I couldn't help but sleep next to her, contemplating her figure. Her hair, though tainted with what looked like wolf blood, covered the other half of my pillow. I tried to move it away gently, but decided to lay my head on it, its texture against my cheek, her scent filling my nostrils. What is happening to me, I asked myself. Why did I feel this urge to be with her. Yes, *be* with her. Was it the grief subsequent to her death? Was it the surprise upon her return? Was it the phenomenal effort we both exercised to practice that which has not been done in millennia? Well, whatever it was, I surmise that my energy nudged her into wakefulness.\n\nHer voice was different when she first woke up, but it slowly relapsed back into its own unique tone. I thought I was never going to listen to it. After breakfast, she told me everything. \n\nDays before the complete lock-down, Anahid received a message by pigeon-post from someone who apparently held a personal vendetta against her family. An old ancient creature her great-great-great grandmother had cursed ages ago. She told me that she knew nothing of the matter, but that she discovered it when she inspected her great-great-great grandmother's diaries. Us, witches, we like to keep track of things, she said, pointing at this notebook. How odd. Anyway, she wanted to put an end to the curse, given that she was the only one capable of it. She traveled North-North, for that's where they decided to meet. Little did she know, there was an ambush waiting for her. The creature was not a wolf, though. It was a vulture the size of a parking ticket machine...\n\n---\n\n*\"What do you want from me?\" Anahid asked, mustering all her powers to sound composed.*\n\n*The vulture, Roc-like, tilted his head and opened his beak slowly. \"Ha,\" he said, simply. \"Ha, ha,\" he continued. \"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.\"*\n\n*Anahid fell into a bout of confusion. \"Are you... laughing?\" she posed.*\n\n*\"No,\" the creature said. \"I just said 'Fuck you' in my own humorous language. You know humor? You witches may not understand this.\"*\n\n*\"What the *hell* are you talking about?\" Anahid's anxiety wrapped itself around her stomach like a snake at a prey. \"What has she done to you?\"*\n\n*\"She didn't get my joke,\" the vulture said, shifting his claws. \"She didn't get my punch-line. So she turned me into this... this... Can't even fly with these things.\" He preened his feathers upon instinct.*\n\n*At that moment, Anahid noticed from the corner of her eyes hunched figures approaching from the obscurity in which the vulture stood. \"And you,\" he said, \"do you get my joke?\"*\n\n---\n\nWell, they took her. They injected something in her, that thing which turned her into this... new person that she is. She is theorizing that this warlock turned vulture is the one behind the pandemic within the magicals and non-magicals. Skeptical as I am, I should give this a thought. After all, she did exhibit the same signs the Unseen Police has warned us about. This is not what worries me -- what worries me is that she wants to see him again.

The wrought iron gates were overrun with vines--or, thought Victor, for Ashbury was too tightly a run ship for such carelessness, purposely camouflaged with the dark foliage of its surrounding, so that the occasional escaped patients of the lesser wards could not stumble upon it. It was not safe for persons with any sort of mental instability to be within hearing distance of Richard Corben (for that was how Victor first encountered him in the coroner's report and continued to think of him as) and the building could not be soundproofed.\n\n\"The man must be heard,\" explained Klein as they trudge up the steep stairs that lead to the entrance. A guard greeted them with a wordless nod and handed them little balls of cotton. \"If he isn't heard, if he is forced to keep his secrets to himself, he begins to self-destruct. We would lose our greatest connection.\"\n\nThe corridor was a dimly-lit maze that stretched so far into and around and through the building that Victor soon lost track of where he was. Goosebumps rose on his skin and tension began to tighten his spine into awkward stiffness. Before he could voice his concerns however, Klein stopped at a door, and with a look of significance, carefully swung it open.\n\nInside was an empty room, with a single wall made of glass. It revealed the adjoining room, which held a sparse bed from under which a chamber pot peeked, and a single metal chair welded to the floor upon which a man sat.\n\nThe man known as Richard Corben was a serene-looking young man despite the dark circles around his eyes and the great, defeated slump of his shoulders. Despite that his hands were constantly trembling, hard enough that the phone he held up in one knocked against his temple with the occasional jarring blow, his expression was the peaceful surface of an untouched lake, his smile a mild and polite question. His other hand was clenched so tightly in his lap that his knuckles had turned white.\n\nVictor was surprised to find that his lips were not moving. Richard Corben was reported to be a truthsayer of the worst kind; his words were poison and rot that clung to ear canals. Member of his audience had scratched and clawed so desperately that the sides of their heads were flattened, flesh and cartilage ripped off, blood streaming from the holes that were left of their ears.\n\nKlein pointed to Richard, and then tapped his own ear and raised an eyebrow in a universal question. *Can you hear?* \n\nVictor frowned in confusion, tilting his head away from the glass so that he could press his ear against it. If he concentrated, he felt he could hear a low hum buzzed at the base of his throat. Slowly, it increased in volume--bees from across the field, a distant rumbling thunderstorm that would come to obscure roads and send his little sister's car off side of that cliff, the low groan of the cancer ward he visited weekly as a child and his mother was wasting away but hated him enough that she would only allow him as near as the doorway of her room where he could witness her every groan and spasm of suffering to the spiteful curses she would hurl in his direction with what breath she managed because he was the evil that had brought her to this state, the demon, the wretched, how dare--\n\nKlein wrenched him away with so much force that sprawled to the floor. Furious, he whipped around, hateful rebuke already at the tip of his tongue, but Klein wasn't looking at him. He was staring into the room, steely determination almost masking the fear Victor could feel in the trembling hand he had on his arm. With looming dread, Victor turned to face the glass and recoiled in shock. \n\nRichard stood with his nose pressed to the glass. Though he faced straight ahead, his eyes stared directly down at Victor. The ghastly sound spilled from his half-parted lips, still curved into a smile. As they made eye contact, that smile grew wider even as his eyebrows slanted down with something akin to sympathetic pity. The corner of his mouth twitched once, and then again, and then again. \n\nWith horror, Victor realised that Richard was beginning to speak.", "created_at": "2020-07-04 14:23:18.492715", "updated_at": "2020-07-04 14:23:18.492715", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 760, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 2.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3964, "user_id": 144, "topic_id": 1247, "post_number": 4, "raw": "![Screen Shot 2020-08-25 at 06.58.30|690x269](upload://cZ5NmS606D3gGC0o5CdrLaeEPZJ.png)", "created_at": "2020-08-30 20:35:04.175526", "updated_at": "2020-08-30 20:35:04.175526", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 13, "wiki": false, "reads": 23, "score": 19.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [3954], "is_liked_by": [354], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1873, "user_id": 349, "topic_id": 887, "post_number": 4, "raw": "\"Gak.

Each unit has 10 circular tables with their own 4 seats. At 6.55am, just before opening, these are all in position with military precision. Then, within an hour or so, it is in disarray and everything is covered in sugar packets, half empty and soaked in cappuccino foam. One table will have 9 chairs, one will have 3, and one, none at all. All exits will be barricaded by thoughtlessly placed high chairs, all sticky with their own special baby filth and carrot sticks.\n\nThere is no music played at all in the vast concourse, so consequently the white noise of the chattering crowds of coffee-hounds sounds like an ominous swarm. The lighting is so bright, it\u2019s unreal. It's as if the light has blasted the ambience away. Yet no one complains. It is perhaps the most impersonal cafe in all of what is currently known as Europe. And impersonal suits Suzie down to the ground. She hates chat and music. She hates being a barista with an absolute thunder that follows her. A thunder that could cut down trees as she passes. Somehow - no one understands how - Suzie is Assistant Manager in her particular unit. She\u2019s been terrorising the Nightingale since she was dragged kicking and screaming out of lockdown. \u201cWe need to kickstart the economy again,\u201d they said. \u201cI\u2019ll kickstart your face,\u201d she mutters into her mask.

Everything has been sanitised, wiped, steamed, cleared away, adjusted, dragged from one unit to another, rearranged, replenished. The staff leave as a shambling, tired huddle.

See you tomorrow!\u201d \u201cBye.\u201d\n\nShe is about to switch the last one of the hundreds of lights off when she notices a dark heap in the distance near the furthest, most remotest part of the hall. Fucks sake.\n\nShe storms over, breaking into a jog. Approaching the matter, it becomes clear that it is a dead man. Or maybe asleep or unconscious. Very definitely inconvenient. She approaches to about a two meter distance and stops. Then a one meter distance. She can see that the dark haired, business-suited man has his face down in a little pool of blood on the table top. His nose is bent to one side in the thick, bright fluid. She notices after 5 minutes of staring, that he has the most strikingly vicious cheekbones. Like an actor or a model. She stares for another 5 minutes considering all the possibilities of what could be done, and done quickly and decisively. \n\n1. She could take him out and leave him by the bins. Then he would be a matter for the council, or the police or whoever.\n\n2. She could ring for an ambulance. But she really wanted to go home right now.

Maria felt like a cookie being preserved somewhere on a shelf. With her gaze fixed upwards, she made her way to the southern end of the rooftop. She gently laid her soft hands on the coarse surface of the parapet; she exhaled the breath she had been holding. This was the droplet of life that was rarely mirrored anywhere from TV to literature. That moment was infinite; infinitesimal and infinite. Could she admit to herself that this was the life she had fathomed as a juvenile girl -- she who lived to see things prematurely and still maintained a belief in building a new narrative elsewhere.\n\nA bat fluttered around her. She was still for a moment before remembering what her mother had once told her. \"They're very careful not to get you. But if they do, they'll most likely cling to your hair. You'll need a lighter to burn their feet.\" Without much thinking, Maria reached for her pocket. \"Fuck,\" she mumbled, not because she could not protect herself, but because she brought her Marlboro pack without any fire. Would she be able to find a lighter lying around? Could someone have forgotten one? She moved away from the parapet and continued to follow closely the bat's sharp angular shifts and turns.\n\nBy the entrance door, a dusty ladder stood upright, leading to a smaller rooftop. It was as spacious as her kitchen downstairs, with unprotected sides. A simple misstep or a second of vertigo would cost her a leg or a neck. What the hell, Maria thought. She climbed the ladder and heaved herself up with a sigh. She scanned her new surrounding panoramically and found the sky to be even more reachable; she was on top of Babylon. \n\nSearching for a lighter in that darkness was a feat, however. She removed her cell phone from her backside pocket and opened the flashlight. A second passed before she noticed something. What on earth, she thought to herself. Maria was standing on freshly painted neon-white stripes. Her guts detected foul play. Tugging at that thin thread of premonition, Maria lifted her cell phone to spread the beam of flash. It was then that she saw it: a circle within a circle intersected by a cross. Maria instinctively looked up, but the sky was as innocuous as a moment ago.

DENNIS BROOKEY\n\n\nI'm making my escape. The nation I've been visiting, like many others, has failed to contain the epidemic and staying here might mean months of sequestration. It's time to go home. Even if the situation there could be turn out to be just as dire. I'm catching what feels like one of the last flights out through the 'contaminated lands', as the airline infrastructure slowly and nervously goes into hibernation, trying to sleep off its disease. \n\nI wonder sometimes if the social structures built out of myriad human building blocks have anything resembling 'experience'. And whether, like us, that experience comes with just as much uncertainty and fear about dangers hard to perceive because they happen on the cellular level. \n\nI arrive at the airport in a bus with one other passenger. I check in my bag at the counter where five clerks are attending two travelers, myself included. I fumble with my gloves and feel the now familiar germophobia that is circling the globe. I walk through the terminal where the distance between passengers is well over what's necessary. I give a half-hearted smile to the woman waiting on another bench. We don't make conversation, and although that is simply business as usual in our modern world, it doesn't feel right. I decide that it's my responsibility be as kind to everyone I meet on this trip as I possibly can, because they're all fighting so hard. \n\nOn the flight I am one of ten passengers and eight crew members. Another passenger is meticulously cleaning her already deep-cleaned seat. The flight attendants are as courteous and kind as I've come to expect from many other flights. And there's something else happening in them. It's right below my ability to perceive it. I watch the flight attendant strapped into her chair during takeoff. And I start feeling it. Her tiredness from overwork. My eyes well up. Her uncertainty about her future. My tears are landing strips for the virus. About the people she cares for. I scramble for a handkerchief. It's an unfamiliar movement, I usually just wipe my eyes with my fingers or let the tears flow. I look out the window and down towards the mountains below, and I imagine and feel all the grief for the ever-present uncertainty, because this world feels so familiar and yet so very alien. \n\nHalfway across the continent, another black swan breaks away from the fractal cascade and swoops by the window: the layover airport has just shut down due to an outbreak in the air traffic control tower, the captain informs us. A jolt of fear shoots through me. I find myself attempting to create best and worst case scenarios despite woefully inadequate information. While thinking I touch my face. An older flight attendant comes through the cabin and asks me to pray. I converse with her on friendly terms, ask her a couple of questions she can't answer, and then close my eyes and recite the Enmei Juku Kannon Gyo for protection against calamities. Vocalizing the syllables slows my breathing down, vibrates my vagus nerve, and calms me to the level of what Tyler Durden would call a Hindu cow. And right then, 20 minutes and one full rotation of the plane after the announcement, the tower reopens and we're back on track.\n\nI have no idea what happens next.", "created_at": "2020-03-21 22:35:30.515464", "updated_at": "2020-03-21 22:36:02.830312", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 581, "wiki": false, "reads": 24, "score": 24.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [401], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2299, "user_id": 352, "topic_id": 933, "post_number": 4, "raw": "People just do stuff, you know.

It's only out of hard won experience I've had over the last nine months that has me make the bed. I've had to revise a lot of the minutiae of daily life that weren't part of the astronaut training program everyone had before they were stuffed into these titanium cans and catapulted into orbit to live out the next few years as humanity's contingency if things turn out really bad earthside.\n\nI roll to the exercise side. I'm just in time for my friend Pamela's streaming yoga/flex routine. We're both in similar eccentric 12 hour Molniya orbits, so our daily routines sync up nicely. In the beginning there was a lot of support from earthsiders to help us maintain ourselves and stay sane, but a number of factors have increasingly made us grow into mostly relating to our peers out here in the black. Cultural drift in the need to relate to others having similar experiences is already differentiating us. And there are practical concerns: exercise routines have had to be reinvented to make up for the insanity-inducing Coriolis effect of this habitat. Back-of-the-envelope math tells me that you'd need at least a 12 m radius cylinder to comfortably simulate gravity. For us? We got 4 and were told to make it work. It's been quite the journey to keep our nutrition paste in our bellies. \n\nAnd besides the practicals, there is the deeper emotional needs having to be met. Pamela doesn't guide me through her routine with words about feeling the support of the earth under me; she and I are both primates gracefully being centrifuged against outer titanium shells, our only protection from being flung into the black void.\n\nAfter Pamela's nervous system calming routine - I think I'm developing a minor crush on her - it's time to sit and meditate. There isn't much freedom of movement up here, but I've finally arrived through trial and error at a hack for my meditation where I can get the full outer space experience. The gold standard here is to be able to look down on the Earth. The Overview Effect is a luxury afforded by spacelife. But because what everyone needs for long-term survival is gravity. Those elite astro and cosmonauts of the 20th century? They spent an inordinate amount of time keeping everything including themselves squeaky clean and clear, because even the slight detritus of everyday living becomes a huge liability if it's floating in free space. \n\nSo the cylinder is rotating, and that dizzying spin can kinda ruin the majesty and tranquility of gazing at the great Earth. And just stabilizing it digitally feels like cheating. We want to be able to view it from the central porthole. So with a bit of help from my friends and a frivolous expenditure of maneuvering fuel, I've found a way to align my cylinder on a particular part of my orbit and spin my body counter to that so I can see the whole earth, stably, for a full hour at perigee.", "created_at": "2020-12-12 08:39:45.329566", "updated_at": "2020-12-12 10:18:11.584023", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 571, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3605, "user_id": 461, "topic_id": 1199, "post_number": 1, "raw": "![Babelbob end it 2 low|video](upload://rjw3pUGCTgxpMEp0wC77cyVwkMp.mp4) \n\nDear writers,\n\nIteration 2 has now ended, and the forum has been locked once again.

Uli furrows her brow because it seems to be coming from\u2026 \n\nPsst, comes the little voice again, and this time Uli leans closer to the tofu, tilting her head to hear better.\n\nWet hits her ear. She yelps at the cool sloosh feeling that buries itself into her ear canal before settling behind her eyes, a bit like brain freeze. \n\nAt once the world hums with a dull drone. Uli gasps and stumbles backward. Her back hits the shelf and the bells clang in their box. But even after they quiet, there is still this thrumming at the back of her skull. A rumbling of sorts. \n\nAnd Franc, squealing, \"I think it likes you! I think it's found its home!\" He beams at her. \"Thank you so much! How can I ever repay\u2014Oh! I suppose I have paid you!\"\n\nAnd Franc, laughing, delighted, despite that he's just, Uli's pretty sure, swindled her out of her first sale. This has to be a trick somehow\u2026 but try as she might, Uli cannot figure it out. It doesn't help that her head still aches a bit with that low frequency hum. The droning wavers in her ears, rising then cresting. She shakes her head in vain. The droning continues, so low and incessant that it almost seems to be coming from behind her. But other than that, she's none the worse for wear so for the moment, she gives up on that and tells him, \"For future reference, you should know you've misread the sign.\" \n\n\"Oh no! Is Wishes for Fishes what Mama calls figur-ruh-tiff?\"\n\n\"Figurative? Well no, the fishes are quite real, I assure you, it's just that\u2026\" Uli trails off again and decides it is best to show instead of tell. \"Let's try something. I want you to think of a bad feeling.\"\n\nThe boy's face falls and for a moment Uli thinks he will refuse, but when she wriggles her fingers in his direction, they slide through an aura around him that is viscous as honey. Nodding with approval, she sinks her pinky deep into the bad feeling, pressing closer until her fingertip touches his mouth. With a little flick of her wrist, she pulls her finger back and reels out from between his lips a fat neon tetra the size of her thumb, as blue as the sky and red as the boy's hair.\n\n\"A fish!\" Franc exclaims. He comes as close as he dares to peer at the little fish trashing about at the end of the invisible thread tethering it to her finger. \"This is one of them small fishies from our class fishtank! Leon's mum donated a whole bunch of them last month.\"\n\n\"Is that so?\" Colour her curious. Little boys didn't usually have bad fish of that size swimming around in them, not so near the surface anyway. \"Does Leon's mum make you feel bad?\"\n\n\"Leon's mum makes Leon feel bad. And when he tells me, I feel bad.\"\n\nUli pauses. She was planning to take the tetra as a little freebie but now *she* feels bad. \"Have you or Leon told anyone else?\"\n\nFranc shakes his head.\n\n\"Here, take this back then.\" With another flick of her wrist, the tetra snaps into the air and off its tether. With lightning speed, it zips back into Franc's awaiting mouth. \"It's important not to ignore bad feelings. Sometimes they tell you what needs to be done.\"\n\nFranc nods vigorously, wide-eyed. \n\n\"Well, what are you waiting for?\" cries Uli, \"I've fulfilled your wish and given you new purpose! Off you go!\"\n\nAnd as her first customer scampers out of the door, Uli decides that, you know what? Strange fish be damned. She can't let her first strange happening in her shop of strange happenings get her down! She'll deal with her earfish when the day is over.

Not for the obvious reasons; the show keeps delivering gruesome deaths and so many broken people you wonder if there will ever be a glimmer of hope. This makes Breaking Bad look like an 80s sitcom. We know what we are getting now.\n\nInstead, it is a storytelling problem we have to work ourselves through. The previous two episodes raised so many questions that we as viewers should have been entitled to some answers. None were delivered during this episode. Instead, it raised more questions for season 2.\n\nOver the last few years there have been far too many TV shows that drag on, that keep beating dead horses (or zombies, as it were) for the pure and simple reason of keeping viewers hooked and keeping that revenue stream flowing. I had hoped that the fact that the show's creator and runner, Brendan Clive-Jeff, has stated that there is already a three season arch written would mean that there would be a feeling of structure, even to the first season. As it stands, Gartside season 1 feels disjointed and incomplete, like a series of disconnected events and people rather than part of a whole.\n\nOf course, this may change during the second season. Perhaps things will start to come together as more of the tangled yarn that is Roland Gartside's story is unwound. Or perhaps Gartside will go the way of many other TV shows and eventually run on fumes before sputtering to a stop and dying an ignoble death.\n\nThere are, of course, plenty of good things here. As always, it is a gorgeous show, with muted tones and long shots, as well as hectic and frankly brutal action sequences. If this doesn't generate some Hollywood gigs for director of photography Gail Monaghan, something is not right.\n\nWhile the show has made it's way onto quite a few Best of the year charts (including this publication's), it does have a few problems it will have to address when season 2 premieres, other than When the hell are we going to get some answers?\n\nLike the first season of True Detective, Gartside lacks strong female characters. While Lori-Ann Metcalfe's Kathy does show promise, she will need more development if she is to carry the mantle of female lead. Metcalfe has proven herself for several years in indie films and we know she has the chops to making Kathy a true force of nature.\n\nAfter a full twelve episodes, only Gordon Schenker's sociopath priest Gabriel Lipka has been properly fleshed out, so character development is needed for more than just Kathy.\n\nSamuel Fenton keeps doing his best Peter Stormare impression as the murderous Bird, and needs more refinement if he is to grow into something memorable. Casper Diaz FBI agent Carlyle needs more depth than the cardboard cut-out he is right now, and Suleiman Kabir's street activist has to grow beyond angry scowls and spouting pseudo Anonymous one liners. There is so much room for improvement.\n\nSo two questions remain. Where is Roland Gartside, and can Gartside as a show grown strong enough to remain alive and well for two more seasons? Hopefully we will have answers to both in the coming season.\n\n- Cecil Greene", "created_at": "2020-06-19 19:35:32.983359", "updated_at": "2020-06-19 19:35:32.983359", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 564, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 17.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [3025], "is_liked_by": [335], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4410, "user_id": 414, "topic_id": 1323, "post_number": 4, "raw": "It's a sensual feeling, going absent.\nBecoming one with the spirits, the ghosts, the endless suffering\n\nPleasure, he says, as he tips his hat to nobody.\n\nThe air grows thin and cold as though watching leaves rust and fall.

If I were to be honest, Holly, most memories I have with you are now lost on me as well. I think compared to the experiences in my later life, my childhood \u2014 our childhood was rather dull.\n\nHB: Where does the fictional Isabelle come from?\n\nIE: Before I answer that, I\u2019d like to preface by saying that I always have this vision of being a fictional character. I remember to have discussed this with you during our adolescence. \n\nHB: Yes. I called you crazy.\n\nIE: And rightfully so. Perhaps as a creator I am prone to surreptitious imagery and kaleidoscopic speculations, but I have images and visions so vivid that they could only be memories. As you may also remember, my natural ability and almost uncanny affinity to French literature, especially of Francophone accounts of North Africa, also troubled me with its emotionality. I think the fictional Isabelle should be born in Switzerland in the late 1870s, but I chose to kept the details of my Manchester upbringing in my manuscript.\n\nHB: Why such a choice?\n\nIE: To me it did not make much difference. The fictional Isabelle did not have an eventful life before she was eighteen; and so it does not matter where she stays so long as nothing happens. As I acquired much of my personal knowledge and curiosity through correspondence with others and later the Internet, I thought it fitting to put the fictional Isabelle within such an intellectual predicament that adventure only exists outside of her current reality. This compression, or rather repression, serves as an important creative motivation for both myself and the fictional Isabelle\u2026\n\nHB: You talk about your fictional doppelg\u00e4nger as if she was real.\n\nIE: I firmly believe that she is real, as I firmly believe in the fictitiousness of my own existence. I think of myself as a part of a soul she forgot to claim when she threw herself into the flood, and I long to unite with her.\n\n(cont.)", "created_at": "2020-03-16 14:43:35.563283", "updated_at": "2020-03-16 14:43:35.563283", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 403, "wiki": false, "reads": 24, "score": 19.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [1803], "is_liked_by": [401], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1848, "user_id": 144, "topic_id": 881, "post_number": 7, "raw": "(cont.)\n\nHB: So, about your childhood.

And you told me that you were trying to kill your mother.\n\nIE: (here she chuckles.) I don\u2019t really remember that, but I\u2019d buy it. That sounds like me.\n\nHB: Right. I was surprised you knew my name \u2014 you barely talked to anyone.\n\nIE: I guess I didn\u2019t really want to talk in school. Forgive me for being a philistine, but I guess the hubbub bored me. And plus, I was mortally afraid of the other kids. How much movement they commit on a daily basis! How animated! Everything moved quite too fast for me. I guess that\u2019s why I choose to live in stories.\n\nHB: No, I\u2019m sure you saw right through us.\n\nIE: Even if I did, I wouldn\u2019t be able to change anything.

We took biscuits and tea on the patio, facing the lake.)\n\nHB: Why did you hate your mother?\n\nIE: To very simply put it, she\u2019s a whore. Now that they\u2019re all dead, I\u2019m legally allowed to talk about them without consequence. Everyone thought she was a very good housewife, but she goes out to meet men at nights and she leaves us a part of her secret, me and my sisters. I am not blaming her \u2014 or slut shaming her. I\u2019m simply expressing my disdain for her ambition. You cannot both have sexual liberation and a stable family, at least when I was growing up. She didn\u2019t want to choose, so she left us all miserable.\n\nHB: Any protagonist of your novels would claim these social constructs to be obscenities.\n\nIE: My characters may do so because they were powerful enough to change said constructs, Holly. My mother was not. She was frankly quite stupid and powerless in society. When you are stupid and powerless, you play by the rules. \n\nHB: Would you like to share \u2014 any especially ugly moments that came to mind?\n\nIE: Holly, you\u2019re beginning to sound like a gossip columnist.

Mallory had sent the location upon leaving, but he had forgotten about it.  The faint pulse of the message indicator had alerted him to it. He had been imagining what Mallory wanted, a kind of mental exercise to help allay the anxiety. After the receipt of the location, his anxiety was amplified. \n\n*Jesus Christ. What the hell is this ABOUT? I need context but I doubt I'll get it from her.*\n\n11808 S. Rigon Plaza. The number was of no real significance, but the *name* \"Rigon Plaza\" was as loud an alarm as could be rung, an air-raid siren in the confines of his brain, too loud for rational thought, an adrenaline spike, his animal instincts yelling \"RUN. NOW.\"\n\nIt took some time to calm down. Jimmy had to will his paranoia to a back corner. He needed to think about this. *What the fuck could this be about? Since the riots, Rigon Plaza is maybe the most surveilled location in the city, hell, maybe even the country.* He eased onto the corner of the bed, his hands tapping nervously against the sleek, metallic case of his devvie.  \n\n*I gotta see Syn. He'll have some theories. Hopefully, the channel is still open.*\n\n\"Private mode.\" The VA beeped in recognition of the command. Jimmy activated his devvie's music playlist and set the volume to full, and placed it on top of the VA. He then covered them both with a t-shirt.\n\nJimmy took the Stallman out from its hasty hiding spot and retreated into the bathroom. He flicked the power button slide, garnering a faint hum from the Stallman. The top of the line in anonymous connection, illegal nearly everywhere. Its screen faded into light, the blue-green glow somehow calming, reassuring. \n\n\"Alright, Syn. Let's see if you're in stream. I need ya, buddy.\"\n\nJimmy's fingers manipulated the GUI with practiced ease, like a pianist or a sculptor, his medium the stream of intersecting communication networks, hundreds of millions of them, that connected humans and AI in the world's marketplace and communication network. Though in and of itself lawless, the USE of certain parts of it was illegal and carried significant consequences, to the tune of three to five years for even *accessing* it. \n\nJimmy was a practiced hand, like most of his generation. He grew up during the period before government monitoring and enforcement. He and most of his peers had adapted seamlessly to the shadows, familiar as they were to them, kids seeking pornography or drugs or whatever other illegal or uncouth things they didn't want Mom and Dad knowing about. They circumvented parental controls with ease, and the government controls weren't much different. It was a kind of skill one developed as a kid that is just *instinctive*, like swimming. The poor swimmer can drown in the network. \n\nThe familiar logo of The Sense Parlor appeared on his screen, orange and yellow, lurid and undeniable. He swiped the \"Subscription\" icon, revealing the contacts list. Ostensibly and practically, The Sense Parlor was a legal marijuana dispensary. However, it was merely a front for back-channel communications. There was a complex code system required for communication with those who knew, a sort of substitution cipher of code words in specific phrasing. \n\n*I was hoping to get some of the Stellar but it is out of stock. Any idea when it will be back in stock?* \n\nJimmy hit send and waited. Reflexively, he popped some speed. The Mallory thing was eating at his mind, its tendrils of fear poking at him. It took effort to fight them. He had played the game back in the day, a low-level access man, providing street level connections for the uninitiated. Mostly, his \"clients\" had been tax-cheats looking for shadow-economy transactions. He took a percentage for his efforts, usually around three percent, then turned around and bought speed and 'loop, the scene drugs of choice, which could be easily unloaded for cash. \n\nThe only reason he had the catering job was to provide cover - until the Clampdown. Now, that was nearly the only income he had, excepting a few trusted return clients. Street level stuff was too damn dangerous since the Bounty System Bill had been enacted. Jimmy had watched a shitload of access guys get painted by their clients, most never to be seen again. They were quietly arraigned and shipped off to the Factory, a government manufacturing facility loosely disguised as a prison. Jimmy had been lucky. \n\nThe Stallman chimed a notification. Jimmy clicked the inbox and read the message: *Temporary condition. More available from our sister-site, Green Gables. Please allow three to four weeks.* \n\n\"Thank you, Syn! Fuck, I need you , man.\" \n\nThe code was a simple one: *Temporary* meant \"understood\"; *Green Gables* was their code for a hash bar in Center City; *three to four weeks* was a time, in this case 3+4+ 7; *weeks* was postmeridian. \n\nJimmy turned the Stallman off and put it in its usual hiding spot, a narrow, insulated slot he had cut into the wall below the ventilation access. He threw on some reasonably-clean pants and his Taylors, pocketed some speed, and grabbed his jacket and mask on the way out the door. \n\n*Time to tug the string and see what unravels.* \n\nThe hallway smelled like piss. Jimmy tightened his mask and stepped over Curt, fast asleep in the hallway, again. His devvie was still entertaining his VA. He wasn't going to need it until after Syn, but more importantly, Syn would probably stab him if he knew it was with him. \n\n*When you have three or four friends in the whole world, you better keep 'em happy.*", "created_at": "2020-06-10 16:52:42.677208", "updated_at": "2020-06-10 16:52:55.687269", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 965, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 3.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [2816], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3995, "user_id": 401, "topic_id": 1230, "post_number": 11, "raw": "My body prism\n\nWho is talking?\nWho is behind the MY of the body\nMy body \nMy prism\n\nDear body prism\nThat which is not one and is less than plenty.

She did them out of curiosity and for getting free movie tickets. It was a good deal because she loved to take her friends to movies and besides she could ask all of the nerdy scientists about what they were up to and why. \n\nEarlier that week she had done a \"non sleeping test\", where she had to stay awake for 48 hours. She had spent the night with a sleep-guard that poked her every-time she started to fall asleep while they were playing Tekken in the couch. The couch was too soft, she just pressed all of the buttons on the control as fast as she could. She came home afterwards sleeping 24 hours which she was quite exited about since it was her longest sleep ever. She felt like sleeping beauty in that moment only the creepy prince never arrived much to her delight. \n\nThe day before she had done a pain in the jaw test which was the worst one she ever tried. They injected some liquid into her jaw and then she just had to say how painful it was on a scale between 1-10. She always circled the ten. After this she had considered quitting doing these tests but wanted to give it some last tries. She was one to get back up on the horse once she fell.\n\nThe only thing she knew about this Saturdays test, was that it was about empathy. It was unusual for her to be early to an appointment but this time she was and got terribly confused with what to do with that extra time. She tried to work on her telepathic skills on a plant sitting next to her. It didn't look all that good, it looked kinda dry and she was intensely trying to heal it by thinking wet thoughts when she got interrupted by the man that she later figured out was her doctor for the test. He was drop dead gorgeous, not dry at all but looked rather moisturized. He had luscious lips and swaying grey hair in the wind. His eyes were all squeaky and mysterious. His tight pants wrapped around his thighs and accentuated his firm and peachy ass. He was a creature of the gods she thought to herself. \n\nHe said hi and she could trace a certain flirty tone in his voice. She was a self declared expert of the flirting game, and would teach all her friends her tricks on any given occasion. \n\n-\"Are you Kim?\" He asked with a dark deep voice and a Portugese accent. They shook hands and his hand felt soft, smooth and hairy against hers, almost like the paw of a kitten. He said to follow her and she gladly did and started to sing the Lykke Li song a bit louder than she had expected but didn't mind because her singing voice was like that of an angel. \u201dI I FOLLOW, I FOLLOW YOU, DEEP SEA BABY!\u201d \n\nThey walked down empty halls and he was unlocking door after door.  He was disabling the security systems of the building, she stood behind him still singing and memorized the security codes just in case. She had visual memory so she just did not look away when he typed in the codes, and he didn't try to hide them with that usual cupped hand from her either, which she took as a sign of the mutual trust that they already established. \n\nWhen they reached their trial room he unlocked the door and as he did she leaned in closer to smell him a little bit, he smelled like cactuses and something expensive she had forgotten the name of. Inside was a projector, two chairs, a medical bed and a machine that gives electrical shocks.

But then again, some part of me didn\u2019t seem to mind at all.\n[/quote]\n\nOat and I met a couple of years ago. He's a friend of Kassie's and Kassie is my ex. Quirky, yet pleasant blonde who went to school with me, who introduced me to the city and to all of the perks of living on your own. She's the one that taught me how to cook, how to pay bills, how to avoid getting in trouble. We had good times, Kassie and I, but after a while it just collapsed. I think many couples are familiar with the same pattern: crazy love, sex and passion, then stabile times, then boredom and last, but not least, frustration and this strange habit of blaming your partner for your own mess. I suppose that's how the world spins when you're in your early 20s.\n\nI didn't think about Oat too much when I was with Kassie. He was that strange, yet sharp-minded kid that always seemed to be hiding something. He just had that aura, you know. But when we moved in together, I kinda began to like him. He's a good roommate, tidy, quiet. I never thought I could *like* like him, you know. But that couch thing made me think.\n\nAfter a couple of days we were chilling on the same couch and watching The Affair. You know, that show about a writer that cheats on his wife with some waiter, and every episode is made of 2 different perspectives? Like, first you see the dude's story, then you see the same thing, but from his lover' perspective. Oat made a funny comment. He said: Your cheeks remind me of Joshua Jackson. And he winked. Oat never does that. He doesn't flirt, he doesn't wink. But the weirdest part is \u2013 it didn't seem strange at all. He looked natural, as if he was washing hands by repeating a series of little movements his body memorized through the years.\n\nAnd I?

It  simply existed among the cacophony of hues and smells.\n\nStrange as it was, this flower received torrents of stinging words, slander and defamation. \"You bizarre specie\"; \"You're as rigid as a mountain\"; and, most annoyingly, \"You will never have a name.\" Even the sun deemed it too tough for its own good, and the clouds though she was undeserving of their tears. But this rock-grown flower knew better than to feel sorry for itself.\n\n\nThe rocky flower grew weary and disheartened. It wished death upon itself, yet how can death bend the life of a rock? At that instant of absolute sorrow, the wind blew from all four corners. The flowers around began to dance, cackling softly and making of the outcast, \"What are you, deaf? Can't you hear the wind singing?\" Yet the flowers were too busy flaunting their petals and thorns, that they'd misread the message the wind had been carrying. A change was coming: the season was overturning.  \n\nFall came howling through the trees, and all the flowers died. They undressed themselves and wilted against the power of the climate. Yet our flower remained solid, standing upright, receiving rain and sunshine with a brazen spirit. It waited four long seasons before it could meet its abusers again; and, just as they bloomed again, the lampooning resumed. \"You're still alive!\" they all laughed in unison. \n\nThis did not bother the rocky flower. For it knew something the others didn't. The flower they mocked had witnessed the change of the seasons, and they did not. Their pride hindered them from understanding that that same flower they hated knew a life that revolted against itself, a sun emasculated by the moon, a drought that made mountains burst in rivers of tears, and a breeze that taught a gust of wind how to serenade a broken heart.\n\nThe flower that grew out of a rock knew all this.

This is something he has never mentioned to me and I have been forbidden from asking about. Although I have the capability in my mental make up to leg go of this unexplored thread I sometimes, and always alone, allow myself to indulge in how the conversation might go.

I do this through my brother in law, always with wine and his wife and our exchanges have always spread out over the years. I know that my inlaws are pious. Their daily prayers, their prayer ceremonies and all the associated side dishes that come with it are a clear message without my brother in law having to tell me. But I always want to know what drives these things. He told me about a \"divine intervention\" that happened to them shortly after they were married. This intervention turned a death-situation into a near-death-situation. An important distinction that allows our current conversations to exist and drove them to a life of servitude even if a sense of genuine belief may not actually be present. I cannot help but marvel at the ability of human nature to guilt people into bullshit.\n\nI am trying to unravel the family I married into. I do this through my brother in law, always with wine and his wife and our exchanges have always spread out over the years.

I find it fascinating and not all that different to my own conservative upbringing albeit with more chili and even more frightening restrictions on contact with the opposite sex.

It makes me proud of us.\n\nI am trying to unravel the family I married into. I do this through my brother in law, always with wine and his wife and our exchanges have always spread out over the years. Oftentimes I find that they are just like any other family I am close enough to know. Filled with insecurities, abnormality and chaos. Frequently concerns about money and social standing. At once I wanted to blurt out how money can be the root of all evil. But when a family starts out with nothing but a cow-shit hut in the deep countryside of India and has grafted hard enough to own comfortable flats in big cities, their own cars and travel the world you realise that you would sound like a dick and that perhaps my understanding of money and life is a little off.\n\nI am trying to unravel the family I married into. I do this through my brother in law, always with wine and his wife and our exchanges have always spread out over the years. Our final exchange was about the challenge of acceptance for my marriage to his brother. It was a considerable stretch for such a conservative family (conservative and yet expecting their children to study at top institutions across the globe without ever expanding their mindset beyond the small village they all hail from, yeah, it constantly flummoxes me too). Acceptance always felt surface level to me and, so, it was a relief (of sorts) to hear that what my instincts told me was true. \n\nI no longer try to unravel the family I married into.

Proportion can only come from perspective, and in times of great agony, only rest will prolong it. The man was easily tracked by his trail, a gory Ariadne. They were thankful that he did not bleed on something important, I remember. The consequence of human blood, spilling, almost too regretful to even contemplate.

On ordinary days of plentiful hair and loose blouses that I wore outside my slacks, because American clothes never kept Indian hips in mind, the car simply felt old and smelled like Lin's perfume. Tonight, even the smell of her Vera Wang perfume added to the style of the evening. I knew people would smell it when we pulled up at the club.

Did I accidentally smoke too much weed last night and suffer a psychosis? Have I finally lost it? \n\nThe magpie, for its part, seemed nonplussed by the gaping woman, comically bent over the still-running faucet, her cotton panties in a firm wedgie, as was likely her grasp on reality. \n\n\u201cNo time for gloominess, Miss Lila.

It seems that he has bashed his head against the wall of data presented on his dual monitor setup. Characters and codes arranged in a complex network in the NetRaider interface, a three-dimensional representation of the infinite-dimensional interactions of all meanings held between Beans and the other 17 players. \n\nIt had only been a few iterations before he had seen through the conceit that he was somehow in a privileged position. It wouldn't make any sense given that the physical constraints were all the same. Obviously all 18 participants were being played while at the same time trying to play everyone else. \n\nIn order to make his plan he would have to use the data presented to him, make a coherent plan and pitch to sell the others on for the game he wanted to play. To win the prize. There could be only One, and all that. But in order to do that he would have to map out and build relationships between not just him and the other 17, but also between all of them. And that's where a by now *very* familiar feeling that was driving him up the wall had begun hounding him. The feeling of being a puny primate entirely inadequate for the task. \n\nThe number of relationships in a group scales to (N*(N-1))/2. In a group of 18 there is thus 153 relationships between two people. And a much larger number of cliques possible within it. Dunbar's number, the suggested cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships, is approximately 150. Beans does not think this correlation is coincidence. It's obviously by design, to put him and the others at their cognitive limit. But what game is the designer playing at? And more importantly, what's their endgame?\n\nA cash incentive will only go so far. Eventually, primates will always seek companionship with each other. We're hardwired to.

Some sort of rebuke against meteorology and as if she felt it really ought to be precisely how *she* wished it.\n\nShe was right though. The weather today could be described as 'more than a little inclement'. The rain had started in the night. a low drizzle that gave off a hum on the ancient slate tiles. The drizzle had slowly surrendered to rain that was heavier, more urgent and perhaps a touch angry and the hum turned into an intricately unplanned percussion of loud taps all along the roof of my room. \nMy room was up in the eaves of the house. Despite there being many other suitable rooms on the first floor I was to be in the eaves. I heard Pearl say it to the Housekeeper, Mrs Pelham, the day I arrived;\n\"Ma'am I 'ave prepared the small room on the east side. It's everso little and will like suit a small one well an' she'll not b' far from you\"\n\"No, Mrs Pelham, put her on the north side in the eaves. She can use the servants staircase at the back. I shall not have her poking her nose through the first floor where it doesn't belong\"\n\nI didn't see the exchange, and I was only seven, but I know Mrs Pelham's actions were only filled with kindness for me given the reason I had come to be in this place. \nAt first my room in the eaves seemed really quite sinister and frightening to me. The sharp rise and fall of the roof joists creating their angular pattern across most of the space that I had. I have since grown to love the shadows cast beyond the wood and onto the felt lining. A sort of visual ode to tessellation with all its triangles and rectangles sitting perfectly next to each other. I had a neat, single bed with simple wooden frame and lumpy mattress had so many blankets on top of it that I had no idea how I would breath underneath them all. A small window, perhaps a foot by a foot and a half punctuated the harsh, flat, dark triangle at the far end and revealed to me the most spectacular views across the Yorkshire Dales. But on the first day arrived it looked to me as though it was the smallest possible handkerchief of access to the real world I would be allowed, and beyond it the grey autumn day thrashed a wind like a cat of nine tails against it. The floor was uneven and creaked at every step. Boards in the roof not given any concern to who might stand upon them, certainly not Miss Pearl. I don't think she ever set foot above the first floor. One small fireplace, my refuge and joy on long winter nights. Staring into the infinity of the flames and feeling their warmth and love of being watched in return. I would sit (and still do) on the old servants kitchen chair. Mrs Pelham had thoughtfully put a cushion on it for me.\n\n\nNow fourteen and taller and not (as yet) beaten down by Pearl's endless passive-aggressive attacks and unsubtle gas lighting efforts to drive me to something I was starting to feel my own sense of independence. My own mind was my own. And so was my room in the eaves. I love and adore every inch of it now. If the inclement weather isn't working its magic on the slates outside then I heart the creatures of the house scuttling about between the felt and the tiles. Their little claws making such delicate sounds. My handkerchief view is my canvas for all and the fields, tress, streams, rocks and sky that meet my eyes calms and excites me all at once. It would be fair to say that I have grown inordinately fond of this place. I may pause at laying a claim to a fondness for Miss Pearl. That would not be correct. But the rest is an absolute joy.\n\n\"Yes\" I hear my voice say, \"It certainly is an inclement situation, would you like me to call Green and ask him to light the fire early Miss Pearl, perhaps we could play cards?\"\nQuite senseless. I hear my voice saying these things out loud. It is all *so* disingenuous and I really felt I could resent it for that, if resentment was something worth anyone's time. Pandering to Miss Pearl.

She thinks about her time in-between-us and how the space she took up. She takes moments to pause to delight in the pleasures of writing. She is a content creator, who makes for an audience and always trying to find ways to heal her home.

She feels fucking grateful to the strange northerners who are cool in ways that make her want to be their friend. She feels so much love for herself and happy she made it this far. She is playful and experimental and allows herself to make mistakes and has a lightness about her serious work that has offered some hope. \n\nThe day is safe, but come Monday, when the short-term rental ends and the booking agency learns that we are occupying the house in protest and solidarity with all the occupations that are sprouting in informal settlements, she knows the safety ends too.

Despite their ceaseless attempts, the couple was not able to conceive another child. It was during the third year that they realized something was wrong. Goldie's calendar was a combination of monthly check-marks, pinning down the best days for conception. To no avail, however. A few check-ups at the doctor and tests at the clinic concluded that Rump was sterile. Ultimately, the couple grew apart. \n\nGoldie had picked up on a hobby she had long forgotten: writing. Rump, on the other hand, got involved in more and more black dealings. It wasn't that he became wayward or that he returned to his old ways, but something's gotta give when two lovers resent each other, thereby rendering their marriage nominal. All the riches of Rump's backstreet trade did nothing but thinly cover the elephant in the room.\n\nThat was true, as true as it can be, until one day, as Goldie was finalizing the third chapter's draft, she received a call from a private number.\n\n\"Hello?\" she said, wondering who it was. \n\nA baritone voice responded. \"Is this the Locks-Gold residence?\"\n\n\"Who's asking?\" Goldie did not want to sound alarmed. \n\n\"Is this Goldie Locks?\"\n\nGoldie raised her voice. \"Who's asking? Who's on the phone?\"\n\nA silence followed this question, at which point Goldie was going to hang up with an infuriating touch of her thumb. But the voice spoke again.\n\n\"I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Listen, I don't have time for this. You either tell me who you are or I'm going to hang up. Don't consider calling this number again.\"\n\n\"Wait, wait! Wait,\" the voice trailed off. \"I'm... This is Sam Flanders.\"\n\n\"And who's that supposed to be?\"\n\nAnother pause, and then: \"Your son.\"\n\nThe last two words pulled the carpet out from under Goldie's feet. Her son? She had a son? \n\n\"I've... No. Whoever you are, this is a very mean joke.\" Goldie hung up on the voice as it struggled to say something. \n\nLater that day, when Rump returned from one of his business trips, Godlie related to him what had happened. At first, she wanted to keep it a secret, but she figured if the marriage was dull enough as it was, she might as well just be honest. After she was done, Rump only stared ahead, motionless. \n\n\"What is it, Rump?\" she asked. \"Do you know this person?\"\n\nRump slowly moved his head to her direction. His adam's apple bounced as he took a large gulp. \n\n\"Goldie,\" he whispered. \"Goldie, this is... this is not your child. This is my son. The son I gave up to Afreet. The one I conceived with whats-her-name?\"\n\nGoldie's eyes bulged out in brusque realization. \"Moll?\" \n\n\"Moll, Moll,\" Rump rolled the name with his tongue.\n\nGoldie was confused. \"Why is he calling? What do you think he wants? Wasn't there a deal?\"\n\nRump fell into a pensive mood; Goldie was insistent. \n\n\"What happened, Rump?\"\n\n\"I think,\" Rump drawled, \"I think there was a breach. A deal is only valid if everything is intact.\" \n\nHe suddenly rose form his seat and left. \"Where are you going?\" Goldie urged. \n\n\"Nowhere.\"\n\nRump disappeared.\n...\n\nAfreet stood with his legs spread wide apart. He had a gun in his hand, and from the other end of the gun's barrel, was a boy in his late teens. \n\n\"Happy fucking birthday,\" Afreet hissed. \n\n\"Please don't do this,\" the boy pleaded.\n\n\"Shut your trap, hybrid.\"\n\n\"Please, please, I'll do anything, just don't----\"\n\n\"I SAID SHUT YOUR FUCKING TRAP.\"\n\nThe boy lowered his head. Afreet continued. \n\n\"Master Kaggen wants you to call him.\"\n\n\"What if doesn't recognize me?\" the boy whimpered.\n\nAfreet chuckled. \"Just say your name. He'll know what's up.\"\n\nThe boy with quivering hands dialed the number Afreet had written to him on a slip of paper. The phone gave a few beeps before finally connecting.\n\n\"Hello? Hello? This is... This is Sam Flanders.\" The boy wept uncontrollably, but a push from the gun's muzzle motivated him to collect himself. \n\n\"Dad, I'm your son. I'm your son.

He wasn't perfect but he had never abused her or been unfaithful or any such things that they often talked about on the subreddits. \n\nShe had just walked out of their life. He knew Penny had moved to a different country and started a new life there. He knew it was somewhere with a beach and that she was teaching people surfing, or yoga or something. He'd gathered that from the friends she still held contact with. She'd even told them not to tell Adam where she'd moved but that he hadn't done anything. Some of them was as bewildered as he was.\n\nThe first months after he'd been convinced that something had happened to her and it was then that one of her friends broke their silence. He felt that given his inclination to solve mysteries it had been an especially cruel joke and for some time had tried to contact her and tell her off. But the anger abated and he was left for a while with a gaping hole in his stomach instead.\n\n10 years later now and Adam had found his way to move on. He'd come to terms with the fact that he wouldn't understand fully. And in the darker hours of the night, under the influence of heavy red wine and Miles Davis, he had figured that it had probably been their inertia, that Penny had seen a life with him going forward that wasn't suited to her. Tapping along to \"Freddie freeloader\" with one finger on one of the ridiculously large glasses of 5 year old Nebbiolo they served him at \"The pianists demise\", he could see her point. She had always loved the coasts yet they had settled down in the city, with its river sure, but it was nothing you'd surf or even swim in if you wanted to keep yourself healthy.

If he left you that way he may not be capable of giving you closure however hard you seek it.\" He said kindly and before she could beg him for it anyway he continued, \"And the revenge angle isn't healthy either. Look, I'm not going to lie, it's going to take some time getting over that douchebag. The best way is actually just to get all the shit that reminds you of him out of the way and then just trying to live your best life ok?

It is postulated that the machinery depicted here had been transported by Swammerdam to Amsterdam, as a little peek at his laboratory, to entice investors.\"\n\nThe projected image was a disturbing one, its eeriness enhanced by its ragged, unfinished quality, the background still merely swathes of black paint, with a few inchoate furnishings of the room scratched over the void in chalk. A shadowed figure, bent over the table, remained featureless. Only the machinery had any detail to it: a collection of glassware and candles, dominated by a central jar packed full of bees.

With little else to do and no reason to get home and craving event, I stepped through the gate. It smelt damp and the tunnel led to dark green and soft shadows.

The way-stones were a number of unassuming blocks of black weathered granite that marked, supposedly, where the domain of the valley folk ended and the kingdom of the forest began. The older folk in the valley rarely ventured into the woods and while the Norfun forest to the north was a day travel they always went there instead of into the F\u00e9folc for timber.

I was raised in the capital, Beirut, where everyone fights to preserve their own shadow. Such drama, you'd think. Indeed, it may be a tad dramatic. Why should I overstate myself on a forum that already holds the bulk of the words I've produced for the past half a year? I can think of many answers to this one, but the chief one would be the following: simply, to tell myself\u2014and the world\u2014that if I ever leave unannounced, the traces of my presence are stowed somewhere. Words are the imprint that do not fade over time and age. Having said that, I can safely move to my thoughts on writing, of which I lack much experience, young as I am.\n\nIt is odd to be facing a blankness that is not a white page. It's a black screen with contrasting white characters that shoot forward in tandem with the speed of my thoughts. I've thus seen myself mirrored in inverted colours. For the past six months, my fingers have buckled, tapped, and drummed against  my laptop's keyboard. I remember the first time a fellow applicant responded to my very first contribution: my heart grew to the size of the ocean and swelled like an impertinent tide. That feeling harboured months ago maintained itself throughout. Ergo, my hands hovered over the stolid alphabetic keys with much virulence and liveliness. \n\nThe world around, however, had changed without much consent or warning. What used to be a familiar landscape chipped like broken china: gradually at first, then altogether. Breathing and keeping alive became a task. Words wilted in my heart and they died on my fingertips. As I write this\u2014letter?\u2014down, a string of fresh memories flashes before me, superimposed against a blinking cursor. Have you ever been shoved into a rabbit hole, fell, then found yourself in a world that functioned differently? I hope not. And honestly, I don't want to get into the details.\n\nTonight, I leave this forum. The well from which I extracted most of my words has run dry. My pen lies limp next to me, my notebook untouched, and my can of beer as empty as my pack of cigarettes. I look out the window of the studio house I've moved in recently, and I can discern the cracks on the opposite building, the aftermath of August 4's explosion. What poetry can be written with such a sight? What stories can be written? Many, I'd say. But not imminently. For now, there is grief that has not been processed yet, the kind that bemuses you three joints into the night. All lacerations need time to heal; but first, they need to be stitched carefully. \n\nFor now, however, I am content with what I have. My youth dreads a future basked in foreboding. What's going to happen to me, to us? Am I ever going to have a name of my own written in capital letters on a passport? This may sound like gibberish to you, and honestly, thank your lucky stars that this sounds confusing. Literature, after all, is supposed to throw you off guard, isn't it? Well, is it? I wonder. \n\nWhat you need to know is this: Somewhere out there, a certain somebody has the song 'Spirits' by The Strumbellas playing on repeat.\n\n*I got guns in my head and they won't go\nSpirits in my head and they won't go\nI got guns in my head and they won't go\nSpirits in my head and they won't go*\n\nIt's time to go now.

The locals never really gave them much interest and didn't really bother making them feel welcomed. \n\nAt the very same moment, they both had a similar idea. Perhaps they could find what they were looking for with another tourist and so they downloaded the app. Their's was the first profile to pop on the other's screen and they matched. it seemed almost destined, like it was being written by some divine force. \n\nRumpelstilskin was a bit unsure of his identity. He was an alchemist. That much he was sure of (and his gender for now) but what he really longed for was some Aryan looking goddess to validate his self worth and fall hopelessly in love with him. \n\nGoldie Locks wanted a home and a family.  As a child, she longed for it so much that she thought she could magically manifest it into being.  She was wrong, that much she was sure of (for now). Her therapist had convinced her of this, after many iterations of the same advice, warning her from seeking shelter in the woods. \n\nThere first date was a true fairy tale and quickly Rumpelstilskin built a home of gold for them in the center of the city. They married the same day in the courtyard and became King and Queen of the land. Their dreams had come true. They found love in a hopeless place.  But like most whirlwind romances, they didn't spend enough time getting to know each other well enough and expected that for the first time the fates were working in their favour. How naive. \n\nGoldie Locks spend most of her days inspecting her newly built home. At first this filled Rumpelstilskin with joy. He was a proud craftsman. But slowly, and with an accuracy that seemed implausible, she offered critique and Rumples (as Goldie Locks had decided was a more fitting name) was compelled to make amends. \n\nAnd so for a decade, Rumples spent his days following Goldie Locks around obeying her commands while she refurbished the house. He soon tired and turned his attention to food. He didn't know she was a foodie as well. \n\nGoldie Locks, so obsessed with her dream home had no interest in sex. Eventually Rumples demanded a child. His manhood was being questioned consistently and he longed for a child who would love him instead. \n\nGoldie, whose heart was usually locked, stiffened at the proposed invasion of her body.  She had designed the house for a child, but hoped instead to be treated like a child, with everything catered just right to her. \n\n\"No this idea was too too bad,\" she thought but could not find the words to explain it to Rump which she started calling him after his demand for a child. \n\nRump, still in love, was willing to cut a deal, find a way to make it all work. They had never discussed their pasts in proper detail, but perhaps there was some reason she did not want to have a child that she was struggling to talk to him about. Secretly, he stalked her profiles until he found some clues about where she grew up. That night he told her about his concerns for her and asked to meet her parents. \n\nThe walls of Goldie's heart started to crack and her locks were about to stop working. \n\nGoldie was an albino.

Birds talking - my professors knew it was theoretically possible, after all parrots are able to vocalize sounds that humans find understandable.

Her words are scattered but they show some understanding of context. It will be interesting to see what she will be able to do in the next few weeks or months. \n\nFirstly, I understand that there are still tests to run but I am anxious to see the data. Compile everything you have and send it to me; I will get back to you on forthcoming experiments once you are getting close to the end of the current cycle of tests. \n\nI recommend that in your spare time, you speak more to her. Even better, put her in a room with a TV and let it go overnight. Allow her to absorb language even outside of experiments. See if that improves her understanding. Don't think too much about what media you're feeding her - it's all about the language - but considering that, nothing with too much swearing and violence!

The pack had known John had had some kind of trouble he was fleeing from, hell, he'd said as much when he came looking for them, but they hadn't looked to much into it. They had decided that they would deal with it when and if it came back to haunt him. They just hadn't thought it would happen so soon.\n\n\"What did he do?\" Richard found himself asking, kicking at the sand underneath the swing. The park was a smart move, it was neutral \"don't fucking-touch-this-ground\", all the clans and the cabals and the covens would be out for blood if they heard two werewolves had duked it out at lunch in a public playground even if they were the only people in it at the time. In here, during daytime, they couldn't touch him.\n\n\"He killed some important people down south,\" the man said, \"I don't know the full details, I don't really care to be honest, but he off-ed some witch's son and at least one vampire.

On the one hand, you did us a favour, on the other, we will look weak if we let one of our own, even one at fault, be killed without repercussion.\"\nThey sat there in silence for a while as a trickle of families entered the playground. \n\"Looks like time is up\" the man said.\n\"Yeah\" Richard sighed as he saw a family coming towards the swing set, \"I'll cut give you a deal, if you head into the woods over there, I'll duel you for this, a proper Holmgaang and if you win you go free, no hard feelings. If you try to run, we will have to track you down.\"\nThe man stood up, smiled at the family as he took his duffel bag and nodded at Richard who also stood up from his swing. \n\"No hard feelings.\" The man said.\n\"None, Moon's honour.\" Richard said.\nThe man nodded and then walked away in the directions of the woods.\n\n---", "created_at": "2020-05-29 09:47:12.651396", "updated_at": "2020-06-09 10:34:21.237949", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 638, "wiki": false, "reads": 23, "score": 14.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4313, "user_id": 144, "topic_id": 1301, "post_number": 4, "raw": "My family had no ambition, no excellence, no excessive suffering.

Don't you dare show up,\u201d Sophy\u00e1 hissed, which was of course when the doorbell rang.\n \nJeff was on his feet and flying towards the door before he registered it, Gak close on his heels. He was only faster for the fae was reluctant to push their liege aside. As soon as he threw himself against the doorknob, Gak planted a palm firmly into the middle of the door and pushed. The heavy wood shuddered. Hinges creaked. Jeff threw himself onto Gak's arm but it was like tackling a steel pole. Breath shoved out of his lungs. It seemed impossible to stop him. Fabe's demise was impending.\n \n\"I'm here,\" Fabe announced cheerfully from outside, and swung the door wide open.\n \nGak lifted their arm and shook Jeff off as though he was a child. Their claws went slashing towards Fabe\u2019s poor face. Sophya screamed. Gary shielded the children. The girl peered over his shoulder. \n\nFabe blocked the blow with a trumpet case. Or, he tried to. The claws sunk through the leather and steel like butter, and would have kept going through to Fabe\u2019s shocked face when there was a loud crackle and then a sizzling smell filled the air, burnt hair and flesh and gasoline. \n \nGak reared back as though burnt; perhaps they were burnt for a strange smoke was wafting silvery and noxious from their hand. From within the ruined trumpet case shines a thick gleam of silver.\n\n\"That wasn't very nice!\" Fabe chided, in a lazy sort of drawl. Unwary of the fresh attempt on his life, he squatted down and tugged from the remnants of the case, a silver rapier.\n\n\u201cFae silver,\u201d Gak gasped. They took a step back from the strangely shimmering weapon. \"You should not be able to touch that, swamp creature!\"\n \n\"What? Nah man, I'm human. You must've mistaken\u2026 this!\" With a smug little smirk, Fabe pulled a leather cord out from under his collar. On it hung a blood red jewel that, spinning lightly with momentum, turned out to be an eye with a slitted pupil.\n \n\u201cThat is the eye of a swamp demon,\u201d Gak's brow furrowed and they stared at Fabe with bewilderment. \u201cA most rare and powerful object of warding. How did you come across such a thing?\u201d\n \n\"Carved it right out of its head. Cool right? Didn't even have to preserve it, just water it now and then.\"\n\nWhen Jeff turned to exchange baffled looks, Sophy\u00e1 just shrugged, unmoved by her brother's antics. \"You've seen him with a kitchen knife.\"\n\n\"The eye's trippy, my dudes. When I stare into it, I got all tingly all over and cool shit starts to happen. I kinda like it.\" There was always something flighty and inscrutable about Fabe's smiles, but now it was out in full force. Reality didn't seem to have good grasp on him, and the eye's gentle swing from his outstretched hand almost hypnotised its audience, but Fabe jerked it back and tucked it securely under his shirt. Patting it with satisfaction, he raised his other arm, offering the silver sword out to Jeff. \"Here, you take the pokey stick instead.\"\n\nWhen Jeff wrapped his fingers around the sleek hilt of the rapier, the elegant weapon seemed to gleam with mysterious power. There was a thrumming in his heart that radiated softly with unspoken magic. \n\nJeff raised his rapier in front of him, then realised with a start that he was standing at the lead of a half-circle of strange and wonderful companions.

Even so, he couldn't escape the notion. He thought he really might become a communist just by looking at them, if he only tried harder. But his education and habits were too bourgeois and it was not expected that a man of his age would easily deny himself the cozy and carefree life he was used to. The position of a sales agent in a company that distributes care skin products didn't bring him millions, but he had some savings that he inherited when his parents died, and they also left him an apartment in city center. It wasn't much, but it was enough to think of one's life as a life of convenient existence. Among other things, his lifestyle enabled him to write. But come to think of it, quitting writing might be a better idea; words put him in this strange situation where he has to explain to these armed rebels he is not one of them and that it would be great if they would just let him go.\n\nNestor's poem was published this Wednesday in a literary magazine. It was a poem about a beatiful red flower (a poppy, perhaps, but he wasn't completely sure) that Nestor noticed when he was buying salad at a marketplace. This magazin (*Poetry* was the name) was popular only among poetry enthusiasts, and the poem wasn't even that good. For goodness' sake, it was a mere description of a flower, and God knows flowers don't support revolutions. On Saturday they knocked on his door, put him in the car and brought him to this dump, God knows where. 'I am not a communist, trust me! I would be a lousy one, trust me'.

A particularly wet and annoying girl. She was skinny and averagely attractive, wearing jeans in that low slung way that makes all 'normal' people want to give them a tug to simply demonstrate that they are incorrectly placed. Normally the prevail of guys rather than girls but she insisted this was her 'look'.  Dark hair strewn in ways across her face that made no sense and were not becoming. More as though a hair tarantula had gotten its legs into a serious tangle and was hanging from the top of her head. She was not Cheryl's ideal partner and Cheryl knew that but Cheryl saw the relationship as her opportunity to hone how to be with another person so that she could get it right when that person did come along. She would end it in a few months when she had sufficiently bolstered her encyclopedia and was not longer learning much. \n\nHowever.\n\nHer girlfriend called it first with the (shock) news that she had met someone else and, well, while this had been fun it was never serious and all the best and it's not you it's me.....\n\nThis left Cheryl shocked.

Part time!*\n*Your dad works for myyyyyyyyyy dad and YOU'RE GONNA WORK FOR ME!\"*\n\nIt cheered her up enough to make it into the office with a resolve that was stronger than before.

The guard did not know this, he did not care much for foreigners and even if he did, he'd likely not be able to make out the reference. \n\nMore importantly though, he could not sneeze because was on duty. There were crowds of people watching. People from all over the world, a rainbow of colours from very black to very white. A couple of shades in between. They were expecting him not to move a muscle.\n\nHe tensed his nose and tried very hard not to think about sneezing. He still had another four hours on duty. Fun fact: if one of the Queen's Guards has to go to the bathroom, he's supposed to 'relieve himself on the spot'. Breaking his duty is not an option. But would a quick sneeze really break character? What if he marched to the other sentry box, turned his back quickly and wiped the snot away? Maybe there would even be any snot! Genius! Oh wait. Oh no. Got to wait till both of us want to move. He almost thought out loud but luckily kept it silent. \n\nThe sun did not help the poor guard. It was a bright, bright sunny day in Central London and the light was shining right into his eyes. He could think of nothing other than having a nice big sneeze. Would probably entertain the crowd right? Before he became a guard, he was a comedian. Or at least, he'd like to think he was. It doesn't matter anymore, that was in a previous life. \n\n\"Hey!\" shouted a mildly foreign man from outside the gates. Was he Caribbean?  Indian? Was he actually foreign?

The images flashed by quickly.\n\nHe felt a sudden chill on his neck. He stopped and turned towards the palace.  \n\nThe energy around the gate was changing. The gesticulating man was shouting something that was inaudible to Anthony who was approximately fifty metres away.\n\nThe guard at the gate continued standing, stoic in his dedication to his position.\n\nThe crowd was beginning to disperse in a hurry.\n\nWithout warning, someone ran through the crowd towards the shouting man.

Most of them are now people I barely know anymore.\n\nBetween 11 and 12 I ran in a pack of boys that roamed the block I grew up in. But then, one day, as if we had rehearsed it for months, we all stopped calling one another. At times I see them as i walk in the city. We nod to each other, knowing that we no longer have anything to talk about.\n\nAs I became 13 I became one of the members of a merry band of nerds. This group expanded over the years, and then, as we eased our way slowly into adulthood, members left. To start families or careers or simply because they didn't have the time anymore. I remember them fondly although I would never lift up the phone to call them. And I still have friends from this group that I know today but we are now something more akin to family once removed. We keep tabs on each others life but we don't meet too often so that the starkness of our differences can be mollified by our shared nostalgia.\n\nAt 15 I joined a now lost crew of make-believers. We'd spend hours on end telling tales and I attribute much of my initial growth as a storyteller to that time. But as I reached 20 we drifted apart. I remember this bitterly quite as these were people close to me even then and I felt betrayed by them for not calling me back each time I tried to reach out. As I grew I recognized that they had had their own troubles and that I had been harsh in my anger. I met them quite recently on happenstance, for a big part of the group still gets together. I recognized them, the friends that once were are there deep inside of them and they have grown in ways I suspected may come to be. But that growth is perpendicular from mine so I left the chance meeting fast.\n\nA few years ago I was adopted into a coven of witches. And although I shift in and out of their lives we keep an almost daily contact. I don't know if we will drift apart, my experience tells me that we will. But then again, experience isn't beautiful for it's permanence.\n\nI do think that each of these groups filled a function in my life. Each with their foils and lancers and hearts. And each have made me grow.\n\nI don't think that the losses of these people could have been avoidable. Not with the road i have chosen for myself.\n\nMaybe that's the point?

Every day is a breath, opening up to life in the sun, basking in it, and settling down and closing in, vibrating with the night breeze. Every day is 365 breaths, in, out, growing and engaging in endless lively conversations with others through the mycelial channels that interpenetrates the whole forest. Every day there is a burst of sexual energy that erupts in seeds that are let go for life to propagate forward.  Some trees get to live just a twigful of days, others live as many as there are needles on a pine branch. There are instant changes as quick ones, animals, flicker and fly around the tree, sometimes pecking and digging and tearing off limbs, sometimes offering feces or bodies for nutrients to be shared along the mycelial channels. It all happens at a pace too fast to fathom, though sometimes there is a brief connection, when one of them stays long enough. \n\nThere is also an experience to being a forest. It is a feeling of being old with experience carried forward by billions of short-lived plant forms and supported by all other life. It is also vast and deep in scope and wisdom, a mind generated from countless interrelations between all the organisms within the nebulous bounds of its body, which is at times razed to the ground by fires, but is reborn as its primary body lives in the ground, its memory made consistent and proliferated in its mycelial structures and the epigenetics of their forms. Time is measured in centuries and millennia of tree years. Most forests are slow, but sometimes with really old forests untouched by humanity, their collossal consciousness give birth to a self-understanding that allows them to operate at the pace of animal life. Some perceptive humans look at these as spooky and haunted, and they would not be wrong.

But that experience is akin to the surface ripples on a deep forest lake. It is all he can consciously access, but like the forest, the visible part is only superficial phenomena. His true body lies beneath what his consciousness can access. It is a conversation happening across a network that interlinks all the beings in the world, internal as well as external to him.\n\nThe visible part of the forest is the limbic structure basking in the sun, the plants and animals and mushrooms. They support its true body, the mycelial network that runs through the Underland. The conversations between all the many beings are mediated through nutrients and matter sent across the fungal web. Rather than saying that the forest is the trees or the network between it, it is more true to say that the conversations really *are* the forest. What happens above is of consequence to the health of what happens below, and vice versa.\n\nSo it is with Narcissus. The self-destructive maelstrom that is his mind is a visible phenomenon arising from a war that is happening underneath the surface, a mass of conversations turned ugly, shaping and shaped by what he thinks of himself.\n\nThe central theme of this conflict is the disconnect between \nthe karmic seeds planted in him by most experiences he's had have grown into constant fear that he is not loved.

So seamless. So effortless. The Orange is heavy and, on close inspection, has pockmarks on the surface of its skin.

Moreover, those who were used to utilising flowery, melodramatic and hackneyed language, as a means of showing off literary skills, likely did so to maintain a culture of the writer as a genius, or priest. So the professor proposed a simple game to his colleagues. That they write a new piece of fiction that took the form of an interview or dialogue. That way, that simple, familiar constraint, could navigate some of the pitfalls of the 'empty page' and its temptation to over-expression. For Professor Audiard knew, pure freedom was impossible, and the notion of freedom to the human mind was sometimes painful.\n\nThree simple rules were proposed.\n1. The writer must answer the question posed in the fiction that came immediately before your own piece. Truth or lies, that didn't matter. The content was not important.\n2.

Maybe everything felt like an insurmountable problem at that point.* \n\n*During the interview after the screening, the lead actress stood on stage in a red satin suit. She seemed fantastical to me---unreal---holding every answer to every question in her mouth like, like, a smooth red berry, something pleasant. The dark haired director wore high heeled boots and spoke unapologetically about her film and the process behind it and I only sank down lower in my seat, feeling like the smallest a woman could be in that moment. Even if I had wanted to shrink, it wouldn\u2019t have been possible. No poise, no wisdom--I was fantastical to no one. I felt scrappy with my long fringe and polkadot top and my stupid screaming heart. I wanted to put up my hand and ask if they had ever felt this cracked open before and I know that the answer would have been yes. Perhaps they would have given me a gentle smile and lent me their hand to hold, just for a little while, and then they would have moved on to be strong in a way that I haven\u2019t understood yet.* \n\n---\nAt the Broken Heart Clinic they do not take the time to engage with what you have said, but they will ask you new questions---never linger, keep walking.\n\n**Let\u2019s continue with a *Sunday at 4pm without them*.

The payoff wouldn't be worth it. The point isn't to feel physically uncomfortable. It would be a distraction. \n\nI stood there carefully titrating the path of pleasure for me. It's difficult to work my way into, because there is a real risk of ruining everyone's fun, or at the very least taking something away from it. \n\nI usually begin such an evening by getting into conversation with someone. There's always someone feeling out of place, working up their courage to participate. I speak to them in reassuring tones, complimenting them and tracking their attention to get a picture of who they truly desire, then tell them flattering white lies about how I noticed the object of their desire checking them out. I tell them what I know about this object, guiding their minds to subjectify them. We're all just humans here I try to remind them, looking for a human connection. After thus doing my duty, I retreat into the corner and the orgy can begin for me.\n\nThe path for me opens right where the orgy participants start really getting carried away by their instincts. Where they are so into the people they are rubbing against that they just barely register my presence. If they were to look up, really look up and not just have some vague awareness of the white man standing in the corner, there would probably be consequences. It's a sad fact that creepers are everywhere, old dirty men who missed the bus to fulfill their own desires before it was too late and now have worked themselves into the sad space where reading Vladimir Nabokov becomes arousing rather than heartbreaking. At the same time, it's tricky as fuck because asking the whole room for consent to do what I do will call undue attention to myself, which will ruin the whole thing for me. The television helps, and I always place myself in the diagonal corner to it.\n\nI stand there feeling the rise of self-consciousness. What sort of person does that, stands in the corner while others are fulfilling their carnal desires? What sort of creeper am I to do such a thing? \n[quote=\"Geoffwithag, post:1, topic:889\"]\nWhat does \u201cme\u201d mean?\n[/quote]\n[quote=\"On another topic, post:2, topic:866\"]\n\u201cCan they see you?\u201d\n[/quote]\n[quote=\"disco4robot, post:1, topic:861\"]\nHow hard could this softness be?\n[/quote]\n[quote=\"disco4robot, post:2, topic:895\"]\nMaybe I am destined to do this?\n[/quote]\n[quote=\"SilverRose, post:5, topic:903\"]\nWhy is this young lad out?\n[/quote]\n[quote=\"EdgarSwift, post:8, topic:903\"]\nHey, what are you doing loitering around here?\n[/quote]\n[quote=\"EdgarSwift, post:8, topic:903\"]\nYou wanna hop on in?\n[/quote]\n[quote=\"Bainsdrookel, post:16, topic:891\"]\nWhat will we have to submit to in order to start meeting our basic human needs for physical connection and gathering?\n[/quote]\n\nThese are the unanswerable questions I stand there with, having a conversation with my feeling of self-consciousness. I don't stand in the corner out of any vampiric drive to gain pleasure from disrupting the pleasure of others or making them uncomfortable. Nor do I do it because I don't know what else to do... Well maybe that's not true. But it's definitely true that I do it out of choice. I do it because I've been dealt a strange particular hand to play this game of hedonistic excess that we call sexuality. \n\nThat hand may have been dealt to me by watching my 4th grade teacher, Miss Haze, standing in a tight skirt and leggings, teaching existentialist philosophy, Sartre and Kafka to boys who were much too young to handle such things, installing very adult ideas about the nature of reality into my developing brain right as the first sexual hormones began to pump through me. She was such a good teacher though. I had hung on her every word, transfixed. For a distractable boy like me, that was true love's first kiss.\n\nMy kink is self-consciousness, existentialist quandries, and alienation.

A unique voice that may tell of orchid petals dipped in red paint and the shallow delights of eating cookies in therapists waiting rooms at 8 in the morning. \n\nIf I let go now, that voice will not come to expression. My lungs will remain as empty and unexpressive as they are now, and the world will not have what I need to still speak.\n\nWhat I need to speak to my daughter. What I need to speak about filling more content into already confined spaces and the many unimportant things I have to say about this life. \n\nI must breathe. Against the resistance I must breathe, for I must express. It hurts so bad, but I must breathe.\n\nAnd I breathe in deep against the pain, and a face comes out of the blackness. It is rage and hunger. It chitters insect-like, and then it sees the inevitable, and resigns to its own undoing so that I may live.\n\nAnd I scream. Scream from the top of my breath to the bottom, and the black void releases its grip around my lungs, and the gale blows away the ancient face of the demon, crumbling away sallow cheeks and bone and tissue. The oil flows away as if beset with purpose, suddenly viscous in its escape. At the bottom of my breath the intensity rises and my throat gives it everything. The mirror cracks. The demon returns to formlessness.\n\nBack into the bog. \n\nSharpness returns to my mind. I have found myself. Dignity returns.\n\nA knock from the door.\n\n\"Amma?\"", "created_at": "2020-12-02 09:40:43.618204", "updated_at": "2020-12-02 09:40:43.618204", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 456, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [2879], "is_reply_to": [4530], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4459, "user_id": 349, "topic_id": 1194, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Our people, for their trickery and the consequent sale of their kinsmen.

We met at Granadier's, at that JP Morgan drinks night? I enjoyed chatting with you. Thought that it was a lovely evening. Really enjoyed talking about music and books with you. I don't read much. I think I'm much more of a visual person so when I'm not playing piano, I usually look at a lot of films. I like listening to the soundtracks. Anyway, I didn't want to make this letter too long. I thought that I would have seen you around sometime as K mentioned that she was going to visit you one evening. Have you seen her? Thing is, she hasn't been to uni in over a week and a half. Actually, since we all last met. Her office called Helen's phone as K had left Helen's number with the office as her emergency contact. I decided to write to you as well because I got the impression that you two were close. She's always speaking about you. She thinks you need to get out more. (Shh! That's a secret :-D)  Anyway, I thought maybe you had heard something? Or maybe she got hitched and is holed up in some guy's apartment. Knowing K she probably went off on some clandestine vacation for the week and she'll return with a suitcase of trinkets for everyone and stories. She always has these fabulous stories. I often wonder how it is that these events happen to her. Or is it because she sees the world in ways that I don't? I mean, some of these happenings, I'd probably die. But it all sounds so fantastic when she relates them to her audience. She always has an audience. She has a way about her but you know that. Even the office would be intrigued. I think they hired her because of that. She just doesn't care much about what anyone thinks. Anyway, do let me know if you hear from her. You can reach me at my email mschords@gmail.com\n \nHope that evening was fun for you. I'm looking forward to meeting you again. Let's get coffee sometime.

A weathered sign hung limply from some rusting steel cables read *Fine Marrakesh Hashish* above a dirty window with a flashing neon \"smoke room\" sign. The interior looked like someone intentionally found the grimiest and worn furnishings and carpets available. Rather than the natural wear and tear expected from new items aging in a high-traffic environment, the accouterments there looked like they has *always* been shabby. Likely, that was the case.\n\n\"Rat! Been a while since I seen you here, my friend!\" A portly, unshaven man of middle years coalesced from the shadows, smiling in a way that made most people nervous and uncomfortable.\n\n\"Hello, Hassan. Yeah, I've been living the narrow, you know, staying out of lenses.\" Jimmy leaned on the faux-wood bar top, and sucked some mid-grade from the vaporizer-hookah stem nearest him.\n\nJimmy slid his hand over the bar with a paper money note under it, as subtly as possible. Hassan nodded and took the bill. \n\n\"Not too many paying that way these days. Different clientele, you see.\" Hassan looked nervously at the front door. \n\n\"Yeah, I'm sure you are going after the Candy's uptown, right, Hassan? Trust fund kids and dilettantes, yes?\" Jimmy smiled sardonically.\n\n\"Ahem, well, things are different, is all I mean to say. You, ah, need the restroom, it's the door there on the right. Washroom code is eleven-oh-nine today.\" \n\nMost places in the city required a code for the restrooms, mostly to allow proprietors to keep junkies from overdosing in them or prostitutes from providing services there. But here it was a little different. In the restroom was a hidden panel only those who knew could locate. The panel revealed another code screen, which opened a hidden door at the back of the third stall, the access to Syn and his operation. Every one of Syn's \"friends\" had a unique access code. \n\nSyn's front office space was a flashback to an era two decades before during which everyone bizarrely agreed that carpeted walls and square, brushed-nickel furniture were high style. That was pre-Clampdown, a time when, presumably, Syn had the funds to stay fashionable. \n\n\"James! It has been too long!\" Syn, all five-feet-four-inches of him, strode toward Jimmy with his hands low and wide in greeting. Syn looked, as always, impeccable in a dated but beautifully tailored suit in bright blue, his hair flecked with gold dust and grey dye. \n\n\"Syn, you look like you haven't aged a bit. You were born looking sixty, weren't you?\" Jimmy relaxed, hearing low hum of the anti-surveillance units kick in. \n\nSyn laughed, gesturing for Jimmy to sit on a low, carpeted bench. \"Would you like some tea? I have a wonderful Darjeeling dying to steep. I saved it for a special occasion.\"\n\n\"No, I'm good, Syn.\" Jimmy knew it was probably synth garbage anyway. Syn didn't have the cash-flow for such extravagances anymore. \n\n\"What brings you here, James? You used an older channel. You may be one of perhaps three or four who still use it. That was intentional, I'd wager. Are you in some kind of trouble, friend?\" Syn sat down with a grace that was strangely out of place in the world those days.\n\n\"I don't know, Syn. I'm not sure what I have. I'm hoping you can help me figure it out. I think it is trouble but I need to know what kind.\"\n\nSyn's eyebrow rose a minute amount and his lips pursed in subtle encouragement.\n\n\"I had a woman track me down *at my place*, just showed up out of the fucking smog.\" Jimmy spat.\n\n\"A woman? What woman?\"\n\n\"Some trust-fund chick. I met her at a catering gig I did. But then she showed up at my place.\"\n\nSyn leaned in, \"Trust-fund kid? Interesting she would brave, ah, your neighborhood.\"\n\n\"I thought so, too. I mean, even the people who *live* there don't like to walk it. And she offered me...a LOT of money for a job. She didn't give specifics, just an address.\" Jimmy glanced over his shoulder, a habitual tic of one who dabbled in the illegal, \"It was eleven-eight-oh-eight, Rigon Plaza.\"\n\nSyn coughed and removed his glasses. \"Rigon. Daniel to the lions. I certainly understand your trepidation.\"\n\nSyn leaned back and spoke over his shoulder, \"Darling, give me a black line. All shadow. Onthe table, please.\" \n\nThe table between them came to life, a faint glow beneath the glass top, revealing a rotating orb the size of a fist. Characters floated up from the depth, Chinese, glowing on wither side of the orb. \n\n\"Anything else, my darling?\" The saccharine voice of Syn's VA queried.\n\n\"That is perfect, nothing else, darling.\" Syn leaned in and stroked the air over the display like a hipster playing a theremin. \"What is her name, this woman?\"\n\n\"Mallory St Vincent.\"\n\nSyn paused in his gesturing. \"St Vincent?\" There was a tinge of unease in his voice. \n\n\"Yeah, some uptown gi-\"\n\n\"Amcik, son, hat have you done to get the attention of a St Vincent?!\" Syn's face looked almost comically shocked. \"Look, you've been out of the game for a while, so I have to catch you up. About three years ago, one of my friend's sites went dark. Not like government dark, but just completely *gone*. Like it never existed. I tried a back channel and a 'board, too, just to see if he was okay. I was worried, you see. Eventually, I got up with a mutual who told me that my friend's site - his *physical* location - had been hit. Six dead, the place completely gutted by phosphorous. Shook us all up. I mean, this was a person who was an old-school, pre-war go-to, you see. A real mensch, gone, dead and burned.\" Syn's eyes went a little glassy as he reminisced, clearly moved.\n\n\"I looked into the thing. I was full of vengeance, you know, wanting to make someone *pay* for the loss. I scoured the network, all the alleyways, seeking some clue of what had happened. Not least of my worries were my own, ah, business concerns, you know. I could scarce afford attention. There was almost nothing to trace. It was as though a real professional operation, some Chinese conglomerate or another, had hit them and wiped them off the map. But not for a tiny coded flag, a dropped tag from a floater doing inquiries, I would have come up empty. I followed the thread, though, through a dozen blind ends and subtle ciphers, always on the hunt. For weeks, my friend.\" Syn looked off into the space between them, transported. \n\n\"Not much there, really. But one name kept coming up: St Vincent. A relay channel in the Philippines. A Bengali backdoor. A hub in Oslo. All used in one way or another to hide the tag. All of them owned or recently sold by Saber/Galloise, a bloody *global* security firm owned by one Alec St Vincent.\" Syn leaned in, eyes narrowing, \"So, why in the name of whatever Gods there be, are you on their radar?\"\n\nJimmy sat motionless for a few moments, not even breathing. *Fuck! A global entity?! I thought she was just an off-the-shelf trust-kid. What the hell am I going to do?!* \n\nHe sighed and put his elbows on his knees, \"I don't fucking know, man. I have no fucking clue.\"\n\n\"I think you are royally, here. Like, completely done. If you walk away, they will terminate, unquestionably. You can't hide from a global. And if you proceed...well, I suspect they will put you down when you fulfill your obligation.\"\n\nJimmy nodded. He had made the same assessment. \n\n\"I guess I will see this thing through, if just out of morbid curiosity.\" *And I like \"alive\" better than the alternative*, Jimmy mused.\n\n\"I have but to agree, my friend. Let's get you some breathing room, yes? When are you going to meet Miss St Vincent?\" Syn's raised his hands over the display, palms down, the gesture for \"ready\".\n\n\"Three tomorrow. And I have no idea how to proceed once I am there. She didn't say. I'm flying on radar.\" The speed was wearing off. He would need a bump soon. \n\n\"Yes, that makes sense. A time choice designed to make you feel a little less paranoid. Late business hour, but not too late. Wise choice on her behalf. Still light outside. It means she will probably be using the camera network to track you. I can take a couple down for 'maintenance'. Not too many, though. They will be suspicious. Let's say...sixteen-eighteen, sixteen-twenty, and, oh, seventeen-thirty-three.\" The display showed the areas that would be 'blind'. Jimmy studied them attentively. \n\n\"Can you send me an overlay? To my 'glass?\" Jimmy had recently invested in a cheap graphic interface, mounted in a contact lens-like format. It wasn't one of the high-end, Reykjavik jobs you see on the feeds, but it would do for this application.\n\n\"Sure will, James. I will also send a prox-alert for unregistered or private drones, just to be on the safe side. But listen, I can't have eyes on you the whole time. I have a business to run, as you know. But Bernice will be watching. I can intervene somewhat if she alerts me. Keep your head down, my friend. The St Vincent's are not to be trifled with. \n\nJimmy stood as Syn did, both somber and a tad jittery: Jimmy from the speed and paranoia, Syn from the unpleasantness. \n\n\"Thanks, Syn. You're the best.\" Jimmy shrugged on his jacket.\n\n\"You be safe, my friend. I will always count your help back...then, as one of the greatest favors ever done. I will continue to pay for it as long as you need help. You know the way. I have a matter to attend.\" Syn waved and turned, off into the depths of his rabbit hole. \n\n*I am a dead man. Ah, fuck it, I guess I will walk into it high and ready. Not much left in the world anyway.*\n\nThe secret door latched behind him as he entered the restroom again. *Smells like my life in here.*", "created_at": "2020-07-07 18:06:59.308939", "updated_at": "2020-07-07 18:06:59.308939", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1764, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 23.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [107], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3948, "user_id": 352, "topic_id": 1248, "post_number": 1, "raw": "[Let's do it backwards, if you please.] \n\nIn the morning I headed west via The Main Street in the center of the city.

It attracted some attention and he was invited to speak at a few conferences. Two small research grants allowed him to continue his research, and he stepped away completely from teaching. He spent all his time in his lab, in the library, or at a small bar called Strings, conferring with former colleagues.\n\nThen Blair came along. Beautiful, smart, witty Blair, of Rochester, New York, who for some bizarre reason stepped into Strings one night with two girlfriends in tow. The place was out of the way, down a small side street, and generally only attracted academics and students. It was quiet, apart from the quiz night, which were intense.\n\nJacob had never been good with women, and the ghost of a longer relationship that ended badly a few years prior still haunted him, so he did nothing. Didn't even stare that much. Her smile lit up the place, and the three women attracted a lot of attention from the patrons. Drinks were sent over, conversations were started, the mood in the whole place shifted into something else. A feeling of opportunity to explore maybe.\n\nShe came over as he sat in a booth talking to Oscar, a friend from college and a teacher of microbiology.\n\n\"Hello,\" she said. Jacob and Oscar both looked up and smiled.\n\"Hello,\" they said, simultaneously. \n\"Buy me a drink,\" she said to Jacob. He just stared. She had dark short hair and brown eyes, and was so far out of his league it wasn't even funny.\n\"Uhm, sure,\" he said, and stood up.\n\nAnd so it began. A drink and some conversation and a drink and a three hour walk and a soft kiss by her door.\n\"I will call you,\" she said, and she did. Two months later he moved into her place.\n\nBlair came from money. Old money, a lot of money. But you wouldn't know it unless you came to her apartment, which was a loft like something out of a movie.

The journal, tucked under his armpit, caused an eruption of sensations at the mere touch. J\u00f8rgen could not understand why no one was taking him seriously. They all -- all of them; curse them -- thought that the journal he'd found underneath the bench on that early June afternoon at exactly 8:34 p.m. was nothing but a piece of fiction, a written figment of someone's imagination which happened to be lost there. But J\u00f8rgen had always thought differently.\n\n\"Officer, this is serious stuff,\" J\u00f8rgen would say. The said officer would meet his eyes meekly, assuming that the person standing in front of him -- that is J\u00f8rgen -- is a lunatic. Again and again and again. In one instance, J\u00f8rgen caught an old lady by the arm and forced the journal into her hand, shouting, \"BEGONE, BEGONE!\" To his and everyone else's surprise, the old lady did not react violently; she returned the journal back to him gently, tapped him on the shoulder, and resumed her walk. In another instance, J\u00f8rgen tried to write in the journal. He opened it at random and resolved to pierce it with his pen. He failed miserably. As he positioned himself to begin writing, the pen flew out of his hand and pierced right through his bedroom wall, much like a bullet. The journal was driving J\u00f8rgen mad.\n\nYet on July 4th, a month after his find and lunacy, there was a knock on his door. Somehow, he knew who it was. He left his slumber in his bed and rushed to the door. The knock grew louder and louder as it was consistent and ceaseless. He turned the knob, prepared his smile, and --- and nothing. There was no one -- there was nothing, save for a shaft of sunlight. The odd thing was, the entrance had no windows. \n\nThat Saturday morning was, indeed, a blessing.", "created_at": "2020-07-04 06:40:03.496906", "updated_at": "2020-07-04 06:40:03.496906", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 427, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 32.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [335, 401], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2739, "user_id": 169, "topic_id": 1034, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Minerva and Lucy are left unattended.

Once he left the city and the country, he reveled in the freedom of familial distance. His parents knew, for the most part, what he was up to but that was about it. Hiding the truth was not an issue that Hermes had to face, his parents, especially his mom, wasn't very bright when it came to remembering timelines and places and people from times and places. One time Hermes took a trip to the Maldives with his then wife, Anna. His mom would later recall that Hermes \"took darling Penelope (his ex-ex-wife) to lovely Macedonia\". \n\nHis Dad was a different story. Hermes had always been closer to Dad. They shared similar hobbies, ideas and mannerisms. They enjoyed the same cuts of meat, the same vintage of wines and could had the same uncanny ability to taste exactly where in the world a certain coffee bean was from. They were similar in so many ways, and yet they differed where it mattered the most - in life's outlook. \n\nPap moved with Mam to the city to try and better they life. They had both grown up in countryside estates but had enough of cows, sheep and hills. They wanted, at least in their youth, the vibrancy and excitement of the city. That's why they chose to buy a house that was meant as a storefront. In a way, they jumped headfirst blind and naked into their new lives. \n\nOne might even say they jumped more than blind. No research on the house was done. They saw it and bought it. Why the previous owners moved out, and why there was such a turnover rate, why the house was on almost every newspaper for the past decade, they did not ask - they did not even know to ask. \n\nHermes began to question these things as he grew up. Something was odd about the house, he had always known it but since he grew up in its oddness, the oddness felt normal to him. Him and his sister would play in the attic and sometimes there would be voices coming from the cracks in the wood, b* ut as the voices were Mam and Pap's, they thought nothing of it even though what was being said was never something they would say. Hermes had, however, already forgotten what they said by the time he entered University. \n\nHe studied in a University near the city. Just far enough to be out of town, but he did not leave the country until he married his second wife, a lovely Japanese woman who took him to live with her family in Kyoto. During his first year at University, Pap gave Hermes a call asking him to go home as quickly as possible. It was near Christmas, so Hermes took an extra week off before the holidays began and rushed back to his father's side. \n\n\"You've got to keep this a secret Hermes\" his father whispered as Hermes entered the front door. \n\n\"Keep what\" he replied\n\n\"What I'm about to show you is for your eyes only, no one else can ever know about this\". His father was deadly stern. \"Promise me\". \n\n\"Yeah ok Dad, I promise\". \n\nThey entered the basement whereupon the rot burst through the air in a cloud of unimaginable stench. Hermes gagged and almost threw up but his Dad held his mouth and his stomach. \"Don't you dare, Hermes. You'll anger it\". \n\nThere was a body in the center of the room. Dried, mangled and deformed. Perhaps in a past lifetime the figure was human, but that definition had long since passed. There was nothing human about the space. The basement had transformed itself into a morgue. \n\nPap handed Hermes a book. \n\n\"Remember what you've seen. Take this book. Go back to University, graduate, leave.

Either way, I am remaining indoors more often now, no drinks at the pub, no walks during the day. I do go out at the the very small hours, to walk the alleys and wonder at the emptiness. Perhaps I am more homesick than I first would believe. \n\nI need to sleep. Good night.\n\nH", "created_at": "2020-03-20 15:42:45.800999", "updated_at": "2020-03-20 15:42:45.800999", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 305, "wiki": false, "reads": 20, "score": 29.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [320], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3294, "user_id": 414, "topic_id": 1124, "post_number": 9, "raw": "There is a real, though clich\u00e9d, story of how Satan was once the favourite of our Lord above. The most beautiful of angels and true heir to all that was holy. However, Satan grew jealous of those above him, the Son and the Holy Spirit; beauty cannot replace the shame of one's lowly birth. Satan would never fully receive the bounty of heaven, though at no fault of his own. \n\nBeauty turned to jealousy and jealousy turned to pride.\n\nA cardinal sin that sent him from the brightest of the land beyond creation to the darkest depths of the underworld. Gabriel struck Lucifer with his sword of fire and so he tumbled through the realm of the living in a ball of flame. Bursting into hell, the land lit up as his body had; where his eyes were once used to the natural light of God, Satan's eyes were now burnt by the light he created. \n\nAnd so Polly put her flare into the middle candelabra. The ground shook. The walls cracked. The altar twisted. The stone slithered. The tapestry of lights that Tyrell had but a few minutes past gazed at in wonder was now projecting a different image. \n\nThe rainbows were rivers of multicoloured blood. Animals ran into water only to stop breathing. Men with flaming sticks chased other men and upon catching, lit them up. Out of the volcano came the darkness. \n\nPolly, turning around at Tyrell and Yessa, did not step forward towards them. She placed one hand on her head and another on the melting stone altar. Silence. Silence. Silence. \n\nThen as if once again possessed, Polly slammed her head against the altar relentlessly. Tyrell dashed forward to stop her but she threw him off. Slam. Slam. Slam. Slam. Blood dripped down her forehead and onto the ground which was now covered in cracks. Slam. Slam. Slam. Slam. The cracks in the ground began to show in her skull.", "created_at": "2020-06-29 16:05:44.690646", "updated_at": "2020-06-29 16:05:44.690646", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 326, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 18.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [3256], "is_liked_by": [320], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1769, "user_id": 414, "topic_id": 871, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Is emptiness a feeling or a state?\nCan you explain that again to the ones whose faces are the definition of that which we are trying to, but cannot describe. \n\nThose which are incomprehensible.
