It is the time traveller. The softness that lies within, a shell of ones one bone. The egg is in constant flux between the before and the promise of an after. It is a meditation on the reality of uncertainty that all things in the universe hold. The universe is an unconfined egg, a becoming of ones own mother. The egg shows the potential of egg(mother)hood, beyond the capsule or container. The egg is the start of time and the ghost of the future. The classic \u201dchicken or the egg\u201d question, is the very foundation of the physics of time in a entangled word. The egg can be viewed upon as food, but not by the chickens, never by their creators, food is merely a meal, and the chickens know that their are bigger philosophies than the philosophy of the meal. \nEvery 10 year old is obliged to carry an egg with them at all times for a whole year in order to learn about care and the fragility of life.\n\n* THE HAMMER strokes your chin oh so softly. The hammer is the constructer and the destroyer. The hammers is the thing that falls on your foot, the thing that hits your thumb when your looking away. The hammer is a useful tool to build useless castles. The hammer is the giver and the taker, it is the emotions we carry, the rollercoasters we live. One could say the hammer is the ocean, but the water itself would then be the orchid. If the hammer is the wind, the orchid is the air. The hammer is the cause of a-lot of sleepless nights and mornings, its the glue and the scissor that lays between our neighbors (between relations). The hammer is double egged in that sense that, if you hit someone with the hammer in their kneecap, your kneecap will be broken too. Every mark you leave on other bodies will appear on your too. The same applies when building a house or a chair.\n\n* THE ORCHID is a mystery, a question, a guess we will never know the answer too. The orchid is the artist, portraying the worlds as a mirror image, as an afterthought, as an imperfect replica designed to expand the consciousness of the world. The orchid is the very representation of the universe (the egg) constantly expanding through its tapping into what is already there. The orchid can swallow you whole, its vulnerability is its greatest strength. The orchid is the observer that sometime shares clues about the world that we can try, but never fully decipher. The orchid has felt the dinosaurs disappear, they remember it clearly, and store the information in the water they touch through their roots.

The mechanical laws of reality do not predestine objects and beings to play out their world lines except at the cosmic scales, and even there  there is volition as the beings who consist of the interaction between cosmic filaments and galactic clusters play out their unfathomable games across fields with forces never sensed at the mesoscale. \n\nThe Universe play games of dice at the lowest scale of being. The way they fall propagate up chaotically through the many multi-branched choirs of experience associated with atoms, molecules, organelles, cells, organs, organisms, species, ecosystems, planetary biospheres. No unfoldings of these existences could be accurately predicted to any significant lengths of time, and yet Destiny is real. Because while the wheels an spokes of the mechanical universe does its chaotic turnings, existence is dominated by the prevalence of habits, not mechanics.\n\nWhen a being performs an action, any action, it plants the seed for that action to repeat, loads the dice ever so slightly in favor of it happening again.

He thinks nothing of it. Gets up and walks away. Stops, turns around. Walks back to the stone cropping where he drank. Looks again. Catches his own eye. Stares. He sits and stares. His throat constricts. A tear forms at the corner of his eye. Drops into the mirror surface, perturbing it. \n\nHe gets up. Walks away, his face distorted with anguish. Stops again, turns back, gets on all four and looks again. His mind is tormented at what he sees. It isn't what he wants to see.

The radio played low, some grunge thing, all squealing feedback, and gravelly vocals, lamenting some long-forgotten love. The sodium vapor lights washed the world's color away, though several didn't seem to be working at all, leaving pools of sick, monochromatic light along Burcam Street interspersed with blackness.

Aronsits, nor, indeed, any criminal, are not born, they are forged by a thousand choices and trials. That Rupert sat across the street from 130081 Burcam Street at two in the morning, watching for patterns, is a consequence of choices made many years ago, chief among them is the death of Pam Collieri in 1988, though it is doubtful Rupert would recognize the name or significance.\n\nPam Collieri, however, is the reason Rupert burns buildings. \n\n                           ******************************\n\nPam wondered if the acid would wear off before dawn, her fingers nervously picking at an acne scab on her chin. Bruce and David had left, gone to rage in the alleys, a pair of lunatic children run amok, leaving Pam to freak out on her own in an abandoned brownstone on Mercy Avenue. The acid was clean, equally instructive and terrifying, a chemical reset switch for her adolescent emotional health, or perhaps its undoing. \n\nThe fear came in waves, as often is the case with LSD, an intense adrenal dump, forcing Pam to imagine lurking terrors in every corner and pushing her to move, to affect escape, up the stairs and to the second story, her mind full of demons.\n\n## Prompted contribution\n\n### Prompt\n\n[quote=\"Xero, post:1, topic:333\"] <p>\u201cYes , and\u2026\u201d, the captain stared at the survivor.</p>  <p>\u201cI was lucky, that\u2019s all.

Gaul could hear only a high-pitched, constant tone like an old-time dial tone sped up. Fuzzy spots of light marred his vision as he lurched erratically in the direction of a comm-panel. His military weapons trainer had frequently admonished him to never fire a lasgun in an enclosed space, and now he understood that lesson viscerally. \n\nWith great effort, Gaul tried to orient himself. He made out what looked to be the galley hatch to his right, and a flashing red light, presumably from the comm-panel, directly in front. He reached for the comm-panel light but something wasn't right. Gaul could not feel his arm at all. Exactly at the moment he registered this, he began to taste something vaguely metallic and felt a light, warm mist settling on his cheeks. As his vision and mind cleared, he realized the mist was the remains of his arm, vaporized by a lasgun blast.\n\nGaul sat down hard on the grate of the floor, an internal scream of \"NO!\" nearly drowning out the high-pitched resonance in his ears. Shock took command of his faculties, his breath coming in a short pant, heart pumping blood to his remaining extremities. The wound had cauterized as all lasguns wounds do, saving him from bleeding out. He felt as though he would pass out.

Fate it seemed had a different idea. As I listened to the bird song I held firm the realisation that my time was up. It was impossible to see. When I look back, I think about what it felt as it happened and it is this part that puzzles me the most.  There was nothing that you would expect, no panic or fear, no life story flash backs, just clarity and an overwhelming acceptance of the truth. The truth being that here today on the 12th September 2010 at exactly 10.15pm I would die. No questions, no negotiations, no last minute prayers for absolution, nothing, an empty void as the fight vanished along with my last breath. Disappointing I know that at the crunch I rolled over and succumbed to my fate without so much as a whimper. \n\nThat was yesterday.  Today I had the chance for a do over.

Everything looked the same. \n\nI pressed my hands up against the window and remembered the vibrations of the rain last night. The black rain.

I have no idea of who any one is and at the beginning of the project, I remember thinking to myself, maybe one of them is someone I know. Maybe one of these meetings could be life changing, could germinate into a real life space, leak into my reality as fiction often tends to do. The writers seem to be from all over the world, some locations I have guessed, South Africa, Lebanon, US, England, India? I sometimes guess the gender of the author too, other tiny details. People start revealing more and more about themselves as time progresses. Does anonymity feels like an erasure or expansion of ones self?  Is these time of identity politics disabling the very idea of the invisible voice? Does the invisible voice become \u201dneutral\u201d and therefor white cis male?\n\nSometimes there are conflicts on the forum, sometimes I feel love occurs too. I wonder what would happen, if we would all meet at a party.

Its so curios to create an idea about who someone is through these words of fiction and then meet in flesh and blood and all of the things that come with it. \nThinking about my blind friend who is attracted by the sound of certain people walking. Step, step, step: Is this love? Also thinking about an art project my friend once did, where she changed life for three weeks with another artist she\u00b4d never met. Lived in her house, worked in her studio, met her friends. The moment you ACTUALLY meet is exhilarating. Its also the moment that everything falls, where nothing can be undone. Kind of like a little death. Better than a orgasm. The same reason why I was addicted to those shitty kinder-egg surprises some years ago, not the plastic toy, just the surprise- the fact of opening the egg and having no idea what so ever what is in there. \n\nAnyhow, some writing on this forum tends to be slightly biographical and even though its fiction it gives away something about the one writing it.

Get married her own mother had said, you are damaged goods from your first marriage. You are lucky any man wants you...at least he didn\u2019t hit me she thought. Her first husband had abused her from the start and that too was a marriage instigated by her mother. Twice she had married and twice because of her mothers pushing and her own lack of strength to say no. Her mother being the true villain in all of this. Raised in fear by this person who was supposed to love her, nurture her instead told her daily of her worthlessness how she had been a mistake. A cycle of abuse and domination starting with her, moving on to a rape from a man who her mother forced her to date then marry. A cycle of abuse physical and dangerous. Yet finally escape and thinking she could forget it. Yet the cycle continued with the next husband no physical abuse this time only mental and emotional. Giving birth alone, him drinking every night telling her how grateful she should be having a real washing machine, a home etc etc, she was never good enough and so she had tried to be a good mother, never laying a hand on her daughter...nurturing her the best she could all the while loving her and encouraging her to follow her dreams. But in leaving her husband despite all the group sessions with the family counselor caused a rift between her daughter and her self. And the weekends of being away from her had caused so much pain she self harmed.

The environmentalists that fought the developers had not been locals of the forest that once stood here, the majority of them had to travel no less than three hours on the train in order to arrive at the protests. Some argued that the forest was natural beauty that belonged to everyone, others said something along the lines of 'global warming will flood the dams'. For the most part, the rural woodsmen and farmers that lived off the land of the forest had already given up hope of saving the forest. Some, believe it or not, were looking forward to moving into the city. The developers had planned to build some new apartment blocks, shoddy but livable, in the suburbs, and as part of developing the forest, would have given each local family a flat of their own. However, after what was then after known as the 'sceneway compromise', the families were left to their own devices. The issue was that the architecture of the forest had still been altered. Gone were the oak trees that sheltered wild game and in its place were potted shrubbery and hedges. The soil beneath the ground had been removed and replaced with the infamous catacombs and highways that none who lived above ever entered. \n\nThe developers and politicians hailed it a victory of compromise. \n\nOffice A was an exception to this history. Designated 'A' as the first office built in the forest district after the civil war, it was built as grandly as the royal palace itself. The right wall had hand painted portraits of every royal therapist since the war; photographs of every president and official portraits of all the monarchs. The office spanned several ballrooms and had a large marble reception, a bedroom currently decorated with fine oak - oak taken from the land on which it now stands (the furnishings are rather new), and of course the office itself. Ironically, the office was the least spectacular out of the myriad of rooms. \n\n\"However\" said Marcus to the President on the grand tour which lasted no less than half an hour \"it is the original room. Everything else was an addition\"\n\n\"Even the reception room and gallery\" asked Mr. President\n\n\"Especially the gallery\" said Marcus as he made himself a martini \"You may find it funny, Mr. President, but most therapists actually don't see their portraits.

It may be a social service to bomb the station. Force those fuckers in the city offices to actually spend some money cleaning this place up. Years of practice has me looking at the stations exits and possible entryways. It would be easy, the station is the first one that is underground going south, just wait until the last train, walk in via the tracks. Even easier if it's a real bombing. No pieces to throw up at all, just fill the air with aerosol and the walls with paint. 15 minutes with a decent crew. Would be easy. \nI won't do it though. To much at stake with all the security cameras in these places. \nBut it would have been easy. \n\nThe only truly clean part of the station are the add-spaces and the wending machine glass. Clean aluminium borders and huge posters declaring some product to you. Some juice that is somehow better than the other despite it being made from the same lab produced esters mashed with as little organic content as the factories can get away with and still call it juice. \n\nThe train tracks begin to tick and a gust of warm dry air pushes into the station from the tunnel followed by a train. When I was 7 these were the new trains. They don't run during autumn though, or they try, but apparently leaves on tracks basically become motor oil when run over repeatedly with that pressure. So, yeah, trains, but erratic. The train like the station has seen it's fair share of wear over the years. The station signs catch up and displays which train it is as the door opens. Only a few get off. One in particular with a slate grey racking-hoodie and baggy cargos steps off a few doors down. Looks around, I wave and smile.\n\nLater, as we are spooning on blankets on the floor of the 3d room I've rented this year, take-out boxes smelling of spices on the covers to my bed, my mind goes over the bombing run again. But what if instead of the regular cans of paint, instead we did it with detergent? Some strong fucking Ajax shit. Guerilla cleaning.

All the scouring I had done for the sake of finding any text that might even be remotely related hadn't been any help. \n\nCrushing.

The touch had not given comfort if it had come from anyone else but him.\n\n\"If you really believe that, John, then I need to ask you to do something for me. For me and for humanity.\"\n\nJohn chuckled. \"The seriousness is present as always, I see.\" \n\n\"Stop it\", I said. \"The only thing I need from you is just that you don't contradict me, and tell anyone who asks that you believe what I say.\"\n\n\"What are planning to say?\"\n\n\"I am going to convince the people in this town and in every other town that I do understand the contents of this map. And I will tell them that it's leading us to where I want us to go.\"\n\nSo many emotions were on display before me as John processed this. The hand that wasn't on my shoulder was wrapped tightly around the beads of his necklace, which was something I didn't think I had ever seen him do before.\n\nThe emotion that won out seemed to be admiration, judging from the intense but kind look he gave me as he leaned closer. \"Maybe there is one last light left.

She did not know the end nor the beginning of them; only knew them as a pure snow-like eternity. 'How long have I been here?' was the query that came to her mind once she was conscious. She knew not of her past nor her present. She did not even know her name. But all she knew was that she was in this clean and untouched security.\n\nAll that was here in the ivory room was her and the music box she held in her hands. She looked down at the music box as if just noticing its existence now. She had not remembered it nor had even taken its existence into account when she had come into consciousness. But, looking at it now she knew. \"You are the most important thing in my life.\" She whispered, hugging the golden box close to her chest.\n\nHer body was small, only that of a child no older than 5. She stood up from her place, keeping her prized possession close to her as she watched all around her. She still did not know why she was here and what was the meaning of all this. Yet, there was a voice in the back of her head and a gut feeling telling her that-\n\n\"I am right where I am supposed to be.\"\n\nShe walked, her footsteps echoing in the achromatic plane. Her steps gave off a sound as though she was walking on glass tiles. Those glass tiles were strong though, she knew they would not waiver under her weight. As she ventured into the room, the atmosphere felt heavier and heavier by the second. Every action she took that consisted of moving forward made it seem as though everything around her disapproved.\n\nThe plane only wanted her to stay in her place.\n\n\"It's going to be alright.\" She murmured softly both to herself and to the music box she held. \"It's going to be alright.\"\n\nIn that moment, the pure walls seemed to have closed down a tad on her.

She turned her small head up, looking to where that sound originated. \n\n## Prompted contribution\n\n### Prompt\n\n[quote=\"enlohim, post:1, topic:296\"] <p>The footsteps grew closer, soft but achingly slow.

Who knows what horrors could come to them.\n\n\"Here, hold my hand,\" I said softly, extending the offer to the child. \"I'm Akil by the way, I'm on my way to Habara City. Where are you off to?\" Crouching down so it wouldn't look like I was intimidating them; I hoped we were at least close to eye level. Losing one's eyesight truly is dreadful.\n\nThe small hand that touched mine was colder than, ice and I winced at the sensation. It was almost prickling, like needles prodding against my skin. Yet, I still tried to smile- even as my gut feeling was getting worse.\n\n\"I'm lost and trying to get back home.\" The child told me whose voice I could not fathom yet if they were a boy or a girl. \"I'm scared of the monster lurking in the trees.\" Their words grew quieter as if mentioning the creature would immediately have its attention run on us.\n\nMy features scrunched up in dismay, this area was not safe and I needed to get both of us to safety. \"Don't be afraid, I'll protect you,\" I assured them as I pulled the child closer. \"Tell me your name and where you remember your house is.\"\n\nI hoped it was my imagination but, I felt as though I heard the child laugh. \"We live deep in the forest.\" They said as they started to drag me deeper into the forest. But I stood on my ground and didn't let the child runoff.\n\n\"Are you dumb?\" I scolded, annoyance obvious in my tone and I'm sure in my face as well. \"Nobody lives in the dark forest.

The air inside was cool and still, the only sound that of small hammers against silver, and the soft murmur of tourists marvelling at the skills of the smiths.</p> <p>Thaddeus had been waiting on a bench on the upper level for an hour. No tourists made their way here, kept out by a velvet rope across the staircase, and a small boy with a very serious demeanour. The letter from Solkov had allowed Thaddeus entrance.</p> <p>From inside the doorway in front of him, there was silence. The smith had stopped working. Thaddeus rose from the bench and met the woman in the doorway. The bowl she handed him was small and round, the surface smooth and soft. Old-fashioned tools had created something a factory could never reproduce. \u201cDo good to people and you\u2019ll enslave their hearts\u201d was written in Arabic around the base, in small black, precise letters.</p> <p>The bowl seemed to twist in Thaddeus\u2019 hands, and when he looked up, the wall beside him retreated in a haze of heat that wasn\u2019t there. He squeezed his eyes shut. The Modafinil was a sharp taste at the back of his throat. He took a few deep breaths. The bowl settled back into it\u2019s regular shape. \u201dIt\u2019s not what I\u2019m looking for\u201d, he said, opening his eyes. The old man seated cross-legged on the floor inside the doorway, head covered by a white keffiyeh, body wrapped in a simple white robe, smiled at him, several teeth missing, tongue darting out for a second as if to taste the air. He hadn\u2019t spoken a word since Thaddeus\u2019 arrival.</p> <p>From behind him, Thaddeus heard the woman approach.</p> <p>\u201dNot what you were looking for?\" she said.

Are you certain that bowl is not what you are looking for?\"\n\nThaddeus humored her.  He looked again at the bowl, turning it slowly within his hands.  The metal was good quality, although slightly tarnished in places, most notably the bottom where countless fingers had held it just as he was.  Still, it was not what he was looking for.  He held it out to the woman. \"I am certain.\"\n\nThe old man on the floor hide a smile as he turned away.  He said something, although Thaddeus did not understand his words; whatever language it was he spoke, it was not Arabic or English or Spanish, or any language that the professor could put a name to.  The woman laughed and took the bowl.  But when Thaddeus turned to leave she bid him wait.  \n\nShe filled the bowl with water and brought it back to him, handing it to him once more.  \"Look again, my friend.  Are you certain you have found no dreams?\"\n\nThaddeus had no patience for this, but as he took the bowl something in it caught his eye.  A haze of heat over the water, a shimmering of the air.  He paused and looked again more closely.  The bowl spun in his sight and the water pulled away, a white mist taking its place.  He squeezed his eyes shut again and took a few breaths, but when he opened his eyes once more the mist was still there.  Curious, Thaddeus leaned in.  He could almost see something through the white and he leaned closer.\n\nBy the time Thaddeus realized he had fallen into the mist, it was too late and there was no stopping it.  The clanged as it hit the floor, spilling water and rocking back and forth as it settled, ringing.

This time, it\u2019s through a project we call the Science Fiction Economics Lab. This project is very different from Babel, but I figured some of the same people might be interested.\n\nThere is a webinar on December 7th, 17.00 CET. [Register here!](https://tell.edgeryders.eu/14783)\n\n[quote=\"alberto\"]\nA while back, we at the Sci-Fi Economics Lab had a new idea: instead of writing academic papers, we could channel out-of-the box economic thinking around building a fictional world, to serve as the backdrop for works of science fiction or fantasy. In retrospect, it seems obvious: after all, this space exists because a small patrol of economically inclined sci-fi authors invested a lot of time and brainpower into dreaming up [exotic economic systems](/t/econ-sf-a-selection-of-works-and-authors/8582). But we added a couple of extra ideas to that original insight.\n\nFirst, **we decided to build the world in a participatory way.** We want anyone to be free to contribute ideas, analysis, references, visuals, and so on. Would technologies of great power (like *Star Trek* \u2019s replicators) be compatible with a market economy as we know, based on scarcity? How would slower-than-light interstellar trade work? (Nobel laureate Paul Krugman actually [worked that one out ](https://www.princeton.edu/~pkrugman/interstellar.pdf)) How can *Harry Potter* \u2019s Wizarding world use precious metal as a currency, given that wizards can simply magick out more of it and cause hyperinflation? No matter how smart, an individual author can not keep track of all the possible variables and their permutations. So, we are going to do that as a community. It just makes sense. There are already over 150 people posting on this forum, many of us professional economists. **We are licensing the world with an open source license** : you can use it for your novel, film or game, and no lawyer will ever come calling if you make it big.\n\n**Second, we decided we want a world that contains several economic systems, not just one** . Again, this is an old trick in sci-fi: Anarres and Urras in Ursula K. Le Guin *The Dispossessed* , the Hives in Ada Palmer\u2019s *Terra Ignota* , the Acquis and the Dispensation in Bruce Sterling\u2019s *The Caryatids* , and so on. This plurality creates a nice narrative tension, as characters can move across places and experience different economies. Also, readers tend to start thinking which economic system they would choose, if they were free to do so. For example, [this poll ](https://www.poll-maker.com/poll1009893xa10948B5-42) about \u201cwhich Terra Ignota Hive would you choose\u201d is popular on the Internet ([explanation of the Hives ](https://www.tor.com/2017/03/13/writing-a-future-in-which-you-choose-your-own-nation/)).\n\nBut participatory projects work best if someone makes an initial investment in them. Participating in filling an empty space can be intimidating, or simply not that much fun. So, **third, we decided to [offer a writers\u2019 residency](https://edgeryders.eu/t/writers-residency-come-lead-the-worldbuilding-academy/14502) to someone to lead the charge** . The residency is generously funded by Fondazione di Comunit\u00e0 Messina, the people with [one of the weirdest, most fascinating real-life economic models ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/8-9-scifi-economics-lab-2-the-strange-economy-of-messina/13966) we have found so far. Among the applications who flowed in, many stood out; but in the end, the strongest one came from [Yudhanjaya Wijeratne ](https://yudhanjaya.com/), a Nebula-nominated author from Sri Lanka and a member of our community (as @yudhanjaya). His novel *Numbercaste* has been on our [wiki of economic sci-fi ](/t/8582) since the beginning.\n\nYudhanjaya pointed out that, in order to bring the world to a level of maturity where contributing to it is fun and interesting, **a small team is better than one person. So, fourth, we decided to create one** . The other team members are [Joriam Ramos ](https://joriamramoscv.webflow.io/) (here as @Joriam), a Brazilian author and designer affiliated to [Enspiral ](https://enspiral.com/); [Michela De Domenico ](https://unime.academia.edu/MichelaDomenico) and [Marco Lo Curzio ](http://www.accademiadicatania.com/docenti/MarcoLoCurzio), Italian architects and illustrators; and [yours truly ](https://www.cottica.net), as the resident economist. If you want to volunteer for the core group, just let me know with a comment or a DM.\n\nThis group has the task to prepare, and pre-populate an online space where we all can contribute to build an open source. We are preparing a webinar which will be held Monday, 7 December at 17.00 CET, to present our concept and initial thoughts, and seek feedback from the community.

Survival of the fittest. But nobody wanted to know.\n\nThe Spiritually-Sick were the worst of them, Instagram models looking to find themself in something other than a mirror. One would tell me the best place to whiten my teeth as I found my gaze wandering to a missed patch in her spray tan. This same girl was the kind who'd suck up to a shaman at the cafe but blow right past a child asking for some rice. \n\nAs she delicately applied a silvery stick-on tattoo on her wrist, she told me she loved that I could tan naturally with my skin.

At Shetfield we can expect to euthanize 5 to 15 creatures a day, frequently vicious and rabid ones.

I am on holiday, currently sat on a beach. Warm sun caresses my face. The steady wash of the waves hypnotises me and I have sand between my toes.\n\nOf course, I can\u2019t really feel the lazy heat of the sun. I care little for the monotony of the tides and there are not enough grains of sand on this beach to match the number of souls I have collected over the years. But, as you say, we all need a holiday!\n\nNow. Turning to your predicament. I would advise caution for a start and overall, a change of tack.\n\nFor it may well be that it is not the whimper of a discarded and condemned animal which calls me from my slumber. It may well be that your rabid rottweiler has escaped its tether and has launched at you, sinking its foamy teeth deep into your throat. It may well be that your puppy wheezes its rare and deadly bronchial malaise deep into YOUR lungs. Or, and I stifle a laugh here, it may well be that you trip over the Poodle which gnaws at your leg. You fall. Awkwardly. Ooh! There\u2019s a crack and something is suddenly not well with you.\n\nYou see then it will be YOUR cry which drags me reluctantly from my lounger. The sand may be still falling from my feet as I rush to your side. \n\nIf this is why I am called to be there, the fate of your animals will thereafter be of no consequence.\n\nSo, as for my proposed change of tack. Please consider sympathising with your animals. Groom them and love them so that a young child may drag their parents into your showroom and beg that they be able to leave with a harmonised hamster, a pampered poodle or even a rambunctious rottweiler.\n\nFinally, neither yourself nor your niece should attempt to play with the big boys.\n\nI\u2019ll leave that with you.

Rejuvenating even. At times. \n\nHad there been nothing beneath his feet in Santa Clara, the drops may have felt similar. The ground beneath his feet however presented a conundrum. The gift of water, raised the heat from concrete and asphalt. It was suffocating unless there were several days of heavy showers. But then, this would brings days of flooding on account of engineers who evidently had purchased their qualifications at an outlet mall and had found suitable employment in the civil service. \nHere, far away from Santa Clara, the rains were different. \nToday, even more so. \nThere would be people in yellow and black raincoats perhaps.

He didn't think he could give a proper statement. \n\nHis cellphone rang. The vibration in his pocket jolted him. \n\nHe stood up and immediately felt dizzy.

The cold, with its nocturnal rapacity, coiled itself around the looming silhouettes of the city -- a landscape so distant yet familiar transfused itself into her sharp vision. Had she been thrown into this moment, Anahid would not have known that it was September 3rd, 2050. Some things do remain intact, after all, albeit time still hadn't learned to hit the breaks when needed; it only knows one direction: forward. She turned and stared into the opposite side of the world. Water, wind, waste. The three W's that defined the first half of the twenty-first century. \n\nThey called it The Second Year of the Flood, which was later replaced with The Change. There was a time, Anahid recalled, when The Change was a reference to something that had to do with females. Anahid chuckled softly at the notion. Females, Males... One, two... Intersex, three... Post-sex: four? Little did they know -- them, humans and magicals alike -- that nature gave oh-so-little fucks about their perceived dichotomies. When coastal cities resigned themselves to the rising rage of the seas, no one, Anahid noticed, put up a banner to defend their ideology. Scared little shitshows huddled together and comforted each other and preached, what, the new understanding of hegemony? Fuck them, Anahid whispered to the flirting wind. Fuck them; they should have listened. Her elbows were resting on the metallic end of the boat; she looked behind her, down at the rippling sea, and even in that darkness, she could make out sharp ends of what used to be a historical city.\n\nThat morning, she felt something stir in her chest. No, it was not the scar left by her last fight. She'd stopped fighting for almost thirty years. Having been brought from the dead, she was the Jesus of her community, except with more grit in her punches. What do they know, she wondered and sighed. There was always room for a miracle, even in this cowardly new world. \n\n\"Hey,\" someone whispered to her left. \n\nLost as she was in her thoughts and observations, she failed to notice the steps of her interlocutor. Anahid grinned, and though it was dark and barely visible, the curling of her lips was well registered by the intruder.\n\n\"Hey,\" she returned and removed herself from her post. \"Come here, Rickie.\"\n\nRick moved himself awkwardly. He had always been sea-sick, hating the instability, fearing an eventual capsize. He wriggled himself into her embrace. \n\n\"Are you okay?\" Anahid asked -- an otherwise normal question. But when Rick did not answer immediately, or at least, mechanically, Anahid grew worried. She placed a finger under his chin and lifted it from her chest. \"Hmm?\" she wondered.\n\nRick removed himself from her grip and stood next to her, imitating her posture. He heaved a sigh.\n\n\"She's here,\" he said finally.\n\n\"She?\"\n\n\"Her, the woman.\"\n\n\"The woman? Wha---\"\n\n\"The witch, the cause of it all, the bane of my existence -- how else should I describe her?\"\n\n----\n\n\"If I'm about to have an everlasting life, I'll need more than a hundred euros to survive. You know how irrelevant money has become nowadays.\"\n\nThis smeared the old woman's face with a wry smile. \"Smart,\" she said. \"I like that. Baby steps, my dear.

There was no driveway nor garage nor any entry point for a vehicle at all. Those were features that Mammy considered unnecessary as she never learned to drive.\nThe house was painted grey, like the color of the sky on a rainy day, but strong white pillars framed the open porch. On either side of the porch, the house was perfectly symmetrical with peaked roofs and dormer windows.\nIt was truly magnificent.\nIt wasn\u2019t always the envy of the neighborhood, though. It had started out as a wooden shack with a haphazard galvanize roof, where Mammy had spent her childhood, decades before I was born. She often told us stories of that time. Happy stories of climbing mango trees, frolicking in the yard and splashing about in water puddles left behind by the rain. When she spoke about it, it was almost always with a smile. But the shack held painful memories for her too. She had returned to it at age 30, with two children in tow, after one beating too many from the man she had married. Not a month later, the shack had burned to the ground with the children inside. Mammy had barely escaped herself. She bore the white, ugly scars all over her body as a gruesome reminder of the fire that took her boys. Nobody knew what had started the fire. Mammy believed the boys were playing with matches. There was some talk about her husband setting fire to the shack in the dead of night as revenge for her leaving.

I wasn\u2019t expecting this. It\u2019s Sunday night, it\u2019s right before Christmas, I saw this call on Twitter and clicked on the link and was not at all ready to write something from scratch. So if you\u2019ll forgive me I\u2019ll share some end-of-year thoughts from the trenches of the latest social movement in France. So here I am sitting in Paris, and we\u2019ve had these public transport strikes for the past few weeks. A year ago it was the yellow vests. It\u2019s too early to say the strikes have brought the city to its knees. Three weeks ago I kind of anticipated that I\u2019d have something wise and macro to say about the movement by now, on the eve of Christmas, and that confidence came from my memory of the last month-long strike over pension reform in Paris, back in 1995.</p> <p>Well, 1995 was another era and things feel very different this time round. Back then we didn\u2019t have phones & 10 different types of micro-mobility. 1995 was a cold winter, and a very long strike, about 6 weeks. But it felt more orderly. This time there is a kind of gritty chaos that has made the long cross-town walks feel a bit more\u2026 well, gruelling? Or never-ending? You might say, why can\u2019t everyone cycle? Well, it\u2019s chaos, bike accidents are up 40%. Velib bicycles are in short supply. The walking is odd. People get into a trance-like stride. After an hour or more of walking you\u2019re just focused on getting to the end. Nobody has the patience to adapt to anyone else, so people crash into eachother, or almost, constantly. In 1995 the mood felt lighter. People commented on getting fitter. On feeling more connected with their community.</p> <p>I actually really wish I could say what\u2019s happened is \u201cWe Make the Road By Walking\u201d, the title of a book by Paolo Freire and Myles Horton. That it\u2019s a pleasure when you focus less on the destination. But the honest, banal truth is this. My feet hurt, my legs ache, my will to spot a light somewhere is fading and I just want it to end.</p> [/quote]\n\n  \n\n### Response", "created_at": "2020-01-01 18:36:28.821129", "updated_at": "2020-02-03 15:35:42.142476", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 396, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 1.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [526], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 504, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 22, "post_number": 3, "raw": "", "created_at": "2019-12-20 02:08:09.691581", "updated_at": "2019-12-20 02:08:09.691581", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 42, "score": 8.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1978, "user_id": 354, "topic_id": 893, "post_number": 6, "raw": "I listen to the cry of a side plate colliding with the kitchen tiles. \nI am on my lounge carpet, it scratches my bare back and irritates the skin. \nI concentrate on prolonging the ringing sound.  \nand wish to be the new person. \n\nThere are five cookies left and no sugar or chocolate. \nI have eaten the other forty myself. \nNo absent minded voice to accept my offering. \n\nThe berries must be plump right now - i think \nas i rise. \nTheir juices must be sweet - I imagine\nas I enter the kitchen. \nThe taste must linger - i hope\nas i stretch my fingertips into the ceramic crash site. \nAnd their skins peel easily  \nas my wall papered life bleeds red.", "created_at": "2020-03-29 17:29:32.971576", "updated_at": "2020-03-29 17:29:32.971576", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 120, "wiki": false, "reads": 25, "score": 20.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [1956], "is_liked_by": [403], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3891, "user_id": 401, "topic_id": 1238, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\nJust after breakfast, she went out for a walk to clear her thoughts before work.

I wasn't expecting this. It's Sunday night, it's right before Christmas, I saw this call on Twitter and clicked on the link and was not at all ready to write something from scratch. So if you'll forgive me I'll share some end-of-year thoughts from the trenches of the latest social movement in France.\nSo here I am sitting in Paris, and we've had these public transport strikes for the past few weeks. A year ago it was the yellow vests. It's too early to say the strikes have brought the city to its knees. Three weeks ago I kind of anticipated that I'd have something wise and macro to say about the movement by now, on the eve of Christmas, and that confidence came from my memory of the last month-long strike over pension reform in Paris, back in 1995.\nWell, 1995 was another era and things feel very different this time round. Back then we didn't have phones & 10 different types of micro-mobility. 1995 was a cold winter, and a very long strike, about 6 weeks. But it felt more orderly. This time there is a kind of gritty chaos that has made the long cross-town walks feel a bit more... well, gruelling? Or never-ending? You might say, why can't everyone cycle? Well, it's chaos, bike accidents are up 40%. Velib bicycles are in short supply. The walking is odd. People get into a trance-like stride. After an hour or more of walking you're just focused on getting to the end. Nobody has the patience to adapt to anyone else, so people crash into eachother, or almost, constantly. In 1995 the mood felt lighter. People commented on getting fitter. On feeling more connected with their community. \nI actually really wish I could say what's happened is \"We Make the Road By Walking\", the title of a book by Paolo Freire and Myles Horton. That it's a pleasure when you focus less on the destination. But the honest, banal truth is this. My feet hurt, my legs ache, my will to spot a light somewhere is fading and I just want it to end.\n\n## Prompted contribution\n\n### Prompt\n\n[quote=\"fadaso, post:6, topic:57, full:true\"] <p>Lately, my t-shirts have become too small.

He thought it was running cold. Now it shrinks my t-shirts.

It was our usual kinda luck that brought us both there over the same time. Eve got her first role as the love interest in a feature film. I was on a program to give young filmmakers their first opportunity at making a short with a full crew and relatively decent budget. \n\nI will never show the film to a soul. It sucked. I blame the producers. They obviously blame me. But I actually rocked under the circumstances - another story. Eve also decides after seeing herself on screen that she will never act again. She now writes for TV. Also she has published two books. She ends up taking her rightful place at the head of our household. \n\nAnyways, it is our first night out in the city and we head to a hipsterish cool kid bar that we have heard a lot about. We enjoy each other and for additional spectacle we entertain the affections of those around us. A dude from the US who we met a couple of days earlier ends up in the same bar. He had interviewed us for his PHD because we made some content that was viral and the social commentary moved the general zeitgeist. He is with his partner, who is really smart and beautiful and we can tell they are the type to swing. But we don't really want to, it feels too simple. \n\nThere is a young money kinda guy at the bar. He offers us drinks, we choose what we like - not what's cheap. He doesn't flinch. We know about Joburg's blesser culture and we wanna explore. To be honest, blesser culture can get very dangerous and it is not all glam. But tonight it is. \n\nWe leave with him. His car is fancy but it's been a while and I don't know cars well enough to care to recall it. We are going to his friend's hotel. Literally, his friend owns the hotel. His 'friend' is probably more like a business mentor and the dude we arrive with becomes nothing more than the driver. \n\nWe sit at the bar and we drink Hennesy and they decide to take us to a club. This hotel dude drives to the club. Literally, I shit you not, we step out of the car where the red carpet begins. He throws his keys to a valet and we walk into VIP. Eve and I are living our best *Hustlers* life. \n\nIn VIP, only expensive bottles of alcohol is on the table. Hotel Dude and Young Money don't bother us. We talk with everyone and occasionally make out with each other  in a lesbian way, not a we want you to think this is hot way.  We don't feel controlled, only indulged. \n\nAmong the men in VIP is a Nigerian Media Mogul. He is beautiful and young but he is also homophobic. I ask if he knows an old fling of mine from university. She is a popular talk show host in his country now. He tells me that she is his sister and I look at him long enough to see him wonder how I know her. \n\nEventually we leave and go home with the hotel man. He lives in a mansion (obviously) and while he goes to the toilet or something we discuss if we want to sleep with him. Because we are wild and  the memory requires it, we sleep with him.  We speculate that he must have a wife and child, but also that she probably knows what he is up to and we decide not to feel guilty. \n\nHe is another sweetie. He tells us that he doesn't feel comfortable licking the bean. Our hearts melt a little. He practices on Eve, I give direction. Eventually I ride him, moan when he wants to hear it and he cums easily. Eve, who has only ever had sex with men with me, watches and I can tell that she wants to be more confident during penetration. Also, she would like to enjoy sex with a man, but our drunken encounters are not offering this. She might need to find her perfect man lay herself. \n\nThe next morning, he gives us R4000 for the uber home. I am stunned. We never expected.. but then it would come in handy...we are still young artists...and I take it and said thank you.

In the liberal utopia, we\u2019ll all just get out of our cars one day and greet each other walking. Behind us, vines will engulf the old engines and start taking them apart. My iPhone, still plugged into the in-car charger, will never serve a purpose again. The evening campfires won\u2019t have any drunks or <insertdrugofchoice>heads and no one will be talking out of their arse about their limited view of socioeconomics. \n\nThe first evening will be bliss. No one has a device to look at and you can see the stars. The brave among the unified will choose new names and wax lyrical about self-organising systems and non-violent communication. Many more will begin to wonder how to make wine and send emails.\n\nA sharp crack shatters the quiet of my musings and I\u2019m running. In this city, in these days, you flee first and then stop to wonder what you are leaving behind later. \n\nAnother crack and I\u2019m on the pavement.

The gauze seemed flimsy but she had seen it deflect bullets and blades. It wasn't impenetrable, but lighter than any armor she had ever seen before. There were no visible buckles or anything that could be used to open it, and initial attempts to yank it off had only resulted in curses and bruises.\n\nThe chamber they stood in was underneath the main bastion of the Protector General, part of the hidden complex carved into the rock beneath the city.

It was as if her own weight had been lifted, and she was merely a wind moving through a bright vastness free of resistance. Just as she was beginning to get accustomed to her new, carefree existence, something in the back of her mind, or somewhere in the cloudy distance, opened up. A hole of sorts.

I reached for his hand and with a handshake he had gotten what he wanted. Without hesitation he gave me what I was here for. A map leading to a hidden power source from before the war. I could not believe I was holding this map in my hands. If the stories was true, this power source could save the entire world. I politely said goodbye to the hat guy. \"Be careful. if that map ends up in the wrong hands it could lead to horrible destruction.\" He said. \"Don\u00b4t worry, our only option is to restore the balance that was lost in the war, and I will make sure this happens now when I possess the map.\" I replied. \nI walked out and started to contemplate what I just said. Did we really lose the balance, or was it the comfort of having unlimited power and food that created an illusion of balance? Since the rebels took down all the world governments there has been alot of misery but I belive this map is the beginning of a future filled with love and light. \n\n## Prompted contribution\n\n### Prompt\n\n[quote=\"fadaso, post:6, topic:57, full:true\"] <p>Lately, my t-shirts have become too small.

Underneath the yellow-ish paper she could see some pink paper. The yellowish she recognised as the usual consent forms with all the boxes for personal details and contact numbers and stuff. So boring that they couldn\u2019t be coordinated enough, in this day and age, to have all her deets electronically and for her to just do an amazon delivery style scribble to say she approved.

This girl seemed both keen, he\u2019d seen her working with his colleagues often enough to know she would be interested in a Saturday test.\n\n\u2018Colleagues\u2019 perhaps that was a little misleading, their relationship wasn\u2019t exactly that of peers. But Kim did not need to know that. He had watched his *co-workers* often enough to know how to behave. How to act with authority. He knew how to command respect for a position he did not have. He had concluded, after eleven months of mopping the hallways, emptying bins and cleaning down the rooms that it boiled down to a simple collection of key points.\n\nStance. The way he presented his physical being. He had had to focus quite hard on pulling himself into a better posture and assuming a stronger position. The fifty press-ups a day for the last four months had helped immeasurably and he was even starting to quite look forward to them in the mornings.\n\nTiming. Pauses were everything. People always liked to make assumptions and were, bizarrely to him, deferential to doctors. He had spent much time in front of his bathroom mirror. He rented a tiny shoebox from a guy who he was fairly sure was dealing to most of the frat boys on campus. But it suited him to be living in a dead end corner of town. Anonymous. Although the 3inch circumference of the filthy little silver mirror did make it quite tricky to practise his poise and hold conversations with imaginary patients. But pauses were everything. Leave people gaps to launch themselves into. They just cannot help it. They will reveal themselves to you.\n\nClothing. It hadn\u2019t taken long to find the white overcoat in the changing rooms that fitted him well. It had taken longer to save up for the smarter shirt and pants. Worthwhile investments if it all went to plan.\n\nSelf-grooming. Doctors were well presented. Face and hands were of particular importance. Moisturising his hands had made him feel like a bit of a dick. He wasn\u2019t really \u2018like that\u2019. But he enjoyed the ritual and it made him feel important. Preparation, he had decided, definitely gave him a pleasing sense of self-importance (and often led to self-love) (other things were also now well moisturised).\n\nAnd now here he was.

Just...tired. The days had been extra long  recently and the prophet only knew how he made it through them in his age. An endless line of customers during the day, all of them wanting to go somewhere else but time or hunger or money drove them to his door. Now he has cleaning the kitchen seeing as he had no customers. Although his shop had seen far better days and that it was far from the best falafel even in the neighbourhood, he still took an odd pride in that the kitchen and the food was clean.\n\nA long day making falafel and fries had taken its toll though. Especially now that his son Omar had a newborn daughter to take care of and that meant more work for Faraj in the shop.

Faraj felt to old to really understand the fashions of the teens in this country but he figured that would be true about teens basically anywhere. \n\"Welcome miss, how can I help you tonight?\"\n\"Ehm... I'd like a take away falafel and a coke\" She said and Faraj noticed she kept tugging on the bottom of the shirt in what seemed a nervous tick while she looked out of the shop window. Well, he could make her the last customer of day.\nHe asked the usual about the sauces and prepped it as she wanted, non to spicy but extra hummus. \n\"Do you want some fries to go with that? I'm closing for the night so they are for free.\" He asked her, she nodded absently and continued to tugg on the shirt. \nHe handed her the food and the drink and thanked her for her custom as his father had taught him long ago. Through the glass he saw how she met up with a teenage boy and he smiled. \n\nAh, to be young and nervously in love.", "created_at": "2019-12-22 23:27:01.004389", "updated_at": "2020-03-03 17:06:31.575506", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 636, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 28.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [196], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 404, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 147, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2019-12-17 23:25:11.388833", "updated_at": "2019-12-17 23:25:11.388833", "deleted_at": "2019-12-18 00:03:29.630285", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 398, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 141, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2019-12-17 23:19:45.477870", "updated_at": "2019-12-17 23:19:45.477870", "deleted_at": "2019-12-18 00:03:45.344930", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1431, "user_id": 442, "topic_id": 792, "post_number": 1, "raw": "## Unpromted contribution\n\nWho are you?\u201d The grey man ashed his cigarette as a light gust of wind carried it away to who knows where.

As the world around them danced violently and threw their most precious belongings at their bodies, Sabrina could only help but to whisper, almost sing, into her baby's ear the words \"Everythings fine, we're going to be okay. Mommy loves you. Mommy Loves you, okay? Mommy loves you\". The words uttered was mostly for her own sake, the noise of the world crashing, and falling probably killed any other noise trying to reach little Adam's ears. \nBut then it all stopped. \nNothing.\nSabrina didn't dare to move. What if it was all just a trick? What if this was all just the wrath of some ancient god having had enough of selfish humans? What if this was because of her crumbling marriage and how she did not do enough? or how she chose someone who didn't make her happy when she had the choice of so many others? \nHer thoughts raced around and around trying to make sense of something she couldn't, so for the first five seconds(or the eternity of mankind, she was still uncertain about the time frame)everything and nothing, facts and fiction dictated her mind.\nThe crackling of bits and pieces rubbing against each other was present as Sabrina tried to lift herself off the ground. Like heavy snowfall, rubble and dust fell to the ground off of her body, laying itself beside her, still terrified child.\nA dull pain spread across the back of her head as she bumped into what might've saved her very life. A dark wooden beam had fallen and laid itself across the room with the very top of it resting neatly on the half-fallen over wardrobe, that had been screwed into the wall with great hassle just a few years prior, holding each other up, keeping each item from falling further.

She sat down on her couch, strong black coffee in hand and a cigarette dangling from her lips. She had worked really hard on finishing her book and was just one poem away from completion. The dark black bags under her eyes the only indicator that she hadn't slept for days. She was exhausted, spiritually and emotionally, let alone physically. This book was going to be her break and she was nearly there. She started typing, the feel of the cold keyboard a welcoming contrast to the humid Durban evening, sticky and thick as it always was during the Summer. As she typed a calm descended on her, it was as if she had been in labour. The pressure of birthing this project weighed heavy on her, and as she pushed herself to finish the final poem she felt the release that came during the transition phase, just as the head was about to crown...\n\n\n\n\"Dear mother,\nI see you\nHiding behind the smile you wear while wiping the tears from the face of your child\nI see that look in your eyes, the last remnants of the wild woman,\nPruned and proper, by the brush of patriarchy\nI see you\nTrying your best to wake up every morning while your soul is still half asleep\nOh woman, even If they never see your fingers bleeding, your hair in a mess, \nnone of it really matters i guess, because your heart was in it\nEven if they dont see you trying to feed your babies, trying to keep them clean in a filthy world\nEven if they dont see the tears you cry,your lips trembling with each word\nEven if they dont know the pain you endure to stay sane\nEven if they never see your hunger and your struggle\nI see you my sister\nI am you my sister\nI see you holding the future in your capable arms, protecting them from untold harm\nNursing and nurturing the next generation,the most important instruction, so calmly\nI see you.

While she lay next to her four month old daughter, nursing, her mind drifted back to the events of the previous night. They were about to move. It was nerve wracking. Adam was all nerves and no help. Her life was chaos. But she knew it wouldn't last forever.\nSomething amazing had happened. She wasn't sure if it were due to  lack of sleep or if she had been dreaming but she remembered it so clearly that it had to have been real. She let her mind recall the encounter, not sure what to make of it all. \n\n\nAs Kayleigh sat on her couch, the same threadbare couch she always sat down to work at. She was  just about to start working when she saw something out of the corner of her eye and looked up to see the room suddenly flooded with a warm orange glow as if someone had bathed it in sunlight.  It was 11:00pm at night. She was stunned. Unable to move she just stared silently. The light took on the distinctive shape of a woman.\n\"Kayleigh, don't be afraid\" the woman had said.\n\nKayleigh was unable to speak. Her eyes were glued to the magnificent radiance that emitted from this person before her. Was she a person? Her body was shaking. The woman spoke again.\n\n\" I have come to bring you a message, I am sent by the council...\"  \n\nKayleigh opened her mouth to speak but thought it best to listen. \n\n\" Don't be afraid dear one, we are so proud of you. You are doing a great job. When you were sent here we were worried that you might not make it, there were times when we felt your pain, but it was not in vain....we know how difficult this planet might seem. \"\nKayleigh finally managed to find her voice\n\" Am I dreaming? \" she asked. Her voice was quivering.\nThe woman smiled.\n\" Do you remember me Kayleigh?... \nI was your grandmother, they sent me to you to remind you to not give up. You are fulfilling your mission, you are so close...\"  Kayleigh looked down at the ground tracing a circle with her toe on the wooden floor. Her heart was pumping, she could barely breathe. \nFor a second she doubted herself, I must be dreaming, she thought. Her grandmother was long dead. But she listened respectfully.\n\n\" your story Kayleigh. It must be completed. It is the final step towards realizing yourself. You have come here to shine a light in the darkness. You have come to heal. You are the personification of love itself and the world needs your love\"\n\nAs she said this, Kayleigh heard Adams voice in the next room asking her who she was talking to,  that same instant the light started to fade and the woman was gone.\n\nHer whole body was covered in sweat. It was three days till they moved and she knew she had to finish before they got on the train. \n\nAs Kayleigh put the baby down, who was fast asleep, she couldn't shake the feeling of knowing that pulsed through her body. It was exhilarating and her sleepiness had diminished. She went back to her office and sat back down at the laptop. Lighting another cigarette, she inhaled deeply, the ash dropping to the floor. Il get that later she thought and started to type again. \n\n\"We are all born innocent and unconscious of the reality we are presented with . And then we grow up being imprinted by our mothers and fathers, uncles and aunts, grandparents, teachers. They teach us how to be human. No one escapes the conditioning thanks to mirror neurons in the brain. It is essential to our survival. However depending on where we end up growing up and the families we have, our perspectives change. And not always for our immediate benefit. During Apartheid, South Africa those circumstances dictated the course of your life. As with many oppressive movements, the war is most often a mental one. If we are imprinted with a programming of lack, oppression and destitution then what are the odds we will encounter anything other that would impact our lives enough to change those circuits. And if you are born into a life of wealth, prosperity and opulence, would you consider the other side? And ultimately how do we transcend the mundane and change our realities enough to impact the greater picture and create real lasting change.... \"\n\nThese questions circulated in her mind. She was  experiencing an intense spiritual awakening and   healing simultaneously. She managed to stay awake long enough to finish the task at hand before sinking deeper into the couch. That was enough for tonight she thought. The kids had been challenging that day.  While she sat there Kayleigh allowed herself to pause as she experienced a separation of sorts. The self that she had had become, the woman she was meant to be and the child that grew up. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Prompted contribution\n\n### Prompt\n\n[quote=\"onyxnobis, post:1, topic:264\"] <p>She shook her head to clear her mind of the haunting memories that never truly left her alone.

The pink flesh much like her heart had never healed. All those years, she had suffered silently. All those years she had swallowed the abuse, for the sake of her children. She looked at her daughters face. The face she'd caressed so many times, now twisted in pain, she was the splitting image of her father.\n\n\"I never knew...\" she finished. \n\n\"I know, I made sure of it.\" All those years she'd hidden it well.

But I was just so tired of hiding myself from you, and of merely whispering and moving things around. I wanted to show myself, so we could really start our friendship.

Those are slippery things, my friend. They are not always easy to find. Are you certain that bowl is not what you are looking for?\u201d</p>  <p>Thaddeus humored her. He looked again at the bowl, turning it slowly within his hands. The metal was good quality, although slightly tarnished in places, most notably the bottom where countless fingers had held it just as he was. Still, it was not what he was looking for. He held it out to the woman. \u201cI am certain.\u201d</p>  <p>The old man on the floor hide a smile as he turned away. He said something, although Thaddeus did not understand his words; whatever language it was he spoke, it was not Arabic or English or Spanish, or any language that the professor could put a name to. The woman laughed and took the bowl. But when Thaddeus turned to leave she bid him wait.</p>  <p>She filled the bowl with water and brought it back to him, handing it to him once more. \u201cLook again, my friend. Are you certain you have found no dreams?\u201d</p>  <p>Thaddeus had no patience for this, but as he took the bowl something in it caught his eye. A haze of heat over the water, a shimmering of the air. He paused and looked again more closely. The bowl spun in his sight and the water pulled away, a white mist taking its place. He squeezed his eyes shut again and took a few breaths, but when he opened his eyes once more the mist was still there. Curious, Thaddeus leaned in. He could almost see something through the white and he leaned closer.</p>  <p>By the time Thaddeus realized he had fallen into the mist, it was too late and there was no stopping it. The clanged as it hit the floor, spilling water and rocking back and forth as it settled, ringing. The old man laughed as the woman bent to retrieve her bowl. \u201cMay you find dreams and not nightmares, my friend.\u201d</p> [/quote]\n\n  \n\n### Response\n\nThaddeus opened his eyes. The mist was still surrounding him, although slowly fading away. Thaddeus thought that the woman was just making fun of him, when he noticed something odd. The air was equally hot and humid as in Ceuta, but there was a smell. A horrible, damp smell. As the mist faded, Thaddeus heard noises around him, of kids yelling at each other. Sounds of splashing water.\nAnd as the mist had completely left his eyes, he realized that he certainly was not in that small handicraft shop in Ceuta anymore.\nThere was a river, so polluted and so full of trash, that it resembled more a sewer than a river. It was surrounded by houses, which looked more like trash cans, just huts built of materials that can be found abandoned somewhere. And there were kids, floating on the water on small rafts they had apparently built themselves.\nThe bowl the woman had shown him really was one of the powerful artifacts Thaddeus was looking for. But it did not resemble any of the bowls Thaddeus had encountered in his research materials. He did not know what to expect.\nHe was in someone\u2019s dream. But whose was it? And, like the woman had reminded him, it could be a nightmare.\nJust as slippery and difficult to find, dreams are also powerful things. So powerful that they can change the world. Thaddeus was looking for some of the mandkind\u2019s most powerful dreams. The world was ill. It had to be changed.\nBut this dream did not seem to be any of the famous ones he had read about. This place did not seem familiar at all. However, Thaddeus had no choice but to stay. He approached the river where the kids were looking for something in the river. \nPlastic. Their little rafts were full of all kinds of plastic trash, and they were searching for more in the muddy waters. It seemed dangerous. Still, some of the kids dived in from time to time, searching for more treasures. \u201cThis looks expensive!\u201d One of them yelled to the others, waving a plastic helmet above his head.", "created_at": "2020-01-26 15:10:07.420373", "updated_at": "2020-02-05 13:54:43.098140", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 960, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 38.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [766], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [365, 231], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1169, "user_id": 298, "topic_id": 619, "post_number": 1, "raw": "## Unpromted contribution\n\nRail joints.

The sun burnt her skin, made it burst out in bullous rashes, her eyes so sensitive to sunlight, that she had to wear shades not to make them hurt, badly. Girls at school had bullied her, called her names: Hey, Vampire! Do you sleep in a coffin? \nThe giggles, the whispers. She was so used to them now, that it has become a part of her. Like an invisible bubble following her as a toxic atmosphere, always present. The butterflies were fascinating. Strong muscled, extremely enduring creatures, who could fly insane distances, though so fragile and volatile to the eye. Their wings, so beautiful, vulnerable and delicate. Yet these marvellous creatures dared to fly, hundreds, thousands of miles, over land, over sea, as magical creatures from a fairy tale. As a child she had been fantasising about becoming a butterfly herself, to go in to the chrysalis phase, entirely dematerialise into a goo of DNA, and go through this incredible transformation, becoming her rightful self: the imago, a self reliant wonder of beauty, travelling the world, land to land, flower by flower.\nThe fungi were even more complex, she later discovered, demanding the exact right environment to thrive, an existence intertwined with soil, acidity, trees and their complicated root systems. Sometimes, when she accidentally got exposed to light, she imagined her rashes to be a secret species of fungi, spawning at dusk, ripe at dawn. There must be a meaning of it all, the girl in her sometimes thought. That I am evil. I deserve this. I deserve light burning my flesh. Maybe Satan does this, so that I will never forget to whom I owe everything. Perhaps he made a bet with God, when I was born: OK, God, I see that you want to humanely let this child be stillborn. I, though, kind of like her, so if I get Heads, I get to keep her. And God lost her to the dark. For ever.

It is true that Ogene took him because it was thirsty, one day it will get tired and vomit what it has swallowed. \n\nI am remembering Ebuka, my twin brother, who breathed last on the eve of our nineth birthday. He was the fine baby that everybody loved to cuddle. He did not want to be carried about, so he left the world before we all woke up. \n\nI am remembering my mother.

It was not hard to miss him since the bar only had 3 guests and a bartender. The guests was sitting as separated as they could in this big, dark and almost cold room. The stained wooden walls reached high and what might have been windows from the second floor covered the upper part of the walls. I walked straight to the guy with the hat. \u201cRight on time\u201d , he said. I silently sat down. We were both here for the same reason, to bring down the rebels. The hat guy came closer to me and whispered \u201cThey might be watching us from the windows above\u201d. Wow, he is paranoid I thought, but I answered with \u201cLet\u00b4s do this trade discretly then\u201d. I reached for his hand and with a handshake he had gotten what he wanted. Without hesitation he gave me what I was here for. A map leading to a hidden power source from before the war. I could not believe I was holding this map in my hands. If the stories was true, this power source could save the entire world. I politely said goodbye to the hat guy. \u201cBe careful. if that map ends up in the wrong hands it could lead to horrible destruction.\u201d He said. \u201cDon\u00b4t worry, our only option is to restore the balance that was lost in the war, and I will make sure this happens now when I possess the map.\u201d I replied.</p> <p>I walked out and started to contemplate what I just said. Did we really lose the balance, or was it the comfort of having unlimited power and food that created an illusion of balance?

Night time was almost like a ritual as the day unfolded again and again over the glass of bourbon that sat easily in the palm of a well practiced hand.  The politician pondered as the kite string, taught in the other hand, flitted back and forth at the whim of the breeze.  \u201dDid I do good today?\u201d was the only thought of reflection to ever cross the dauntingly logical brain that sat inside the politician\u2019s skull.  You couldn\u2019t say it sat in his skull,  nor could you say it sat in hers.  This was not a question of gender identity or pronoun confusion, but merely the fact that the politician was so unbiased that it made such descriptors unnecessary.  If one day a form was required to be completed by the politician all that could be done would be to add a box at the top and tick it and it would be simply labelled \u201chuman\u201d.  No need for race, gender or economic class but also not to be defined as the politician, after all humanity remained.  Not in the way it is seen by the masses but in its purest form.  This was how the politician became ruler of the human race, unanimously voted by all those lesser mortals who could see how bias held them back.  So the politician sat, alone as always, kite in hand to judge the impact of the day.  Many died, many had suffered, many were born and many lived, all of this the burden born alone by the person sitting in the red chair.  The glass comfortably in hand rose to wet the back of the throat.  A look of uncertainty sat on the face of the person who controlled it all, the politician.\n\n## Prompted contribution\n\n### Prompt\n\n[quote=\"Patienceprose, post:1, topic:352\"] The dead always float between us bringing memories from the past and new thoughts for the moment.

Letting them send you into the future without them but safe in the knowing that the past is always there and that the ghosts are friendly. [/quote]\n\n  \n\n### Response\n\nThe barrier between the living and the dead serves to prevent the ghosts carrying on with you and they become a mere essence of the person they once represented.  A soul trapped in time to help guide you with the lessons that lived within them, the feelings which they created in those they interacted with and the love they lived to share with the world.  There were no dark spirits or evil ghosts the way film or fiction sometimes chose to portray them.  Dark thoughts do not cross the threshold between life and death instead being filtered out by the acquisition of perspective far greater than the living mortal can obtain.  Depression, worry and anxiety are all mortal traits as fear, loathing and vengeance are all mortal feelings.  What value is fear to a ghost? What purpose can depression serve the dead?  I guess for that matter such things don\u2019t really serve the living either but with mortality comes imperfection, ignorance and desire and such things can not exist in a vacuum from the dark side of the human condition.  That is not to say one must give in to these negative possibilities as all possibilities are laid out in front of each living being as a buffet awaiting what will be selected by each decision in the fragile life they cling to so dearly.  Decisions only become reality in the mortal world once someone living bears witness to them or so science would have us believe.  Then again science is yet to formally recognise these ghosts that haunt our minds helping us get through our daily battles with life, mortality and ,hardest of all, with ourselves.", "created_at": "2020-01-02 04:39:32.093732", "updated_at": "2020-02-06 14:16:56.040069", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 673, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 2.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [689], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2854, "user_id": 183, "topic_id": 931, "post_number": 4, "raw": "She began by describing the armor -- not really her department, but her mousy associate in R&D had assured her it would capture the attention of the pigheaded, military crowd, in a way that mere anatomy wouldn't.

Those are slippery things, my friend. They are not always easy to find. Are you certain that bowl is not what you are looking for?\u201d\n\nThaddeus humored her. He looked again at the bowl, turning it slowly within his hands. The metal was good quality, although slightly tarnished in places, most notably the bottom where countless fingers had held it just as he was. Still, it was not what he was looking for. He held it out to the woman. \u201cI am certain.\u201d\n\nThe old man on the floor hide a smile as he turned away. He said something, although Thaddeus did not understand his words; whatever language it was he spoke, it was not Arabic or English or Spanish, or any language that the professor could put a name to.

But when Thaddeus turned to leave she bid him wait.\n\nShe filled the bowl with water and brought it back to him, handing it to him once more. \u201cLook again, my friend.

He paused and looked again more closely. The bowl spun in his sight and the water pulled away, a white mist taking its place. He squeezed his eyes shut again and took a few breaths, but when he opened his eyes once more the mist was still there. Curious, Thaddeus leaned in. He could almost see something through the white and he leaned closer.\n\nBy the time Thaddeus realized he had fallen into the mist, it was too late and there was no stopping it.

He looked at his wrist, tried to read the folds in his skin that appeared when he bent his hand upwards, lines resembling the hexagram lines of the I Ching. \n\nWhen he was young, there were summers where by the end of them he could read the amount of time he had spend outdoors by taking off his watch and comparing the skintone of his hand with that of his wrist.

Nothing.\n\nThe sound of a phone startled him. \u201cFuck, where is it?\u201d He reached in his pockets even though he knew it wasn\u2019t there.

He was obsessed with Star Wars. A franchise so cruelly crushed by stepping beyond the unwritten rule of never going beyond a trilogy. But, then again, that was kind of the point of being a franchise. Ah well. Money. Money. Money! Before Carla launched herself into a galaxy of thoughts that were far far away she returned Francis' mug to the table. She placed her hand gently on top of Francis' and looked back into the soulless pools.

It was an old flat with just one bedroom, a dirty kitchen, and a living room that smelt stale. The floor inside felt exactly like the pavement outside. The place felt less like home, more like another planet.\n\nYet, this was where Josie's mother grew up. As a little girl, Mother lived with ten siblings in this apartment, eating, sleeping and playing on the floor. The only time they sat at the table was to study. \n\nIn the corridor outside, Josie listened to the storm raging inside the flat. Mother came here once a week to clean for Granny. Every week, she found something new to yell at her for. Josie usually waited outside until the storm had died down.\n\nToday, it ended quickly. Josie stepped inside and sniffed the air. Her mother had set aside a new paintbrush and some yellow paint to coat the walls of her grandmother's kitchen. The two women were in the bedroom, going over the old lady's weekly expenses. \n\nJosie didn't waste time. She set to work, ignoring the miniature stone deities that glared at her from across the room, and painting each stroke as her mother had taught her \u2013 always going in the same direction, never using too much paint. \n\nHer mother would take a while. Granny always had problems with her finances. Mother had to make sure that money had not made its way into the hands of any gold-diggers, whether they were shopkeepers or friends. \n\nWhen Josie was nearly done, something on the stove caught her eye. At first, she tried to ignore it, thinking it might be another one of those deities, a fire god or something that had the power to grant culinary riches. But eventually, her curiosity got the better of her. Setting her brush aside, she looked closely. It was not a miniature god wedged in the stove\u2019s biggest burner, but a small image of a woman, burnt to hell. Perhaps it was a goddess. As soon as Josie\u2019s fingers touched it, she realised it was a photo of a woman, cut out from a larger one.

Not figuratively, literally.\n\nFrom when I was a small child and throughout my life, everytime I'm really sick I'll have the same basic recurrent fever dream. In the dream I am forced to tightrope walk on a thin red line stretching across a dark and dangerous sea below. Invariably I walk across the line, but fall off because of its tentative, immaterial nature, and I plunge into the roiling darkness below. The sea is made from pure darkness and is so much more powerful than I am. My tiny body is thrown hither and forth. I am powerless.\n\nI've come to see that dream as being a signifier to the lived experience of being human. Everything that happens in a dream is self. If you meet your mother in a dream, it's not actually your mother, but a representation of your own mother nature that comes to have a talk. And so in the way I interpreted the dream, my tiny body that gets tossed about is my conscious understanding of self: the part of life that this thing I name 'I' has access to, my thoughts, beliefs, choices, sensations etc. And the vast roiling ocean beneath me is unconscious existence, the greater 'I' that knows no limits but is inaccessible to that smaller I; hence dark and seemingly dangerous as all things unknown to us appear.\n\nAfter many weeks on a quiet sea, it would seem that the storm has finally found me and given me the opportunity to fully live my nightmare as an actual experience. There is a part of me that laughs, the adult who has done the work to recognize conscious awareness as both real and not real, and who relishes this opportunity. And there is the frightened child, a scared animal coming to terms with its minute nature, a mote of dust lost in the storm, whose life is either forfeit or spared depending little on any choice of their own.\n\nThere is not one of them that's more I than the other, and at this point all they can do is huddle together, in this insufficient shelter bound to the raft, because they only have each other and it's nice to have company when having tea with Death.\n\nAnd the mind expands in that loving embrace, and for a while is more vast and fathomless than the ocean itself.", "created_at": "2020-03-31 13:00:04.760963", "updated_at": "2020-03-31 13:00:04.760963", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 408, "wiki": false, "reads": 23, "score": 4.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 612, "user_id": 136, "topic_id": 300, "post_number": 1, "raw": "## Unpromted contribution\n\nIn the midst of the chaos happening around him, John stayed perfectly still at the spot he was standing at.

The air inside was cool and still, the only sound that of small hammers against silver, and the soft murmur of tourists marvelling at the skills of the smiths.</p> <p>Thaddeus had been waiting on a bench on the upper level for an hour. No tourists made their way here, kept out by a velvet rope across the staircase, and a small boy with a very serious demeanour. The letter from Solkov had allowed Thaddeus entrance.</p> <p>From inside the doorway in front of him, there was silence. The smith had stopped working. Thaddeus rose from the bench and met the woman in the doorway. The bowl she handed him was small and round, the surface smooth and soft. Old-fashioned tools had created something a factory could never reproduce. \u201cDo good to people and you\u2019ll enslave their hearts\u201d was written in Arabic around the base, in small black, precise letters.</p> <p>The bowl seemed to twist in Thaddeus\u2019 hands, and when he looked up, the wall beside him retreated in a haze of heat that wasn\u2019t there. He squeezed his eyes shut. The Modafinil was a sharp taste at the back of his throat. He took a few deep breaths. The bowl settled back into it\u2019s regular shape. \u201dIt\u2019s not what I\u2019m looking for\u201d, he said, opening his eyes.

She started walking along the staircase, her long white dress was waving in the air. Suddenly she turned right into a smaller hallway. It smelled of old wood and a scent of mint was in the air. Unable to see, Thaddeus slowed down trying to work out where he was walking along. At the end of the hallway there was a little room. On the floor there was a big, red carpet as well as a little wooden box. The woman sat down, pointing down on the floor. Thaddeus sat down with her. She started starring into his eyes, Thaddeus felt like she was looking through his soul. \"I can see you are longing for something, is it love, freedom or is it wealth?\", she asked. Thaddeus did not know what he should say, he was not really sure what he was looking for. \"I do not know what is it, I just want to feel. I want something to dream for\", he said. \"The past is a dream, the future is a wish\", she replied. \"You may just look in the past to see what you are really dreaming for\". The past - for Thaddeus something he did not want to look back on. The pain was too strong. \"There were no dreams in my past, only misery and pain\". \"The power is to find the light in moments of darkness\", the woman answered. \"Wait, I will show you something\". Slowly the woman pulled a little key out of her pockets and opened up the little box in front of her. In the box there was a little mirror, covered in dust. \"The human is the mirror of the human\", it was written on the top, in small letters. \"This mirror is holy, if you ever want to get to know your soul, if you ever want to get to know your dreams, then look into this mirror and you will see\", she said and left Thaddeus there sitting on the carpet.

Those servers picked up their orders at the same time, as always. Pass looked like Rosetta stone. With all those papers that needed to be decipher. So Marcus just informed \"we are not taking orders for some time\". Next ten tables were done before we heard his voice again. Irritated severs send their representative, manager Eric to reason with this machine that no longer worked as the wending machine. Very calmly their conversation went. \"I'm not sending out something that could destroy our reputation. Or lower somebody's fine dining experience. I've said it before: organise better.

I wasn\u2019t expecting this. It\u2019s Sunday night, it\u2019s right before Christmas, I saw this call on Twitter and clicked on the link and was not at all ready to write something from scratch. So if you\u2019ll forgive me I\u2019ll share some end-of-year thoughts from the trenches of the latest social movement in France. So here I am sitting in Paris, and we\u2019ve had these public transport strikes for the past few weeks. A year ago it was the yellow vests. It\u2019s too early to say the strikes have brought the city to its knees. Three weeks ago I kind of anticipated that I\u2019d have something wise and macro to say about the movement by now, on the eve of Christmas, and that confidence came from my memory of the last month-long strike over pension reform in Paris, back in 1995.</p> <p>Well, 1995 was another era and things feel very different this time round. Back then we didn\u2019t have phones & 10 different types of micro-mobility. 1995 was a cold winter, and a very long strike, about 6 weeks. But it felt more orderly. This time there is a kind of gritty chaos that has made the long cross-town walks feel a bit more\u2026 well, gruelling? Or never-ending? You might say, why can\u2019t everyone cycle? Well, it\u2019s chaos, bike accidents are up 40%. Velib bicycles are in short supply. The walking is odd. People get into a trance-like stride. After an hour or more of walking you\u2019re just focused on getting to the end. Nobody has the patience to adapt to anyone else, so people crash into eachother, or almost, constantly. In 1995 the mood felt lighter. People commented on getting fitter. On feeling more connected with their community.</p> <p>I actually really wish I could say what\u2019s happened is \u201cWe Make the Road By Walking\u201d, the title of a book by Paolo Freire and Myles Horton. That it\u2019s a pleasure when you focus less on the destination. But the honest, banal truth is this.

Here I am putting one foot in front of the other cruising past my present without ever being \"here\". Another quote comes to mind \"Way up is the same as the way down\". Oh, how wrong can Heraclitus be from the perspective of lone walker who is aching to be somewhere, anywhere. And yet, we are always in between. Not there anymore nor somewhere still.

However, I rely on logic and structure to solve creative problems. With that said, \"Xero\" is not influenced from Theatre. I was a pro gamer (before it was cool), playing the game called (in the original Playstation), \"Megaman X4\". It is considered the \"best game\", in the series, for many. I enjoyed playing the character, \"Zero\", who used cool laser swords (not LIGHTSABERS) to destroy enemies, through melee attacks. His partner, \"X\" carried an energy blaster and eliminated enemies, through range. Naturally, I developed a chemistry between both characters because they both \"saved\" the world to achieve the same results (through different methods). It didn't help when both characters had different endings! To progress the narrative, Zero scarified himself to save X from a deadly opponent, before X proceeded to defeat the final boss and honor Zero in death.

He lived in a small cottage that was just a kitchen and one additional room, the house was painted red with white on the corners of the house and around the windows as is traditional in sweden. The house had no electricity and no running water and to be honest it wasn\u2019t really fit for living in, but Sven didn\u2019t care he had lived there for most of his life. He was an octogenarian by the time the sixties started and he had decided he would live out the end of his life in that cottage. He didn\u2019t live there by himself though. He had a housekeeper, a man that no one seemed to remember the name of. Looking at it with modern eyes it is safe to assume he was more than a housekeeper ,but while homosexuality wasn\u2019t a crime by the time the sixties began it was still considered a mental illness. What made Sven peculiar had very little to do with his supposed relationship with his housekeeper. It was said he could communicate with animals, he had apparently befriended a badger that had tunneled under his cottage and made its home under the floorboards. He was also a wise man and people said he could close wounds and heal the sick with various remedies. One morning a mother seeking help for her child\u2019s ear infection found him dead, he had apparently died in his sleep. The nameless housekeeper was nowhere to be found. [/quote]\n\n  \n\n### Response\n\nBut what could I tell you about his dreams or hopes?\nNo one knew sven behind the masks that he chose to wear, no one that could tell more about what kind of person he was. Only a shallow impression marked by a lingering perception of a partial judgement. The badger he befriended, was it drawn to this indifference the world held towards him?

Beads of sweat carve through her grimy skin and as she swipes them away, she nearly stabs her own eye out with the screwdriver she holds. No matter! Nothing can get her down today. She shoves the plug into the extension cord and steps back to admire her handy work; her store's new sign is an entire sheet of corrugated metal speckled with LED lights so that **Wishes for Fishes** flickers like light filtering through deep water. Such an upgrade from the sign that Uli used to prop atop her van was a cruddy slab of cardboard inked with drying markers and speckled with seagull shit.\n\nGathering up her toolbox, she scurries to the back entrance that leads to the backroom of her shop. When she flicks on the hanging, naked bulb, its dim yellow light wavers and roils. She has made an aquarium of the backroom, and the length of every wall from ceiling to floor is encased in water encased in glass. Right now there is only the great shadowed coil of the infantile L\u00f3ng dozing under an aesthetically broken pot, and three fish swimming languidly, but she hopes that soon they will have greater company. When Uli taps the glass on her way to the restroom to scrub herself clean, the colourful shape of the Eartheater Cichlid taps its snout to her fingertip and then belches out smoky wisps of partially digested heartbreak. Soon, she croons, soon I will take you new friends.\n\nThe shop itself is shaped like a shoebox. Despite being underground, it gets decent light. The mirrors that Fabian installed around the narrow windows near the ceiling reflect in enough sun that she wouldn't need any artificial lighting in the day. In a corner through the small rectangle of floor grates on which the cat (also inherited, came with the building) dozes, the flickering flames give the store a warm, homely glow. \n\nStar charts and accupuncture maps and talisman written in red ink on yellow hellnotes plaster the walls. They are obscured here and there by the plants that crest the shelves and spill over in spindly leaves and coy curling vines. The shelves themselves were stuffed full of oddities and banal-but-useful knickknacks alike. The drawers nearest her counter are stuffed full of the usual love spells and woven charms for financial security, and the bronze bells that hang on childrens' satchels to scare off spirits and ghosts. The glass counter itself is wiped clean and gleaming. Only her old Macbook occupies its surface but within there are neat knots of wires and chargers and gizmos, for the more modern wishes.\n\nUli perches on the stool behind the counter, fidgeting excitedly. Finally! Opening day!\n\n\n[[Hello! I'd like to try an RPish game with y'all wherein I play a shopkeeper who sells wishes big and small.

I feel illeterate because I know that I can't spell very well. But, since this is private, nobody has to know right?*\n\n*I am so bored. I woke up at 6 and there was nothing to do. We are not allowed to go outside because the government says so. I keep walking back and forth from the house to the studio. Its the only time I get some air in this concrete jungle. I now realize how much bricks there is, all around. If I have to see greenry I have to drive out to the fields or the beach. But of course there is no beach on the way to the supermarket and we have a curfew now so if the police stops me, I won't be able to tell them why. Might as well stay home. Anyway I pulled a book off the shelf today, one of those Black and White photography books Ron gave me for my birthday last year. I never even opened it. It smells like an air-conditioned room. Ariel started talking about someone called Ansel Adams a few days ago. I didn't know who that was. These photographers always have to make everything so academic. Everything has to have a meaning. I feel stupid when I\u2019m with them. Do photos always have to have a meaning? I just want to take pictures. That so bad? Do i really need to know about other photographers?*\n\n*I think I will do some macro photography today. Sun is hot now but later. There is nothing else much to do and I don't like eating.

He stands there, mouth agape and disbeliving. He pushes the door that is no longer being held close by anything. As he is about to board tue elevator, Dave changes his mind as the idea of the elevator vanishing seemed silly but dangerous considering what has been happening.\n\nHe uses the stairs and heads down. It was two flights down that it happened. His next stepped failed to land, as he found himself falling. But not down the steps. He kept falling, the world around him going dark.\n\nHe jolted awake.

In our work we explore new ways of collaborating and creating through the use of new technology and novel social practices.\n\nWe have gotten a grant from the Swedish Arts Council to explore how digital ethnography can enhance collaborative creative processes online. We are currently building a team for this project, and that is where you come in.\n\n**The Project**\n\nBabel Between Us is a cartographic visualization of a collaboratively created fiction. A group of around 20 writers collectively improvise a story on an online forum over approximately 6 months. As they follow this collaborative writing exercise from beginning to end, a team of ethnographers (including you!) code and analyse the story on the platform, and those codes are automatically visualised as an interactive network map. We use the codes to build an interactive network of collective associations, mixing ethnography and network science to produce a visualisation of the story. This map is then presented back to the group of writers throughout the process. The final map is also presented as an interactive artwork in itself which the general public can explore.\n\n**You**\n\nWe are looking to hire two ethnographers to collaborate with us on this project. This would run for about six months on a part-time basis (about 20% of your time). The position pays 28,000 SEK total.  \n \n**Requirements:**\n\n* Trained in the theory and practice of ethnography.\n* Comfortable performing online ethnography.\n* Experience with qualitative data analysis, specifically qualitative coding. The software is unimportant as we have our own, which you will be trained to use.\n* An open mind and a creative spirit \u2013 this is a highly experimental project and a non-traditional ethnographic environment. It will be a learning process for all involved and you will be co-creating a new artistic practice as well as performing analysis on that practice. \n* Ability to collaborate with other ethnographers.\n* Flexibility and willingness to engage in productive dialogue around coding decisions\u2014 good communication skills are a must.\n* Strong organization skills \u2013 must be available for weekly check-ins and document coding choices in a shared open codebook.\n\n \n\n**Tasks**\n\n* Code the story as it unfolds, using a tool we built in-house called Open Ethnographer.\n* Build an ontology of relevant codes, appropriate to ethnographic coding of the story, and keep a detailed and organized codebook.\n* Collaborate with other ethnographers to maintain a consistent coding ontology.\n* Help to compile an ethnographic report (or other kind of medium to present your reflections) at the conclusion of the project.\n* Participate in the discussion towards improving both Open Ethnographer and the SSNA methodology.\n* Discuss the artistic and explorative evolution of the project and help design future iterations\n\n \nThe work will take place from January 2020 to June 2020. \n\n\n\n**Where will the work happen?**\n\nThe majority of the work will be done remotely. You can do the work online, from wherever you are.\n\n\nThe exception will be an ethnographic methods training in January, for which the project will pay for travel and accommodation. \n\n\nIf you happen to be in Brussels or Stockholm, you can also come work at the Reef or Blivande (our workspaces), but that\u2019s not a requisite. We coordinate and communicate through the Edgeryders platform.\n\n\n*If you are interested and believe you fit the criteria, please email [amelia@edgeryders.eu](http://amelia@edgeryders.eu) with a CV and a letter describing yourself and telling us why you want to work on the project.*\n\nPlease feel free to comment below with any questions! \n\nIf you feel that this project is interesting but that you\u2019d rather be one of the writers, please let us know and we will send you the application when it\u2019s out.\n\n---\nHere follows our original application for the project which describes it in more depth:\n\nBabel Between Us is a cartographic visualization of a collaboratively created fiction. A group of around 20 writers collectively improvise a story on an online forum during an extensive amount of time. The resulting fiction is analyzed by a team of ethnographers and presented as an interactive web-based map. This map is then presented back to the group throughout the process. The final map is also presented as an interactive artwork in itself which the general public can explore.\n\n**Theoretical Exploration**\n\nWe want to explore new ways to create and present collaboratively written literature. The best way to present a collective creative process is not necessarily in traditional form, but the nature of the process itself may require entirely new media formats to make the content comprehensible.\n\nBy presenting a co-created story as a map, we allow the spectators to explore the world the writers have collectively created. Because they themselves interact with the fiction and find their own ways through the maze, we break up the linear narrative we are otherwise accustomed to. Since the map of the connection between the various posts is the basis of the experience of the work, the written text becomes secondary to the actual story.\n\n**Collaborative Process**\n\nWe let twenty invited co-writers write a co-created fiction for three, month-long cycles. Writing takes place on an online forum where each new posts and comment is considered a unique item. Each such post has a unique timestamp and sender.\n\nThe writers have no other rules except to follow the principle of \u201cyes, and.\u201d This means that we ask the writers to build on each other\u2019s ideas and not prevent or shoot down each other\u2019s creative processes.\n\n**Digital Ethnography &amp; SSNA**\n\nTo create the map, we use the latest technology in digital ethnography, called semantic social network analysis (SSNA). The process briefly states that a group of ethnographers analyze all the entries that the writers write on the forum, and gives each record one or more tags that can process all the content, from events to mood, tone, and more. Read more on SSNA in this paper.\n\nThese items and tags are visualized in an interactive network graph, which is the basis for the cartographic visualisation.\n\n**Why?**\n\nCollective writing easily becomes unmanageably sprawling because it is difficult for any single participant to embrace the totality of the fiction they co-create. Unlike improvisation theater, live role-playing and other co-created art forms, collective writing takes place as correspondence where many threads are going on at the same time, while the writers are in very different environments and state of mind.\n\nThe role of the ethnographers is then to show the writers an overview of their collectively created fiction. The interactive network graph allows them to see which themes they themselves have been most involved in and which they have not yet explored, and which writers they often interact with and which they not. They also see which themes often occur together and can explore the history they themselves write from angles they have not seen before, allowing them to consciously allow them to converge or branch.\n\nThe writing takes place in three cycles each lasting one month. During the first cycle the writers write without seeing any ethnography. After the first cycle, the ethnographers complete the interactive map, which is then presented to the writers. Then the second cycle begins when the writers continue to write, but now with the map as a reference. After the second cycle, the second round of ethnography is concluded, and the writers then see the new map before they enter the last cycle. Then a final round of ethnography is made to produce the final map.\n\n**The Map**\n\nWe intend to exhibit the final map, both as an interactive web-based map free for internet to explore, as well as a physical piece in an exhibition space. Both of these will be designed in the end of the project, when we have a better overview over the data.\n\nFor the audience, exploring the map becomes a boundless discovery of a world, where you yourself put together how everything is connected. The map becomes a book without beginning nor end.\n\nFor those who want to dive into the methods used all source material will be available, including interactive tools for exploring the graphs in the SSNA software used by the ethnographers. The project will also result in a research report describing how we have developed the technology behind SSNA and its application.\n\n**Collaboration with academia**\n\nThis project is a collaboration with the Edgeryders Research Network, experts at the forefront of using digital ethnography to understand the depths of online conversations. Through having ethnographers and network scientists from Edgeryders on the team, we have access to the software, methods, and expertise that make SSNA possible to implement.\n\n**Final thoughts**\n\nThe project creates a new artistic practice where collaborative processes and new technology reinforce each other. The basis of this practice is the self-reinforcing feedback loop that arises in the interaction between the writers and the ethnographers. In this way, we explore the possibilities for how literature and ethnography can interact in new forms of expression, while at the same time testing the boundaries of both areas.", "created_at": "2019-09-13 15:21:00.619239", "updated_at": "2020-06-02 01:55:56.128872", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1565, "wiki": false, "reads": 75, "score": 670.0, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 6, 96, 215], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3965, "user_id": 144, "topic_id": 1248, "post_number": 3, "raw": "My heart rate was going infinitely up and I turned on the radio.

She wasn\u2019t a gardener; the yard was her space to listen to birds and indulge in a cigarette or two. Lavender became the natural choice of wall colour when they decided to decorate the nursery. It wasn\u2019t until there was distance between them that Sue had recognised Karen\u2019s subtle scent of lavender. Often truth is only recognised in an absence. Sue felt an affinity with voids, they gave meaning, or maybe from them, she found meaning. Either way, she had always associated more with absence than presence. Absence gave room for growth, presence was often stifling.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be in with your pills soon, and some water. It\u2019s nearly time for breakfast.\u201d The doorway voice.\n\u201cWhen I picture myself,\u201d Sue had told a therapist once \u201cI see an untethered balloon in a storm.\u201d There was silence. The therapist had been unhelpful. Another time she had tried to explain how she felt like a container being filled with water, but instead of the water being shaped to the container, the container was shaped to the wishes of the water. The therapist asked her why she was filling containers with water.\n\"I need to watch you take these, they are working.\" \nPills.\nTherapy had only reinforced her sense of shifting nothingness, of a empty fluidity within what should be her. I am not an I.\n\n## Prompted contribution\n\n### Prompt\n\n[quote=\"MikhailGalatinov, post:1, topic:294\"] <p>Dave Pilsen looked at his wrist in bewilderment. He was sure he put on his watch watch this morning. He could still feel the cold of the steel on his wrist,but now it was gone. Strange. He lost his watch. Same way he lost his cup of coffee yesterday, just as he was taking a sip, vanishing. Or his briefcase that he tossed on the office table, never making a sound as it too vanished before it could land. Dave really couldn\u2019t afford a psychiatrist right now, as he was pretty sure he was losing his sanity. He decides to just go home.</p>  <p>He packs his things and makes his way to the door and turns the knob, as nothing happens when the knob he was holding simply wasn\u2019t there anymore. He stands there, mouth agape and disbeliving. He pushes the door that is no longer being held close by anything. As he is about to board tue elevator, Dave changes his mind as the idea of the elevator vanishing seemed silly but dangerous considering what has been happening.</p>  <p>He uses the stairs and heads down. It was two flights down that it happened. His next stepped failed to land, as he found himself falling. But not down the steps. He kept falling, the world around him going dark.</p>  <p>He jolted awake. Finding himself in the middle of a dark room, illuminated only by a few torches.

He realised now, that the form standing over him was just a shadow puppet of a true femininity. The truth was, in fact, now walking towards him. He was scared. He was comforted. He was confused and aroused and relieved and embarrassed and and and... He was so many things, an indescribable conglomerate of emotions pulling him inside himself, his stomach a breeze block in quicksand. He tried to pinpoint what he was feeling, but everything was completely entwined, his thoughts, his impulses, his emotions. He was a small boy, he was an angry man, a lost youth, a scared adult, an embittered old man. He didn\u2019t know who he was. He wanted to destroy, to be nourished, to be cut free, comforted, consumed, rejected, absorbed. No, he was absorbed, wasn\u2019t he?\nShe stopped.\n\u201coh, poor baby! He is speechless! Oh the poor little thing.\u201d\nThe hall erupted in laughter, a cacophony of mockery.  \nHe tried to move, to get a bearing on his setting. Pushing his palms to the cold floor, he sat up. There was no one there. The room embodied a sense of aftermath, an emptiness which only occurs after lively occupation suddenly departs. There was an abrasive silence. He felt the cold steel of his watch on his wrist. Then remembered he had lost his watch. Then remembered that the watch he wore was not metal, it was plastic. Now he thought of it, he remembered it ticking, but knew that it did not, it was digital. The more he remembered the ticking the louder it became, it was there, on his wrist, the ticking. When he looked there was no watch. There was a metal handcuff and a chain, and the ticking stopped. This was how his memory of wearing the watch he had never owned felt; he had felt this feeling before. How was it possible to feel again something that you had not yet felt?

Three days, and no writing. Not that I liked the writing. I was enjoying mostly pasting nonsense photographs that I had taken and printed out. No one to judge the work. It had taken me at least the last month to get to that point and now, the journal and my photographs were gone. And today I had an exciting story to tell.\n\nA hush had fallen over the neighbourhood. No one was on the streets. Not even to walk over the fence of a neighbor. The heat of the days was growing intense. And then, last night, Jupiter had decided to create a play for us all.\n\nI have no idea how some parents choose names for their kids. All I can say is that these parents create their own fortune or misfortune in that initial naming ceremony. Jupiter? It sounded like it belonged to a dog. But to give him that quality would be a fallacy. He was far from it. Perhaps a cat. Jupiter the cat.\n\nMost of the neighbours bore witness to last night's occurrences through their windows or squatting in darkened porches. Jupiter lived opposite my home, with his parents. He was throwing a tantrum again. At twenty-seven, he was still at that stage of development where his parents were responsible for the drudgery that was his life. His mother, a school teacher and his father a government officer in agricultural services or something of the sort, were quiet people. They were retired folk, closing in on seventy. Sometimes people's bodies tell them that they aren't supposed to have children. Their bodies scream at them to stop the attempts to procreate. Yet they continue. And Nature, eventually giving in to their perseverance, grants them that little bundle. Blessed are they when the child is born and their joy knows no bounds. And then, he becomes Jupiter, this hateful, always malcontented child whom the world is supposed to revolve around. Nothing is ever of his own making. Rather, his father never had time to take him fishing. Jupiter always had the latest brand name clothes and shoes mind you. Or his mother never baked. The pizzas and the birthday parties they threw for their only son every year were not important to him.\n\n\"All I wanted from you was time,\" he cried, the little twenty-seven year old pansy.\n\nI woke up still furious about the slamming of doors and the storming off that he did through the gate and out onto the empty street.\n\n\"Selfish little shithead!\" I had railed, pacing back and forth. I had felt like driving to the police station to make a report. It would have served him right to have been arrested last night. Even if it was just for being an ingrate.\n\nWhere was the fucking journal!\n\nI pulled out a sheet of copy paper and began to write.

Carl sat on The Big Couch, so named because it was indeed the biggest damn couch any on his friends had or would ever own. It had been touch and go for a while if they would even be able to get it into the house. But it was worth it. It was an awesome couch.\n\nHe could hear laughter and the clinking of glasses from the kitchen. Parties at Richard's and Joanne's house always tended to be centered around the kitchen, at least as the night progressed. Recently, Carl hadn't really felt like socializing, and now he was in his happy place, on The Big Couch, in charge of music, away from that social nexus.\n\nEarlier, a party playlist had been on, compiled by the hosts and enthusiastically added to as more and more people arrived. The Cure, Depeche Mode, Bowie, Velvet Underground, and then later, when the levels of inebriation peaked, people danced around the living room to Chemical Brothers, The Prodigy, and Propellerheads. Not a single person under 30 at this party, no sir. You can always tell from the playlists.\n\nThere was a sizzling sound, and the smell of bacon wafted into the living room from the kitchen. Classic Paul, cooking at two in the morning. For a second, Carl contemplated getting up and walking over to the kitchen. Pasta with bacon and other tasty things was very tempting, and his body would thank him tomorrow if he ingested some salt and fat.\n\nBut no. Someone could claim control over the music. That simply would not do. Carl leaned back in the couch again and skipped to the next song. Friends had told him this was his most annoying habit when he was drunk. He rarely played whole songs.\n\nQueens of the Stone Age was replaced by Helmet. Milquetoast. That riff. It sent shivers down his spine every time.\n\n\"This is a great song,\" a voice said. It took a few seconds for Carl to realize there was actually someone sitting beside him on The Big Couch, and that person was speaking to him. He turned.\n\nA girl, early thirties maybe? Well, woman really, but Carl would probably call them girls until they became lil ol' ladies. She was short, and had spiky red hair and a nose ring. She wore a black top that said \"Fear not\" in simple white letters.\n\n\"I know it's a great song,\" Carl said. \"I picked it.\"\n\"How very modest of you,\" she said, smiling. Her teeth were small and very white.\n\nCarl tried to place her. He thought he knew everyone at the party, all from a circle of friends that he formed more than fifteen years earlier. Of course it had grown over time as various boyfriends and girlfriends and others were pulled into its social gravity well, but it had been a while now since a new permanent addition turned up. Sometimes a temporary partner passed through, but had enough momentum to simply pass by, like a comet. Carl himself had been the source of quite a few of those comets.\n\n\"So, you're in charge of the music,\" she said. \"Taking requests?\"\n\"Depends on the request,\" Carl replied.\n\"Ah. One of those people.\" She smiled again.\n\"One of those people, and proud of it.\"\n\nShe stretched, pushing herself into the couch.\n\"This is very comfortable,\" she said. \"I can't believe I haven't tried it before.\"\n\"You've been here before?\" Carl said.\n\"Many times.\"\n\nThe plot thickened. Carl thought he knew everyone that could possibly have been to this house many times, unless she was someone Richard or Joanne worked with. Somehow he couldn't see her working in a steel plant or as a management consultant.\n\n\"I'm Carl,\" he said, extending his hand.\n\"Angel,\" she replied, shaking his hand. Her hand was warm and dry.\n\"Really? Angel?\"\n\"And with the wings to prove it.\"\n\nShe turned. Her top dipped down low in the back, exposing a black tattoo of stylized wings, all straight lines and angles. It was pretty bad-ass. Helmet, tattoos, great smile.\n\n\"So who are you here with?\" Carl asked.\nShe turned back and smiled at him.\n\"You,\" she said. For a second, Carl saw those black lines push out from her back and spread, stretching from wall to wall, covering the ceiling, and beyond, curving away through the walls. Then they were gone.\n\n\"Fear not,\" she said, \"for I am with you. I will strengthen you and help you.\"", "created_at": "2020-03-11 14:29:54.570407", "updated_at": "2020-03-11 14:29:54.570407", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 763, "wiki": false, "reads": 26, "score": 40.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1274, "user_id": 325, "topic_id": 660, "post_number": 1, "raw": "## Unpromted contribution\n\nMako was up very early that morning.

She imagined the sound of the night, the secrets, the bad words, the confessions and plans made by the drunk and the lonely, the dreams and the regrets of the righteous, the brilliant thoughts that had probably left a trace on every fragment. They could all be contained on those broken scraps, somehow. She felt euphoric. She began walking home. She bought bread and coffee. She opened her apartment door, closed it and went straight to her studio.\nOn her table, a collection of samples was neatly organized: human and other animal skulls, broken paper, fragments of furniture and abandoned clothes, pens, keys, food containers. Next to them, she had the device she had been working on for the last ten years. She plugged everything and prepare herself a cup of coffee. She got ready to run another test.

I remember a little woman running up a hill in cropped trousers. I watched the music video, played, rewound and played again until the VHS tape stretched out of shape.

The families that could be fed with it.\n\nIf the Smith noticed his hesitation, she didn't attempt to reel him in. Thaddeus had found her, after all. That, in itself, showed his commitment.

Years of saving sorted into piles on the coffee table. The odd coin had been discarded.

I don't believe that god(s) involves itself in the lives of the mortals, nor do I believe in the conspiracies drawn up in those dark recesses of YouTube. I think it is so much more complicated than any of those morality tales, so much more richly rendered than the imaginings of humans can fathom. For now, at any rate.\n\nIt is a balance thing, I suspect. There is a scale, a figurative device the old religions used to call fate for lack of a better understanding. It tips, sometimes, one direction or another, on a timescale so vast we cannot conceive it. The big lizards died, so the scale tipped hard to one side, far past the point of the fulcrum. The mammals rose and begat us after countless millennia, with our arrogant dismissal of natural order, of balance, and here we are, chatting in an imagined clone of reality, waiting for the virus to die. \n\nAnd then...then, we will go back to tipping the balance in our favor, out of balance, until eventually we figure out how to break the goddamn thing and perish like the lizards by a comet of our own making. The world will recover, repopulate with whatever carbon-based permutation is fastest, smartest, fucks fastest.

It\u2019s Sunday night, it\u2019s right before Christmas, I saw this call on Twitter and clicked on the link and was not at all ready to write something from scratch. So if you\u2019ll forgive me I\u2019ll share some end-of-year thoughts from the trenches of the latest social movement in France. So here I am sitting in Paris, and we\u2019ve had these public transport strikes for the past few weeks. A year ago it was the yellow vests. It\u2019s too early to say the strikes have brought the city to its knees. Three weeks ago I kind of anticipated that I\u2019d have something wise and macro to say about the movement by now, on the eve of Christmas, and that confidence came from my memory of the last month-long strike over pension reform in Paris, back in 1995.</p> <p>Well, 1995 was another era and things feel very different this time round. Back then we didn\u2019t have phones & 10 different types of micro-mobility. 1995 was a cold winter, and a very long strike, about 6 weeks. But it felt more orderly. This time there is a kind of gritty chaos that has made the long cross-town walks feel a bit more\u2026 well, gruelling? Or never-ending? You might say, why can\u2019t everyone cycle? Well, it\u2019s chaos, bike accidents are up 40%. Velib bicycles are in short supply. The walking is odd. People get into a trance-like stride. After an hour or more of walking you\u2019re just focused on getting to the end. Nobody has the patience to adapt to anyone else, so people crash into eachother, or almost, constantly. In 1995 the mood felt lighter. People commented on getting fitter.

The air is filled with mountains and seas, the reservoir tells of a once great river. The curving streets are lined with trees and people live in shining blocks, the hills appear to grow from nowhere surrounded by life everywhere.\n\nHave you found the Jordan Valley? It\u2019s not too hard to find, though a little out of the way for most, rural is not its mind. Inaccessible, its not, least not to the working class. There\u2019s only one ivory tower, but that might not be built to last.  Those who call for its destruction are noble but wielding bombs, however the valley smiles in kind, for you can\u2019t attack what you can\u2019t find. \n\nThere is anger in the Jordan Valley. Do the holy sites remind us to love our neighbour, or do they force us to stray further.  Once in a storm, the shield of a catholic school flew away. How many villagers saw the shield that day? What did it mean, if a natural disaster could mean, when the windows of the buildings broke revealing the cramped hearts within?\n\nWill you visit the Jordan Valley? It\u2019s as deep as the rift between its residents and might not be long to fare. The poor, the rich, the policeman, the youth rub shoulders chasing buses. There are no trains or planes and for many years no blame but as life begins to change, how will the Jordan valley? \n\nWill its people run away in a great exodus, or will they be here to stay?\n\n\n## Prompted contribution\n\n### Prompt\n\n[quote=\"babelbob, post:1, topic:57\"] You arrive at a spiral staircase, also this one in partly wrought and partly industrial iron, same flaking paint layers retelling uninteresting stories of previous stylistic preferences, its steps disappearing in the distance both above you, and below you. On the railing at the entrance to the staircase sits a large python, wrangled through the iron bars, its scales like pearls, shifting white rose and sky-blue in an instant, big deep-blue eyes observing you with calm, free of judgement. As you start down the staircase the large snake opens its mouth, revealing no teeth and a thin pink tongue, and says something in a soothing foreign language, you start to ask questions but its attention is already directed elsewhere, out in the distance. A couple of mother-of-pearl crows lands next to it, looking at you, then turning and speaking the same foreign language to the python, a single beam of sun breaks through the fogs to turn their feathers shimmering in colours much too many and much to complex for the human eye to perceive in full. You love them. [/quote]\n\n  \n\n### Response\n\nWhy is the python here and what are the crows saying? In their foreign mutterings and deep stares, it's almost as though they are aware of your internal musings. The python returns its attention to you, staring into your eyes. Is it insulted? Is it aware of your internal musings. It slithers up the staircase, flaking more and more paint as it goes. Further and further up the spiral staircase it goes until it reaches the top windows where it rests on a ledge. Watching the python you realize that the ceiling is not iron, nor are the walls. The sides of the ceiling jut inward just slightly, a European design - or perhaps art-deco. \n\nThe crows, aware that their leader has moved, flap their wings in unison and follow in kind. The wind from their wings chip off more of the already flaking paint layer revealing an intricate design just below the current layer of bland modern red. Spirals of greens, mosaics of brown, a palimpsest in the most traditional, and metaphorical, sense of the world. \n\nThe sunlight glints one last time on the wings of the crows, those still flying upward camouflage against the newly revealed tapestry. A moment later, the clouds return to block the sun. The crows return to black and so does the wall.

He glanced up at his Aunt, handbag on her shoulder, in full flight for the Christmas Eve Night service. She was always on time. She hated being late. He felt her slight tremble again and drew even closer. The poorly lit road seems to disappear at times, but his Aunt kept an even pace as if on remote.They were now approaching that bridge he hated. It needed fixing. There was even talk of the bridge being haunted since the unfortunate accident of little Darius, a 5 year old boy who plunged to his death on Christmas Eve night, 2 years ago. He held on to his Aunt even tighter as she strode on fearlessly. They both slowed down as the bridge was now in front of them,imposing and beckoning. What a terribly long drop, if they were to fall over that bridge he thought. He twitched and gripped his Aunt's hand even tigter. By this time the rain had stopped as they slowly began their trek across this worn out bridge. You would think that after that terrible accident they would have fixed it. Still the same worn out rails that shook when you held them. You still had to be cautious where you stepped, especially on a wet night like this one.

He felt as if he was moving in slow motion, expecting his Aunt Odette to snatch him from peril,any time now.

I haven't had it for a while. Like 'the game' I used to play with my \"home\" friends in childhood, the object of the game was to forget the game to the point of it fizzling out. But someone would remember (and I was as guilty as any - it was a game after all) and remind the rest. And so it was with this dream, I was locked in an endless desire for it to stop plaguing me and the more I focused on not focusing on it the more it seemed to be focused on making sure I could do nothing but focus on it. Like one of those dreams where you're trying to climb up an impossibly steep street and your fingers are clinging on, but you keep slipping down and your knees are raw from the friction of the hardened surface that scrapes across them like sandpaper . And your finger tips are almost non-existent because you're trying so desperately to hold onto something, *anything*, and where soft pads might once have been there is nothing but open, stinging, flesh with no hope of recovery and still you're slipping**. And there is no one around to either witness or assist your demise because it is all in your mind and symbolic of your own struggle with life, the universe and everything and, genuinely, nothing anyone else could ever help with anyway.\nThis dream was exactly that manifestation. But now, when it starts, I have this incredibly bizarre sense of watching it unfold before me and knowing I am in a dream but being unable to do anything about it. It starts at the docks, a misspent youth smoking weed and watching The Wire undoubtedly plays a role in the kick off point. But then I am seamlessly transported onto a ship. A cruise ship. It is plush. The carpet is a nauseating combination of colours, I'm told this is their trick to help any seasickness incidents to blend in. I want to be sick in my mouth at the thought of it. The ship is vast and while I am sure I was greeted and escorted onboard there are no people any more. It is a ghost ship and entirely devoid of life yet continuing to sail, somehow, in the middle of the ocean. It is night. The darkness holds a pitch that cannot be comprehended without experiencing it. The kind that people think they know but never do know until they really know. Then, suddenly, I am not on the empty ship any more. The night remains. It is waiting to envelope me along with the ocean. I am falling. Falling. Falling. \nI fall from the back end of the ship. I fall for what feels like....an eternity? No, let's not be dramatic here. I fall for long enough to know that I am falling a bloody long way. I fall for long enough to hear the sea before I hit it. I fall for long enough to be able to see the whole of the rear of the ship before I can't any more only, now, it is alive with life and people are in their cabins and on the decks and dancing and it is still dark and cold and the middle of the ocean but the ship is buzzing with light and life. \nNo one sees me fall, it is just the same as when I am trying to climb that steep road. I think a million thoughts before that was crashing over me and yet I remember not a single one and then I hit the water. It is freezing and shocks me and I struggle for breath from that point onwards. I struggle for everything from that point onwards.  The wash from the ship is so huge it creates waves big enough to belong in a storm and it tosses me, effortlessly, under and up again. I can't breath and the last thing I think, as I see the ship disappearing from my view with it's little twinkling lights, is that this is not the way it was meant to be. This was not meant to be my end! They say it is a perfect murder! To lose a person off the side of a ship at night. You'll die from hypothermia or drown long before a ship that size can turn around and that's only if they know you went off the side.\nThis is my own perfect murder. Slowly sinking. All of a sudden seeing everything around me with an ethereal clarity that I can never achieve in my waking hours. I want that clarity. I want to see the world as I do in those moments before I wake up screaming where I lie. I want to feel my hair flowing around me in that effortless way that I can never achieve outside of the water. I want to feel hydrated in the way that you can only feel when you're submerged, is this  a primal desire that takes root when you're in the womb?\nThis dream is back now.

I started to starve.\n\nOn the wall a picture of Hummus and pita bread was hung and on the bottom of them there was a written phrase: \"The weight you gain from falafel is a weight that you should not regret\". I got scared and  remembered my t-shirt and my brother again. I don\u2019t know whether these are delusions and my mind try to remind me not eating too much and gain weight or it is a cosmic game and coincidence that has no meaning.anyway, As long as i am a person who doesn't believe in superstitions, I will buy it even if the customers are going to stop behind me like a choir to chant: (Don't buy falafel, you will gain more weight).\n\nI watched the chef preparing to remove the falafel from the huge frying pan. Then a loud sound came from outside which made everyone in the restaurant to go out to see what had happened. It was a collision of two cars were completely destroyed. The falafel was burned as well, so I was told that next falafel takes 15 min.\n\nI went home and was thinking. I am not bothered by not getting falafel, but rather, I was bothered by the fact that I  refused to eat it from the beginning, so it refused me in turn.\nSomeone rang the bell. he was Ralph standing at the door  holding a white bag.

It\u2019s just one of those peculiarities, that my empty eyes are purely decorative. I can hear through my hard ears, feel touch on my chiseled skin and smell through my shallow nostrils. But I can\u2019t see through my eyes. I remember a time when I could, before my colors wore off and left my naked body, hair and eyes the same shade of pale ivory white. As the green color of my iris and the olive pit black of my pupils faded, so did my vision. So when they come to visit, there is always a moment of uncertainty as I hear footsteps approaching through the grass and fallen leaves. Today it was raining, so the footsteps were even softer, dampened by the lighter tips and taps of raindrops on foliage.</p>  <p>Light footsteps and hesitation are good news. Doubt is natural when one is alone with me. Boots and brash voices are not good news. My generously chiseled assets had so far been spared from the swords and hammers of brash men in boots, although it had been a close call on occasion. I have heard angered shouts of blasphemy and whispered jokes of envy. Are they also envious of their horses? Perhaps it\u2019s my unyielding readiness that angers them. In any case, I was hidden in the forest long ago to keep me from destruction. My ivory white skin has an unusual glow and fragrance for my age, rubbed as it is with bodies, oils and perfumes.

I would breakfast and complete my morning routine quickly, so I could visit him later and apply the mineral oil, then a light rubbing of perfume-scented cloth over smooth limbs and joints. I admired the way the sun shone over his limbs, the curls of his hair... And with the droplets of the fallen rain coating the surrounding trees like shining diamonds, he seemed to be the guardian of some lost, almost divine treasure in this hidden glade. \n\nMy father and brothers would laugh and jeer when I went out here to read, calling me 'milk-sop' and 'weakling', as I was drawn more to history and learning than their athletic and warlike pursuits as in their minds, a proper man should be. And yet, though they threatened to break him or remove him, it was revealed by a local historian that the age of this statue was that of a true relic, a piece of a time long ago, and considered anathema to even consider breaking or even moving from the location. It did not stop them from mocking me, but I did not care a whit for their opinion. \n\nAs it was that morning, the birds had indeed visited him, and he needed a bit more care in his cleaning. But I smiled through the work, looking up at his handsome visage as I smoothed my hands over his features.

Some began to scratch at the cuts from the glass with the surface of their dull yellow beaks. It felt like sandpaper being rubbed on scrapes. The others were leaving pin pricks on my bare unbroken skin using the tip of those beaks. \n\nThe din continued to rise above my screaming as more screeching birds poured into the room. My vocal chords were active, but I was paralysed with fear. Facing the windowsill. Lying in the fetal position. Feet pointing towards the door a good five feet away. I was trapped, and watching this horror unfold.\n\nThrough the corner of my right eye, squeezed between by my bleeding elbows and the wooden floor, I could see the birds closer to the window trying to stand, and make their way towards me. Each bird that managed to stand was either knocked over, or propelled into a crash, by a new member of their flock. For birds with wings they were surprisingly hard. \n\nTo cover more surface area, the birds nearest to me, began to climb on top with their bodies brushing against my skin. Smooth bodies. Like polished metal. Metal? The realisation was so sudden that I stopped screaming. \n\nI tried to reach out to feel the \"birds\" with my left hand. My fingers managed to brush against one that had fallen over. The underside was cold to touch. Like porcelain. But not fragile, unlike porcelain. Otherwise the birds would have shattered with the force of impact.\n\nMy thoughts were rudely interrupted by a sharp pin prick on my middle finger. \u201cFaack yeoo,\u201d I shrieked, now returning to my screaming. Louder this time, with the pain compounding the sounds of my shock. I had always wondered how things would end. And had a few scenarios in mind. Unfortunately, since alien birds featured in none, I wasn\u2019t quite prepared for this. \n\nJust then, a pair of hands entered the room, grabbed my legs, and began to pull me out.

In fact, she wasn\u2019t sure she was flying either. She might be floating or swimming in an enormous pool of light water. She felt happy, and more energized than she could ever remember being. It was as if her own weight had been lifted, and she was merely a wind moving through a bright vastness free of resistance. Just as she was beginning to get accustomed to her new, carefree existence, something in the back of her mind, or somewhere in the cloudy distance, opened up. A hole of sorts. There were moving colors in the hole, and she could hear muffled sounds. Was it voices? She tried to steer away from it, she wasn\u2019t ready to leave. She was sure that going through the hole would not make anything easier. She even had the feeling that things might in fact get much, much worse. But the hole with the moving sounds and colors grew steadily bigger and she felt herself drawn closer. The hole was soon everything she saw, but she continued to resist.

On the railing at the entrance to the staircase sits a large python, wrangled through the iron bars, its scales like pearls, shifting white rose and sky-blue in an instant, big deep-blue eyes observing you with calm, free of judgement. As you start down the staircase the large snake opens its mouth, revealing no teeth and a thin pink tongue, and says something in a soothing foreign language, you start to ask questions but its attention is already directed elsewhere, out in the distance. A couple of mother-of-pearl crows lands next to it, looking at you, then turning and speaking the same foreign language to the python, a single beam of sun breaks through the fogs to turn their feathers shimmering in colours much too many and much to complex for the human eye to perceive in full.

He stared at the stairway leading up the hill to the lecture hall; it was the same flight of stairs he struggled up every other day, except there was something about the way the high afternoon sun illuminated the cracked, white tiles. Kai felt a pang of recognition.\n\nAnd there was a chill on the nape of his neck, as if someone was watching his thoughts, waiting for him make some kind of connection. \"What connection? To where?\" he muttered breathlessly to himself as he lugged his duffel bag up the final step.\n\nInstinctively, he cupped both hands over his head as he passed the narrow passageway to the lecture hall's back entrance. The mossy pavement was checkered with guano, while the perpetrators chirruped above him, happy and full from lunch. He glanced up to find one giving him a sly, oily side-eye, and shuffled forward even faster. The cleaners had hung CD disks from the balustrade railings, hoping to scare away the birds. But all they did was give him a headache--especially in the afternoon--by sending piercing waves of light into his retinas. Kai ran a hand across the sweaty back of his neck, and was startled to find that his skin was covered in goosebumps. \n\nSomething about those birds, those lights. He frowned, thinking hard, trying to figure out what it was that seemed so familiar.\n\nFinally, Kai reached the lecture hall. The strange sense of foreboding began to lift, only to be replaced by dread. The lecturer walked in. He was an old member of the faculty, with lips so thin he reminded Kai of some kind of animal. And his voice: frustratingly soft, a susurrous mumbling that was only just barely audible.\n\nKai sighed. He might as well do his best, even if it was his worst subject.

It was hard. The loss of the boyfriend and car-scratching sound rough. Maybe for you it is easy.\n\nI can't imagine what you are going through.\n\n I never know who I think I am talking to in moments like these. Anyways, about me then. I'm a full blown adult, with a whole inner adult voice that is kinda nice to the children-me and sometimes they are out in full force, and I wail and tantrum, but with the sweet understanding of my adult self. It sucks sometimes to be so fucking responsible but the consequences are always so much more shitty when I'm not. I feel deadlocked by fate. \n\nbut also lost in deep conversation with myself on the relationship between fate, faith and will. And then obviously the existence of magic and time travel, justice and collective healing.\n\nThere are moments though when the moral relativity of it all gets too much, but not with shades of grey. I find colour is a much better medium for balance than the middle ground of black and white. But yes, I get overwhelmed, sometimes my mind opens so wide that I get lost in ideas that I think I can understand everything and I try to send myself messages for when I come back through the mad happenings with whoever is there to witness me and then I end up institutionalized.  It has been hard without a shaman to guide me. \n\n I've learnt that the self has been a really important anchor for my own sanity.  That bullshit they sell about the ego being a dickhead is the reason so many people think we are suppose to hate ourselves and I promise, what is left to be explored in those territories is pretty competitive. \n\nThe self allows me to find my body and my reality, which is for the best when you are in a straightjacket in a shitty public hospital in a different part of the country and the nurses, who are too cruel to everyone, become scared of you because the straightjacket is pretty comfy. Like hugging yourself.  \n\nMaybe that is why I am an activist. I don't think I would survive if I wasn't trying to change the world because most people around me seem stuck and if I was just being myself I might spend the rest of  my life in an asylum or a weird farm full of white hippies who don't understand that they are not indigo children or have karmic superiority for wanting to escape to the farmlands where they can return to the 'old ways'. but that the land is far beyond the means of the  descendants of the indigenous and slaves who were given drug and alcohol addictions by the government to intentionally fuck them up - this obviously doesn't account for the loss of language, cultural and spiritual practice. Nor does this account for the intentionally inferior education system that still means the vast majority of the country are not equipped for meaningful work from their schooling, the  high levels of all types of violence and so many things that I could rattle off in utter disbelief and grief that I am forced off any idea of the farm of nice hippies who are intentionally unaware of their history because the ignorance allows them to detach and live good vibe lives.\n\nor being lazily melancholic because all pain is equal because I have tried to make sense of that and it is not true. \n\n I don't know if I am projecting again, but I seem to think I help the people around me and a 15 year old just send me a DM the other day to tell me that he did his school assignment on one of my projects because my partner and I are his role models (and he got full marks), so we are setting up a zoom meeting with him and his friends and I think I feel cooler that he does. \n\nI am learning to allow myself to be proud of my achievements, which feels like a historic victory for my people, especially those who pass through my body. Self love is a political act, yo but still, I had a lot of men mentors when I was younger, which accounts for the patriarchal tendencies you might sometimes pickup - sorry bout that I am working on it. \n\nand forgiveness (this one is especially nice for the broken heart) \n\nI hope that by the time I die, I am so spent and also so released that I'll be proud of whoever it is that is housed in the body  and that they can in turn hold this body as sacred in those last moments even if I am scared, insecure, in mourning or joy during a really dull and aged dream or agony from the repeated wound to the head by an unnamed officer or abandoned and alone coughing blood. \n\nI have honored my life.

The green plants meant nothing more to me than what they were- food, medicine, oxygen. For others, like Arium, they meant life, an ecosystem, breathable air, and home. They meant Terra, where they'd been born, many years and galaxies ago. Nothing more than a postcard to me.\n\nI sat and wondered at that, as Arium swept the floors, capturing any lost nutrients that had fallen to the ground. They came from generations ago, a living ancestor, although frozen asleep for most of it. When they'd been awoken, when we'd reached New Terra, they'd all been paralyzed in nostalgia and, the AI told us, shock. Some never recovered, in spite of finally achieving their greatest dream of New Terra.

With my intake of regrettably chewy, tenacious human meat - more sinew and bone than fat and flesh - this a seldom granted privilege. After years of this diet supplemented by the livestock of our underlings, my stomach seems to have finally gotten used to it. Sitting on my enamel throne, I reflect on the ingenuity of our society. As an example, during my previous audience in this room, I discovered a new way to wipe my ass. Preferring to alternate directions of the wipe, I would every other time have to stick my toilet paper-equipped hand in the narrow space enclosed by the seat, my cock and my bulgeous thighs; an ever shrinking space as a result of my diet. Instead, I discovered I could simply engage the sequence by reaching diagonally from the outer side of my right thigh.\n\nOur ingenuity doesn't stop there; this is the society that succeeded in solving the world's hunger crisis. The solution was staring us in the face all along, and it only required the simple observation of an ordinary man: eat the hungry. Always disregarding humanity's ability to invent and adapt, the people of the world always had the most unimaginative vision of society's apocalypse. A common fantasy was the scenario of the mass outbreak of a zombie virus, turning men into beasts that will eat the healthy; how ironic that humanity's solution was the complete opposite.\n\nI hope you won't mistake our bureaucracy of natural selection for cruelty; we treat our livestock with all the affordable respect and dignity. The society in which we live is more often chosen for us, than chosen by us.

Across the mahogany board table sits three suits who are passing judgement on them and the last few months of work, condensed into the pitch that Jack is now delivering. \n\nWell. Saying they're the ones passing judgement on their pitch is like saying that some ears are passing judgement on someones vocal chords for the tune they've just sung. There's a truth to calling the executives 'suits'. They are suited marionettes, carefully conditioned to be the front-end speech organs; putting a human face to the much vaster intelligence hidden behind them. Through the microphone in the middle of the table, Hugo tries to imagine the corporation and its sense-making apparatus, composed of thousands of meatbags carefully trained to work in unison, and the closely interwoven exaflops of expert systems originally intended to aid them. At some point in the recent past, Hugo muses, the signs on that equation must have flip-flopped, and it's now the suits that aid the expert systems. Their purpose is ever the same though, mapping out the human and natural spheres, extracting physical and information resources and investing them for further exploitation. And the greatest source of wealth is building the map of human behavior. Thus through making and broadcasting games such as this, the map becomes ever clearer, and they pile more wealth ever on to the hoard upon which the technocratic dragon jealously roosts. \n\nA moment of anxiety runs through Hugo's body. He holds no illusions about the much greater scope of the corporation's aggregate intelligence compared to his own. Do they have their number? Has some algorithm deep inside the machine understood their true motive? That they are in fact running a long con with the intent to run a heist on the dragon's hoard, installing their own fledgeling expert system onto the field, becoming true players in the games of power rather than merely another crew of minions. And from there, launch the revolution.\n\nThat was the long game. Right now, right here, they are just getting their foot in the door. Sucking up to the aristocracy, appeasing the dragon, offering them yet another rich feast of information, a new way to process the paste of human nature and exploit it. A treasure map leading to a billion targeted advertising X'es.  \n\n[quote=\"Fel, post:1, topic:1016\"]\nOkay, here\u2019s the million dollar pitch, it\u2019s gonna be a total mindfuck and people will love to watch this.

So things don\u2019t get out of hand. Ha! Talk about when god is among men.\n[/quote]\n\nHe looks to his side where Jack is sitting, his hand-waving animation subsiding after delivering his pitch. Their eyes lock for a moment and meets a searching look. *Did it go well?* Hugo found himself sending back an involuntary facial shrug. *Who knows?*\n\nThe faces on the suits are quiet for a long time. The machine is calculating, no doubt. Hugo feels tension in his shoulders and neck. And just as the pause is going into the third trimester, one of the suits speaks up.\n\n\"Mr Scott, Mr Gearson. That all sounds quite well and good, but how do you intend to give the individual content generator their sense of agency? How do you spin the illusion that the player is in fact the master mind while keeping them under close tabs and controlling their operating parameters?\"\n\nHugo sits forward, leather squeaking. The reaction to the next part will possibly make or break their entire plan.\n\n\"We will make the code book available to them. The whole thing. Concept Networks, Character Co-occurence Graph, Detangler View, Narrative Matrix. They will be able to look into the back-end of the game as it's unfolding.\"\n\nThe mask breaks on one of the suits for a moment. A snicker? A sneer? The micro-expression is gone before Hugo can get a good glimpse.\n\n\"That hardly seems like controlling their parameters, Mr Gearson. Giving them that degree of power sounds quite ill advised\", the suit replies. \n\n\"No, no, it's quite safe,\" says Hugo. \"The data set is much too complex for the player to make sense of. Without the expert systems and algorithms we've annealed to process the conceptual landscape, it will look to them like they are playing Checkers when in fact they are playing Go. They get access to power but entirely lack the means to use it effectively.\"", "created_at": "2020-05-27 07:58:21.952465", "updated_at": "2020-05-28 05:34:11.285021", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 912, "wiki": false, "reads": 24, "score": 49.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [2660], "is_reply_to": [2660], "is_liked_by": [410, 401], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1332, "user_id": 374, "topic_id": 712, "post_number": 1, "raw": "## Unpromted contribution\n\nI loyally, faithfully, carry this passenger.

On arrival to the general store.at the village, he got drunk, slept and got drunk again until every peso from his meagre severance pay was gone.  Then, feeling ill and bad humoured, he went looking for a place to recover and decide what to do next.  Down by the river under the shade of the acacias he setup his poncho as a mattress and his saddle as a pillow.  The flies and the afternoon heat together with a hard ground made for a poor rest.  On the late afternoon he awoke and started getting ready to go back to the village, maybe to church to speak to the Padre, maybe to Mrs Aguero, an elderly widow who lived alone.  Maybe she had some chores, maybe chop some wood, maybe he'll help with her garden.  He cast around to see where his horse had gotten to, when the sound of violence leaked trough the leaves of the trees and the tinkle of the water over the river bed.  Somebody was crying - a woman? Somebody was swearing, he recognised the voice, it was Mr Morales, his old employer, he couldn't be sure...the noise of the water and the wind covered the exchange.  Julio tried to get closer, to get a peak. Hard smacks sounded, flesh to flesh.  Pain in the sobs of the woman, grunts and satisfaction the sounds of the man.  He stood there for an eternity.  He stood rooted to the spot until Morales left and the sobs of the woman where the only sound left in staccato to the choir of the birds on the riverside.  What to do with only one leg? What to do a poor man against the power of the estanciero? What to do with the condemnation in the eyes of the girl? What could he do...\n\n## Prompted contribution\n\n### Prompt\n\n[quote=\"Alcibiades338, post:1, topic:327\"] <p>Yet, with every here, with every now there is something else.

Maybe the King could pick someone new from the lottery once he saw him. There's must be a mistake, for sure.\n\n\"Alright, I'm coming. Let me just get my coat first.\"\n\nBy the time they got to the palace, the sun was at it's highest in the sky. Douglas used to dream about entering the palace when young, but he never thought it would be like that. He didn't know why exactly but he felt deeply ashamed. Once they got inside the tall entrance doors, he immediately saw a small crowd watching him. In the back of the room, there was a man with pale white skin and a crown sitting on a golden chair. It was not the throne, but it was the king for sure. He seemed smaller than Douglas remembered, but last time he had a glimpse of the king was almost a decade ago. The king was still a teenager at the time. Almost twenty years younger than Douglas. That thought made him flinch even more.\n\n\"I present you Mr Douglas Guiles, the King's bride\" the messenger shouted without ceremony. Everyone in the room made a subtle bow - except for the king, of course. That made Douglas feel even worse.\n\n\"Your majesty, there was a mista...\" Douglas tried to start but was abruptly interrupted by the messenger. \n\n\"You shall refrain from speaking in front of the king without being directly asked for!\"\n\n\"But I'm a man for Christ sake!\" Douglas shouted louder than the messenger, who seemed really upset and surprisingly dangerous, rushing towards Douglas.\n\n\"Come closer, 'man'.\" The king spoke imperative, putting some disdain in the last word. The messenger stood still and waved his right arm to permit passage for Douglas. He crossed the immense room with all eyes on him. He could hear some whispers but couldn't see where it was coming from. He stood two feet away from the king and waited silently. The whispering also shut, making the silence almost solid.\n\n\"So, you are saying you can not be what your king needs you to be?\" The king asked slowly, as if daring anyone to interrupt or even whisper.\n\n\"No...

The earth spun in and out of view. \n\u201cCome on, idiot. It\u2019s in your muscle memory. Just flap.\u201d\nWithout a better plan, and with the world rapidly approaching, I thought it was worth a shot. My mind send the flap command to my body, without any real expectations, and my body responded with the instincts borne of millions of years of evolution. \n\nI pulled out of my mad spiral and suddenly I was soaring in the skies, feeling the wind\u2019s currents beneath my wings, flicking my tail feathers gently to stay aloft.\nMy tail feathers?\n\nI lost control again with the realisation, and had to flap madly to get back on an even keel.\n\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d I yelled.

On the railing at the entrance to the staircase sits a large python, wrangled through the iron bars, its scales like pearls, shifting white rose and sky-blue in an instant, big deep-blue eyes observing you with calm, free of judgement. As you start down the staircase the large snake opens its mouth, revealing no teeth and a thin pink tongue, and says something in a soothing foreign language, you start to ask questions but its attention is already directed elsewhere, out in the distance. A couple of mother-of-pearl crows lands next to it, looking at you, then turning and speaking the same foreign language to the python, a single beam of sun breaks through the fogs to turn their feathers shimmering in colours much too many and much to complex for the human eye to perceive in full.

The couple of mother-of-pearl comes closer to you as you go gradually into the python\u2019s mouth. The scent makes you faint for few seconds, and now you are back at the start. The python has closed her mouth, seeing that you are not ready to enter her interiors, to feel the grandiosity of one of the greatest python. One of the mother-of-pearl it\u2019s right in front of you, she emanates a weird aura and her feathers almost blinds you with all the greatness of her existence. You feel small, but the other mother-of-pearl comes even closer and touches you, and that was the smoothest touch and carried more affection than you ever got. You stand up; look in the eyes of the python, take both of the mother-of-pearl and of start to face the stairs one more time. The python seems pleased with your attitude, she speaks once again, but this time even though you did not understand, you felt her. You enters her mouth and discovers her insides where warmer but a lot more solid than it looked at the first time, but the pink ton is still there.

He could read every thought that passed through his wife's head as clearly as if she were speaking to him.

The next day when he took the train to work, his mind was a jumble of internal dialogues. One man was planning on divorcing his wife but was afraid it would be too difficult on the kids. A woman in her late-thirties was trying to decide if she should go back to school, and a toddler on his mother's lap was recreating a scene from the Magic School Bus. \n\nAt first, Mr. Soto's new ability seemed like a superpower.

We have been here ever since, drifting in and out of conversation, catching up on what we won\u2019t have time for. You tell me about your sister, your childhood pets, your favourite film. I tell you about a school trip to Wales. \n\nThe gale is still raging, shaking the scene below: trees are arching, a wheelie bin fits and starts, a vinyl banner slaps against brick. The window is closed and double glazed, giving us the impression that the world outside is on mute. A screen in the corner, you can not help but flick your eyes towards. The flicks become hovers and we watch the scenes in silence. The smaller birds are huddling, no doubt, sheltering out of view. But the larger birds - the gulls the magpies, the crows - are still flying. Or, at least, their wings are wide. They are tossed, buffeted, shunted. They are held for an instant, before dropping from sight, reappearing moments later when they are thrown back into our frame. It\u2019s getting darker, but the birds are bright. Shining in the bruised sky, search lights chasing out a home. \n\nThe birds became confused before we realised we were. Overshooting their destinations, or heading off in the wrong direction altogether.

She did not think of them as most people, hunters or innocent watchers alike, would. They were not fragile or cloddish in her religious perception. They were the freest creature that the Almighty has created. He, with his endless benevolence and love for creation, marked them as the ultimate example of free will bent and twisted to serve a higher purpose. They were, in her opinion, the perfect platonic extension of the Holy Ghost. The mere fact that most birds build their own nests with such weak elements \u2013 twigs and whatnot \u2013 and in the most unimaginably strategic ways was a full of vindication of God\u2019s presence within every denizen of the earth. Sister Azniv often thought of herself as a bird. She has been well over forty years in the service of God and the loyal bride of the Christ, though she did not particularly condone the entire concept of the latter. She understood very well the outline of her looks, and like many of her predecessors, she used her mien as a means of authority. There was nothing more assertive than a wise, wrinkly face clad in a nun\u2019s habit. And to accentuate this very point, Sister Azniv purses her lips behind her writing desk, suspicious of someone \u2013 an unwanted spirit, perhaps \u2013 scrutinizing her discreetly. She was no pigeon, of course, but a sharp-eyed eagle who detected sinners from a fifty-kilometer radius. \u201cThe devil smells like rotten cabbages,\u201d she\u2019d often whisper, then add: \u201cAnd I am yet to make a cabbage soup.\u201d She was right. This prophecy of hers was only confirmed when, on a certain night, Sister Azniv came to her bedroom only to find a hunched demon sitting at the end of her bed with a cabbage soup. \u201cWhat did I tell you about eating in bed?\u201d she said sternly. Later that evening, Sister Talar was found sprawled on the church terrace. Someone had pushed her, or she had pushed herself. Who knew? This event was later referred to as The Shooting Star Incident.

It was overwhelming. Alomst like ghosts appearing I could see the fights, laughter and misery. The walls was breathing it and the physical attributes like the smell and stains only reinforced the vibe.</p> <p>I was meeting a guy with a hat that would \u201cstand out\u201d, according to description. It was not hard to miss him since the bar only had 3 guests and a bartender. The guests was sitting as separated as they could in this big, dark and almost cold room. The stained wooden walls reached high and what might have been windows from the second floor covered the upper part of the walls. I walked straight to the guy with the hat. \u201cRight on time\u201d , he said. I silently sat down. We were both here for the same reason, to bring down the rebels. The hat guy came closer to me and whispered \u201cThey might be watching us from the windows above\u201d. Wow, he is paranoid I thought, but I answered with \u201cLet\u00b4s do this trade discretly then\u201d. I reached for his hand and with a handshake he had gotten what he wanted. Without hesitation he gave me what I was here for. A map leading to a hidden power source from before the war. I could not believe I was holding this map in my hands. If the stories was true, this power source could save the entire world. I politely said goodbye to the hat guy. \u201cBe careful. if that map ends up in the wrong hands it could lead to horrible destruction.\u201d He said. \u201cDon\u00b4t worry, our only option is to restore the balance that was lost in the war, and I will make sure this happens now when I possess the map.\u201d I replied.</p> <p>I walked out and started to contemplate what I just said.

There was always something that could get in the way. Work, fixing something at the house, volunteering at the dog shelter a few extra hours. It was raining, should he really risk getting a cold?\n\nFinally, on a fall day, he left his house in his Cutlass. He had explored a lot during the almost eight years he had lived here.

They drive a hard bargain. Today I offered $20 for a dozen acorns and Mr. Nibbles (the squirrel) looked right through me. He doesn\u2019t answer to his name but I\u2019m sure he would tell me if I were wrong about it. Some would say that I have everything in life, everything is never enough. This year I was featured on the cover of Time magazine as their person of the year but I went to the bottom of the sea and no one there had ever heard of me.</p><p>I hold the world record for the fastest ascent up the mountain of foregone conclusions.

No one actually thought to tell me how all of this works, they just put me here. I don't ever remember being an acorn myself. I must have been one once, but I only ever recall being this big. This... Infinite. \nSometimes I think that there would have been a mother tree, that I fell from. It must be beneficial to have a mother, I presume. Someone to talk to about things you're not clear on and tell you how you came to be. About your lineage and all that. Bards have sung my name for millennia, but in all songs I'm fully grown, with Midgard about my waist, all as is. \nIt's taken it out of me, I must confess, being around this long, and my thoughts are not as clear as they once were. It's often all... Muddling. Too many things have happened, I can't remember how they all go together anymore. \nMr Nibbles says I'm doing just fine, but I think he's been stealing my nuts. I don't trust him.\nIt was good, under the sea, where no one had heard of me. I got to pretend I was a large piece of Kelp. Had fun swaying about like I was a young sapling and the mermaids swam through my branches giggling. It tickled. It was very pleasant. \nDown there, the sound of Hel was muffled, which was a kind of relief. Thought the ocean might put out the fires, but they burnt just as bright. I don't like to look down.

He lived in a small cottage that was just a kitchen and one additional room, the house was painted red with white on the corners of the house and around the windows as is traditional in sweden. The house had no electricity and no running water and to be honest it wasn\u2019t really fit for living in, but Sven didn\u2019t care he had lived there for most of his life. He was an octogenarian by the time the sixties started and he had decided he would live out the end of his life in that cottage. He didn\u2019t live there by himself though. He had a housekeeper, a man that no one seemed to remember the name of. Looking at it with modern eyes it is safe to assume he was more than a housekeeper ,but while homosexuality wasn\u2019t a crime by the time the sixties began it was still considered a mental illness. What made Sven peculiar had very little to do with his supposed relationship with his housekeeper. It was said he could communicate with animals, he had apparently befriended a badger that had tunneled under his cottage and made its home under the floorboards. He was also a wise man and people said he could close wounds and heal the sick with various remedies. One morning a mother seeking help for her child\u2019s ear infection found him dead, he had apparently died in his sleep. The nameless housekeeper was nowhere to be found.

But there wasn\u2019t a room, there couldn\u2019t be, because the space she moved through seemed infinitely bigger than anything she had ever experienced. In fact, she wasn\u2019t sure she was flying either. She might be floating or swimming in an enormous pool of light water. She felt happy, and more energized than she could ever remember being. It was as if her own weight had been lifted, and she was merely a wind moving through a bright vastness free of resistance. Just as she was beginning to get accustomed to her new, carefree existence, something in the back of her mind, or somewhere in the cloudy distance, opened up. A hole of sorts. There were moving colors in the hole, and she could hear muffled sounds. Was it voices? She tried to steer away from it, she wasn\u2019t ready to leave. She was sure that going through the hole would not make anything easier. She even had the feeling that things might in fact get much, much worse. But the hole with the moving sounds and colors grew steadily bigger and she felt herself drawn closer. The hole was soon everything she saw, but she continued to resist. At last, a great jerk shot her out through the whole and into the bed at St Mary\u2019s hospital. [/quote]\n\n  \n\n### Response\n\nEverything was so bright, so loud. She did not like those new sensations. The peace she had felt a moment ago was now replaced by the chaos of people's excitement. As for the light, floating feeling, it was replaced by gravity. Her entire body felt like stone, and she could only move her tiny hands and feet. She was a strong girl but, as if all those changes were not enough, the great jerk slapped her bottom with his giant hand. Suddenly, her eyes started to burn, and a salted liquid blurred her vision more than the light itself; and her mouth opened wide, freeing a loud cry of confusion. The great jerk passed her to softer arms which landed her in even softer, warmer arms.

After Roger left a silence pervaded the country house, except for Martina\u2019s whimpering. She eventually crawled out and when Lena did not wake up Martina went to her grandmother who too did not respond and, uncertain what to do, she lay down beside her but then hastily got up as she didn\u2019t like the wet feel when her dress got blood-soaked. She stood up, pushed her hair out of her eyes, thereby wiping the blood on her face and platinum blond hair and wandered out onto the road. A neighbour saw her and asked \n\n \u201cWhere is Mama?\u201d\n\nWhimpering Martina pointed towards her house. Looking at the blood the woman breathed deeply.\n\n\u2018Come with me, sweetheart.\u2019\n\nFrom her home she dialed the police. \n\n## Prompted contribution\n\n### Prompt\n[quote=\"KaptenLongJonk, post:1, topic:225\"] <p>While entering the old bar I could feel the stuff that has been going on here. It was overwhelming. Alomst like ghosts appearing I could see the fights, laughter and misery. The walls was breathing it and the physical attributes like the smell and stains only reinforced the vibe.</p> <p>I was meeting a guy with a hat that would \u201cstand out\u201d, according to description. It was not hard to miss him since the bar only had 3 guests and a bartender. The guests was sitting as separated as they could in this big, dark and almost cold room. The stained wooden walls reached high and what might have been windows from the second floor covered the upper part of the walls. I walked straight to the guy with the hat. \u201cRight on time\u201d , he said. I silently sat down. We were both here for the same reason, to bring down the rebels. The hat guy came closer to me and whispered \u201cThey might be watching us from the windows above\u201d. Wow, he is paranoid I thought, but I answered with \u201cLet\u00b4s do this trade discretly then\u201d. I reached for his hand and with a handshake he had gotten what he wanted. Without hesitation he gave me what I was here for. A map leading to a hidden power source from before the war. I could not believe I was holding this map in my hands. If the stories was true, this power source could save the entire world. I politely said goodbye to the hat guy. \u201cBe careful. if that map ends up in the wrong hands it could lead to horrible destruction.\u201d He said. \u201cDon\u00b4t worry, our only option is to restore the balance that was lost in the war, and I will make sure this happens now when I possess the map.\u201d I replied.</p> <p>I walked out and started to contemplate what I just said. Did we really lose the balance, or was it the comfort of having unlimited power and food that created an illusion of balance? Since the rebels took down all the world governments there has been alot of misery but I belive this map is the beginning of a future filled with love and light.</p> [/quote]\n\n### Response\n\nHe put the much folded piece of paper in the inner pocket of his coat. He did not thank the man in the hat, or shake his hand when he stood up to leave, but simply nodded with serious eyes. \n\nHe came out of the dilapidated bar onto the dusty street of the dilapidated town. This had once been a flourishing gold mining town in one of the western states of America. No industry had been established and gradually the town went into a process of decay. He looked cautiously on either side of the street, and then walked hurriedly, wary and watchful, avoiding coming close to any passer-by. This was so that no wily pickpocket should nick the treasure he held close to his heart; and the pick pocket, unable to understand its value and finding it useless, toss it to the wind to be lost again forever. \n\nBut it was not lost now. It was with him \u2013 a map leading to a hidden power source that could save the world. He glanced around him as he walked, was watchful but there was rising elation and unfolding excitement in his heart. His step missed its rhythm as he walked and involuntarily incorporated a lilt, while in his mind he sang John Lennon\u2019s \u2018Imagine there\u2019s no countries\u2019.\n\nWhen he reached the old hotel he felt that the receptionist looked at him suspiciously. He took the room key, climbed the creaky wooden stairs to the upper floor, entered his room, and closed and locked the door. From the jug on the sideboard he poured himself a glass of water and drank it in a gulp to wet his parched throat. He drew down the window blind, took off his coat, and sat down at the table putting the small reading light on. \n\nHe breathed heavily. He was after all about to open a map that could lead to world peace and equality. His hands shook. Was he really about to unfold that elusive formula? What would that mean to him? Would he become powerful, rich; or perhaps most important be revered by posterity? He put the paper down and with shaking hands carefully opened the thick yellowed paper map which was in a process of separating at some of the folds. \n\nThe map lay before him. It was covered with a lot of hand written points all over it. His eyes focussed on the largest dot beside which was written \u2018YOU ARE HERE\u2019.

When she decided to study English literature, her perception of words and what can be made of them was drastically different than what they had eventually become. Four years of boundless supplies of logos turned Janine into a disbliever. Language failed her, and so did everything in consequence. The only times she enjoyed, genuinely enjoyed, literature were when the text's formula did not over-explain itself to her. \n\nJanine was on her way to the university when these thoughts crossed her mind rapidly, sparing her from creating any elision. This week was her last before she could finally tell herself, and the world, that she mastered herself. Her husband's death was pivotal for the decision she made that evening years ago when she considered her application. Before terminal illness took him away from her, Janine's husband had always been stuck on the idea that she was simply and very plainly intransigent, that she was incapable of \"unmolding herself\", as he used to say. And so, just to spite him, to spite his memory, Janine, the chafed widow, decided to get a degree in literature. What better way to distract herself, what better way to grieve Sam's absence, than to overcome the angular perception words had to offer? \n\nFour years had come to pass and Janine only once allowed words to overcome her being. It was a poem by an obscure poet they studied in World Poetry class: A Slow Mover by D.R. Werebear. The poem had the potency to summarize the vivid memory of the love of her life. She remembered bursting into silent tears as Professor Salem recited the poem out of memory with his powerful bass voice. \n\n[quote=\"disco4robot, post:1, topic:861\"]\nHow hard could this softness be? how soft was the hardest sea?\ni am a slow mover, a slug too be, but its alright, we\u2019re all just waiting through the night.\n[/quote]\n\nShe was a cliff being helplessly beaten by waves of arcane implications. Janine felt vulnerable, exposed. Thankfully, she was seated in the far corner of the classroom, desperately rummaging in her bag for a napkin to wipe her nose with. She sniffed loudly, and that was when Professor Salem rested his gaze on her. \n\n[quote=\"disco4robot, post:1, topic:861\"]\nSit tight.\n[/quote]\nHe commanded.\n\n[quote=\"disco4robot, post:1, topic:861\"]\nHow come the touch was real? I touched you in your neck and you got the chill. How fast could strangeness come? We hardened into one.\n[/quote]\n\n\"Sam,\" she whispered, the poem presenting itself to her as an endless imbrication of emotive recollections. It was music she had shut out of her heart, a kind of tune her heart had deafened itself to. \"Stubborn,\" she told herself. \n\nA hand lay on her neck; Sam was there, with her; no one could see him but her, and the poem.\n\n[quote=\"WereBear, post:2, topic:861\"]\nHow wide could this softness be? how hard was the softest tree?\ni am a fast twitcher, a slug to eat, but its okay, we\u2019re all just training ourselves to read\n[/quote]\n\nJanine smiled goofily, baring her teeth gently, as this memory drew attention to itself on her way to the university. What beauty, what wonder, that she could be all that was impuissant and fragile as she rolled the long film of remembrances: the curve of his lips, the bonhomie of his gait, his scent, and more. \n\n\"Ms Amarus!\" someone shouted from the distance.\n\nShe redirected her smile to the source.\n\n\"Ms Amarus!\" the voice repeated. \"Dogshit, Ms Amarus!

I cross my room and open the hallway that opens to an also empty living room, where the cat lying in the couch awaits me to feed her while I set up the kettle for the water. I turn on the few lights before I go back to my room, checking first through the library to see who has taken what, passing over the Portuguese and Swedish books, jumping through the Spanish and the Chinese. I then walk back my steps and hear that no one yet has started to write again. I put my head to someone\u2019s else door and listen what they are doing. In one I hear the sound of waves, in the other I hear praying and in the third the sound of a multitude. However, the are many rooms and I don\u2019t have time to listen to all. There is just a couple which I really like to visit from time to time. The one two doors to the left and the other three to the right. In the first, when I open, the sand from the room gets into the hallway and the smell of salt stings the face. In front there is only the sea and a man sitting against a tree looking at something in the beach while he has his notepad open over his legs. He is smiling. When I close, pushing the sand back, I go to the other room. When I open, I see a packed room with K-pop bursting in the back while teenagers laugh and plan their night drinking Soju. At the back, looking through the window, a woman with a computer takes a pause from writing. I close the door again, leave the noise locked out and return to my room. There I sit down, think of them and begin to write again. In the background, the orchestra has also again begun to play. \n\n## Prompted contribution\n\n### Prompt\n\n[quote=\"enlohim, post:1, topic:296\"] <p>The footsteps grew closer, soft but achingly slow.

I wanted to leave him there, but at the same time I couldn\u2019t forgive myself for letting anyone lost in the wood. The problem was the one that was guiding, the boy, was in reality the one that supposed to be lost.

He had never believed in those kinds of things. At least, that was what he always had been telling himself. But now he remembered. That day. So many years ago. \nIt was the stroke that made him remember. It wasn\u2019t even a real stroke. Nothing dangerous. He was fine. The doc called it a TIA, whatever that\u2019s supposed to mean. He was fine. Really. He felt exactly as he always had felt and everything was like it always had been. Except for that memory that now surfaced in his mind. \nit must have been close to sixty years ago; he was only a young boy at the time. A man, holding a small twig in his hands, was pacing back and forth on their yard. A bunch of men with shovels in their hands, were also there. The men were looking at the twigman who held the twig with outstretched arms like it was a grenade about to explode. After some strange strutting about he suddenly stopped, and with a triumphant look on his face, pointed at the ground and shouted: Dig here and you\u2019ll find your water! \nThe men picked up their shovels and got to work. While he was looking, the man came over, still with the twig in his hand. It didn\u2019t look like much. Just a twig. Seeing his curious eyes, the man said: Wanna try? He took it and the twig danced in his hands like it was alive. Whoa! yelled the man with a weird look on his face. -This is rare. Let me show you, take your thumbs and\u2026 Then, his father was there.  Ice in his eyes.  -You can leave now. Rage in his voice. -But, the boy\u2026 -NOW! Leave now, his father said, looking like he was about to hit the man.  The man left and that was it. He soon forgot about the whole incident. Hadn\u2019t thought about it once during all these years. Until the stroke, that is. But now he remembered it as vividly as it happened only ten minutes ago.\nThe doc forced him to stay at home for two weeks.  He was fine. Really.  But the doc insisted. Two weeks. Christ! He had been working seven days a week the last forty years. What was he going to do two whole weeks? he thought for himself sitting on the deck on his back yard. The deck was in great need of some care. It been ages since he oiled it. The fence was all crocked since it got hit by the plough last winter. It could use some paint as well. He looked around the yard and decided how to spend his forced vacation. He made a list of supplies and went in to town. \nIt was in the hardware store it happened. He had just picked up some nails for the deck and was heading for the paint when suddenly he felt a small jolt going through his spine. He was walking over a spot in the middle of the aisle and he felt something in the floor. Almost like electricity. He walked back and there it was again. He walked back again. And again. Every time he walked over the spot, he felt it. And then it disappeared again as soon he had passed the spot. It was a tile in the floor. It wasn\u2019t anything special about it. It looked like all the other tiles in the floor. He went down on his knees, tapping the tile with his finger. It seemed solid enough but the hairs on the top of his hand was standing up when he was touching the tile. Maybe if he used a screwdriver. -Can I help you sir? The clerk was standing right next to him, looking down at him with a raised eye brow. How long had he been there? -Yes. Yes, I need some oil for my deck, he blurted out, slightly embarrassed, while jumping up on his feet.\nOn the way back home, he was listening on the radio. It was Paul Peters quiz hour. His favourite. He got almost every question right as always. And he felt it again. He drove quite fast and a jolt hit him so sudden he almost lost control of the car. He let go of the gas and the car behind hanged on the horn.\nI am going crazy! he yelled, pressing the gas. \nIt was a lot of work cleaning the deck. It had been years since he last oiled it. While he worked his thoughts was raising. What was going on? He was sure he felt it. He didn\u2019t imagine things. He was sure about it. There was an energy emitting from that tile. And what the heck was that thing in the road?\nThe sun was about to set when he finished the deck. It was shining with oil. It didn\u2019t look new but much better than yesterday.  What am I going to do now? he was thinking to himself, putting the paintbrush in a plastic bag. And he realized he had decided that hours ago.  The traffic was intense, he had to park the car and walk the last bit.  Walking in the woods, on his way to the spot, there it was again. Stronger than the feeling in the hardware store. And it wasn\u2019t a spot. It was a line. Two black birds were sitting in a close by tree, looking intently at him. He got nervous. -Shoo! Scram, will you! The birds didn\u00b4t move at all, they just kept looking at him, almost like humans. He took a small stone from the ground but before he had thrown it, the birds took to the air. This is surreal he muttered to him self and started to follow the line going through the woods. The line was leading to the place in the road he had passed earlier in the day. While he was walking, he realized the feeling gradually got weaker. He was walking the wrong way. He turned around and walked deeper in to the woods. It was almost completely dark and he was cursing himself for not bringing the flashlight from the trunk of the car. But he didn\u2019t need sight anymore. The trail was easy to follow. He was like a train going along a rail.  After a couple of hours, he got a hunch and picked up a twig from the ground. It danced in his hands just like it had done so many years ago, pointing down towards the line like a compass. He entered the town in the morning. The line was much stronger now and he knew where it was going, the line was straight like a ruler and he had walked this way a thousand times. Up the hill on the road leading to his church. He started to run. Outside the church, two black birds were waiting for him. Two birds, or the same two birds? He cursed at them as he swung the church door open.  The line was leading straight to the altar and continued on the other side.  He circled the altar. There was another line crossing the one he had been following in a perfect 90-degree angle.  Two lines crossing and directly above it was the altar. He touched it and every hair on his body was tingling and dancing. He caressed it. Patted it with his hands while the energy was coursing through his body.  He knew now what he needed to do. There was something hidden here. Beneath the altar. And he needed tools. Big tools. And perhaps some explosives. Now, he knew. He needed to go back to the hardwarestore.", "created_at": "2020-01-25 15:03:50.445437", "updated_at": "2020-02-07 15:30:03.297861", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1338, "wiki": false, "reads": 25, "score": 25.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [455], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1042, "user_id": 250, "topic_id": 524, "post_number": 1, "raw": "## Unpromted contribution\n\nShe was a mere 18 year old girl with so much expected out of her, pregnancy was definitely none of it.

Wasps won't die, they can sting more, but it doesn't hurt that much. But both of them don't actually want to sting you. You just have to put cream on if you get stung and it's all OK.\"\n \nWe moved on to another topic, where invariably we try to impart something we know that will help them or make them better versions of ourselves (even though I still flap around like a deranged duck when a wasp enters my no fly zone). \n\nIn bed that evening, with the lights off, we lay together talking about the day, he quietly interrupted and asked \"Daddy?

She did not think of them as most people, hunters or innocent watchers alike, would. They were not fragile or cloddish in her religious perception. They were the freest creature that the Almighty has created. He, with his endless benevolence and love for creation, marked them as the ultimate example of free will bent and twisted to serve a higher purpose. They were, in her opinion, the perfect platonic extension of the Holy Ghost. The mere fact that most birds build their own nests with such weak elements \u2013 twigs and whatnot \u2013 and in the most unimaginably strategic ways was a full of vindication of God\u2019s presence within every denizen of the earth. Sister Azniv often thought of herself as a bird. She has been well over forty years in the service of God and the loyal bride of the Christ, though she did not particularly condone the entire concept of the latter. She understood very well the outline of her looks, and like many of her predecessors, she used her mien as a means of authority. There was nothing more assertive than a wise, wrinkly face clad in a nun\u2019s habit. And to accentuate this very point, Sister Azniv purses her lips behind her writing desk, suspicious of someone \u2013 an unwanted spirit, perhaps \u2013 scrutinizing her discreetly. She was no pigeon, of course, but a sharp-eyed eagle who detected sinners from a fifty-kilometer radius. \u201cThe devil smells like rotten cabbages,\u201d she\u2019d often whisper, then add: \u201cAnd I am yet to make a cabbage soup.\u201d She was right. This prophecy of hers was only confirmed when, on a certain night, Sister Azniv came to her bedroom only to find a hunched demon sitting at the end of her bed with a cabbage soup. \u201cWhat did I tell you about eating in bed?\u201d she said sternly. Later that evening, Sister Talar was found sprawled on the church terrace. Someone had pushed her, or she had pushed herself. Who knew? This event was later referred to as The Shooting Star Incident. The papers were cruel. [/quote]\n\n  \n\n### Response\n\nShe thought she was special. But not anymore. Sister Azniv was really confused. \"Perhaps Sister Talar was feeling herself as a bird too? Did all nuns feel as birds?\" Sister Talar was already with God. Well, maybe not. Who could know? \"God did not gave us wings for that particularly type of flying, if you know what I mean\". That was cruel. The gossip were mean. They looked like a bunch of thirteen-year-old teenagers. The notice fell down like a bomb at the church and its surroundings. \"The latter was a misunderstood\". \"We all saw Sister Talar wanted to tell us something. But we didn't listen. We are always afraid of everything.\" \"Leave me alone, she said and I close the door. I run down to ring the bell but it seemed that every single event was happening on purpose.\" \"It was garden time.\" \"I didn't have time to do anything. It's not my fault\". They all said. The judge did not seemed convince. Every single individual of the seminar was a potential suspect. The thing is that, at that time, no one even care about birds anymore.

Time slowed down as he saw how the bio knobs on her fingers flicked back from the neon pink trapeze. She descended into the black hole of the arena. As her reptile-enhanced body took up speed, his thoughts accelerated too. Will she survive? Was someone down there to help? Isn't it a strange beauty to her swirling body, the shimmering multi-colored fluorescent skin, the muscular winding tail, her red eyes wide awake in surprise and agony. Can chameos survive a fall from this height? Strangely enough, the dangers of this transhuman experience had never occurred to him. After all, the otherworldliness of the connex-ritual had been anticipated by the whole city for years. Accidents were unheard of to a point where they seemed unthinkable. But otherwise, what do we really know about them? His entangler reflexes kicked in: How would the reconciliation council respond? Which of the philosophies was best suited to facilitate the investigation team together? Suddenly, a membrane unfolded between her fingers and toes. This couldn\u2019t be enough to slow down her fall, or could it? Suddenly, Loco felt a rolling dizziness. He stumbled to the side and tilted into his neighbor, which hampered a fall. He mumbled an unintelligible apology and felt as if a mucous opening had been drilled into his brain. Anger, fear, astonishment, the floodgates had opened. Were these his emotions? Why? No, they're ours. But who is we? Still shaky, he looked around. The falling chameo artist had vanished into the dark bottom of the hall. Thousands of people held their breath, staring into the abyss.

This is not only because you either knew the deceased too well or not well enough at all. But also because there is inevitably a word limit. In this case, it was less than 2000 characters. The first pain the writer felt, already a sensation of being put upon, or weighed down, slipping into the skin around their eyes, was the restriction being given to them in characters. What does that mean in terms of words? Or chunks of text upon the page? Utterly without a clear frame of reference the notion of counting characters to read about the dead seemed reasonably, but the actual process of knowing character totals, in an interface, provided by the newspaper, that didn't offer a character count, was rude at best, and provocative at worst. As though one could marry writing freely with such mathematical precision. Then it dawned upon the writer, she should just channel whatever frustration this banality imposed upon her creative instincts into the obituary itself, and draw from this irrelevant impediment a lustful raging at mortality itself. To open with the phrase, atypical for drab obituaries, you cannot fit death into 2000 characters.\n\n## Prompted contribution\n\n### Prompt\n\n[quote=\"belaba, post:7, topic:57, full:true\"] <p>When he arrived in the bar I stood up to hug him.

She muttered something in broken English and I remembered I was the only native speaker of that language in this bar. She was proud she spoke it, but second, even third hand, and her pride had been swelled purely at the lack of comprehension the Iranians showed towards me. But I wished to tell, if I didn't need her to think me senile, they all understood me well. Better than she did. They would not acknowledge their proficiency in English, gleaned from their excellent underground educational system and pirated exposure to American television, because of fear of appearing pro-Western, and therefore suspicious in the eyes of any overly enthusiastic regime lackey. Anyway, her lack of sensitivity to detail, her inalert immediacy was a kind of pure attention that I had grown fond of, I will admit. She was present, if she was anything. She sat knocked the plastic garden table between us, nearly snapping its cheap flexing legs. Everyone turned to look. An old man, a young woman. Nothing really remarkable in that. She offered me a cigarette and I was regretful that was in equal measure interesting and dull. I realised it was my fault.

The air inside was cool and still, the only sound that of small hammers against silver, and the soft murmur of tourists marvelling at the skills of the smiths.</p> <p>Thaddeus had been waiting on a bench on the upper level for an hour. No tourists made their way here, kept out by a velvet rope across the staircase, and a small boy with a very serious demeanour. The letter from Solkov had allowed Thaddeus entrance.</p> <p>From inside the doorway in front of him, there was silence. The smith had stopped working. Thaddeus rose from the bench and met the woman in the doorway. The bowl she handed him was small and round, the surface smooth and soft.

At first it looked like a thriving desert landscape, but upon closer viewing it became apparent that most of what had seemed to my eyes at first as vegetation was in fact ruins almost completely ground down by what must have been thousands of years of erosion.\n\nMyths related to me spoke of a great city that once laid here, in a time before The Horrors, ancient events that are taboo to speak of amongst my people. Taboos that also prohibit the exploration of this plateau. \n\nI had little use for taboos in those days. They bored me. I thought myself above such superstitions. Now, as I'm older and wiser, I can see the wisdom in them. I speak to you now of these taboos because you will need to know these things soon enough. Be careful about whom you pass this knowledge to any further, for you may be met with incredulity or even hostility for doing so.\n\nA harsh dusty wind blew on my face as I turned it about to face a thing that I would never have expected.\n\nFrom a large hill upon the earth, an immense tower of stone rose at least a mile above the surface. It looked nothing like any building I had ever encountered before, nor like any natural thing. Trees and shrub were growing from cracks in the rock, the monolith seemingly indifferent to such minor aesthetic impurities. At the top, at the very edge of my vision, a glint of light. A window?\n\nAs I gazed slack-jawed at the view, I noticed going towards the foot of the tower a group of bipedal creatures. They walked with the gait of great apes and were covered in thick beige fur. As they reached the foot of the tower they immediately started climbing the great column. Their ascent bore little resemblance to how humans would climb. Seemingly bearing little regard for their own lives, they would leap and weave upwards on the stone, confident that they would find grip, and scrabbling for hand-holds as little stones would rain down from their effort.\n\nI knew in my heart that this citadel held the object of my quest. I would have to enter it to have it relinquish its secrets. Though I did not know why. Would I have to climb onto the backs of these brutes to get to the top? Or was there another way in?\n\nLooking about the base of the tower, there seemed to be an opening. A door, perhaps?\n\nI began my approach, and after an hour of walking and then half an hour climbing the hill, I got closer. I decided that avoiding the apes would be prudent, and snuck past some of their shelters at the base of the tower. \n\nBut when making my way around a large square stone, I came face to face with one. I froze. She had a large flat mouth on a big round head. Her beneath her fur, under short protruding horns her eyes looked big and black and without intelligence. Our eyes lock for a moment. And then she carries on building a makeshift shelter. Or nest. I pass on and come closer to the opening. It is wide and tall, big enough to hold this house that the chieftain before my had built. There are bigger houses in other tribes, though you have not yet seen them. And I assure you that this opening would hold all of them at once. \n\nI passed the threshold and made my way deep into the tower. I marveled at this place. Surely this was not a monument built by nature, but no human power I can conceive of could possibly match it. Though I rarely thought of the gods those days, at that moment they were close. Surely this place was wrought by the gods. What naivet\u00e9. \n\nAs great as my marvel was at the great corridor leading to the center, it was easily eclipsed by what awaited me at the center. In the gloomy (but existent?) light, I beheld the base of a great spiral staircase, large enough for twenty people to stand abreast on a step, and worn smooth by heavy traffic millenia ago. \n\nI began my ascent to the top.", "created_at": "2020-03-11 23:33:10.307916", "updated_at": "2020-03-11 23:33:10.307916", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 773, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 39.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [183, 454], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1339, "user_id": 380, "topic_id": 717, "post_number": 1, "raw": "## Unpromted contribution\n\nThe record skipped. \n\nIngrid put down her cold coffee and gently nudged her cat out of her lap.

That would have taken long enough to fix without the interruption of the kitchen light flickering above her. Then, after she'd sat back down on the couch, it was the window blowing open that made her disturb her cat's rest. Sealing it shut with a double layer of duct tape, she'd thought that would be the end of her troubles, but a drop of water had splashed into her coffee cup the moment she'd tried to take a sip of it.\n\nHad her neighbors left the tap running again? Or had they never stopped? The wet patch on the ceiling had become completely unsightly. \n\nShe had then pushed her couch back out of harm's way and finally taken a seat again. Her cat had happily jumped into her lap and the two had shared the ridiculous notion that that would be that for the evening, but then the record had decided to pose a problem.\n\nIngrid adjusted the gramophone's needle and figured she may as well reheat her coffee while she was up, not remembering that the microwave had been broken for months.

The hallway, whose doors could only be opened from the inside, the factory floor side (which kept the workers perpetually wary), contained no more than a coffee machine and tin, uncomfortable, but practical stairs, usually used by the workers to sit, flicking their cigarette ash earthworms into plastic coffee cups. The mornings were normally spent retelling their respective commutes; often it so happened that the ones living further away arrived sooner, which caused the ones living closer to gripe, blaming the poor infrastructure on the city government, claiming things such as not enough bridges and great need for widening the loop on the eastern city entrance, while those living further away, but arriving sooner, praised the practical solutions of the city\u2019s traffic experts. Those without cars living far away had it the worst; if they weren\u2019t clever, charming or resourceful enough to arrange transportation with a colleague living close by or a neighbor working in the same part of town, they had to be up at around 4. \n\n\n## Prompted contribution\n\n### Prompt\n\n[quote=\"Frivolella, post:1, topic:627\"] <p>She crossed the room diagonally and went to perch on the windowsill.

I don't remember exhaling. Together we flew through the entheogen portal navigating the interstitials of Indra's Net.\n\nIt was impossible to tell if we were shrinking or Indra's Net was expanding as its intertwined fibers took on a surreal glow in relief to the abysmal blackness before us. Side by side we tumbled into the darkness with glowing embers of Indra's Net disappearing from the edges of sight.\n\nIndra's Net receded behind us and an urban landscape materialized below us with thousands of tiny lights blinking in onyx structures. Immediately we were transported along a wide boulevard between soaring black obelisks.\n\nCrowds of machine dwarves lined our route and seemed to cheer us on but no sounds reached my ears. Distracted by the machine dwarves, I payed no attention to where we were going. Abruptly, we stopped moving & found ourselves prostrate upon an elevated dais.\n\nAn immense spider loomed over us & as its mandibles began to move I heard a voice in my head. \"I am Arachne & you have entered my lands.\" I burst into uncontrollable laughter & happened to glance at Reed. The pupils of her eyes were large disks & she was laughing harder than I was.\n\nAgain Arachne's voice filled my head, \"Know that I can destroy you on a whim.\" Reed & I both found this hilarious and redoubled our mirth. Arachne continued, \"But I am forbidden to leave this world and desire entertaining diversions. So I will permit you to survive on one condition.\"\n\nReed & I nodded in unison while betraying large shit-eating grins.\n\n\"You must go back to your world & lead interesting lives. I will call you here again & ask you for your stories.\" Arachne said. \"They better be good ones.\"", "created_at": "2019-12-29 06:59:59.250292", "updated_at": "2020-02-05 11:35:02.206343", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 766, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 27.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [647], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3940, "user_id": 354, "topic_id": 1245, "post_number": 3, "raw": "I is a me is a body is a we. \n\nOf your concerns with ownership, I would have you learn about \nthe state of affairs of the world\nso that you are not lost in space any longer\nand know where you are\n\nso that manic behaviour and narcissism \ncan be seen for what they are \nnot what the greeks said\nso last empire. \n\n trauma release required. \nor a burial, if you want that to be a mine. \nYou sweep at home?", "created_at": "2020-08-30 10:37:17.975820", "updated_at": "2020-08-30 10:37:17.975820", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 82, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 18.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [3937], "is_liked_by": [401], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1280, "user_id": 331, "topic_id": 666, "post_number": 1, "raw": "## Unpromted contribution\n\nI was raised in roofless houses of the holy.

My first breath was of air dusted and spiderwebbed with sawdust. My first faltering steps were taken to the rhythmic counterpoint of hammers beating crude nails into pine so fresh it still wept sap from its boles and knots. My father was always a resourceful man. When other people were out here panning for gold, fighting over land, settling, chasing out settlers, squabbling over anything they could find to squabble over, he rode in, with his rustic caravan of thriftily accrued supplies and, largely unnoticed, he did one thing: he built churches. I don't want you to get the wrong impression; he was not a religious man. Maybe in his own way, but not according to any certifiable standards. In fact, I might have been born in a butcher's shop, under a wooden slab dyed pink with bull's blood, the umbilical cord cut by the razor edge of a sterilised cleaver. Or in the wings of a makeshift country theatre, in the thin velvet-covered plywood of the trick box which my father used to slice my mother in half then reassemble her nightly during his brief time as a magician. Or, God forbid, in the ground floor of that miserable, crumpled tenement building, its walls thinner even than the magician's box, at least two dozen sweating, aching, shouting, restless souls between me and the distant, dimmed stars.

With its compact, sleek little black body and its bright yellow wink of beak. What\u2019s he doing there on the sill, staring in at me? Shouldn\u2019t he be out there in the shifting shadows, scavenging in a patch of streetlight, pecking worms from the tawdry hedgerows of this cheap back corner of suburbia? I reach to bang on the window with the end of my chewed brush handle, but stop myself. The brush is poised in mid air like a dart. The bird cocks his head, questioningly, but apart from that, shows no sign of being in any way perturbed by my presence. And I\u2026feel a kinship with him. My little turdus merula friend. Not with my girlfriend, who doesn\u2019t want me to have female friends (\u2018why do you need to have female friends?\u2019 she asks on a regular basis) despite my constant reassurance that my close female friends surely go towards showing that I have a healthy, non-discriminatory attitude towards women (well, don't they?).

Do we, individually, stop and think about what is our desired destination as a collective unit? In 50's and 60's enthusiasm about the future discoveries and technological progress was breaking all creative barriers - flying cars; illness-free human beings; space travel; eternal lifes even - not only in popular culture of U.S., but Soviet Union as well. There were, of course, few who did not see things so bright: the famous C.Sagan passage about resort to superstition and pseudoscience, or seminal works of A. Houxley and G. Orvel. Provided with the possibility of time to look back, we are given enough room to make an objective judgement on whose fiction or predictions were more accurate. And only partially - based on current psychological and neuro research - interpret on the reasons for \"why so?\".\n\n\nWithout being too pessimistic, one must recognise the breakthroughs achieved in science that allows us to live longer and to embark on interdisciplinary projects. However, all the innovations are rather simple: invention of penicilin, vaccines, and  milk pasteurisation reduced infant mortality and increased average living time dramatically. Internal combustion initially, then work specialisation and means of organising gaves us the ability to tackle more and more complex tasks. Full automatisation is a preferred end-game. All of this is supposedelly designed to unburrden humans from frivolous and soul crushing monotony of labor, so that capacity for creative dreaming would be freed. Yet, despite the benefits of Flynn Effect we, as a general collective, seem to be not appreciative of the latter capacity. It might be argued indeffinetely in a similar manner as to 'chicken and hen' question about who induces what (whether our nature induces the evolution of technology, or it is technology that  forms our habits).

A harsh wind blew on my face as I turned it about to face a thing that I would never have expected.\nFrom a depression in the earth, an immense tower of stone rose at least a mile above the surface. It looked nothing like the human edifices of steel and glass I was accustomed to from my urban childhood, save for the shape. Trees and shrub were growing from cracks in the rock, the monolith seemingly indifferent to such minor aesthetic impurities. At the top, at the very edge of my vision, a glint of light. A window?\nAs I gazed slack-jawed at the view, I noticed going towards the foot of the tower a group of bipedal creatures. They walked with the gait of great apes and were covered in thick beige fur. As they reached the foot of the tower they immediately started climbing the great column. Their ascent bore little resemblence to how humans would climb. Seemingly bearing little regard for their own lives, they would leap and weave upwards on the stone, confident that they would find grip, and scrabbling for hand-holds as little stones would rain down from their effort. \nI knew in my heart that I would have to enter this citadel to have it relinquish its secrets. Though I did not know why. How had I gotten here in the first place?\nWould I have to climb onto the backs of these brutes to get to the top?

I wanted to look him in the eyes, but the sun was hitting the mirror surface of his glasses and all I could see was my own gaze, desperately grasping for contact. I had been looking for so long, I had been looking for so long for this, for this very second in time and this very encounter for so long. Sitting there, with the lemonade singing in the wind, it felt ridiculous.

I wanted to tell him that every moment is the beginning for all others, that this was just one of those. A drop in the ocean of time. To ask him whether he said that to all the girls. Instead I kept silent. I didn't want to say the wrong thing. I became acutely aware of the clothes on my skin, the position and shape of my hands as they wrapped around the glass. \n\nI took a sip from the lemonade. It was cheap. Probably from concentrate. Cheap stuff bought in bulk from a big distributor, produced in nameless factories by nameless people I would never meet. In the clarity and awareness of that moment I could perceive my mind going down a rabbit hole of connections and immaterial consequences, all trying to distract myself from the intensity of this strange and yet all-so-familiar feeling that I knew Ralph from a different life, a different existence so far removed from this one that it must have been someone else entirely.\n\n\"I'm packed and ready.\" I finally say.

He could not understand nor grasp how Goldie Locks, the woman he fell madly in love with a decade ago, the very woman who harpened on having a family -- \"creating\" was the verb she would often use -- that very person was now, more than ever, irrevocably against the notion of a child. \n\nRump knew it wasn't just the sex.

Well, they grew grim, for lack of a better word. And Rump, maddened by the inexplicable ludicrousness of Goldie's constant rejection, finally decided to break his own rule: *Never solicit deals for personal ends.* One night, after making sure that Goldie was fast asleep, he snapped his fingers and teleported himself to a place he never thought he would visit again: Egypt. \n\nIt was not the country he once knew in his youth; Egypt had turned into a modern city under an unforgiving sun.

If we were to start dying from lung cancer by age 50, I would be surprised. It's been eight long years since they started burning garbage around my community, a dirty, urban ghetto far away from the pristine middle-class communities so that they won't choke on the very air they breathe. They won't because we do it for them. Ever since the fires started, they haven't stopped. They do seem to burn heavier in the mornings, though.\n\n\"Mavis?\" I hear my mother call.

The smoke affects her more than it does me, which is why she needs the wet cloth.\n\n\"Yes, mummy?\"\n\n\"You need to leave,\" she tells me. She doesn't like it when I loiter here before going to school, or when I come home early. She wants me to spend as little time here as possible, despite it being my home. She wants me to breathe the dirty air as little as possible.\n\n\"I'm going to leave soon, mummy,\" I promise her, and she sighs. She moves the cloth from her face briefly, and she still looks like she's in her thirties, despite being all of 45 years old. She has the most beautiful smile, and she tries her best to be optimistic. You would never have known that the lives here if you worked with her.\n\n\"Alright,\" she says, before kissing the top of my head, and then putting the cloth back in place. With my backpack already in place on my back, I stare in wonder at the dim-lit sky. It seems to almost invite a sense of melancholy to those who live under it.

I first met Victor one blustery, miserable morning in early 2020. I was running to tutor a child on one of the most expensive streets in London which is, in turn, one of the most expensive streets in the entire world. It was the day after the election, and tears were never far from my eyes. The pavement was sticky and wet. Summer and hope seemed a thousand years away. As I turned the corner, I saw a man in a red jacket, holding out a copy of the Big Issue in a thin plastic folder. He had a thick dark beard and curly black hair. His left leg was shaking slightly. As I passed him, our eyes met. \"I'll be back!\" I shouted. In the lesson, my student Danielle and I looked at the sonnet by Shakespeare in which the poet compares his lover to a summer's day. He concludes that, whereas summer is fleeting, his lover is eternal, because his lover will live on in the printed lines of the poem: \"So long as men can breathe or eyes can see, So long lives this and this gives life to thee\". After our two hours were up, I left the house and turned the corner. Almost immediately, the man selling the Big Issue caught my eye. We pointed at each other exaggeratedly as I moved towards him. I bought a copy and we shook hands. \"I'm Victor,\" he said. Victor was originally from Pakistan, but had lived in Italy since he was 12 and had an Italian accent. He had been working on the floor of a Fiat factory just outside of Milan when a hereditary spinal disorder from his father's side had started to manifest, causing him pain and restricting his movement. He was forced to stop working at the factory. Some friends had told him that he would stand a better chance of getting the necessary healthcare in the UK, so he had come to London. I guessed we were about the same age. We shook hands again and said goodbye. It's February now. This story's for you, Victor. It's not much, but I won't forget you.

I press the bridge of my nose.<br> It was a mess, a horrible mess of ink and paint.

Shouldn't he be out there in the shifting shadows, scavenging in a patch of streetlight, pecking worms from the tawdry hedgerows of this cheap corner of suburbia? I reach to bang on the window with the end of my brush handle, but stop myself for a moment, the brush poised in mid air like a dart. He cocks his head, questioningly, but apart from that, shows no sign of being in any way bothered by my presence. And I...feel a kinship with him. My little turdus merula friend. Not with my girlfriend, who doesn't want me to have female friends ('why do you need to have female friends?' she asks on a regular basis) despite my constant reassurance that my female friends only go to show that I have a healthy, non-discriminatory attitude towards women (well, doesn't it?). Not with Brian, whose bonhomie as a fellow artist I suspect thinly masks a need to constantly be better (sell more, paint more, know more) than me. Not with my dad, who has moved out into the solitary depths of the countryside, bought himself a French bulldog and become proportionately more lonely and eccentric as a result. Not with the other artists at the college reunion last week who, despite the fact that I'm supposed to be 'one of them', leave me feeling like a perennial outsider, a weirdo, an (say it) Impostor. No. Not with any of them. But with this blackbird, my little scavenger, I feel a...fellow feeling.

By being to good at it. The kids in my class started to enjoy coming to school and they started being happy.... Now, that's dangerous! \nApparently, being knowledgeable, kind, having good relations and the trust of your students and their parents, making the kids enjoy their time in school, all these things are not what this society wants from teachers.\nNo. It's very clear to me, after working as a teacher for well over a decade now, that the purpose of school is not to educate children. Or to make children trust adults. Nor is it the purpose to make the children feel good about themselves and grow with their accomplishments.\nForget all about that. \nThe school, as an institution has become more and more oppresive and rigid, at least in Sweden where I come from. It's all about obeying the rules and being on time. For both teachers and students. Very little about actually learning things. Or forming human bonds. Or having fun! \nOne might wonder, what kind if adults these children will become after years in school, feeling like failures, and constantly being let down by adults. \nMost kids of today- lets face it, don't get the attention from their parents at home. Parents are busy, surviving. The little time parents get off, they are exhausted and simply don't have the energy to actually interact with their own children. We all know this, just hand them a phone, and you as a parent can continue the tasks of the day without too much interruption. Cause you - as a parent- you race against time every day. In only 24 hours you need to take care of the family, your job, your house, you need to go to the gym, you need to post on social media how happy you are and so on. You don't have time as a parent to give your attention to your child. \nNow, in school, teachers don't have time to give their attention to children either. We have paperwork to do, and deadlines to keep. \nIf teachers DO listen and actually DO interact with the cildren they teach is something really special. Children turn to each other for support and help to solve their problems. This in my opinion leads to all kinds of bullying because this is how emotionally immature individuals solve their problems. We are creating a parallel universe for our children, a \"lord of the flies\" reality. And ultimately I can't stop wondering if this is the purpose of the school system as a whole. Getting fired for doing what I thought was my job, made this very clear to me. School is about teaching our kids to obey whoever is strongest at the moment. Is that really the future we want for them? \n\n## Prompted contribution\n\n### Prompt\n\n[quote=\"Zambor, post:1, topic:313\"] <p>\u201cA People\u2019s tribune,\u201d she corrected, pointing with the barrel of her revolver to the frayed golden braid looped through her epaulette.</p>  <p>A cop\u2019s cop.

The icy look in her blue eyes didn't leave that much to discuss. I've seen that look in her face before. She was dead serious. My mind was racing. What was she up to? Somehow I needed to buy time, or distract her. For a brief moment a was hoping that the explosions in the building and the destruction on the street and all around us would distract her. But... Who was I kidding. Out of all the people in the world I had to get arrested by Reed. The one woman in the entire world, with a heart colder than her icy blue eyes. Nothing could scare this woman... Not even the end of the world would affect her, in any way....I'm sure she would just keep on going. \nIt was getting increasingly difficult to breath in the room, from all the dust from the collapsing ceiling.

So this was the \"people's tribune\" she meant? A bunch of blood thirsty, wild kids with kalasnikovs in their hands? I had not had much hope for justice in the first place, but this? Really?\nMy heart was pounding in my chest, the adrenaline made me dizzy, my knees started shaking. As I slowly made it down the dimly lit staircase, with Reed and her revolver pointed at the back if my head behind me, I realised I had to take my chances. I could not be left to the mercy of the army of the orphans.... Five stairs to go then we would be outside on the street. Four, three, two...one! I took a step backwards as fast as I could and I slammed my body as hard as I could putting all my weight behind it, trapping Reed towards the wall.

She Enrolled As A Student At Manhattan College Of Music. It Was Summertime, & Sister & I Were On School Break, When Our Parents Decided To Drive Us To & Stay At A Rural Family Farmhouse In Upstate New York For A Few Days! It Was A Big Deal & Meant To Be An Educational Experience Of Farm Life For We Inner City Folks & We Kids Were So Excited To Drive There. After We Settled Into Our Rooms, We Kids Were Given A Tour Of The Barn By The Farmer Kids,  To See The Animals, Baby Rabbits In Their Hutch, Sleeping In The Nest Mama Rabbit Made & Lined With Her Soft Hair To  Keep The Little Hairless Babies Warm, Chickens Were Scratching Through The Hay Strewn On The Barn Floor For Grain,  & Cows Lined Up In Columns On Either Side Of The Barn Door Feeding As They Waited To Be Milked. I Froze Transfixed For A Few Minutes & Lost Track Of The Other Kids Upon Seeing One Raise Its Tail To Watch A Calf Be Born! The Amniotic Sack Burst & Water Spewed Out Of Her, As Her Calf's Head & Forelegs Appeared.  The Farmer's Kids Found Us, Me & The Cow & Calf, & Assisted In The Birthing Process, Baby All Gooey & Wet. Later On, We Would Return To The Farmhouse To Wash Up & Partake Of A Meal Of Fried Chicken, Mashed Potatos & Corn On The Cob For Supper & Served Family Style!  Strawberry Shortcake Was Offered For Dessert.  We Had A Choice Of Tea, Coffee Or Lemonade For Beverage. We Chatted With The Other Guests, Young & Old, Two Other Families & About 12 Of Us Altogether. Then I Remember The Elders Deciding We Would Take A Walk Up The Hill Behind The Farm House, In The Clammy Dusky Twilight. The Group Ascended The Hill Beyond The Gate. The Scent Of Hay & Mud & Cow Mixed & Wafted Into My Nostrils. The In Between Becomes Fuzzy. I 'd Slipped & Fallen Into A Cow Flop, So I Needed Return To The Farmhouse To Change Clothes.  The Group Descended The Hill. It Was Dark By The Time We Reached The House, & I Was A Tad Embarassed Since Everybody In The Group Had A Liitle Laugh At My Expense. I Took A Shower & Put My PJ's On & Got Into Bed. However, Sometime In The Middle Of The Night, I Developed A High Fever. Mom & Dad Were A Little Concerned Since I Also Had Been Throwing Up!  They Decided It Would Be Best If We Returned Home In The Middle Of The Night. Dad Got In The Driver's Seat & Sister Was In The Front Passenger Seat. Mom Decided To Sit In The Back With Me As I Laid My Head On Her Lap. I Remember Looking Up Through The Window To See Stars Twinkling In A Clear Night Sky... When Two Little E.T.'s Hung Their Head From The Car Roof & Peered Down At Me...I Remember Nothing Else About That Night Or The Ride Home, How Long It Took, When We Arrived Home & Neither Did The Rest Of The Famil.

As Barry bounced from one residence to another, either spending just one evening or temporarily living with this person or that person, he would often spend nights there in Ronda\u2019s basement.  Calvin\u2019s cousins lived close by, so they were frequently there while their parents were all at work. It was counted on that any combination of no less than of five of Calvin\u2019s cousins of all ages, along with maybe an aunt here or an uncle there, would be at the house at any given time and this included spending nights there, which Calvin sometimes did as well whenever Barry would stay.  However, Barry was not always actually present whenever Calvin would spend the night, as Calvin would occupy himself by playing video games, many times well into the early morning.\n\tCalvin was an extremely shy, but cute nine-year-old.  Kids often made fun of what he wore because it was not only never in style, but it was always tight-fitting, thanks to Barry. Barry believed that only wannabe thugs and hoodlums wore baggy clothes, so at least in his presence, Calvin wore clothes that looked more suitable for someone a few years younger than him and several inches shorter.  Calvin had no desire to dress as his father described, but he also did his best to not look as if smothered as he wore the clothing Barry would pick out for him. \n\n\n## Prompted contribution\n\n### Prompt\n\n[quote=\"Victoria, post:1, topic:656\"] <p>Surprisingly that need could be satisfied by the opposing forces of my hotel room\u2019s scrappy ac and the static ping that the little tube screen on the corner made as I waited for the room service.</p><p>There is something comforting about those non defined generic spaces and the interaction with the objects inside, that gray corridor that leads to the elevator, the Macy\u2019s bought Miami inspired lithography, I used to need it so bad that I ended up owning it, the airport lounge became my reading station, that tiny office room with a fax machine, became my spa.

Politics through and through. \nLeaving was smooth, from my point of view. I was travelling alone with two small children.  It is an unforgiving sport with no prize (unless you count the gin and tonic the air hostess gave me while the smaller one slept, she sensed my relief to only focus on one and offered a different kind of solace that went gratefully received, she suggested I might like a bottle of wine with my dinner, I'm not a drinker really but I accepted, a tin can for ten hours with two small people? I might well need help of that kind). \nBut.\nWe made it. The three of us. The plane was full. It was the penultimate flight, for that airline, out of that city. A huge relief that we made it. And then utter disbelief people on the flight would sit there and wear their masks and disinfect their table trays but then try to get my toddler to high five them or steal a kiss from their cheek. First of all STRANGER get the fuck off my child you weirdo and secondly you clearly got the memo about the virus SO WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO TOUCH A CHILD.....my child. Not your child. STRANGER. And my thoughts cycle in this confused loop, unable to escape from the sheer stupidity of these people and completely dumbfounded by the (almost) never-ending ability of people to think it is OK to touch a child they don't know. Bad enough people wanting to smear their hands over your baby bump before these bundles arrive. I sound like a skeptic, I'm not, this stuff just cooks my goose way beyond dry and I mean that in a bad-Christmas-dinner sense, not a self-indulgent-session-exhausted kind of a way. It's just so perverted.\nBut.\nWe made it.\nI sit here alone. But I am not really alone. I am never alone anymore. Everywhere I go I am followed by two small fireballs of energy. They are the constant that now defines me. I get the time at the end of the day *if* I have any energy left by that time. Since we landed here the weather has hit us like water gun to the chest. A police water gun. And this country is in some kind of mire. But, it is home! And I can handle shit at home, on my own turf, in a way I could not in the tropics. \nWe are \"self isolating\" for seven days. Seven days. We have made it to day six. We are symptom free so far. This country is struggling and yet I have come here. Even my cousin has it. She is stuck in the capital in a tiny flat with a two year old. The two year old has had it too. They cannot come to where I am to escape. Her parents are strong and fit but there are underlying lung conditions. It could be dangerous. Too dangerous. It has ripped families apart.\nIt has stripped a layer off ours as I have left my partner back where we were. I miss them keenly, even if we haven't been communicating well for sometime. It still isn't the (current) aim of the game to be a single parent situation. But the virus has forced my hand. \n\nFor now we need to finish day seven of self isolation to move on in the game. \n\nNone of us quite know where the game will take us next. \n\nIt is a new game and we are all trying to understand the rules. \n\nIt is not a virtual game, although it feels as though it is being played out in an alternate reality.\n\nIt is not a nice game and I don't recall being asked to play.

He lived in a small cottage that was just a kitchen and one additional room, the house was painted red with white on the corners of the house and around the windows as is traditional in sweden. The house had no electricity and no running water and to be honest it wasn\u2019t really fit for living in, but Sven didn\u2019t care he had lived there for most of his life. He was an octogenarian by the time the sixties started and he had decided he would live out the end of his life in that cottage. He didn\u2019t live there by himself though. He had a housekeeper, a man that no one seemed to remember the name of. Looking at it with modern eyes it is safe to assume he was more than a housekeeper ,but while homosexuality wasn\u2019t a crime by the time the sixties began it was still considered a mental illness. What made Sven peculiar had very little to do with his supposed relationship with his housekeeper. It was said he could communicate with animals, he had apparently befriended a badger that had tunneled under his cottage and made its home under the floorboards. He was also a wise man and people said he could close wounds and heal the sick with various remedies.

Helen got rid of Sven's belonging, and kept only one thing: the diamond Sven stole from his american girlfriend when he was younger.

He got up in haste, and realized that the race was soon about to start. Billy's apartment was a mess. It had been clean just a couple of days ago, when he had let Tom in. Tom knew he was putting his friend through a lot of trouble. >>For what reason? That I couldn't differentiate between what's mine and what's not?<<\n   They had found out that he had been stealing from the office, and his lies couldn't help him.

He smelled like an old carpet, and Tom cursed the fact that there were so many people like him around.

He was buried without any people present, and his little cottage was taken by the county to take care of. They sent out their people to do a valuation of the house. Two men with fancy suitcases went out, but was shocked to find  that the cottage had been barricaded by a giant badger. The next day, the county sent their local hunter, Mr. Goberfolds, to deal with the problem.\n   \"No badger has ever been too tough for me\", said Mr. Goberfolds. He approached the cottage slowly, for he was wise enough to know never to underestimate an opponent. He cocked his shotgun and aimed at the small cottage window.\n   \"Come out, Mr. Badger!\" he shouted. \"I will spare your badger blood if you surrender now.\"\n   But all remained silent. Mr. Goberfold sighed and got up. \"Well\", he shouted, \"you brought this upon yourself.\" He took one step closer to the cottage, when the ground disappeared under his feet. He fell through a canny hole in the ground and dropped his shotgun. First he couldn't understand what had happened. He was sitting in a gigantic tunnel system. When his eyes started to adapt to the darkness, we found that he wasn't alone. A small man, not much bigger than the broom he was holding, was cleaning the tunnel.\n   \"What kind of devil's game is this?\", shouted Mr. Goberfold. But the man with the broom didn't answer. He just kept on cleaning the tunnel as if nothing had happened. Mr. Goberfold decided to get up, but was paralyzed by fear when he heard a low grumble from the end of the tunnel. Soon, from out of the darkness, a beast with bare pointy teeth and red, shining eyes appeared.\n   \"Bless my children\", was Mr. Goberfold's last words, before the giant badger threw itself over him.", "created_at": "2020-01-19 14:38:39.269385", "updated_at": "2020-02-06 13:13:23.407872", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1005, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 2.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [661], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1349, "user_id": 389, "topic_id": 727, "post_number": 1, "raw": "## Unpromted contribution\n\nA love letter to Itch: \n\nI\u2019m writing this on a chalkboard in hopes that you might hear this message, since we are currently on a break from feeling any messages.

It was a faintingly sunny first day of school. I was looking around, with the sun\u2019s aftershade still in my eye, wondering what all these kids around were thinking and what is to happen in the new environment. Soon I lost in a long gaze at a pencil whirling on the fingers of one of my classmates, missing my primary school friends whom I used to dance with. A slip of the hand, the pencil fell and rolled to the door. Just as I was waken from my daydream, a tall gentleman appeared, picked up the pencil, came in front of the class and greeted us with his strong tenor voice, \u201cGood morning, class!\u201d \n\nEach of the sounds solemn, steady and confident. The gentleman kept a straight face, with his moustache well-groomed, clothing ironed to allow only the slightest trace of wrinkle. An authoritative father figure came to my mind. But as he returned the pencil to my classmate and started introducing himself, he transited into a lively tone, I eased my neck and take a breath of relief. After all these years, he turned out to be the most humorous teacher in my life, and a closest friend of mine. He had always helped troubled students like me, troubled as he once was.

Alain flicked on the electric light and looked around. The portal had deposited him in some bizarre situations before, but this was the first time that he ended up in complete darkness.\nHe was in a room without any illumination. The air smelt stale as if the area had been enclosed for years. He tapped the light, and the beam stopped flickering. He'd have to get it checked out when he got back to HQ.\nAs soon as the beam of light washed over the far wall, he heard a skittering - like the movement of some animal that didn't truly lift their feet off the ground. It sounded like the shifting of a snake on a carpet of dead leaves.\nQuickly, Alain tried to focus the beam of light on the thing, but it seemed as though the moving object was always one step ahead of him. Suddenly, the slithering sound stopped. \n\"How nice, a visitor,\" a voice said from his right ear.\nAlain spun the light about to focus on the face next to him, bringing his sidearm up immediately. Within the yellow orb of light, a face emerged from the blackness around it, completely pale, with impossibly red lips. It smiled at him, so widely that the top half of the face almost detached from the bottom. Without thinking about it, Alain fired at the thing, emptying seven rounds into the being.\nBreathing heavily now, he flashed the light onto the floor, looking for the body he expected to be there. The ground was bare. There was no sign of anything. Heart racing, Alain consulted the watch on his wrist. He would be here for forty-five minutes more, according to the portal timer. \nThe last thing he heard was the voice again, this time from his left, whispering, \"This is why we hate visitors.\"\nHQ never heard from him again.\n\n## Prompted contribution\n\n### Prompt\n\n[quote=\"ArtisticRising, post:1, topic:344\"] <p>The sunlight felt inappropriate in the wake of the horrors of her reality.

The wall was what had intrigued him so much that he had accepted to become a caregiver for Mr. van den berg. It was an oddity, for the entire wall was covered with frames of all sizes and kinds: ornate frames, thin frames, rustic frames, silver frames, frames with inner bezel \u2013 all put up in an elaborate jigsaw, a collage of craftsmanship and decor. What struck as odd was not the motley of frames strewn aesthetically across the wall's fading wallpaper but that all of them contained no photographs or drawings: they were starkly empty. Like barren spaces bereft of any color or life, as if the very memories they had held had faded away, just like the memory of the occupant of the house.

Is everything alright?\u201d\nThe old man stopped in his tracks, feebly turning around to face the person who had called out to him. For a moment he did not respond. \u201cErik?

He held it out to the woman. \u201cI am certain.\u201d</p>  <p>The old man on the floor hide a smile as he turned away.

Thaddeus was an inquisitive soul and always ready to explore any intriguing nook or cranny that would catch his attention. And in a new city, those would be far too numerous to count. So even though he had set out a few hours prior to buy ingredients for dinner, Marius had not thought anything of it.\nBut as the light was failing, so too was his calm. At his perch in the kitchen where he had been skinning potatoes, he strained his ears to hear the telltale creak of the main door, or the flip flop of Thaddeus' sandals across the courtyard floor. He would have even welcomed the overpowering smell of attar wafting through the kitchen, a telltale sign of Thaddeus' having entered the room. And as usual Thaddeus had left his cellphone at home, a discovery he made when attempting to reach him and instead hearing his ringtone echoing in the courtyard. \nWith the orange hue of the sunset replaced by the orange hue of the street lamps, Marius stepped out in searching for him. He briskly walked towards the souk and in broken Arabic, and mime, asked the shopkeepers of Thaddeus' whereabouts. They all had pointed in the same direction. Marius briskly walked through the narrow streets, weaving through the evening traffic of pedestrians and motorbikes making their way home. At one point he almost tripped over a heap of clothes which turned out to be an old man hunched over on the ground. With a cursory glance Marius hurled a quick sorry while continuing to walk on. A woman with wares placed before her was sitting besides the old man. She looked at Marius and raised a copper bowl towards him. But he had already passed her by.\n'Some people are always in a hurry,' she muttered out loud. The old man nodded in earnest. \n'If only he stopped to notice.

When I awoke this morning all was silent. The news had an unusual report: No birds had been singing this morning. It was the same all over the world; they all seemed to have vanished. Soon the reports started coming in, the ornitologists had been rushing out, tears in their eyes, and found their wards fast asleep in their nests. Nothing could wake them. I went to work quite bewildered. People were making jokes, nobody really understood what was going on. All the fishes were on the aquarium floor. If they were dead they'd have floated. They were sleeping. The receptionist shrugged her shoulders.  The tension was palpable. The rest of the day I tried to work as usual, but my thoughts were elsewhere. A television set was on somewhere, they reported that russian scientists had figured out that all this had something to do with the skeletons, birds have hollow skeletons, fishes have soft bones, somehow that makes them susceptible to minute changes in the environment. They were talking of placing them in special controlled pressure chambers, and hoped to somehow wake them. I didn't quite understand, and I wondered how they'd be able to build chambers for all the birds and fishes of the world. I left work early, I wasn't the only one. When I came home I found my daughter staring at the laptop. The reports had just come in that reptiles and small mammals were falling asleep. She was worrying about the dog.

It seemed as if the light from the fire only made a mockery of lighting her, and it made her stand out from the dark night not by being lit, but by her absolute resistance of light. She was a black hole in darkness, and, always cold, she had lit a fire to attempt to once, for a moment, feel as if there was warm blood in her veins.\n\nThere was like a surge in the air, there wasn't a sound calling her but a need. A connection that was lost but never fully severed called from somewhere far away, but still so much closer than before. It was a bitter voice, full of resentment and grief from rejection, but resonating with need, with longing, with scorned love. And it was this that echoed in her, a reach for love and a longing for a lost half. She reared her head towards the call, and she got up on her paws. She knew now what she was. all those years of wondering, all that time of aimlessly roaming and trying to make sense of her existance came to this point, cleared like fog in the rising sun.\nShe started to make her way through the dark, leaving the fire behind her. As she ran, she transformed into the shapes that she had worn in her previous, forgotten lives, from the bear shape she was so used to to the riders, the fighters, the castouts, the downtrodden. All of the people who have lost their darkness, who have severed their shadow, all those who have sought to be only light and in the process become only resentment and hate.

In the comics, there is always this one weakness the hero holds, the cryptonite that will be able to kill the undefeatable, the achilles verse, the leaf on Siegfrieds shoulder, so that the dragon blood does not cover his whole body, making him vulnerable on this one spot. \n\nWhat was my weakness, I always wondered. Not that I though, that I was perfect, but I was aware that the biggest weaknesses are mostly laying in a blind spot, hiden. Like the leaf on his shoulder. What was my trigger point, to make me snap, or suffer or feel isloated. I did not know. I was so innocent. At some point I was smart enough to focus on my strenght: manipulating pictures. A really interesting thing to do is to invert your strenght. \n\nIf I am good at manipulating pictures, maybe I am also good at detecting manipulation on pictures, I thought. I mean, I could see the crappy photoshop fails on ads in the subway in a second. I could criticize every movie poster, every bad instagram fake. Once I turned it arround, it was a lot of fun in the beginning to expose the manipulation to people who had no idea about it. Soon it became an addiction. I never thought, that it could be of any use, or that there was any way that this skill could help in any way to make the world a better place, except from the wonder or laughter I was getting in return from my friends or people at a bar, when I showed them the two right hands a person at a poster had. \n\nOne day on the internet I stumbled on a forum about modern and digital ways of propaganda and warfare. People shared different kind of media, discussing the credibility and the possibility for deflection and misinformation. I was shocked and excited at the same time. How could that exist without me ever hearing about it. I never was into war or playing with weapons as a child. In history class it was always clear to me that the context of war was a maschine designed to give birth to the evil of the human soul. But here it was. The aspect of war that fascinated me. To justify cruel, inhumane actions, to keep up a false narrative to trick the opponent, to false flag an attack, to reverse an opponents story, all of this had to do with the manipulation of media. With the fabrication of evidence. And here I was. With my superpower to debunk fake footage. It was easy for me to learn the methods and tools to analyse not just pictures but also movie-clips and to verify sources and credibility of material. \n\nSoon I became a fighter. A fighter for truth in the depth of the web. Unknown by any of my friends, unknown of the public, I found the one thing to make the world a better place, with the super power I held.

When the men started digging the man had let him hold the twig that danced in his hands like someone was pulling at it. He had totally forgotten about that incident. Until the stroke.

Like an invisible train rail. At first, he followed it in the wrong direction. The sensation got weaker and weaker as he walked. But now he was walking in the right direction. The feeling was almost electric. The line turned towards the town. It led up the hill to the church he had been working in the last 40 years. Two black birds were sitting outside, looking at him almost like humans. He got uneasy. -Shoo! He yelled at them as he swung the church door open. Inside the sensation was much stronger. The line went straight to the altar. When he walked around it, he discovered that another line was coming at a 90-degree angle. Two lines crossing just under the altar. He touched it and every hair on his body was dancing. He caressed it, the power running through his body. And he knew, there was something under the altar. He needed tools.

In a week, she stored more than a hundred Tupperware in her modest kitchen, and to Cem's surprise, she even started to work as a sales rep, assuming a 10% profit on net receipts. With the money, she'd buy meats of her own and fill her Tupperware with them. She was happy. \nOne night, after another successful Tupperware sale, Meryem treat herself with a delicious piece of raw steak and headed home to cook. Opened the door with an annoying rattle, and moved forward, to the living room. There he was, her husband Cem, swinging at the end of a rope tied to the antique chandelier. Under his feet, Meryem could see the dirty leftovers of the plaster fell down from the ceiling, looking like a disturbed winter lake.

It was flanked on its northern side by gang territory. The name however, gave the residents a feeling of progress, a sense that they were in some way different to the residents of Covent Gardens, Quarry Road and Tumbler Lane. And they were. They were the people who had either gotten clerical positions in government offices or, through menial labour, had managed to earn honestly and saved enough to build a modest life. Jobs were difficult to come by when city folk read the address \u2018Soldado\u2019 on employment forms. Everyone knew where that was. Crime was big business there. But \u2018Beverly Hills, Soldado\u2019 inspired some measure of confidence. The residents of the little neighbourhood that numbered only thirty-five households, had created a space for themselves. \n\nThe women of Soldado, many of them single mothers, had taken up the job of gatekeepers. They were strong women, aggressive in built, in personalities, and sometimes both. Their aggression fueled their children\u2019s motivation to excel. These were not women who envisioned grand jobs for their children. They simply wanted them to stay out of the gangs\u2019 way, to not find themselves in recruitment activities that would bind them for life and eventually death, to gang life. They simply wanted that their children have a chance at life. \n\nAlex, looked at his neighbourhood not with the child\u2019s eye that had seen his world as big. At three feet, spaces could seem larger than they were but now, at fourteen years old and moving up to five feet, three inches, he felt the space shrinking. School had opened up his world for he was now attending high school. It had placed him among students from various backgrounds including those from wealth. The affluence he had known was the one his mother had created. \n\nA single mother, she had refused, like some of the other women in Soldado, to welcome another man into her life. As far as she was concerned\n\n\u2018At least your father had the decency to disappear and not show his face here again.\u2019\n\nMiss Mary as she was known, earned a living by washing and ironing people\u2019s laundry. All her clients came from the affluent part of the city that lay only two kilometers away from Soldado.  She didn\u2019t think cleaning homes was an option because she declared that \u2018that was a recipe for unemployment.\u2019 \nHaving access to the inside of people\u2019s homes made it easy for them to brand you a thief if something went missing. Even if you came from Beverly Hills, the truth was that it was still a part of Soldado. She had decided that collecting the laundry to wash and iron at her own home was a better idea.\n\nA meticulous woman, she had devised her own system \u2018to ensure transparency\u2019, a big term she was fond of quoting. She had bought herself a reporter\u2019s notebook and some carbon paper. She made a checklist of the items collected and provided her clients with a copy of the list made possible by this carbon paper technology. When she returned the clothes, she requested the receiver\u2019s signature.

He sits in the rocking chair as mourners gather. He holds the doctor\u2019s postmortem report. \u201cEctopic pregnancy\u201d, the word resounds in his mind several times. He is too lazy to google it. For years,actually, four years since they were married. They had tried for a child. Now, the child had come, years when they had almost given up hope. But now she is gone, alongside with the child they had both prayed for. The child he will never get to see; or touch. And his lovely Miranda, just a memory on the photographs in the album.</p>  <p>Here. Now. It is in the strong winds that blow, the winds of the Great Victoria lake. It is in the random stranger who smiles down upon a beggar child on a dark corner of the ghettos of Kampala. It is in the rain that falls on a dusty day.

He was brought by fiery flames into unknown depths of water. And from this first deep, mystical, but violent setting, he took his first breath of air. Unconsciously, later on, he even wanted to be the Air and to walk the Earth, as long as he could, until he disintegrates and becomes Nothing. The water was his motherly shelter, but he never felt at home here.  Surely, a home cannot be a place you crave to leave? The home has to be the place you want to be, the place you want to own ! Like... the fire. \n\nMark wanted fire and the fire was his father.  His father left. Or he was abandoned. Since he was seven years old, Mark was able to interpret this event, just like this, in two ways.  ''My father left me'' or ''I abandoned my dad''. This way of thinking formed a certain duality within Mark's own personality which he, often, mistaken for his true identity. \n\nThis very thought of his own father leaving him, started the fire within Mark himself and the more he thought this way, the more he felt the flames of his father.  But what he felt was anger.  For a child, especially a male child, growing up in a patriarchal surroundings, anger was often mistaken for power, and power was utterly masculinity itself. The father was present. \n\nIf Mark would think differently, if he would interpret things in the manner that he abandoned his dad, Mark would feel guilty. He would blame himself and very soon, he'd transfer this blame to his mother and everyone else.  How many days or hours before blame  becomes despise?

She did not think of them as most people, hunters or innocent watchers alike, would. They were not fragile or cloddish in her religious perception. They were the freest creature that the Almighty has created. He, with his endless benevolence and love for creation, marked them as the ultimate example of free will bent and twisted to serve a higher purpose. They were, in her opinion, the perfect platonic extension of the Holy Ghost. The mere fact that most birds build their own nests with such weak elements \u2013 twigs and whatnot \u2013 and in the most unimaginably strategic ways was a full of vindication of God\u2019s presence within every denizen of the earth. Sister Azniv often thought of herself as a bird. She has been well over forty years in the service of God and the loyal bride of the Christ, though she did not particularly condone the entire concept of the latter. She understood very well the outline of her looks, and like many of her predecessors, she used her mien as a means of authority. There was nothing more assertive than a wise, wrinkly face clad in a nun\u2019s habit. And to accentuate this very point, Sister Azniv purses her lips behind her writing desk, suspicious of someone \u2013 an unwanted spirit, perhaps \u2013 scrutinizing her discreetly. She was no pigeon, of course, but a sharp-eyed eagle who detected sinners from a fifty-kilometer radius. \u201cThe devil smells like rotten cabbages,\u201d she\u2019d often whisper, then add: \u201cAnd I am yet to make a cabbage soup.\u201d She was right. This prophecy of hers was only confirmed when, on a certain night, Sister Azniv came to her bedroom only to find a hunched demon sitting at the end of her bed with a cabbage soup. \u201cWhat did I tell you about eating in bed?\u201d she said sternly. Later that evening, Sister Talar was found sprawled on the church terrace. Someone had pushed her, or she had pushed herself. Who knew? This event was later referred to as The Shooting Star Incident. The papers were cruel. [/quote]\n\n  \n\n### Response\n\nSister Talar had been found lifeless on the terrace with hands folded in prayer and an expression of perfect peace on the eve of one of the most spectacular meteor showers in recorded history. Since then Sister Talar would appear in Sister Azniv's dreams whenever she ate cabbage soup. The last person to see sister Talar was sister Amina who reported that Sister Talar had been craving cabbage soup all day. Was her death related to the mess in the kitchen that overlooked the terrace? The entire pot of soup she had been craving was missing altogether. Some opted for the theory of suicide at the outrage of sister Talar's family. Of course the papers were cruel, people don't get murdered over soup! \n\nWhen in dreams Sister Talar would appear to Sister Azniv as a mute with singing birds encircling her. Sometimes the birds would carry her on their wings or dangling from their beaks. Her eyes said nothing and he lips were unreadable. Sister Azniv tried in vain to get a response out of this apparation and the only time Sister Talar had opened her mouth a swallow flew out of it.\n\nAs a memorial to Sister Talar the perish planted a cherry tree near the terrace which now housed a family of sparrows. Sister Azniv was fond of reading her bible by it. Its like the bird songs were the sound track to her conversations with God. Had she heard them already in her dreams, or did she hear the songs in her dreams because of the afternoons she spent sitting by Sister Azniv's tree? Cabbage soup, once a mainstay of the kitchen had become a stigmatized dish with the locals. As a result the kitchen came up with every alternative use for cabbage in kim chi, slaw, stir fry, even cabbage wraps.\n\n\"Why should I be afraid of eating from the bounty of our land?\" thought sister Azniv. Without wanting to startle anyone sister Azniv had resolved to make her own dinner this evening, a nice cabbage soup.", "created_at": "2020-01-20 01:22:45.210724", "updated_at": "2020-02-07 22:36:57.512418", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 889, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 3.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [709], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1444, "user_id": 452, "topic_id": 802, "post_number": 1, "raw": "## Unpromted contribution\n\nShe is dreamy.

The bellowing of invites to these different destinations jostles in her ear. A knock against the window startles her and brings her back to now. A little girl raises a plastic bag of frozen bottled water against the window of the Tshova Mbayiwa public commuter mini bus and signals for Brenda to open. She opens the window. A revolting armpit brushes against Brenda's nostrils as the girl stretches her arm through the open window in an exchange of a bottle of water for a worn out U.S dollar from the passenger sitting next to Brenda. Brenda looks away and her eyes fall on a boy. He stands outside the taxi blocking the entrance; picking his nose with one hand while the other holds an empty cup.  He reluctantly shakes his cup in a somewhat disinterested plea for help. Brenda has no interest in throwing any coins in his cup and the boy appears to have no interest in going away or doing anything for that matter. The boy somehow reminds Brenda of her own son. Not because of any similar physical features, but because the boy is just about her sons age. Thinking of her son compels Brenda to dig into her purse for some coins which she throws in the boy\u2019s cup. The boy does not smile; or even say thank you.

I reached for the cat and scooped it into my arms. He hissed violently, scratching my arm before leaping off down the hallway. My heart palpitated. I debated whether to follow him; whisper his name or rush back to my room. Logic, fear rather, detected that I retreated to my room. I briskly walked back, fearing to run, in case I made a sound. I locked the door and jumped straight into bed. Covered my head and listened attentively for any unusual sound. I heard movement in the house. It could not be mom and dad. I would have heard their car. I uncovered my head and stared, wide eyed, into the condensed darkness that filled the room. The sound was gone. I nonetheless rummaged for my cell-phone from under my pillow and dialled dad\u2019s number. \n\u2018Damn! Voicemail.' Why does he tell me to call if something is wrong if he can\u2019t keep his damned phone on?\u2019 I cursed internally. \n\nThe sound was back again. I covered my head once more; shut my eyes and tried to pray.  I was never a religious person, but the situation dictated that I prayed or summoned some other form of divine intervention. My parents being devout Christians, the only thing I could think of was prayer. Unfortunately, the only two prayers I could assemble were the \u201cThank you Lord for the food we eat\u201d prayer we learnt in Kindergarten and the \u201cour father\u201d prayer from Sunday school.

Novelists, poets, philosophers, self-help gurus and bloggers have written about it. My favourite quote comes from Oscar Wilde. \"Drink is the curse of the working class and work is the curse of the drinking class.\" In my younger, wilder years(pardon the pun), I would drink like there was no tomorrow. At that age, you think you're more super than Superman. If my now older and relatively milder self could speak to the younger me, it would probably say, \"Quit this shit before your liver quits.\" My younger, cynical, skeptical self was never partial to sips of wisdom from sages who've drunk from founts of knowledge (or exotic drinking holes from imaginary worlds). To my younger self, my 'beer peers'and drinking(without thinking) buddies, this was a rite of passage (or a swaying bridge depending on your tolerance for alcohol). We were best pals with Johnny, Jim and Jack. On a journey of thrills and spills, till we(or at least some of us) saw light. Countless hangovers never taught me anything of value. I finally achieved an epiphany, strangely enough after a serious case of alcohol poisoning. A particularly ambitious night of drinking and merry-making, resulted in severe diarrhoea and vomitting. So my moment of clarity was not accompanied by a choir of angels or a band of demons brandishing pitch forks but by repeatedly puking my guts out in the toilet. Yes, not quite the inspiring, soul-stirring tale but a tale of caution nonetheless. If my liver were capable of speech, it would speak volumes of pushing the limits of tolerance to the point of stupidity. However stupidity in my case led to humility. There's nothing more humbling than sitting in the toilet, wondering which orifice to expect the next installment of muck from. So lesson learned.

This disease will undoubtedly kill me but not before reducing me to a vegetable. An irony wasted on a lifelong vegetarian like myself. So much for the benefits of a vegetarian diet.\n\nRather than suffering further indignity, I decided to take matters into my own hands. With my meager pension, I planned to admit myself into a facility in Switzerland. The Swiss being a practical and enlightened lot have legalised euthanasia.\n\nI read with dismay, the letter informing of your wish to take a 'contractually agreed sabbatical.' Allow me to clarify some issues.\n\nFirstly, I find your need for a sabbatical utterly preposterous. Since when do entities of your ilk take sabbaticals? Sabbaticals and contracts are for mere mortals not 'The Grim Reaper.'\n\nSecondly your decision, far from being a minor inconvenience, has thrown a 'proverbial spanner in the works'for my merciful death. Your lack of dedication prompts me to doubt your commitment to 'quality performance.' Your plan will result in the endless suffering of millions like myself, with a death sentence minus the certainty of death any time soon.\n\nThat you plan to return to your responsibilities when sufficiently recharged and refocused does not fill me with confidence.     \nMore alarming and distressing is the lack of a return date in your letter. The offer of continuing with our lives while generous, lacks compassion and an understanding of the needs of the life-challenged like myself.\n\nI regret that I must take this matter up with your superiors.

The box was carried by the man through the aisles of the shop, as he went looking for his best friend who the man had just almost recognized when he passed by along one of the fruit baskets that happened to contain some nameless fruit of unknown origin since he wasn't from around the area where this shop was located and couldn't remember much of how he'd got there in the first place. The fruit agitated the dog and they eventually left without finding the man's best friend. He threw the box with the dog in the back of his pickup and drove on an empty highway since the night was full and the season unpopular and less populated. The heat never gave up in this period of history and the man couldn't think straight or even less than usual. The crookedness ever a surprise in degrees. He and the pickup and the box and the dog drove seemingly to the sea despite any fragility and spent the rest of the night on the beach among the smells of fish and ants and moldy old nuts. The man let the dog out of the box and together they lay down on the beach among the trash and the plastic cups and the drink tickets and the spread residue of love and lust that neither the man nor the dog could imagine themselves part of.

If I am lucky I will get more than thirty seconds of \u2018peace\u2019 before a small child (mine \u2013 so it\u2019s kind of my own fault) will come and, at best, stand outside the door shouting \u201cDING DONG DING DONG DING DONG DING DONG\u201d until I answer or, at worst, just burst straight in and leave the door open for all to see.

A great deal of certainty and an inability to fray at the edges, either literally or metaphorically.\n\nIn my mind I pretend I am in a country where living space is at an absolute premium.

Who better than Moll Flanders -- who, with the help of literary necromantic abracadabra, was brought to life -- to bear Rump's child? \n\n\"Just don't send me back to those awful pages\" was the only condition she stated when the deal was presented. Flanders did not take any offence as to why she was chosen; anyone who could perform simple mathematical equations could easily calculate the ratio of Moll's strength to the amount of bullshit men bestowed on her: Moll Flanders had insurmountable tolerance. \n\nThe sex was over sooner than expected. Moll grew quickly weary and bored of Rump's rhythmic movements that seemed overly methodical -- inexperienced was the right word. \n\n\"When was the last time you f---ed your wife?\" Moll said, rolling over the bed as she fixed her bra. \n\n\"F---ed? You mean fucked?\" Rump asked.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Can't you just say the word...? Or is it too... vulgar?\"\n\nMoll fixed him with her gaze. \"Had it been my f---ing choice, I would've f---ing said f--- all the f---ing time, but the author would never let me. F---ing censorship.\"\n\n\"Ah...\"\n\n\"How come you get to say it?\" Moll began picking up her neatly folded clothes that fit the century.\n\n\"Oh, well. We live in different times. Fuck is the least offensive word, actually.\" \n\nGoldie waited in a nearby cafe during the entire encounter. When the moment came, she found it completely exasperating to willingly offer her man to a woman -- cuckoldry in reverse. Yet Goldie's love was made of iron, or so she believed. Back in their room, Rump and Moll were saying their very last farewells. As Rump gallantly showed her to the door -- as though chivalry after what he'd done would display courtesy in his character -- Moll turned to him and said, as an afterthought: \"You do know that this is going to be a ghost-baby, right?\" \n\nRump's eyes widened.", "created_at": "2020-04-01 22:20:54.389266", "updated_at": "2020-04-01 22:20:54.389266", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 444, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 23.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [2005], "is_liked_by": [354], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4044, "user_id": 335, "topic_id": 888, "post_number": 23, "raw": "J\u00f8rgen and the old woman, Lillith Beulah, became inseparable over a matter of days, like a Harold and Maude of the Underworld.

Or maybe they just flaunt them more. Mine are well inside. The condensation on the windows is terrible. This was always going to be temporary, this strange perch on the edge of everything, barren and cold. So cold. I would curl up like a foetus under my quilt and a heap of my clothes and still be cold.\n\nI live in a land of traffic lights and bird-muck, plumes of vape smoke blown over a shoulder in your face, water dripping in big blobs into the tunnel, the river rushing, devoid of kingfishers, otters or anything interesting. It only has bats in summer, tiny blurs you'll miss if you blink.\n\nThen, the triangle, where tram tracks criss-cross, and people rev their motorbikes, and beyond it all there is a pizza place, underground, and that is where everything kind of began. Not at once. There were lots of little bits of beginning. \n\nI was told the best time of my life would be when I first got a job and could go out each night and spend my money. I would get pizza and ask them to add mushrooms, then work my way through their dessert menu.  \n\nI walked up and out one night and it was snowing in that dark square of outside, the lights from the towers opposite looking epic.

[/quote]\n\n  \n\n### Response\n\nI went to various gyms, back home - home being a number of cities and countries, just wherever I rolled up. Sometimes in my building there would be a tiny room on the first floor or in the basement, with a permanently-open barred window letting in cold air and food smells from the street. My neighbours who I never spoke to would occasionally come in and out, behaving like Olympic athletes - maybe they were. There was an Eastern European woman once who I think was a professional; she was fast and strong and when I did lose weight she would comment. But mainly few or no word passed between us - us being me and any of them. I couldn't tell you who lived next door to me most of the time. Life was a lobby, stairs, a corridor, a door - my door - then click, lock, my world now, my desk, shower, bed.\n\nA couple gyms I went to were really swimming pools with gyms tacked on, and often the gym was tucked in a strange place to fit it in, or broken in little bits around the building, meaning you had to drag yourself from the treadmill, down the balcony overlooking the pool, to the weights machines. It wasn't the end of the world. Just felt like a labyrinth. I fainted once in a gym like that, in the locker room. A woman asked, vaguely interested, if I was okay. I dragged myself to a bus and home.\n\nMy soup and rice arrived, with a small heap of veggies. In the doorway I forced myself to close my eyes, inhale its scent,find pleasure in it, this moment of eating to live, to get through the next few hours. I could diet later, buy new clothes, go running - who was I kidding, I would never go running. I let the curry dance on the roof of my mouth, swallowed and felt the burn swim down to my stomach. I pressed a hand to it instinctively, then slid it away, opening my eyes, sure the gaze of the street was on my swollen gut.

It is the time traveller. The softness that lies within, a shell of ones one bone. The egg is in constant flux between the before and the promise of an after. It is a meditation on the reality of uncertainty that all things in the universe hold. The universe is an unconfined egg, a becoming of ones own mother. The egg shows the potential of egg(mother)hood, beyond the capsule or container. The egg is the start of time and the ghost of the future. The classic \u201dchicken or the egg\u201d question, is the very foundation of the physics of time in a entangled word. The egg can be viewed upon as food, but not by the chickens, never by their creators, food is merely a meal, and the chickens know that their are bigger philosophies than the philosophy of the meal.\nEvery 10 year old is obliged to carry an egg with them at all times for a whole year in order to learn about care and the fragility of life.\n* THE HAMMER strokes your chin oh so softly.

One could say the hammer is the ocean, but the water itself would then be the orchid. If the hammer is the wind, the orchid is the air. The hammer is the cause of a-lot of sleepless nights and mornings, its the glue and the scissor that lays between our neighbors (between relations). The hammer is double egged in that sense that, if you hit someone with the hammer in their kneecap, your kneecap will be broken too. Every mark you leave on other bodies will appear on your too. The same applies when building a house or a chair.\n* THE ORCHID is a mystery, a question, a guess we will never know the answer too. The orchid is the artist, portraying the worlds as a mirror image, as an afterthought, as an imperfect replica designed to expand the consciousness of the world. The orchid is the very representation of the universe (the egg) constantly expanding through its tapping into what is already there. The orchid can swallow you whole, its vulnerability is its greatest strength. The orchid is the observer that sometime shares clues about the world that we can try, but never fully decipher. The orchid has felt the dinosaurs disappear, they remember it clearly, and store the information in the water they touch through their roots. The orchid touches everything.\n[/quote]\n\n\nCaverley had read this passage many times, but it never ceased to amuse her. So clear, so succinct. It wasn't something written by a random John Doe. Whoever compiled these urban legends *knew something*. No, they knew *more* than something. Caverley had not been back to the University since she took out the book all those years prior, mainly because she never returned the book. She did not want to return the book. She could not return the book. The book spoke to her and wanted to lead her to something. That something was the house. \n\n\"Why do you want this job, Ms. Caverley\" asked Chief Inspector Kissenger \"It's not an easy position. It's not an office job, hell it ain't even a standard cop job\". \n\n\"I'm well aware, sir\". Caverley's voice was soft, sweet and polite. Just as it always was. \"I'm simply interested in this sort of thing. I always have had an interest in urban legends and, dare I say, the paranormal. I know that a lot of people don't believe in ghosts and things - maybe you don't either and just want something who's educated in the topic to go take a look. Well, I'm that exact person\". \n\n\"Hit the nail on the head, miss. I don't believe in all this ghosty, demony, poltergeist crap. I've chased criminals for over twenty years and at least half of them have said they've been possessed to do shit. It's not true, I'm telling you as a fact. They were bad people who did bad things, that's all. \n\nOne man tore an innocent dog apart with a fork, etched weird symbols all over the corpse; and what did he say when I caught him? Nothing. Nothing at all. Just muttered weird sounds. Didn't even speak English. Probably a foreigner gone mad. That's another thing, I ain't a fan of them either\". \n\n\"Dogs, officer?\"\n\n\"No, foreigners. Don't get 'em. Anyway Miss. Caverley, or should I say Madam Caverley, you got the job. Now go and find out what all this bullshit's about. Any questions?\"\n\n\"Just one, sir. If you don't mind me asking\"\n\n\"Call me Henry. Not at all, please go ahead\"\n\n\"Thanks, Henry. You can call me Juliette, now that we're on friendly terms. Why is it exactly that you want this house investigated, if you don't believe in such things?\"\n\n\"My boss asked me to dig it out. Superintendent Loviston. He believes in this stuff and thought 'hey if I ain't gonna do it, I'll get Kissenger to do it'. Wish he did it himself, added a bunch of work for me that I ain't got time for. So, Juliette, that's where you come in. You know all about this crap, you do it for me. Now, if you'd excuse me, I've got to get back to the real crimes\". \n\n\"With pleasure, Henry\". \n\nHenry Kissenger did not leave a good taste in Caverley's mouth. Not that it mattered, she didn't need him. She just needed an excuse to investigate - without any blame, without any feelings, without any judgement. Knowledge.

The highway has patches of grass between the turn offs, and the kids have taken to playing soccer there because the gangsters don't bother them and there are lights. There are no street lights in the newer occupations, the older informal settlements still use temporary toilets and something called high-mass lights. They are 40 meters tall, the type you usually see at stadiums, except the lights shine in all directions from it's head. They look more like aliens in the war of the worlds film. They aren't technically at war though. They have the kind of peace that the rest of the world still regards as a miracle. In the shadows of the high mass lights, women get raped walking to the toilets at night. But this doesn't happen as regularly any more. Women know not to go to the toilet at night, and women and men alike from the community will blame her for the rape if she did.  The police don't enter the areas. Most of the houses have small, unpaved and muddy foot paths between them and the police aren't trained to patrol by foot. They wouldn't anyway. They know not to risk their lives for something as stupid as a patrol. The majority of police are stationed in cleaner, less dense and well lit suburbs. They are stationed where crime doesn't happen in a city where violent crimes are normal. We never go out at night. The women are strong and resilient. They find ways to support each other, keep their children fed and make make time to pray that their children are not murdered or end up in a gang. They don't have jobs. Most people that live here don't have jobs. They were intentionally given an inferior education to prevent them from succeeding. The younger rainbow nation are suppose to have it all, but that is just for billboards or talks on Oprah. Mothers form walking school buses to protect the primary school children on the way to school. The idea is that their bodies will provide shielding from stray bullets.

Rates of domestic violence and  fetal alcohol syndrome are among the highest in the world. The people are angry and they protest regularly. It is legal to protest. They go to the doors of parliament and hand over a memorandum then return home with empty bellies. The homes, or the occupations as the experts prefer to call it,  get taken down by police while they are not there. The police remove the homes because the local government doesn't approve. The occupations have made these homes illegally and so they get destroyed. There is nowhere else for them to live. The army are currently patrolling the streets, they are also torturing people.

I was six when we moved in, not quite school age, still full of the fantastic, imaginary world of the unwearied mind.\n\nThe tree was so many things: a space rocket, a monster, a wind-torn cliff from which I would dangle, saving humanity, one superhero feat at a time. It was just outside my window, all gnarled and battered, ugly, probably, to the jaded adult eye, but to me it was a monument, an evergreen promise of experience.\n\nOnce, while climbing in its upper branches, I discovered a nest, in which were three, tiny eggs. The eggs were blue and not much bigger than marbles. I knew, even in my six-year-old mind, not to touch them, to leave them be because they were little houses for even littler babies. I saw eggs hatch on a nature show, the kind of thing Mom always encouraged me to watch, and knew there were tiny, helpless birds in there, waiting fro the right time to emerge, screaming and blind, into the great big Outside. I was entranced.\n\nEvery day, I would climb to an adjacent branch to see if they had hatched. Mom would stand on the back porch, smiling and admonishing me to be careful, as I scampered up the tree. I felt like a big brother, looking over a crib made of twigs at my siblings, triplets, all cozy and safe by reason of altitude.\n\n\"Be mindful that the babies are coming soon, so You may have to stop climbing up there so much. The momma bird will not be happy about intruders!\" Mom cautioned from the back porch as I tore off toward the cypress.\n\n\"I will, Mom!\" I retorted, leaping to grab the lowest branch, my ersatz ladder rung.\n\nOne day, I heard tiny screeches from the branches above me. The babies had hatched! I was so excited, I nearly slipped off a branch. I peered into the nest from a branch further away than my customary position, not wanting to disturb the little ones. They were ugly-cute, tiny, screaming fuzzballs hollering for food, chastising their Mom for taking too long to come back with juicy insects or tasty seeds.\n\nWhen I told Mom, she was delighted but gave me further admonishment to keep my distance \"For now, you needn't be climbing the tree. Let the birdies grow; your shaking of the branches might disturb them.\" she warned.\n\nMom bought me cheap binoculars so I could keep an eye on the little guys. I could sit in an upstairs window and just barely see the nest through the branches. It was my ritual to eat my lunch whilst checking their progress, mouth full of peanut butter and bread, peering though my binoculars, a happy little voyeur.\n\nA week or so after the birds had hatched, I was playing in the yard, having already concluded my voyeurism for the day. I noticed a tiny ball of what looked like a large dandelion head lying under the tree. When I went to investigate, I realized it was one of the hatchlings! I ran up the back steps, yelling bloody murder.\n\n\"Mom! Mom! MOM! One of the birdies! Come quick!\" my voice straining for volume, cracking with panic.\n\nMom soon appeared from the dining room, pleading for me to calm down. She got a small basket from  the pantry and a napkin, and followed me to the spot. She knelt, the napkin clutched in one hand to act as a glove with which to pick up the poor, little bird. When she did so, she made a tiny sound of dismay, her brows coming together in a sad frown.\n\n\"I'm afraid this fellow didn't make it, little one.\" she whispered.\n\nI didn't know what she meant right away. She had to explain that the little bird had fallen from the nest and died. She explained that even baby birds sometimes died because nature was 'just that way'. She told me she would take care of the 'body', a context in which I had never heard that word used before.\n\nI was inconsolable for a couple of days, earning all my favorite meals and even ice cream. It was my introduction to The End, the finality and permanence of death. I was heartbroken and I do not think I ever truly recovered, even now, in my adulthood.\n\nNow, hovering above the hospital bed, I see Mom, quiet and still, nested among blankets and sheets, her silence even more distinct for the cacophony of the array of beeping electronic instruments. I had thought my mind could but barely abide the breaking wrought by the death of that tiny bird decades ago. I was wrong; I did not know heartbreak, truly, in its helpless, black depth, until it was my Momma Bird lying in the linen grass below me.\n\nHow does a person survive this?

It\u2019s a privilege to have lived out my adolescence in a one-of-a-kind house, its quirks long faded into the background of grantednesses taken.\n\nIt is also moms\u2019 favorite room and its peculiar Feng Shui is ever subject to her dynamic personality, having gone through many a reinvention over the last three decades. Her persistence in continuously transforming into new wondrous forms is key to how she is the love of dad\u2019s life and the matriarch of the family.\n\nI look up from my breakfast cereal to see her marching in, emanating vigor from her afternoon massage. My mother is small of frame, a contrast to the strength within. Her hair is grey, not yet white and her figure is marked by the tidal struggle between her disciplined training regimens and her love of life and food and wine.\n\n\u201cI have fired my purchaser,\u201d she proclaims. Her words have that familiar tone of pride and freshness and renewal.\n\n\u201cIan has tracked down and snagged so many wonderful pieces for us over the last few years, but our tastes have grown apart. Out with the old, in with the new.\u201d\n\nI look at the wall where one of the paintings hang. It is a classic, if unremarkable forest landscape that has whimsically been invaded by two trolls skillfully painted over by some comical postmodernist dilettante. The trolls appear to be attempting to escape the frame they are imprisoned in. On the wall directly besides a third troll has been painted by my mother. It has a longing look on its face as it looks towards its friends inside.\n\n\u201cI suppose the trolls will soon be united in oblivion then,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ll miss them.\u201d\n\nShe leans her against the kitchen counter top that protrudes awkwardly into the atrium.\n\n\u201cI have half a mind to donate them to the kindergarten and transplant their little friend along with them,\u201d she beams. \u201cOr maybe I could redo him on the f\u2026\u201d\n\nHer smile disappears. \u201cOn the fr\u2026.\u201d She stutters, reaching out and steadying herself on the counter. An icy feeling runs up my spine. Something is wrong. Mom is never at a loss for words. I\u2019m not thinking this, but some part of me knows this to be true even so.\n\n\u201cMom? What is it?\u201d\n\nTime slows to a crawl. I\u2019m on my feet even as her legs are buckling under her.\n\n\u201cMom!\u201d\n\nShe slumps to the floor in slow motion. I rush to catch her before she can fall any further.\n\n\u201cWhat is it mom? Are you having a stroke?\u201d\n\nHer eyes are open, searching, full of fear. Her presence fades from her face.\n\n\u201cTom!!\u201d I yell at my cousin who\u2019s sitting in the couch on the far side of the room, on his laptop. He looks up with widening eyes. \u201cCall an ambulance! Right now!\u201d He reacts.\n\nI\u2019m holding her body, cradling her as she once cradled me. Rocking back and forth.

I draw air back in, wanting to say something important.

What the hell did *she* have to be suspicious of? She was the one always up to some sort of mischief and in any case, if there were any foul trick afoot, it had clearly befallen my head.\n\nFinally, she said, \"You cut your hair,\" which was so utterly banal and unnecessary that I flung the file I was working on at her. At once, the file exploded and showered us with newspaper clippings, old receipts, candid photos of the dashing vagabond who seemed to live in the laundromat downstairs. She shrieked and tackled me through the fluttering papers.\n\nAs I wrestled her across the dusty floor, papers crinkling beneath us, I couldn't help but let out a huff of breathless laughter. Lin for all that I hated her, loved her, always knew how to break the tension in me and knock me out of my misshapen head. I laughed again when I felt her fingers scrape across my fresh-buzzed scalp. No more hair for the brat to yank at whenever we got into one of our tizzies. \n\nEventually we collapsed in a pile in the middle of the room. Her fingers found my head again. They rubbed inquisitive circles into my skull as I told her my theories of Japanese heads and Buddhist monks.\n\n\"My ma's Chinese,\" said Lin, who was Chinese, and also reigning champion of pointing out the painfully obvious. \"But she was from Southeast Asia so we like our noggins round. Like a ball. Aesthetically symmetrical. She'd sit me on her lap and rub my head like a crystal ball. And that's why I'd look way better if I ever did something as stupid as shaving my head.\"\n\nOur positioning was just so that I couldn't reach her long braided hair, still thick and lush despite being bleached pale blond, but when I kicked out with my left foot, it connected solidly with her stomach. She grunted and got up and started yanking me around again. I resisted until I realised she had seated me in her lap and was now rubbing my head with both hands in slow isometric circles.\n\n\"We can still fix this,\" she hums, \"We can still fix you.\"", "created_at": "2020-03-19 03:46:45.235249", "updated_at": "2020-03-19 06:47:38.205680", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 413, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 19.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [349], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2816, "user_id": 463, "topic_id": 898, "post_number": 2, "raw": "In a basement a hundred miles away, a man with no name floats in a sensory deprivation tank. Tangles of cables spill out from the tank and run across the raw concrete floor to dozens of ports scattered around the walls. Some connect to the fractured remains of the nation's networks, some connect to the drone hangar on the roof, some connect to military grade communications hardware scattered throughout several cities across the eastern seaboard. These all act as the man's eyes, extensions of a withered physical form that no longer has any purpose other than keeping his brain alive.\n\nIt is a brain seething with machines from before the war, when such marvellous and horrendous technology was still legal. The man's mind processes sensory input and information at a rate far beyond any human capacity, and much more dynamically than any artificial equivalent. This allowed him and the others to be the exceptional pilots, but it also drove them all into emotional states that no one is ever supposed to be in.\n\nThe man sometimes watches the only two of his fellow pilots that are still alive. One of them is in a facility in Colorado owned by a private security firm, plugged into much more modern machines. The man has toyed with the idea of turning off her life support, since he knows that an existence such as theirs, especially when used for commercial purposes, brings pain both physical and mental. Perhaps he will one day when he is done with his own wretched life. Such interference would surely lead to being found here in the basement.\nThe other is in a hospital in Los Angeles, without any kind of digital presence apart from a document designating him as John Doe, patient 224892. He spends his days in the corner of his room, drooling and shitting himself, cut off from the world in every way imaginable.\n\nThere are rumors of a third, shot down and captured alive, and sold to the Chinese. The man wants to find him, but the firewalls around what is considered the last nation state on Earth are too massive to penetrate without being detected.\n\nWhile the man in the tank watches and listens through Jimmy's VA, he compiles a file on Jimmy. No record of ever going to school, an on and off girlfriend that died years ago with a needle in her arm, several arrests for various misdemeanors, a conviction from he was 15 that has been sealed. The man peels back the layers of pathetic security around the records and finds the story of a boy selling sex for cigarettes and pocket change. He makes a mental note to track down the people that bought him and feed their data into the sexual predator database that is miraculously still being used by what used to be the vice divisions of several different police departments.\n\nSuch a sordid and typical story. And now, Jimmy is being pulled further into the world that he has merely skirted before, a world whose only purpose as far as Jimmy is concerned has been to spit out whatever substances he has needed to dull himself.\n\nThe man attaches the file and the video and audio captures from the VA and the camera outside Jimmy's door to a message and sends it. The receiving party is hidden behind layers of digital subterfuge, but to the man in the tank they are as easy to tear apart as wet paper. He knows that the woman reading the message is Valentina Volkova, the COO of an organisation that exists in the gray area between a number of Russian conglomerates and the Solntevskaya Bratva.\n\nMinutes after the message is sent, the man is informed that a substantial amount of money has been deposited in one of his many accounts. He cares little for money himself but keeps enough to cover his expenses and sometimes the purchase of some new hardware. The rest goes through several intermediaries into a fund.

He stood leaning against a wall, off to the side all casual like, looking out the window. Rupert wasn't sure he really was a priest, but he wore a cassock and a simple crucifix. The hem of the cassock, right in Rupert's field of view, was frayed and dirty.\n\n\"For example,\" the priest continued, \"Bird here is a sinner of the highest order.\" He nodded towards the guy holding the hammer, then went back to looking out the window. It was sunny outside, and Rupert could hear a bird chirping.\n\"He has committed many dark deeds in his time,\" the priest said, \"but recently he has done so with a higher purpose, have you not, brother Bird?\"\n\nThe guy, Bird, grunted briefly, and the hammerhead shifted slightly on Rupert's head. He pushed his head down as hard as he could, grinding his cheek into the rough wooden floor, trying in vain to escape the hammer's touch. He couldn't have stopped even if he wanted to. The image of that hammer crushing his skull like an egg kept playing over and over in his head.\n\n\"So, sin is relative to the goal the sinner is trying to achieve,\" the priest continued. \"Twenty-seven years ago, Bird strangled a man with his bare hands over a bag of cocaine. Was that a goal worthy of such a sin? To Bird, at that time, it certainly was. But in the grand scheme of things?\"\n\nThe priest stretched his arms towards the ceiling, rolling his shoulders with audible pops. He looked like he might be in his sixties, but he could just as easily have been forty with a life of hardships behind him.\n\n\"When you look at the bigger picture, Bird's sins are insignificant, just like those of most violent men. It's all a matter of scale. Bird was an insignificant man before I found him. Now, he has found his calling and become something else entirely. Isn't that true, brother Bird?\"\n\nBird grunted again. The priest turned from the window and squatted down. Slowly, with great care, he placed four steel nails, each about eight inches long, upright in a neat row in front of Rupert's face. His fingernails were yellow from years of smoking.\n\n\"Now, Rupert,\" the priest said. \"We can do this one of two ways. You tell me what I want to know and we all leave here happy as clams, or you remain silent and I will have Bird here put these nails...\" He tapped one of the nails with his fingertip, making it wobble slightly. \"...through your hands and feet.\"\n\nThe priest smiled.

The pub wasn't one I frequented. A beautiful old building, the Victorian's knew how to build. But the pub itself wasn't well loved. It was one of the less...*savory* in this area. So much gentrification around and abouts. I'm not complaining, progress is good. Although, as someone who rents it generally means I am on a short leash to being priced out of this area. But this pub has, so far, resisted the updates. \nIt only serves cider. Proper, real cider. The sort that isn't fizzy or filled with a sugary sweetness that screams 'mainstream drinkers are my target'. This pub was a place for the connoisseur of fermented apples. Sandwiched between the little Spa shop and the dry cleaner's. A nondescript three storey terraced pub. Narrow, simple. Two windows breadth, apart from the ground floor which was one window and the door, with its cheerful but old sign. \"The Horse and Cart\" written in peeling gold paint with a once-bright red behind it. Apparently it also serves really great pork pies. But I don't know about pork. Although I don't practice the religion of my birth (can you be religious from birth? I don't think it is actually possible, but since I now define myself as an atheist perhaps I am ill-equipped to effectively discuss that) I have never tried anything from a pig. Even though they do, oftentimes, explore my olfactory in a most pleasing way.\nBut here, shortly before 11pm on a Tuesday night there was a patron leaving the pub in a very curious way. So I stopped to watch as they tried to exit the pub in an unconventional fashion, with only one shoe, a small crowd underneath who seemed to have just noticed them, and what looked like a distinct discomfort between their legs.\nLondon rarely fails to entertain me. Although born in a mountainous region of a place that remains too dangerous to (probably ever) return to I have become a big fan of a city. Surprises around virtually every corner.\nAnd this one? Well, certainly worth perching on the wall to watch for a bit. What on earth is that guy doing? What does he *think* he's doing?

They had been grueling weeks of 12 hour days and no weekends, but the price in the human sphere was racking up quickly and there was no time to waste. Since first landfall of humanity's amphibious enemy, raids on coastal settlements had cost the lives of a good two hundred thousand people. Those people weren't merely casualties. They were protein for the horde of sea people. Devoured. The thought still made Venke sick to her stomach. It had been a long time relatively speaking since mankind had been anything but the top of the food chain, and this state of things was abhorrent to her. So she made that her singular goal, restoring homo sapiens to biological supremacy, her birthright. And tonight was going to turn the tide. \n\nShe glared at the screen. Tactical deployments were underway. Tracking and prediction had been the hardest nut to crack. The navies with their sonars had been all but useless until a university team of seismologists camped out on an island in Indonesia had unlocked the secret that the sea people were burrowing under the continental shelf. That in turn had led to the mapping of their network of underground tunnels and traced them back into the abyssal plains at 4000-6000 meters depth where they originated. Or at least so went the theory. It takes more intensive engineering capacity to explore the deep places in the ocean than it takes to explore outer space.\n\nGiven that difficulty of probing let alone digging under the bottom of the abyssal plains, a habitat long thought devoid of most life, and combined with the fact that the area of this environment is a good two thirds of the total land area of Earth, it's not really surprising in retrospect that the Sea People had gone undetected for all of history. Venke wondered if the mysterious timing of their return after three thousand years would be equally unsurprising when looking back. Had someone asked her just a couple of weeks ago, she would not have used the conjunction *when* but rather *if* she would be looking back at this moment. But tonight she was full of confidence. Tonight they would receive the next raiding party with the full power of the joint militaries of the surface civilization, and show those crusty shitheads who was the dominant clade on this planet. \n\nA signal resonant with her sentiment comes through the line from a tactical commander on the ground.\n\n\"Hope you boys brought your garlic and lemons.

The sound roused him from a junkie's half-sleep, not rest so much as a waiting. The 'cycle's whine was replaced by the keening of his amphetamine hangover, the sound of straining metal or friction on glass forcing him from his rack. \n\nJimmy struggled to the bathroom, aiming his piss-stream in the general direction of the metal toilet and missing more than not. Not that it mattered; the nano-maids would suck it up, relieving it of the organics and solids, leaving mere water behind. His kidneys ached and his jaw felt like he had been struggling to chew vulcanized rubber all night. \n\nThe sound of his VA chattering from the bedroom, announcing an incoming message hurt physically, electronic talons wrenching him back into the world from the speed freak neon alley of his yesterday.\n\n\"Jesus Christ! Who the hell is it, what do they fucking want?\" Jimmy seethed, gripping the door jamb as much for orientation as balance.\n\n\"It is your contact, Mallory St. Vincent, asking for your door code. From her locator, she appears to be in the lobby,\" the overtly sultry, near-pornographic tones of his VA answered, too loud and too real, \"Shall I respond?\"\n\nJimmy's brain suddenly found the door to sobriety with celerity, his eyes darting from the mess of his bedside table replete with broken syn-caps and vodka miniatures, to the flat, gloss black rectangle leaning against the painted brick wall of his bedroom, taking it all in with the eyes of a forensic tech at a double murder. *All of this shit means something, a story I don't fucking want Miss St. Vincent to know, that's for sure* , Jimmy's thoughts managed, colliding though they were  like slapstick movie cops losing a suspect, to pull themselves together enough to respond:\n\n\"Fuck no, don't you dare let that woman in or I will reprogram you as a fucking automated doorbell.\" Jimmy threatened, sweeping the speed detritus into a drawer on his way to grab the Stallman-box from the floor and shove it with little ceremony down the gap between the wall and his piss-stained mattress.\n\n\"She has messaged again. Would you like the message now? She is very insistent. She is using the comment-thread font.\" the VA seduced. This new trend of using specific fonts for tone can be useful but only if you still read text instead of having your VA read to you. \n\n\"Fuck me!\" Jimmy ran his hands through his greasy curls, pivoting about on a heel to survey the room for more degenerate clues.\n\n\"Would you like me to begin a masturbation program, Jim? The chubby Japanese woman as last time?\" the VA beckoned.\n\n\"No, you fucking idiot, I meant that as an expression of doom! I don't think I could get it up right now if I took two X-ride pills and that coffee girl begged me to screw her.\" \n\n\"She is messaging again, Jim. She is rather angry from the tone. She is using a knife overlay on the text.\"\n\nJimmy gave one more cursory glance around the room, \"Tell her I just woke up - use the sorry-font - then give her the code.\"\n\n                                                      *******************************************\n\nThe hallway was poorly lit and damp but a world better than the seething city air of the entry. Mallory left her mask on just in case there was an air leak in the ancient walls of the building. The structure was one of those that managed to survive the Drone Conflict of '38 and was converted by the Housing Authority to a tenement. It was an ugly building, they all are, really, and made even more awful by its proximity to the elevated 109 expressway.\n\n*Pretty much what I imagined, if I am honest* , Mallory mused, sidestepping a sleeping derelict. The lights flickered a few times then settled down, dimmer by a fraction than before. *At least the miser software still works* , she thought, reaching the dented door of number 1306.\n\nAs she approached, a VA that sounded like a cross between a cam-girl advertisement and a Sino-soap actress cooed from a crackling, dented speaker that looked to have been shot, \"Please touch the ID pane for entry.\"\n\nThe door swung open to a dark hallway. As she steeped through, a light flickered on, revealing a foul kitchen to her right. She continued into a dingy, filthy room beyond, populated by sparse furniture and the tall, lean figure of The Rat. He looked nearly transparent as the prolonged drug abuse had made his skin sallow and gaunt and white as hospital walls. \n\n\"You took your time with the door code, asshole.\" Mallory jabbed, surveying the dismal flat.\n\n\"Why are you here, Miss? I can't believe you weren't snatched from the doorstep. Your, ah, kind doesn't come out this way very often.\" Jimmy stammered.\n\n\"You don't need to call me 'Miss', idiot. I had your penis in my mouth just three days ago. I think we may be past the point of ceremony, don't you?\" she replied, her sardonic, ruby-tattooed lips revealed as she removed her Safe-Mask.\n\nJimmy sighed and slumped against the wall. The amphetamine pull was strong, tugging at the edge of his mind, beckoning. He shook it off and straightened. \"I...yeah, I don't know what happened there. You had a few vodkas and some dab, I guess, so, you know, your, ah, secret is safe with me.\"\n\nMallory eyed him as one might examine a particularly stupid puppy urinating in its food dish. \"I don't have secrets, Jimmy. I don't care who knows what. Well, mostly. That's the insulation of a trust fund in action. It keeps me from having to acknowledge, well, *anything*. But I didn't come here to chat about blowjobs, I came here because I think you might be well suited for a job I need doing.\" She glanced at the bed but then thought better of sitting on it.\n\n\"I'm not looking for more work. The catering stuff gets me by...\" Jimmy shifted, feeling a tingle in the 'DO NOT TRUST' part of his drug-ravaged mind. At least his instincts weren't completely dependent. \n\n\"So you can live in a flat that smells of piss and death, where the neighbors take casual naps on the hallway floors? You are a real social climber, aren't you, Jimmy.\" Mallory's crooked smile made another satirical appearance.\n\n\"Look, I don't know why you think you have some errand that might interest me. I don't know you, you don't know me. In my experience, that makes me sort of disposable. I'm the plausible deniability in the equation. So take your lousy hundred credits and...\"\n\n\"Five thousand.\" Mallory interjected.\n\nJimmy felt his mouth go dry. \"Excuse me?\" His voice sounded tiny in his ears.\n\n\"Five-kay bitbills. Untraceable card. For max two hours work.\" her hand brushed an errant hair from her brow.\n\n\"Five thousand bits. What the fuck do I have to do for that? I'm not killing anyone. You can find a Morbury Avenue kid to do that shit.\" Jimmy felt slightly dizzy.\n\n\"If you are up for it, I just sent you a location,\" Mallory said flatly, her face looking looking down at her devvie (that was what the hip kids were calling it, if Jimmy's memory served). \"It is definitely illegal but low risk. And since you are the only person I sort-of know outside of my horribly upper-class social sphere *and* you look pretty sordid, you are all I have.\"\n\nJimmy fought to keep his voice from quivering, \"Fucking-hell, five gee. I guess I would be a fucking idiot if I didn't hear you out.\"\n\nMallory began fiddling with the straps on her Safe-Mask, \"Meet me at the location I sent tomorrow, three o'clock. And take a fucking shower before you go.\"\n\nMallory donned her 'mask and strode to the door. She glanced either direction down the hall and left. The door clicked shut behind her and Jimmy sat on the bed, head between his hands.\n\n\"Fuck.\"\n\nThe VA was blessedly silent.", "created_at": "2020-03-20 20:39:49.049296", "updated_at": "2020-03-20 20:48:57.397502", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1402, "wiki": false, "reads": 24, "score": 9.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4022, "user_id": 354, "topic_id": 1238, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Sarah was thinking about Danny and got very sad for reasons she couldn't understand.

That idiot Alex is at the gates.\"\n\"Which gates?\" he asked, his heart thumping. \n\"Palace, palace!\"\nHe didn't ask how she knew. She always knew. How was it that she could never foretell in ample time? Buckingham Palace was at least ten minutes away. \n\nHe hadn't had time to say goodbye to Rebecca. He had been about to fling himself down next to her on his blow up mattress but instead made a leap, hitting his shoulder on the way out. \n\"Shit!\" he cursed, getting to the elevator and pressing the button frantically. He took the stairs instead, skipping steps as he made his way, three flights down. The elevator was still creaking its way up. \n\nHe had no idea what Alex was up to. Charlotte Mansfield had explained nothing. She said leave and he had left. He assumed he would find out when he got there. Her urgent tone made his stomach churn. He had a bad feeling about this. To have Mansfield call, meant that there had been a serious plot twist. \n\nHe grabbed his bicycle from beneath the steps, pedalling hard towards the palace.\n\nAt the gates, Alex was speaking to a guard, shouting at him rather.", "created_at": "2020-07-12 18:08:55.600297", "updated_at": "2020-07-12 18:08:55.600297", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 268, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 8.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3959, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 1186, "post_number": 9, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2020-08-30 14:55:55.111739", "updated_at": "2020-09-07 20:03:15.400366", "deleted_at": "2020-09-08 20:10:06.638704", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1800, "user_id": 320, "topic_id": 882, "post_number": 1, "raw": "There is a way that unexamined views can only really be put on trial once a situation arises where they obviously, blatantly don't hold up to reality. And even then, only when exposed to those conditions for an extent of time. \n\nSo it is with the fact that I'm going to die. The unexamined view here is that I don't see my death as an actual event. It's been hidden from a deeper knowing, the kind of knowledge that resides in my bones. It's always just been a concept. A hypothetical. \n\nIt's funny to me how such insights eventually rise to the surface of my consciousness as I languish on this raft in the middle of the ocean. Death has come so very close. It's my constant companion. My only companion, besides the gallery of thoughts that rattle in my mind. \n\nIt's no surprise really that my own death had seemed a distant hypothesis, rather than the actual experience that it will be for me some day. It's quite obvious now why that would be after a closer examination. Our culture hides death away, makes it a special event, something tragic removed from daily life. Death is hidden away by hospitals and ritual. We are inundated with an understanding of death as a mostly abstract concept, warned about on safety labels or presented to us in tales of extraordinary heroism so far removed from actual life that they just become entertainments. All this is what lead me to believe, while not really knowing that I believe, that my own death is a distant thing. A statistic. \n\nLeading causes of death for my age group: unintentional injury. Malignant Neoplasms. Heart Disease. Suicide. Homicide. Our brains are engines anciently designed to make risk mitigation from the fuel of experience. We adapt to our environment, and we grasp instinctively at any risk factors around us. We can't help but do so. But with the lack of a hearty paleolithic diet of often traumatic and very real experiences of death, our brains make do by digesting the thin soup of words, images and concepts fed to us through stickers on window screens or news headlines or fictions of alien robot invasions. \n\nBut being stuck alone on a tiny piece of flotsam in the middle of a gigantic body of water that cares nothing for whether I live or die, the engine in my head gets something real to work with. I might make it back to land. Or I might very well die out here whenever the ocean decides that it's hurricane time, or that I'm not to have any more fish, or I any other unintentional injuries might occur or my heart stops or I decide to take death into my own hands. At least I don't need to worry about homicide. @SilverRose @disco4robot", "created_at": "2020-03-16 02:37:26.861205", "updated_at": "2020-06-07 22:11:08.942705", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 484, "wiki": false, "reads": 25, "score": 25.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [169], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1834, "user_id": 169, "topic_id": 859, "post_number": 7, "raw": "\"What do you mean that darkness is dead?\" Hakawati says finally. \"Darkness created death.

Dark and damp, in the outer walls of the building were alternate stairwells, which few dared to climb due to the lack of electricity and the way they crumbled underfoot.\n\nRising too far upwards through the university resulted in a similar gradient of decay. The upper floors were often abandoned and unelectrified, though the plumbing of the entire building was remarkably uniform.

We are still figuring out the details and that means we learn the hard way. Nearly six years in and all we have really managed to decide is that we are each other's core relationship. We've seen Nteba around at a few parties. I admit she is sexy. She balances on the edge of the gender binary. She is pretty and when she wears a dress, she pulls it off. But the night things were decided, she wore a leather jacket and her braids were neat long lines that looked like thick beads adorning her unblemished skin. \n\nI see that Eve likes her and it excites me. I even encourage them to go on a date. Eve is excited. She leaves the house early. Nteba has invited Eve to be her birthday fuck. I find it a bit off side, but I manage. When Eve leaves for the party, I buy myself a bag of weed and spend the day alone. \n\nI don't make plans with anyone. I get high and go to the mall, with music blaring in my ears and my stomach turning. I forgot what it was like to be alone and I realize this an hour in. \n\nBut I haven't smoked weed in ages and I'm fucking killing it alone. I have gone to the bank, did grocery shopping and when I bought myself a coffee I sat alone without lifting my phone. I forgot what it was like to think as a single entity walking around the world. I was enjoying it, but the day was still long. \n\nThat evening I took myself out. To the museum district. I shouldn't see people I know around here. There are lots of tourists and the bar has a band scheduled that evening. I'm early, obviously. I don't have much else to do. I parked my car in the underground parking and intend to fetch it in the morning.\n\nOutside the bar, my body has eased into an extravagant beanbag like it is a bath. The air is soft and the sun is setting. I can't see it, but I the sky changes colour. I smoke a joint and none of the waiters mind. Not because weed is legal, but because everyone smokes and there are no folk old enough to complain around. I drink a cup of filter coffee with Amarula. Amarula is a sweet and deadly milk-like alcohol.  I'm getting flashes at Eve laugh at something stupid Nteba says. The more I get jealous, the more I am determined not to be. The memory is vivid. I am alone. I am high. I am jealous. I am surviving. The sky is pretty and I am a fucking Queen. \n\nI flirt with all the waiters. I flirt with the strangers who smoke in close proximity. When the music starts and I begin drinking wine, my gaze flirts with every returned eyeline. It has been a long time since I was on a hunt. The band begins playing but it is a sit down and watch kinda party. I leave and the driver drops me outside a high end club where people get dirty. I chose it specifically because I am looking for a man. \n\nI've been with enough women to know the dance and I haven't really seduced a man (alone) since Mozambique.  \n\nI look good, I feel fucking good. I wear my body like it doesn't carry the extra weight. I can feel my body is older, the looks I get from men are different. The look I return is bolder. I even have lipstick on. The red sheer shirt moves about my shoulder's  -  an extension of my intent. . I offer cigarettes and accept drinks but I don't need to. There is no spend limit tonight.\n\nIt takes me a while to gain confidence. \n\nI dance. I dance because I dance easily. I dance in the center of the floor and my body obeys the beat.  I dance because I don't need to talk to anyone when I dance. I dance because I am busy checking out the players.  No one dances with me for a while. I see them look and I round my hip and swing my head in the opposite direction. The first guy to dance with me, I allow. \n\nHe isn't my type but I guess he must be confident. I have nothing better to do. I wonder what Eve is doing and if they are alone yet and if Nteba is playing really cool music from Kenya that impresses Eve. I dance with the skinny boy in front of me. He looks young and he is without charm.His approach is  more a hopeful gamble than a will to dominate.  I am graceful in the way I play with him, but I am not looking for a toy. \n\nI smoke outside. Another man approaches. He is a little older I can tell, smoother - not really.  He doesn't know how to hold a conversation and he looks like the type of guy that would cat call. I grin  as I tease him. This confuses him. He can't tell if I am flirting or insulting him. I keep one edge of my lip curled in a smile as I sip on whiskey and amuse myself with man number two. \n\nI am losing faith and I know that Eve is probably having sex right now and because I have seen her have sex with other people, I know that she is in her element and it is so gross to think about. I talk to a gay guy and we discuss leaving for the closest gay bar. Perhaps I can't help preferring women even if I try not to. \n\nBut then he walks in and he is perfect. \n\nHe is tall. He looks like he is in his early twenties and even though I am only in my late twenties and the gap is probably only a couple of years, I feel like an older woman approaching a big strong young man. \n\nHe has the greatest shoulders that I think could exist. His jacket is tight around them, and not because he bought his clothing a size small, but because those muscles would be visible in anything he wore. His jaw is square and his face is stern. His body is massive. God. \n \nI approach and stand directly in front of him. I look into his eyes, tilt my head and smiles.\n\n\"Do you want to go to my place?\"\n\nI am so fucking happy that I will not spend the night alone I think as we drive to his place. Eve is probably having the best sex of her life and  at least he is sexy and who knows I might even enjoy this. The conversation in the car is dull, and the drive doesn't build on the initial chemistry. I don't think he is that smart, but he seems sweet. I wasn't expecting that from a fuckboy.   \n\nI start imagining a future with this sweet muscle man that obviously fell for whatever act of Sex God I had going in the club. As I imagine Eve kissing Nteba's belly and lowering even further, I force myself into this pathetic fantasy of a consistent casual hook up with whatever his name is. \n\nWhen we reach his place, He has Big Brother Nigera playing and he tells me he is from the Congo, but I could tell from the jawline. We kiss and I don't care much for it. I am excited to see his penis. It is been a while. His body is everything I hoped it would be, but he has become a puppy and I have become a pillow princess and the sex lacked tension and I think about Eve and Nteba the entire time. Eventually he cums and because he is a sweetie, he touches me gently like a woman so that I can orgasm as well. \n\nAfter, he tells me that he was skinny and he has been training really hard, he also hints that he is attracted to me because I am light skinned with an afro. I realize that I have become a type and I don't like knowing it. He holds me really tight and I am really grateful because I fall asleep easily. \n\nThe next morning I leave as soon as I wake up. I can tell he wants to make coffee, but I want to get home and wait for Eve. I feel a bit skanky but also like a fucking queen. I decide I need to know what I want from sex with a man. I decide that my next hook up will be with someone who seduces me and I laugh at that unlikely situation.", "created_at": "2020-03-31 20:46:47.293135", "updated_at": "2020-04-01 07:50:16.047330", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1496, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 14.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1356, "user_id": 395, "topic_id": 734, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hey there,\n\nI just finished my application for the project.

As Mam stepped out her door to sweep she felt the surging atavism of bronzed bricks, of autumn coats receding. There was pleasant weather but the tourist crowds bothered her. Their house was meant to be a storefront, but they bought it without such intention. At the time her discussions with Pap was about how a house that faces the wind and the people was good for raising children. They grew to tolerate the noise, from the 5am clonks of the pastry shop to their left or from the late-night sorting sounds of the bookshop to their right. And as such, their children were suave people, more so than themselves. She had been confident in letting them leave the house and country, and she took special care to not know where they are precisely. As for Pap she knew that there was a lot of repressed anger between them, an emotion that was dexterous at getting lost within their love for each other. The children had left; they had ample time to air it out before they die.\n\nAt mornings they were all lemon tea and bitter drops. As she finished sweeping she stood and properly inhaled the streets and decided that she hated nothing more than this city. But the refuge is but a door away, and the time being 10 a.m., she knew to go in silently as to not disturb Pap\u2019s iteration of morning crosswords on the dinner table. But no longer after she locked the door the knockings began, crisp and precise, almost mathematical.\n\nShe opened the door without perturbation. They did not have a peephole.\n\n\u201cHello, I\u2019m Miss Canto Caverley. I\u2019m here on order of the City Council, just to ask you a few questions.\u201d She felt confusion as the young but conservatively dressed woman introduced herself. Never mind the trouble, Mam thought of the *ancien regime* and its hunting of many peoples, and its suffering incurred on the average citizen. Why should anyone want to revisit a time when it means so little to be human? To meet a living anachronism made her feel sick to the core. \n\n\u201cPlease come in. May I pour you a cup of tea?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no, that won\u2019t be necessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cI insist.\u201d Mam replied with dignity.\n\n\u201cOh, alright. Do you mind if I have a look around here?\u201d\n\nMam couldn\u2019t really say anything as the investigator began to leaf through their newspapers and cups. The tea grew cold and blurred as the woman combed through pots, pans and fresh vegetables. With such rigor! Is she from the *Gestapo* ? \u201cYour tea is getting cold, Miss Caverley.\u201d\n\nFor once the woman\u2019s attention was diverted onto herself, and Mam felt she committed a grand mistake. Miss Caverley towered over Mam easily, but the investigator chose to sit down instead and hold up the cup of tea. Mam watched the cup\u2019s deadened rim as it neared Caverley\u2019s mouth. Caverley did not drink it; she was doing it to be polite.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m not allowed to take it. Forgive me.\u201d \n\n\u201cI must have missed a text from the community center,\u201d Mam excused herself and broke a limping smile, \u201cbut I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re here. You see, me and their Pap, we don\u2019t do much in town. I don\u2019t know why anybody would have business with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t think so either. It seems quite a cozy place you two have here, despite, you know, all the crowds.\u201d Canto Caverley nodded as she reciprocated Mam\u2019s squeaking smile. There was a gap of misdirected anxiety, but Caverley resolved it without question. \u201cBut I had to come today.

JEREMY, WITH LOVE\n\n\"It's drastic, yes; why am I not feeling it, though? Everyone seems to be plagued by the mere notion of borders closing, of mobility being reduced -- nay, even restricted-- and of governmental officials (police and whatnot) swarming in the streets. All I can think of is how I spent almost two decades facing this looming horror from which everyone is suffering. Stateless; without any papers or anything to prove my existence, my life has been a series of anxious loops circling around aimlessly. \n\n\"Borders have always been closed; mobility was always restricted; police was always, always around the corner. I don't see the point of pointing this out, though. We live in the age of the offended -- what if a cyber tiger attacked me with their well-polished claws? 'You're not the only one feeling this one,' one of the flakier ones would say. Those damned airheads thinking they have a full grasp of what confinement really is.\n\n\"When I first told Santiago about my case (that's before we confessed our love to each other), Santiago contemplated my face before he made a knocking gesture on my forehead. 'Jeremy, you're stuck in your head,' he said. At first, I wanted to rearrange his facial features with the full force of my fist as I deemed it very inconsiderate. What did he know of confinement? What did he understand of being stuck? He'd been to the four corners of the world, whereas I, being paperless, only knew the roads of this country -- nothing beyond. I wish I could tell this to someone without being sprawled underneath the magnifying glass of judgement. \n\n\"I decided to stop smoking, yet the stress of the news constantly pestering my equilibrium is not helping. There is a myriad of things to worry about, so I make myself a peanut butter sandwich. As usual, I end up devouring the entire jar, one small spoon at a time. \n\n\"Santiago's calls are becoming less and less frequent. I understand his depression; I understand he needs me to be there for him. When we agreed to do long distance, there were a few ground rules we never deviated from -- one of them was to call at least once in the span of 24 hours. It's not like we had another choice. Long distance was the one and only answer -- back then, at least. He keeps on traveling; I keep on...

The word 'deceased' comes to mind -- a denizen that ceased to exist, a de-ceased. The West knows very well how to make death part of pop culture. No, that doesn't mean that my mother was correct in her thinking. It is ultimately true that we did consume a load of perturbing violence as teenagers and young adults. Yet what my mother missed is the idea that my generation cracked its own shell prematurely without the help of anyone, really; it exposed itself to life, thus uncovering its vunerable spot. One more thing, though: my generation is the one that's desperately hitting the brakes of a vehicle recklessly driven by those who think are older and thereby wiser. \n\n[quote=\"Bainsdrookel, post:1, topic:882\"]\nOur culture hides death away, makes it a special event, something tragic removed from daily life.\n[/quote]\n\nWhat were the Romantics thinking when they made suicide so damn appealing? Victorians weren't any better, either. I often thought of Sylvia Plath sticking her head in the over -- or maybe even Woolf and that famous river. Well, Woolf and I are not that different now; she had a river, I have an ocean underneath me. Fuck. I should have just done it. I can actually do it now. What is it? Roll over, force myself deeper into the ocean, swallow salt-water that will surely taste like fire -- I read that in a Dan Brown novel -- and then what? Survival instinct? Am I going to kick myself back to the surface? Death is not that easy to draw forth intentionally. That demands a certain amount of despair, not cowardice -- as everyone mistakenly assumes. \n\nDeath is still remote and virtual. Death is looking at hundreds of souls this very second; this very second, perhaps, is the second during which someone out there is seeing their entire life flash before their eyes; this very second someone out there is dying from childbirth, from a fall, from an accident. Nevertheless, just as well, someone is enjoying a cone of ice cream; someone is home, complaining; someone is laughing. And I, with all my ego, I am being toasted under the sun with nothing but an infinity of water. I'm the hands of a compass, and all around me is a confusing blend of directions.\n\nThe devil resides within us. It perches on the hearts of those who do not act on instinct all the time. Religion tells us that the devil tricks us into wrongdoing, lifting off the blame and the taint of sin that we, as conscious entities, are able to carry all the way up to our graves. Plainly said, it turns you into a sucker for penance\u2014albeit it is a relief. Indeed, it is a relief to know that evil does not sprout from you, that you are naturally immune to what is erroneous.

Every single day. And it takes time! Man does it take time. This kind of stunning isn\u2019t a walk in the park. My morning routine is lengthy, but I know I am worth it. And everyone around me can tell that I am as well. Beauty isn\u2019t skin deep. I\u2019m beautiful on the inside as well but if you could see my outside for just a moment you would know what I mean. You haven\u2019t seen stunning until you have seen me.\n\nI pass through the streets of Soho, I catch my reflection pristine shop front windows. The old glass is the best. It doesn\u2019t warp my magnificent outline like the pvc ones. But I don\u2019t stop and admire. That would be very crass. I am not crass. Crassness is often the prevail of the vulgar youth and, sometimes, the vulgar old who should know better. There are enough vulgar youth wandering here already. It is highly distasteful to my eye, not least because my eye is so perfectly beautiful but also because it insults my mind\u2019s intricate neural pathways. Honed into perfection from years of the right kind of activities. Reading Chaucer. Mediation facing north-north-east every morning at the right moment. Listening to Benedictine monks\u2019 chant (unfortunately recorded, not live, but we all have our foibles). Eating grains. The phrase \u2018my body is a temple\u2019 does come to mind but that would be the common man\u2019s description. My body *and* mind (for they are of one) is nothing short of perfection.\n\nEach morning after my Nespresso coffee with frothed unpasteurised cows milk (start with it at room temperature for best results, if it is too cold the froth can be more akin to huge frogs spawn than froth with smooth imperceptible bubbles), I begin my transformation. I start with my eyes. It\u2019s all in the eyes they say, but once you see me you\u2019ll realise that it is all in the everything. Around my eye is scarlet red. I have to build it up a little to get the depth, I used a base of purple with a sleight of pastel yellow on top. It has a shimmer finish for additional je ne c\u2019est quoi, but that only shows through properly if my diet and exercise regime are all in sync. Around the outer edges of the scarlet is a deep *deep* midnight blue that bleeds into more of a royal blue and ultimately to green. Every day I have to pause to marvel at how simply and perfectly and flawlessly the dark flows into the bright flows into the dark-grass green. I edge that with white. The contrast is really striking and unexpected. It is a sort of starched-white-regal-legal effect. A feel of somewhere between funded by the state (no offense Your Majesty, I have the utmost respect for you and all that you do, although let\u2019s leave out the elephants in the room \u2013 your children\u2019s penchant for divorce, the abdication of Harry ( *obviously* all Ms Markle\u2019s doing), Andrew\u2019s \u2018connections\u2019 \u2013 dear me, what a grey area, if only *they* could add a little colour, it might suit them) and / or courtroom feel. When I see my eyes are right I know the rest will follow. I wear a uniform of country tweed such that I could instantly and seamlessly blend into a meadow. It is not a cheap knit. Flecks of white on a maroon tinged rust give way to my waistcoat of auburn sand punctuated with black. If I catch the light in the right way you will see tinges of the softest blue-grey hue. It really is something and a total contrast with my eyes. It fits me perfectly, it is snug without being oppressive and the ebb and flow of it all perfectly aligned to my form.\n\nOnce I have it on there is only the tails to be worried with. I\u2019m not a penguin in white tie, searching for a ballroom at the Dorchester or the Savoy. No. I am much more modern and yet what I wear has gently evolved over the years to be nothing short of the exact way it should be. It is my armour and I wear it without hesitation. It draws in the ladies, which is its sole purpose. It can draw the men too, although I am not interested in them unless it is a territorial conversation in which I will inevitably gain the upper hand because I am better than them.\n\nI will never change what I wear. I will not alter to the world\u2019s tune. Fashion means nothing to me \u2013 I am perfect in my own fashion and I will not be shifted.\n\nI practise polygamy, only without any legal footing so, technically, it isn\u2019t quite polygamy. But I have four at the moment. They are all entranced by my beauty and they are plain by comparison. Lucky to have me. But I care for them and see that they are safe and loved. I must confess that, from time to time, any one of them may try to evade my advances when I seek them. But I keep myself so fit I always win them over in the end, whether willingly or by force I take what I need from them and they get from me what they deserve. I never let their moods ruffle my feathers, that wouldn\u2019t be right, they\u2019re only little women and I enjoy the challenge.\n\nSometimes I wonder if there is more to life?

I could feel it in my bones.\n\nI decided that this was going to be a test of my vanity. Pass by the mirror for at least three weeks without looking at it.

He would pop his head out of the single large window his studio apartment possessed, rest one leg on the sill -- making sure his head was not bent forward threateningly -- and listen to the nothingness of the night. All he saw were glowing lights dimming as they stretched before his eyes. The alleway he lived in, the one where he was raised by both his parents who were now deceased, retained a tenacious air of nothigness, of a lifelessness that dispelled and repelled anyone with a sense of status or decorum. Setrak, however, thought it was romantic. He often felt the awful presence of a shield, a sense of invisibility, befalling him every time he submerged himself into dense darkness. This alleyway was merely an unmarked vein in the city of Beirut, an unmarked city for most. \n\nThe night Setrak came to that hypothesis, that streetlamps had a life and a language of their own, was the same night he expected to have his brother over, Manuel. The name usually evoked in him a stinking aversion. The siblings never got along. It was not so much of a sibling rivarly that disassembled their supposedly predetermined affections as much as it was a dislike, stark and plain, to each other's way of living. Manuel, the eldest brother, did not think of it this way -- in fact, he did not think about their relationship at all, not in this depth. For him, Setrak was simply weird. No, he would not accept that his little brother was smarter, introverted, or soft-spoken. He would not accept that Setrak had a design and a perception of life much different than his -- much broader than his. He would not accept that Setrak, his very own Setrak, was gay. Manuel drudged on in denial of his brother's reality, keeping every potential box of validation unchecked. Their symbiosis was a complex and intricately staged to appease both parties. Manuel, the macho; Manuel, the alpha; Manuel, the tough, had no comprehension of Setrak's own sense of individuality. \n\nFor years, they bickered and were at each other's throats on many occasions. After their parents' death, Setrak promised himself he would only see his brother once every two months. Having compromised bits and pieces of himself during his youth for family's sake, Setrak felt no need to further that compromise after the eventual egress of his mother and father. He came out, he let everyone know. They (extended family and friends) threatened to desert him, to leave his side, to even call the police. He remained unfazed. He knew his rights; he had already been delving in queer activism for years at that point. No power could make him break his knee. Yet, however much he liked to think he had all the leverage he needed to live free, Setrak was dumbfounded when he realized that he could not go on without settling down his life-long dispute with his brother. He devised a planned to let himself break free. \n\nSetrak spent hours researching psychoanalytical methods to remedy his rage. Hours, days, months passed and Setrak made sure he left no stone unturned. Nevertheless, as it is with all these phantasmagoric stories, Setrak forgot to turn one more stone. It seemed ludicrous at first, but there it was. Setrak was not much of a believer -- his cynicism would not even allow him to fully believe in science. Yet this time, he had to try. He had to exhaust all of his resources to deal with the anger he had harboured against his brother. Yet he knew he would not win any of the arguments; he knew his brother had forgotten everything and that he is leading a life oblivious of the pain he had inflicted; he knew Manuel lived on with the narrowest worldview.

He sounded like he was reading words of the page he hadn't written himself in an attempt to participate in the masquerade that was the finite game dominating the room. The game of acting like you've got your shit together and know what you're talking about, while hiding the fact that *you don't know shit* and are, behind the mask, just a ignorant primate made to be afraid of the dark just like the rest of us.\n\n\"It used to be thought that a mysterious so-called 'Sea People' invaded the coastal cities of the late Bronze Age and laid waste to them. That explanation has long since fallen into disfavor, with modern theories of general systems collapse holding that societal declines in the face of complex challenges lead to a fragile social structure and eventual collapse. However, given the obvious present day evidence presented to us, we think that....\"\n\nHe fell silent for a moment, clearly uncomfortable in his own skin. He took a napkin from his pocket and wiped of sweat from his brow.\n\n\"We think that the Sea People theory is due for a review.... We think this may have happened before, possibly several times, but that the frequency is so low that the last one barely made it into the epoch of recorded history.\"\n\nA murmor went through the briefing room. It was occupied with the usual military rabble seated in uncomfortable folding chairs crammed into the space. Officers, mostly older white men, sat with brows furrowed and arms crossed. It was unclear to Venke whether their brows were furrowed in concentration or skepticism, and whether their arms were crossed in defiance or simply in an effort to make minimal body contact with each other. \n\nVenke felt a familiar anger well up in her, pondering the significance of the demographics in the room. She had held a life-long regard for evolution through natural selection as the central organizing principle that not just brings about all the wondrous forms of life about but also matches that life into ecosystems where energy is propagated with efficiency and effectiveness. From an evolutionary viewpoint it made perfect sense to her why this particular room was filled with the stern faces of a group of that certain demographic. \n\nWhile civilian institutions of democracy had long known and promoted the value of diversity and inclusion, the strength of the selection process at play in deciding who would get to be in a top level emergency briefing like this one left little space for the requisite diversity that this situation demanded. Selection had little to do with those men being the most qualified to make decisions, or their proven superiority in any other regard except one: the cultural factors of this setting had been set in place by old white men, and so it was old white men who were best adapted to this environment. They would be the ones who could get ahead and call the shots mostly because of their subtle advantages in an ecosystem that favored uniformity of thought and action. It had long been known by the Navy that women in fact made much better submariners than men, but fat chance of that ever becoming policy, given that the policy was written by these old grumps.\n\nAnd now that one-track system was showing its fragility in the face of a rapidly changing wartime ecology. Maybe there was something to be said for the theory general systems collapse as it applies to the Bronze Age Collapse. An army has uniforms and homogenous hierarchies in place because it makes it possible to wrap your too-small-for-comfort primate nervous system around it. But what happens you have an oversimplified control system in place for the sake of being able to wrap your head around it? And especially, what happens when the parameters of the ecosystem changes? How were these uniformed male primates equipped to handle the first adversary in over 3000 years who wasn't also a group of uniformed male primates? How long before the masquerade of knowing comes to an end? \n\nShe focused on her breathing, calming down. This is not a problem to be dealt with inside established boundaries of thinking, even though she considered her view more relevant than the unexamined ones in the room. There was in her mind only one principle that would make sense of this situation. Last night after the autopsy she had picked off her shelf the book that many years earlier she had named as her own personal bible, *Darwin's Dangerous Idea*, written by another old white man, about an even older white man, one of the greatest. She had found the passage she had returned to time and again.\n\n>If I were to give an award for the single best idea anyone has ever had, I'd give it to Darwin, ahead of Newton and Einstein and everyone else. In a single stroke, the idea of evolution by natural selection unifies the realm of life, meaning, and purpose with the realm of space and time, cause and effect, mechanism and physical law. But it is not just a wonderful scientific idea. It is a dangerous idea. My admiration for Darwin's magnificent idea is unbounded, but I, too, cherish many of the ideas and ideals that it  *seems*  to challenge, and want to protect them. \u2026 The only good way to do this\u2014the only way that has a chance in the long run\u2014is to cut through the smokescreens and look at the idea as unflinchingly, as dispassionately, as possible.\n\nShe could find determination if not solace in that intellectual call to arms. A lot of her more 'spiritual' friends from academia viewed evolution as this beautiful process of unfolding lotus flower petals. But that process wasn't a beautiful process if you were to look into the details. In the details were lamprey needle teeth and the smell of rotten flesh and disease, and sweaty old dinosaurs sitting with their arms crossed waiting for her to come up to the front of the room to make sense of all this to them so *they* could decide what was the best course of action. As meanwhile the asteroid grew bigger on the night sky.\n\nBut there was beauty even in that ugliness. A hidden geometry that she could barely perceive the outlines of. \n\n*The lotus flower only blooms in the murkiest of waters.*\n\n\"Dr. Venke Spielbaum will now present to us her findings from the vivisection she and her team performed on the specimen we captured on June 12th.

Half a dozen of brutalist buildings were scattered among the trees around the slopes. Massive slabs of concrete, all straight lines and harsh angles, interrupting the soft curves of the hill and the vegetation. The main building, a Victorian manor, crowned the summit. It still retained its glory. Soaring chimneys, a tower, latticed windows.\n\nAs the taxi drew closer up the road towards the manor, Victor Crenshaw looked out the side window. Trees crowded close to the road, so he only got brief glimpses of the concrete buildings. He saw a few orderlies in white, and perhaps a patient or two moving among the trees. A flock of crows took flight from a large oak, spiralling away into the sky.\n\nA man was waiting on the steps leading up to the manor. Victor got out, paid the driver, and walked up to the building. The man, tall and thin, wearing a white coat and round spectacles, walked down to meet him.\n\n\"Victor Crenshaw, I presume,\" he said, extending his hand.\n\"Yes,\" Victor said, shaking the man's hand. \"You are Doctor Klein? We spoke on the phone.\"\n\"I am,\" Klein said, smiling. \"Welcome to Ashbury.\"\n\nThey walked up the stairs side by side. Klein smelled faintly of disinfectant and something else, something sweet and sharp. His back was ramrod straight, and he carried his 65 years with grace. Victor had done plenty of research before the visit. Klein was born in America to German parents, something that might have been to his detriment if it were not for the fact that he had trained combat medics for the Army and Navy in preparation for the invasion of Normandie. He had quite a reputation, Doctor Joseph Klein.\n\n\"There are rooms for you on the second floor,\" Klein said as he pushed the door open. \"I thought we might have dinner tonight and discuss how you wish to proceed.\"\n\"I would prefer to begin at once,\" Victor said. \"Time is a factor, and it took long enough for me to gain access here.\"\n\nKlein turned to him. They were in the lobby, a large space with curving staircases up both walls. Large oil paintings of the Ashbury family, patrons of this and many other institutions across Maine and Massachusetts hung on the walls.\n\n\"I assure you, Mister Crenshaw,\" Klein said, \"we had nothing to do with those delays. It was only three days ago that I learned of your visit here.\"\n\"Yes, you said as much over the phone,\" Victor said. \"I would like to begin at once.\"\n\"Of course. Let me walk you to your room.\"\n\nVictor's rooms had a large balcony with an ocean view. They were far more luxurious and much larger than his own apartment back in New York. Ashbury money at work. Klein made small talk while Victor unpacked. Notebook in hand, he followed Klein downstairs and out, into the trees, down a path towards building B.

A dear friend had a wonderful party and concert to celebrate the release of his first album. The music was spectacular, the atmosphere bright and ebullient. It would be difficult, one imagines, to have a bad time in such a circumstance.\n \nOne would be imagining incorrectly, however. In the midst of the festivities, a drunken, middle-aged fool became belligerent and behaved like an adolescent, a look-at-me sort of tantrum usually reserved for the under 25 set. It was absolutely childish. I am not really concerned with this damaged person and their foibles, however, as they are just an illustration, a timely metaphor, of emotional need misplaced, or perhaps a crying out for something it can scarcely identify.\n \nMy focus of late has been the Philosophy of The Minimum, both in my reading and contemplation. Not exactly the same thing as the popular Mrs. Kondo, nor the myriad \u201cself-help\u201d books about downsizing one\u2019s life. My reflection has been about the minimum we humans require emotionally. \n\nThe fog of dreams leaves imprints on the mind, like the dent left by my head in the pillow. Vague, emotionally-charged events tumble past, some pleasant, some not, a vast tapestry without context that represents, I theorize, the unresolved emotions from the day. Some may even represent events or emotional voids years old. \n\nThe subconscious filters millions of tiny pieces of information collected by the senses, most of which it can delete, like the color of the sixteenth car that passed you that day, or the number of geese flying overhead. These are unimportant. Sometimes, however, there are emotional conflicts deemed unnecessary at the moment, but that will need to be addressed later. \n\nEmotions come from an ancient part of the brain, the base bits called the limbic region. This area records situations that gave either positive or negative results, a sort of repository for basic learning. It hurt and scared us when we placed our hand on a hot surface, so we will always be cautious to test hot things before handling them. This person is being aggressive, I should avoid them because it makes me anxious or angry. I am hungry so I must eat, else I will become ill.\n\nSo some situations get dealt with rapidly, in the moment. Others are left to roam the halls of the subconscious, to be dealt with later. But which ones? How are they dealt with? Who deals with them? Is it me? What does \u201cme\u201d mean? This is where the real mystery of consciousness lies.\n\nIt seems that those situations we haven\u2019t the time or inclination to deal with bounce around in our heads looking for some kind of resolution.

Still, he surveyed his kitchen with a clearer head, and decided that the state of affairs just couldn't be allowed to continue.\n\n\"Alright!\" Jeff yelled in big booming voice that he'd picked up that one unfortunate summer he worked as a camp instructor, \"Everyone out! Out the back door and for fuck's sake, don't touch anything!\"\n\nNo one moved at first, but when Jeff pointed at the door with an imperious finger, Gak snapped to attention and guided (shoved) the motley lot out. His backyard was a sad square of hard dirt, a single bush struggling in the corner, but it had a hose connected to the outside tap, and that was all he really needed. Sophy\u00e1 took one look at the green hose that Jeff had coiled around his hand like a snake, turned on her heel, and stomped back into the house. Immediately, Gak began to follow, but Jeff held out a palm to stop him.\n\n\"Girls get testy when they're preening,\" Jeff whispered, conspiratorial. He knew Sophy\u00e1 would be furious if she heard him saying something puerile but considering Gak had just flung his friend clear off her feet, he'd say whatever it took to separate them. \"Here, take the hose.\"\n\nThe two flinched as they were blasted with cold water, but held their arms out in acquiense. One even opened their mouth to gulp the clean water down eagerly. Gak watched with obvious approval, occasionally directing the sodden two to spin in slow circles, ensuring that they were properly clean. When the deed was done, Gak snapped their fingers and at once, the water evaporated, leaving the two perfectly dry. \n\n\"Couldn't you have done that to all the muck and dirt?\" Jeff demanded. His water bill was already a horror and he only took short showers once a day.\n\n\"Water is pure,\" Gak replied, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. \"The muck, as you call it, was not.\"\n\n\"Right on.\" Some issues, Jeff really didn't feel like questioning right now. He felt the answers would be beyond his vaguely spinning head. He focused on the two\u2026 children. Huh. Now that the grime was gone, it was clear from the baby fat on their cheeks and their wide, bewildered eyes that they were much younger than expected. God, did that make Jeff a kidnapper? He turned his back on that issue too. \"So, about Sophy\u00e1\u2014\" \n\n\"She reeked of swamp daemon!\" Gak clenched their fist in obvious effort to restrain their temper. \"She is one of the wretched, and must be disposed of immediately.\"\n\n\"How about now?\" came a voice behind them.

Or nest.\n[/quote]\n\nHis bearing is what caught her attention, ever so briefly. How confident his stride was as he walked towards her and her tower, back straight, chin lofty--yet as they locked eyes, there was the slightest pause of hesitation. The newness of the light in his eyes made her own eyes seem dull in comparison, and she looked away.\n\nDid he yet know? The way the tower consumed its climbers. The elements would grow harsher the higher he climbed. As the air grew thinner, his mouth would stretch and gape to suck in increasingly desperate breaths. To buffer against the howling, tearing wind, his hide would grow tough, and against the cold, thick turfs of hair would sprout. Thick callouses would appear first on his fingertips, the pads beneath his knuckles, the heels of his palms, until all of his hands were gloved in hardened hide. His arms would lengthen with each desperate reach of a new hand hold, a higher height. There would be no more space for hesitation, only blind determination, as he ascended inch by torturous inch. And then, inevitably, a stone would crumble or the tower would shudder, and--he would fall.\n\nShe remembered the first time she'd fallen from the tower, the plummet that had ripped the breath from her lungs, great crunch of her body against the yellow-gold sand. By then her hair had been a helmet of tangled hair so thick that it had protected her head from cracking like an egg. She lay in the sand, too broken to even whimper her devastation, until a fellow fallen had dragged her into a nearby shelter. It took her long weeks to heal. The shock of standing tall and straight so overwhelming after weeks of climbing that instinctively she curled back into herself, her longer limbs dangling in front of her to resemble primates of the past.\n\nBy her--fifth fall? Tenth? Eightieth? It was impossible to tell, with how the tower blocked the sun and stole time away. It didn't matter anyway, what number it took for her spirit to break. And it didn't matter anyway, that her spirit broke, for the tower still sang to her and chained her to its base with the murmur of power, the whispers of paradise.

See\u2014\" Fabian pulled out the eye and at once the packet of incense on the nearest shelf popped and started to smoke. He hastened to continue: \"Haha, eyeball, see, I saw Jeffers here in a shining future, waving a big ol' shining stick and I thought it was the stick you so graciously, wonderfully, gave to me for the mirrors that I spent all afternoon setting up for\u2014\"\n\nUli looked up from smothering the tiny fire with a rag to glare at him. \n\n\u201cAnyway, what\u2019s with the tofu, Ulz?\u201d Fabian asked, and then promptly stuck his finger into it. \u201cOh *gnarly*, kinda feels like the swamp demon brains.\u201d\n\n\"It's from my first customer! There was a fish in it.\" Sharp like a knife, Uli slapped his hand away from its trajectory of finger to his mouth. \u201cMight have fish poop in it.\"\n\n\u201cOh, was it a live fish? Where\u2019s it now?\u201d Fabian nodded with understanding as Uli tapped her temple. \u201cRight, tofu medium and brain medium. Same texture.\"\n\nUli finger-gunned him. \"Y'know, I'd been wondering about that! Makes sense!\" \n\nAnd while they\u2019d been having their little catch up, it seemed that the party had come to a decision. When Sophy\u00e1 nudged Jeff, he stumbled forward and blurted out, \u201cWe need directions to the golden apple!\u201d\n\n\"Holy grail of legend, seed of discord, beholder of ultimate beauty?\" asked Uli as she pulled out a thick ring folder and thumbed through a thick wad of ancient parchment she'd hole-punched and kept organiser with flimsy plastic dividers. To be quite honest, she was trying to buy time. She'd been slow to notice but there was a deep growling from somewhere within her shop, slowly increasing in volume with each passing second, dips and hitches beginning to quicken. And then there was a faint groan in the universe, as though it was a sofa that someone had just sunk down on, that Uli knew to be the L\u00f3ng, her dragon, uncoiling. Her head throbbed. Her ears itched. The humming, the groaning, the growling, \n\nAnd then, clear as day,\n\n*PEACH.*\n\nUli's mind raced. She would know that voice anywhere; though she'd never heard it before, she'd spent years dreaming of it. She heard, she obeyed, she asked, \u201cDoes it have to be an apple?\u201d Uli's mind went a mile a minute, tires leaving scorch marks. Many people mistook what they wanted for what they needed and they paid dearly in turn for what they didn't mean to buy, which never bode well for customer satisfaction but worked very well to her advantage. She asked slowly, as though in earnest deliberation,  \u201cHow do you know it\u2019s an apple?\u201d\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Jeff, furrow between his brows.\n\nUli leaned forward with a knowing smile. \u201cLanguage does so complicate matters when we go gallivanting off based on old scripture and legend. Did you know? The Chinese word \u8acb translates to green in English, but can also refer to certain shades of blue and yellow. Fascinating how that works, eh?\u201d\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Sophy\u00e1 repeated and coming from her, it sharpened to a frightful point. The steel in her gaze, Uli noted, is marvelous. Perhaps Fabe gave her rapier to the wrong party member.\n\n\u201cYou are looking for a round, reddish fruit that glows golden with hidden power, do you not? I know of this legend of yours, but in ours, it isn't an apple. It's a peach. They could be one and the same.\u201d\n\nGak\u2019s lip curled with dissatisfaction but they did admit, \u201cI have heard of such stories from our eastern brethren but because the beliefs and rituals that invoke us onto the material plane are different, we do not know much of each other\u2019s existence.\u201d\n\nUli beamed at him, her best customer service smile. \"Ours are peaches of immortality, grown in the Goddess of Mercy's garden. Imagine the rows and rows of fruit-laden trees! All ripe for picking! If they're good enough for Sun Wukong, it\u2019d be good enough for you.\u201d\n\nGak swept his gaze over the various magical knick knacks around the room, then pinned her with a stare. \"And you know where the peach is?\"\n\n\"I have\u2026 this!\" From the safe beneath the counter, Uli pulled out a small chest carved from rich mahogany and gently undos the silver clasps. From inside, she carefully plucked out from its silk cushion, a lighter in which there bobs a single coarse hair. The flame flared small at first, and then twitched, twisted, and burst into a long thin stream of fire towards the back of the shop. \"The hair of Sun Wukong plucked before he stole his first peach holds all of his greed, all of his cravings. It'll lead you towards the garden.\"\n\nThe party oohed and ahhed appreciatively, except Gak who sniffed and prodded it with a delicate claw. \"So... a magical dowsing rod,\" \n\nJeff groaned. \"It's the closest lead we've got so far. Maybe\u2014\" \n\n\"Make up your mind already!!\" cried Uli. She gestured with a huff to the slowly darkening shop. The sun is setting. \"Well?!\"\n\n\"Alright, alright!\" Jeff took a deep breath. \"We'll take it!\"\n\n\"Good! And your payment!\" Uli jabbed a finger at Gak, who suffered it because Jeff shot him a warning look. \"I shall take the first time you discovered the simple joys of fresh cut fruit, your first taste of pure bliss.\"\n\nAnd out came a great trout, writhing in the air between them. Its mouth gaped and gasped. As Uli wrestled it into her arms, the rainbow sheen of its scale sparkled with unearthly light. Struggling to keep hold of the trout, Uli nudged the lighter towards Jeff, who scooped it up with glee.\n\n\u201cThis is just a loan, however. A hair from Sun Wukong is worth more than you know, so you have to return it! Pay me with a fish and a promise!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will do our best to return it,\u201d Jeff agreed easily.\n\n\u201cBest you do that! My great nai nai\u2019s charmed it to ka-boom if it\u2019s away from my blood for too long. It\u2019ll burn you to grilled fish.\u201d And now! The time to strike! \"Hell, bring a peach back to me too!\"\n\n\"Will do!\" Jeff gave a cheerful thumbs up!, and when Uli, giggling as she fist-bumped his hand, offered her pinky with a casual flippancy, he hooked it with his own in a pinky promise.\n\nBoth Gak and Sophy\u00e1 stiffened at once, but it was too late! The deal was done and sealed. Uli began politely hustling them towards the door, which the trout thrashing in her arms helped greatly with. Dodging its flailing tail, the party hurried to the exit.\n\n\u201cFabian!\u201d Uli called, and when the man in question turned, lazy smile, sharp-eyed, she grinned back. \u201cRemember! That the peaches made a monster out of a monkey.\u201d\n\nWithout missing a beat, Fabian called back, \u201cAnd what are we humans but monkeys with a god complex?\u201d\n\nAs the door swung shut behind them, Uli laughed, high and delighted. With a little whoop, she spun on her heel and rushed into the backroom, falling to her knees on the couch perched against the aquarium. Her dragon was coiled up again, but as her nose touched the glass, it let out a sigh that shuddered out from its long slender neck.\n\nPressure in her skull like the babel fish gnawing and gurgling and then,\n\n*SERVE ME.*\n\nScrambling to stand on the couch, she held the trout up high above her head to let it slip into the water. It spasmed in the water, and then shuddered, and then swam in short jerky spurts towards the dragon, who opened its lazy eye, and then let out another breath, this time wordless and content. As though dismissed, the trout jerked as though escaping a trance and then zipped away to the other side of the aquarium.\n\n\"You liked that,\" she cooed, pleased. \"Today was such a wonderful day!

I was a vegetarian at the time. I meditated religiously. I did my daily ritual. Plus group meditation. I volunteered at an NGO. I hadn\u2019t smoked weed in a month.\n\nThe course opened with, \u201cThrough your mind in the bin, only once it was empty can it be filled.

We took turns. It didn\u2019t smell nice.\n\nIt was late. I hadn\u2019t slept, this is normal during psychosis.A Muslim woman shared her KFC with me one night.  I didn\u2019t eat meat at the time, but savoured her kindness. I ate that battery chicken like it was communion. I think that\u2019s how people in the past ate meat. Like it was holy.\n\nEventually I was put in a ward. They cramped extra beds into the small room and a security guard watched over us. I scared her with accusations of maltreatment and overcrowding and threatened to report her to the authorities.\n\nAll of us were put into the Emergency room.\n\nThe friendship I make in the cuckoo nest always seem the most sincere. We look after each other in our most vulnerable state. But I forget their names.\n\nOne girl there longed to leave the psychiatric ward of the hospital and be taken to the mental institution. She had been before. You get breaks to smoke. Which is great. She lost her child and hears voices telling her to kill herself. She wants help.\n\nAnother girl, both desperate and mad, combed her hair with the toilet brush because it was unruly.  She explained that Lil Bow Wow was her boyfriend. We had a very practical conversation of how she could get hold of him on the internet.\n\nMed Students in the emergency ward were belittling. Doctors brushed us off. They needed us to be taken to the psych ward just as much as we did.\n\nThere, the psychiatrists were cold. I don\u2019t blame them. My stint into the ether, is their bread and butter. I stared at them as their wrote, measuring me against their textbooks. I wondered if we served their intellectual need to understand their own minds or to ease the emotional turmoil that we projected. I didn\u2019t know if they were angels, hardened at the front line or self-pitying demons searching for a sign of redemption.\n\nIt was a mixed ward. Which was scary at night. Again in the ward, I had a chair for a bed. The toilets didn\u2019t have doors. But we could have visitors. \n\nI got treats. Colouring-in books and sweets. I shared it. I gave my shoes away to someone that didn\u2019t have.. I would do this every time I was institutionalized. A common act of crazy.\n\nMy mother with her own set of emotional ills, was distant. I wanted her affection. I refused to ever leave my prison unless I got it. Eventually I did. Which I think forced me into her heart in a way that hurt her, and didn\u2019t allow me to stay there for long.\n\nOne of the guys was on a hunger strike. He wanted to go to mental institution. No one had been sent since I got there. Another time, when I was admitted into psych ward at another hospital, Groote Schuur we were shipped off every 3 days. I don\u2019t know if this is because things had been improved in a year since I was first institutionalized or if it was because of the difference in hospitals. Groote Schuur was a much easier hell to be in.\n\nEventually they admitted him. I, now with my mother cracked and enough meds in me to realize how shit things were around me; told the nurse-mother- who was a nun, that I had tried out drugs and would never do it again and that I was so sorry. I was lying for the first time since being there.\n\nShe looked at me with kindness and discharged me.\n\nA few months later, I was in Long Street, a trendy street in the middle of the Cape Colony. I was well dressed, smoking a cigarette on the road with a cool friend of mine and when homeless guy selling weed, called me by name. It was him.The hunger strike dude.  He was happy to see me.

Luckily, the creature had flung her close to the entranceway of one of the many underground subway stations that had been constructed and left abandoned for close to a century. Not many people knew about them. Her curiosity usually led her to explore uncharted pathways and unknown to her cool friends, she was a history buff. She escaped down the hole and had stayed there for about ten minutes until she heard silence. \n\nShe had chosen to walk through the alley that morning on her way to Jeff because she had wanted to explore the station. She had dressed in her elder brother's smelly hoodie which was too large for her and oversized pants, so as to appear as a person of non-interest to potential muggers. Evidently this had had the opposite effect on the fae who had sensed something threatening. Stale sweat and cologne trapped in the hoodie, smelled like a swamp deamon. \n\n\"Begone you evil swamp daemon\" Gak had cried as she flung Sophy\u00e1 away from the two sleeping street-dwellers. Sophy\u00e1 had been taken by surprise, wondering why leaving cupcakes for the homeless was such a crime.

No, definitely not a hangover hallucination.  \n\nSophy\u00e1 groaned, not from pain, but from the nausea that had begun to rise, the one associated with the brain finally realizing the realness of a situation. \nThis wasn't a fae from the Enid Blyton books she had read in her childhood.

Nails were neat. A single silver ring on her right pinkie. There was a low murmur of conversations around them from the people sitting at nineteen other tables. Two women with clipboards walked around the room, like chaperones.\n\n\"You probably started with some bad office coffee or something, right?\" she said. \"You don't know what you're missing.\"\n\nGary tried a smile. He knew his wasn't as nice as hers, but it wasn't bad. He had practiced a lot before coming here.\n\n\"Maybe you could show me some day,\" he said. Though he didn't really. He said it in his head. Saw himself ask the question, saw her smile, say Sure, taking his hand, leading him out of the restaurant, around the corner, to the coffee shop where they had coffee that tasted like sunshine, and then up two flight of stairs to her charming eclectic apartment where they had sex and drank coffee and laughed and kissed and watched stupid movies and the reticle centered over the building and the bomb fell and the building disappeared in a cloud of flame and dust and the officer said good kill, good kill, and Esther looked at him quizzically from across the table.\n\n\"Are you ok?\" she said.\n\"Yes, ok, yes,\" Gary replied.

His hand wanted to shake, but he made sure it didn't.\n\n\"So what do you do?\" she asked, taking a sip from a glass of white wine.\n\"I am a pilot, kind of,\" Gary replied.\n\nShe looked surprised, almost comically so.

Being ripped apart in whatever sense, whether death or anything up to it, would probably be a colourful experience.\n\nHer flushed cheeks, her block print skirt with some kind of necklace spaghetti going on, she smelt good too.

She paused long enough to gather her thoughts and look away from Gary for a moment and wonder what in hell she was going to say next. She looked up in that moment and saw the funky lighting of a daggy bar trying to be something it wasn't. Large, round coppper coloured lampshades set over those 'cool' old skool light bulbs that are oversize and you can see the filament running through in a sort of electrical storm squiggle and hanging from a cable so long that it means the ceiling is about a mile away. Not that Esther didn't like them but they did tend to be inefficient in almost every way and let's not get started on the cavernous spare space above their heads. Another inefficiency. Esther was an efficiency kind of girl. These things irked her.\nShe was also so very nervous. It was Azelia who had talked her into this (and given her a \"confidence booster\" before they left her apartment, Esther had not previously been acquainted with the concept of a double shot of absinthe as something to inspire the easy confidence and sophistication that might be sought after in a potential second date). \n\nBe bold! Be strong! (she thought). Then she thought that if she ever said that out loud she would be immediately spotted for the rando who had a misspent summer holiday youth at christian camp, clapping and singing and generally being wholesome regardless of belief. \n\nShe caught his soaking up the enormity of her necklace. Azelia had insisted she *layer* several necklaces on top of each other. She felt like a walking gansta in neat leather booted heels who forgot to sling their denim pants halfway down their legs to reveal some grotesquely logo-ed underwear. Not her look as such but a conversation point, Azelia had drilled into her the importance of conversation. \"Conversation. Conversation. Conversation\" she had said, and \"It isn't an organic way to meet people so you need to chat enough to see if you like them. Don't clam up and don't mind what you chat about, it don't matter!\" This one is for Azelia then!\n\nEsther cocked her head down and to the right to intercept Gary's eyes. \"My friend, she *styled* this pharaoh's effort around my neck. I've gotta tell you that it is not my normal gig but then this....\" she gestured around the room, \"isn't my normal gig either.\"\n\nGary looked at Esther, momentarily embarrassed at having both stared too long and been caught doing it. \"Yeah, it's kind of a spaghetti right?\" followed immediately with an apologetic-foot-in-mouth \"A very pretty spaghetti!\" This time he looked at her straight, he had the mildest undertones of a clown-fish swimming at the same depth of a whale. \n\nEsther took pity. She giggled and looked down at the chaos of chains and pendants hanging between her boobs. \"You're right Gary, what was I thinking, it is ridiculous!\"\n\nThey both laughed.

Goldie was, henceforth, to wear the wig under the pretext that it magically grew back; she was to cast the spell of forgetfulness (bottled nicely in sand from the dead sea) on her husband; and she was to have a baby. \n\nGoldie first protested, relating how she had been trying to keep the truth of who she was away from Rump by purposefully not bearing a child.

Intrigued, she purchased an e-book version of the book and later found out that it had little to do with demonology as a field of study.

We are all fed with how it is supposed to be from Hollywood or from boxing. Throw punches, back off, more punches, block, block and punch. MMA changed that some but it is still stylised, still with many formal rules. \n\nThe traditional rules of a Holmgaang are simple. The one who stands over the unmoving body(alive or dead) of the other was right. Or, back in the day. you could also win by throwing your opponent of the holm you were fighting on. if they could swim, or the water surrounding the holm wasn't particularly deep, both of you got to go home.\n\nModern times have made it's mark on these rules. While you can't take away all the risk of the killing, today they are fought without weapons and only in wolf-shape with others of the people. it mitigates some of the risk at least.

Not that he had held back, a fight is a fight and this one had even been sanctioned. But still. He bent down to look over the nastier of the wounds. Winced as the wounds on his right leg flared to life by the motion. The man called Richard would probably not bleed out from that gash in the shoulder but it would leave a nasty scar though. Best call it in anyway. Adam found Richards phone in the pack of clothes set to the side of the fighting space, ICE - Michael, followed by a phone number. Adam called it and limped to his pack for his first aid kit.\n\n---\n\nRichard test-lunged for Adam. Richards right hand claws raked the air where Adams chest had been scant moments earlier. Adam had stepped, snake swift, to the side and had reached his hand to grab Richards exposed arm. Richard pushed himself forward, out of reach for Adams claws. Adam was fucking fast. \n\nRichard caught himself on a tree to stop himself from barrelling. Turned around just in time to get Adams shoulder in the midriff as the other man had sprinted in behind him and made a low lunge. Richard was thrown against the tree and the air was forced out of his lungs by the impact. His mind was overwhelmed by the gasping terror for a moment. Then Richard tried clawing Adams back which turned out largely ineffective as he couldn't put much mass behind the move. Instead, knee up into Adam's chest. Solid connect. Adam pushed himself back with the grace of one who were used to fighting in the form. Both tock stock for a second. No true damage had yet been done.\n\nThen both moved towards each other, Richard managed to get a deep cutting claw swipe in on Adams thigh. A wincing wound but doing little real harm. Too late did he realise his mistake as the world tumbled to the side as Adams hand connected, hard, with the side of Richard's head. Once on the ground the fight turned nasty. They scratched and bit and tore. Adam managed to rip Richards shoulder deep and then Richard knew, fucking knew the fight was lost, but kept at it out of adrenaline and fury for some more moments. Then his head started growing light and Adam managed to hit him two times in the head. And the world came to a stop.\n\n---\n\n\"He'll live\" Adam said tiredly into the phone, \"He almost would have had me too... So... I'm guessing I'm free to go?\" \nThe tight voiced man on the other side of the phone says \"Yes.\"\n\"Good.

She was funny too.\n\nMy wife always had a story for every situation, the stories were generally not directly linked or relevant to the situation. But that was why we loved her. She told me about how she once slipped her hand into that of a stranger on a London street. They had held it out for their girlfriend in between which my wife had inadvertently stepped on the busy street. She had done it with permission from the girlfriend via a smile and a wink. They walked a block before he realised he was holding the hand of a person he didn't know and they all ended up having a drink in the John Snow together in Soho.\n\nMy wife always had a story for every situation, the stories were generally not directly linked or relevant to the situation. But that was why we loved her. She told me once how she had met a person on a train from Montreal and chatted with them for two hours straight about current affairs in America and what could be done to bridge the gaps in education, economic standing and why the rest of the world has the perception of the country that it does. They shared a bar of chocolate. That person went on to become a world leader who she would never name but would always smile at the memory and the thought that a piece of her mind was, for a brief couple of hours, an element of what was orbiting their conscious.\n\nMy wife always had a story for every situation, the stories were generally not directly linked or relevant to the situation. But that was why we loved her. But, towards the end, I'm sure the medication started to ebb into and adle her mind like milk curdles. Coagulating and confusing. Liquid lumps obscuring the view of her own neural pathways in the ever-increasing cruelty of the disease that was taking hold of her and the drugs that attempted to lessen its blow. Her stories continued but became punctuated by a level of disbelief that made them become unbelievable. But still I listened. The story telling was written into her DNA and to deny her that pleasure would be to take away what defined her.  By the end I never knew what was truth and what was vivid, passionate, never ending imagination. But then she told me about you and everything shifted. I didn't want to believe it at first. It was too much to take in. A explosion of such magnitude that I could not talk to her for almost three days. She was desperate and so was I. What passed during those three days and what has passed since has grown into an obsession. To find you. To share everything of her with you. \n\nMy wife always had a story for every situation, the stories were generally not directly linked or relevant to the situation. But that was why we loved her.

She was none the wiser than the others right now. \n\nShe was sitting considering whether she could file the lasagna she had for lunch as a reasonable expense since she'd opted for the more costly solution this day when a black cab drove down the street and stopped outside of the house. A man in his mid-thirties climbed out of the cab got some luggage. When he briefly turned her way she recognised him from her file on the family as the son Hermes, who should be living on the other side of the world and be on a tour at present. \n\n\"Interesting.\" Caverley thought as she ate the last bite of the lasagna, \"Now what are you doing here now?\"", "created_at": "2020-04-07 15:01:46.634749", "updated_at": "2020-04-07 15:01:46.634749", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 371, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 23.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [335], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4103, "user_id": 414, "topic_id": 1275, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Lila pulled up a chair and sat down.

Or maybe it isn\u2019t. I\u2019ve sort of lost the trail of the usual beat to be honest, not that I think I ever really had a decent grasp of it in the first place. But I can be certain that being here is both better and, at precisely the same time, infinitely worse than the alternative. This level feels like a lateral move that is, in actual fact, a shift backwards rather than forwards. But I cannot allow myself to think of it in that way or I might become one of those players who ends their own game, if you know what I mean. I\u2019m not convinced that to do such a thing is the *point* of the game? But, then again, there isn\u2019t any actual guidance on the purpose of the game so, I suppose, it is for anyone to decide. But still, self-destruction does seem counter to the point of most things that revolve around you.\n\nSo what level of the game have I come to and why is it such a backwards storm of the type of shit no one would willingly wade into and, yet, that is what I have done? Well, I was doing alright at the game. I thought. And then this happened. This invisible thing that has almost all players running all about the place. Although this level feels like something I should have passed over already I evidently need to be re-tested in this area. Great. I give every new level I reach my own working title. I have decided to call this one \u201cNot fucking funny Jan\u201d because it is exactly that. Not. Fucking. Funny. Jan.\n\nTo be back at your mum and dad\u2019s house for an indefinite period solo would be enough of situation to land in. But here I am with two children under 5 in tow. Scrutiny of my every move abounds \u2013 I do not have the kind of mother who lovingly scoops up the small ones and tells me to have a cup of tea for five minutes. Oh. No.\n\nThis portion of the game sees me promoted to single parent status while dealing with my own parents telling me how to parent in some kind of loco parentis to me, despite being my actual parents, and providing no useful (grand)parentage of their own. Fuck Jan. It\u2019s not funny.\n\nLook. I know we are *all* playing the game at the moment and all our experiences are different but I\u2019m fairly categorically confident that what\u2019s happening with me will make yours seem ever-so much more tame, unless you\u2019re living in poverty. In which case you\u2019re unlikely to be reading this anyway and you absolutely have my sympathy.\n\nLet me elaborate a little for your delectation. My mother is a challenge. It is as if it is a passion of hers \u2013 being challenging. Only it isn\u2019t. I know this because one of my siblings never experiences this. But, then again, they are the Golden Child and can never do anything wrong (but that is a story for another time). She makes her daily bread from telling my small people \u201cNooooooooo!\u201d with a very specific tone and intonation that makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. I feel very sure it was a tool regularly employed in my own childhood. It is almost like sport with her.\n\nI know you all think that this is like everyone else\u2019s situation and there is nothing new here but let me tell you the things I have done wrong since getting here;\n\n* Washed up wrong. I didn\u2019t use hot enough water (who knew it had to be at boiling point?)\n* Hung the washing out incorrectly (n.b. it all dried, isn\u2019t that the point?)\n* Used the wrong hob to boil eggs (I used the hob specified the day before when I asked about making scrambled eggs and then committed the most erroneous faux pas by assuming the same hob would be suitable for the same food stuff in a different form. Woe is me)\n* Chopped tomatoes in the wrong location in the kitchen (I\u2019m not shitting you here). I was at the island so that I might converse with those in the room. This was incorrect \u2013 one should face the wall when chopping (obviously??)\n\nBut the best (worst) error so far is that my children don\u2019t eat \u201cconventional\u201d food. Yeah. Exactly. I\u2019m still trying to fathom it. It isn\u2019t as though they are fed Heston\u2019s snail porridge for breakfast and the day gets weirder from there. It is her passive \u2013aggressive dig at my living overseas. Oh! Jan! Throw me a bone here! (BTW my mother\u2019s name is Sue).\n\nI spend each day wondering how I will get through each day with my sanity intact. I used to think that I was doing the same thing on the previous level to this but I was wrong.

But here, this evening, it was taking a different turn and she knew Harry was playing with her.\n\nSveta was so ready for this date. She felt that, through their brief exchanges beforehand, Harry had something about him that was going to be fun to explore. It meant she had paid more attention than usual to the tiny little details that people don\u2019t notice until they aren\u2019t done correctly. She knew the importance of the little things after a misspent youth under the guidance of an overbearing Czechoslovakian grandmother in the Sudetes. Maybe she would tell Harry about that later when they would be taking long walks on the High Line with a coffee from Underline, before lingering evening dates that would swell into the next day.\n\n\"Harry, Harry, Harold, Harry! Clearly you are more complex than your sly smile belies. Have no fear though, you're in excellent hands\" Sveta smiled broadly and twisted her hands around one another in front of her face. She had painted her nails, they had gone from her boring-but-functional-daily-client-side-nude to a sweet on-trend pastel yellow.

So.

He wanted her to know that he was there with her. He nodded in mock seriousness without speaking. Then said \"I'm all yours Sveta, stop tweaking your hair or I really will be back in that dream!

I hope that you feel rested and excited about continuing on the collaboration of Babel Between Us.\n\nBefore you dive into it, there are some things I want to go through with you. There are a suite of new tools and possibilities available to you. You've asked for ways to read the text more like a book, way to be able to choose who to collaborate with, and a better way to spin off stories that you think have taken a dull turn. Well, you've got it now.\n\n# Ethnography\nhttps://bbu.world/uploads/babelbetweenus/original/1X/0fd39a7bed2f3bd6894dbf6aab1c907735c0ff7e.mp4 \n\nThe first point relates to the work of the ethnographers, that I hinted upon in our last encounter. The ethnography team will present their findings to you in a separate post, a link can be found in the description of this video. In short, the ethnographers are here to assist you in navigating the increasingly complicated world you are creating. I highly recommend that you watch their video, and read their writeup.\n\n# Babel Reader\n\nhttps://bbu.world/uploads/babelbetweenus/original/1X/426d4d6ecbcc7fa6a3557c9f908baf41ad1c757d.mp4 \n\nThe hosts have told me that some of you found it hard to read texts on the forum. To address this I decided to construct a custom reader, called the Babel-reader, which brings the experience closer to that of a printed book, albeit not the same. It is easy to use and hopefully it will increase your reading experience considerably. [Explore the graphs](http://graph.bbu.world/) and the [codebook](http://codes.bbu.world/).\n\n### How to use the babel-reader\n* You access the reader by pressing the link [Read on Babel-reader] that appears at the top of each post, just under the title. \n* The reader displays a thread as one continuous text and does not by default display the names of each author. To see the author of a post, click the post, and the author's name will appear at the top. \n* If you find the side too bright you can turn on dark mode in the top left corner.\n* This tool is brand new custom Babel technology, and there are still bugs appearing. If you find one, please let us know.  \n\n### ATTN: No Images, videos or other media\n* Because the reader is still in its infancy, it cannot yet handle images being used in the threads. Instead we have decided for us to not use images for now, all previous threads with images will hence unfortunately be inaccessible by the reader. \n* We hope to resolve this in the future. \n\n# Locking Threads: Choose your collaborators\nhttps://bbu.world/uploads/babelbetweenus/original/1X/d5b7fe4bffb08ce984ce33a0824e95d5c16fadae.mp4 \n\nIn this iteration, you have the option to lock a thread to a selected group of participants. This means that you have the option to dedicate a collaboration with one or more other writers of your choosing. Let\u2019s say, for example, that you wish to explore collaboration further with Writer2 and Writer3, but you also make sure that it's only the three of you in the collaboration, the you can lock the thread to the three of you. \n\n### How to lock a thread to a selected group of participants\n* Simply tag the names of the participants you wish to collaborate with at the bottom of the post. You tag a participant by writing @ and then their username, e.g. @babelbob.  \n* The thread will still be visible to all other writers, and they can also quote, or fork, from this thread.\n* Any writer that has created or been invited to a topic are then free to invite other writers to the same topic when they wish to do so. This is done in the same way.\n* Other writers can technically still reply to the thread, but we kindly ask you to respect the social convention that the thread have been locked.\n\n# Forking threads\nhttps://bbu.world/uploads/babelbetweenus/original/1X/d09691df3469992d0361c75212f86c482c98a66a.mp4 \n\nIn this iteration you can create proper forking. Forking means that you create a fork of a thread that is regarded as an alternative continuation of that thread. It is, in a way, similar to quoting, but in the reader it will show up as a continuation of the thread it is a fork of. A thread can be forked at any point. This means that it is possible to explore a different or a parallel continuation of a narrative, regardless of what has already been written. If you don't like the direction a thread is taking, you can make a fork to take it in your own desired connection. You can also use this function to continue a story from a locked thread which you have not been invited to.\n\n### How to create a fork of a thread\n* Go to the post you wish to create a fork from in a thread, and copy the link to that post. This will be the last post before your fork begins. For example, if \"Thread A\" has 13 posts, but you don't like the direction it took from post 6 and onwards, then go to post 5 and copy the link to that post. \n* You copy a link to a post by pressing the little chain icon at the bottom of it. \n* Create a new thread that starts with the text: !FORK, then add a hyperlink to the post to that text. For example: [!FORK](https://bbu.world/t/epidemic/891/10)\n* You add a link by selecting the text you wish to make into a hyperlink, and then pressing the little chain icon, or cmd+k for mac or ctrl+k for pc. You can also type it, then it should look like this: \n\n     `[!FORK](https://bbu.world/t/epidemic/891/10)`\n\n* Then write your continuation of the story. [You can see an example here.](https://bbu.world/t/collaborative-whaling/1039/10)\n* When you come to a fork in the Babel Reader, it is displayed as a small fork symbol. Press this to see what forks are available. [See an example here.](https://read.babelbetween.us/#/t/1039)\n\n# Graphs\nhttps://bbu.world/uploads/babelbetweenus/original/1X/d9a5f25b7dfbd65f533170f997b59ed5406e9de1.mp4 \n\nAs you already have seen, in this iteration you have access to the graph representation of the corpus [through the graph](http://graph.bbu.world/). In the open forum there are detailed instructions on how to use this tool. \n\n# Final words\n\nhttps://bbu.world/uploads/babelbetweenus/original/1X/23a26e16774fb4cad4c521071bf9b59bd9dc8bd3.mp4 \n\nIf you have any questions about any of these new tools and functionalities, contact your host, or write in the new general Babel forum. \n\nI know that you are already aware of the possibility to contact other writers via private messaging. We encourage you to use this as a way of planning threads and ideas. If you do not wish to engage with a writer that has messaged you, just don't reply. If something inappropriate occurs, please contact your host.\n\nOnce again, welcome back, and I wish you a most rewarding second iteration of Babel Between us.

Further, as a man to suggest that the metaphoric violence perpetuated against the female body is somehow generative, for the sake of his own intellectual prowess, is a violent ideology that underpins actual violence and rape culture.\n\nIn fact, perhaps you may find that the systems that will overthrow capitalism rejects the value systems you hold as innocent.

Needs must and all that). \nLook, Harry wasn't an angel in the realm of the profile picture but he had only gained a couple of pounds since that pic was taken and in this lockdown thing? Well, the beard was hiding it all nicely for now. He could get back to that later. Anyways. At the rate this lockdown was going he will have time to sort that before meeting Sveta in person.\nAs for the dream psychologist shizzle? This was not something he had encountered before. It was intriguing along the fun-crazy lines. He liked the idea of a dalliance (potentially more) with the cute psycho babble. (Hell, he liked the idea of most things). It sounds cool! But it's all just a load of crock isn't it? Cooked cheese at night and all that?  All bullshit symbolism? Harry was skeptical but not prohibitively so. He was here for a good time, wasn't he?

He was planning to get one of those standing desks to ease the ache he always got a few hours into a concentrated block of work, but cash flow had all gone a bit haywire at the moment so it was all on hold. Hey ho. The circle of life goes on. He hadn\u2019t thought about what Sveta was seeing beyond looking at himself in the mirror but now he realised, seeing his little visual box in the bottom corner of the screen, that he could have thought through his background just a touch more. Sure the deep window with the half blind that was showing just enough of the night city vista behind him to create the kind of cool. But, perhaps, he should have noticed the underpants he had left strewn from the lampshade earlier that day. Calvin Klein, but still.\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re a dreamer eh?\u201d Sveta said cheekily, rolling her eyes at him in a playful way and holding his gaze a beat longer than Harry expected. He liked it, he could tell this was going to be fun. She blinked, blew upwards to flick her ash-blonde hair out of her face and took a sip of her wine with the side of her head in profile to Harry.

She had two sisters, Juliette Rose Eberhardt and Anna Lavender Eberhardt. Their mother, Maria Theresa Eberhardt (nee Smith) was from a rich but unimportant family. Her father, Jonathan William Woods was from the exact opposite. He came from a northern mining family with roots just south of Carlisle. The unlikely couple met outside, not inside, of a local pub in Lancaster that his father often visited. In the 1930s, Lancaster Castle was not yet the notorious prison that it was known until the early 2010s, but was a police training school. Far more open to the public than a gaol, Maria would often walk the area outside, marveling at the Norman architecture. This would lead her up and down Castle Hill almost daily, as she would go most mornings, and down to the corner of Market Street where she would have a cup of tea. \n\nOne day, she decided to change her schedule. It was a fine summer's evening and Maria thought she ought to take a walk in the evening. Donning her summer shoal, she went on her normal route up Castle Hill from St. Mary's Gate. The air was sweet with a light breeze that only the aftermath of a soft summer shower can afford. Lancaster Castle was built on a site that once housed a Roman fort. An ancient defensive site, one can see for miles from the top giving them control over the whole of *Loncaester*, presumably the Roman name for the city, though we in reality have little idea of what the Romans called it. \n\nHaving had her fill of the history in the air, Maria descended towards Market St as she had done multiple times a week for the past decade. Today though was different. She had gone at night. There was no tea to drink, only pints of ale. Maria was a reserved woman and did not frequent public houses, not even the classy ones. She did not drink ale, that was the drink of men. If she were to have an alcoholic drink, she would have some wine, or sherry, or champagne. Nonetheless, she was parched and home would not be another half hour away by foot.

The only things that were truly important were those that spoke to you, directly, to your soul, that touched you and made you whole. That special something.\n\nShe had seen it in high school. Some people played football because that's what you did to become popular, but some people played it because they had to, but not because someone told them to. They did it because it was the one thing that made them happy, that fulfilled them and gave them worth, in their own eyes. Others took Drama to be dramatic, to be quirky, to complete a college application. But some walked onto that stage because they had to, because the lights and the crowd and being someone else for a few hours was their rush.\n\nIn college, Ruth tried to find her rush, her purpose, the something that would touch her soul. It was hard. She knew it had to be intellectual, academic in some way. She had always been picked last at sport, she had no artistic talents, she was not interested in standing on a stage in front of anyone, whether it was theater or as a motivational speaker or whatever. No, knowledge was her drug. But what? She racked up credits in physics and history and sociology and and and. Nothing, it was all hollow academia that did nothing for her, except take up her time.\n\nSurely there had be something else. The advantage of getting access to a ridiculously large trust fund was that she didn't really have to go to college or work or do anything really except search.\n\nSo she spent her days poring over books and chat rooms and message boards. She travelled to India and Egypt and everywhere and spoke to old men about esoteric subjects. Nothing. Much of it was interesting, sure, and she could find some enjoyment in learning about things other didn't know, but it wasn't her something.\n\nRuth saw the class mentioned for the first time in the depths of a long broken message board from the late 90s, as she lay on a hotel bed in Budapest. Demonology 101. At Harvard. Fucking Harvard. Had to be a joke.\n\nShe ignored it for a while. Had to be a joke. A dumb joke. She kept looking for her something, something to give her life meaning, substance, purpose. More books, more chat rooms, nights and nights and weeks and weeks of being alone and lonely. Those two are not the same, something a lot of people don't understand. Ruth was fine with being alone.\n\nFinally, she went back to the message board. Trawled through hundreds of threads, diving deep through discussions about all things occult and new age. She traced the posters to other boards, to other chat rooms, some long since disused and filled with digital dust. She sifted through that dust, and came out with more references to Professor Walter Chance, and Demonology 101.", "created_at": "2020-06-14 20:51:35.618181", "updated_at": "2020-06-14 20:52:17.929055", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 507, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 20.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [335], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2054, "user_id": 401, "topic_id": 909, "post_number": 2, "raw": "You are getting blurry but still, somehow,\n\nyou are making the trees move\nyou are the dust in the corner of my room\nyou are the birthmarks on my body\nyou are the stains on my shirt\nyou are the spoon when I\u2019m eating soup\nthe mud under my soles\nthe sound of the refrigerator\nthe gentle eyes of a stranger\nthe end of the movie\nthe street lamp lighting up my room\nthe reason why my bag always falls apart\n\nAnd i remember your eyes that afternoon we said goodbye.

We were both in our favourite grey sweatpants and you had on that washed out band t-shirt of mine you fancied.

None of us wore undies.\n\nWe were down there to put the next batch in and set the first batch to dry.

Once we were alone again I propped you up on one of the machines and ate you out as best as I could but it was an awkward angle, too high for on my knees but too low for standing up and we used used the table instead the other times.

MARCUS WONG \n\nI thought it would be safer in New York than in Beijing, but I could not have been more wrong. What started as a national disaster, has become an international problem. It wasn't even easy for me to get out of China, they started enforcing travel bans long ago. I had to make up some shit about going to visit a sick relative; immigration at PEK was not entirely convinced, but did not really care enough to make me stay in Beijing. Shit was bad, but it was America's job to keep me out if I was sick. I was not sick. Not really. Runny nose but that's only a symptom in very few patients. Doctor said I was fine anyway when I went to see him before I snuck away. \n\nIt was late February when I flew to JFK. Took a direct flight, didn't want to increase any chances of getting sick on the way there. Luckily, I have somewhere to stay in New York so I didn't have to worry about accommodation. An old friend of mine from high school who moved to America when he was 18. Never looked back, he said. I prefer China but not when it's sick and on lockdown. \n\nFor a month, things seemed fine. China was exploding with cases, it had started spreading to nearby countries but didn't seem like it would make it over here. Plus, everyone knows about the virus. The government does, the people do; it would be fine, I thought, no way we'd ignore it until it was too late. \n\nAmerica did and it is too late. \n\nLast week, I tried to catch a flight back to China but they wouldn't let me on. It's probably safer in Wuhan now than in New York. Cases there are dwindling, here everything is rising. I'm scared of going out in case I get assaulted for being Chinese.

The door up there is supposed to be a fire exit only, and has one of those handles that's supposed to be held in place by some sort of seal, a plastic string or whatever, but the string is long gone, the victim of some visitor to the rooftop years ago. Some then put a massive padlock on it, the purpose of which would have been unclear, had this been just a building. Why lock the fire exit? There is no way to reach the roof by other means than the door, unless you somehow manage to climb up the crumbling brick facade and then heave yourself out and up over the lip of the roof, which juts out several feet from the wall. Cat burglar stuff, that.\n\nThe fire escapes down the sides of the building are long gone, either fallen apart or taken apart and away to become something else, somewhere else. Some enterprising soul picked the padlock before Maria moved into the building. What was the point of having a roof like this if you couldn't get to it? The lights in the narrow staircase leading up to the door haven't worked in forever, so it's impossible to see if the lock is properly closed or not, and Maria doubts the landlord ever comes here and looks. She knows the caretaker, a surly old Russian, knows about it. He sometimes smokes horrible Russian cigarettes on the sidewalk, and she has found some butts from the same kind on the roof.\n\nUp the stairs to the door. Maria removes the padlock and hangs it from a nail someone has conveniently hammered into the door frame. She takes a deep breath and pushes the door open. Silence. Darkness. There are no lights up here. Dom, her neighbor, tried running a cable up the stairs once to be able to use some sort of lamp. Didn't work. And the cable didn't work anywhere else after. It's hidden inside a cardboard box at the back of one of Dom's enormous closets (how come he has three and she has none?). They take it out every few months and test it. It never works.\n\nMaria steps out onto the roof. She can hear a siren wailing somewhere, but distant, muted, as if she has a thick blanket wrapped around her head. From whatever street the house is on tonight, maybe? Rico on the third floor has spent hours and hours researching the sounds of various police cars, ambulances, and fire trucks from different countries, to be able to place them in physical space from sound alone. She tried talking to him about it once, but became bored quickly. She doesn't really care where they are, as long as it isn't home.\n\nThe door slides shut behind Maria. Above her stretches a sky she has only ever seen up on the roof. She moved around a lot when she was a kid, army brat and then just a brat, so she has seen enough skies to know that this is truly one of a kind. Constellations unlike any she has seen before.

A couple of mother-of-pearl crows lands next to it, looking at you, then turning and speaking the same foreign language to the python, a single beam of sun breaks through the fogs to turn their feathers shimmering in colours much too many and much to complex for the human eye to perceive in full.

Eerie, for lack of a better word.\n\nHe had been infatuated with Florence since the first week of school, and even more so once he realized how smart she was. And funny. Very funny, and not in the class clown kind of way. Smart funny.\n\nShe was also the right kind and level of weird. She liked Jean-Michel Jarre, Pink Floyd,  Buster Keaton, and Paul Auster. Her left shoulder had a tattoo of a swarm of bees, and she was writing an article on applications of lidar, some kind of laser reflecting technology that Serhan knew nothing about.\n\nThis was the first time he spent some time with her, just the two of them. Well, just the two of them apart from the bee weirdos. They kept to themselves though, the weirdos, spread out through the auditorium, keeping a few chairs between themselves and others. Some of them were muttering angrily at the statement from the lecturer.\n\nSerhan glanced over at Florence. She was looking intently at the lecturer and his screen, currently showing a picture of what Serhan assumed was this Swammerdam person. Florence saw him glancing, and smiled briefly at him. She had a great smile.\n\n\"Swammerdam passed suddenly at the age of 43 in 1680,\" the lecturer said. He was a small man, maybe in his 50s, with unruly white hair like a halo around his head, and wore some kind of overalls with lots of pockets.\n\"One can only speculate what his contemporaries believed was the cause of his death.\" he continued. \"His journals from that time are fragmented, at best, so we have no information about any existing medical conditions. The only shred of evidence we have been able to uncover is this.\"\n\nThe lecturer clicked the little thing he held in his hand, and the image on the screen above him changed to show three pages of paper laid out on a white table.

Bodies like broken dolls cover the floor. Blood on the walls, on the floor, even on the ceiling. An outstretched hand trembles, fingers curling like claws, strips of something red and wet hanging from them. The sobbing man is hunched over by a pillar, stroking something shapeless covered by a coat on the floor in front of him. A woman lies twitching over by the far wall. There's a hole the size of a baseball in her torso. The air reeks of metal and offal.\n\nSlowly, a keening rises. There are others waking up now. I look down at myself, checking for injuries. Nothing. I am however stark naked, and covered in ink. Not the random ejaculate that erupted from Blobby. Words and symbols cover my naked skin. Loth, over and over. Blood, over and over. And down my arms and thighs, rows of cuneiform symbols.\n\nI shake my head, trying to dislodge the mist of confusion and arousal that clouds my mind. Loth, is all I can think. Loth.

She smiles at me.\n\n\"Hello,\" she says. \"When is the unveiling?\"\n\nThen her smile widens and widens and opens up into a scream. She howls straight at my face, and then faints, falling to the floor in an untidy heap. Others are clambering to their feet.

The sudden giddy mirth he had felt at the prospect of a fight evaporated and left him with the bitter metallic taste of mind tempering in his mouth. \n\n\"'Look, I'm not in the mood for mind games!\" He said loudly as he upped his pace after the bounty hunter, \"Mika if that is you...\"\nHe trailed off as Jean, the right hand witch to high priestess of ***The Conventicle of the Crimson star***, stepped out from behind one of the old willow trees that lined the larger park and had been downwind of him. Jean wore a set of dark green cargo pants and a black tank top with a band print on it, her hair was dyed a fitting crimson red and her tan skinned and tattooed arms were covered in bangles that sparkled in the sunlight. \n\n\"She really does look like one of those punk girls pretending to witchcraft\" Richard thought to himself eyeing her as she stood there.\n\nJean walked towards him and Richard took a weary look around, it wasn't as easy for her to do that mind trick on him if he knew it was coming but he wasn't interested in getting flanked by someone. The C.S was generally on good terms with Richard's pack the ***Greypelts*** but the peace between the different groups within the hidden community was always a tenuous thing. \n\nSatisfied that he at least couldn't spot or smell any other people within casting distance, Richard turned his attention back to Jean who now came to a halt a few yards away from him.\n\"Hi Rick.\" she said smiling, her heavy lilac perfume covered most of it but Richard could detect the mix of fear and uncertainty that he recognised as trepidation.\n\"Hi Jean,\" Richard answered, \"Why are you here, John was one of ours, you know that we have jurisdiction over this.\"\n\"Yes, yes, you are going to duke it out in the woods and may the one who wins be the one who was right.\" she said rolling her eyes at him, \"Have anyone ever told you that you lot can be frightfully macho?\"\nRichard just stood quiet and watched her, he really didn't have time for this.\n\"I'm not going to interfere with you. But I do want to give you a piece of advice that you may thank me for later,\" Jean said and stepped in close with her hands raised in the universal gesture of no harm intended, \"It would be better for all of us if you throw this fight.\"\nRichard looked at her for a minute, then scowled and shook his head. Throwing a holmgaang just wasn't the done thing.\n\n\"Look, I was sent here to see to it that that man, Adam Spurr, have safe passage back south with his bounty.\" Jean said looking at him imploringly, \"Rick, I'm begging you, please, please don't kill that man whatever you do. Rough him up if you have to, but please, please let him return with his bounty. It could mean war otherwise.\"\n\nRichard read Jean's face and smelled the fear the now was almost pungent in her scent, this was not a threat, at least not from her, someone was pulling strings and holding a gun to her or her coven's head. The only people with that power Richard knew of was the region's hidden council, but they would have contacted the Greypelts, about it directly. No this was something else. \n\"I'm guessing that John really fucked with the wrong crowd then?\" Richard said hoping that this would prod Jean to divulge more.\n\"You don't know the half of it...\" Jean sighed but looked relieved that Richard was talking with her, \"Rick, John Spade killed a clan elder's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and the whole family of the high priestess of the ***Steel Talon***-coven. Rick, he tried to start a war between them.\"\n\n\"Well... shit...\" Richard said and blew some air out between his teeth, then felt around his pockets for his mobile \"Ok, yeah, no... let me make a phone call, I'm not pack head. But I'm guessing Mike would want to know about this before we do anything.\"\n\"Thanks Rick\" Jean said.\n\"Hey, don't thank me yet,\" Richard said as he dialled Mike, \"Mike might decide an example still needs to be set.
