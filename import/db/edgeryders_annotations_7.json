[{"id": 8092, "text": null, "quote": "A couple of years ago i participated to a contest called \u20185 voor 13\u2019 that gave people the challenge to find through use of new technology solutions for healthcare problems. It was organized C-Mine Genk, an innovation laboratory in the old coalmines of the Flemish region of Limburg. I got selected as one of the finalist for my solution for a solution for the intergenerational gab, commonly known as the kids that don\u2019t visit grandma anymore because she is to old\u2026\nFor my solution I started by looking at the obvious part: intergenerational contact is good for the health of the elderly and also good for the development of the kids on multiple levels. So what was missing is a tool that brought them together.\nI grew up in a rather unconventional setting for people of my generation and later (90s kids like the internet would say) My parents and i shared the house with an elderly woman that wasn\u2019t my grandmother but the godmother of my dad. She was rather cultivated woman with brought knowledge about geography, literature and history. She helped me out on my schoolwork and we shared our interest in reading the news. When she started having difficulties to move out of the house, I helped her staying young by introducing her to the then new technology called DVD and PS2. We played bowling on the Wii and if she would have stayed around longer, I\u2019m sure she would have used my tablet. In opposite to my grandmother who was visiting us every week, my \u2018m\u00e9m\u00e9\u2019 stayed young in her head, and i think it was patly thanks to our dayle exchanges. She would learn me about history and i would learn her about technology.", "created_at": "2017-01-22 19:08:31", "updated_at": "2017-01-22 19:08:31", "tag_id": 1024, "post_id": 783, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 750}, {"id": 12861, "text": "", "quote": "How could we open the debate about the strength of intergenerational care.", "created_at": "2017-11-28 19:41:35.445349", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:31:37.728159", "tag_id": 1024, "post_id": 541, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 508}, {"id": 11302, "text": null, "quote": "I am a member of the Inaugural Class of Minerva Schools at K.G.I., as well as Minerva\u2019s, Mental Health Services Programs Coordinator for Berlin and Buenos Aries. Which sounds great, but seriously, what the heck does that even mean?\nMinerva is a new university that aims to reimagine the paradigm of higher education, based on the science of learning. All classes are seminars, with a flipped classroom structure. Meaning that we students, learn the content on our own and spend time engaging with the deeper concepts behind the material. Moving the emphasis away from the professor teaching and instead towards students learning.\nAll of this is facilitated by Minerva\u2019s online platform where all classes take place. Every student (no more than 20 per class) webcams into class, where the platform allows our professors to more easily check how much everyone is participating in the discussion, send us into breakout groups, and live poll the class. Beyond being of instructional benefit, the online format takes away much of the typical costs of facilities development and maintenance that traditional universities place upon their students. Additionally, it allows Minerva to be a genuinely international experience. Our student body is comprised of students from over 40 countries. We live and travel together to seven cities (in as many countries) in cohorts no greater than 150 students. \u00a0\nThis unique structure has brought together an amazing community, with potential for changing many of the ways we view higher education. However, there is one factor of higher education that I work most with, and that is students\u2019 mental health and wellness! Minerva students\u2019 have necessarily high work loads, a variety of cultures and constantly transitioning lifestyles, which makes it the perfect edge case to gain insights on how to improve mental health care in universities.\nAccessibility of Resources:\nIn the U.S., a 2014 study found that the average ratio of university mental health professionals to students is about 1:2080. This means that students in need of counseling services face long wait lists and a low amount sessions, resulting in care that is often literally too little too late.\n\nThis has a simple fix: dedicate resources so that students who seek help can get it! The real challenge comes in getting students to value their own well being and to reach out when they feel they need mental support. 80% of students who commit suicide (the second leading cause of university student death) never come into contact with any staff from the counseling center. How do we address these issues?\nThe answer is Cultivating Care through Community!\nThis is where my work comes in. As a student working on the school\u2019s mental health team I get work on changes that try and address mental health before it becomes an impediment to education. Currently, I am working on a training for students to learn how to better manage their self care and stress management. Additionally, we are adapting trainings from other universities to include aspects from the science of learning, and create a more lasting impact. A prime example of this is the Student Support Network Training (originally developed at Worcester Polytechnic Institute), where students are nominated by their peers to learn how to better understand their own mental health, as well as support friends by caring for them in crisis and connecting to the resource they need.\nIn addition, it\u2019s no longer enough to focus solely on the counseling department\u2019s efforts to improve students wellness. Our academic team offers periodic sessions with deans and professors to help students improve their writing, time management and other skills that can lead to increased stressed when not appropriately addressed.\nThe Student Experience Team has created a series of traditions that brings the student body together as well, to fight the isolation that can commonly occur when students transition into college. Every monday evening a different student takes a leap of faith and give their \u201cMinerva Talk\u201d, by sharing the story of their life so far. On Wednesdays students gather in small groups for Supper Clubs where they all bring some food to share as they explore questions that push them to be vulnerable.\n\u00a0\nWhile we still working on figuring out a lot of how we address student well being (and build this university) it\u2019s become clear that the future of student care must be holistic and not just reactive.\n\u00a0\nI\u2019m curious to hear your thoughts and also what you are working on!

Working classes as care classes, that's a strange idea that never occured to me:\nEven in the days of Karl Marx or Charles Dickens, working-class neighbourhoods housed far more maids, bootblacks, dustmen, cooks, nurses, cabbies, schoolteachers, prostitutes and costermongers than employees in coal mines, textile mills or iron foundries. All the more so today. What we think of as archetypally women's work \u2013 looking after people, seeing to their wants and needs, explaining, reassuring, anticipating what the boss wants or is thinking, not to mention caring for, monitoring, and maintaining plants, animals, machines, and other objects \u2013 accounts for a far greater proportion of what working-class people do when they're working than hammering, carving, hoisting, or harvesting things.\nThis is true not only because most working-class people are women (since most people in general are women), but because we have a skewed view even of what men do. As striking tube workers\u00a0recently had to explain\u00a0to indignant commuters, \"ticket takers\" don't in fact spend most of their time taking tickets: they spend most of their time explaining things, fixing things, finding lost children, and taking care of the old, sick and confused.\nCaring too much.

I am also studying a postgrad diploma part-time in Sustainable Development.\nHaving completed a Bachelor of Business and an honours degree in Information Systems Management in 2013, I was hopeful that I could find employment.\nAfter completing the course, I decided however, that I did not want to work with technology on a continuous basis, as I found that the final specialised year was soulless.\nDuring college I had done some volunteering, and so, knew that I had a leaning towards working in business for a social cause.\nThe other constraint I had over the years, was an accumulation of a few gaps in my C.V because of past mental health issues. I had started suffering from anxiety in my teens which really affected my self-esteem. This condition really impacted my development. So, by the time my friends were going to college at 18, I stayed at home and was happy to take care of my grandmother who needed support. I was on and off medication for a long time.\nI tried lots of things, individual counselling and group therapy, which really did help me. Success really came for me through trying alternative therapies such as bio energy, acupuncture and reiki.\nUnfortunately, we live in a society that places huge stigma around mental health issues so in terms of employment, people are encouraged to cover up any such issues. The C.V gaps gave me less of a competitive edge in the job market and I was 8 months unemployed after college. The emphasis placed on having experience to get jobs can be an obstacle. Even though I had experience volunteering throughout my time at college, I found that companies don\u2019t recognise volunteer work, because you haven\u2019t been paid for it.\nI decided to return to volunteering again, for a wonderful NGO where after 3 months a shop management position presented itself. That was like winning the lotto for me, I can tell you!\nI don\u2019t like the money grabbing, I need there to be a social dimension and something more sustainable. Unfortunately,only 8 months in, this wonderful NGO working to support development overseas had to close their Irish operations, to make the charity more sustainable. I went on to get my current job as a charity shop assistant, again after an 8-month search. I love working in this environment, as you get to meet real heroes with real struggles and tales of survival.\nIn 2015, my Mum got cancer. My beautiful Mum has always been a brave and determined warrior. My folks have undergone a lot of problems with housing during the economic downturn in Ireland. They moved in with one of my uncles who is a diagnosed schizophrenic to take care of him. They each have always played the role of carers in both of their large families, often taking on huge burdens of care for their siblings, very selflessly and very much to their own disadvantage. The thanks they end up getting for their efforts, is having to look for a new home while Mum was in the early stages of cancer, due to one uncle behaving very aggressively and selfishly toward them.Mum did not need to be further subjected to that kind of stressful behaviour.\nThankfully, after a short search period, my folks ended up moving into a house in my neighbourhood.This was hugely beneficial to me, as I was then positioned to be of help to them, where I could, in supporting Mum on her journey to recovery.\nThe past few years have really been a very harsh eye opener for me, into the affects an economic crisis has on people\u2019s lives. It has detrimental impacts on people\u2019s health, welfare, living conditions and psyches.\nThe other side of the coin is, that I have fortunately come to discover, the absolute profound healing and joy that comes from people around us, the hearts and minds of people who genuinely care.\nThat sense of community and connection is the most important aspect to life and has certainly helped me and my family to cope through the last few years.\nThere is a dire need for an extension of this supportive community, in tackling the many varied and complex social issues of our time.\nThe most recent suicide and cancer statistics, highlight the absolute urgency, in finding alternative ways, of connecting and supporting the people who are struggling within our communities.\nThanks to all involved in Edgeryders for all your hard effort in attempting to achieve that!\nI hope this community will be very successful in its reach.\nLove and best wishes to you all!

Poland most likely is the only country in the world that had abortions legal by law (1956-1993) and changed it \"backward\".\u00a0We ended up having one of the most restrictive laws in the world, and the legislators were smart, by\u00a0avoiding criminalizing women (with whom society would sympathize) and focusing instead on everyone else who assists with abortions (the penalties are up to 8 years in prison), creating a system of fear and paranoia.\u00a0\nThe first thing that strikes\u00a0about abortion in Poland is the statistics - according to Polish Ministry of Health in 2013, there were 744 legal abortions and 718 of them due to the risk of birth defects. 3 of them due to rape and 23 due to the risk posed to women health. In 2015 there were 1044 legal abortions. For a country with 38 million inhabitants, these numbers seem just wrong. In Spain or UK, these numbers are 200 or 400 times higher. And it's estimated that illegal abortions every year account for between 80.000- 200.000 cases in Poland.\u00a0\nSo, what kind of abortions are available in the underground and how do women access it?\nChirurgical abortions are one of the common ways. They\u00a0usually happen in\u00a0hidden spaces, often barely up to any standards, with basic equipment, sometimes only in the presence of doctor (women who come to get the abortion might end up assisting them). The price of an abortion is at least\u00a02000 zl (500 euros), and it tends to go up with the standard. In some cases, when doctors are well connected, they can even perform them in hospitals, which would double the price. Many doctors who refused to perform a legal abortion are perfectly fine with doing it illegally after settling the price with their patients.\u00a0\nConsidering that the minimal wage in Poland is 1850 zl, and the average is 4000 (yet many people struggle to get contracts, work on 3/4 of full time, or often work on irregular gigs earning even less than 1000 z\u0142 a month with no minimal wage per hour), the price is quite prohibitive and exclusive. Many women end up taking\u00a0loans to pay off their abortions.\u00a0\nNowadays, women contact pro-choice organizations to find out\u00a0who can help them with abortion. Since the 90ties, press and internet advertisements were the ways to find\u00a0doctors who'd perform them. Such services would be named as \"painless restoration of menstruation\"\u00a0- and involve either chirurgical help or access to drugs, highly overpriced. In many cases a friend or a relative knows who does it in your town. The fear and paranoia remain anyhow - women are asked to leave the clinic right after the procedure is done, regardless of their condition, in order not to bring suspicion. They're asked to park their cars far away from the place of appointment.\u00a0\nSome of the informal groups specialize in organizing abortions abroad. Ciocia Basia, a group of volunteer activist, helps to organize legal abortions in Berlin. For a price of 290/390 euros, they arrange pharmacological and chirurgical abortions in clinics, help with translations and offer a couch for the women coming over. Another popular destination is Slovakia and Czech Republic - it's super easy to find websites in Poland of clinics in these countries that provide with professional and anonymous help. Prices are similar to those in Polish underground.\nAnd then you have the pharmacological abortion. There are two drugs containing\u00a0misoprostol registered and available in Poland, one of which can be bought without the prescription. Women usually end up making up stories about stomach pain or rheumatic grandmothers to buy them. Sometimes both of them can be obtained from \"under the counter\", forums also advise to ask a man to help\u00a0buy them. Misoprostol should be accompanied by mifepristone to increase effectiveness (the combination of both has 98% effectiveness, while only misoprostol alone is between 80-90%), but the latter drug is not registered in Poland. In this case organizations such as Women on Waves help to buy and ship\u00a0them from other countries (they ask for donation of minimum of 70 euros, but they do support women in economic difficulties by providing them for free). It is well known that some of the doctors write prescriptions for these drugs (a pack of 12 costs 25 zl, but can be sold 10 or more times more expensive on the black market) and help women get access to them via advertisements. It's impossible to track as these drugs are not refunded by the state - therefore not registered anywhere.\u00a0\nDue to lack of widespread support, some of the women organize support groups on online forums. They look for other women who seek\u00a0abortions or just had one, share their stories\u00a0and explain to each other what happens to their bodies, how to access drugs, if nausea is a normal reaction to pills, etc. As in some cases, pharmacological abortion can lead to prolonged bleeding and even death, they offer each other a call of support during the abortion, which takes up to a day. It's recommended to call for an ambulance in case of emergency - doctors cannot tell if the miscarriage was illegally inducted or not, and that save\u00a0lives in some\u00a0instances of home abortions.\u00a0\nI am still reading some more about the abortion underground in Poland, and if I find some more interesting facts, I will updated this text.

What are your thoughts on this?\nTo make it easier for everyone interested to follow I will try to sum up the thoughts we had and the experiences we made recently.\nStarting with the question \u201cHow can food help people on the move to feel at home wherever they are at the moment?\u201d amongst others we got to talk to a 24 year old guy from Syria and a girl from Korea about the same age. One had to flee home and the other moved for love.\nSome of the most remarkable insights we got are about food some are not. Two I want to share because they add to our design question.\nThe guy misses the Syrian nights where as he tells everyone takes their coaches and pillows outside, drinks tea, smokes, chats and just sleeps on the streets. Maybe this does not happen in big towns he says but in villages as in smaller or medium-sized towns it does.\nThe girl told us that she is missing the Korean street food a lot. Once she tried out a Korean street food market here in Berlin, but did not like it. She went there with some friends, to chat, meet new people and have some good Korean food but it ended up being too expensive, there was even an entrance fee and the food was just not good. In Korea she always used to eat outside with her friends. Cooking was a family thing; eating out was for all other social events.\nAfter those interviews we talked about the \u201cBerlin Thaipark\u201d, were mostly Thai women sell homemade southeast Asian dishes on their blankets more or less being tolerated by the bureaucracy; about a great project by the New York based designer Candy Chang called Street vendor guide where she visualizes the most commonly violated rules in this context for the vendors themselves; and asked ourselves: How can we enable migrants to integrate the interactive food customs / traditions they like and bring from their culture of origin into Berlins community life?\nLater on one of our fellow students told us the following:\nA group of Syrian refugees mentioned the huge summer barbecues they would always have in summertime back in Syria: a lot of friends, family, a lot of food, somewhere in the nature, in a park. When being asked if they are doing similar activities here in summertime they deny. They think that it is forbidden to have a barbecue anywhere outside and do not want to act against the law seen their uncertain status. Still they miss them.\nThat basically is how we ended up facing the design question already mentioned above: How can we help newcomers to use public spaces to their full extent, because they do not know what activities are legal in these spaces and are afraid to act against the law?\nSo far we, a group of 4 university students, call our little project A Taste of Home and would be more than happy about any comments.", "created_at": "2017-01-22 22:31:57", "updated_at": "2017-01-22 22:31:57", "tag_id": 1074, "post_id": 683, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 650}, {"id": 8284, "text": null, "quote": "Well done, @Luisa and all. I like how you narrowed a generic problem down to a specific one (integrate the interactive food customs / traditions).\u00a0\nIt may be harder than just writing a step-by-step guide to starting a street food activity and translating it into several languages.\u00a0I do not know Germany well, but in Italy the regulatory landscape is a lot tighter than what seems to go for Asian markets (eg Thailand). The moment you start serving food to the public, you need to comply with licensing, safety,\u00a0hygiene regulations. Additionally, many market operate a fixed number of stalls: you cannot just add a food cart as you would in other parts of the world. All of this increases the fixed costs of starting an activity. Every year, as the summer comes and festival season kicks in, the police braces to fight off illegal hawkers (who are, for the most part, just people trying to make a living, many of them migrants). The legal ones are very vocal in demanding that the police shuts down their competitors on fairness grounds (\"we have to comply with all these expensive regulations, whereas these guys just go gray economy\").\u00a0\nIn passing: within Europe there are already subastantial regulatory differences. I live in Belgium, and here tiny restaurants with toilets in the basements, that you access through narrow and steep stairs, are very common. In Italy they would all be illegal: restaurants need to have wheelchair-friendly facilities, fire exits whose number and width depend on venue\u00a0capacity, and so on.

If one cannot bring a simple solution to the market because of the iters for safety and quality certification, and this we agree is bad, the solution should not be \"ok, let's ignore this step and bypass it\".\nThere are a number of issues here. 1st and foremost, one has to describe how safety and quality are reasonably assured, and what safety net would be put in place should something still happen (although we know they are not perfect, to use an euphemism, today a number of tools and services exist to cover for assistance, accidents' costs, etc on the side of providers).\nOf course, one could ignore this. Depending on the IP scheme, no safety nets would be needed (although it would nice to think of them), for example. But this brings us to a second issue, one that\u00a0is almost\u00a0\"ethical\": transforming every patient in a maker can leverage the citizen-scientist effect only if (this is presented as\u00a0gut feeling here, but I am open to discuss it in depth later)\u00a0the right IP scheme is adopted. And only if radical openness is adopted one can truly claim no responsibility over the final \"accidents\" that will always happen (only that which does not work, will not break).\u00a0Should the creator preserve control of the IP for itself, one will always find a court that will consider the business model \"exploitative\", and enforce the order to establish the aforementioned safety nets (there is an interesting case about a fire happend in an AirBnB apartment that touches on this topic)... falling back to the problem one wanted to work around, just a bit later.\nSo, what would be the general ecosystem' services that would keep this garden grow orderly?

Let's be honest with ourselves and remember that researchers are very optimistic people (I belong to the category, so this is self-criticism). They will produce proof of concepts, hardly ever demonstrators (although they usually confuse the terminology), and they don't normally ask themselves questions like \"how long will this work continuously?\", \"what will be the safety mechanism once it turns off, as instance because of battery exhaustion?\", how many scenarios are realistically recapitulated in the lab I used for the tests, and how well does this solution generalize?\",...\nLet's not dive in the argument of healthcare provision on this topic. Sometimes it is the right reflection to face, some other it is populistic... In these circumstances it reminds of the sentence I have recently read on twitter \"being poor means having too much end of the month\"... it may steal a smile, but it's a classic example of ill-posedness.

A great project by Jonas Rylander which we find very inspiring for our design challenge you can read about in the following post.\nWhat are the expectations about the use of public spaces when it comes to cooking on the street?\nEven tough I already put up a short r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of our research phase here, now follows the detailed version to allow an even better understanding for everyone interested. Also we would like to share the other surprising insights we have gained so far. Maybe they are helpful to one or the other and maybe some of you would like to contribute. What are your thoughts on and what is your interpretation of all this? We would be very thankful for any comments!\nTo first introduce us: We are a group of 4 university students from Berlin, three product designers and one socio economic communication designer and call ourselves \u201cA Taste of Home\u201d. How we came up with the name and the following design question, I will tell below:\n\u201cHow can we help newcomers to use public spaces to their full extend because they do not know which activities are legal in these spaces and do not want to act against the law?\u201d\nTwo month ago we went into the field asking ourselves \u201cHow can food preparation contribute to make people on the move feel at home and include other people living in this \u201cforeign\u201d country?\u201d Amongst others we ended up talking to one 24 year-old guy from Syria and one girl from Korea about the same age. One had to flee home and the other moved for love.\nBoth of them are living in a caring environment. One in a shared flat with wonderful people (\u201clocals\u201d) who are all very closed to each other and the other together with her boyfriend who originally is from Germany. After having found out about this we dropped the second half of our starting question \u201c[\u2026] and include other people living in this \u201cforeign\u201d country?\u201d , because we did not see this need anymore. They are already sharing their everyday life with \u201clocals\u201d, therefore also cooking with them. At least in this context one could say, they are well integrated. This left us with \u201cHow can food preparation contribute to make people on the move feel at home?\u201d\nIn terms of food culture we found out that it is mostly about eating as an occasion. It\u2019s about the taste, but even more about the surrounding atmosphere. The Syrian guy once got invited to the home of a Syrian family also living in Berlin for dinner. The food was \u201cyummy\u201d and \u201cIt tasted, just like it does when my mom cooks.\u201d, but what he enjoyed even more were the conversations, the way things were handled around the table. The two little boys of the family were fighting over the remote control just like he and his siblings used to do back home. There was a lot of fooling around which not just he but everyone enjoyed.\nBoth the Syrian guy and the Korean girl are still cooking dishes they know from back home, even though it never tastes as good as it does when their moms cook. They both said that they left home to early to develop great cooking skills and learn all the tricks. In Korea traditionally a woman would only start cooking by herself after her marriage. Nowadays a lot of young people are leaving the country, respectively their parents\u2019 homes, not being married and therefore without the entire knowledge. But as said before, they are both still trying and sometimes calling their mothers to ask for help. The Korean girl once even tried to sign up for a traditional Korean cooking class to improve her skills but unfortunately it was immediately booked up. Since then she has been hoping for a new opportunity. It seems that missing the food one grew up with is a good motivation to become active. Good food triggers people to do something. It is important to put the emphasis on the word something, because both of the interviewees recognized that it is also the missing time, which keeps them from cooking all the recipes they used to love back home. Some just take too much time in preparation: \u201cMaybe 4 to 5 hours.\u201d, the Syrian guy told us. Having to divide their time between work, German classes, socialising and cooking most of the days they are not willing to spent these many hours on the latter.\nBefore going on and explaining how we reshaped our design question with this knowledge in mind, I would like to share one more surprising insight we gained through the two interviews.\nTalking about food and well being the Syrian guy told us that when he had just arrived to Germany, he did not like to eat outside. It disgusted him. Not being able to see the food preparation made him feel uncomfortable. We tried to find out the reason for this, whether it was because he eats Halal, which he does or it was out of cleanliness concerns, but yet could not manage to do so. We still have to ask again. What happened here shows one of the difficulties we had conducting the interviews. The question triggered some awkwardness. This we felt, but why we were not able to tell. Was it because the subject was sensitive to the respondent and his eating customs? Was it because he did want to offend us since we were talking about German food? How can we overcome such awkwardness whenever it occurs in future interviews?\nTo go on with the process of our research I would first like to recall the reshaped design question: \u201cHow can food preparation contribute to make people on the move feel at home?\u201d It still seemed like the question was to broad to be solved in one design project. This is why we changed the target group \u201cpeople on the move\u201d to \u201cyoung migrants\u201d (20-30 years of age). We felt that the latter was more suitable for coming up with a specific design and the people we had interviewed both fit in this category. We then went back to synthesising the interviews once more and found that they were totally worth a second look. There was this whole topic of interactive food customs and traditions we yet had not paid enough attention to.\nReviewing our notes we got to understand, that for the people we had talked to \u201cfeeling at home\u201d in the context of food culture was a lot about the interactive customs and traditions which they had been surrounded by most of their lives. The Syrian guy misses the Syrian nights where as he tells everyone takes their coaches and pillows outside, drinks tea, smokes, chats and just sleeps on the streets. He told us, that this maybe does not happen in bigger towns but in villages as in smaller or medium-sized towns it does.\nThe girl told us that she is missing the Korean street food a lot. Once she tried out a Korean street food market here in Berlin, but did not like it. She went there with some friends. They wanted to have some good Korean food, chat and meet new people. It turned out to be a disappointment. It was too expensive \u2013 there was even an entrance fee \u2013 and the food was just not good. In Korea she always used to eat outside with her friends. Cooking was a family thing; eating out was for all other social events. Considering these stories it made sense to rephrase or specify our question to: \u201cHow can we enable young migrants to integrate interactive food customs / traditions they like and bring from their cultures of origin into Berlin\u2019s community life?\u201d Furthermore it was then that we came up with our group name \u201cA Taste of Home\u201d.\nIt finally was the comment of a fellow student, which led us to modify our topic to what it is about now. She told us about an interview her group conducted with three Syrian refugees. During their conversation the interviewees mentioned the huge summer barbecues they always would have had back in Syria: a lot of friends, family, a lot of food, somewhere in the nature, in a park. Having been asked if they are organising similar activities here in summertime, they denied. They thought that in Berlin it was forbidden to have a barbecue anywhere outside and did not want to act against the law seen their uncertain statuses. Still they miss them. It was this story which made us change the question to: \u201cHow can we help newcomers to use public spaces to their full extend because they do not know which activities are legal in these spaces and do not want to act against the law?\u201d\nThis question has to be considered on different levels. The higher-level question is: \u201cHow to harmonize the expectations about how to use public spaces?\u201d What do \u201cnewcomers\u201d, what do \u201clocals\u201d, what does everyone using those places want and how can the once being mutually exclusive to each other being handled? The second level is the topic of cooking on the street. Where, how and in which contexts is cooking in public spaces wanted? And last but not least the design challenge is about getting to know the legal frame and making it graspable for everyone.\nAll this is related to the fact, that there are a lot of refugees staying in camps where they do not have any opportunity to cook at all or even if they receive \u201cfood money\u201d instead of catering, they only have access to a shared kitchen. Another guy from Syria we cooked with lives in such a place. He told us, that the huge number of people who are sharing the kitchen there is often keeping him away from cooking. Though some of his friends who are living in another camp without cooking facilities sometimes join him for cooking. How can we enable them to make cooking a regular part of their lives again?", "created_at": "2017-04-15 19:34:22", "updated_at": "2017-04-15 19:34:22", "tag_id": 1074, "post_id": 506, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 473}, {"id": 8293, "text": null, "quote": "Hey @Noemi, this is just something cultural that people have always been doing in\u00a0Morocco, it's about going out to catch the cool breeze after a hot summer day and of couse cook together...however there has been a change in the policy in the last couple of years, and it is\u00a0not allowed to cook in public parks any more even though they use\u00a0a traditional\u00a0portable clay pot for coal/making fire and there is no hasard in cooking open air in such way...\nWhen people go to the countryside for weekends/holidays, they always take the clay pots to cook their own food in the nature...even though there are restaurants available everywhere.", "created_at": "2017-04-15 19:37:37", "updated_at": "2017-04-15 19:37:37", "tag_id": 1074, "post_id": 18382, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 473}, {"id": 8294, "text": null, "quote": "Of course there are many issues about copyright, legal implications, safety, patenting and certification.

Our idea is that the people\u2019s needs or \u201cprojects brief\u201d come from the interaction between students and community. Needs are based on problem that community faces every day. Community care about that problems and is interested in solving them. Nowadays we have students that go out of the university just to collect information and then come back to develop in a \u201csecret\u201d way they project they are working for.

Since design students work on different topics every year there is the possibility to develop projects from different areas of expertise and give to teams the opportunity to learn on the fly and testing their ideas in the real world.\nHOW?\nWe would like to achieve that goal through the involvement of some fix representative of University such as professors. They work as facilitator in order to promote this projects to different courses or levels. We would create an Identity for this initiative in order to make it visible and recognizable. By using a common platform, we want to show what we can do for them and stimulate the conversation about what could be done. Students will have the possibility to organize activities such as focus group, workshop, games etc. to collect knowledge and involving people.

Expressing and being silent. Creating new realities requires both in my experience. Going into something, almost blindly. Being into the question, into life, almost unconsciously. Letting go of what I already know. And at the same time being fully aware of what's happening, even when I don't know where I'm going. I'm fully aware of what I'm experiencing, all of the feelings and sensations, getting to know myself. To me, creating is about holding space and love, it's also about exploring new states of being. More expansive versions of myself. Going into the unknown.

The story of a social studies teacher who gives an assignment to his junior high school class to think of an idea to change the world for the better, then put it into action. When one young student creates a plan for \"paying forward\" favors, he sets in motion a wave of human kindness which went nation wise. There was one main emotion which did lead these actions but also was produced or given back \u2013 love or/and compassion. Can this happen in real life?\nBoth psychologically and scientifically has been proven that positive emotions affect our health in a very positive way was well. Positive emotions release healthy hormones into our body and not only; the unhealthy release of cortisol and stress related hormones is lower as well. The most important emotions are gratitude, peace, joy, hope, and love. This external boost of positivity also creates neuro-pathways in the brain that are positive. This means that we are able to affect on the biological part of our brain and create a source of positivity which is supported externally as much as internally. Behavioral psychologists retain that even if aggressivity might be considered part of human nature, meaning that it is imprinted in our brain because of our ancestors or as part of human nature, a non aggressive behavior or approach can be taught. What would happen in the world if there would be more love and less aggressiveness?\nThe teacher on the movie says: \u201cIf you could help change the world, would you? What does the world mean to you? How often do you think about things that happen outside of this town? Do you watch the news? We are not global thinkers yet. What does the world expect of us? What if the world is just a big disappointment? Unless, you take the things that you don\u2019t like about this world and flip them upside down. How about, is possible? The realm of possibility, exists where? In each of you. So, you can surprise us. It\u2019s up to you. Or you can sit back and let it be. Make an attempt to interact with the world.\u201d And the kid gave his idea: \u201cPerson A, is me and I help three people in doing something that they cannot do by themselves.\u201d There was one condition, each person who was helped by the kid had to do the same thing with other 3 people, so there would be 9 people helped. And so on, each person with 3 people, and then other 3, and 3 more\u2026 A whole network of people helping one another.\nIn this world is so easy to be skeptic and cynic. It is bad but also the media is playing a big role in reinforcing the bad. Without even being aware we cause and attract negativity to ourselves. We fight, we hate, we break promises, and we disrespect nature, over think of our role as humans in this planet. This movie is one of those that stick with you and I have always wondered if this is something that can be applied in our everyday life. I was talking with a friend and colleague of mine \u2013 we have this new and fresh NGO, with no offices yet and we are trying really hard to get some money at least to cover costs for activities. I talked to her about the movie and the idea, if there is any chance to transform it into a project. The point where we are stuck is that we have not been able to find a way to measure the results and how to report it to the donor. However, what if we could start a campaign, spread the idea out there, and try to do it with no donors in order to not report to anyone. It needs money anyway.\nBut, what if it is possible? What if we can learn and teach how and to love? There is this video on youtube of a young man acting quit aggressively on a tram. You see all the people scared and panicking. All but an old lady, who took his hand on hers and just stayed like that sited near to him. The young man calmed down. That insignificant gesture of kindness might have saved his life and of other people who might have reacted the same way to him or with fear.

It is estimated that worldwide over 508,000 women died in 2011 from breast cancer (Global Health Estimates, WHO 2013). This represents about 12% of all new cancer cases and 25% of all cancers in women.\nIn all countries, early detection remains the cornerstone of breast cancer control in order to improve breast cancer outcome and survival. In health systems with developed infrastructure, physicians regularly examine the breast as part of a routine female check-up (usually once or twice a year) in addition to mammography. However, this routine procedure is \u00a0provided at varying levels of time investment and care.\nDiscovering hands has a number of advantages:\nBy using the extraordinary sensory capabilities of visually impaired women, a perceived \u201cdisability\u201d is transformed into a capability. A completely new field of meaningful employment is created.\n\u201cMedical Tactile Examiners\u201d (MTEs) are trained to deliver physical breast examinations at doctors\u2019 practices. During a 9-month training period they learn how to use a standardized diagnostic method for examining the female breast. Additionally, all MTEs are trained in communication skills and breast-specific psychology, as well as administrative tasks typically carried out by a doctor\u2019s assistant. MTEs are either directly employed by resident doctors or hospitals, or they work for different practices and/or hospitals on a freelance basis.\nConventionally, a regular breast examination carried out by a gynecologist takes between 1 and 3 minutes. The discovering hands MTE invests at least 30 minutes for each session, not only examining the breast, but also educating patients on how to cope with the risk of breast cancer. Patients feel that they are well taken care of and receive the best possible preventive examination in a pleasant environment.\nPreliminary qualitative results, conducted by the University of Essen, show that MTEs detect ~50% more and ~28% smaller tissue alterations in the breast than doctors (5-8mm vs. 10-15mm). A clinical, peer reviewed study is currently being conducted at the University of Erlangen.\nOur vision\nWe are operating as a social business because we believe in the our value proposition (to the healthcare sector, and institutions supporting people with disabilities). We are committed to the social \"win-win\" of our model: offering meaningful employment to blind women, and creating an opportunity for them where they have competitive strength; and helping to improve the breast cancer early identification situation and awareness for the most common cancer among women.\nCurrent roll-out\nDiscovering hands is planning to substantially increase the number of MTEs in the years to come. We currently operate in Germany and in Austria. In both India and Colombia we have pilot projects running with scale-up in planning. And we are interested in further country roll-out, which we operate through a social franchise.\nIf you are a social entrepreneur and would like to implement discovering hands in your country, contact us. Also, if you are an impact investor and are interested in collaborating with us to further roll-out the model, please contact us too.

I mostly remember him for knowing probably all brand new, absurd Twitter accounts, and being able to quote quite a lot of their content.\nThen I have learned a bit more - and the more unveiled, the more impressive it got. There is a great reason for us to team up and work on the challenge together: Hacking, internet security, and medical devices. He knows a lot about that stuff.\n\u00c9ireann with his friend, Dr. Marie Moe started investigating the security of pacemakers - as Marie's life actually depends on a little instrument that generates each of her heartbeats. And runs\u00a0on a proprietary code. This means she has to implicitly trust the programmers, and despite her and Eireann\u2019s years of assessing devices for security holes, they wouldn\u2019t normally be \u201callowed\u201d to investigate the security of such devices.\nThis implies how little a regular customer of similar devices is informed about the ways they work, what protocols and tools they use, where their data is stored, etc. It has everything to do with person's safety - and still, companies keep most of the key information secret from the users, making them more vulnerable.\nI suggest you watch this great video from 32C3, where Marie and \u00c9ireann tell about their journey.\nObviously, the issue of safety transcends this case and applies to a whole range of tools that increasingly improve our quality of life and longevity. The security flaws are potentially causing exactly the opposite, making for a health/life hazard. There are concerns about privacy too, where your medical data flows around the world to companies that may or may not be taking measures to protect it.\nBut that's not all - \u00c9ireann works also as an advisor for European Network for Cyber Security (ENISA), has founded http://www.concinnity-risks.com/, and works as a Senior Risk Researcher at Cambridge Centre for Risk Studies. He is loosely affiliated with I Am The Cavalry, a cyber security movement, whose motto is \u201cSafer. Sooner. Together.\u201d\nHe contributes to our OPENandChange application vast expertise in the security of medical devices, and embedded devices. He will be helping DIY makers, programmers, and engineers with training on how to build safer code, and what standards they will want to comply with to produce products for different markets. He's also offering insight into vulnerability research and standards-based research, contributing safety and transparency knowledge to this huge, open swarm OPENandChange wants to become. Lastly, he loves the idea of preparing a consumer training and equipping people who rely on medical devices with knowledge and clear questions they can ask about their own devices.\nFinally, \u00c9ireann has just been announced an Open Web Fellow for Privacy International and he will be taking the word out about our idea while advocating for open cyberspace.", "created_at": "2017-01-27 19:10:43", "updated_at": "2017-01-27 19:10:43", "tag_id": 1125, "post_id": 712, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 679}, {"id": 8479, "text": null, "quote": "I\u2019m not sure to what extent @Eireann Leverett \u2018s claims are sustainable (missing data). The regulations (IEC 60601) requires thorough documentation of the safety. Anyone knowing the certification process of medical devices will know how much paperwork it takes. This documentation effectively renders the device sort of \u2018opensource\u2019. It's accessible to 3\u2019rd parties (regulating bodies etc). Clinical trials of safety has been carried out. Scientific publications (open source) and probably patents (open source) will have been published. Risk assessment \u00a0documentation occupies entire folders. The costs to the company forces developers to do their very best (in theory). Yes, it's not open source to the regular customer, but what would it serve?. Afterall it takes an expert to understand. Regulations are born to protect the consumer, but they are resource expensive meaning that devices become excessively expensive in confrontation with production price. (Maybe now regulation monsters\u00a0have grown to feed lawyers and bureaucrats )\nHonestly, would you dare to hack a pacemaker or implant one that was running opensouce version 42-beta last\u00a0edited by someone with an obfuscated name\u00a0?\nMore interesting. Is there some documentation that opensource software is more reliable compared to\u00a0proprietary code with a relevant approvals? The opensource development or hacking is extreme programming where bugs gets fixed, new ones introduced and iterative improvements are taking place. Unless you believe in afterlife I don\u2019t think you would accept being beta tester of your pacemaker. \nNon life-critical medical devices (low hazard) could be open source, when failures will cause little or no damage. Especially those not being provided by the health service.\nP.S. I think CE marking the waterdispenser is a lot easier than getting approval for a medical device and there is no comparison. \n\u00a0\nBottom line @Alberto\nIt would be a great idea to develop a FAQ or rather a book of knowledge/best practice for OpenSource Medical Devices.\nPlease let it be based upon evidence and legal references", "created_at": "2017-01-27 19:12:58", "updated_at": "2017-01-27 19:12:58", "tag_id": 1125, "post_id": 21205, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 679}, {"id": 8480, "text": null, "quote": "First off, let me apologise for the long delay. I have been truly buried in work, and my life got heavily disrupted by personal matters for a couple months.\n@Rune\nI think we have some miscommunication here. I'm not suggesting open source is more reliable, or the only way to go with medical devices. However, there is an issue of transparency of the code to the patient, that has 'similar' issues to the issues of open source.\nOn your other points though, you rightly note that there is a lot of safety and regulation around medical devices. However, we still know that user input issues pervade the safety of medical devices. For examples, see the paper Preventing Medication Errors by \u00a0P Aspden, J Wolcott, J L Bootman, L R Cronenwett:, or any of a number of papers by Harold Thimbleby. The paper Killed by Code written by Sandler et al, also details many case studies that you might be interested in. Getting back to the point about safety regulation, I don't believe that safety regulation takes security into account as regularly. This istarting to happen, but very slowly. This is why the paper \"Pacemakers and implantable cardiac defibrillators: Software radio attacks and zero-power defenses\" is so powerful. They took an FDA certified device, and showed it was possible to make it operate unsafely after some security analysis.\nThere are many more things we might discuss about regulation, such as the FDA's limited resources for looking at the code of the devices. However, there are some good things too, such as the MAUDE database. http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfMAUDE/search.CFM\nBy making this database available, we can search for adverse events and study this in an evidence based approach, as you rightly request. I'm not here to inflate the claims, and honestly I prefer to let Marie do the talking about these subject because her patient viewpoint is balanced and essential.

The aim is to focus on reducing\u00a0the number of inpatients over fifty years of age with entering the hospital with preventable ailments such as heart disease, high cholesterol, dementia, and lung cancer.\u00a0\nThe hospital is based\u00a0in The Liberties in Dublin, which got its name in the 12th century due to its location just outside Dublin City's walls \u2013 lands united with the city, but still keeping their own jurisdiction (hence \"liberties\"). The area's history is still very relevant to the health of its residents.\nBeing outside the city walls, the Liberties became a hub for trade and craftsmen. The 19th century saw the Liberties become dominated by large brewing and distilling families, most notably Guinness who built the world's largest brewery there. With this industrial wealth, however, came dire poverty and slum living conditions. Today the Liberties\u00a0is a city neighbourhood of opportunities and innovation, but its history -\u00a0positive and negative -\u00a0pervades. Although having undergone much urban regeneration as well as gentrification,\u00a0the Liberties still embodies that juncture between being a centre for enterprise and commercial life as well as being home to large blocks of inner city social housing. Homelessness, drug use, and lower than average life expectancy are some of the problems facing\u00a0in the Liberties today.\u00a0\nOn researching in the area first-hand, it was observed that there was a distinct lack of male presence in local community centres, as well as a high number of men drinking alone in pubs. The Liberties Local Health project draws on this observation to engage those lone drinkers to become members of a local brewing club, where beer is brewed by locals, for locals.\nThe\u00a0project takes its inspiration from the highly successful Men\u2019s Sheds mental health initiative whose\u00a0motto is, \u201cmen don\u2019t talk face to face, they talk shoulder to shoulder.\u201d\nHOW?\nThe\u00a0brewing club for men over fifty\u00a0in the locality \u2013 where they create a low percentage beer brewed by locals,\u00a0for locals \u2013\u00a0harnesses existing local\u00a0skill sets of the hundreds of Guinness factory retirees.\nThe brewing club, \"Sl\u00e1inte\", takes it name from the Irish word for \"cheers\", also meaning \"health\". The aim of the club is to\u00a0encourage\u00a0more responsible drinking through\u00a0appreciation of the brewing process\u00a0as well as forming a sense of pride and comradery among members. The project was commended by health industry professionals after its presentation at Dublin\u2019s Active Age Conference 2012.\nWith Ireland's craft beer market having hit\u00a0\u20ac59 million in 2016 (up form \u20ac40 million in 2015) and volumes of beer from Irish microbreweries having increased by 415% between 2011 and 2015, the brewing club \"Sl\u00e1inte\" has high viability potential to run itself as a social enterprise overseen by members, bringing with it a sense of pride, achievement, and overall better health.\nUSER JOURNEY", "created_at": "2017-05-22 18:35:20", "updated_at": "2017-05-22 18:35:20", "tag_id": 1138, "post_id": 841, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 808}, {"id": 8523, "text": null, "quote": "It's a grand idea and project. \u00a0Your writeup says it started in 2012. \u00a0How has it been going since then? \u00a0Has it got those men to talking with each other more? \u00a0I am sure it does, even if it is about the beermaking. \u00a0That by itself would show it as a success since those guys aren't so alone anymore..", "created_at": "2017-05-22 18:37:02", "updated_at": "2017-05-22 18:37:02", "tag_id": 1138, "post_id": 10198, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 808}, {"id": 8524, "text": null, "quote": "In Cameroon, parent children discussion on sex education is a taboo. When ever an adolescent brings up a topic around \u00a0reproductive health or sex \u00a0education, they are usually severely punished \u00a0and regarded as been disrespectful to their elders. Due to this absence of discussion on sex education, many adolescent young girls face lots of challenges and stigma at their puberty stage, especially during menstruation.Most parents in Cameroon especially in the rural and grassroots areas, don't know that they have to provide pads for their girl children during menstruation. They don't even give their girls advice when these children even summon a little courage to inform them that something abnormal is happening with them .According to many parents, these children are very immature and still very young to be able to handle understand and process issues on puberty , reproductive health and menstruation. Because of this lack of discussion between parents and children on sex education, many of these girls, during menstruation are forced to stay away from school because of stigma from boys who often notice blood stains on their uniforms and also the unpleasant odor which \u00a0cames out of the bodies as a result. \u00a0Their staying away from school, makes them not to be performant as they ought to be like the boys and this plays a key role for their poor performances. Some stay away for two weeks and others for a month, just to avoid this stigma. As a youth advocate to encourage parent children dialogue on sex education and advoacting for Access to reproductive health knowledge, i have had time to hold some trainings with a few groups of adolescent girls to tell me about their experiences. \u00a0As a result of lack of menstrual hygiene, due to absence of \u00a0dialogue between them and their parents, \u00a0i was amazed by the stories i got. Some said, as they approached their parents \u00a0when\u00a0they noticed boold stains on their pants, they were thoroughly scolded and driven away and warned never to discuss any thing on menstruation. Some said, they were forced to carry dry dust and sand to\u00a0insert into their vaginas in order to stop the bleeding as they knew not what was happening to them. Other stories came up like using \u00a0dirty clothes to pad themselves, which was very in hygienic and gave them some genital infections. \u00a0As a result of this lack of knowledge on reproductive health for adolescent girls, many have dropped out of school because of unintended pregnancies, some have contracted sexually transmissable infections and others have been forced into early marriages , to the boys that impregnated them. Many of these \u00a0adolecents have lost hope for a better future, because they are now in condtions due to necglect and lack of reproductive health knowledge. \u00a0so i am hoping to enlightened parents and the community about the importance of sex education and also advocating for this curriculum to be taught in primary and secondary schools in Cameroon. I am hoping, to equally train these adolescent girls on matters of gender equality, menstrual hygiene , family planning and reproductive health as a Whole.

When I hear myself describe to them what we do in our courses (like dressing up and dancing around cardboard sculptures of alien Christmas trees), I sometimes find it difficult to take myself seriously. However, as most people that work in a creative field would probably tell you, it really is stressful. Being creative is intense. Apart from the financial uncertainty and competitiveness that tend to run in these professions, the work itself is very demanding, mentally and emotionally. It is very easy to become personally invested in a project, some might even call this is a necessity. Because they are so closely intertwined, it is often difficult to separate between the professional and the personal. How does this affect the way we deal with issues of mental and emotional wellbeing in this context?\nIn Product Design, we are constantly brought to question our surroundings, our decisions, and most importantly, ourselves. There has been a crisis point in almost any project where this turned into seriously doubting myself and hating all the work I had done. Sometimes, it led to absolute public meltdowns. To me it is a strange and uncomfortable feeling to share such intimate moments with people I work with.\nMany of my friends that study creative subjects have told me about similar experiences in their lives, particularly about struggles with insecurity and stress of varying degrees. Are these emotional strains simply an occupational hazard that we as creatives have to accept? Are they something we should embrace, something we actually need to produce meaningful work? There seems to be a romanticized idea of the tragically ailed, mad genius, based on the stories of countless artists like van Gogh or Beethoven that produced some of their best work during periods of Depression or Hypomania. Joshua Walters proposes in his Ted Talk \u2018On being just crazy enough\u2019, that those suffering from mental conditions might just be more sensitive to the world than others and that we can use our \u2018skillness\u2019 to our advantage. Many scientific studies suggest in fact, that there is a link between creativity and mental illness. One theory is that those with strong creative inclination perceive the world with a heightened awareness and tend to be more reflective and ruminate in their thoughts.\nFor me, a host of questions and problematics arise out of this. How do these factors influence people in creative fields in reaching out when in distress? At what point does these different pressures stop aiding creativity and start impeding it?

I've recently been reading a lot of Thomas Mann and it's almost the entire structure on which his work is predicated. There seems to have been a sensibility that was propagrated in the late 1800s -early 1900s European intellectual/artisan culture around 'bohemianism' or latterly 'bourgouise'. I think in some senses it emerges out of a combination of Romanticism (in poetry and visual art) and it's opposite reaction,\u00a0Realism (in painting and literature) and the beginnings of the sentimental nostalagia-tinged\u00a0classical music of people like\u00a0Verdi and the German/Austrians like Liszt, Mendelsohn.\u00a0\nThe 'struggling artist' becomes a trope, a series of hooks onto which musicians, writers and painters can hang their emotional responses to the world. The struggles of the artist can therefore\u00a0be equated to the struggles of the working, pastoral man and woman, who often during this period are the themes on which the artist work. c.f Beethoven's 6th, Robert\u00a0Burn's Poetry, Victor Hugo.

I am also studying a postgrad diploma part-time in Sustainable Development.\nHaving completed a Bachelor of Business and an honours degree in Information Systems Management in 2013, I was hopeful that I could find employment.\nAfter completing the course, I decided however, that I did not want to work with technology on a continuous basis, as I found that the final specialised year was soulless.\nDuring college I had done some volunteering, and so, knew that I had a leaning towards working in business for a social cause.\nThe other constraint I had over the years, was an accumulation of a few gaps in my C.V because of past mental health issues. I had started suffering from anxiety in my teens which really affected my self-esteem. This condition really impacted my development. So, by the time my friends were going to college at 18, I stayed at home and was happy to take care of my grandmother who needed support. I was on and off medication for a long time.\nI tried lots of things, individual counselling and group therapy, which really did help me. Success really came for me through trying alternative therapies such as bio energy, acupuncture and reiki.\nUnfortunately, we live in a society that places huge stigma around mental health issues so in terms of employment, people are encouraged to cover up any such issues. The C.V gaps gave me less of a competitive edge in the job market and I was 8 months unemployed after college. The emphasis placed on having experience to get jobs can be an obstacle. Even though I had experience volunteering throughout my time at college, I found that companies don\u2019t recognise volunteer work, because you haven\u2019t been paid for it.\nI decided to return to volunteering again, for a wonderful NGO where after 3 months a shop management position presented itself. That was like winning the lotto for me, I can tell you!\nI don\u2019t like the money grabbing, I need there to be a social dimension and something more sustainable. Unfortunately,only 8 months in, this wonderful NGO working to support development overseas had to close their Irish operations, to make the charity more sustainable. I went on to get my current job as a charity shop assistant, again after an 8-month search. I love working in this environment, as you get to meet real heroes with real struggles and tales of survival.\nIn 2015, my Mum got cancer. My beautiful Mum has always been a brave and determined warrior. My folks have undergone a lot of problems with housing during the economic downturn in Ireland. They moved in with one of my uncles who is a diagnosed schizophrenic to take care of him. They each have always played the role of carers in both of their large families, often taking on huge burdens of care for their siblings, very selflessly and very much to their own disadvantage. The thanks they end up getting for their efforts, is having to look for a new home while Mum was in the early stages of cancer, due to one uncle behaving very aggressively and selfishly toward them.Mum did not need to be further subjected to that kind of stressful behaviour.\nThankfully, after a short search period, my folks ended up moving into a house in my neighbourhood.This was hugely beneficial to me, as I was then positioned to be of help to them, where I could, in supporting Mum on her journey to recovery.\nThe past few years have really been a very harsh eye opener for me, into the affects an economic crisis has on people\u2019s lives. It has detrimental impacts on people\u2019s health, welfare, living conditions and psyches.\nThe other side of the coin is, that I have fortunately come to discover, the absolute profound healing and joy that comes from people around us, the hearts and minds of people who genuinely care.\nThat sense of community and connection is the most important aspect to life and has certainly helped me and my family to cope through the last few years.\nThere is a dire need for an extension of this supportive community, in tackling the many varied and complex social issues of our time.\nThe most recent suicide and cancer statistics, highlight the absolute urgency, in finding alternative ways, of connecting and supporting the people who are struggling within our communities.\nThanks to all involved in Edgeryders for all your hard effort in attempting to achieve that!\nI hope this community will be very successful in its reach.\nLove and best wishes to you all!

Cos\u00e1in is the Irish word for \u2018pathways', reflecting our belief in different paths not single roads, and the guidance, wisdom and support that we can find in the stories of each others individual journeys. All quotes within this article are from research performed by Galway Mental Health Services Consumer Panel, the local representative body of mental health service users for the geographic region.\nGMHSCP advocates for supports and services which are fit for purpose from the perspective of service users, and the integration of users of services into the design, \u00a0development and delivery of services, working in partnership with the Irish Health Services (HSE) based on the value of our lived experience of current systems of care, and the evidence of our own healing processes.\n\u2018The most effective help I have experienced over the years, having had years of medication, psychotherapy, hospitalisation, is the support of peers, where I am treated as normal, with kindness, not judged, and not expected to conform to the medical model of treatment.\u2019\nWhere progress was slow or absent within the system, we took\u00a0it upon ourselves to prototype and demonstrate how necessary supports could be delivered in partnership and collaboration between health providers, community groups, and local authorities based on a cooperative ethos of mutual support. We believe our approach will be of value and benefit because\n\u2018it's a community based project concerned with 'well-being' which is preparing fertile ground for the empowerment and transformation of people, individually and as a group. It's organic growth reflects the personalities and desires of the people involved, making it of and for the people.\u2019\nOur belief is that properly resourced and equipped communities can provide more effective intervention in cases of crisis,\u00a0care in a more person-centred and human manner, and both at a lower cost than the dominant acute-oriented, clinical and biomedical approaches. We believe that only approaches that are grounded in local communities and emerge from their dreams and aspirations\u00a0can meet the needs which we are presented with in the time that we have.\n\u2018My experience of large organisations is that the individual gets lost in the system and become just another number\u2026 I\u2019m sick and tired of waiting for the HSE to offer people the support they want\u2019\nWe also believe that the act of mutual support is amongst the most therapeutic of acts, transforming relationships from ones of being a recipient and subject of care, to a space of\u00a0autonomy, collective development, peer provision and mutual reliance that involves people in generating their own solutions.\n\u2018Being with people who are doing whatever we can to have our lives the way we want them, seeing the evidence that people can succeed, that we can make a difference \u2013 all this has a positive effect on my own mental health, self-esteem and my ability to shape my life the way I want it.\u2019\nWe developed our initiative over the course of the Galway 2020 Bid process, using \u00a0participatory design exercises that brought together a range of groups and individuals including\u00a0independent therapists,\u00a0health professionals, service users and patients,\u00a0and other interested parties who are seeking to develop new models of community-based health promotion and care.\u00a0We then used the blank canvas of a disused city building, visioning and combining elements of artspace, green makerspace, and wellness supports that were brought together using the concept of an\u00a0integrated cultural and community hub. During this time we came into contact with EdgeRyders and the Opencare research project, and welcomed the opportunity to form productive partnerships at European level with groups and initiatives with similar ethos.\nOur current operating model exists with the support of Galway City Museum, who have provided us with the use of a room one day a week for prototyping and co-design. This is taking place as part of the Galway City Cultural Strategy, which seeks to use \u00a0cultural resources and infrastructure for wellness supports and public health.\u00a0These sessions were an extension of the earlier co-design process, deployed in a real-life environment for feedback from stakeholders and re-design. Our sessions to date have included artistic and creative process, peer support and educational sessions, based on the demand from service users.\u00a0\nCurrently delivered on a volunteer basis for proof of concept, our intent is to progress towards a cultural space and \u2018crisis cafe\u2019 on a social enterprise model, with a welcoming cafe-type front-of-house drop-in space that can be used as an open studio and learning space, with a supportive backstage of more intensive interventions, therapies and supports for those people in emotional distress. Our model is grounded in the value and authenticity of provision of supports and services that are delivered by people with the direct personal experience of the situations in question, and the expressed need based on our research for appropriate creative outlets that support emotional wellbeing and generate meaning and community for the participants.\n\u2018in Irish culture mental health tends to be seen as a failing by an individual, of an individual, in an individual. This attitude views the natural processes of emotional distress and recovery through a lens of pathology, individualised blame, guilt and shame.\u00a0In contrast, rather than attempt to seek what Zygmunt Bauman called \u2018individual solutions to collective problems\u2019, an impossible task, we felt the need for the sake of our collective sanity, to use an approach based on collective support and interdependence.\nOur story is just beginning.", "created_at": "2017-04-17 23:06:34", "updated_at": "2017-04-17 23:06:34", "tag_id": 1140, "post_id": 757, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 724}, {"id": 8558, "text": null, "quote": "Thank you so much for sharing your experience and your story with us.

There were three lads living there already - Kieron, Dave and Billy. Kieron was the leader. He had a drill. Billy was very pale and very thin - kind of morose somehow while at the same time desperately optimistic. He looked like he hadn't seen a vitamin in months. Dave on the other hand, was just mad. At this point, quite obviously, even certifiably, mad. Just a week or so before he had actually escaped from the psychiatric hospital over the road, bringing to mind a scene from 'One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest'. And over the course of our time together, Dave told me a few stories about that place, that enlightened paragon of metal health provision which had held him body and soul for all of nine months. He told me how he preferred prison, because at least in prison you got a release date. He told me about the electric shock therapy, which left your mind totally scrambled for two or three days, then left you feeling more or less ok for two or three days but with no memory, after which they did it all over again. He told me about being chained to four big guys who were there to 'look after him', even when he went to the toilet. About how if he didn't go along with something that they wanted him to do, sooner or later he'd get held down and recieve a knock-out shot delivered to his buttock, which resulted in unconsciousness and a noticeable reduction in his ability to stand up for his rights. Essentially, he didn't have any rights. He was mad. They could do whatever they wanted to him. The detail that most appealed to my Kafkaesque understanding of faceless institutions, was that the refusal to accept that he was mad was taken as evidence that he was still mad. Refusing to take the pills that made him heavy and slow and stupid was seen as proof that his sanity had still not returned. Now you just try to imagine regaining your mental balance under this kind of perverse authority. They say what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, but I'm not so sure I believe them. Dave's approach was to break out of the place and find himself a squat to live in with a couple of mates and several total strangers, one of whom had been recognised by Kieron from a free party, when they bumped into each other down at the job centre. Its amazing what gets hatched down at the job centre, and I'm not talking about anyone finding a job. But anyway, when we turned up at the squat, Dave was living on the sofa in the lounge in a haze of ashtray cigarettes and cheap cider, eyeing the curtains nervously and never far away from a large knife. You got the feeling he was pretty keen never to go back inside that place if there was anything he had to say about it. And he wasn't leaving the house, or even that room much at this time. Absconders from mental health institutions tend to be automatically served with arrest warrants by the local magistrates, and I don't suppose that was helping his mental health any either. Dave seemed to be doing pretty well as far as I could see, considering everything that he'd gone through so far in his life. He told me his Dad was always drunk and often violent. He said his mother had been killed, shot by a farmer standing in front of her dog trying to protect him while out for a walk. That was when he left home. He'd had a job as the look-out for a gang of thieves that robbed industrial units at the age of nine. A little later he'd gone to live with a family of Irish travellers who'd trained him to be a bareknuckle boxer, a discipline at which he was apparently quite talented. Some time after that he'd bought a house, back when they gave mortgages to people with no job, no credit rating and no intention whatsoever to make even a single repayment. That episode lasted a few months, during which time he acquired an addiction to crack and heroin, or 'brown n white' as it was known on the estate. That was when the mental health issues really kicked in. I could sometimes see the different personalities fighting for control inside Dave's head. So much suffering just couldn't be contained inside one self-image, so the ever resourceful ego just created a couple of others to help take the strain. I think it was fair to say that Dave was feeling the pressure. And of course, he couldn't go to get any medication, because he knew the Doctor would just arrange to have him arrested as soon as he arrived at his appointment. \n\u00a0\nOn the one hand, Kieron and Billy were quite happy to have Dave and his knives living on the sofa. After all, this was a squat, and you never know what might go down. Sometimes you have to defend a place, and while Kieron liked his drill, that was about the limit of his handiness. And if anything serious went off you'd most likely find Billy in a cupboard. So Dave had his uses. And anyway, they were mates. But in this condition, he wasn't exactly easy company. So naturally, Billy and Kieron started to pal up a little. They shared a floor in the house with a kitchen in it, they went outside from time to time. They liked to get stoned together, and have a laugh. But this was unsettling to Dave somehow. He'd been mates with Billy for years, since the time he bought the house. He had no family left, no real friends after all the alcoholism, the drugs, the crime, and the madness. Billy was about all he had. And now he was feeling him drifting away. It all came to a head one full moon. It 'd been building for a while. You could feel it all through the house, under the neon strip lights in the corridors. Tension. The more Dave got wound up, the more Kieron and Billy retreated into their little flat. Sometimes you could hear him shouting incoherently in the lounge on his own. It wasn't very reassuring. But on this particular night, we found him shouting slightly more coherently, and it wasn't at himself. It was directed at Kieron. Dave was pacing the lounge, muttering to himself, wild-eyed. Then suddenly, something snapped. He grabbed his largest knife from under the cushions of the sofa and stormed out in the direction of the stairs. Larissa, sharp as ever, phoned Kieron fast and told him to lock his door. She was just in time. \n\u00a0\n'Yer fuckin big gay bastard! Open t'door.' \n\u00a0\n'Fuck off Dave' said Kieron, with his foot set hard against the door to keep his demented friend from getting in. \n\u00a0\nIt wasn't looking good. Dave was stabbing the door repeatedly with his enormous blade, while Kieron, who fortunately for him liked to eat a hearty meal, was leaning against it with all his weight. \n\u00a0\n'Open t'door or I'll fookin kill yer both'\n\u00a0\nIf I open t'door, that's when you'll fookin kill us both, was more what it looked like. \n\u00a0\nThe rest of us were gathering downstairs in the lounge. We'd known these people a week, and this was the only place we had to live. We were not ecstatic about the situation. And besides, we were worried, as much for Dave as for Kieron and Billy. We really liked Dave. He was a lovely lad, underneath all the addictive behaviour, the paranoia and the threat of imminent violence. I'd had a good connection with him from the start. We both had Irish ancestry. We shared a dark sense of humour. Dave's kind of funny was to make unbelievably hot curries, knowing that Billy didn't like them, but that he had no money and that there was no other food in the house. And then to watch Billy eating them, as his face got redder and redder, and his expressions grew ever more absurd. That was like Dave's perfect joke. So anyway, I headed up the stairs, with Dom close behind. The stairwell was pulsating, neon, harsh light. Nowhere to hide. Kieron's door was closed now, with the giant knife stuck in it, wobbling, and Dave half-shouting half-sobbing, desperately scared of losing his friend, his mind, his freedom. I wondered about his family history, and how much comprehension he had of his own emotional reality. It can't have been easy for him. And I thought about my own safety. But however erratic he'd been acting, I didn't feel any kind of malicious intent would be directed towards me.\n\u00a0\n'Dave, Dave. Dave man, it's me.'\n\u00a0\nDave was in his own world, and it was breaking down.\n\u00a0\n'Dave, what's up man? Why don't you put the knife down?'\n\u00a0\nHe kicked the door a couple of times, just desperate now, more than dangerous. My heart broke for him.\n\u00a0\n'Dave, you're bleeding mate! Look. Let me see that hand.'\n\u00a0\nDave looked at his palm, which had been cut by the knife as he had rammed it repeatedly into the door. It wasn't serious, but it was badly enough to make a fair mess. The sight of his own blood seemed to bring him back to himself. All the fight had gone out of him now. You could see he was ready to be taken care of.\n\u00a0\n'You should get that seen to Dave. You want me to come with you mate, we'll go down to the A&E dept at the bottom of the road?'\n\u00a0\nHe let me lead him away, still staring at his bloody palm, and I placed my arm around his shoulders as Dom discretely removed the knife from the door and hid it out of sight. The crisis it seemed, was over. At least for now. But still, we had an evidently pretty broken human being on our hands, and what the hell were we going to do about that?", "created_at": "2017-01-22 19:18:13", "updated_at": "2017-01-22 19:18:13", "tag_id": 1140, "post_id": 502, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 469}, {"id": 8562, "text": null, "quote": "Against this backdrop, the topic of mental and emotional resilience seems really a thing we should put our minds to.

Which sounds great, but seriously, what the heck does that even mean?\nMinerva is a new university that aims to reimagine the paradigm of higher education, based on the science of learning. All classes are seminars, with a flipped classroom structure. Meaning that we students, learn the content on our own and spend time engaging with the deeper concepts behind the material. Moving the emphasis away from the professor teaching and instead towards students learning.\nAll of this is facilitated by Minerva\u2019s online platform where all classes take place. Every student (no more than 20 per class) webcams into class, where the platform allows our professors to more easily check how much everyone is participating in the discussion, send us into breakout groups, and live poll the class. Beyond being of instructional benefit, the online format takes away much of the typical costs of facilities development and maintenance that traditional universities place upon their students. Additionally, it allows Minerva to be a genuinely international experience. Our student body is comprised of students from over 40 countries. We live and travel together to seven cities (in as many countries) in cohorts no greater than 150 students. \u00a0\nThis unique structure has brought together an amazing community, with potential for changing many of the ways we view higher education. However, there is one factor of higher education that I work most with, and that is students\u2019 mental health and wellness! Minerva students\u2019 have necessarily high work loads, a variety of cultures and constantly transitioning lifestyles, which makes it the perfect edge case to gain insights on how to improve mental health care in universities.\nAccessibility of Resources:\nIn the U.S., a 2014 study found that the average ratio of university mental health professionals to students is about 1:2080. This means that students in need of counseling services face long wait lists and a low amount sessions, resulting in care that is often literally too little too late.\n\nThis has a simple fix: dedicate resources so that students who seek help can get it! The real challenge comes in getting students to value their own well being and to reach out when they feel they need mental support. 80% of students who commit suicide (the second leading cause of university student death) never come into contact with any staff from the counseling center. How do we address these issues?\nThe answer is Cultivating Care through Community!\nThis is where my work comes in. As a student working on the school\u2019s mental health team I get work on changes that try and address mental health before it becomes an impediment to education. Currently, I am working on a training for students to learn how to better manage their self care and stress management. Additionally, we are adapting trainings from other universities to include aspects from the science of learning, and create a more lasting impact. A prime example of this is the Student Support Network Training (originally developed at Worcester Polytechnic Institute), where students are nominated by their peers to learn how to better understand their own mental health, as well as support friends by caring for them in crisis and connecting to the resource they need.\nIn addition, it\u2019s no longer enough to focus solely on the counseling department\u2019s efforts to improve students wellness. Our academic team offers periodic sessions with deans and professors to help students improve their writing, time management and other skills that can lead to increased stressed when not appropriately addressed.\nThe Student Experience Team has created a series of traditions that brings the student body together as well, to fight the isolation that can commonly occur when students transition into college.

Psychological struggles are still stigmatized, making it hard to reach out for help. We want to offer an alternative way for people to engage with the topic and develop mechanisms for support and resilience.\nMental illnesses are one of the most widespread disabilities worldwide. In Germany alone, 4 million people are affected by issues like anxiety or depression. Yet, it\u2019s a secret we all share. Seeking help for psychological struggles is still strongly associated with shame. Even being sad or stressed or unproductive is seen as personal weakness. As a result, many people find it difficult to talk about emotional problems \u2013 be it a missed project deadline, a loss in the family or an eating disorder.\nIt\u2019s easier to open up to someone who has similar problems and can empathize. But how to identify the people that can offer support when everyone tries to hide their struggles? Most people that are in emotional distress don\u2019t decide to seek help until they have been in increasing pain for a prolonged amount of time. Only about 35% of people suffering from depression are receiving treatment. On average, 11 months have passed before even these few seek out professional help.

MAZI aspired to fill this gap in Greece.\u00a0At this moment there are 3 groups in Athens and one in Thessaloniki.\u00a0The ultimate goal is the creation and support of a nationwide network of regional annexes empowerment of people with mood disorder and mental health promotion.\nDuring the meet ups of MAZI\u2019s self-help groups, the participants share their experiences, personal feelings, information and strategies that have been developed to deal with mood disorder and live a fulfilling life. These sessions are about peer-support through sharing personal experiences, knowledge, concerns, worries and strategies.\nParticipants are people who have been diagnosed with mood disorder (Major Depressive Disorder, Dysthymic Disorder, Bipolar Disorder I and II and cyclothymic disorder). The groups often include relatives and friends of people with mood disorder. These groups do not have a therapeutic clinical role and therefore do not replace or supersede any medical, psychiatric or psychotherapeutic treatment that the participants may receive.\nThere are no expert lectures and no self-pity parties. These self-help groups are meet ups of optimism, hope and encouragement. The specific objectives of the programme are:\n\n\nto support and encourage members in regaining control and improving the quality of their lives and their relationships.\n \n\nto provide an environment of emotional support, which reduces isolation and alienation, moderates despair and increases optimism, personal responsibility and self-acceptance.\n \n\nto help members extract greater joy and satisfaction from life, in spite of difficulties, obstacles, frustrations and setbacks.\n \n\nto help members learn and practice new, more effective and satisfactory ways of relating to others.\n \n\nIt is a collective and individual responsibility of each group member to make the discussion a safe place for sharing. We respect confidentiality, treating each other with respect, courtesy, understanding and compassion. Anyone wishing to share something has the opportunity to do so, with no participant monopolising the group\u2019s time. The group allows each participant to speak without interruptions and side conversations. Everything said there, stays there, following the prime rule of confidentiality which must be respected and observed by all. This rule is only lifted when a member declares that it intends to do harm to himself/herself or to others.\nIt is OK to share, but whoever doesn\u2019t want to, is not obliged to do it. We are all equal, and no distinctions are permitted on the basis of gender, race or age. Everyone has the right to their own opinion and tries not to impose the accuracy or uniqueness of these views. We use the \u201cI\u201d language (or \u201cI message\u201d), we don\u2019t teach, command or advise others. We only share our experiences, ie. \u201caccording to my own experience, it is very helpful to\u2026\u201d rather than \u201cwhat you should do\u2026\u201d\nThis is not a program based on the \u201c12 step\u201d principle (ie. Alcoholics Anonymous). MAZI holds that each person has the knowledge and ability to find his personal path to \u2018cure'. Hence, the groups are not based on any particular theoretical approach, except the value of established self-help and peer-support in a safe and non-critical environment. \nFrom October 2014 until April 2016, MAZI\u00a0participated as\u00a0main partner in the program ''Citizens against depression\".\u00a0The Programme aimed to strengthen civil society and enhance the contribution of NGOs to social justice, democracy and sustainable development.\u00a0This project was\u00a0funded by the Greek NGO Programme \u201cWe are all Citizens\u201d which is part of the EEA & Norway Grants for Greece.", "created_at": "2017-05-22 17:52:38", "updated_at": "2017-05-22 17:52:38", "tag_id": 1140, "post_id": 751, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 718}, {"id": 9968, "text": null, "quote": "One question that crosses my mind: how much of this is penetrating within the non-creative spheres as side-effect of the creative turn, the requirement for creativity, the curated self, etc.?", "created_at": "2016-11-25 21:25:27", "updated_at": "2016-11-25 21:25:27", "tag_id": 1445, "post_id": 32270, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 647}, {"id": 8569, "text": null, "quote": "I really enjoyed reading this article and I find familiar to me some\u00a0of your influences (the Tumblr users, I\u2019ll check out the others at some point)!

I had never exposed myself or talked about my feelings. As time went by I got better and better at it. A very good listener my friends called me. Even today I still find myself shifting the subject of the conversation whenever it gets to me.\nI tried to act like I was Ok, or maybe I was just not aware. I had an eating disorder and a sleeping disorder and it got pretty bad at some points. Almost every night I'd stay in bed awake waiting\u00a0for my family members to go to sleep, then I'd storm the fridge eating like 4 hungry people, go back to bed feel horrible and couldn't fall asleep.\nI lived like that for many years, sometimes it was better sometimes worst. I can't tell what drove into seeking help but around the age of 22 I told my mother I think I need help. She was very happy that it came from me rather than her as she was thinking the same.\nI started\u00a0going to therapy. It took me nearly 4 months to gain the trust I needed to open my heart but with time my therapist and I became closer and through our conversations I slowly began to understand what my life was missing: love, family and friends. Yeah I've had my loving family, a few friends and a number of short romances but none of it real because I didn't allow it to be, I've never been me.\n4 years later I'm studying industrial design and doing Erasmus in UdK Berlin.\n\nAs part of our human centered design course \"Hacking Utopia\", my partner Pauline and I are focusing on the challenge how we might boost each other's mental and spiritual resilience. After posting here story to Edgeryders, our team member Nele was recommended in a comment to watch Brene Browns Ted talk, The Power of Vulnerability. We have found it so inspiring, it was exactly what we were talking about.\nAt the moment we are trying not to have any idea of how our product will look like so that we can have a neutral research and hopefully a surprising result, but we are looking in the direction of a design intervention that will encourage people to be vulnerable and share their feelings with their loved ones.\n\nBoth Pauline and I went through therapy and we both agree that what was missing in our lives was the ability to share our difficulties with our close ones. We discovered that both of us had to use objects in order to speak to our therapists. I had to put a cushion over my knees and Pauline was always keeping her hands busy by playing with hair bands or ripping pieces of paper, avoiding eye contact.\nWe were wondering whether you might have made any similar interesting experiences/observations to share with. Do you feel comfortable sharing your feeling with others? Can you get people to open up to you?\nWe are trying to gain insight on what kinds of stressors people find difficult to talk about and how we might make it easier for people to overcome shame and share their feelings, drawing inspiration from any culture, any time.\nAlso, if you have any other Ideas, thoughts, articles, projects, products or whatever you think can inspire us further please let us know.\nThank you so much for reading so far,\nTeam JUS.\nP.s. - We really liked this short video and wish we could make a sofa that feels as good as the hug in the picture above.", "created_at": "2017-01-22 22:36:45", "updated_at": "2017-01-22 22:36:45", "tag_id": 1140, "post_id": 678, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 645}, {"id": 8571, "text": null, "quote": "\"Some may call it depression.

With hindsight it has been a better choice for me than spending a fortune I don\u2019t have on having a shrink try to figure out what is the matter with me\u2026and how to fix it.\nLast week, the sadness returned.

I consider myself privileged to be born into a comfortable middle class life, to have a supportive family and friends, no academic problems. In theory, I was supposed to be happy. So why was I feeling so paralysed and helpless? Considering there are so many people who have it much worse than me, feeling sad seemed irrational, unjustified and shameful.\nEveryone around me seemed to manage just fine, effortlessly juggling scholastic and social expectations. So I thought it must be my fault that I was barely holding it together. I was ashamed to admit that I was struggling and ask for help. When I finally gathered enough courage to talk openly about my problems with my friends and family members, I was stunned how much it resonated. Once I had shared my troubles, many of them would admit some of their own. These were people that I had known for more than 10 years, people that I thought I knew inside out, suddenly telling me about insecurities of theirs that I never even suspected them to have. Such moments of connection were a very special experience.\nHowever, at times it was also exhilarating. It's not easy for either party.\u00a0Opening up, even to the people I trust most,\u00a0took a great deal of mental effort. Then, I didn\u2019t know how to properly express what I felt. And they didn\u2019t know how to react. I didn\u2019t know what kind of reaction I was hoping for. I didn\u2019t want to burden or worry anyone. How often did I find myself alone in my room bawling my eyes out, finally calling my mother or my best friend, just to hang up 5 minutes later even more frustrated and miserable and guilty than before. They were only trying to help me to the best of their abilities, but somehow all well-meant compliments and advice only made me feel worse. I didn\u2019t think they could truly understand me and it was so difficult to communicate what I wanted to say, when I didn't even\u00a0really know what that was myself. When they tried to relate their own experiences to mine, it felt like they were comparing a broken arm to a papercut. When they were trying to give me tips on health and well-being, it felt patronizing, as if I didn\u2019t know and try that already. This was nothing that doing a round of Yoga or 8 hours of sleep or being more social could simply \u2018fix\u2019. Just thinking such things added to my guilt and shame, because it was like I was taking their attempts of help for granted. Devils circle.\nWhat helped me most in the end wasn\u2019t necessarily talking about anything in those situations. Discussing these things with a neutral person such as a therapist was a much better framework for me to sort out my thoughts without the added complications of emotional attachment. The greatest help for me was just someone being there and giving me a hug. Telling me that they know it sucks and just sharing a little bit of the suckiness in that moment.\nEDIT:\nHow do\u00a0you deal\u00a0with emotional issues?

When I hear myself describe to them what we do in our courses (like dressing up and dancing around cardboard sculptures of alien Christmas trees), I sometimes find it difficult to take myself seriously. However, as most people that work in a creative field would probably tell you, it really is stressful. Being creative is intense. Apart from the financial uncertainty and competitiveness that tend to run in these professions, the work itself is very demanding, mentally and emotionally. It is very easy to become personally invested in a project, some might even call this is a necessity. Because they are so closely intertwined, it is often difficult to separate between the professional and the personal. How does this affect the way we deal with issues of mental and emotional wellbeing in this context?\nIn Product Design, we are constantly brought to question our surroundings, our decisions, and most importantly, ourselves. There has been a crisis point in almost any project where this turned into seriously doubting myself and hating all the work I had done. Sometimes, it led to absolute public meltdowns. To me it is a strange and uncomfortable feeling to share such intimate moments with people I work with.\nMany of my friends that study creative subjects have told me about similar experiences in their lives, particularly about struggles with insecurity and stress of varying degrees. Are these emotional strains simply an occupational hazard that we as creatives have to accept? Are they something we should embrace, something we actually need to produce meaningful work? There seems to be a romanticized idea of the tragically ailed, mad genius, based on the stories of countless artists like van Gogh or Beethoven that produced some of their best work during periods of Depression or Hypomania. Joshua Walters proposes in his Ted Talk \u2018On being just crazy enough\u2019, that those suffering from mental conditions might just be more sensitive to the world than others and that we can use our \u2018skillness\u2019 to our advantage. Many scientific studies suggest in fact, that there is a link between creativity and mental illness. One theory is that those with strong creative inclination perceive the world with a heightened awareness and tend to be more reflective and ruminate in their thoughts.\nFor me, a host of questions and problematics arise out of this.

Concepts themselves are its nodes; two concepts are linked if\u00a0they are in the same exchange.\u00a0\nPerson-to-person conversation networks tell us who is talking to whom.

The idea is worth pursuing, the technology is there. First it was a technical motivation, afterwards it was clear that insulin was a social and economical issue. \n\nMany people don\u2019t have access, it\u2019s bad in the US. Only a few companies have the oligopoly on production globally (US, France, Denmark based).\n\nThere\u2019s also the fragility of the supply chains. Only major producers in the West, which means that supply is easily disrupted in less developed or accessible regions. We need to rely less on shipping insulin around and maintaining eg. a cold chain. This is a major barrier to getting insulin out where it needs to be. In short, we need to decentralise production.\n\nScience and engineering:Went through one proof of concept iteration in an E. coli bacteria (for troubleshooting methods). Took about a year. We made a precursor protein to insulin. Bacteria however is not able to convert the precursor into insulin, so since early 2017 we\u2019re looking at yeast, because that organism can do everything inside the organism. The protocol needs to be simple and easily reproduced.\n\n6 months - 1 year we will have engineered the strain that does everything. Then we can move to using the strain and producing or scaling up. So the question is now: how do we structure the legal entities to govern the production.\n\nTeams from Ghent (ReaGent) and Sydney (BioFoundry) joined the project. International collaboration is unfolding. We need to organise this better and set up some legal frameworks for sharing the IP that gets generated, keeping the goals of the project in mind, we want to have a commons framework. Allowing entities to use it, but making sure that they do so in keeping with commons principles. \n\nThe organisation needs to ultimately be accountable to diabetes patients. It can\u2019t be a misalignment like we have now with the large producers that mainly have a large profit motor. They just keep diabetics dependent, charge high prices, and don\u2019t innovate much otherwise. Prices went up by 1000%, even though production got cheaper.\n\nMany semi-independent manufacturing efforts that are localised, but sharing knowledge. A [diabetes] patient coop would be able to decide how much effort to put into prevention or researching cure vs manufacturing.\n\nThe FDA is the biggest player in making this a reality. Big part of this is making a rigorous case and showing the costs of illness and the benefits of our alternative. Depending on how their own incentives work, they might not care. \n\nWe have 2 goals, proposal is to split in two groups:\n\n1. How do we move from here to this cooperative?\n\nA cooperative as a platform where patients would be the main stakeholders.The patent is not to stop other people from doing it, but to protect the \n\nCharacteristics of the agreement:\n\nRate of profit determined by patientsWhere it is invested is determined by patients.\n\nExample of medical cannabis cooperatives. Maybe we can use it as a template for our organisation. Tailor this to the local jurisdiction. \n\nWe need some kind of global scale organisation that holds the IP in custody. Perhaps a Swiss foundation. A public benefit corporation.\n\nForging alliances with city governments. Show that production at city scale is feasible and show that economic implications they have can be addressed. Eg. problem of people going to emergency rooms, which is a cost for the city, so open source insulin would make the hospital work better.Lucas Gonzales. Epidemiologist. His job is to prepare for flu pandemics in the canary islands. As part of preparing the plan, he found out there\u2019s 8000\u2019s diabetics in the CI and there is no capacity on the island (comes from Germany). So in case of pandemic, they are screwed. This could be an angle.\n\nSynthetic pancreas people. Firewall of FDA and then they appealed to free speech. They don\u2019t sell, yet share the schematics. \n\nMake it look less like a market transaction, and more like a club: participating in the testing. \n\nAnalogy to Open Source Ecology. Centralized body of knowledge, localized operation to build machines by doing workshops etc. \n\n\nChris Cook:\nAt the global level: memorandum of understanding, but otherwise you\u2019re free to do what you want.\n\n\nUnincorporated association:Agreement, but not in any legal form. 2 pager. For very early stage funding. Like a club. People have an account in the name of the club. This could be global from day 1, with members. It has a \u2018hatching clause\u2019 which makes it hatch into an actual legal form. \n\nAction items:\n\n\nReview relevant structures\nPitch this to city governments (Milan next month, Oakland, Ghent)\nHave a legal structure, so that funders know where their money goes\nCali cooperative weed\nCooperatives in calif and europe (Switzerland? Winnie\u2019s contact Malcolm Bain? European Cooperative Association)\nCentralized holder of IP\n\n\nReview the agreement of Chris.\n\nHave an inside trusted partner when you pitch this, so that\u2019s it\u2019s not 50 50 in they liked it not. Clear action plan with timelines. Open to input. Jump in early for a premium. Weigh the pro\u2019s and con\u2019s of premium. Winnie can talk about it with the head of strategy for the City of Ghent.\n\nIn Oakland: never got to the head, always mid or low level managers. You need to get people in power to not necessarily endorse it, but mainly not stop it. An endorsement would really help though. A paragraph and collect signatures of \u2018innovation, super cool project\u2019. \n\n2. How do we do international collaboration?\n\n\nWinnie:\n\nPeople are disgusted by how biotechnology industry works. Morally it\u2019s not okay that people are taxed so much money. We started a collaboration in March between Oakland, Ghent, and Sidney. It was hard to get access to information - where are the best practices documented. The team in Oakland was spread thin, so this makes it hard to scale internationally. Coincidentally it became good to collaborate, but no investment to find sinergies, for example split the experiments between groups.\nWe\u2019ve been in touch online only, and visiting helped a lot to develop trust, despite calling on skype every 2 weeks.\nTwo key problems:\n\nDocumentation and\nTrust\n\n\n\n\n\nGaby:\nIs it a problem of infrastructure - better tools, better software, or about changing the culture?\n\n\nWinnie:\n\nIt\u2019s about developing the habit of documentation - so valid because it enables more groups to work on it. We lack the scalability - we cant involve new groups since it\u2019s going to be very bumpy.\nNo platform for documentation yet.We should have a method of getting everyone on board, in difft timezones and geographical points?\nThomas: What is the patients\u2019 perception?In Belgium, the insulin is covered by the government, so not many incentives to participate among that group. The motivation here is the biotech industry.\n\n\n\n\nCindys:\n\nBuild on an existing community that has thousands of people in it, and not take on the burden of building a new platform.The Public Lab community - good for discussion and file sharing, and replicability.\nAttend the barnraising and do a workshop there? \n\n\n\n\nMatteo:\nReplicability across countries: there is a lack of culture of open science and a knowledge gap in biology.A transnational cooperative system funded by a big donor which fosters development in underdev countries? The path from need to solution is longer there - building trust, community building takes more time.\n\n\nWinnie:\nIdeally find a big donor but with niche interest locally/ in a region. The community coordination and interface needs to be funded too - i.e. the Oakland team is more focused on the research itself.\n\n\n\nCindys:\nPublic Lab has developed frameworks to use - to create a context and make sure it feeds back and then it is championed, took forward by the organisation.\n\n\n\nGaby:\n\nLearning to do science by sharing information, many times tacit. But you either have to think of the role of the person making this, or have an incentive - a place where we give recognition where people actually see it and appreciate the value.\nGroups back together\nA platform cooperative as a club insulin: the insulin users and platform service provider (management, quality control). A global framework in which local production can put its roots in local jurisdiction.

My partner, Hassan, comes from Syria and also had to cross the Aegean Sea. Last year, when I saw the gaps in the official structures for refugee \u00a0relief, I decided to create the Orange House. Many non-Greek volunteers offered to give money if I decided to build something. At first, we only thought of one room, because we didn\u2019t have a lot of cash. But then, we found this house that was not used for several months. In fact, it was an old electronics and computer shop. Slowly, I started asking for help and people got involved with all things related to opening a space that would offer human shelter. This was the beginning of the Orange House, which opened in May 2016.\nThe house has three floors, the upper one reserved for resident refugees who live inside it. They cook, clean and take care of the space by themselves. We rarely enter their space, unless some maintenance work is necessary. On the ground floor, there is a common space for everyone, which hosts several classes and sessions: from yoga to music, salsa dancing, and movie screenings. We use the half-basement, as a classroom for language classes, including Greek, English, Spanish, French and German on different levels. We also have a room in which we just meet to talk with each other and other spaces for storing clothes, glasses, food, educational material, bathing towels, etc. There is a kitchen and bathroom for people to walk in, a courtyard and a simple roof garden to grow vegetables in self-made contained made of old cargo palettes. The Orange House hosts a specialized 2-hour LGBT program for refugees every Monday, also visited by a guy from an Athens checkpoint to meet and offer help to the community.\u00a0\nOur house is open for visits by NGOs, artists, gardeners and everyone who wishes to offer creative inputs, such as salsa, music classes, or just brainstorm on what we can do better. It is hard to say how many people visit the common space. Some people come for a specific activity like a lesson in German or French. Some other women bring their kids for all day long. Volunteers can also attend classes and other activities, which are offered totally free. However, we are planning to be able to make some items to sell, such as cooked food or jewelry made by some of the residents. Our idea for the future of the house is that the refugees in collaboration with the wider community will be able to generate their own money through the skills they have and develop. For example, we have some women with a talent for cooking, hairdressing, and Arabic calligraphy. The idea is that one day all this will evolve to a social enterprise, where residents in the Orange House will be their own boss.\nThe operations of the house are managed by the community. For example, an Iranian woman is teaching someone else to do jewelry. Same goes with all housekeeping, like cooking and cleaning.\u00a0\nWe now want to register as a legal entity, in order to be able to manage funds. At the moment, I am renting the house under my name, paying 1000 euro for a monthly rent, and another 1000 for utility bills. The volunteers of the Orange House usually bring some cash and then we ask it they can change that lamp, or cover some other cost. We always have one volunteer sleeping inside the house, and we have a schedule of who is coming and for what reason. There are no public authorities or institutions involved in the project. We are just like that. Mohammed, one of the board members, works as a doctor for Doctors of the World and brings useful information about persons that need shelter. Some other NGOs also visit us to see in there are any needs.\u00a0\nPeople usually appreciate what we do and the way we do it. When I tell them \u201clook at me, I am Greek-French and I look like this\u201d. Or when they see me together with my Syrian partner. I am Christian and he is Muslim, and some people think that this is something strange. But we know how to laugh about it, and tell them that these refugees are not terrorists or criminals, but humans like everyone else.\nWhen we first entered the house in May 2016, the place was so dirty and so many things were in need of repair. I knew since the beginning that it will be a lot of work, that I will need to work two weeks full time to get everything going. But this was not true at all because it takes much more time than I initially thought. Together we are taking very good care of our space. No alcohol, smoking or drugs are allowed in the Orange House. We check who is coming in and the neighborhood feels reassured. When people see refugees doing a yoga or salsa class, they have a different image of them. Instead of seeing the of misery, like on the Lesbos island or other camps shown on TV, we show that we grow happiness and care for the community. When we started, we noticed that most people don't know how to speak a language other than theirs. This is why we called the place \u201cOrange House\u201d because the word \u201corange\u201d sounds similarly in Greek and Arabic. We also painted the house in orange color, so people coming for the first time can distinguish it easily. At the beginning, the biggest problem was bureaucracy. I didn\u2019t know whom to address to get information on how to set up an organization. Someone suggested a lawyer, but I am still waiting for the paperwork since two months. We didn\u2019t face any conflicts with the legal system because we are very careful of what we do inside the house. We brought engineers, social workers, and another expert to advise us and ensure that what we do is not something illegal.\nWhen we were almost done with all the work, I posted a poster in Greek, explaining to neighbors that what they see is the preparation of a house and school for refugees. We made a house-warming party, and we invited everyone to join, see for themselves and ask questions. This is a process of building trust. At the end of the day, there was only one neighbor that came to ask. Most people simply don\u2019t care, otherwise, we could have more reaction. The house currently hosts 15 residents. We can only accept up to 20 persons because we only have 3 bathrooms, which is the major limitation. We explain to everyone that they must contribute to housekeeping, participate in the training programs and that it is important that we share everything. We cannot be with someone that wants to be alone in the bedroom, for example. It is not possible for us. There are about 50 people that visit the Orange House to receive some sort of service. For example, a 16-year-old who is very lonely and comes just to speak with others. Many of our visitors are staying in squats, camps of other shelters where conditions are not very good, but they come to the house because they like the atmosphere. When a visitor comes we offer tea, we talk and listen, but also sing and dance. It is really like a house, not like a social service type of place.\u00a0\nResidency is only open to women and children, but male visitors are also welcome to join in the activities. Most of the male refugees arrived earlier, so the majority of the people arriving now in Greece are women and children. Quite often, we have women that have suffered some sort of abuse. We have listened to some very tough stories. Most of the volunteers are refugees themselves, or people coming from abroad and then going back home. Many people think volunteers need only shelter and food. But the reality asks for the development of real skills, to help them integrate into the society, but also have some fun. It is hard to find people that are not skilled to refugee care, but they have specific skills. What we need to have is a salsa or a hip hop teacher, or somebody that can help with the roof garden. For example, one of my friends is an electrician and is coming to do maintenance work in the building, for free.\nAnyone entering the house as a resident has to commit to attending 5 classes per week. Therefore, there is at least one activity taking place in some of the spaces every day. Sometimes, we organize outdoor activities, like hiking excursions. Refugees that benefit from the training programs at the Orange House are progressing their social skills very fast in. When a mother with a 17-year-old son arrived in May they spoke Farsi. They are now speaking fluent English. This is because everybody is connected through some sort of social action. The transformations we observe, offer some very important lessons. One of them is about the importance of patience, even when you are passionate about something. Starting a community of care is like planting a tree, and needs time to develop. There are times that you see things going wrong and always question what doesn\u2019t work. But, actually, it is important to not give up and say that you have to try again. That you will tease many people, but at the end, it will work out. Over time, I am learning how to be more grateful for every progress that is happening inside the house. Any positive impact is important.", "created_at": "2016-09-18 16:55:12", "updated_at": "2016-09-18 16:55:12", "tag_id": 1150, "post_id": 533, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 500}, {"id": 8700, "text": null, "quote": "The first part of the event consisted in a kind of intense briefing of the situation in countries closest to Syria. In a short time the populations of small countries in the region, Lebanon and Jordan, have grown manyfold (1.1 Million refugees in Lebanon, 630,000 in Jordan - in addition to Palestinian refugees already there). Some reading materials with up to date, detailed information:\nArmenia:\u00a0Anna\u2019s report from Yerevan is a good introduction.\u00a0\nJordan: Five Years On | Syria Crisis-related needs and vulnerabilities in Jordan. \u00a0\nWhile many of the cities and towns receiving refugees face similar challenges there is a significant difference. Some are transit locations, which asylum seekers pass on their way on to other destinations. They include major cities in Greece, Italy and Turkey, as well as small coastal towns from which people leave on boats to take their perilous journey across the sea. There, volunteers do their best to care for their immediate physical needs and the mandated administrative/security procedures to grant them entry onto the mainland.\nOther cities and towns \u00a0are receiving the newcomers on a more long term basis. This happens in two different phases, each one posing its own \u00a0political, administrative and infrastructural challenges for the hosting communities. The first one is the period of time between arrival and the approval or rejection of the person\u2019s application for refugee status. This period could be very long, as in the case of the Palestinian refugees in Jordan, or that of Mr. Teferi in Norway. The second one is the period that begins once an individual has secured refugee status. In this period, the challenge is navigating the difficult period between receiving the papers and being fully established in the social and economic life of the host new community.\nWhile the details differ, the problems and needs mentioned by mayors, NGOs and activists fall into one or more of the following:\n\nResource efficiency: How to get better at covering necessities of both refugees and citizens/ residents on very limited resources? As an example Jordan is one of the most water scarce countries in the world and 70 per cent of the population suffers from inadequate water supply below the national standard of 100 liters/person/day. Aging infrastructures, inefficiencies in operation and maintenance. interrupted provision of water services etc. Could resource scarcity be mitigated through Open Source technologies for recycling of sewage, seawater desalination at scale, deep drip irrigation etc? Affordable, modifiable technologies are required to manage the current crisis as well as to secure peace in the region.\nInteroperability, knowledge transfer and Institutional memory: I heard many calls to \u201cmake information available about how the system works\u201d, and \"calls for online platforms to fix a perceived\u00a0lack of information\" thought to be a \"key obstacle for labor market access\". Here too I head that \u201cwe need a database of all the initiatives and resources available to help refugees\u201d and \"we need to make existing information about getting your paperwork done, how to set up a new business etc\".\u00a0There are\u00a0three underlying assumptions: 1) That some people understand in detail \u201chow the system works\u201d as a whole and 2) That they can transmit that kind knowledge into brochures or documents and that 3) This information material will make the system navigable and penetrable for newcomers. These three assumptions do not hold up to scrutiny and could fill an entire blogpost with reasons as to why. For now I will simply refer you to the Brickstarter report as it is a light, beginner-friendly introduction to some of the issues.\nScalability of public services: How to build/rethink provision of public services so that they can accommodate changes in the number of people to serve? Many of the participants complained about the lack of resources to provide education or training for newcomers. Others mentioned the provision of health and social care services, especially psychological support for the traumatised. I heard a lot of calling for more resources to be put into existing services, but little examination of how existing services are performing and even less awareness about more effective, flexible and cost-efficient approaches. Are we sure that throwing money onto more of the same will result in better outcomes? \u00a0Sugata Mitra\u2019s work on Minimally Invasive Education, Miguel Chavez\u2019s experienced from\u00a0building Makerspaces in Favelas, Freifunk and many others offer alternative approaches with promising results. The political will, and practical ability, to welcome and accommodate newcomers depends on it. In this recent talk, I present a proposal for how we can break out of the zero-sum thinking in the provision of care services as an antidote to rising social tensions between social groups.", "created_at": "2016-09-18 20:23:51", "updated_at": "2016-09-18 20:23:51", "tag_id": 1150, "post_id": 5234, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 5201}, {"id": 8701, "text": null, "quote": "Four years ago, as we were planning our move to Brussels, Nadia and I decided to look for flatmates. Most of our friends and family members were rather puzzled: not many couples decide to share their apartment, though they can afford not to. We, however, thought it completely logical. Nadia is Swedish and I am Italian: at the time we lived in Strasbourg, France. That made us a migrant nuclear family, completely cut off from the network of emotional and material support that our friends and families of origin could offer. We were simply too isolated in our Strasbourg apartment, nice though it was; and we decided to try something different. So, we rented a much bigger apartment than we needed and asked the Internet for someone to share it with.\nFour years on, we think the experiment worked. For the last three years we have been living with Kasia and Pierre, a young couple of expatriates (Kasia is Polish, Pierre French). We really enjoy the co-habitation: the home feels more animated, and not a day goes by that we don't chat at least a little bit, over coffee or breakfast. We enjoy the big, airy living room overlooking the city. And, frankly, we appreciate that our lifestyle is really good value for money: thanks to the economies of scale implicit in family life, we pay a reasonable rent for a really nice space.\nAlong the way, we discovered that what makes our living together so enjoyable is that we are so different from each other. We come from four different countries; we are of different ages (Pierre, the youngest, is 19 years younger than me, the oldest); we have very different jobs (Kasia is a dental nurse, Pierre is the manager of a fashion boutique, whereas Nadia and I both belong to the \"what is it that you do, again?\" tribe); Nadia and I travel a lot, whereas Kasia and Pierre tend to be in town most of the time.\nThis works well on many levels. On a purely practical level, when we travel we love the thought that the home is not empty, and in the event of some misfortune (think plumbing failure) they can intervene; and I am sure they enjoy the privacy and the extra space. We pay for electricity, phone and the Internet, they pay for the cleaning services \u2013 less paperwork to do. We have an extra room, which normally serves as Nadia's and my office; but it doubles up as a guest room for the guests of all of us.\nBut there is more to co-habitation than practicality. Kasia and Pierre are lovely people: and, crucially, they are different people from Nadia and myself. We live out the city in different ways. We have different takes on almost everything, from French politics to Belgian beer. Comparing notes with them is always interesting, and I really value their insights and wisdom. Not that we spend all that much time together. I think our co-habitation unfolded in the right sequence: we started by a default attitude of rigorous mutual respect of each other's privacy and spaces. Then, over time, we grew closer, started to share the occasional meal, the occasional outing; we met each other's friends and families, lovely people to the last one. Guess what: we have built a sort of familial-like arrangement in a foreign city, among people who were originally complete strangers to one another.\nIt's working well. So well that, when a year ago our landlord announced that he was reclaiming his apartment and we would have to move out in the summer, we decided to stay together, and to look for a new place as a four-people household. Eventually, we got more ambitious and thought, what the hell, we might as well grow the family. If four people can live so well together in a larger apartment, how would it work with five, or six, or seven in an even larger one?\nIt works well, it turns out. We moved to a lovely loft, and were joined by a third couple (Belgian-Italian). Giovanni and Ilaria have since moved on for family reasons, but we enjoyed their company while we lived together. Their place has been claimed by Thomas, a young French engineer.\u00a0\nWe do this for totally egoistic reasons: we enjoy each other's company, we save money, we live in style. At the same time, we are aware that we are working our way through solving a global problem. Planet Earth has 230 million international migrants; intra-EU migrants like us are 8 million. Many of Europe's young people simply cannot afford to hold their ground: their work, education paths, and love lives lead them to migrate. When they do, they, like us, lose their supporting networks, and it is really hard to rebuild them. Living together, especially in diversity \u2013 the older with the younger, the sporty with the mobility-challenged, the academic with the blue-collar worker \u2013 becomes a platform for sharing our different abilities, and being able, as a household, to solve many different problems, both emotional and practical.\nNone of this is new. You have heard it all before \u2013 at social innovation conferences and workshops, for example, and typically by people who live in middle-class nuclear families. But we have decided to walk this particular talk; it will probably not be the right choice for everyone, but it is the right choice Nadia, Kasia, Pierre and myself; and I strongly believe it might be right for many others. I encourage you to at least consider it for yourself: as more of us make this choice, the real estate market will respond, giving us more spaces suited to our particular lifestyle (in Brussels, for example, is very difficult to find large apartments with 3 or more bathrooms!).\u00a0So, who wants to join?", "created_at": "2016-09-18 20:36:28", "updated_at": "2016-09-18 20:36:28", "tag_id": 1150, "post_id": 648, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 615}, {"id": 19744, "text": "", "quote": "Polsk\u0119 opu\u015bci\u0142em prawie 9 lat temu.

Also we are inviting Institutions like Bars, Caf\u00e9s and Eventspaces be a part of our project. So for example we lead a participant to a caf\u00e9 and ask him to drink a coffee with someone. Both drinks are half priced so they get in contact by using this discound. With a growing community different app-users could match and meet to solve tasks together and have a nice experience.\nSo our app definitely is no tourist guide.

How my father was captured by the Navy. The \"re-education camp\". The second try... the good people at the boarding home they were allowed to stay at. Fellow refugee children they made friends with. Attending school in a totally foreign language at day. Learning that very foreign language in the evenings. Working - and eventually not only being able to make their own living, but being able to make another person's living as well - in other words, not only having a child, but ensuring a safe and promising future for that child.\n\nThat being told, I must confess, I couldn't imagine how it must be to find oneself in such a situation. If I don't know their needs and wishes, how could I possibly dare saying that I'm helping with whatever I think that would help them?\n\nIf a refugee wishes for work, it almost automatically seems like a matter of impossibility: \"We cannot even provide our own people with jobs, how do you think you would fit into that picture?\" Maybe, that was a misunderstanding. Maybe, what was meant was rather: \"I'm tired of sitting around all day. I want to feel useful again. I don't want to be helped only.

Also what works well is to set a clear invitation and some simple guidelines, such as the ones I described. They help the group process and give a certain structure to build up momentum.\u00a0My experiences have been diverse. I've experienced beautiful gatherings where love, depth and understanding were shared among all participants. Sometimes when the group was mixed deeply sharing also lead to some confusion as these depths were not familiar to everyone and not everyone seemed to grasp the depth of the experience of someone else. Although I think it didn't harm or shock anyone too much, I do think it may have lead to some confusion. For instance, I once went very deep receiving the talking stick and staying silent for a few minutes, all attention on me, I didn't want to \"just say something\" so I stayed present with my inner dynamics (and doubts) in front of everyone. Finally, I said something that felt true to me. So I remained connected to my inner truth. The woman who was sitting next to me didn't know how quick she had to say something when I gave her the talking stick. Ever since our contact between me and the woman have been somewhat weird. Coming to think of it, I should have probably talked to her sometime and exchange perspectives lightly....  (oops).\u00a0\n\nThis particular meeting was organized by a friend of mine btw and was a gathering of about 20 people, which is quite big for such a sharing. I'd say depending on the size of the group there will be different forms and formats that suit best the conversation. Not necessarily the bigger the group to more superficial. Groups can go very deep together when they are guided properly. This is a true art. And ideally, one question/ sharing leads to another, being able to deepen the conversation coming closer to opennings. And, maybe most importantly everything is good. So not resisting anything nor having an agenda helps for creating the space to be who you naturally are.\u00a0\n\nI believe the Circles of openness serve best around a certain theme that is loaded and which everyone has experiences with: I organized a series about money and I participated in one about sexuality. Both topics lead to a very vulnerable and warm sharing and brought everyone closer together. Also I think Circles work well for existing communities that work or live together, as tensions may arise during the daily practices. The latter I have some experiences with at the Synergyhub and the principle we used was to share from what's alive in you at the moment. This worked pretty well.\u00a0\n\nI also initiated a circle once during a workshop where people didn't really know each other and there wasn't a real theme or topic. In that setting it didn't feel really appropriate to do a sharing, as apart from being human and sharing a similar human experience (so there's always (some) interest), \u00a0there wasn't really a common intention or relevance to have this talk together. So I wouldn't organize a circle \"out of the blue\" again.\u00a0\n\nMost of the meetings I was with had both familiar people and strangers. As long as the intention for the meeting is clear, it's no problem and good examples will follow.\u00a0\n\nMost circles I went to lasted for about 1 to 2 hours. Although probably you know about retreats/ satsangs for instance with Bentinho Massaro that take about the whole day (with sessions of about 1,5 to 2 hours each). Have to say that during these days Bentinho (or some other \"teacher) is the one who does most of the talking. Yet, he knows how to bring a group into depth. So, even though it's a different form, there's also huge transformation happening during these meetings.\u00a0\n\n@Nadia about organizing this at The Reef. I would say a circle is very appropriate and effective if there is a theme or topic that has great interest. When this is the case, we can do it. You could also guide it yourself if you feel excited.\u00a0\n\nAnd is there a learning curve, @Noemi ? Yes, for me personally very much. Through sharing so openly in a public space among others really gave me confidence to be vulnerable and fully present. Also for many others I feel sharing with each other has this effect. During some of my meetings I really saw people transform, releasing some of the doubts and limiting beliefs they had about themselves! Truly magical to be there when that happens! Moments I have very exciting and warm memories of.\u00a0\n\nSo let me summarize my experiences:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nSharing from personal experiences - yet not getting caught up into the story. The aim is to gain clarity to let go of stories and have space te create the new.\u00a0\nCircles work well around certain (loaded) theme's and communities who work/ life together with a clear invitation.\u00a0\nListening from the heart, listening from beyond the personal perspective (not taking anything personal)\nEverything that pops up from a genuine sharing is welcome, even if it's off topic.

I was helping to build shelters, but i was also a little scared for myself:\u00a0my safety, my equipment, 'getting the job done correctly'.

Also we would like to share the other surprising insights we have gained so far. Maybe they are helpful to one or the other and maybe some of you would like to contribute. What are your thoughts on and what is your interpretation of all this? We would be very thankful for any comments!\nTo first introduce us: We are a group of 4 university students from Berlin, three product designers and one socio economic communication designer and call ourselves \u201cA Taste of Home\u201d. How we came up with the name and the following design question, I will tell below:\n\u201cHow can we help newcomers to use public spaces to their full extend because they do not know which activities are legal in these spaces and do not want to act against the law?\u201d\nTwo month ago we went into the field asking ourselves \u201cHow can food preparation contribute to make people on the move feel at home and include other people living in this \u201cforeign\u201d country?\u201d Amongst others we ended up talking to one 24 year-old guy from Syria and one girl from Korea about the same age. One had to flee home and the other moved for love.\nBoth of them are living in a caring environment. One in a shared flat with wonderful people (\u201clocals\u201d) who are all very closed to each other and the other together with her boyfriend who originally is from Germany. After having found out about this we dropped the second half of our starting question \u201c[\u2026] and include other people living in this \u201cforeign\u201d country?\u201d , because we did not see this need anymore. They are already sharing their everyday life with \u201clocals\u201d, therefore also cooking with them. At least in this context one could say, they are well integrated. This left us with \u201cHow can food preparation contribute to make people on the move feel at home?\u201d\nIn terms of food culture we found out that it is mostly about eating as an occasion. It\u2019s about the taste, but even more about the surrounding atmosphere. The Syrian guy once got invited to the home of a Syrian family also living in Berlin for dinner. The food was \u201cyummy\u201d and \u201cIt tasted, just like it does when my mom cooks.\u201d, but what he enjoyed even more were the conversations, the way things were handled around the table. The two little boys of the family were fighting over the remote control just like he and his siblings used to do back home. There was a lot of fooling around which not just he but everyone enjoyed.\nBoth the Syrian guy and the Korean girl are still cooking dishes they know from back home, even though it never tastes as good as it does when their moms cook. They both said that they left home to early to develop great cooking skills and learn all the tricks. In Korea traditionally a woman would only start cooking by herself after her marriage. Nowadays a lot of young people are leaving the country, respectively their parents\u2019 homes, not being married and therefore without the entire knowledge. But as said before, they are both still trying and sometimes calling their mothers to ask for help. The Korean girl once even tried to sign up for a traditional Korean cooking class to improve her skills but unfortunately it was immediately booked up. Since then she has been hoping for a new opportunity. It seems that missing the food one grew up with is a good motivation to become active. Good food triggers people to do something. It is important to put the emphasis on the word something, because both of the interviewees recognized that it is also the missing time, which keeps them from cooking all the recipes they used to love back home. Some just take too much time in preparation: \u201cMaybe 4 to 5 hours.\u201d, the Syrian guy told us. Having to divide their time between work, German classes, socialising and cooking most of the days they are not willing to spent these many hours on the latter.\nBefore going on and explaining how we reshaped our design question with this knowledge in mind, I would like to share one more surprising insight we gained through the two interviews.\nTalking about food and well being the Syrian guy told us that when he had just arrived to Germany, he did not like to eat outside. It disgusted him. Not being able to see the food preparation made him feel uncomfortable. We tried to find out the reason for this, whether it was because he eats Halal, which he does or it was out of cleanliness concerns, but yet could not manage to do so. We still have to ask again. What happened here shows one of the difficulties we had conducting the interviews. The question triggered some awkwardness. This we felt, but why we were not able to tell. Was it because the subject was sensitive to the respondent and his eating customs? Was it because he did want to offend us since we were talking about German food? How can we overcome such awkwardness whenever it occurs in future interviews?\nTo go on with the process of our research I would first like to recall the reshaped design question: \u201cHow can food preparation contribute to make people on the move feel at home?\u201d It still seemed like the question was to broad to be solved in one design project. This is why we changed the target group \u201cpeople on the move\u201d to \u201cyoung migrants\u201d (20-30 years of age). We felt that the latter was more suitable for coming up with a specific design and the people we had interviewed both fit in this category. We then went back to synthesising the interviews once more and found that they were totally worth a second look. There was this whole topic of interactive food customs and traditions we yet had not paid enough attention to.\nReviewing our notes we got to understand, that for the people we had talked to \u201cfeeling at home\u201d in the context of food culture was a lot about the interactive customs and traditions which they had been surrounded by most of their lives. The Syrian guy misses the Syrian nights where as he tells everyone takes their coaches and pillows outside, drinks tea, smokes, chats and just sleeps on the streets. He told us, that this maybe does not happen in bigger towns but in villages as in smaller or medium-sized towns it does.\nThe girl told us that she is missing the Korean street food a lot. Once she tried out a Korean street food market here in Berlin, but did not like it. She went there with some friends. They wanted to have some good Korean food, chat and meet new people. It turned out to be a disappointment. It was too expensive \u2013 there was even an entrance fee \u2013 and the food was just not good. In Korea she always used to eat outside with her friends. Cooking was a family thing; eating out was for all other social events. Considering these stories it made sense to rephrase or specify our question to: \u201cHow can we enable young migrants to integrate interactive food customs / traditions they like and bring from their cultures of origin into Berlin\u2019s community life?\u201d Furthermore it was then that we came up with our group name \u201cA Taste of Home\u201d.\nIt finally was the comment of a fellow student, which led us to modify our topic to what it is about now. She told us about an interview her group conducted with three Syrian refugees. During their conversation the interviewees mentioned the huge summer barbecues they always would have had back in Syria: a lot of friends, family, a lot of food, somewhere in the nature, in a park. Having been asked if they are organising similar activities here in summertime, they denied. They thought that in Berlin it was forbidden to have a barbecue anywhere outside and did not want to act against the law seen their uncertain statuses. Still they miss them. It was this story which made us change the question to: \u201cHow can we help newcomers to use public spaces to their full extend because they do not know which activities are legal in these spaces and do not want to act against the law?\u201d\nThis question has to be considered on different levels. The higher-level question is: \u201cHow to harmonize the expectations about how to use public spaces?\u201d What do \u201cnewcomers\u201d, what do \u201clocals\u201d, what does everyone using those places want and how can the once being mutually exclusive to each other being handled? The second level is the topic of cooking on the street. Where, how and in which contexts is cooking in public spaces wanted? And last but not least the design challenge is about getting to know the legal frame and making it graspable for everyone.\nAll this is related to the fact, that there are a lot of refugees staying in camps where they do not have any opportunity to cook at all or even if they receive \u201cfood money\u201d instead of catering, they only have access to a shared kitchen. Another guy from Syria we cooked with lives in such a place. He told us, that the huge number of people who are sharing the kitchen there is often keeping him away from cooking. Though some of his friends who are living in another camp without cooking facilities sometimes join him for cooking. How can we enable them to make cooking a regular part of their lives again?", "created_at": "2017-04-15 19:34:04", "updated_at": "2017-04-15 19:34:04", "tag_id": 1150, "post_id": 506, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 473}, {"id": 8746, "text": null, "quote": "in Greece, many solidarity groups the last years have been cooking on the street for homeless or refugees.

About every month they organise a cooking event called \u201c50 shades of\u2026\u201d. This time it was spinach. They put up different cooking stations where we were welcome to help the cooks. The informal and open-minded atmosphere made conversations of all sorts very easy. Here are some pictures of the event.\nFor us the most important insight we gained is the following:\nThe Afghan women who cooked told us that they live in a refugee camp where they do not have any cooking facility and are therefore more than happy about every chance to cook elsewhere. It relaxes and enables them to act out. Every second week they meet up at the KitchenHub to cook. To feel secured it is important to them to be only a small and female group on those days. Therefore the size of the group is kept small even though there has been an increasing demand. Such places are rare and seem to be deeply needed. We are going to cook with one of them in a park to try out whether outside cooking especially in terms of privacy is an option for them as well or not.\nWe heard another related story at our experimental cooking night. Three friends from Syria joined us that day. Two of them are living in an emergency accommodation. The other one got transferred to another camp. The two former do not have access to any kitchen where they live, the latter can use the shared kitchen. From time to time his two friends even join him for cooking, because they really miss doing it.\nNot having access to cooking facilities seems to be a big issue. \u201cFood security\u201d including cooking is part of \u201cfeeling at home\u201d.

I\u2019ve worked a lot with refugees, doing legal orientation, helping them to find houses, jobs, but also writing projects to get funds to create new spaces of inclusion.\nFor me it\u2019s interesting to see how many edgeryders are interested in migration or refugee issues and what are the connections to spring up from the many well known problems of working with refugees. I think that it\u2019s possible to underline some key issues when talking about care in this context .\n\nHelping Relationships vs Peer Relationships\nKnow your rights vs Rights as a cage\nIntercultural problems and Empathy\nInclusiveness in our society/community: avoid ideological and too theoretical approach\n\nA little bit about my experience: In particular I would like to speak about my working period during the so called \u201cNorth \u00a0Africa Emergency\u201d for 3 years. It was a really hard situation for our (Italian) reception system. We were in the paradoxical situation to tell them: \u201cyou are an asylum seeker, you HAVE to be an asylum seeker, if you want to have any chances to stay in Europe\u201d.\nIn effect after the Arab Spring Revolution (2011) everything changed. A lot of people that came from Horn of Africa or from other Sub Saharian regions and were in Libya for work decided to come in Europe. Gaddafi\u2019s death meant the end of every agreement \u201cPetrol vs Migrants\u201d that Italian Government had signed with Berlusconi in 2009 (for more details, this Guardian article). So you\u2019d have more asylum seekers in Europe, but also different routes, different countries of origin, different reasons to leave their countries.\nIn 2011 asylum seekers in Italy were more than 40.000 (4 times more than 2010, Eurostat) and Italy became the fourth country for the number of claims submitted, mainly from Nigeria,Tunisia, Ghana and Mali. Most of them have lived for many years in Libya, illiterate in their own native language, living in segregated conditions of work or in the terrible detention centers.\nThe history is long and I\u2019 don\u2019t want to become boring, but only to say that it\u2019s not possible to speak about refugees in general when trying to be of real help. We have to think about the countries where we are and where they come from (for example 90% of Syrian refugees that arrived in Italy decided not to ask asylum here, but in other north EU countries), the migration routes, the particular war conditions, but also the economical ones..\nFor all these reasons it was hard to prepare asylum seekers during North Africa Emergency because they came here for Lybian crisis and most didn\u2019t leave their countries for reasons of \u201crace, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion\u201d (Geneva Convention) or for war crisis in their countries (subsidiary protection). And so it was difficult to explain them that formally they have to be asylum seekers, that we need to find these elements in their stories. How could we help them? I usually do some group or individual meetings to inform them about procedures, about what does it mean to ask asylum and I prepare them for the Audition. How to help them to underline important elements in their stories, not lying... A lot of also ethical questions..(Legislation vs Reality)\nA relation of care: teaching a foreign language\nThe relations between us is a relation of help. Sometimes you can help someone too much.\nThe question is more to create opportunities for people to be really active (refugees as #nospectators). There are language barriers, cultural misunderstandings, different contexts of life, different expectations.\nIn this complex and nonlinear context of work that I would like to start from the first point: the challenge to learn a new language, the language of the recipient country. It could be difficult and, in some situations, also impossible, like a WALL.\nThis could be because learning a language means that you accept to be in a country, you decide to start again your life. For a lot of vulnerable people that are victims of violence (in their countries of origin or during the migration travel) it could become a catalyst of bed experiences.\nSo learning a language becomes the first step to say: \u201cI\u2019m here. I would like to take part in this new society and new community.\u201d\nFor all these reasons we needed to share knowledge and experiences about \u201chow to teach in more effective way?\u201d, we needed to create a community - or better to create a space for a community of italian schools! So we started with: www.milano.Italianostranieri.org\nIt is a platform of the Municipality of Milan to help foreigners find a school of Italian; there are a lot of problems to find the right schools, also because there are a lot of schools but not connected.\nWe saw that there is this tendency to work alone, providing a service but without \u00a0sharing knowledge, critical points.. We knew people that attend 3 different classes, for months, \u00a0but they couldn\u2019t speak Italian!\nSo we decided to open our website to every school, private, public, run by volunteers, by NGOs.\nIt\u2019s not simple to help, to take care of someone. It\u2019s a relation full of responsibilities, and good intentions often aren\u2019t enough. We noticed also some schools that are so active in helping their students, helping them in legal stuff or finding jobs.. But all these activities could be dangerous, create a bubble, a dependence relation, mixed with ideological thoughts ..\nYour students are not yours.\nTo create a community we realized \u00a0real life meetings between teachers and schoolmakers. Every school has the possibility to post directly activities, news. So everyone can have an always updated map of time classes, levels, locations etc; But also a moment of exchange between teachers, methods and materials. The teachers all together wrote also an handbook for teachers (in Italian only). We also created an e-learning database to help people to find free resources on internet and a lot of videos (in 5 languages) to explain Laws. Education system...\n\u00a0\nI\u2019ve been asked what projects I think can really make a difference: Projects that work on the concept of resilience,\u00a0avoid that people identify themselves with their own pain.\nWe saw a lot of people that 5 or 6 months after their arrival start to fade, to turn off. During the first months you hope that your rights became effective, job, home.. But nothing happens. Your life becomes full of complaints.\nA very interesting school that is part of the community is for example, Asnada. It\u2019s a Montessori/Experimental\u00a0school. The idea is to teach in a different way. Helping people to use this new language not as a \u201cstranger\u201d language. Usually you start to have 2 languages: the native one that is the language of feelings and relationships and a second language that is the language of bureaucracy. The idea is to teach a language that helps you to construct your new identity, \u201ccreate your new life here in a new language\u201d.\nSo the lessons became a workshop where we, all together, construct the language, with different ways, methods (arts, music, plays..) and also being a community.\nSo in my opinion it\u2019s really important to be able to find new ways to take care, creating effective spaces of meeting, of real exchange.\nWork on resilience, opening workshops where people can create something (for ex. FabLabs, Makerspaces..) using open technologies (like Raspberry Pi) could become new ways to take care of people in really big troubles, with strong vulnerabilities and help them to start again.\nMaybe Opencare, Edgeryders community could be the right place where to start!!\nWhat do you think?", "created_at": "2017-04-22 22:05:38", "updated_at": "2017-04-22 22:05:38", "tag_id": 1150, "post_id": 515, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 482}, {"id": 8754, "text": null, "quote": "question\u00a0instead of the municipality.\nWhen talking about Italianostranieri you mentioned that it was useful as a coordination tool for schools - to help them come together and share knowledge.

Through our social and educational work, we try to answer a question: how can we live together taking care of our specific differences?\u00a0 Far from the identity concept, we make the most of our similarity, using the new language (Italian) as a common ground. We have opened a first school for refugees and asylum seekers and, some years later, a school for unaccompanied minors. We are now nine (eight women and a man) coming from different backgrounds (Journalism, Pedagogy, Classical Studies, Education, Psychology, Cultural mediation, Languages) and ages (from 25 to 55).\u00a0\nOur schools are the places where we try to build up familiar relationships and a sense of community, but also the place where we try to understand, together, the contradictions of the world we live in. The learning group has here an essential role because it\u2019s the context in which every single student find his place, support and the courage to express himself. The variety of writing and speaking levels we look for in the student group is meant to lead to a free and informal circulation of knowledge and language skills, creating a context where the directory of teaching is also transversal, not only vertical.\nThe language we teach is not only the language of the daily routine, but an intimate language which allows people to reshape and rename their past and present experience, together with their aspirations and future projects. In order to allow everybody to have the opportunity to express himself or herself, we don\u2019t only use the spoken and written language: theatre exercises, songs, handcraft workshops, games, silent books, pictures and images, silk-screen printing, short films are the means through which explore the new language and ourselves.\u00a0\nMontessori\u2019s instruments give an important support to the learning process, as they help reading and writing but also studying grammatical and syntactical structures. We both use original instruments (for example, sandpaper letters, movable alphabet, set analysis and grammar symbols) and readapted tools we calibrated on purpose for the whole group.\nDuring these years we\u2019ve been meeting more than six hundred people coming from all over the world. This exchange of unconscious knowledge constantly creating new ways of schooling and in these years made us organize specific projects based on students real needs or passions:\u00a0\n\nThe discover of the importance - especially for illiterate students - of learning at a slow rhythm, also thanks to practical activities, is the reason why, three years ago, we started to organize \u201cThe ground language\u201d (La lingua della terra), a class around the growing of a vegetable garden and the study of the organic agriculture principles.\u00a0\nThe comprehension of the role of the mother tongue in our life, as the skeleton of our soul, press us to find a way to support and promote all the mother tongues. So, we hold up a group of story-tellers named \u201cRoots and Branches\u201d (Radici e Rami) sharing traditional and fairy tales, poems and myths in the first languages and in Italian.\u00a0\nDue to the need to use as soon as possible the new language also in order to better understand the world where we are living, with its contradictions, injustices and opportunities, we started to explore the city not only as tourists but as researchers: recorder, camera and a set of questions are the equipment with which we walk through the city asking people we meet to share their ideas, their point of view and experience about an issue which is meaningful for all the group.\nThe importance to look at the students as men and women having resources, abilities and strength enhance equal relationships.\u00a0\n\nFrom 2016, Asnada collaborates with the groups Nuovo Armenia and Gina Films. The City of Milano has assigned to us a farmstead (Cascina) situated in the centre of Dergano, a neighbors in the north of the city, in order to build up a place where migration issues could be faced through a cultural production, developed with the foreign communities themselves.\u00a0\nOur goal is to reshape the collective perception of the migration issue with the direct experience of a possibile living together, in order to avoid the usual relationships based on charity or humanitarian help. The \u201cCascina\u201d will be the place where, besides our schools, will be held a multilingual cinema where foreign and Italian people will watch movies in original languages, but also a cafeteria (with controlled prices) and a coworking area.

One look at the map of the region is enough to understand how difficult for them it would be to access hospitals and doctors otherwise. 2500 islands sit on the Indian part of the river, which starts from the Tibetan mountains and flows through the Assam region, being a home to 3 million people, 10% of the region\u2019s population.\nThere are numerous reasons why providing these places with health care is particularly difficult: due to huge shortages of doctors in India to start with (0.7 per 1000 people), shifting territories of these islands, unstable population and difficult living conditions: they\u2019re connected to the land by boats and suffer from frequent energy and drinking water deficit. Not to mention strikingly high numbers in maternal and infant mortality.\nSanjoy Hazarika pitched the idea of floating clinics to the World Bank in 2000 and received their support - 20,000 dollars to start with. One year later the first boat sailed to bring care to the Assamese, and until today, 14 more followed. The project was eventually joined by the state, which established a public-private partnership with the trust and started funding the offered service. Each month around 20.000 people in total are reached by these facilities.\nSome of the doctors who joined the ships helped to improve their service. One of the keys to success is frequency - by ensuring that each island is visited at least once a month it is possible to take good care of immunization and condition of pregnant women. They also bring the basic medicine, which is cheap in India - but if one needs to hire a boat to get it, the costs soar.\nAnd the service provided by the boat is free - the funds provided by the state amount for 72 400 000 million rupees per year - which, after covering the costs of the boat and the staff, means that there are 480 rupees per person left. Around 5 dollars per year.\nMore about the project here: http://www.c-nes.org/programmes/boat-clinics\nPhoto comes from\u00a0http://www.tehelka.com/2014/07/boat-clinics-provide-healthcare-to-3-million-people-in-assams-river-islands/", "created_at": "2017-01-22 19:26:44", "updated_at": "2017-01-22 19:26:44", "tag_id": 1153, "post_id": 708, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 675}, {"id": 12103, "text": "", "quote": "technology of design", "created_at": "2017-11-26 21:04:01.481825", "updated_at": "2017-12-02 16:05:38.721264", "tag_id": 2488, "post_id": 37047, "creator_id": 4180, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 7198}, {"id": 19752, "text": "", "quote": "Jestem zdecydowanym ateist\u0105", "created_at": "2020-06-11 20:00:15.845073", "updated_at": "2020-06-11 20:00:15.845073", "tag_id": 5530, "post_id": 56840, "creator_id": 6484, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 9726}, {"id": 27069, "text": "", "quote": "If you haven\u2019t seen it yet, ImageNet Roulette is an excellent bit of educational/provocative art by the ever-brilliant Kate Crawford and Trevor Paglan.

And how come that trauma - such a heavy word, such a serious matter - is your passion?' That is what people ask me when they hear about my tour, about me and my bus traveling through Europe to talk and teach about trauma and to try to soften the pain of trauma. 'No, I am not on a mission (that is a far too 'religious word for me to befriend with) - and yes, trauma is my passion, and I do have a message.\nI really believe that pain should come in the open. That it should be de-tabooed: we should know more about it, understand better what traumatic pain is, how it functions, how it takes possession of us, we should be able to look at it more closely, to be with it (for a while). Trauma, pain, fear ... we'd rather not experience it or watch it happen in someone else's life. It is like with 'death': we know it is part of our lives, we all have to deal with it, and yet we don't - because it's (too) uncomfortable. How to talk about human mistreatments, heavy physical pain, profound disrespect of your person, or situations where you felt like if your life was in danger? How to share the feelings of loneliness and hopelessness that go with such pain? We often do not know how to do that, and try to ban painful events and feelings from our minds, we want to forget about it.\nIt is something in pain itself too. We're hardwired to avoid and suppress pain. It helps us survive, it helps us to go on. Avoiding, minimizing and denying pain is our most natural, short term solution to deal with pain. It is a survival mechanism. It often takes a while, from seconds to minutes, to physically feel the pain caused by an accident, a car crash or a broken leg. Not feeling the pain gives us more time to save ourselves, to get away from danger. \u00a0Out of the car, walk away and call the ambulance f.ex. On the long term, however, not feeling isn\u2019t very effective. Because it is impossible to heal from something we don't acknowledge. On the long term, suppressed pain comes back to us, like a boomerang. That is what trauma and traumatic pain is about: it is pain that doesn't seems to go away, pain that stays with us far too long, as a residue of what happened to us.\nI believe that this residual pain needs to be addressed more openly. \u00a0\nTraumatic pain can be softened - and it should be. Because unresolved trauma makes us sick, depressed and heavy-hearted. It deregulates us, deeply and on many levels: mind, heart and body. We know that traumatic pain lies at the heart of most contemporary diseases, be they mental or physical, we know that trauma adds to almost every sickness as a major contributing factor. And yet ... the knowledge about trauma and how to address it to lower its dramatic impact on our lives is far from common.\nThat is what my tour is about: I want the world to be trauma-informed.\n\n\n\n\nI want people to come and look at the pictures on the bus and ask questions. I want them to learn about trauma and realize that healing is possible. We can all learn best practices regarding talking and coping. We can all learn to calm down and regulate a body in fight, flight or freeze modus. We can all learn techniques to stop nightmares and flashbacks. We can all learn to help traumatized persons recover. It often takes not more than 15 minutes to help people sleep better: help them release tension before they go to bed, by offering a relaxing breathing exercise, or teach them to intervene in their dreams by using their imagination, by rehearsing a different ending for their nightmare f.ex.\nWe are all on a mission: to a certain degree we all need to become trauma specialists. First, we need to deal with our own trauma's and those of the people around us. We need to dare to feel and face our pain instead of running away from it. Second, there's too much suffering in the world as to leave its resolution to the clinical field or therapeutic setting. Therapeutic knowledge should be accessible to all of us, it should not be protected and copyrighted. Therapeutic knowledge should be alive in the world, not only in shrinks\u2019 offices. That is why I do what I do: share my knowledge about trauma with you, share insights, methods and techniques from the field of trauma healing ... so that we can all, together, ease and soften the pain in our world. \u00a0\nI don\u2019t know of any other projects sharing therapeutic knowledge in the way Trauma Tour does. But the idea of a trauma-informed world is related to a growing field of \u2018self care\u2019: taking responsibility for one's own (mental) health by reading self help books, attending self help groups, becoming experience experts, \u2026 It is long known that helping on this \u2018equal\u2019 level, is often more effective than any method or technique. It is also known that the relationship between \u2018therapist\u2019 and \u2018patient\u2019 is a major factor when it comes to healing. If we combine both, \u2018helping expertise\u2019 and \u2018being equal\u2019, it seems a very natural thing to come out of our offices and share therapeutic knowledge with those who suffer. It makes \u2018us\u2019 helpers and \u2018them\u2019 traumatized people equal human beings, fellow human beings.

The glove designed for proprioceptive rehabilitation and to recover movement fluidity after an injury.\u00a0 It allows the patient to record and report exercises, data- such as hand position and fingertips pressure.\nIn 2014 Sara\u00a0Savian\u00a0and Mauro Alfieri started their journey with a \u201ctest on sensors \u201cand they had presented their first prototype at the Arduino User Group & Wearables community at WeMake. The purpose for this to share projects, knowledge and create discussions on Arduino and Wearables and smart textiles.\u00a0 The intent was to explore how it can be used? How can it add value and be of use socially?\u00a0 What could be built on this foundation? These discussions could change the course for many participants.\nSara and Mauro not only had many questions answered, but they left with the idea of going back to the drawing board and creating something that would be beneficial to society.\nA conversation between a physiotherapist and someone suffering from hand disability created inquiry for Sara and Mauro. They exchanged and shared thoughts on their project, how could it be of use and that led to further discussion. It was the trigger point for them and a stepping stone for their project. We can\u2019t capture every discussion that took place as dialogue is woven into many discussions. But this one interaction planted the seed for what is now reHub.\n\u00a0We asked Sara to recollect this conversation:\nJohn: \"I suffer from a hand disability that limits my activities of daily life. Self-sufficiency is greatly reduced and hinders the quality of life for me. Constant monitoring of my movements and joints must be done frequently to evaluate my progress by and going back and forth as an outpatient for evaluations. This interferes with my daily activities\u201d*\nPhysiotherapist: \u201cThere has been an advancement in technologies in the rehabilitation to help patients achieve maximum recovery outcomes. In Italy, physiotherapists have no access to digital tools to evaluate rehabilitative progress for hand movements. Having instant access to this therapy anytime would be greatly beneficial.*\nWe asked Sara and Mauro how this conversation altered the course for reHub.\nSara: \u201cThis made us re-evaluate our project in a variety of ways and prompted us to think in broader terms and combine the \"test on sensors\" with solving a problem. We know that there is a lot of learning that needs to be done when you put the device in the hands of people that are just things you would not expect\".\u00a0\nMauro: From this discussion, Sara and I saw the opportunity offer a solution and an experience of an emerging area of wearable technology together with the sensing technology and decided to create a device that could be delivered in a rehabilitation approach to support patients\u2019 and to monitor hand rehabilitation. From listening to challenges that are faced on a daily basis, and realizing how painful it is for the patient and family. We need to work with them to help co-create with us\u201d.\nWith the project in its early stage, Sara wanted to share this:\nSara: \u201cThere is much work to do including working with actual users and receiving their feedback. With the goal of making it open source, fully customizable and adaptable, a community of user is required. We are solving the problem of monitoring the progress of rehabilitation therapy and the people directly impacted must be included.\u201d\nWe asked what\u2019s next for reHub.\nSara: \"We know that rehabilitation is time-consuming and demotivating and we plan to change that with a reHub device to empower patients through their therapy. Rehabilitation is often costly, by making it open source, it\u2019s affordable and accessible for people who are living with limitation and this could drastically improve their mental well-being during the road of recovery\u201d. This will allow the vast majority of patients to be sent home with a rehabilitation program to practice on their smartphone or tablet.\"\nThe reHub team is taking a broad approach in this area and looking for users and a community that will benefit and help develop different options: sport, gaming, educational, medical.\nWhy is it important to work with the community to further develop reHub?\nSara: \"Spending time with a community, or patients that will benefit from what you\u2019re creating is looking at the problem in a human-centered way and it highlight\u2019s what\u2019s needed instead of just relying on responses to questions. Spending time with people in the area of use is a really important step in the design process. So we\u2019re back to the drawing board. We need to know what from the user's perspective so we can design with them in mind.\"\nCo-creation, it matters. There is the emotional and functional connection that people have to a medical device. As far as functional, understanding how people use things, what they need to get done daily. \u00a0When we think of medical devices we initially think of accuracy, consistency, making sure it delivers the expected results. These are crucial reasons why design should be human oriented.\nMauro Alfieri: \u201cWe thank all the physiotherapists we have had a chance to meet with \u00a0which could effectively confront the future of this project, orienting it to a continuous use in proprioceptive physiotherapy.\"\nIf people can\u2019t achieve expected results due to a design issue or flaw, then that\u2019s obviously going to have a clinical impact. From a functional aspect, understanding how people use things does matter. This is where engineering, design and the community will benefit and need to work hand in hand to understand these components. It\u2019s crucial to consider human emotions when designing medical products. Often, it\u2019s the emotional connections that people have with respect to the design. Is it flexible? The weight, how it feels, is it aesthetically appealing?\nThen, of course, cost and accessibility that make people gravitate toward certain devices as opposed to others. With the joined forces of diverse backgrounds of Sara and Mauro, reHub will be addressing all these concerns.\nreHub-goal-oriented effective rehabilitative treatment and experience that will help patients return to family, job, community and resume regular daily activities.\nMore updates to follow.\n*The name of John and Physiotherapist have been used to maintain privacy.", "created_at": "2017-06-26 14:28:05", "updated_at": "2017-06-26 14:28:05", "tag_id": 1155, "post_id": 861, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 828}, {"id": 8796, "text": null, "quote": "Recruiting people for testing a hybrid bicycle (see here), personal experiences were confirmed: mother nature gives us ideal conditions (Milano, Italy) such as sun, no wind and flat terrain.

I am 20 years old, and currently a sophomore at Minerva Schools at KGI, California, USA. I was inspired by Monica Marcu\u2019s book, The Miracle Tree, to research with a team back in Nigeria on the blood regulatory power of the contents of the leaves of a very medicinal plant. It is a herbal plant that has just drawn a lot of attention in its potential to cure over three hundred ailments. This is the Moringa Oleifera. We experimented on Wistar albino rats. The idea was to inject alloxan intraperitoneally to all groups of Wistar albino rats with healthy working pancreas (alloxan increases blood sugar level, thus inducing hyperglycaemia or making them \u201cpseudo-diabetic\u201d). The bioactive agents of moringa leaves were extracted with ethanol and water, and two groups of the rats were treated each with these contents. An additional group was treated with synthetic insulin (insulin is a natural blood regulatory hormone that brings down blood sugar level), and all three groups were observed. We discovered that the group of Wistar albino rats treated with the bioactive agents of the moringa leaves extracted with water had a SIGNIFICANTLY SIMILAR blood sugar level as those treated with synthetic insulin, and less significant with those treated with ethanol. This unearthened two truths. First, moringa has powerful blood regulatory effects, almost equivalent to the natural insulin. Secondly, water is a better extraction agent than ethanol, unlike the case for many other plant leaves. Aside its blood regulatory power, moringa also cures diarrhea, and many other bacterial and fungal infections. It is also a healthy store for numerous nutrients, vitamins and amino acids. It also thrives very well in these tropical regions of Africa, especially the Southern Nigeria. Armed with this knowledge, I took up the entrepreneurial project of making moringa teas using tea bags because this would not only help a lot of poor people in Nigeria, and Africa in general, who cannot afford or obtain quality health care, but would be a cheap and accessible way of maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Furthermore, since water is a good extraction agent for moringa, moringa teas would provide consumers the maximal health benefits. Even though, I have not had the necessary funding and have been self-funding this project, my motivation to help people live longer and healthier has kept this dream going, and I have not tired out in bringing this to fruition. I am still conducting researches and experiments on my tea, and I have just purchased about two plots of land for moringa farming.

Is usually delegated to the patients the duty of providing the accurate information about their health condition every visit.\n\n\n\tThe missing digitalization of the gathered health data and the consequent discontinuity of the healing process.\n\n\n\tThe limited precision of the anamnestic research due to the high number of patients and the short time available.\n\n\n\n\n\tFinal User, individuals and\u00a0community target\n\n\n\n\nResQ is conceived to ease the communication among physicians (involved in critical context such as emergency hospitals and refugees reception centers) regarding the health state of foreigner patients who don\u2019t know the language of the hosting country.

Also, the digitalization of such a document would make possible an extensive sharing with colleagues that later will take care of the same patient.\n\nTherefore the physician will have the chance to communicate autonomously among themselves without misunderstanding through the management tool.\n\n\nResQ-board.jpg2045x2500 640 KB\n\n\n\n\n\n\tTechnologies we will adopt\n\n\n\n\nThe tool we are designing will be developed in order to be accessible from the main devices available on the market.

With Luca, Jacopo and Alice we started\u00a0Dynamoscopio\u00a0(\"those who observe change\"). We are a strange mix of designers, researchers, and practitioners of urban transformation. We are anthropologists, architects, economists.\nIn 2012 we got interested in a neighborhood called Giambellino-Lorenteggio, in Milan. It was undergoing change, and a tension ran through it. Its eastern end is a heavily hipsterized area, with lofts and cool parties connected with the mighty\u00a0Furniture Fair. To the west there are large industrial settlements (Vodafone Italia, for example). Line 4 of the Metro is under construction here. The value of real estate is going up, or soon will. But the neighborhood itself remains low-income, home to many marginalized people. 25,000 people here qualify for subsidized-rent accommodation. Many of them can survive only because they do live in subsidized housing. Many more would have a right to, but the city does not have enough apartments available. So they are stuck in a queue.\nThe neighborhood was (and still is) vulnerable to gentrification. It only takes a small increase in rents to price many people out of the neighborhood. We took a political stance that people should not be driven out, and moved in.\nFirst we investigated the area, and put our findings into a documentary film (trailer). As we did so, we fell in love with the local market,\u00a0Mercato Lorenteggio\u00a0(henceforth ML). This market had a problem: in 2005 a large supermarket had moved into the area. Its competition was driving many local shops out of business \u2013 including several of those in ML. It was clear that the market was on its way out.\nBy then, we had figured out that the neighborhood lacked resilience. Nonlocal Milanese never go there, and why would they? And even the locals do not form the thick web of social relationships you find in a healthy community. We knew one thing: working in Lorenteggio meant spending most of our time dragging people out of their apartments.\nWe tried to draw a sort of map of desires and problems surrounding the market. We mapped the social actors around it: the local people, the municipality, the nonlocal Milanese, the shopkeepers. The shopkeepers seemed the most promising agent of change. They are local businesspeople: if the neighborhood does well, they do well. ML itself could serve as a focal point. If we could revive it, we could show the local community that it can work its way out of a bad situation.\nSo we did several things.\n\n\nWith the shopkeepers, we redefined ML's unique value proposition. The supermarket would always beat us on price, and on opening hours. So we invented a brand we call DOP, Denominazione di Origine Popolare (People's Designation of Origin). This means local products \u2013 Milano is a farming city, with many farms to the immediate south of the city. It also mean \"new local\" products, for example we sell\u00a0teff\u00a0used in Eritrean and Ethiopian cuisine.\n \n\nWe made it clear that these businesses are the natural allies of the neighborhood. For example, we have solidarity campaigns. One is called \"Fai la spesa per la tua scuola\" (shop for your school). Shopkeepers donate part of their income to the local elementary school. Other local partners expressed interest in participating.\n \n\nWe mobilized the community on restoring the fa\u00e7ade of the ML building. A Milan-based company donated the materials; the local people contributed manpower. Physical work on the space creates ownership and mobilization. Also, it was a great party (timelapse video)!\n \n\nWe pushed the mixed use of ML as a place for culture and socializing as well as commerce. For example, we organize courses of Arabic languages (requested by many migrant families), knitting events, etc. The market has wide corridors, and can host up to 1,000 people.\n \n\nWe moved in ourselves. Dynamoscopio runs a tiny cultural space (20 square meters) inside ML. We offer wi-fi too.\n \n\nIn general, we are trying to reinvent the physical space of ML and the kind of local commerce that it offers.\nWho pays for this? We started out with grants. Milan is home to several charitable foundations, and some of them focus on the poorer neighborhoods. With time, we are moving towards a more sustainable mix of revenue streams. Even the shopkeepers, now, are chipping in: this is great, because it a sign of increased sustainability. Also, the work we do in Lorenteggio is good PR, and it helps Dynamoscopio get clients.\nWe think we are carers, in a way. We care for the community as a whole, rather than for any one person in it. \"Taking care\" in this context means keeping ML open and thriving; and that, in turn, means contributing to them getting income. The shops in ML are holding the line of the viability of the whole community.\nWe are not open by default, but we do use some of the strategies of the open source movement. Example: some migrant families from Arabophone countries wanted courses of Arabic for the children. We helped them set them up, and set them up in the market. The logic is this: if the market becomes an open platform for people to do stuff, more people will go there. This will create more business opportunities for the shops: you went for the Arabic lesson, it makes sense to do your groceries there too.\nConsidering, our work with ML is going rather well. In 2012 it was on its way out, with several shops closed: in 2016 all stalls are in use, and the market is thriving. The space has become more beautiful and welcoming.\nStill, there are many things we would like to improve. For example, last year we organized two \"swap markets\", and they failed badly. Both events were popular, with a lot of people in attendance. But these were people from outside the neighborhood, many of them hipsters. This created tension, because the locals see them as harbingers that they will be priced out of the neighborhood. Another pain point is that we are unable to monitor our impact. Shopkeepers are reluctant to disclose how much money they are making. We do not even have a system to count the number of people present in the market. We would love to have some kind of tool, but somehow this sort of work always gets deprioritized, there is so much to do.\nAlso, we are not sure how much longer we can afford to stay engaged with ML. But we worry. What happens when we stop pushing? Another example: for a while, a guy named Manuel ran a vegetable garden outside ML. People loved it. But when Manuel withdrew, the whole thing dried out. These dynamics look great, but they are not always sustainable.\nDo you know of any similar experience?

The inertia of national states behind educational institutions is failing to answer to the reality of communities that are experiencing social change at a faster than ever rate. The future we imagine cannot be reached following old pathways.\nTeenagers are left out of social life, with no appropriate spaces or other activities expected from them, apart from attending compulsory school until an age that keeps rising as the human life cycle prospers. In a phase of life characterized by passion and vocation, loads of energy and bluntness, teenagers in Europe find themselves institutionalized and irrelevant.\n\u00abFuture Tools\u00bb project is an acknowledgment of the value teenagers have for society: they hold our future in their hands. \u00abFuture Tools\u00bb is a space designed with caring attention to fit the needs of our young generation, aiming to connect them to a new world of opportunities by inviting them to work, to collaborate, to participate and to have a voice in their own community. We can now apply our knowledge about adolescence to provide a comprehensive environment in which teenagers can develop healthy social emotions, autonomous and egalitarian participation.\nProvide an alternative to corporate uses of technology through the culture of the commons; spread collaborative habits in neighborhoods; build activities rooted in intrinsic motivation that bloom in communal benefit are some of the ways \u00abFuture Tools\u00bb will engage people in fostering a society with greater equality, solidarity and sustainability.\n\u00abFuture Tools\u00bb is a common learning lab for teenagers. By offering youngster a place to gather and pursue their interests while promoting their autonomy, we aim to empower them to work for a better future. Sharing resources and interests in an alternative learning space, the culture of collaboration and the democratizing possibilities of technology, this place will have its roots in the neighborhood\u2019s daily activities and funnel the parents\u2019 interest in social promotion for their kids towards a more inclusive society.\nThe abundance of open resources that can be freely accessed through personal learning environments to learn digital skills \u2014such as computational thinking, governance software, UX design, in fact any skills that we may need to implement our projects in the world\u2014 is an opportunity, never known before to such a widespread extent, to empower our youngsters to build a better future.\nNeighboring environment\nThe neighborhood as a community comes to relevance in the task of \u00abhelping grow adults\u00bb. The age group that most closely matches the Secondary Education stage in our culture has in the neighborhood its spatial range of freedom, just one step away from the wide world they will live in as adults. Connecting these neighboring communities to the global emergence of the digital culture as makers and participants through their own teenagers is a pertinent, strengthening link between local and broader communities.\nIt is urgent for these generations of parents and offspring to leap forward over institutional stagnancy and give ourselves the shared resources we can provide for our own borough, in every neighborhood, nurturing our tribe-prone teens from the gang to the team, by building around them the common ground for community.\nIt is sometimes sad hear stating that what is being promoted for innovation in the field of education \u2014on the basis of empathic personal exchange, attention to the tempo, sensibility for intrinsic motivations, in short: the wisdom of caring for each other\u2014 are outdated methodologies. Digital tools offers a new breeze to these methodologies, an opportunity to enhance the soft aspects of learning and allow us to cast aside production-line techniques when it comes to our kids: lecturing, memorizing, exams, ringing bell schedules, curriculums and subjects.

There's so many different opinions on what is the best way of educating and each seems to have its merits. In practise there's already quite some alternatives - at least in Belgium - like Steiner and Freinet schools. My experience with those schools is limited and I have not seen miracles. How does\u00a0your philospophy\u00a0relate to the existing alternatives?\nLike @Noemi says, it's a hard case for radical changes. That's not necessarily a bad thing. There needs to be room for experiment, but education is important enough that we should\u00a0prevent major failures, even for a small group. The norm will shift slowly as educators themselves learn. I think it's that learning aspect that makes the difference. I hear the saddest stories while working with children. Usually it's\u00a0educators lacking insight in themselves and their practise, as well as a very static approach to their profession. They are factory workers: follow the protocol, complete the checklist, get good numbers.\nHowever, more and more\u00a0teachers accept change in the form of technological innovation because of this cult-like movement of STEM (Science Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) education that is now taking over. I shouldn't complain, I am\u00a0surfing that wave, but STEM has become\u00a0a goal in itself. The A of Art is also too often left out of STEAM. The general idea of technological disruption is already rooted in many people's heads, so it's a small jump for people in the educational system to apply it to their field. Lots of schools in Belgium\u00a0are implementing\u00a0smart boards, apps, school fablabs etc.\u00a0without much thought. Just new shiny tools, which in the end are not optimally used because there is no change in mindset. The teachers, the schools etc.\u00a0rely on technology to avoid changing their behavior. Ironic, because reality is the opposite.\nWe do new biology education and that is\u00a0our trojan horse:\u00a0we can hide a new method in the new technological content that we bring. This also means that these changes to the methods\u00a0won't be too radical.

After this compulsory community, most strong extros mingle with other strong extros - and intros almost vanish from their life as it is awkward to have one between 8 other extros. Imagine the unpopular kid did not vanish, but once in a while checked your social network accounts in the last couple of years, and just shook his/her head at what you were doing. How misguided. How superficial. Most of the intros time however went into building self esteem over (failed attempts at) solving some ridiculously complicated, almost impossible problem.\n\nHow do you find this person? It is hard. You can look through your network all you want - it is full of other extros. And they are isolated. Especially, the powerful and strong intros. What are you to do? Ring random doorbells? Not quite, but searching for activities that would attract introverts may help (certain music or movies are a strong cue if they apply to your culture). In short: Go where other people (especially you and your friends) don't like to go, and see who is there. Listen and watch for weak signals. Another method would be to bring a couple of your extrovert friends to a relatively random crowd, and then be very extrovert in everyone's face. The ones that are running away are the ones you're looking for.\n\nThis can be easier and usually much faster to do on/with the internet. Actually, if you end up in a place that you don't understand, and people behave strangely - chances are you stumbled upon a community of mild intros. The strong introvert is like a Yeti. It leaves big footsteps but is rarely seen in person. \n\nSometimes a mild intro may be the gatekeeper of one or more strong intros. Thus getting to the real powerful connections is always a two step process. First you have to win trust and show you can engage an intro on their terms. Then you get into their sanctum. Having intro-respected people who will vow for your integrity makes things easier as you progress. But remember, you are in a different ecosystem that has different requirements and different dynamics. Okay, this was long - because you have to get it right or there is no point.\n\n\nIf you have an issue and found your introvert, you will have to find out this introverts needs. For that you'll have to understand in quite some detail what he/she is trying to achieve. Then discuss or observe how the work is conducted. If you can think of ways to improve the workflow you could carefully put them on the table, mostly to watch why and how they will be declined. Assume an intro will be too shy to tell you about the real motivation, so watch for weak signals on that. Networking / collaboration opportunities to be may be be ignored (often because they don't mix with the work mode). Carefully feel around why each opportunity is not taken, and let the explanations stand for now. We'll come to the emotional commitment in point 4.\nThe \"without breaking it\" part is crucial. I have done and attended quite a bit of interviews with conventional main stream media on scientific topics. Almost without fail, they disfigure the message - not seldom making exactly the mistake you explicitly implored them not to do. Less mainstream media (introvert niches) usually fares better. In the age of exact copy&paste or digital recording options this can be improved a lot. Just make sure whatever happens, the original detailed data can be quickly found, and you find a combination of cat pictures (transmission) and differential equations (reception) you can both live with.\nIf you got this far you already have a decent chance at this part. Unfortunately introverts are pretty diverse on some fronts (and blindingly simple on some others) so tread carefully initially. Chances are, if you come across as informed and sincere, and the other intro you have in tow is compatible, the emotional commitment part is not going to be difficult for you. It'll be more difficult for you to believe someone will have a emotional reaction to such a complicated concept.\n\n\nGetting yourself to understand the detail necessary to make an informed choice on whom to approach is probably the hard part. Introverts survive deep in specialist niches. Leaving this exact niche because some \"shallow new guy\" blathers something about it being a good idea is a recipe for disaster. Make a solid case why this is a risk worth taking, and remember the risk is mostly on the specialist. Even though these niches are hard to find it is often smarter to try again somewhere else than to force things. If you did your job well up to here you can often get some very valuable guidance into more appropriate parts of the community. Resist the urge to ask for endorsement if it is not signaled.\n\nI'll just repeat: 1 in 10!\n\nHow many cases did you do already? Less than 5? That would in all likelihood make it a bad idea. Remember intros are generally careful, risk averse people operating in a complicated environment. It is easy to break stuff that won't be fixable for you.\n\n*People use networks differently - thus networks should look differently to different people. There is no one size fits all. MBTI is probably a good middle ground starting point.\n\n**The introverts can ask me for an \"introvert way to world domination\" - which I know they won't.", "created_at": "2017-11-28 14:15:57.338533", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:26:33.467073", "tag_id": 815, "post_id": 12141, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 4536}, {"id": 8969, "text": null, "quote": "Pieter: \u201cWe evaluated it with the city administration and wanted to carry on.

According to statistics, 92% of Malagasy lived below the poverty threshold but no one rose up. When social pressure is too much, the point of rupture is not far, and the accumulation of frustration and deprivation often results in bloody explosions. However, this can be avoided. Just put yourself to nonviolent civil resistance! Nowadays, the Malagasy people are tired of going down to the streets to claim their rights as citizens. Why make the strike if it is to have each time the same scenario: Teaser bombs, lost bullets and blood flowing, as was the case in 1972, 2002, or in 2009? Why manifesting because it is the politicians who benefit in the end? Today, people prefer to stay at home and rant about the social network instead of expressing their frustration in public and questioning their leaders. And yet, it is not the subjects of contestation which are wanting. Traffics of all kinds, corruption, bad governance, lack of accountability of elected officials, non-respect of laws, hamper development of the country. It is now essential that the Malagasy rediscover that power belongs to them and that they learn how to fight against injustice, without dilatory maneuvering of the politicians, and without violence. As Martin Luther King Jr pointed out, active nonviolence is not a method for cowards. On the contrary, it is a real resistance. It is the art of using non-violent power to achieve sociopolitical objectives, especially through symbolic protests. This practice was popularized from 1921 by exemplary personalities like Gandhi in India, by Nelson Mandela and Steve Biko in South Africa, or Martin Luther King Jr in his fight against segregation. The Malagasy also experimented with nonviolent civil resistance, for example through publications in satirical journals under colonization, but the practice gradually lost face to the rise of the military and police repression, but Also facing the weariness of the main concerned - the citizens. Contemporary movements such as Wake-up Madagascar are now trying to awaken citizens' consciences and to revive non-violent civil resistance. Short-lived symbolic actions that do not create crowds and are therefore not illegal are regularly organized to denounce the fact of society that make jasper. Expose empty plates to say that the Malagasy are hungry, to walk in the streets of Antananarivo to demand the ratification of a charter on democracy or to make the dead on the place of independence in the city center of the capital to denounce the words which undermine the country are for example, part of the non-violent civil resistance. It is precisely to spread this philosophy on the desire for change through non-violent actions that many projects such as LIANA or Learning Initiative Aiming at Non Violent Action which was initiated by Wake Up Madagascar, Liberty 32 and the WYLD program Women and Youth's League for Democracy with the support of the International Center for Non-Violent Conflict. Since the 70's during the 1st Republic in Madagascar, Malagasy people have been manipulate and influenced by politicians who wants a place on government by force.
