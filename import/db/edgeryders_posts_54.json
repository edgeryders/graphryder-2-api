There are three ways that I can think it can be done:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Low-level, batch: run a SQL query on the database that will assign the \"triage\" tag the same name and ID as\u00a0\"resource allocation\". This cannot be done from the Drupal admin interface, it requires Matt to write the query and launch it from the server.</li>\n\n<li>Low-level, slow: go through the annotations tagged\u00a0\"triage\" (I switched back to the old name for clarity) and change them manually to \"resource allocations\". This is not so bad, because there are only four annotations tagged \"triage\", and they are numbers 1755, 1815, 1817 (these last two are on the same comment, number 4225), and 1822. This would be my recommended method.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Workaround: create a new tag called \"resource allocation\". Assign it as a parent tag to both the old \"resource allocation\" and \"triage\". This does not really solve the problem, but it does associate \"triage\" and \"resource allocation\".\u00a0</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nFor comprehensive tag management, however, this is not going to fly. We will need to implement a better way to do it.

Currently she is lecturing in the Georgian Institute of Public Affairs a course related to Web Journalism and new media. She is very enthusiastic to be part of the network. I will send you both a message so that you can contact each other.\"</em>\n\nAs you can see by the name, Nino Japiashvili is native Georgian. Lela already introduced us to each other, and I have invited Nino to join the <a href=\"/spot-the-future\">public Spot the Future group</a> so we can consider her and Inge Snip as possible engagement managers for Georgia. Hope it's still on time ... sorry it took so long, yet I also think that the timeline of the project is <em>quite</em> tight ...\n\n", "created_at": "2014-03-12 14:21:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:14.306918", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 214, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 15856, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 5123, "post_number": 5, "raw": "@Noemi yeah I guess we need to count on walk-ins-, because I won't have time to promote the event in Brussels, as I only arrive tomorrow.

They are: Arthur, Matthias, Noemi, Nadia, Asta, Vinay and myself. All members are also directors. Five, as you know, are executives (involved in day-to-day operations); two, Asta and Vinay, non-executives.\n\nAfter the tax return is filed (April 30th), membership will change in two ways. First, two non-execs will be appointed to replace Asta and Vinay. Second, one exec will be appointed to replace Arthur \u2013 assuming we can find one. But we don't yet know who the new directors will be.\n\nThe only people who have the formal right to vote on the new members are, indeed, the current members of the company. But Arthur proposed, and we all agreed, that the executive directors use their votes to appoint the new non-executive directors chosen by the community, hopefully by consensual decision. Also, we have taken a vow of silence, in the sense that we don't allow ourselves to say \"I like X\" or \"I think\u00a0 Y would do a really good job\".\n\nThe executive director(s) we will choose ourselves. The basis is, and has been since we started the company, that of most companies: execs sink a lot of their time and energy into this project, which is very uncertain and so far has not been able to compensate our time. We need to personally like each other and have a high esteem of each other's abilities and ethics, or this is a non-starter. However, we would very much like to have people come to us and ask to be a part of ER LBG. So far only one person has: David Bovill.

(Drives me mad that the public purse is spending billions on obesity, whilst big food corporates are profiting from cheap, sugary, snack sales...)\n\nThe preventative works with mental health and capacity too - keeping active and interacting with others helps no end.\n\nThere's been a lot of mention of finding new ways of addressing the issues with caring for the elderly in recent weeks, especially with the problems of capacity in A&amp;E and more general hospital wards due to the lack of the necessary social care. Heard of a scheme in Wakefield the other day, where triage is used between various branches of care (hospital, local GP / nurses, local or community facilities such as care homes) which was proving very effective at managing need and ensuring \"efficient\" (for want of a better word) addressing of peoples' needs. (Some volunteer services, such as Help the Aged and the like were involved to help with transport and checking on a patient when they were ready to go home, rather than them waiting for ambulance services and staff from\u00a0social care services to check on their immediate needs once back - but this did seem better than the individual concerned waiting unnecessarily in hospital, at huge cost.)\n\nAnother benefit found was that building such local links ensured the elderly were \"monitored\" as in an eye was kept on their health and quality of life, and people could be referred to locally available facilities that they may not have been aware of or may have been reluctant to request or attend.\n\nDefinitely think the time is ripe for new approaches, and also that a new willingness to try these is developing on the part of CCGs, healthcare trusts and local councils. Hopefully this will extend to national government, and they will allow local solutions to develop from the ground up. They are doing so in other health sectors, so there is hope. The CQC - given its very specific mandate and structure - may be another issue!

I have done some work on the creative economy when I was working for the Italian Ministry of economic development, and the mantra then was: the creative sector is very welcome to figure out whether it has an edge to produce public goods. When it does, it can come forward as an actor of regional development - which means also applying for funding allocated to regional development.\n\nThere is at least one case in which culture does have an edge: city/region marketing. The edge in question is that culture is much faster than, say, infrastructure to achieve impact. From the day a decision is made to build a new metro line to the day it comes into operation, you are probably looking at 5/10 years in which you are investing but reaping no results; if you try to change the perception of a city with an art festival, you can be up and running in nine months.\n\nIn her reports, Alessia has highlighted the road from commons to culture: assets such as theaters, when subject to a common resource-ish access regime, can be the basis for sustainable cultural businesses.

The poorer area, which had a lot of investment in community development, had a very tight central network [this is the diagram in the picture], which surrounded the people involved in the existing community development work. The richer area, where there had been no recent investment in community development, had a more random-looking network, like a packet of dropped spaghetti, with multiple one-to-one links and some overlaps but no central core network.

We <em>started</em>\u00a0with the idea that the most innovative (and radicalized) European youth are separated by institutions by an impassable chasm, and that cooperation is impossible. This view is held not only by many innovators, but also by most people within institutions. \u00a0What we got at the end was the idea that the chasm is indeed there, <em>but it is not impassable</em>. The reason for this is twofold:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>out of the range of proposals that come from the civil society to some government agency (say, a unit of the European Commission), some will be perceived by said agency as impossible or unrealistic (\"you'll have to push a law through parliament for that\"), but others will not. Access Space is a perfect example: this type of project they can and will support (AS is in fact funded by the European Regional Development Fund, so it's not just talk, but actual money on the table). I disagree with you on the point that it gets support because it is cheap; but even if you were right, in the end it would not really matter. What matter is that James and people like him get support for their actions.</li>\n\n<li>people in the institutions are, well, people, just like you orme (and in fact I am a man of the institutions); given a reasonably open and welcoming iinteraction environment, you can have a conversation with us. Some of us are reasonably smart. All can learn. Once the ice is broken, the incentives are there to collaborate more closely: civil society gets better directed resources for its projects, institutions get better value for taxpayer euro.</li>\n\n</ol>Proof of concept: the day after this session, and largely because of it, the Council of Europe and the European Commission were discussing the deployment of Edgeryders towards another project they have.\u00a0\n\nIn my opinion the reports of all-out conflict you report are like those of <a href=\"http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/368850.html\">Mark Twain's death</a>: greatly exaggerated. The session was a clear win. Not despite the disagreement, but because of it - and because it was managed, so that it stayed respectful and conducive to a better, deeper conversation.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-07-16 10:17:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:58.620541", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 409, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24787, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 431, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Gladly, but why not community calls?</b>\n\nHi,\n\nWell, that's the thing with written communication, it's just more thoughtful of people's different times and anyone can engage in their own terms.

In practice, this means that more \"meeting points\" are needed, not only those formal ones, but maybe more fruitful disscussion about REAL entry points and mechanisms for innovative European youth to become integrated into the policy cycle..

This book very clearly describes how danger of endless economic growth, the ways in which it is no longer making greater prosperity or happiness (in the UK atleast), and ways in which we could organize to create social well-being while ending the treadmill of quantitative economic growth and ecological degradation. Yet the SDC was quickly disbanded by the new conservative government who seem to be ideologically opposed to thinking about environmental sustainability unless it becomes a buzz word that legitimises the creation of new markets. I am not writing this because I think the SDC were the answer to our problems (<u><strong>FAR</strong></u> from it!) - but just to point out that there is some somewhat enlightened people in government fighting against destructive economic growth at the expense of the environment and future generations.\n\nThanks for the link about Kevin's work. I am somewhat familiar with some of this line of thinking. To me it seems to underestimate the manner in which markets tend towards monopolies without some kind of regulatory system. I am sympathetic but I have yet to see what I consider to be a viable proposal for how stateless market anarchism proposes to resolve environmental problems or deal with the 'free-loader' problem. I am attracted to many elements of anarchist political theory but I have real problems with the utopianism of both right-winged and left-winged anarchism. Still I think this terrritory is fertile and could be the space in which better political models and organising strategies emerge.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-13 23:59:49", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:47.860919", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 430, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18130, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 4546, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>so,</b>\n\nwhat I was thinking is that perhaps in every country and for every contributor, there are other things that work.\u00a0\n\nIn Georgia we already have the informal gatherings, so that wouldnt work as a reward necessarily?

The Making Lote group was conceived as a workspace. It is messy as all workspaces are, and for the same reason: that people are authorized \u2013 and indeed encouraged \u2013 to edit them, add content, modify etc. We knew beforehands we would need a read-only space for communication purposes (just as we had one for LOTE1 and another for LOTE2); but, at the time of setting up the workspace, we did not have the content, and we opted to start growing the host of LOTE3 participants organically from the volunteers. I was one of the people who pushed for this solution. So far it appears to be working.\n\nWe will always have the need for read-only. Because:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>some people we interact with will never be community members: potential clients and other stakeholders, for example. They are just going to take 5 mins, tops, to find out about us as they ponder whether we are worth getting in touch with. The interaction will then continue (or not) via email, or maybe in person.</li>\n\n<li>others might become community members, but they need information to make that decision. During ER1 this was not so much of an issue, because we had the Council of Europe study creating content all the time: we would push that content out, and people would find themselves on the main site without perceiving (or indeed needing to perceive) its overall architecture. If they were stimulated enough, they would leave a comment and start this way to engage with us. From there, it would be relatively simple, as we had just one overarching purpose for the site. Now, it's not so simple anymore.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nYou may object that my point 2 only says that we should sit down and fix the main site's overall structure. I would very much like that, but I admit I have no idea how to do it. It seems to me that there is a fundamental conflict between readability (that calls for editorialized content/organization information and read-only) and actionability (that calls for messy UG content, customized organization information and read-and-write). This architecture problem might be too difficult for me to solve elegantly. So, either someone else cracks it or it's down to unelegant hacks like minisites.\n\nOk, this discussion is quite well developed. I see that we are already at my second-most preferred solution.

One is less important, the other is more important.\u00a0\n\nThe less important one concerns only my own sense of fairness. Since I am The Site Admin, I cannot rely on The Site Admin to protect me from trolling and abuse. If anyone had accused you (or any ordinary user) of fraud, I would have invoked admin powers and banned the person into a smoking hole. But of course, if I do that to protect myself, it looks lame. So: I don't go ballistic, but I do speak my heart. I am careful to (1) only refer to episodes and not people (so, not \"X is a liar\" but \"Y has resorted to misrepresentation here\") (2) describe what happened, and only what happened, and people can check for themselves (insult, check, misrepresentation, check) and (3) yes, I allow myself some personal feelings. These are my own, you can not share them but not really tell me how I should feel.\n\nThe more important one concerns the general tone of the Edgeryders online space. People should not be allowed to go berserk in it. I can't ban, because of the above; so I administer some verbal punishment. But if I fail to react, I am sending the message that it is OK to abuse people. And, I am afraid, so do you (again, not you as Sam, but you as some user): because a casual bystander will not know who is Sam, and who is Alberto, who is admin and who is not, and will just wonder \"what, the community manager is taking holidays or what?\".

We can all agree on the protocol as a goal, what happens with it afterwards is up to the user. In this stage, it is desirable that the way we get there does not jeopardize\u00a0the use some of the team members have in mind (or at least minimally).\n\nCheap insulin is one of the\u00a0reasons, but a precedent for more of this kind of research is also a reason, as this could decrease the cost of many more medicines. We can only guess, but I doubt the lesson Novartis would draw is \"we need to do more open research\"\u00a0after they pick\u00a0up half-finished open knowledge and successfully turn it into a product or profit. From releasing a somewhat finished protocol into the world, they might still not take that message away, but more citizen researchers might be inclined to, and keep the effort going.\u00a0It becomes an optimization problem to balance\u00a0short term and long term economic benefits, taking the strategy to get there into account.\n\nThe comparison of the dynamics in\u00a0software is fair, but that is not to say that there is not a more favorable outcome. The stakes are also higher when considering medicine. The difference between having or not having a piece of software is not death.\n\nOn 3: agreed to an extent. There is a lot of wickedness in the biotech industry. Research is very slow and expensive, almost as extreme as it gets. The dynamics do change at these extremes, I think, and that asks for a different strategy. To break through, accumulating small wins in an iterative way might not be ideal.\u00a0Reaching a particular benchmark that actually matters big time (eg. the first open source production protocol for insulin) perhaps would be.\n\nVolunteer time can drastically undercut the cost, and make this type of research more efficient than what a Novartis could hope for. We already seeing signs of that in the DIYbio movement. But\u00a0we are still learning how to leverage the\u00a0advantage. Hardware, software and wetware are definitely enabling us at this point, but are also still developing. Hopefully these things are bringing us to a tipping point, quicklier than the large companies are.\n\nI think this is still a learning phase, where there are vulnerabilities\u00a0on several fronts.

Although different mediums, I would agree that as individuals we export our networking styles from the real world onto our virtual networks. I therefore think that our virtual networking tendencies are not a disjuncture from how we would socialise in the physical world but an extension of it. As is to be expected of course, just as everything else virtual social networking brings with it new opportunities and constraints.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI also identify with your instincts of wanting to segregate your different social networks. I have done so in my real and virtual life and I think so have most people I've known to a lesser or greater extent. I feel that it is only natural, especially for young people still trying to carve out a niche. Often by doing so however, as you rightly mention, one risks underestimating the capacity of people to accommodate and accept each other. Not only this, often we learn from people we least expect to. I think I have come to appreciate this over the years. So while five years ago I would have strictly bifurcated my different social networks, I have increasingly come to mix them in the right doses over the years. I say 'in right doses' because I feel that as individuals\u00a0 from specific backgrounds embedded in different social\u00a0 networks we often set boundaries and judge the extent to which mixing your social network is socially acceptable. For instance, as someone from a Somali background I know not to take male friends to the area of London where my family lives. Similarly, I have never introduced people I knew from doing part-time jobs when I was at school to my university friends. I guess we do this because we feel that since people come from different cultural, religious or class backgrounds, they might not understand each other or have a common ground on which to start a conversation. Recently however, I feel that I have stopped worrying too much about what people in my different social networks would think about each other and by extension about me if they were exposed to each other. I now share cheesy Bollywood songs with my Indian friends, make Somali jokes with friends and family, share intellectual articles with colleagues from university all on the same social forum. The wonderful thing about this I feel is that it allows people in your different social networks (including close friends and family) to get to know and understand you better. This in turn allows you to act as a via medium between cultures and worldviews. However, I am still conscious of the boundaries.\u00a0 I guess it is the little steps that will make the big difference in the end.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-20 18:03:38", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:36.938317", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 488, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 547, "user_id": 1487, "topic_id": 514, "post_number": 1, "raw": "The purpose of this group is to create a roadmap of potential development for the EdgeRyders online space.\n\nThe designs will be created parallel to actual development.

Wir erarbeiten oft Ideen und Konzepte im Framework,um wirtschaftlich funktionieren zu k\u00f6nnen.\u00a0Z.B. finde ich das Unmnastery Projekt interessant. Ein Austausch sollte stattfinden, so dass jeder davon profitieren kann. Best for both.\n\nIch w\u00fcnsche mir mehr praktisch zu arbeiten, damit ich etwas Neues kennen lerne, vielleicht w\u00e4re es einfacher bereits\n\neine Idee vorgegeben zu bekommen und diese umzusetzen. Die Kommunikation zwischen GWK und Designer sollte st\u00e4tig stattfinden,um das Projekt zu optimieren.\n\nMan kann Marketing nicht nach Regeln durchf\u00fchren, es gibt kein Rezept, mann muss versuchen neue Wege zu finden und kreativ zu werden.\u00a0Learning by doing wist immer wieder ein interessanter Ansatz.\n\nD: \u00dcberschneidet sich die Motivation des Auftraggebers auch mal mit derjenigen des GWKlers?\n\nJ: Das unterscheidet sich von Fall zu Fall. Es gibt zwei F\u00e4lle: Man arbeitet zusammen und hat die gleiche Motivation am Projekt, nur da\u00df einer\u00a0eher die Idee und die Vision hat, w\u00e4hrend der andere sich um das Praktische k\u00fcmmert; um die Kommunikation.

About every month they organise a cooking event called \u201c50 shades of\u2026\u201d. This time it was spinach. They put up different cooking stations where we were welcome to help the cooks. The informal and open-minded atmosphere made conversations of all sorts very easy. <a href=\"http://hackingutopia.cre8tives.org/50-shades-of-spinach/\">Here</a> are some pictures of the event.\n\nFor us the most important insight we gained is the following:\n\nThe Afghan women who cooked told us that they live in a refugee camp where they do not have any cooking facility and are therefore more than happy about every chance to cook elsewhere. It relaxes and enables them to act out. Every second week they meet up at the KitchenHub to cook. To feel secured it is important to them to be only a small and female group on those days. Therefore the size of the group is kept small even though there has been an increasing demand. Such places are rare and seem to be deeply needed. We are going to cook with one of them in a park to try out whether outside cooking especially in terms of privacy is an option for them as well or not.\n\nWe heard another related story at our experimental cooking night. Three friends from Syria joined us that day. Two of them are living in an emergency accommodation. The other one got transferred to another camp. The two former do not have access to any kitchen where they live, the latter can use the shared kitchen. From time to time his two friends even join him for cooking, because they really miss doing it.\n\nNot having access to cooking facilities seems to be a big issue. \u201cFood security\u201d including cooking is part of \u201cfeeling at home\u201d. How can we enable people to do so?\n\n", "created_at": "2016-06-02 13:56:24", "updated_at": "2018-05-26 04:13:13.655488", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 444, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 20.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 728, "user_id": 3390, "topic_id": 695, "post_number": 1, "raw": "I grew up in Palo Alto and graduated from Gunn High School in 2008.

Again, this is not integrated with edgeryders.eu, but it does rely on APIs for both content (like Edgesense) and also OpenEthno annotations. This is something we'd like to keep ideally. It will be further developed in the course of OpenCare and (if we get it) RECODE. You do have a plan for all of this (Annotator.js), but I am not familiar enough with Open Ethnographer: is it like Edgesense, independent\u00a0from edgeryders.eu installation?

I've heard this idea that \"change should start from individual education and enlightenment\" on may occasions here in Nepal, but this article expresses it very clearly. So maybe it's the right place to start a discussion about it :)\n\nSure, I very much agree that education and values are crucial for progress in a country. But are they sufficient? I got to know so many young people who <em>already</em> \"understand the society and \u2026 work towards its progress, persistently\", as you put it. Their generosity and goodwill was very visible in the post-earthquake volunteer movement. But this movement mostly disintegrated by now \u2013 it seems volunteers just can't sustain their efforts for the coming three or five years of recovery work. So beyond discipline and values, it seems Nepal needs a well-working mode of organizing progress on a national level.\n\nI understand that formal procurement processes for public infrastructure work badly in Nepal \u2013 <em>this</em> will not be the mode to organize for progress. (I've heard hilarious stories about a much-needed water pipeline to Kathmandu being built since about \u2026 what was it, 30 years?) I also understand the frustration of Nepali people about \"trying to change the entire society, unsuccessfully\". So that also does not work (not even armed conflict was able to change some things \u2026).\n\nBut how about a third way: community-organized projects beyond the family level but way below the national level?

By reaching out to the existing Edgeryders community and its extended networks and asking who knows of interesting initiatives and asking them to reach out to them and interview them using a few simple questions.\n\nEither they can interview the people, or maybe ask them to join one of the regular stewardship hangouts we should be hosting on a weekly basis and being open to be asked questions like Nick was today.\n\nSo building the wiki starts with:\n\n1) formulating a call for contributions and the questions to ask. <a href=\"/u/saidhamideh\">Said Hamideh</a>\u00a0has a great idea for where they can go/ how to make very good use of this material in addition to getting work done the individual projects.\n\n2) getting the word out about the calls\n\n3) putting up Makerfox request for the case studies and matching with offer?\n\nFor more information/ notes from our discussions that lead to this have a look at this<a href=\"/t/community-call-minutes-and-actionables-3rd-july/3233\"> Community Call summary</a>.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-07-03 14:32:59", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:18.009888", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 441, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3519, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 3486, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e6922c0bfc18b9648352c03b076f2941225afa90.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"484\"><br>\n\nI dont want to think about the sheer volume of waste-it notes that go in the bin every workshop or brainstorming session. Not to mention the fact that capturing their contents and posting online e.g. in a wiki is a real pain. Which means that more often than not we don't. This lack of accessible documentation in turn means distributed collaboration around developing promising ideas does not happen as often as it could.\n\nThe unMonastery could only be realised because a small number of us were very disciplined about documentation. If it were less difficult and time consuming to bridge offline conversations and online interactions, I am convinced we could see many more interesting and ambitious projects realised.\n\nWe could try to get participants to learn to document online already but there is something about manually sketching which facilitates thinking processes in a way that typing doesn't seem to. At least for me.\n\nSo what could a possible solution look like? A combination of a reusable notebook, mobile app *OCR scanner*, and the Edgeryders open source platform (drupal social commons). See sketch above. And if we add reusable whiteboard sheets or something like this <a href=\"http://www.whitelinesshop.se/link-your-whiteboard-large-sized-tags/358-0\">whitelines solution</a> for reading any white surface (but with OCR scanning so notes are actually machine readable, not just images).\n\nWhat do you guys think, is this something we could design and do some work on ahead of the event and then prototyped and refined into a working solution during the hackathon?\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-08-12 15:42:38", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:19.235419", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 302, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2144], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3787, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 3754, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Running a project that benefits us all for free, but monetary donations are never enough to even cover your expenses?

It debuts in this session, and you may join its first-ever live use with your own projects and donations.\n\nWe worked on this innovation over the last two months, and it's nearly done now. It will debut in this LOTE4 session with a presentation and interactive live demo about how you can donate to projects and causes without money.\n\nWhat this new tool solves is the dilemma of donating: On one hand, you want to donate to your favorite Commons project (open source, open hardware, a community center, whatever). On the other hand, you can't afford to donate in money as much as you want to, and your favorite project often has no use for the items and services that you could donate in-kind.\n\nNow with Makerfox Support, your favorite project <em>A</em> can get desired products and services from user <em>B</em>, who wants to support project <em>C</em>, which gets desired products and services from you, who wants to support project <em>A</em>. Got it? :D It's just the simplest form of an in-kind donation exchange to solve the coincidence of wants problem. This, and more complex variants, are found by the Makerfox algorithm.\n\nWe will do the first-ever live demo of this new\u00a0\"<a href=\"https://www.makerfox.com/\">Makerfox</a> Support\" feature in this session. You can just watch, but we invite you to be a part of it: in that case, register a <a href=\"https://www.makerfox.com/\">Makerfox</a> account and bring a notebook, your project and / or skills and items to donate to others' projects.

However, I will try to find a constructive way of sharing the story. Ideal scenario for me is that we can all learn from it and possiby restructure Edgeryders LBG, so this stuff doesnt happen again. </span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>Open community needs an open corporate shell, if any. </span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>The story is rather banal: it involves money, unresolved conflicts, mutual blame, blackmailing and threats on behalf of some of the members of Edgeryders LBG board, loss of trust and burn outs - it is just very very ugly. </span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>Which makes it difficult to talk about on the platform, because we don\u2019t like ugly things. At the same time, I feel like it would be wrong to pretend this never happened, because it will mean no one will learn from it and it there will be more chance for it to happen again.</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>Edgeryders LBG blocking the funding without knowing anything about the project plan nor the budget? </span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>Make a long story short using current iteration of Edgeryders LBG as a corporate shell as proposed here is not working. However, it might be brilliant model for home grown projects, it is dangerous for external teams and has almost destroyed my project. </span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>Ironically, LOTE4 is about stewardship, so it is about the time to see whether Edgeryders legal structure is currently capable of practicing what it preaches. I would like to tell the whole story. I know this story has two sides, and I\u2019m very likely to meet confrontation. That\u2019s why I will be only sharing facts. </span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>For everyone who will read it, please remember, my aim here is not confrontation. I just can\u2019t stand hypocrisy, and believe that if ugly stuff get\u2019s swept under the rug it becomes very dangerous. </span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>I have to say that people involved in Edgeryders LBG have been doing a tremendous work of community engagement, outreach and organisation of LOTE events, and my respect towards this work is a main reason why I\u2019m bothered to open this discussion.</span></span>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/39ad798340888b8df53fde00cdef1568199e5607.jpg\" width=\"688\" height=\"482\"><br>\n\n", "created_at": "2014-10-26 16:30:02", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:21.056944", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 917, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 15990, "user_id": 2278, "topic_id": 3715, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>we like you like it :)</b>\n\nHi, thanks for the logos as well, so now we are working on making titles and credits following your order, we also need to know what kind of font we have to use and the color for the graphic background! \u00a0We are also working on sound and color correction, we made better cuts and changed some cover images, by this evening we should be able to upload a second draft version, we are also looking for a different music, we checked the site you suggested and found a nice track but we are still waiting for allowance to use it and we are not really sure we could actually use it. there are also other sites with free of licence music but there's tons of music of different kinds so a suggestion on the preferred genre would be appreciated! :)\u00a0\n\nHave a nice day\n\n", "created_at": "2014-10-01 08:34:48", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:29.737054", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 157, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4125, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 4092, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hi <a href=\"/u/bembo_davies\">@Bembo_Davies</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"/u/katalin\">@katalin</a>\u00a0&amp; co., congrats for the printed prototype I saw at Transmediale, much easier to browse.

We identify the rooms available, divide the day into 1-hour slots and proceed to allocate the different proposals to the different slots.

Previous residencies welcomed makers, artists and designers coming from different backgrounds and ready to collaborate with us and share knowledge with our community.\n\n<strong>opencare Maker in Residence</strong>\n\nFrom April to July 2017 we are opening our lab for a special edition of MIR.\n\nSince 2016 we are working on opencare, an european project which received funding from EU. opencare is a project and a global community working together to make health and social care accessible for all, open source, privacy-friendly and participatory. It starts from the assumption that state and private institutions will be unable to meet the demands for care in the 21st century and that new, more open, participatory, community-based methods are required.\n\nWeMake, which is part of opencare consortium, organizes the first opencare Maker in Residence and invites people and collectives which are working on a grassroot solution for care based on digital tools, to submit their projects and collaborate with us.\n\nThe opencare Maker in Residence will take place from April to July 2017 and is structured around workshops, making, discussions with experts, including engineers, programmers, designers, policymakers, and community members.\n\nResidents will live and work together on-site providing an opportunity for intense collaboration, creativity, and learning to improve their project.\n\nWe are getting ready to open the call with all the details!

While the work has been supported growth and socializing new members, it's not part of a long term strategy with measurable objectives. There are no hours in the day and resources to cover the full range of that\u00a0work.\u00a0Hopefully we can start doing more strategizing and streamlining community activities across the different projects, with the help of our in-house wizard, John :-)\u00a0\n\nSome early thoughts from me - ideally we use the time on Thursday to go over what is:\u00a0\n\n<strong>1) needed for ER community development and growth. </strong>Here\u00a0the largest focus is integration with\u00a0<a href=\"/en/the-reef\">The Reef</a>, Edgeryders long term endeavor. For our purposes this has the advantage that it involves the whole community, not just a subset or focus on newcomers - as with timebound, more specifically focused projects. A key point here is re-activation of members who may have lost touch with recent opportunities.\n\nI can prepare my list, but good to have yours too, even if on more general community needs and not connected to the Reef.\n\n<strong>2) already covered partially </strong>(existing tools we are using and time needing to be allocated on a routine basis; things we found to be working) - more regular tasks, less big strategic goal; it's where I see myself and the two of us and\u00a0other active edgeryders working together i.e. Natalia is also covering part of this from time to time.\n\n<strong>3) not covered at all. </strong>This is where John's\u00a0skillset\u00a0comes in handy and where I have to say, we require more of a strategic goal and novel approaches. We stand to learn from you, and I look forward to following your lead.\n\nLooking forward to <strong>Thursday at 6:30 PM CET on skype (add me: noemi.salantiu)</strong> and to your thoughts - feel free to post them early on in the comments here.\n\nDate: 2017-04-06 19:30:00 - 2017-04-06 19:30:00, Europe/Brussels Time.", "created_at": "2017-04-04 16:55:13", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:35.918875", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 434, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 10.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [145], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6256, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 6223, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5602271e41da4f44c87c6cd42d3dd6b320a22cf2.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"345\">\n\n<strong>Join the \\#openvillage drop in video chat ! </strong>Today and every Wednesday at 18:00 CET <a href=\"https://hangouts.google.com/call/in6dfwadzfdsldfynvnsatf75me\">here</a>\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\">About</h2>\n\n<a href=\"/t/openvillage-festival/535\">OpenVillage</a> is a participant-run festival.

That's one of the skins around the coffee cherry's kernel (\"coffee bean\"), <a href=\"http://legacy.sweetmarias.com/RIP_Coffee_Roasting_In_Parchment/\">see here for high-res images</a>.\n\nBecause due to hilarious a misunderstanding with the coffee farmers from Hansapur and our team in Nepal, the coffee arrived as green beans <em>in the parchment shell</em>. (White skin is what, the silverskin? So blue skin is the parchment shell? Turns out, the other way around. Cross-agricultural communication is difficult!)\n\nWe made an initial attempt at this problem (and some mess) during a coffee hacking day at The Reef Brussels, Edgeryders' co-working / co-living space. While that worked, a hairdryer was not the most efficient tool for the problem \u2026\n\nWhich brings us to this video (and much more mess) of yesterday's version of the process. Enjoy watching :-)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pserEjyo9DA\n\nIf anyone's wondering, this is not the final version of the process, but a prototype used exclusively for personal / private purposes, with my very own personal 3 kg coffee I bought from Hansapur farmers :) However, if any small-scale coffee farmer is looking for a small-scale coffee hulling process with self-built / low-cost tools, it could be a useful start. For that case, here's the first part of the process to remove the parchment shells, creating the green beans / shell mix we were winnowing above: a simple kitchen blender, at slow speed, if necessary with somewhat dulled metal blades.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a9737e64e343d7773f8a1b5c6d667c744a9f36e2.jpg\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\">", "created_at": "2017-06-29 11:21:45", "updated_at": "2019-05-09 00:52:39.303178", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 311, "wiki": false, "reads": 23, "score": 12336.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 3791], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7434, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 5240, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Urgent: Include this in next email to all participants?</b>\n\n<a href=\"/u/justyna_krol\">@Justyna_Krol</a>\u00a0hi and thanks for assigning yourself this task.

My outsider's impression was that of a relatively well-knit community, only to later hear the local organisers (themselves a spontaneous gathering of residents) say that they don't even know each other (that is, the very members of the organising group, not the \u00b1300 people that passed by the signing stand they set up). Some were known faces, but it was with this\u00a0occasion\u00a0that they got to talk and realise they all want the same thing - and that they have a chance of getting there together, only through a concerted effort. So maybe needing each other is what triggers it? In any case, what the conditions are for a community to emerge is no small question.

Also from the direct costs - travels are very clearly defined, but we can be flexible with how we allocate those and to whom, as long as they are attached to a task for purposes of\u00a0reporting.\n\nWhere the doubts are is with direct costs:\u00a0non staff. Nadia's question I think falls here:\n\n<strong>If we cannot give away cash prizes, can we pay small amounts of money for specific deliverables to \"competition\" participants? If yes, do these fall under direct or indirect costs?</strong>\n\nSome of these \"prizes\" (more like \"perks\")\u00a0can meet activities we budgeted for, and which require us to work with collaborators.\u00a0For example:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><span>Task: Seed and drive online conversations -</span> includes an amount for blogging, which is budgeted as non-staff cost. This\u00a0means we will have\u00a0help contracted for small amounts which will be paid upon deliverable. Because it's non-staff, we don't need time sheets, only valid contract.</li>\n\n<li>Task: Outreach and onboarding - includes an amount for workshop services (NB not facilitation, which is under staff costs and\u00a0needs timesheets as per our budgeting). Services can be catering, but can also be contracting someone to take care of logistics and paying them agains workshop deliverable. Because that\u00a0budget is for non-staff, we don't need time sheets, only a valid contract and proof of expenses - maybe even traveling, where that is the case.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nBasically looking at how our nonstaff budget was put in the proposal, this makes sense.

Catch up soon! :-)\n\n", "created_at": "2013-11-10 19:26:02", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:20.179139", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 154, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [24884], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23988, "user_id": 104, "topic_id": 5459, "post_number": 14, "raw": "<b>Comment on How it works?</b>\n\nSince the heading is how it works, I would start with spell out a bit of the background (who is involved and how the overall program is conceived before before spellng out the process.\u00a0 Here's my suggestion:\n\n\"WHAT?\n\nOp3ncare is an EU funded program made up of three things:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>A PLATFORM where people can share stories, ideas and insights and make new connections;</li>\n\n<li>A diverse and distributed COMMUNITY or network of individuals and groups, mainly in Europe but including the whole world, exploring alternative, more long-term sustainable solutions to healthcare;</li>\n\n<li>A PROCESS that brings people together from this community to share, inspire, connect and collaborate.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThe aim is to bring together people, virtually or physically, to gather and share stories, ideas and insights. Out of this will emerge new ideas, new solutions and new connections that benefit all.\n\nWHO?\n\nThere are two main roles:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>The <strong>Op3ncarers:</strong>people who care, and are willing to share their stories about how they care. People like you!</li>\n\n<li>The <strong>curators</strong>: these are people who have created and maintain the platform, and curate the content. Principally this is the hosts, Edgeryders (a consultancy that specialises in community-based solutions to complex societal challenges), Ezio Manzini (a leading design strategist for social innovation), and [insert others as you think relevant],</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nTHE PROCESS\n\nWe (the curators) have devised a four stage process, described below. We invite you to engage at all and any stage. \u00a0Every single contribution is valued, whether it is telling a story, leaving a thoughtful comment, bringing cake to a community gathering or helping to build a prototype.\"\n\nThen you have the table with the four stages. In the table, I would be careful about using \"We\" and instead be more specific. So rather than saying :\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, we've done this before :)\u00a0\u00a0 I would say \"Edgeryders are experienced in taking concepts and turning them into reality\" or something like that.\n\nUnder Impact, where it says TBC, I would put:\n\n\"It is too early to say exactly how the work will be taken forward. It will depend on the outcomes of the previous stages. What is fixed is a conference in September 2017 that will bring together all the various strands of work, and can also serve as a launchpad for new initiatives.\"\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-03-30 10:58:24", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:13.014516", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 433, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24505, "user_id": 102, "topic_id": 1463, "post_number": 15, "raw": "<b>A can do attitude</b>\n\nThank you so much for writing this :) I have always been faced with people who are very structured around education bringing them skills, and not through a natural affinity or skills learnt in life. Some people are just naturally geared to certain skills. If we all learnt the same things in the same way, we'd be of no real use to anyone else. I find that my skills are writing, Communications Skills and the ability to speak in front of others. I have never been afraid of people who are seen to be somehow bigger than me professionally or personally, and I have a strong passion for clear communication and getting the point across so everyone can have equal understanding of whatever is being communicated.\n\nI completely agree you should never look down on what you can do. I have found this out recently as there are things I can do specifically, but I always believed everyone else could do them to, but that is so not the case. Everyone has their place and what they can do, and even if those skills are similar to others, no one else will be able to present those skills in the same way you can :)\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-09 17:14:16", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:15.786486", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 214, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24857, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 786, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Admission is sometimes the hardest submission</b>\n\nI read that somewhere, and interesting how it holds true in this case.\n\nI said it elsewhere, is there a way to think about recruiting from the very community someone whom the city can trust to run co-design sessions? or experiment: some ran by people already on board, some ran by people brought in aka\u00a0citizen experts..\n\nThank you for staying in the loop @Matteo - it helps knowledge buildign a lot.

Gone for good. I don't doubt that Edgeryders can provide great quality consultancy, nor do I doubt Nadia's and your ability to sell the offer well. So if it's still that hard a sale, it must be a problem on the customer side. Do we want to permanently deal with a bunch of customers who are that hard to persuade of a valuable offer?? Because it will result in a highly undependable stream of contracts and thus, income.\n\nAs for the analogy to the subscription model: regarding the publisher's perspective it is indeed related. A business model is however also about who are the customers, not just the mode of selling. So producing advice for decision makers / government / NGOs and producing advice for our own folks (like the book project I proposed) are essentially different business models. And the latter one should be as open as possible to maximize the benefit, since those who can benefit are a diverse group: some can pay for the service, some can't. That's why I would shy aways from a subscription fee and closed-access content, since it deters many who could benefit, while open content does not deter anyone ... . Of course you're right that a book project is a one-off idea. But it can be serialized: if it works, the next book will be on hacking housing and urban space, and so on.\n\nBut I guess I should demonstrate what I mean. So, who else is up for running a crowdfunding campaign for a first open content product of Edgeryders?\n\n", "created_at": "2013-09-05 16:00:37", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:32.116239", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 307, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [27364], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27302, "user_id": 1003, "topic_id": 5091, "post_number": 10, "raw": "<b>done!</b>\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9349720e89686dbed99ecee8a00ba134c2a08eb0.jpg\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\n<img alt=\"smiley\" height=\"23\" src=\"/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png\" title=\"smiley\" width=\"23\">\n\n", "created_at": "2015-12-26 10:11:32", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:30.885967", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 56, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [26907], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27596, "user_id": 2464, "topic_id": 4980, "post_number": 11, "raw": "<b>Good point</b>\n\nYou are absolutely right, and a bit wrong :-)\n\nThe value of visualization strongly depends on the motivation one has to explore the data.

A dozen participants ended up being hosted for free,\u00a0we also went to\u00a0co-design\u00a0event sessions with Materani, calculate ingredients and\u00a0costs for the Pasta Party, get hold of fabrics for the session on codesigning unMonasterians uniforms\u00a0and many more.
