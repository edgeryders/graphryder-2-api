Hashtags: \\#futurespotters \\#Bucharest</em>\n\n<em>Last updated: July 6th\u00a0</em>\n\nBelow is a selection of most unique voices from the online community, whose protagonists shared their individual stories and aspirations. We believe they reflect a need to work together more closely and overcome as a community obstacles to receiving support for projects or barriers in the Romanian mentality which encourage individualism versus communitarianism. Building upon these insights means coming back to the citizens with a proposal to follow up on the Spot the Future pilot project, scaling it and engaging many more such citizens in concrete opportunities to work together: community project incubation, international residencies, open calls for mobility experiences and knowledge exchange programs at European level. \u00a0\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">A. On the need to come together in a community</h3>\n\nBucharest needs to organise its enthusiastic people better, because a lot of the time the energy dissipates only because you don't have someone to support you with a kind word, with an idea; not everyone has a large group of friends ready to do anything for a project just because it's interesting and possibly, with no financial rewards. And this is how another unicorn dies. <a href=\"/t/bine-v-am-gasit/4405\">(Petru)</a>\n\nThere is no established forum where young people with initiative could meet up to discuss their ideas and support each other (Roxana_Calarasu); Individuals coming together to co-create could have an important say in relation to future societal developments (Atzu)\n\n\"..more than ever, in Bucharest it is necessary that people with interesting projects to be themselves part of a community. There are a lot of people with great initiatives who work passionately on their ideas, but being dispersed it\u2019s hard for their projects to grow and gain relevance\" <a href=\"/t/breaking-barriers-organizing-together/4409\">(Ana Ungurianu)</a>\n\nMy resume is kind of outdated because I don`t change jobs, all involvement in various projects was triggered by talking to those who wanted it done and showing some skills instead of letting them read a piece of paper. That is why [] there was a real need for [Spot the Future] in Romania. I know there are more people of the sorts you are looking for but have not been brought together under the same entity in order to have a specific voice, to follow certain objectives to bring about genuine change. <a href=\"/t/tired-of-hearing-that-we-can-t/4437\">(IulianSirbu)</a>\n\nI think that we can create a larger impact only if we\u2019re together. So this is what I\u2019m concerned with - how do we gather to build. In small networks at first. Those, together, grow larger, and slowly we reach everyone. If we\u2019re talking about communities, the hardest thing at first was to create awareness. People must first have a reason to listen to something new, to participate, and afterwards, to stay\u00a0<a href=\"/t/its-all-about-people/4425\">(Icey)</a>\n\nA few years ago me and my NGO, Poiana lui Iocan embarked in a somewhat similar project, of trying to understand what is the core of our grassroots initiatives in Romania, what are the strategies, how to they communicate and interact with one another and most importantly how do they actually allow people to participate and engage outside their group. At the time though, I think there were other dots to connect, for our NGO, for the innovators that didn't see themselves as a community that could strive through collaboration and for me who just finished architecture and wanted to get more into understanding cities through interdisciplinary interactions. I think now is a better time to start this. <a href=\"/t/mapping-the-grassroots-that-not-many-believe-we-have/4407\">(RazvanZamfira)</a>\n\nI find that Bucharest is hosting a very active hipster movement with very progressive political views, and is also a place where several innovative projects are coming to life. However, despite the motivation and excellent execution of these innovators, for such initiatives to succeed, Bucharest still lacks a solid support ecosystem that can accelerate change and make it more collaborative. The large majority of the population ignores the existence of these initiatives, because we need more networkers, nurturers, investigators, communicators and resisters that can help social change gain momentum. (<a href=\"/u/manu_babele\">@MANU_BABELE</a>)\n\nI have a lot of creative people around me and I\u2019m trying to bring them closer to our organisation and what we are trying to do because NGO people tend to be like a sect sometimes. They don\u2019t go outside their circles, they chase their own tails. I\u2019m trying to get them to chase other people\u2019s tails. (<a href=\"/u/yozness\">@yozness</a>)\n\nYou can handle projects, events, communication, partnerships, accounting documents, contracts and financing at the same time. You can learn about them all by taking one at the time and asking for help where you can't manage. Just don't start with 'it can't be done.' (<a href=\"/u/iarina_stefanescu\">@Iarina_Stefanescu</a>)\n\nThrough this event and the people who participated, speakers and audience, we can say there\u2019s a true will of joining forces and creating an ecosystem, so let\u2019s start this intellectual, innovative revolution together! - <a href=\"http://blog.babele.co/ouishared-drinks-in-bucharest-whats-next/\">@Raluca_Marinescu at Babele</a>.\n\n<span>B. Obstacles we need to overcome to making change happen</span>\n\n<strong>1. A lot of people care about change in society but they are disconnected, they need community as a space for honest interaction. </strong>\n\nOn need for true openness: we need a space where we can join in easily: currently even in the NGO areas or established groups it is hard to find the access point, you can\u2019t just walk into a context and ask questions or get involved (conversation with Ana Ungurianu). Online collaborative communities need a lot of help growing and becoming independent; people need time to develop intrinsic motivation (Atzu)\n\nIt is challenging to be able to pay the bills and at the same time to show interest into creating a good habitat for future generations. The most important challenge I seem to face at the moment is a lack of call to action. A lot of thinking about oneself and not the one within the group. We live in a socially disrupted context, with social media filled with selfies, fueling each ego. (<a href=\"/t/tired-of-hearing-that-we-can-t/4437\">Iulian</a>)\n\nWe need to join our forces and have more visible actions in order to attract the attention of local communities and also for mobilizing others, and for that to happen we must show them we are able to make a change regardless of what material resources we have, but only by working together, sharing knowledge and resources, and also having a entrepreneurial approach for monetizing the ideas. (<a href=\"/u/elena_oglinda\">@Elena_Oglinda</a>)\n\n<strong>2. Aiming to produce change needs to be genuine, and needs to start from a small connected group, then grow into a larger one.</strong>\n\nOne of the best methods so far is to actually do things with a small number of people that progressively grows. We all want to help, to contribute, but it\u2019s important to have first results. Yes, it takes patience and ambition. As in anything. But it can be made (Icey).\u00a0What is worth and not worth investing time into? Even the word 'investing' has a relative in ROI - the return of investment. Let us not develop projects for already or future corporate individuals to find a 'extra-curricular free time' activity, but something that has a reason to believe, that actively involves and helps others (Iulian Sirbu)\n\nMy biggest question now is how to build resilient teams that manage to withstand uncertainty and that's what I\u2019m coming to the \\#Futurespotters workshop to learn (<a href=\"/t/a-game-of-resource-tag-in-bucharest-you-re-it/4487\">Alex\u00a0</a>)\n\nMaking fiscal education sexy is no easy task when everybody hates the IRS and the Ministry of Finance. Getting citizens involved takes time, and that\u2019s hard for me to accept, I\u2019m so impatient that I end up pushing for progress and change. (<a href=\"/t/walking-the-walk-towards-funky-citizenry/4613\">Cosmin Pojoranu</a>)\n\n<strong>3. Working for change should not be all non-profit and taken as a given, because it re-inforces the status quo.</strong>\u00a0\n\nIt is challenging to pay your bills AND look after making other people better (Gabi, Iulian). Marginalized groups must be supported into witnessing what are the current\u00a0possibilities\u00a0and how creativity and hard work can help bring projects to life. Time and energy should not all be non-profit (Iulian Sirbu).\n\nRomanians have a difficulty in understanding and appreciating the value you bring to a garbage, turning it into something useful. They can\u2019t picture the whole process: cleaning it up, setting it up, painting it, preparing the auxiliary materials, manufacturing etc. All by hand. All this requires time and effort. Which costs. (Irina Breniuc)\u00a0\n\n'I can't do X because I have no money,' is the wrong way to frame things. You should first have an idea, test it out with a few people, and then if it\u2019s good enough, money will flow. I think of an NGO as a start-up; fail early, learn, keep going (Cosmin Pojoranu).\n\n<strong>4. If you operate in a specific field e.g. institutionalized, innovation needs to be argued for in iterations.</strong>\u00a0You don't know what works and need time and manpower to test it!\u00a0\n\n[urban development]\u00a0It is this mix that makes urban development in itself start to make sense not the way it is now, closed up in its own institutional box. I think it is this where we have a lot more work to do and it\u2019s not because we don't know who to ask for help but rather because we are a very small team and talking about urban development in itself is a hard to tackle subject and we are constantly thinking of new ways in which to make it more understandable and friendly. A good example of a mix of local initiatives and our activities was this event we held at Cinema Favorit in Drumul Taberei. (Razvan Zamfirei)\n\n[emerging fields like recycling for a new economy]\u00a0How do you deal with upcycling?\u00a0Haven\u2019t found an answer yet. However, patience must be used as a weapon. Why? Because it\u2019s a new domain and any new domain, there are tons of unanswered questions. (Irina Breniuc)\n\n<strong>5. Projects and causes don't have to compete for support nor make it about charity.</strong>\u00a0\n\nIf you intend to get external financing for an upcycling business, you\u2019ll have to persuade CSR officers or other social investors that what you plan to do is worth investing in. Because what they\u2019ll be asking themselves is: what kind of NGO are you if you don\u2019t specifically aim at helping people in need? Definitely, environmental concers will never be as catchy and newsworthy as taking care of children with cancer. However, it mustn\u2019t be. There\u2019s enough for both. We just have to find a way to share resources. (<a href=\"/u/irina_breniuc\">@Irina_Breniuc</a>)\n\n<strong>6. Some projects take a village to make it work</strong>.\u00a0\u201cYes, I\u2019d want to be able to support myself out of this, but if it doesn\u2019t work out I\u2019ll have to change path. But of course I\u2019d love that... The plan is turning the garage into a ceramic workshop, and build a small house. I wanted an earthship house, a passive house consuming very little, with an interior garden... well, a live organism. Afterwards the idea changed, because Romania is too exotic for the idea of earthship. I still hope to build my own house but for this I need money, and currently I only do gardening to get a sense of it.\u201d Crina admits her biggest challenge is to bring people in to help her organize and make the gardening work more efficient.\u00a0So without a plan but however part of a movement of sorts, it made me think that Crina can\u2019t afford to take it upon her shoulders and turn her lifestyle into a mission for the sake of it; she is also awaiting an opportunity to go completely rural. There is nothing that her own land and kid whom she\u2019ll be homeschooling could not make up for (Crina Cranta).\n\nWe can grow the social economy and social entrepreneurial mindsets - from legal standpoint up to fighting for a change in mentality and teaching ourselves to collectively overcome the ideea that NGOs are a service for \u201cbeneficiaries\u201d. We need smart activism, smart marketing.

I facilitate and participate in open research projects and teach children and adults alike about biosciences.\n\nResearch is an important driver for progress in healthcare. It brings us cheaper medicine, cures to seemingly incurable diseases and better therapies.\n\nYet research methods have not evolved much at all to better reflect the needs of patients and citizens. The people whom the research is essentially meant for, are largely left out of the process. Moreover, the outcomes are often shielded behind intellectual property law or unaffordable prices. Citizen science and open science are research philosophies that offer an alternative.\n\nCitizen science as an approach is overwhelmingly commonly reduced to an alternative method for collecting data. I was at a conference dedicated to citizen science a few months ago; a full programme, even quite diverse for most standards, and data collection and data quality were all anyone wanted to talk about.\n\n<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-1eb7c3e1-ba92-8650-e329-3411ea128682\">Insight only progresses if\u00a0we ask the right questions.</b>\n\nAt the conference not a word was spoken about better ways of actively <strong>listening to citizens</strong> every step of the way. <strong>Closely involving patients</strong> was missing from virtually every research agenda.\n\nIn OpenCare I saw plenty of initiatives that are successful at taking citizen-led and open research to the next level. Biohackers are producing <a href=\"/t/how-open-insulin-works-to-open-source-science-and-medicine/519\">open source insulin</a>, researchers in Greece are <a href=\"/t/openandchange-sc-fy-aplies-and-offers-scientific-knowledge-for-free/495\">putting almost-forgotten research to use for everyone</a> and people with motor impairment are coming together with researchers to develop <a href=\"/t/wehandu-maker-space-for-developing-solutions-for-cases-of-motor-impairment/687\">open source neuroprosthetics</a> in maker spaces.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things however, these examples are few and far between.

We will bring the protagonists in a community of care and support and lend them a global voice, attempting to make a contribution to more grounded development programmes, while giving participants increased credibility and legitimacy in the process.\u00a0<span>\u00a0</span>\n\n<strong>Concept</strong>\n\nIn complex societies, change tends to start at the edge. Individuals farther away from the mainstream are less shielded from systemic change (mass unemployment, ecological crises, etc.), and therefore harder pressed to respond and adapt to it; at the same time, they are also less constrained by \"business as usual\". In the 21st century, the spread of hacker culture \u2013 with its emphasis on DIY, knowledge sharing and technological progress has turned on a spotlight on a small but influential minority of social innovators, activists and technologists that are emerging as a massive, distributed R&amp;D lab for the global society. There is much to be gained from a constructive dialog between the center, where policies are decided upon, and the edge, where people at the forefront of change and adaptation are gathering precious data on what change really looks like from the inside. However, bootstrapping and sustaining such dialog is challenging. Profoundly different world views and experiences separate policy makers and innovators at the edge; a history of mutual mistrust makes each side weary of engaging with the other.\n\nEdgeryders grows out of a joint Council of Europe/European Commission project to bridge this gulf. The approach we advocate \u2013 and that we have successfully deployed elsewhere \u2013 is based on three main activities:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>traversing the social graph</strong> to reach cutting-edge trends and their protagonists just as they happen. Social innovators, hackers, civic hackers and activists tend to be a global community, connected across the planet by personal ties. We make use of the many edgeryders who are themselves part of it to identify individuals in Armenia, Egypt and Georgia to act as entry points to the networks of innovators in those countries; and of the social Internet to traverse the social graph, using their early involvement to signal to other, less visible innovators what we are doing.</li>\n\n<li><strong>peer-to-peer validation</strong> through a curated online conversation. Cutting-edge projects and experiences are shared on an online platform optimized for meaningful conversation, with unrestricted (but moderated) comments. This means that the Spot The Future (STF) community functions as its own validation mechanism: anything written by one user can be corroborated or challenged by all other users. This is the same mechanism at work in open source software development, that famously prompted Linus Torvalds to remark that \"given enough eyeballs, all errors are shallow\". This assures highest quality and timely error- and bias detection.</li>\n\n<li><strong>conversation harvesting through online ethnography and network analysis techniques</strong>. Qualitative (ethnographic) analysis is deployed on the many voices participating into the online STF conversation, to identify the trends and criticalities that innovators at the edge in Armenia, Egypt and Georgia find most compelling. We supplement this with quantitative indicators: social network indicators (computed on the conversation, not on mainstream social networks) to best assess the influence of individual participants, and content network indicators (such as H-indices) to best assess the depth and the breadth of the peer-to-peer validation processes underpinning each contribution to the conversation.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>The social and technical infrastructure\u00a0</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>web</strong> <strong>platform:</strong> we\u2019re taking on the fast, cost-effective solution to deploy the project on a dedicated section of the Edgeryders platform \u2013 open, already populated and fully customizable; we\u2019ll set up a group and fit it with support for multiple languages and one-click machine-translation;</li>\n\n<li><strong>engagement:</strong> any distributed foresight effort needs a way to attract and engage many contributors. In the case of STF there is a further complication: the exercise happens across multiple countries and multiple languages. Our way to address this is by working with engagement managers in each country \u2013 individuals who are well embedded in the local context and can point us at people doing interesting work.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Seeding content</strong>: we\u2019ll target key contributors ahead of the project launch and make sure their posts are well articulated and inspiring enough to attract more participation</li>\n\n<li><strong>Community management</strong>: we employ an experienced community manager to assist new participants in the onboarding process and help them become protagonists of the conversation (guidelines: http://goo.gl/DuiVf2).</li>\n\n<li><strong>Narrative weaving:</strong> the Big Epic Goal uniting participants in the project will guide engagement efforts and be visible on communications all throughout the project</li>\n\n<li><strong>the existing 2,000-strong Edgeryders community are all invited to participate</strong> and help accommodate new members. The most interesting thing about the community is its diversity, and is sometimes key for nascent cross border, creative collaboration</li>\n\n<li>we <strong>deal with multiple languages</strong> as follows: key content (basic info, how-tos) will be in Armenian, Arabic, Georgian and English. Procured blog posts will be in the language of the country they refer to and English. Users will be given the choice to write in English or in any other language; one-click automated translation will be made available on the platform. A strong social norm of not looking down on anyone on the basis of spelling or grammar mistakes will be in place.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Research strategy</strong>\n\nThe final foresight report\u00a0will be produced by means of an open online ethnography exercise, with some quantitative reinforcements. Ethnographic methods are particularly well-suited to horizon-scanning exercises because they allow researchers to convey the point of view of the group being studied into the research. In the case of STF, this promotes constructive dialog between policy makers and innovators at the edge, as it makes explicit the different world views standing in the way of collaboration. Also, it tends to amplify weak signals by looking at (in this case) social innovation through the eyes of social innovators, taking on board the reasons why their initiators think these practices and experiences are important. For more details about this ask [Alberto].\n\n<strong>Final event in Tbilisi, Georgia\u00a0</strong>\n\nA three day Living on the Edge event (video: <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/82554988\">https://vimeo.com/82554988</a>), fostering mutual support and horizontal learning that gathers innovators from different parts of the world. The contents of the event will be based on the online conversation and co-designed by the STF community on its platform, by and with attendees. The event will be open for anyone who wishes to participate in it; especially active or inspiring contributors to the STF exercise will be funded to participate.\n\nWe aim to build the event around sharing of participants\u2019 experiences as full fledged experts in the social innovation scene, present the preliminary findings based on evidence from the online conversation, and finally, expand on participants knowledge and make it so that they together act as a mutual support network for innovators working outside structured/funded r&amp;d environments.\n\n<strong>Timeline (as of 28th February 2014)</strong>\n\n<table align=\"left\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"height:45px\">\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td style=\"background-color:rgb(204, 204, 204); height:41px; width:85px\">\n\n<strong>WHEN</strong>\n\n</td>\n\n<td style=\"background-color:rgb(204, 204, 204); height:41px; width:85px\">\n\n<strong>WHAT</strong>\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td style=\"height:54px; width:85px\">\n\nWEEK 1 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a024-28 February\n\n</td>\n\n<td style=\"height:54px; width:554px\">\n\nDELIVERABLE 1: Action plan specifying timeline of activities with a very specific set of actions to be taken for each country\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td rowspan=\"2\" style=\"height:54px; width:85px\">\n\nWEEK 2 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 3-7 March\n\n</td>\n\n<td style=\"height:54px; width:554px\">\n\nComplete the Spot the Future team with engagement managers, ethnographer and network analyst\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td style=\"height:54px; width:554px\">\n\nStart STF online platform preparation: customizing the web space\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"height:54px; width:85px\">\n\nWEEK 3 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 10-14 March\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n</td>\n\n<td style=\"height:54px; width:554px\">\n\nStart work on preliminary foresight report to incorporate post2015 global consultations findings and outline key areas of focus for each country\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td style=\"height:54px; width:554px\">\n\nContact trailblazers for paid blog posts: reach out to interesting innovators in each country, produce templates and guidelines for submission of texts\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td rowspan=\"3\" style=\"height:54px; width:85px\">\n\nWEEK 4 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 17-21 March\n\n</td>\n\n<td style=\"height:54px; width:554px\">\n\nProduce calls for participation in English (writing for engagement)\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td style=\"height:54px; width:554px\">\n\nTranslate calls for participation in Georgian, Armenian, Egyptian\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td style=\"height:54px; width:554px\">\n\nCreate engagement strategy to mobilize communities of innovators: adapt it to each country specifics (channels, tone, campaigning style)\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td rowspan=\"2\" style=\"height:54px; width:85px\">\n\nWEEK 5 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 24-28 March\n\n</td>\n\n<td style=\"height:54px; width:554px\">\n\nBuild the data model (define research protocols and tools to use)\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td style=\"height:54px; width:554px\">\n\nReview first batch of submitted paid posts (check that they're authentic accounts of experiences in innovation)\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td rowspan=\"3\" style=\"height:54px; width:85px\">\n\nWEEK 6 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 31 March-4 April\n\n</td>\n\n<td style=\"height:54px; width:554px\">\n\nBIG Platform launch\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td style=\"height:54px; width:554px\">\n\nDELIVERABLE 2: Launch preliminary foresight report online\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td style=\"height:54px; width:554px\">\n\nDeploy social media campaign across countries and the wider Edgeryders network\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td rowspan=\"2\" style=\"height:54px; width:85px\">\n\n<span>WEEKS 7-10\u00a0</span><span>(ongoing)</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n</td>\n\n<td style=\"height:54px; width:554px\">STF continuous engagement campaign, community management and platform maintenance</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td style=\"height:54px; width:554px\">\n\nWeekly blog posts on Spot the Future Armenia, Georgia, Egypt (each to be spread by engagement managers)\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td style=\"height:54px; width:85px\">\n\n7-11 APRIL\n\n</td>\n\n<td style=\"height:54px; width:554px\">\n\nSPOT THE FUTURE TOUR: workshops in Georgia, Armenia, Egypt - with UNDP and invited participants; content to be prepared online and each output to feed back onto the online conversation\u00a0\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td style=\"height:54px; width:85px\">\n\nWEEK 8\n\n<span>14-18 April</span>\n\n</td>\n\n<td style=\"height:54px; width:554px\">\n\nStart preparations for final event in Tbilisi - open event to engage with project contributors.<span>\u00a0How many paid spots?

It does not look like much. But it is. It is a very big deal indeed.\n\nThe MCCH saves people. It provides health care to down-on-their-luck Greeks who have no access to public health care and no money to pay for private clinics. There are many such people, because in Greece access to the national health service is tied to employment. When Greeks lose their jobs, they have a grace period of one year: they'd better find another job within that period, because if they don't they are out of health insurance. If they fall sick, they have to come up with something, or die.\n\nIt's not just Greeks. It turns out in every European Union countries but the United Kingdom and Italy, employment is a pre-requisite for access to health care. But Greece was hit hardest by the 2008 crisis: many more people than elsewhere have turned into long-term unemployed. Everyone is struggling: \u201cWe had poor people ten years ago, too \u2013 shrugs Maria, a psychologist volunteering at MCCH \u2013 but at that time people could fall back on their families, or their neighbors, for help. Not anymore: their families and neighbors are themselves in trouble, and there's little they can do. People are getting desperate.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, some senior doctors started comparing notes, and they saw a perfect health care storm brewing at the horizon. \u201cWe knew something very bad was coming, and people would die \u2013 says Maria \u2013 so we decided we must do something.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething\u201d in this case turned out to be the MCCH itself. This is a very strange animal as health care providers go.\n\n* [b]It has no legal existence[/b]. Its literature proudly proclaims: \u201c MCCH is a volunteer organization without Legal or Taxable status and it is not a 'Non-Profit-Making-Organisation'.\u201d Maria: \"We are technically illegal\".\n* [b]It does not accept donations in money[/b]. It does accept donations in kind: medicines, equipment, blood sample analyses.\n* [b]It operates from a building that belongs to the Municipality of Helliniko-Argyropoulis.[/b] Though none of its employees works in the building, the Municipality still pays the electricity and phone bills that the MCCH generates. My heart goes out to the anonymous \u201cbureaucrat hacker\u201d that entrusted a government building to an informal group of citizens, which by definition cannot sign contracts or participate in tenders.\n* [b]It is very autonomous with respect to institutions and power[/b]. MCCH was recently proposed for the European Parliament European Citizen's Prize 2015, but they very publicly turned it down. Reason: \"Europe is an important cause of the problem we exist to address. Don't give us awards, change your policy\".\n* [b]It treats only people who have no access to the public health care system[/b]. One exception: low-income families with many children, who are living hand-to-mouth on 450 euro a day and simply cannot afford to buy medicines (Maria: \u201cIt happens\u201d).\n* [b]On top of diagnosis/prognosis, MCCH supplies free medicines, baby food and nappies.[/b]\n* [b]It has 300 volunteers[/b], of which a little over half are doctors of various specialisations and pharmacists.\n* [b]It operates with practically no hierarchy and no management[/b]. People decide by themselves what role to play, by joining one of several groups (about 10 members to a group) which exist to carry on specific tasks (like onboarding new patients). An organising committee does its best to keep people on the same page. A weekly meeting votes on general issues. A mailing list deals with specific matters.\n* When they are not volunteering with MCCH, [b]volunteers exchange services and small favours through a time bank[/b]: two massages against one hour of English lessons etc.\n\n[b]There are now 68 such clinics in Greece[/b]. Take a moment to think about what this means: in four years, thousands of enterprising Greeks with no money, no command structure and who do not even know each other have created a parallel health care system that succeeds where the public health service and private sector services both fail: it keeps reasonably safe the poorest strata of the population. Notice that the Greek health care budget in 2011 was over 6 billion euro.\n\nWait. Self-organised people with no money and no organisation that beat credentialed, moneyed professionals at their own game? We've seen this before. It was Wikipedia outcompeting Encyclopedia Britannica. It was OpenStreetMap pushing to the curbs Garmin and TomTom. It was Facebook groups coordinating disaster relief after the Nepal 2015 earthquakes and the Tbilisi 2015 flash flood, way before the government and NGOs could get their act together. It was Internet-coordinated young newcomers changing the rules of the political game, and even bringing down entire regimes who seemed to have all the power and all the money, in Egypt, Tunisia and Ukraine.\n\nWe have a word for these phenomena: we call them disruption. They are associated with supplying goods or services in a new way, that substitutes collective intelligence and distributed effort for vertical organisations. This new way happens to be vastly more efficient than the old ones.\n\nI think the time has come for disruption in health care, and in care services in general. Why? Because, as the OECD pointed out, per capita health care expenditure grows much faster than GDP. In 1970, health care absorbed a respectable 5.2% of the GDP of the average OECD country. In 2008, it absorbed 10.1% (source). The system is under strain, and often \u2013 like in Greece, it reacts by denying care to those who most need it. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.cottica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Health_care_expenditure.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-12715\" src=\"http://www.cottica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Health_care_expenditure.gif\" alt=\"Health care expenditure in some OECD countries, 1970-2015\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\"></a>\n\nThis is morally unacceptable, wasteful and stupid \u2013 especially when the Metropolitan Community Clinic at Helliniko and so many other experiences like it, in the world of care and outside it, has proven how much farther communities can go in taking care of their members when they are enabled to do it.\n\nSo, we are getting involved. Edgeryders has partnered up with five world-class organisations in research (University of Bordeaux, Stockholm School of Economics, ScimPulse Foundation), welfare policy-making (City of Milan) and digital fabrication (WeMake) to find, learn from, and enhance the experiences like MCCH all around the world. Our goal is a model of community-driven care services, based on modern science and open technology, but with the low overhead and human touch that communities can provide and large bureaucracies cannot. Our project is called OpenCare; the European Commission has generously agreed to support it through its Collective Awareness Platforms programme.\n\nWhoever you are you are welcome to join us. After all, if you are human, you have considerable experience of giving and receiving care, and that makes you an expert.

Non sembra molto impressionante. Ma lo \u00e8. \u00c8 un luogo molto importante.\n\nLa MCCH salva vite. Fornisce assistenza sanitaria a persone sfortunate che non hanno accesso alla sanit\u00e0 pubblica, n\u00e9 denaro per pagarsi quella privata. Ci sono molte persone in questa situazione, perch\u00e9 in Grecia l'accesso al servizio sanitario nazionale \u00e8 legato all'occupazione. Quando un greco perde il lavoro, mantiene l'assistenza sanitaria per un anno: se dopo un anno non ha trovato un altro lavoro, perde il diritto di accesso al servizio sanitario nazionale. Se si ammala, deve inventarsi qualcosa, o morire.\n\nNon sono solo i  greci. In tutti i paesi europei, tranne il Regno Unito e l'Italia, la condizione di occupato \u00e8 un pre-requisito per accedere all'assistenza sanitaria. Ma la Grecia \u00e8 stata colpita pi\u00f9 duramente dalla crisi del 2008: molte pi\u00f9 persone che altrove si sono trasformate in disoccupati a lungo termine. \"C'erano poveri anche dieci anni fa \u2013 ci dice Maria, una psicologa che fa volontariato a MCCH \u2013 ma a quel tempo le persone in difficolt\u00e0 potevano chiedere aiuto alle famiglie, o ai vicini. Oggi anche le loro famiglie e i loro vicini sono in difficolt\u00e0, e non possono fare molto per aiutare gli altri. La gente \u00e8 disperata.\"\n\nNel 2011, alcuni medici hanno cominciato a confrontare le loro esperienze, e hanno visto una tempesta perfetta prepararsi all'orizzonte. \"Sapevamo che qualcosa di molto brutto era in arrivo, e che della gente sarebbe morta \u2013 racconta Maria \u2013 Quindi abbiamo deciso che dovevamo fare qualcosa.\n\n\"Qualcosa in questo caso \u00e8 risultato essere la MCCH stessa. Si tratta di uno strano animale nello zoo dell'assistenza sanitaria.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Non esiste legalmente</strong>. Il suo materiale proclama fieramente: \"MCCH \u00e8 un'organizzazione volontaria senza status legale e non tassabile, e non \u00e8 una 'organizzazione not for profit'.\"  (Maria: \"Tecnicamente siamo illegali\".)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Non accetta donazioni in denaro</strong>. Accetta invece donazioni in natura: medicine, attrezzatura, analisi di campioni di sangue.</li>\n\n<li>Occupa una palazzina di propriet\u00e0 del Comune di Helliniko-Argyropoulis. <strong>Nonostante nessuno dei suoi dipendenti lavori l\u00ec, il Comune paga le bollette dell'elettricit\u00e0 e del telefono generate da MCCH</strong>. Il mio cuore batte per l'anonimo \"burocrate hacker\" che ha consegnato un edificio pubblico a un gruppo informale di cittadini, che per definizione non pu\u00f2 e non vuole firmare contratti o partecipare a bandi.</li>\n\n<li><strong>\u00c8 molto autonoma rispetto alle istituzioni e al potere</strong>. MCCH \u00e8 stata proposta per un riconoscimento del Parlamento Europeo chiamato European Citizen's Prize 2015, ma l'ha rifiutato in modo molto pubblico. Motivazione: \"L'Europa \u00e8 una delle cause del problema che esistiamo per risolvere. Non dateci premi, cambiate la vostra politica.\"</li>\n\n<li><b>Tratta solo pazienti che non hanno accesso al servizio sanitario nazionale</b>. Un'eccezione: famiglie numerose a basso reddito, che vivono con 450 euro al mese e semplicemente non hanno denaro per le medicine. (Maria: \"Succede.\")</li>\n\n<li><strong>Oltre a diagnosi/prognosi, MCCH fornisce medicine, cibo per neonati e pannolini gratis</strong>.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Ha 300 volontari</strong>, di cui un po' pi\u00f9 della met\u00e0 sono medici di varie specializzazioni e farmacisti.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Funziona praticamente senza gerarchie e senza managers. </strong>Ciascun volontario decide da solo in quale ruolo impegnarsi. Lo fa unendosi a un gruppo: ciascun gruppo ha circa 10 membri e esiste per occuparsi di svolgere un compito specifico (per esempio c'\u00e8 un gruppo di accoglienza nuovi pazienti). Un comitato organizzativo fa del suo meglio per tenere ciascun gruppo informato e allineato con gli altri. Una riunione settimanale vota su temi generali. Una mailing list si occupa di temi specifici.</li>\n\n<li>Quando non fanno volontariato con MCCH, <strong>i volontari si scambiano servizi e piccoli favori attraverso una banca del tempo</strong>: due massaggi contro un'ora di lezione di inglese etc.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Oggi ci sono 68 cliniche organizzate cos\u00ec in Grecia</strong>. Prendetevi un momento per assorbire le implicazioni di questo fatto: in quattro anni, migliaia di greci intraprendenti, senza denaro, senza una struttura di comando, senza neppure conoscersi, hanno creato un servizio sanitario parallelo che riesce dove il servizio sanitario pubblico e la sanit\u00e0 privata falliscono: mantiene in relativa sicurezza gli strati pi\u00f9 poveri della popolazione. Da notare: lo stato greco ha speso in sanit\u00e0 oltre 6 miliardi di euro nel 2011.\n\nAspetta un attimo. Masse di persone auto-organizzate, senza soldi e senza organizzazioni, che battono professionisti attentamente selezionati e ben pagati sul loro terreno? Scena gi\u00e0 vista. Era Wikipedia che strabatteva Encyclopedia Britannica. Era OpenStreetMap che, regalando i propri dati, vaporizzava il business di Garmin e TomTom. Erano gruppi su Facebook che coordinavano le iniziative di soccorso poche ore dopo il terremoto in Nepal e l'inondazione di Tbilisi di questa primavera. Erano i giovani inesperti e coordinati via Internet che cambiavano le regole del gioco politico, arrivando ad abbattere interi regimi in Egitto, Tunisia e Ucraina.\n\nAbbiamo una parola per questi fenomeni: li chiamiamo <em>disruption.</em> Sono associati con la produzione di beni o servizi in un modo nuovo, che sostituisce le organizzazioni verticali con l'intelligenza collettiva e lo sforzo distribuito. Accade che questo modo nuovo \u00e8 enormemente pi\u00f9 efficiente di quelli vecchi.\n\nCredo che sia arrivato il tempo della <em>disruption</em> nell'assistenza sanitaria, e nei servizi di cura in generale. Perch\u00e9? Perch\u00e9, come ha spiegato l'OCSE, la spesa sanitaria pro capite cresce molto pi\u00f9 in fretta del reddito prodotto. Nel 1970, la sanit\u00e0 assorbiva un rispettabile 5.2% del PIL del paese sviluppato medio. Nel 2008 ne assorbiva il 10.1% (<a href=\"http://kff.org/health-costs/issue-brief/snapshots-health-care-spending-in-the-united-states-selected-oecd-countries/\">fonte</a>). Il sistema \u00e8 sotto stress, e spesso \u2013 come in Grecia \u2013 reagisce negando i servizi a chi ne ha pi\u00f9 bisogno.\n\nQuesto \u00e8 moralmente inaccettabile, dissipativo e stupido \u2013 specialmente quando la Metropolitan Community Clinic di Helliniko, e molte altre esperienze simili, hanno mostrato la capacit\u00e0 delle comunit\u00e0 di prendersi cura dei propri membri quando si permette loro di farlo.\n\nQuindi, ci mettiamo in gioco. La mia nanoimpresa sociale, <a href=\"/company/home\">Edgeryders</a>, si \u00e8 associata con cinque organizzazioni di classe mondiale nella ricerca (Univerist\u00e0 di Bordeaux, Stockholm School of Economics, ScimPulse Foundation) nelle politiche sociali (Comune di Milano) e nella fabbricazione digitale (WeMake) per trovare le esperienze come MCCH in tutto il mondo, imparare da loro, e se possibile perfezionarne il modello. Il nostro obiettivo \u00e8 contribuire a un modello di servizi di cura <em>community-driven, </em> basati sulla scienza e la tecnologia moderna, ma con i bassi costi amministrativi e il tocco umano che le comunit\u00e0 hanno e le grandi burocrazie, sia pubbliche che private, no. Il nostro progetto si chiama <a href=\"/opencare/welcome-to-opencare\">OpenCare</a>; la Commissione Europea ci ha creduto abbastanza da sostenerlo attraverso il programma <em>Collective Awareness Platforms.</em>\n\nChiunque tu sia, sei il o la benvenuta a unirti a noi. Dopo tutto, noi umani, tutti, abbiamo un'esperienza considerevole nel dare e nel ricevere cura, e questo fa di noi degli esperti. Se vuoi partecipare , o semplicemente saperne di pi\u00f9, <a href=\"/opencare/welcome-to-opencare\">parti da qui</a>.\n\n<em>Foto: Theophilos Papadopoulos su flickr.com</em>", "created_at": "2015-10-26 10:43:16", "updated_at": "2018-05-26 07:01:10.171065", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2517, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 111.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14305, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 4934, "post_number": 5, "raw": "I am trying to schedule it;) hopefully this week it will finally work out.

Over four years, 3,000 people have contributed about\u00a04,000 posts and 16,000 comments. That's a lot of content.\u00a0But what about quality?\u00a0\n\nThis is an important question. At Edgeryders we care about the quality of written conversation. We believe there is such a thing as collective intelligence.\u00a0\n\nIn Edgeryders, we like to think of online communities as social networks of interactions. There's an advantage to this: you can visualize the whole thing as one single visual object. Brain cortex is good at processing visual signals, and we all get the basic idea of a\u00a0network. Things connected by relationships: how hard can it be? With networks, most people can experience effortless\u00a0understanding of\u00a0mathematical statements, <em>just by looking</em>.\u00a0\n\nIf you could look at your online community's network, what would you see? Here are some examples.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Most users belong to one or more \"islands\", but the\u00a0islands are not connected to each other. Users in one islands have no contact with\u00a0users in other islands. So, they could be in disagreement and not have noticed. Or two groups\u00a0could\u00a0be working on the exact same\u00a0thing, with each group unaware of the other.\u00a0 We found this topology in\u00a0the Python Italian mailing list. The French Fablab mailing list has a similar structure, with one difference: three users \"bridging\" between the two components.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e6f2cec665b379bd7b1a01ce235588528e89817b.jpeg\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Some \"superstar\" users play a large role in connecting many fellow community members to the conversation. Others cluster in small groups and do not take part in the life of the greater community. Others still are isolated: they wrote content, but are not interacting with anyone. You can find examples of all three types of users in Innovatori PA, an Italian community of public sector innovators.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a2b9fbeafe89c21b24e946efdc34e18e86fe9f41.jpeg\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\nEdgesense is an application that represents online communities as networks of interaction. We developed it\u00a0for, and with, online community managers. Its advantages:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Access\u00a0via browser. No installation required.</li>\n\n<li>Inline help\u00a0and tutorial to help you interpret the main network concepts involved. The idea is to <em>not</em>\u00a0trivialize a complex topic, but rather give online community managers a taste for network science.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Full interactivity. Pan, zoom, search, try different visualizations.</li>\n\n<li>Accounts for the role of community managers. How effective are they in bringing users together?</li>\n\n<li>Shows changes in near-real time. The network is redrawn from fresh data every day.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Open data ready. Makes it easy to release your conversation graph as open data.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nEdgeryders is one of the first online communities ever to adopt Edgesense. We like it so much we have decided to \u00a0let everyone, not just community managers, play with it. From now on, the Edgesense dashboard will be accessible from the main menu. <a href=\"/sites/all/modules/contrib/edgesense/static/dashboard.html\">Click here</a> to see it right now. Don't worry: you cannot break anything.\u00a0\n\nSeveral alpha testers report they like to look themselves up in the network. Some have even posted online \"network selfies\", in which they appear together with their ego networks. You can do the same by using the search button to look yourself up. As you make new friends in Edgeryders, you'll see your ego network grow (allow 24 hours for the script to update). Where are you in the conversation network?\n\nEdgesense is free and open source software, \u00a0developed by Italian NGO <a href=\"http://www.wikitalia.org/2015/12/10/catalyst-is-over-long-live-edgesense/\">Wikitalia</a> as part of the <a href=\"http://catalyst-fp7.eu\">CATALYST project</a>, with <a href=\"/u/luca_mearelli\">@Luca_Mearelli</a>\u00a0as the lead developer and myself as network geek-in-residence.\u00a0Stefano <a href=\"/u/moe\">@MoE</a>\u00a0Cieri ported it to BuddyPress.\u00a0If you want to install it, we recommend you start at the <a href=\"https://github.com/Wikitalia/edgesense\">GitHub repository</a>. Among other things, it sports a <a href=\"https://github.com/Wikitalia/edgesense/wiki\">wiki</a> with practical information. Online community managers might want to start <a href=\"https://github.com/Wikitalia/edgesense/wiki/Using-Edgesense-for-online-community-management\">here</a>.\u00a0\n\nEdgesense is cool, but it not where it all ends. We will develop it further. Much further, I hope.\u00a0This is important. I suspect\u00a0networks are the key to\u00a0finding the mathematical signature of collective intelligence.\u00a0It's just a hunch, but a long one: I have been following it for many years now (I even did\u00a0<a href=\"https://youtu.be/KKrM2c-ww_k\">a TEDx talk</a>\u00a0on it). If we find this signature, we can use it \u00a0as a benchmark to \"train\" online communities into getting smarter and smarter. The beauty of this plan is this: the smarts of communities does\u00a0not depend much on the smarts of their members. All the action is in the way people are connected to each other. In a sense, it's\u00a0like the brain itself: a person's intelligence does not depend much on the quality of its neurons. Neurons are all basically the same, biological off-the-shelf components. What matters is the wiring,\u00a0the patterns of connectivity across neurons.\u00a0\n\nThat's the future. meanwhile, have fun with Edgesense. We appreciate feedback, suggestions or help with improving it.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-01-04 21:23:53", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 23:31:24.880747", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1027, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 136.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2448, 1543], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23460, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 1354, "post_number": 10, "raw": "<b>Your message to policy makers?</b>\n\nHi Justin,\n\nNot sure if you heard about the latest here, we're trying to build collaboratively a handbook \u00a0for the community of policy makers based on Edgeryders and young Europeans alike who find themselves at the avant garde of change.\n\nRight now we're at the point where we sum up how people here in the community are making a living, and of course innovation and entrepreneurship play a big role.

It came down <span>(for developers)</span>\u00a0to ensuring interoperability, and (for lawyers) to focus on enabling, rather than restricting, users. That does not mean it should not be considered as an option: we could decide to enable non-commercial licenses (or, on the contrary, full copyright). There is a price to pay: this rules out my solution 1, and additionally \u2013 I fear \u2013 is very difficult to enforce in the long run.\n\nPlease understand that this is more about sharing a space than it is about legals. Nobody can stop any Edgeryders user from writing something like:\n\n<code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">The sentence in red in this post is licensed under a GNU General Public License.</code>\n\nThis is legally valid: I have just broken interoperability on the platform. However,\u00a0in practice, the platform does not know that:\u00a0it is up to social interaction and negotiation to enforce that license. Example: <a href=\"/u/mariabyck\">@mariabyck</a>\u00a0objected to have her posts contribute to the ethnography of stewardship we are preparing for the Rockefeller Foundation. That was solvable and solved, but it required a specific conversation. In two years, researchers from the University of Nevada or something could be scouring the web and doing ethnography on her posts, and it would be legal to do so under the terms of the license. My personal opinion is: it is probably simpler and safer that, if you do not mean to release open content, you do not use Edgeryders at all for it.\n\nI suggest you speak with <a href=\"/u/matthias\">@Matthias</a>, who is clearest on the hidden long-run difficulties of\u00a0<em>maintaining</em>\u00a0solutions and not just <em>building\u00a0</em>them... as I was writing this comment I see he has come online.\n\nIt is definitely a good idea to make legals accessible from every page.

It was pointed out\u00a0that the problems of the world feel\u00a0like an insurmountable tsunami. And that\u00a0a crucial part of unlocking intertia is surfacing existing alternatives for getting involved and making them visible in the sense that\u00a0\"if you care about this, then you can get engaged there\". Another key thing to remember is the importance of space for multiplicity of calls to action,\u00a0many things in parallel appeals to different groups and contexts. Here also the power of the arts was mentioned,\u00a0a case study\u00a0: project happening around ponti for empowering girls to know how to react if they are theatended\n\nAs soon as this diiscussion picked up the group members\u00a0got into the core questions: \"\u00a0What have you got? How much time can you give for free? What skills have you got?\u00a0and what would you like to get involved?\"\n\nA group of people in a network can make big things happen if there is<strong>\u00a0bonding, bridging and linking going\u00a0</strong>on.\u00a0Edgeryders: hosts all three processes and\u00a0creates the contexts that draw all three to work in the same direction. People interacting on\u00a0the platform and\u00a0social protocols, foster\u00a0behaviours amongst participants that makes community stronger in all three features.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Bonding: Building and maintaining social glue between participants: connect people together and create sense of community</li>\n\n<li>Bridging: Connecting \u00a0different communities</li>\n\n<li>Linking: Interacing with power and resources</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nFor those interested there is an ongoing discussion on how to leverage creative networked communities for more impact on Edgeryders ahead of \\#LOTE3 \u00a0the third annual edgeryders community event taking place on October 29 -November 32. You can join\u00a0the discussion\u00a0<a href=\"/t/leveraging-creative-networked-communities-for-impact/1148\">here</a>.\n\n<h3>Ideas for work that could be done by\u00a0participants</h3>\n\n<h4>1. Mapping unconscious waste and finding new ways of using it...</h4>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>What do we mean by common space, what does it mean to us?\u00a0How are they used and abused?</li>\n\n<li><span>There\u00a0is an abundance of\u00a0</span><span>biomass not being made use of\u00a0in SA:\u00a0In northern suburbs we generate more biomass in form of grass cuttings then dumped whereas this is valuable resource than can be used to fertilise soil in the city\u00a0</span></li>\n\n<li>Roak uses materials he\u00a0is familiar with and manipulates them: \"I'll\u00a0install it in interesting location, people passing by would see something they are not familiar with it. It will mess with their sense off reality, a subconscious moment.\"</li>\n\n<li>looking at spaces in a different lightassumption of how we use space, we assume that others are not using space that is here, but maybe it\u2019s us that are not using space. The exception in pretoria is where the middle class go about their lives, e.g. shopping malls.</li>\n\n<li>Setting up activities in places where you don' expect to find them, uncurated spaces</li>\n\n<li>Occupying an unused space, easiest spaces to occupy are public. Check Joburg property company and the Heritage foundation. Houses at the Edge of delta park. How fast could this be done?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h4>2. Mapping where better alternatives in terms of education and skill development are already being tested ...</h4>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>problems with education and skills utilisation. This was\u00a0boiled down to youth being pushed to make career choices very early in life with result you have people sitting in careers you hate. There was no career guidance early in life</li>\n\n<li>everyone comes from difft background, different levels of choice</li>\n\n<li>some ideas to help to make some change:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><span>Teaching\u00a0them to be more self sustainable: to free up budget\u00a0otherwise used from food by setting up school gardens to be farmed by the kids?\u00a0\u00a0City Farm. Case study mentioned: Somewhere </span>land around the schools was given to residents for\u00a0farming.</li>\n\n<li>Giving\u00a0young people\u00a0opportunities\u00a0to be exposed to different fields and areas of knowledge: ,\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>most people dont have access to broadband\u00a0build community centres within schools,</li>\n\n<li>how do we support the skills and \u00a0talents of youth ealy in life. E.g\u00a0\u00a0Moleque des ideas</li>\n\n<li>setting up a series of talks for and by kids, where we get people to speak to the kids.</li>\n\n</ul></li>\n\n</ul></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h4>3. Creating a pan-African, p2p network</h4>\n\nIt was pointed out that the kind of cohesion we have started forming in the workshop\u00a0could be useful in other parts of Africa, that we could be the bridge, that one could\u00a0create\u00a0a model of sucess to generate more success: something we could do and make happen together. \u00a0So does that mean we need to do more workshops and \u00a0networking/outreach around the continent?\u00a0And what would the people we meet for whom connectivity is a problem plug into?\u00a0\u00a0It\u00a0was pointed out that in a context where Internet access\u00a0is an issue, we may need to give some extra thought to onboarding, outreach and engagement processes so as to lower the threshold for (South) Africa based to join the network we build:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>What could we together do to make this\u00a0way of collaborating and collective sense-making\u00a0more accessible to more people in South Africa?\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>What skills needed in order to be able to participate and how to help one another to\u00a0learn them?</li>\n\n<li>Who that is not in the room should\u00a0we \u00a0engage in this conversation and how could we go about doing that?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nIn one of the discussions it was pointed out that\u00a0there is\u00a0a link between the physical spaces, and in attempting to build a pan african p2p network\u00a0we may want to build a bridge between the messages we want to give, and putting them in the spaces. Someone mentioned a project that had happended in Ponti, pointing out this was not insignificant. Someone else mentioned that perhaps we need to find ways of\u00a0Learning how to read different spaces, e.g, townships.\n\n<h2>\n\n<a id=\"nextsteps\" name=\"nextsteps\"></a>Next steps\u00a0</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Gather feedback from participants (done)</li>\n\n<li>Produce proposal for moving forward</li>\n\n<li>Schedule project development\u00a0google hangouts\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-09-29 20:36:13", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:08.572594", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1339, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 12.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6484, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 1689, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Opening up discussion</b>\n\nMy comment is related to ways to classify employment: from policy papers and surveys reffered in the paper it would seem that part time or temporary jobs are forms of underemployment, and in large part are a result of young people's inability to find a full time job.\n\n<em>The European Labour Force Survey on 15-24 aged youth brings some data on reasons for part time and temporary work. Inability to find a full time job, followed by \u201cother\u201d reasons, taking part in education, own illness or disability, looking after children or incapacitated adults and other family or personal reasons, lead the list of reasons for engaging in part-time employment. Unlike the part-time employment, temporary employment is more often related to unreliable and uncertain job patterns that could deteriorate position of individuals participating in this sort of employment. High rate of temporary employment usually is related to the precarious jobs some social group makes a living from. In this respect, youth engaged in precarious (and temporary) employment lacks certainty and stability that could enable them to start or continue life independently from their parents. Harmfulness of the temporary contracts to the youth reflects in possibility that they get caught into alternation between temporary contracts and unemployment, damaging their status even beyond the age of thirties.</em>\n\nNow from policy end it seems quite clear there is a problem.. what happens when our message, Edgeryders, seems to be this?\n\n\"Our way to tackle this is twofold at least: \u00a01. taking up these small jobs, many times menial, only to do what matters for us.. until you come up with better offer, starting with education!\n\n2.Or the rest of us refuse employment per se, going for what we call non-employment, a life lived with minimum means, and only doing what we like, and if we have some sort of a job at one point it's because you also happen to call it a job! \u00a0For us it's just work that makes us happy\"..\n\nQuestion: where do these meet?

It's unavoidably personal and reflects negatively on my experience with LOTE5, which may cause people to draw out their swords in defence. Nevertheless, I believe it is a story worth telling for a few reasons. One, that there is a chance I may never get the opportunity (again) to tell my side of the narrative, which experience has told me is one of the crucial elements in retaining self-respect. Secondly, one of the themes of LOTE5 is failure, so in an ironic way, I'm contributing to this element in a very tangible way. \\#yolo\n\n<strong>TL;DR</strong>: I'm not doing a storytelling workshop anymore. LOTE5 is a social pyramid scheme.\n\nFirst, the chronology:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\tOn Januari 14th, I was asked over email by <a href=\"/u/noemi\">@Noemi</a>\u00a0to do a workshop on Storytelling on the last day of LOTE5.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tThis was flattering enough for me to reply the next day (15th) with a very rough outline of what I would do.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tOn the 17th, Nadia starts a chat on Facebook with essentially the same question, but subtly different. For some reason, an event is already made in the program, not mentioning me, but I think nothing of it. The chat continues for two days, with all kinds of vaguely related issues.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tOn the 19th, I send a full 2 page proposal to Noemi, outlining the workshop in detail. In the post script of the email I mention that I might be able to help out with the outreach, possibly in return for a LOTE5 ticket.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tOn the 21st, the workshop is given the OK over email, asking me to give a lot of attention to capturing material (text and video) as outcome of the workshop. (I'm not sure where, but I do agree to this.) Most of the remarks on both Facebook and email seem to be more like demands than anything else, but since I'm getting paid for this, I approach it mostly as a negotiation and reply with what is and isn't possible.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tAfter this, things get a bit confusing. Event pages have been setup on this website and Facebook, but I'm nowhere mentioned. I'm asked to write an outline on a <a href=\"/t/discovering-your-story-planning-narratives-of-care-workshop-at-lote5/5187\">wiki page</a>, which I do on the 25th. It's not clear what's supposed to happen then.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tThe wiki page suddenly attracts all sorts of feedback and response from the community. <a href=\"/u/natalia_skoczylas\">@Natalia_Skoczylas</a>\u00a0and I have a very confusing experience as she is under the impression that she'll be co-hosting, while I hadn't heard of that at all until that moment. (Natalia: I do not blame you at all for this, I hope that is clear.) My methodology is also called into question.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tWhen I push back on this, I get a (long) phone call from <a href=\"/u/nadia\">@Nadia</a>, which essentially comes down to the statement that \"this is how Edgeryders works\", namely that every project and/or idea is under the scrutiny of the community. Note that we'd already been going back-and-forth for 11 days with Nadia/Noemi/Kira at that point. I push back (over the phone) and basically say that I want to protect the creative integrity of the workshop, to which Nadia agrees.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tSomewhere in that chaos, I get asked by Nadia to translate text into Dutch and French. It's hard to say exactly what was supposed to be translated or who the target audience was, but it clearly has to do with outreach (getting people to come). I'm also asked to contact people I know in Belgium, connected to care projects. I more or less agree to this (verbally), with a deadline set for February 3rd. Now, the important bit here is that outreach was never part of my workshop proposal, so it basically is under the \"work for your ticket\" provision.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tAdmittedly, I drag my feet a bit on this outreach stuff. \u00a0There are many reasons for this (bad habits, other stuff going on, not sure if I could even make it to the rest of LOTE5, etc etc).</li>\n\n<li>\t\tMonday evening (1st of February), I get some short Facebook messages from Nadia (noone else is invited to the conversation this time, as with the phone call before). There is low registration on the workshop (3ppl), where she simply suggests to cancel it. I am a bit flabbergasted, but reply I think such a decision is basically up to her, not me. I do not get a response, which leaves me in limbo and very unmotivated to suddenly start translating stuff. Note that my workshop is still not mentioned properly anywhere at this point, the <a href=\"/t/storytelling-workshop-narratives-of-care-2016/5146\">event page</a> keeps saying what's been there all along.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tOn Thursday, the Facebook chat with Nadia opens again, basically stating she has no choice but to cancel the workshop. I'm not going to copy the entire conversation, as I can see how that can be used as an argument to censor me, but Nadia's most relevant message is this: \"The time is dragging out and seen from here it is neither feasible, nor particularly fun, to push if we do not see signs of commitment? \u00a0You had committed to doing outreach and recruitment to activist groups etc doing relevant work in Belgium. This was in the exchange for the ticket. The first step was to produce invitation materials in French and Dutch. You asked me to foillow up with you about this, I respected this commitment and wrote to you 3 days ago with no response. This leaves me at a loss for what to do. Suggestions?\"</li>\n\n<li>\t\tQuite an angry conversation ensues, as I'm quite let down with the whole experience. Nadia offers all the way at the end for me to \"do some video\", which I decline.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Reflections</h3>\n\nFirst off all, emotionally, this was a much rougher experience than I expected. Looking at possible explanations, I think the main thing is that registrations for LOTE5 just weren't running as well as certain people wished. Most of the talks I've looked at have quite low registration numbers, so it definitely wasn't just a problem with my workshop (which hadn't been communicated properly anyway). In a way, I understand the drive for last minute outreach, but I was never in a place where I had time to truly pick up responsibility to bridge that gap. (Note that giving a one day workshop is way lower in commitment than chasing people for weeks.)\n\nSecondly, there was an enormous confusion of communication channels, but also methodology. As the workshop was paid for, most of the feedback seemed to be quite hierarchical (customer-supplier style). However, about halfway through the process, it got mixed with community driven \"horizontallish\" feedback without the direct instructions becoming less in volume and intensity. Looking back, the worst moment were invariably the one-to-one contacts with Nadia, which felt like an angry customer on the line every time. To me, these two approaches (community feedback and direct management) are profoundly incompatible and feel enormously and needlessly stressful. I would also argue that from a project management perspective, community driven efforts should have way more time to sort themselves out. To this point it is still unclear who decides anything in Edgeryders, but from a practical point of view, it was Nadia that made the most crucial decisions by herself it seemed.\n\nThirdly, and I think this is very clear from Nadia's message during the cancelling of the workshop, outreach was hard-tied to both obtaining a ticket, but in the end also to the seemingly unrelated professional request for a (paid for) workshop. In a very literal sense, it meant that in order to come to LOTE5 myself and to earn a small amount of money (about 1/2 of my normal rate), I <em>had</em> to bring other people. I'm not sure how many people are being asked to do the same kind of outreach for LOTE5, but I believe that this essentially makes the whole conference a social pyramid scheme. You can't come unless you bring other people.\n\nFourthly, and this is my saddest realisation, my run-in with Nadia has the potential of closing the door between me and a lot of people I would have truly enjoyed seeing again at LOTE and later Edgeryders activities. It feels a lot like becoming an outcast, fitting I guess in the spirit of monasteries and the like. So, at least for me, this whole approach is damaging for relationships that are important to me. I'm not sure if it is a good thing that such a decision can lie in the hands of one single person. Realising this, I can only come to the conclusion that I would advise anyone to be incredibly careful in making commitments within Edgeryders, as the commitment does not seem to be with a community or even a company, but with a shadow owner. The top of the pyramid is closer than you think.\n\nThat's it. I'm assuming I've broken the netiquette rules enough to be swiftly removed. So be it.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-02-07 17:20:03", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:30.532400", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1678, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 30.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22080, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2317, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Is this still happening?</b>\n\nHuh, [K]... it seems writing has come to a halt. :-)\n\nMothering requires at least, I guess, a memorandum of understanding signed by one of the directors of Edgeryders LBG (like [AD_admin]) and someone to take responsibility as project managers.

We don\u2019t like the bureaucratic processes, high organisational requirements and over-specified funding calls - and we are sure that you don\u2019t like administering them either. The financial and social crisis is making reform and agile innovation even more important, but processes are still slow.</span>\n\n<span>We\u2019d like to find a better way to get support and resources to innovators who can make change happen, a way that\u2019s less bureaucratic but weeds out bad ideas by letting them fail quickly and cheaply. </span>\n\n<span>We know it\u2019s a bit self-interested, because most of the people who signed this letter are innovators themselves - we\u2019re writing it at the Edgecamp/Edgeryders unconference in Strasbourg#. But we think it\u2019s in your interests too, because you have complex social goals you want to meet, but you aren\u2019t working in ways that create complex solutions.</span>\n\n<span>So, we want to have a proper conversation with you about resourcing innovation differently, but here are some ideas to start with:</span>\n\n<span>Resource networks, not people</span>\n\n<span>None of the social problems that we face can be solved by single solutions, so we should start to focus on building up networks of ideas and initiatives (old and new). The sorts of successful innovation network we should emulate include: [ideas welcome here].</span>\n\n<span>Look for ideas that have already got community support</span>\n\n<span>We think crowdfunding has potential to be expanded. Crowdfunding demonstrates that an idea has community support before it even starts. We could work on a matched crowdfunding platform for innovation. Like the Unlimited programme in the UK, innovators could propose an idea and get pledges of cash or in-kind support from the community that it\u2019s intended to benefit, and then those contributions could be matched or increased by your resources.</span>\n\n<span>Give people time to think, not money to spend</span>\n\n<span>Lots of innovators have to take temporary work to fund their lives while they develop their ideas, but finding temporary work is time-consuming. Rather than providing cash for spending, funders could support people\u2019s living expenses for a certain period of time - like a bursary or a sabbatical from a university. This is already happening with one project in Strasbourg [detail?], and is also the logic behind the successful Ashoka.org programmes on \u201csocial entrepreneurship\u201d.</span>\n\n<span>Tell us what you need, and support us as you see solutions evolve</span>\n\n<span>Challenge-driven funding models can encourage the creation of solutions that actually work. Small grants could be given to a number of applicants to enable them to develop advanced prototypes, and following waves of funding would only be available for the most promising ones. This kind of \u2018create-then-fund\u2019 mechanism makes money follow results, not the opposite, crowding away the \u2018experts in proposal-writing\u2019 and attracting the innovative \u2018doers\u2019.</span>\n\n<span>Support places where innovation and connection can happen</span>\n\n<span>We\u2019d like to see funding for a network of simple, cheap spaces where innovation can happen, and then we\u2019ll put regular meetups and events in them. We don\u2019t mean shiny well-staffed co-working spaces, just a simple space with good wifi that can be used for regular events. Kultwerk West in Hamburg is a good example of the space we mean, and Third Thursday in Brighton the sort of event. If there were a Kultwerk in every big city, we\u2019d know where to make connections into local innovators </span>\n\n<span>We\u2019re also working on some things that we can do for ourselves, such as:</span>\n\n<span>Moneyless funding</span>\n\n<span>We don\u2019t (always) want your money. We\u2019re looking for ways to match resources across different ideas and projects, and bring in-kind support from communities that benefit from our innovations.

Prince Charming because he grew in one year as much as others do in seven \u2013 today, 360 volunteers from 5 cities carry, week by week, the beautiful and difficult task of encouraging children in foster care to \u201cGROW GREAT.\u201d Love-child because it was the result of an unfortunate conjuncture and yet a great desire to help children.\n\nIn short, [Ajungem MARI](https://www.facebook.com/ajungemmari?fref=ts) is the educational program through which institutionalised kids take part in interactive courses such as Romanian, Math, English, Music, Dancing, Theatre, Plastic Arts and Health Education; they get the chance to visit exhibitions, shows, movies or parks, to visit work places and discover what they would like as a future profession. They get the chance to go to personal development camps and to spend time with volunteers that become their role models and motivate them to \u201cgrow great.\u201d\n\n[b]A kick in the butt is a step forward. Or the resources you already have around you.[/b]\n\nWe came up with the name merely two hours after we got the project idea, on June 8, 2014 at the Femei pe Matasari street festival.\n\nFor two weeks, ever since I had handed my resignation, I had been working hard to launch an ample project dedicated to underprivileged kids, in collaboration with an association I believed in. It was a project meant to have a bigger impact than the one I used to coordinate for the other NGO that had hired me, where 200 volunteers were teaching English using interactive methods. I had left because even though I loved the project and the volunteers, I was feeling that these kids needed more than two hours per week.   \n\nThe enthusiasm of the launch turned abruptly into disappointment when, because of senseless egos, the organisers gave up on the project and disappeared from their own event. I was left confused alongside the volunteers who had followed me from one organisation to another, now thinking about how unfair the story had ended. \n\nThat evening was, in fact, the beginning. \u201cWhat do you mean we won\u2019t make the projects? We\u2019ll make them anyway!,\u201d the volunteers encouraged me. An old friend who came to help me and had promised me two financings told me that I still had her support if I managed to find a legal frame of action. A friend from high school assured me that I can run the projects through his association. Moreover, someone sitting at the table next to ours who was managing the third financing project that we had applied for heard our brainstorming and assured us that the financing would exist. Among these assurances fuelling our confidence in the program we came up with a name: Ajungem MARI (Growing Great). Three hours of work, three financing projects, a group of valuable volunteers and a promising launch at the Street Delivery festival coming up in event 4 days \u2013 more than enough time to come up with a site, a logo and a promotional strategy.\n\n![img](/uploads/default/original/2X/b/bb1fb66ab8adeccbabf9bff3f7b3ee398d0b84b3.jpg)\n\n[b]The essential resource: people[/b]\n\nThe work that we do requires empathy, patience and energy \u2013 ingredients that, no matter how big the budget, cannot be purchased. If there is anything like a recipe of success at Ajungem MARI, the key resource are people, by far.\n\nTo reach to 600 children in foster homes took a lot of work of coordination, communication and work. In the first months we concentrated our efforts to seal partnerships with Child Protection, starting projects and raising the first funds to ensure our projects. At the same time we developed the ability to coordinate the volunteers, whose number grew fast \u2013 from 70 people during the summer to 160 in autumn and 200 today, only in Bucharest. Next to them we count the 160 volunteers from other 4 cities around the country. High school kids, college students, employees \u2013 they all have in common the fact that they perform amazing things each week for institutionalized children.\n\n[b]Events, fundraising and building a community[/b]\n\nVisibility is important for the initiatives that are supported by the enthusiasm that drives people to become volunteers. This is the reason we often take part in events that bring people in the streets or\u2026 on the stage. We participated at education fairs, but also at many other festivals \u2013 InTransylvania, PadinaFest, BurgerFest, Femei pe Matasari and Street Delivery.\n\nFundraising is, besides the main financing source, an occasion to build a community of people of good will who support the cause in more ways than strictly financial. By meeting our team and seeing what we do, other people come to wish to help in any way they can \u2013 with ideas, recommendations, endorsement, advice, invitations and so on. \n\nIt is wonderful how, whenever we feel overwhelmed, there is always an impulse from the extraordinary community built around Ajungem MARI: somebody considers supporting the cause by running a marathon, organising a charitable dinner, donating the profits from photography, improvisation workshops or even stand-up comedy shows. Next week, for instance, an artist is donating us [henna tattoos](https://www.facebook.com/events/105893249752610/), some nice people race each other in a [kayak competition](https://www.facebook.com/events/107850582886734/) (the invitation is open, by the way), and next days we organise a charitable event with pancakes. :smile: \n![img](/uploads/default/original/2X/d/dfae8ada755d68cd2814fdf7460e30bee0871a17.jpg)\n\n[b]What\u2019s next: sustainable expansion[/b]\n\nThe program expands with the help of our local coordinators around the country, and in Bucharest we managed to consolidate a team full of dedicated volunteers. They coordinate by themselves two projects that work exceptionally without the help of the main team, caught with plenty of other tasks. In \u201cExplorer for a day,\u201d 10 people have organised over 40 activities outside the foster homes with the children since the beginning of the year. Recently we\u2019ve started the \u201cDare to dream!\u201d project which consists of professional orientation meetings for the children, together with mentors from various fields of activity.\n\nNew projects, new events and ideas appear every day at Ajungem MARI and I realise that we can do more of them, and better. During this year we have learned that there are extremely low chances for something that we have in mind to be truly impossible to achieve.\n\nIt is possible to manage it all: events, communication, partnerships and accounting papers, contracts and financing. You can learn everything by taking it one step at a time and by asking for help where you can\u2019t seem to find a way. Just don\u2019t start by thinking \u201cit can\u2019t be done.\u201d\n\n\n![img](/uploads/default/original/2X/5/54c13e6f0a8f8150d0ee59b20ad7b5f6fb683c63.jpg)\n[b]What we need: volunteers and specialists.[/b]\n\nI believe that each one of us can do something to support the children, even if one is inexperienced or hasn\u2019t thought about this until now. Children in foster homes believe that they are all alone in the world, abandoned in the State\u2019s care. They feel lonely and they see their future in very dark shades.\n\n[b]Our message is that every person can support them, especially by acceptance and showing them that they also matter. [/b]You don\u2019t have to be a specialist to know how to ask a kid what he likes to do, or to accompany him/her to a movie and then discuss a little what the main characters were doing. We wish for many others to join our program and to \u201cstick\u201d with the kids, become their friends and mentors. They can learn as they go how to work best with the youngest ones \u2013 the most important thing to do is to make themselves available.\n\n[b]We also need professionals in our team, especially psychologists and coaches, and people to help us organise and communicate better[/b], so that we will be able to involve more volunteers. We hope to build a team of volunteers that write, create graphic, present the project in future volunteers circles, organise events, even by only giving two hours a week for our cause. Also, it would be great if we managed to bring a team of volunteering psychologists that believe in the chance these kids have and want to help them develop \u2013 even through a small involvement, starting from two hours each week.\n\n[b]At the [workshop](/t/call-for-participation-futurespotters-bucharest-int-l-workshop-9-10-july/4517), I will put together various ideas about working with volunteers[/b], ambition and perseverance, but also about a network of dedicated people from the Ajungem MARI community that can support other initiatives. Also, I hope to find there other people that believe in what we do and are willing to offer a little of their time and abilities to raise our children.\n\nPhotos: Ajungem MARI\n\n\n----------\n\n##:ro:  _Romanian version_ <a name=\"ro\"></a>\n\nAjungem MARI e un F\u0103t-Frumos din flori.

Everything will still be built through the ER platform.</span>\n\n<span>TASK: AH will create the FB event and create a list of AH participants (locals mainly) that we will keep track of by guiding them through the process of starting completing tasks in the ER platform. <a href=\"/u/kiravde\">@KiraVde</a>\u00a0<a href=\"/u/ireinga\">@ireinga</a></span>\n\n<span>- <strong>Speakers and program: update from <a href=\"/u/noemi\"><span>@Noemi</span></a>\u00a0or <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RjWxk5_z4ddcOpurPhwH3uVv8FH0K_KRFs6M1e4UGF4/edit#gid=0\"><span>here</span></a>.\u00a0</strong></span>\n\n<span>Brussels speakers should have their preferred sessions on Friday, some non-Brussels speakers might fly in too late on Friday to host a session.</span>\n\n<span>TASK: AH team will push to finalize some of the sessions they mobilized their community for. <a href=\"/u/manuelpueyo\">@Manuelpueyo</a>\u00a0<a href=\"/u/anton_sabbe\">@Anton_Sabbe</a>\u00a0Lotte Sarah Marek C\u00e9line</span>\n\n<span>- <strong>Venue: creative industries track program/sessions and call to action for SMart.</strong></span>\n\n<span>Not discussed</span>\n\n<strong><span>- Venue: technical requirements to send out to SMart.</span></strong>\n\n<span>TASK: </span><a href=\"/u/ireinga\" style=\"font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 19.2px; line-height: 43.52px;\">@ireinga</a><span> will create a file with a list of material needed with <a href=\"/u/noemi\">@Noemi</a>'s help.</span>\n\n<strong><span>- Fundraising updates</span></strong>\n\n<span>Irene\u2019s contact is sending out the proposals tonight.\u00a0</span>\n\n<strong><span>- <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Lw_CCvNM-mucc0yUUv2BSy_VppAwealShRVye1dFmiU/edit\"><span>Participant list</span></a> updates</span></strong>\n\n<span>Tasks are really important in order to push people to contribute.

En g\u00e9n\u00e9ral</b>\n\nBonjour Lyne,\n\nTout protocole d'observation n'est que l'outil que l'on met en place dans un dispositif d'observation. Je dirai l'un des outils car il peut exister des protocles diff\u00e9rents et mutuellement s'excluant et d'autres outils.\n\nLe dispositif d'observation est construit \u00e0 partir d'hypoth\u00e8ses quant \u00e0 ce qui pourrait \u00eatre observ\u00e9, quant \u00e0 ce qui fait que ce que nous voulons observer n'existe pas, quant au type d'outils utilisables et ceux qui ne le sont pas. Le dispositif indique aussi le niveau auquel on observera et, s'il en existe plusieurs, les raisons de leur pluralit\u00e9 et la mani\u00e8re dont ces niveaux d'observation sont articul\u00e9s les uns aux autres. Le dispositif indique aussi le lieu de l'observation.\n\nCe que je veux observer se trouve l\u00e0, dans ce \"grain\" particulier. Il devrait se manifester de telle et telle fa\u00e7on et si je ne constate pas ces manifestations alors soit je me suis tromp\u00e9 dans mes hypoth\u00e8ses de localisation, soit je me suis tromp\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de ce que je veux observer.\n\nTout dispositif d'observation fiable fait bien entendu aussi quelques hypoth\u00e8ses \u00e0 propos des raisons pour lesquelles ce que l'on veut observer n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9j\u00e0 observ\u00e9.\u00a0\n\nEnfin, le cr\u00e9ateur du dispositif d'observation doit indiquer les bonnes raisons qui l'incitent \u00e0 vouloir observer l'existence de tel ou tel \u00e9tat du Monde, soit qu'il y ait des faits, soit qu'il y ait des lacunes dans des syst\u00e8mes explicatifs.\u00a0\n\nTout cela doit \u00eatre tr\u00e8s coh\u00e9rent et justifi\u00e9. Bien s\u00fbr il est n\u00e9cessaire de produire des explications quant \u00e0 ce que l'on veut observer et dire pour quelles raisons elles ne sont pas satisfaisantes.\n\nOr, ces raisons ne peuvent \u00eatre id\u00e9ologiques. Elles doivent d'abord \u00eatre dans le m\u00eame langage que celui dans lequel les explications insatisfaisantes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produites. Un doute \u00e0 propos d'une explication neurologique ne peut \u00eatre produit que dans les termes de la neurologie.\n\nEnfin, enfin et ce n'est peut-\u00eatre pas fini; il faut expurger le dispositif d'observation et les diff\u00e9rents outils et protocoles utilis\u00e9s de tous leurs fant\u00f4mes, de tous leurs diables cach\u00e9s. En effet, lorsque nous ne faisons pas attention, tout cela produit les signaux que nous recherchons tout simplement parce qu'ils le font automatiquement. A ce moment l\u00e0 nous n'avons qu'un protocole trivial, des outils triviaux, un dispositif d'observation qui n'existe pas.\n\nJe rajouterai aussi qu'il n'est pas rigoureux de m\u00e9langer des vocabulaires cr\u00e9\u00e9s en des \u00e9poques diff\u00e9rentes sans savoir exactement ce que les mots d\u00e9signent, comment ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produits et sur quelles bases, exp\u00e9riences, mod\u00e8les de l'Univers ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9s.\n\nOpposer une science occidentale \u00e0 une science orientale n'a pas de sens, du point de vue des connaissances, du point de vue de la compr\u00e9hension de ce qui les a produites, des voies de production, de leur efficacit\u00e9.\n\nSupposer que la science occidentale n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 dynamique, int\u00e9ress\u00e9e par la partie \u00e9nerg\u00e9tique du R\u00e9el, c'est la m\u00e9conna\u00eetre profond\u00e9ment. Il y a l\u00e0 une confusion entre les voies exp\u00e9riencielles retenues \u00e0 un moment et des choix id\u00e9ologiques qui sont ce qui sont pour chaque chercheur.\n\nA partir du XVIII \u00e8me si\u00e8cle il est apparu en Occident que nous arriverions mieux \u00e0 comprendre le R\u00e9el en en isolant de petits bouts qu'en essayant de le saisir globalement. Les outils ont d'abord su saisir des morceaux fig\u00e9s ou morts avant d'\u00eatre capable de saisir des morceaux dynamiques, en vie.\n\nToutes ces saisies lorsqu'elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9ussies ont modifi\u00e9s les compr\u00e9hensions du R\u00e9el et ont fait \u00e9merger des localit\u00e9s plut\u00f4t que des erreurs d'interpr\u00e9tation. L\u00e0, \u00e0 tel niveau, le R\u00e9el peut \u00eatre d\u00e9crit ainsi et nous pouvons avec les observations r\u00e9colt\u00e9es sous forme de th\u00e9orie produire des objets, des outils qui vont fonctionner \u00e0 ce niveau l\u00e0. Au-del\u00e0 \u00e7a ne marche pas.\n\nLes sciences ont toujours cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9tendre leurs explications le plus loin possible jusqu'\u00e0 leur limite d'efficacit\u00e9. La philosophie moderne, celle de Fran\u00e7ois Laruelle, d'Anne-Fran\u00e7oise Shcmid, la mienne, ont la m\u00eame exigence.\n\nQue les sciences modernes en arrive \u00e0 rencontrer des th\u00e9orisations produites ailleurs, dans d'autres \u00e9poques pr\u00eache en faveur d'une certaine unit\u00e9 de l'exp\u00e9rience humaine et de ses modes explicatifs. Ce qui ne veut pas dire que deux explications identiques en mots le sont du point de vue du R\u00e9el connu.\n\nDonc, il est douteux de dire que les principes d'incertitude d\u00e9couverts par Einstein ou les th\u00e9oriciens de la physique quantique sont identiques \u00e0 ceux d\u00e9crits dans des philosophies hindoues. Les \u00e9nonc\u00e9s ne proviennent pas du m\u00eame niveau d'observation.\n\nLe principe d'inflation de l'Univers n'exige aucune force autre que celle dite du Big-bang. Il n'a pas besoin d'une hypoth\u00e8se merveilleuse suppl\u00e9mentaire. De nombreuses observations suffisamment certaines justifient fortement l'existence de l'hypoth\u00e8se du Big-Bang. Mais peut-\u00eatre \u00e9mergeront d'autres explications plus satisfaisantes capables de rendre compte de plus d'observations que l'hypoth\u00e8se actuelle.\n\nL'int\u00e9r\u00eat m\u00e9thodologique des sciences dites \"\u00e0 l'occidentale\" est que ces sciences tentent rarement d'int\u00e9grer d'un seul coup, en une seule th\u00e9orie, en un seul mod\u00e8le, des observations diff\u00e9rentes r\u00e9alis\u00e9es dans une m\u00eame localit\u00e9.\n\nCes sciences dites \"\u00e0 l'occidentale\" affirme aussi qu'une m\u00eame localit\u00e9 peut \u00eatre l'objet de diff\u00e9rentes \"th\u00e9ories\" c'est-\u00e0-dire de diff\u00e9rents mod\u00e8les s\u00e9par\u00e9s ou s'intersectant permettant de rendre compte de tous ces aspects.\n\nEst-ce parce que le R\u00e9el est discontinu ou parce que les humains ne peuvent pas atteindre ce R\u00e9el d'une mani\u00e8re globale, le d\u00e9bat reste ouvert mais il n'a pas de r\u00e9ponse. Disons que c'est un moment dans notre connaissance du R\u00e9el.\n\nCe que j'ai propos\u00e9 dans mon Jeu de l'Homme Lyne, est un moyen tr\u00e8s simple de tester des affirmations quant \u00e0 la nature humaine. Ce que l'on dit exister chez un Homme doit pouvoir devenir une comp\u00e9tence permettant de cr\u00e9er des ressources et des connaissances permettant \u00e0 cet Homme d'eixister. Lorsque je dis \"doit\" cela signifie qu'il suffit d'agir de mani\u00e8re pr\u00e9cise et sans utiliser des comp\u00e9tences prises dans un autre mod\u00e8le.\n\nTon mod\u00e8le est \"l'Homme lumineux\", tu dois agir Lyne avec les comp\u00e9tences que tu d\u00e9cris pour cet \"Homme\", \u00e0 l'exclusion de tout autre. Tu es ton propre terrain d'observation. Et il ne doit pas exister d'autres explications. Si il en existe une, plus certaine, plus ancr\u00e9e dans le soma, alors ton explication, ton hypoth\u00e8se n'est pas bonne. Tu dois en changer. C'est ainsi que se construisent les connaissances certaines, celles qui sont des ressources pour l'humanit\u00e9.\n\nJe rajouterai que ton hypoth\u00e8se de \"conscience cosmique\" est une version du principe anthropomorphique selon lequel l'Univers est fait pour l'Homme second\u00e9e par le principe de design intelligent.\n\nQue des \"lois\" communes r\u00e9gissent le d\u00e9veloppement d'entit\u00e9s s\u00e9par\u00e9es signifie l'homog\u00e9n\u00e9it\u00e9 du R\u00e9el dans notre Univers et rien d'autre. Que nous soyons seuls dans l'Univers nous place comme \u00e9tat particulier du R\u00e9el mais ne dit rien de plus. Quant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont l'humain peut continuer \u00e0 se d\u00e9velopper ne pas voir que \"l'intellect\" est \u00e0 la fois la manifestation de l'organisme humain, traduction de ses exp\u00e9riences dans des objets apparemment \"immat\u00e9riels\", c'est faire une erreur m\u00e9thodologique.\n\nJe finirai sur une derni\u00e8re remarque quant \u00e0 l'appr\u00e9hension du R\u00e9el. Si le monde ph\u00e9nom\u00e9nal n'est que projection de la conscience ou de notre conscience, alors le protocole que tu veux utiliser n'a aucun sens. Si il existe une conscience g\u00e9n\u00e9rale dont nous sommes simplement les projecteurs et les projections alors, il va falloir que tu expliques comment projecteurs et projections peuvent tester l'existence de leur source.\n\nCela revient \u00e0 tester l'existence de Dieu pour les Chr\u00e9tiens ou les Musulmans. Ces derniers ont \u00e9dict\u00e9 que ce test est un p\u00e9ch\u00e9. Les premiers ont affirm\u00e9 que ce test est la meilleure voie pour d\u00e9couvrir par tout la manifestation de Dieu. Ceci a conduit aux sciences occidentales.\n\nRemplacer \"Dieu\" par \"conscience cosmique\" n'a que fort peu de sens puisque c'est la recherche de ce Dieu qui a renforc\u00e9 l'hypoth\u00e8se mat\u00e9rialiste, physique du R\u00e9el.\u00a0\n\nTu as du boulot \u00e0 faire et il convient toujours d'oeuvrer \"petit\" pour d\u00e9montrer l'existence de ce que l'on croit.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-20 12:15:14", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:59.038077", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1496, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [9313], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5394, "user_id": 2464, "topic_id": 5361, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 20pt; margin-bottom: 6pt;\"><span><span>EdgeSense_II_mockup (variation </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1hfGARw2hQRwKs8ElIaPS7VcFLgqbxR1IHK2kE9sead4/edit?usp=sharing\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><span>1</span></a><span> </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1bCZKBs10s3iTEN8M5B6GeD6HhHQeBPPXih0bf5Fvo94/edit?usp=sharing\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><span>2</span></a><span> and </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1WfA0UrwgTfBoxnmj1uZFDJvTNAIitIz76bRqYuF-dFs/edit?usp=sharing\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><span>3</span></a><span>)</span></span></h2>\n\n<span>The mock-up should serve as a reference target app to express requirements, and more importantly:</span>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\t<span>specify user (community manager, ER conversationalist, ...) tasks</span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span>specify appropriate visual encodings -- those suggested in the mock-ups are just mock-ups, not even suggestion (although based on past experience)</span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span>specify proper interaction</span>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<span>VISUALIZATION INCLUDED IN THE MOCK-UPS ARE JUST SUGGESTIONS</span>\n\n<span>What we are after is to </span><span>collect ideas</span><span> on what representations would be best to support specific tasks.

Je n'ai pas tellement r\u00e9fl\u00e9chi \u00e0 comment tout cela pourrait s'embo\u00eeter. Je croyais jusqu'\u00e0 maintenant qu'il y avait une myriade de gens qui se penchent sur ces questions, et qu'ils avaient r\u00e9volutionn\u00e9 la science. Je croyais aussi que n'\u00e9tant qu'une Lyne ordinaire, je ne serais pas appel\u00e9e \u00e0 contribuer. Force est de constater qu'il n'y a peut-\u00eatre pas tant de r\u00e9centes r\u00e9f\u00e9rences r\u00e9volutionnaires que cela, qui sont disponibles, et qu'il y aurait\u00a0 peut-\u00eatre lieu d'en cr\u00e9er quelques-unes. Mais surtout, il est probable que peu de travaux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9s en lien avec les gouvernements (par exemple, comment les gouvernements pourraient g\u00e9rer consciemment ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments, quels types de projets exp\u00e9rimentaux ils pourraient tenter de mettre sur pied).\n\nApr\u00e8s la lecture du livre de Gobi Krishna, j'ai effectu\u00e9 quelques h\u00e2tives recherches. Je suis entr\u00e9e en contact avec un professeur qui vit en Californie. Je lui ai demand\u00e9 s'il connaissait des associations, s'il pouvait m'aider \u00e0 identifier des gens dans mon pays. Les r\u00e9ponses n'\u00e9taient pas concluantes. J'ai effectu\u00e9 des recheches concernant Deepak Chopra. Il est clair qu'il est lui aussi dans un \u00e9tat physique de conscience, \u00e0 un stade tr\u00e8s avanc\u00e9. Cependant, il en parle un peu, de fa\u00e7on peu compr\u00e9hensive pour le commun des mortels (mon humble avis).\n\n\u00c0 un moment donn\u00e9, je me suis un peu d\u00e9courag\u00e9e, r\u00e9alisant que G. Krishna n'avait pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 trouver de guide et que les doutes l'avaient assailli pendant la majorit\u00e9 de son existence. Je me suis vu revivre la m\u00eame histoire, et cette perspective m'a affol\u00e9e. J'ai constat\u00e9 que mes r\u00e9f\u00e9rences habituelles effleuraient \u00e0 peine le sujet et en parlaient en usant de paraboles. Tournant en rond, j'ai mis ces recherches de c\u00f4t\u00e9. Sauf que l'intention est demeur\u00e9e vive dans mon esprit.\n\nLorsque le projet Edgeryders a pris naissance, j'ai pris mon courage \u00e0 deux mains, et j'ai int\u00e9gr\u00e9 cela \u00e0 mon histoire. Ils voulaient des gens qui se tiennent 'on the edge'? Alors, c'est une fa\u00e7on de l'\u00eatre, me suis-je dit.\n\nVoil\u00e0 o\u00f9 j'en suis maintenant.\n\nUn peu plus t\u00f4t aujourd'hui, j'ai eu une conversation avec Alberto Cottica, au sujet de ce rapport de mission.\n\nMalheureusement, Alberto ne comprend pas vraiment ce qui se dit dans ce fil de discussion - cela d\u00e9passe largement ses capacit\u00e9s de compr\u00e9hension du fran\u00e7ais. Puisqu'il est le gestionnaire principal du projet, je trouve cela probl\u00e9matique. Alors j'ai eu l'id\u00e9e --- un flash qui m'est pass\u00e9 par la t\u00eate --- de lui expliquer par l'exemple des X-Men. Tout le monde connait ces films, avec Patrick Stewart jouant le r\u00f4le d'un professeur de mutants. Si on enl\u00e8ve les lames de m\u00e9tal qui sortent du bout des doigts et autres effets sp\u00e9ciaux plut\u00f4t spectaculaires, l'histoire a des points en commun avec la n\u00f4tre!\n\nJe m'entrevois davantage dans le r\u00f4le de l'\u00e9l\u00e8ve, parce que je suis plong\u00e9e dans une exp\u00e9rience que je ne comprends pas moi-m\u00eame. Cela doit exister, des \u00e9coles de Kundalini (yoga et autres disciplines). Sauf que ce n'est pas par ces voies, \u00e0 mon avis, que des autorit\u00e9s gouvernementales s'int\u00e9ressont \u00e0 ces questions. Elles risqueraient de ne pas prendre les travaux au s\u00e9rieux, de ne pas arriver \u00e0 faire de lien entre la situation actuelle et les applications possibles de ces recherches.\n\nLes ex\u00e9cutifs de Edgeryders, il faudrait vraiment s'assurer qu'ils comprennent le d\u00e9veloppement de cette discussion, et en saisissent toute la port\u00e9e. Il y a des barri\u00e8res de langues \u00e0 franchir. Mais pas seulement cela. Une vulgarisation et simplification des id\u00e9es sera n\u00e9cessaire, notamment \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape du rapport final, pour transmettre des recommandations compr\u00e9hensibles aux d\u00e9cideurs et gestionnaires gouvernementaux.\n\nTout comme un philosophe (Bernard <span>Stiegler</span>) <a href=\"http://www.rslnmag.fr/post/2011/03/15/Bernard-Stiegler-lopen-data-est-171;-un-evenement-dune-ampleur-comparable-a-lapparition-de-lalphabet-187;.aspx\">a ouvert le bal des discussions</a> d'une conf\u00e9rence sur l'open data (organis\u00e9e par Microsoft France il y a un an), j'entrevois que les pr\u00e9sentes discussions pourraient situer la mission Edgeryders dans son ensemble, et non pas s'appliquer qu'aux cas d'\u00e9veil.\n\nEt qui sait? Cela pourrait conduire \u00e9ventuellement \u00e0 un projet exp\u00e9rimental, un peu dans le genre des X-Men. Pourquoi pas?!!!\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://snarkerati.com/movie-news/files/2010/09/patric-stewart-professor-x.jpg\" style=\"width: 490px; height: 327px;\">\n\n<em>I repeat here a discussion I had with Alberto Cottica (see this status </em><a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/statuses/713\">http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/statuses/713</a>).\n\nFor 2 years, I had a pressing need to understand my situation. I looked for references. Beyond 1967, there seems to be a void. A 1967 book, by Gopi Krishna, is a succession of questions - so many questions, few answers: for these things have been kept as secret as the contents of a sealed envelope.\n\nAs the distance between the earth and the moon, and between the earth and the sun was estimated by Aristarque de Samos, more than 2500 years ago, even before sciences made more accurate calculations, a contemporary experimental philosopher seeks to demonstrate that philosophy is nowadays useful, it is the Mother of sciences, and it can be as reliable as other sciences, when these sciences do not know how to go about studying the \"vital energy\".\n\nSo far, we found Gabrielle (@leavinci). She lives in Italy. I would like to identify other people in this state of awakening, and ask them to join the group. Within the next few months, I am hoping that our research and discussions will lead us to many other cases, and possibly other scholars working on these issues.\n\nI saw the image of the X-Men movies emerge in my head today --- Patrick Stewart playing the role of a teacher of a special school for gifted mutants --- to show you the parallel between this story and the present situation.\n\nIn the world of X-Men, genetic mutations have become commonplace, granting powers to a growing population. In X-Men, these qualities are revealed usually in adolescence, a critical time during which a mutant can sink into doubt and error or on the contrary may happen to master his/her talents and become an enlightened individual. (In the real, these qualities are revealed at any age, usually take decades to develop. However, there are signs throughout life.)\n\nIn order to help them through these difficult times, the Professor Charles Xavier created a special school, where he trains mutants to use their powers and to accept themselves. He also teaches them to live in harmony with 'normal' human beings. (Filippi's role so far has been about exploration and\u00a0 self-acceptance. He asks a lot of questions about teaching, \u201c<em>p\u00e9dagogie</em>\u201d.)\n\nThe X-Men story tackles the problem of the relation between Man and its development, and the integration of differences. (Which is something similar to Edgeryders\u2019s mission.) Professor Charles Xavier's entourage believes in the advantage of the difference, and in benefits of mixing capabilities.\n\nBut in this story, the government seeks to exterminate mutants. I hope that this does not happen in the real\u2026\n\nThe contribution of Filippi and the philosophers community can help Edgeryders participants in many ways, not just for the cases of awakening (ie the mutants).\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-15 06:29:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:39.292756", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1326, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 15.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7955, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 464, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>OpenCare as a Wikipedia-type system</b>\n\nVery interesting, @Ezio_Manzini! Here's the money quote:\u00a0\n\nIn principle, everybody can care for someone else [...]\u00a0in different forms [...], but all of them require attention. Given that attention is a limited resource [...] care [...]\u00a0is [also]\u00a0a diffuse but limited resource.\u00a0\n\nThis vision of care activities reminds me of Wikipedia. Wikipedia is quite a coherent object. It's also very decentralized\u00a0in scope and\u00a0authorship; and tasks are allocated across contributors by self-selection, without central control.\n\nContributors are extremely diverse in their interests, experience, and in the time they contribute to Wikipedia. Some Wikipedians, like me, might fix a typos or repair a broken link here or there, and only very occasionally enter a factual information. Others take full stewardship for entries\u00a0that are important to them. Others, still, make tens of edits a day. A lot of Wikipedia's advantage comes from the fact that it can use effectively\u00a0<em>small</em>\u00a0contributions.\u00a0\n\nOpen care might be the same. A mature open care ecosystem, I propose, is one where the natural human impulse to care and help can be easily translated into a contribution. One, in other words, where, if you can only contribute 30 minutes, you can, and your contribution will make a small, but tangible difference.

This program funds research on how online platforms can be used to elicit collectively intelligent responses. Putting a project on a website does not qualify as collective intelligence: in the proposal, we have argued that online conversation\u00a0<em>around</em>\u00a0a project does. That is what we promised to do. Of course, discussion does not always catch on: that's well understood. But on the whole, we should have enough conversation to be able to argue that ours is a really collective process.\n\nI think that is defensible: we have 323 posts and 1,423 comments authored by 201 people, so an average of over\u00a0four comments per post. 13 threads have 20 comments or more, two of them started by Berlin students. This translates into a social network with 201 nodes and 766 edges.

(Plenty still exists and thrives today: plenty.org). \u00a0Because we had to provide emergency health care to ourselves (the Farm had more than 1000 people at the time) and because some of those educated people wanted to apply themselves toward meaningful work that was also interesting, we had an unusually large group of EMTs, paramedics, nurses and other health care workers.\n\nSeeing how bad things were up in the south Bronx, we decided to go up there and see for ourselves if we could lend a hand.\n\nFast forward to early 1978. \u00a0A group of us located a suitable building and squatted in it, fixing it into a livable place. I was part of that early group.(That included converting the coal-buring furnace to a giant woodstove that we fueled by finding leftover wood products in nearby abandoned factories. \u00a0I went on may of those firewood runs. \u00a0Unforgettable!)\u00a0My daughter was born in that building, home delivered by one of our Farm midwives.\n\nLater that year, Plenty began a free ambulance service to the nearby residents. Soon enough some grant money was procured, equipment bought and\u00a0the ambulance service kicked into high gear, saving many lives. \u00a0The service lasted for six years, until crack and automatic weapons made the place much more dangerous than it already was. \u00a0But the good news was that the service had by then embarrassed the city so much by doing what the government was not doing, that the city improved its service to that community.\n\nRelevant to this topic: nobody asked for permission to do this. \u00a0No permits were applied for or obtained until much later when a lot of publicity was generated, and\u00a0the city couldn't exactly turn it down.\n\nI personally was a small player in this particular saga, and there is much more to the story - it was an incredible experience. \u00a0But I remain in awe today at the vision, the guts and the perseverance of the main people driving the project. \u00a0 It was the spirit of OpenCare at its finest.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-23 15:37:46", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:53.751037", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 544, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 22.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [6570], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26084, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 3008, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Really interesting!</b>\n\nI really enjoyed your talk.

The good news is that we talked about this at today's community call, so I do have something to contribute.\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>Yes, it is difficult to understand and clearly communicate the unMonastery</strong>. This is intended: building an institution takes trial, error and emergence \u2013 hence time. But yes, it does put the project in chicken-and-egg dilemma: it needs committed people to emerge, but people need for it to have emerged before they can commit. Long ago we decided to attack this by doing a small-scale prototype, that would break the dilemma. Now people can say \"I can participate by doing X, and I can expect Y to happen from my participation\". What X and Y are depends on who you are, but the call provides a clear and certain framework.</li>\n\n<li><strong>It turns out this choice was correct</strong>. The conversation shifted from abstract to concrete: from \"institution design\" to fitting wheels to furniture, and from \"relationships with the local community\" to debating actual problems pointed out by actual Materans. When this happens, you know you are onto something.</li>\n\n<li>Also, <strong>we aligned the interests of Edgeryders and the unMonastery</strong> by recasting \\#LOTE3 as a bridge event from the workshops in spring 2013 to the unMonastery going live in February 2014. Again, very good move; now the relationships with the local community are discussed in terms of cooking together and Materans offering their homes to us. Also, \\#LOTE3 will create more buzz around the unMonastery, given that there is good content and a social media team already on the case. </li>\n\n</ol>\n\nSo, I would argue, we do have a strategy, and a good one at that. We don't need so much more design at the project level: we need execution (and design at the building/rituals/hosted projects level). Specifically:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>applicants need to be handheld</strong>. From today's community call, I got the impression that first-round applicants like [TOOLosophy], [Jessy Jetpacks] and [invisigot] were still waiting to hear about their application. If this is true, the situation needs to be corrected, and they need to be steered towards the actual call, and they have a right to be counseled if they so desire. This is clearly Ben's responsibility.</li>\n\n<li><strong>more applicants need to be found</strong>. This needs help from everybody. Today<a href=\"http://www.chefuturo.it/2013/08/la-mappa-degli-immobili-comunali-inutilizzati-le-residenze-di-unmonastery-il-database-degli-hotspot-wi-fi-tre-punti-per-gli-smart-citizens/\"> I went live again</a> on my main media outlet; Wired Italia covered us just two weeks ago. There is more to come. Who else has ideas for getting the word out to interesting people that might apply? It might be as simple as telling an interesting friend \u2013 actually this might be worth more than an article on Wired. </li>\n\n<li><strong>we need action on the unMonastery \\#LOTE track</strong>. I think that track has potential to be the cooler of the three, and just making it together will be a powerful campaign for getting unMonasterians to sign up. <strong>My proposal on this is to create a team</strong>. At today's community call, [Noemi] said that the three people mentioned above (Andrei/TOOLosophy, Jessica and Fabio/Invisigot) would be probably happy to step in given clear permission to do so. We could build a team with these people plus Ben plus me, with our own weekly community call (it seems to be going well) or even, initially, just participating in the \"normal\" Friday morning call to increase mutual awareness. I have done some preliminary work on possible sessions and am eager to share it with you. I would also make it explicit that you can be an unMonastery resident without participating in building the LOTE3 unMon track and viceversa.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nWhat do you guys think?", "created_at": "2013-08-16 21:58:49", "updated_at": "2019-06-22 16:21:01.780330", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 676, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [24774], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8574, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 5694, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Done.</b>\n\n@LuceChiodelliUB check if this works for you?\n\nEditable document <a href=\"%E2%80%8Bhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1vnzvbnVRfR90FHOqThm7aDX0U7SEV6fwL3JdujvVK14/edit#\">here.</a>\n\n", "created_at": "2016-06-28 09:52:58", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:49.497100", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 27, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32208, "user_id": 665, "topic_id": 1712, "post_number": 54, "raw": "<b>Thanks</b>\n\nThat change made, thanks for sharing it.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-09-27 07:23:13", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:57.002390", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 13, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [13877], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 15391, "user_id": 3045, "topic_id": 6243, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>interesting work ....</b>\n\nThis seems to be a very interesting work!

Most of it tends to focus on \"business models\". For many,\u00a0the most difficult part of all this is actually\u00a0making\u00a0a\u00a0sale and generating\u00a0revenue. When you are offering something new or trying to do things in new ways, generating sales is a complex challenge. Especialy if you are dealing with with immaterial value.\n\nSo how does this work? Or rather, how can we learn to do this together here?\u00a0\n\nI guess part of it comes down to\u00a0being in the game long enough so that when prospective customers research you, you have had time to leave enough positive traces about you online and in personal relationships so it's clear you really exist, are cool, and do good work. Let's call this building presence and social capital. I'm guessing that in part it's a numbers game where you need to reach very very many different people, and make it easy for them to understand what you have to offer and give them a choice of ways in which they can make use of, and pay\u00a0for it. Let's call this driving sales.\u00a0Politics and policy, social norms and expectations\u00a0around <a href=\"/t/innovation-and-work/1012\">work, meaning and value</a> of course play into this, but they deservere a separate discussion so I am not going to get into them here.\n\nThis stuff is hard, resource-intensive, takes a lot of experimentation and learning from experience. But if we crack it, it opens a completely different range of possibilities for getting important initiatives off the ground and keeping them there. Not just for ourselves and this community but for so many others struggling to keep afloat while doing meaningful work. And there is so much space for getting creative and breaking new ground here together. Which I think makes it a great challenge to take on together.\n\n<span>There are many things we can do as members of a large and growing international community of individuals with a diverse range of skills and interests from cryptography to urban farming. Things which are more difficult to achieve as individuals trying to act alone. One of them is building new ways to making a living in a networked society. So how could we use the fact that Edgeryders is now a registered organisation to generate paid work opportunities for ourselves and one another? \u00a0There is really only one way to figure this out. By trying, learning and getting better at it together! Let's call this a p2p course on making a living on the edge in which every participant is both a learner and a teacher. And\u00a0use <strong>#maledge\u00a0</strong>to coordinate our efforts.</span>\n\nThe ideal would be\u00a0to mix theory with practice, in meeting real challengers together. I suggest we do a weekly google hangout, every weekend on\u00a0<strong><a href=\"http://goo.gl/JuNFc\">Edgeryders always-open community call channel</a>\u00a0</strong>between now and \\#LOTE3 (pick<a href=\"http://doodle.com/i9276x2yp7kayi34\">\u00a0a time that works for you</a>).\u00a0 During the call we take\u00a0on one of the challenges in the list below\u00a0and invite people to it who can share their experiences or give relevant advice. We end the call with a specific goal to be achieved together by the next week. Some suggested challenges we could take on,\u00a0feel free to add your own:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Challenge \\#1: Surfacing the prospective customers</li>\n\n<li>Challenge \\#2: Building and managing a sales oriented relationships effectively</li>\n\n<li>Challenge \\#3: Creating relevant contexts that you're geniunely excited about</li>\n\n<li>Challenge \\#4: Presenting options to choose from for working together\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Challenge \\#5: Getting word of what you have to offer out to\u00a0many people</li>\n\n<li>Challenge \\#5: Learning to get better and teaching others</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Where does all of this go?\u00a0</strong>By the end of the process we will end up knowing more about how to do make a living in a networked society. Depending on the interest of the participants, we could build a\u00a0session at \\#LOTE3 in\u00a0which we, together, tweak the Edgeryders platform and communication according to the results of this process to make it better suited to generating revenue for community members work. And summarise our learning into this <strong><a href=\"/t/the-edgeryders-guide-to/327\">how-to wiki</a></strong>\u00a0to share with members of our respective communities to help make ourselves more resilient together.\n\n<span><em>The more we know about one another, the more effective we're going to be in supporting one another's learning journey.</em>\u00a0</span><em>Sign up by leaving a comment below introducing yourself, and what skills you personally want to develop by engaging in this process</em>.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-09-06 16:56:36", "updated_at": "2017-10-03 10:30:55.483146", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 928, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 82], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32458, "user_id": 1590, "topic_id": 2204, "post_number": 20, "raw": "<b>Following online</b>\n\nSame question with Nadia.

Pelion in Central Greece, two friends have decided to create Village Psy. Our project aims to foster the exchange of knowledge and ideas through an open dialogue and spontaneous experiential expression which gives space for personal development. The main objective of Village Psy is to bring together people who have a common interest in issues related to psychotherapy, personal development, and self-improvement. The whole process goes beyond the format of conferences and seminars in enclosed spaces but integrates elements of the natural environment.\n\nThere are numerous examples from similar healing events in ancient Greece, such as the Asclepeia showing the importance of nature in healing. Drawing from this inspiration, Village Psy combines experiential workshops, presentations, and parallel events to visitors who are looking to combine their summer holidays with self-development.\n\n<strong>The people behind the idea</strong>\n\nVillage Psy is an original idea of Dimitris Pantelis and Atalandi Apergi. The initial idea came 3 years ago, in a discussion under an old plane tree in the village of Pinakates. The discussion revolved around how psychotherapy connects with nature, and how this connection could be expanded to benefit more people. This idea has since evolved to a vision which connects two pillars: 1) thematic tourism and 2) making the process sustainable, repeatable and stable over time.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAtalandi has a degree in Sociology and is a post-graduate in Text &amp; Performance Studies. She has also completed a 4-year specialized post-graduate training diploma in drama therapy, and further enriched her psychotherapeutic training and experience with seminars in various psychiatric structures. As a drama therapist, she has clinical experience with different populations, including drug addicts, immigrants, abused women, psychiatric patients, the elderly and people with learning disabilities. Atalandi is a member of the European Association of Psychotherapy (EAP), The British Association of Dramatherapists, the Panhellenic Professional Union of Dramatherapists, a member of the editing team of a thematic magazine dealing with drama therapy and a volunteer for WWF-Hellas.\n\nDimitris studied Economics &amp; Business Administration and has worked for 15 years in the banking and telecommunications sector on public relations, sales, and client service. He then continued with studies in Integrative Counselling &amp; Psychotherapy and training on treatments of multi-cultural communities following natural disasters. Dimitris is a member of the local community council, a member of the Mountaineering Club \u201cPan\u201d and member of the Hellenic Counselling Society.\n\nThe project runs on the basis of trust and good chemistry between the two founders. The whole concept has been tested in the past through collaboration in smaller scale projects, such as seminars. Their relationship is based on complementarity and mutualism, not rivalries. Driving motivation by their own inspiration, the two of us develop the project locally, being aware of other seminars and educational activities that take place in different places. However, this is the first attempt to connect psychotherapy with nature, while offering access to knowledge stemming from different schools of therapy.\n\nThe team focuses on facilitation of organizational work -not coaching in the seminars- something that allows them to retrieve various tools and previous experience. On the course of this collaboration, the two founders discovered abilities that even themselves were not aware of. Dimitris is very business savvy, while Atalandi is more into the arts and very protected from all forms of institutionalization. Although we\u2019re different, we have managed to develop \u201cthe same language\u201d and excellent communication, allowing the project to move further.\n\nVillage Psy is the work of two persons, who are usually busy with other tasks. Atalandi is raising two small children, while Dimitris is preparing for his exams in the Nursing School. During the last months, Village Psy has been occupying nearly half of their everyday lives. Although it is difficult to understand this time commitment, seeing the results allows them to realize that this is a lot of work. According to Atalandi, the whole process entails a risk. \u201cIt is amazing how you begin with an idea and in a few days or weeks, you see it taking off. The more \u00a0you believe in your vision and the more passionate you are about it, the more you can overcome many personal obstacles\u201d. For Dimitris, this project is important because it allowed him to \u201ctrust collaboration again\u201d.\n\n<strong>Who benefits from Village Psy?</strong>\n\nThe target group of the project includes men and women of 25+ years of age, but there is no restriction in terms of age, gender or background. This audience is distributed as follows:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>\tGeneral population who is interested in self-improvement.</li>\n\n<li>\tFellow psychologists, counselors of mental health or other professionals, who have finished their studies and are looking to come in contact with different approaches in their professional development.</li>\n\n<li>\tAll those who would like to continue their training in counseling or psychotherapy and wish to be exposed to different schools of psychotherapy. This includes students who want to specialize in something they do not know, who in 8 days can experience nine different approaches in order to arrive at what is the most compatible with their own interests.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<strong>The ideal place for Village Psy</strong>\n\nBeyond the personal connection with the village of Pinakates, the inspiration for choosing the location stemmed from the need of a place where people can stay together, ensuring continuity, contact and sharing throughout the process. At Village Psy, everything is done in a\u00a0community, and that is the importance of the word \u201cVillage\u201d.\n\nIn this context, we are collaborating with local hostels and restaurants and the village\u2019s Cultural Association. Other collaborations involve graphic designers and web developers, although all content is generated by them.\n\nAt present, the main objective is to get Village Psy established, attracting more and more people in its sessions. However, there are ambitious ideas for similar activities related to alternative and holistic therapy, running in parallel in the surrounding villages, but also the creation of other such respective villages in other areas, so that they can work and connect together. This would allow Village Psy escape its physical boundaries and work towards the creation of a platform for the generation and diffusion of knowledge, always connecting therapy with the landscape and the natural environment.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>Towards concept validation</strong>\n\nFor this first year (2016) the project runs on experimental mode, under the auspices of Kondyli Publishers (<a href=\"http://www.kondyli.gr\">www.kondyli.gr</a>). This is a thematic publisher, owned by Dimitris, which specializes on issues relevant to psychotherapy. There are thoughts to change the legal entity behind Village Psy, and establish a new one, once the concept is tested and running in a way that is sustainable.\n\nOur project has attracted the attention of the press, with many media publishing press releases, interviews or articles. At the same time, a dedicated website (<a href=\"http://www.village-psy.gr\">www.village-psy.gr</a>) and Facebook page (<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/villagepsy\">www.facebook.com/villagepsy</a>) includes all information that needs to be transferred to potential beneficiaries.\n\nThe first session of Village Psy has taken place between 18-28 August in Pinakates, under the theme \u201cCentaur Chiron: Myth - Trauma - Therapy\u201d. The title pays tribute to the mythological figure who roamed the Mountains of Pelion, where Pinakates is located. This first trial offered opportunities for receiving feedback from participants, aiming to improve the process in following sessions. And it resulted in both creation of a very strong community, but also ideas and solutions beyond our imagination.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<em>Are you developing different ways of approaching mental health and therapy yourself?

Please leave comments either below or directly on to the google doc: <strong><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TUVEXn33W1CUjia31cgtepvSx9Ii3Bp40Hj8tG6gsq8/edit\">full report available</a></strong></em>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>On being Edgeryders. A picture of young Europeans navigating their transition to an independent life.</strong></h3>- summary -\n\nThe report is an analysis of textual material generated through the online platform until mid June, as well as comments after that date and discussions from the March mini-conference and June Living on the Edge conference. Valentina and Rebecca used WEFT QDA, a free qualitative data analysis software package. All codes will be shared online so that anybody wishing to run a search or their own analysis will be able to do so.\n\n<strong>Who Edgeryders are:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Geographic location of participants: France, Italy, UK, US; Spain; Germany; Sweden; Canada; Belgium; Romania (top ten)</li>\n\n<li>a majority are between 20-30 years old (although there are some regular contributors in their forties and fifties); typical age cannot be determined since the information wasn\u2019t requested at sign up on the platform</li>\n\n<li>a majority have university education and many hold postgraduate qualifications; also, they are open to online learning services, highly ICT-literate and knowledge-hungry</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Values and motivations</strong>\n\nEdgeryders are committed to changing the world despite of a dire current socio-economic context and lack of governments\u2019 support. The core motivations discussed in more detail throughout the report are integrity, passion, autonomy.\n\n<strong>Risks Edgeryders are sensitive to:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>fear of exploitation</strong>: either by doing cheap labor to support oneself or use the extra time for meaningful work, or through unpaid work (example internships)</li>\n\n<li><strong>criminalisation: </strong>especially in relation with efforts to enable commons</li>\n\n<li><strong>marginalisation:</strong> feeling distanced from peers and communities or through actions considered \u201cinappropriate\u201d by institutions;</li>\n\n<li><strong>failure to make the transition:</strong> deriving from the risk of living permanent precarious lives; there is a growing realisation that there are no longer \u201cjobs for life\u201d</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Resources</strong>\n\nBoth<strong> real and virtual networks constitute a fundamental structure of support </strong>for Edgeryders: they provide an arsenal of inspiration, motivation, skills, guidance and mentoring, emotional support, and <strong>they</strong> <strong>are channels where individual projects can take off</strong>, through understanding of reciprocity, and the reputational mechanism. For some Edgeryders, peer networks are taking on characteristics associated with families. The latter are indeed the cornerstone of support, emotionally, but also financially.\n\nThe policy-relevant implication here is: <em>who else should be bearing some of the risks \u2013 and enjoying some of the rewards \u2013 of Edgeryders initiatives?</em>\n\n<strong>Responses</strong>\n\nEdgeryders values and skills are naturally at work in all their initiatives. When trying to implement own projects, they do so with innovative thinking, collaboration, dialogue and looking forward, attempting to improve their lives and also those of their peers and their communities\u2019.\n\nEdgeryders ways to live somehow fall into the \u201cindividualization thesis\u201d (Baumann 2001, 2005; Beck 2000) in that they are in charge of their own destiny, and while they have an inclination towards self-reflection, they are also expansive in their option for connectivity, community, collaboration and communication. There is a propensity to go around the system and provide for themselves and others when services are missing, and this changes models of participation.\n\n<strong>Scale</strong>\n\nIn their activities participants act most often through local action and a focus on local problems - leading to stronger community formation and citizenship. Alongside local commitment, <strong>geographical mobility</strong> is highly present, and with positive outcomes: enthusiasm for discoveries, openness to diversity, inclination to creative thinking and problem-solving. The benefits of travel and international mobility expressed by so many of the participants constitute an urgent call to promote mobility for <em>all</em> young people within Europe.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s a need to plead for more institutional support that can help make Edgeryders projects happen. Currently, their (local) initiatives benefit from a lot of network support and collaborations, aided by digital environments and technologies, but one wonders how much more impact they could have if given proper support (not necessarily monetary). \u00a0\n\n<strong>Conclusions:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Edgeryders desire to shape the world through making positive contributions in collaboration with their peers</li>\n\n<li>A common background participants share is that they \u201ccome from the Internet\u201d</li>\n\n<li>The fact that their trajectories are individualized by no means implies that institutional support <em>is not</em> needed</li>\n\n<li>Edgeryders is a group of self-selected, priviledged citizens (in that they have looking forward, to the future views) and some voices are missing</li>\n\n<li>The positive results of this project should be an encouragement for institutions to open up similar channels for communication with groups, but the amount of positive initiatives, energy and willingness of this community to engage are extraordinary and should not be taken for granted</li>\n\n</ul>", "created_at": "2012-08-07 10:45:38", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:06.313492", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1056, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10734, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 6097, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Saw them! </b>\n\nThanks.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-02-03 18:55:54", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:01.831451", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 7, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [6742], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5411, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 5378, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/8/82876ad5e479a5f43c4bb3e5f631c428058847e4.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"489\">\n\nHello everyone, what a pleasure it was to see everyone in one place during \\#lote5. What a great start!\n\nThe first step to enable our op3n collaboration is to agree on how we would like to offer a rewarding and meaningful experience for every participant.\n\nSo here are some things to discuss and finalise within the next week if possible. I will share them with you one at a time to keep information load manageable.\n\nFirst up: Finalise the <a href=\"/en/op3ncare/how-op3ncare-works\">Project Process Description</a>, Tasks and Rewards.\n\n<strong>Can you let me know tasks do you need help with for your part of the project, when you need them completed by and what is your budget allocation for them?\u00a0</strong>\n\nThis would enable us to tie different tasks to the different phases of the program. It would also define the requirements and awards for the different fellowships to motivate people to contribute.\n\n<em>One example: Erik mentioned some field research work he and Tino need done quite soon which requires a specific methodology. Can you let us know what those tasks are, what kind of profile/background/competences people need to have to be able to complete them, what your evaluation criteria are and how much/what you are prepared to reward people for completing them?</em>\n\n<em>Another example: Edgeryders should start the planning of LOTE6, Milestones and recruitment of people to help achieve them, very soon. Perhaps Noemi and myself could summarise them based on our experiences from organsing LOTE events for some time now? </em>\n\n<strong>So how about you? Can you/we get this done by the end of next week?</strong>\n\nIf you need help doing this, just <a href=\"/en/op3ncare/op3n-hangout-welcome-to-the-weekly-online-community-call\">come to the Op3nCare Weekly Community Call next tuesday at 16:30</a> and we can do it together!\n\n", "created_at": "2016-03-03 19:20:29", "updated_at": "2018-05-26 07:08:28.501870", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 376, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5352, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 5319, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<em>Op3nCare is an open collaboration platform hosted by Edgeryders. <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/bNtfZj\">Join</a> our global community to make health- and social care open source, privacy-friendly and participatory.\u00a0</em>\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\">About Op3n Meetups</h2>\n\nOp3nCare's vision is to deploy collective intelligence to the problem of designing care services by communities, for communities. This mean blurring the distinction between researchers, designers, caregivers and care receivers. \u00a0\n\nConsistently with this vision, <strong>the Op3nCare consortium has decided to make its own meetings open for anyone interested to participate</strong>. The ethos is <strong>\"one day of talking, one day of doing\"</strong>: for every day spent on administration issues, we are setting aside another day to do hands-on stuff like design workshops, network data analysis, or hardware hacking, with doors thrown wide open. Additionally, we\u00a0intend to use our meetings to partner up with, and contribute to, events organised by existing communities already working on care, collective intelligence, open source hardware and software hacking.\u00a0We are aware that this marks a clean break with the tradition of closed-doors consortium meetings in European-funded research, even for projects that publish their results with open licenses, and that we are venturing in uncharted territory. But then again, that's why they call it \"research\".\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\">2016</h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">FEBRUARY</h3>\n\n<strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 19.2000007629395px; line-height: 26.112003326416px;\">26/2, Brussels, 09:00 -10:00\u00a0|\u00a0</strong><a href=\"/t/how-to-cope-with-meltdown-in-communities/5106\">How to cope with meltdowns in communities</a>,\u00a0Keynote by John Coate.\n\n<strong>26/2, Brussels, 09:30 -16:15 |\u00a0</strong><a href=\"/en/opencare/let-s-co-create-our-own-welfare-how-to-design-collaborative\">Collaborative inclusion.\u00a0How migrants-residents collaboration can produce social values.

The process was the following:\n\n- There are some Core Team members for each category: design, marketing, front-end, etc.\n\n- Everybody can open tasks: create the logo, implement x html/css, etc.\n\n- The core members can attach to each task an amount of virtual (imaginary) coins: for example, 40000 coins for the best logo (which will be chosen by the community).\n\n- Assembly made this automated, so this 40000 coins going for that user. So it calculates all the coins earned by each one, and estimate the % that each one has taking in to account all the coins earned by others. So this % represent your \"share\" of the \"product\" in comparison to others.\n\n- Once the \"product\" earns real revenues, it is distributed meritocratically according the \"share\" of each one.\n\nSo this is what I would like to do for remunerate and incentive possible collaborators for motivate them to crowd-build the initial version of the platform. Once this initial version was built, the remuneration system could work automatically.\n\nFor that, I've thought that we could do it manually, so in an open an protected document include all the virtual coins earned by each one (with the reference or link of each task). Then, if for example we achieve 20000\u20ac in the crowdfunding campaign, this amount of money will be distributed according the \"share\" earned by each one through their contributions.\n\nFor the crowd-building process we could use tools as Trello or Asana, for example, and attach those virtual coins to each task.\n\nSo everyone contributor will have the same chances to earn money wherever they are from (european, african, etc), as we don't make differences amongst all of them and we believe in equality and meritocracy.\n\nAnd by the way, everyone is welcome!!

You can do the same if you have a UNDP, UNESCO, or UNICEF office in the region, there's a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/16nqDAEbdpP-3UEM4AaWCWYd6tbtfzg8gW4lAdkJA2q8/edit\">template letter</a> ready for being adapted to your context.\n\n2) <strong>Foreign embassies in Brussels</strong>: same here, we're translating a letter to ask for support and adjusting it for cultural nuances.

Ideally you would have a project that LOTE can contribute and help you develop, just asking them to pay for your participation at a conference is not eligible.

In 2014 we were in the ancient caves of Southern Italy, now we found ourselves in a repurposed warehouse in Brussels. Quixotic to pragmatic; swapping catholic for protestant, wine for Leffe. Apart from that sentence I\u2019ll give the purple prose a rest - last time I was getting\u00a0<a href=\"http://jimmytidey.co.uk/blog/lote4-the-stewardship-matera/\">carried away by views of medieval churches down the valley</a>, this time I\u2019ll stick to what happen at the conference.\u00a0\n\nLOTE is a conference organised by Edgeryders, but what is Edgeryders? It\u2019s an online forum, it\u2019s a community, a Europe-wide network. The community coauthors reports about political issues, and collectively they run the conference and other events. \u2018Distributed think tank\u2019 seems to capture some aspects of it, if imperfectly. I left LOTE4 thinking that the first rule of Edgeryders is that you don\u2019t define Edgeryders. This year, we had a discussion about what Edgeryder\u2019s \u2018elevator pitch\u2019 is - a complete reversal.\n\nWhen you try to say what Edgeryders is - or ought to be - there are two perspectives to switch between. There is the offer that Edgeryders makes to the world, its sales pitch for consultancy work, and there is the offer that it makes to its members. What does it do for it\u2019s members? I liked\u00a0<a href=\"http://johncoate.com/\">John Coate\u2019s</a>\u00a0(more of him later) metaphor: Edgeryders is for \u2018free electrons\u2019, people full of energy bouncing chaotically across society and looking for something to orbit around.\n\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ladyniasan\">Nadia EL-Imam</a>, one of the founders, described \u201ca drive towards a very specific position in the labour market: full time employment. But that seems to be less and less available.\u201d Edgeryders is the alternative. Nadia also described a \u2018transgressive\u2019 attitude to expertise which comes when people take on multiple roles. Edgeryders offers a coworking space, with a new definition of working and without the space. It\u2019s a place to locate yourself alongside traditional employment.\n\nBut for the community to exist at all, they have to keep winning bids and getting funding. To win bids it\u2019s necessary (but not sufficient) to offer a product or service that people can understand. We had a session discussing what that could be, one interesting answer came from\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/gquaggiotto\">Giulio Quaggiotto</a>. Edgeryders, to him, is a way for bureaucracies to contract with people they otherwise could not. Government agencies can\u2019t directly employ hackers and artists, they are too risky, and in any case bureaucracies don\u2019t know where to find them. On this understanding, Edgeryders is to it\u2019s members what securitisation is to mortgages.\u00a0\n\nEdgeryders has been very involved with the European Capitals of Culture program, helping the city of Matera win the competition. In this context the organisation has another utility. Even if a local government has formed links with the creatives and activists in their own town, Edgeryders brings a pan European dimension. That\u2019s very important in programs which require international or European networks, of which the Capitals of Culture program is one.\n\nI felt we missed the point that Edgeryders brings a certain kind of sexiness. We contrasted Edgeryders with McKinsey (a very established consultancy), trying to work out what made Edgeryders unique. Which is funny, because if Edgeryders is anything, it\u2019s unique. What do I think McKinsey do to win a bid? Probably take everyone out for dinner at a posh restaurant. Well, for a certain audience, Edgeryders can trump that:\u00a0<a href=\"http://discosoupe.org/\">Disco Soupe</a>. On the Saturday night of the conference everyone went to a community kitchen and prepared dinner from left over vegetables with music to keep the energy levels up. It\u2019s exotic and honest and fresh in a way that McKinsey will never be - it may not be for everyone, but for a particular audience it\u2019s catnip.\n\nThe difficulty is that Edgeryders\u2019 members all have strong and divergent political opinions, so whatever the process of instrumentalising the community is, it has to avoid upsetting people. Elevator pitches don\u2019t capture nuances, and the nuances will matter.\n\nWhich brings us to the keynote talk, by John Coate, about how (digital) communities can avoid melting down. John was a founding member of The Farm, a famous cooperative, and also a foundational member of The Well and SF Gate - very much the right person to speak on the topic.\u00a0\n\nThe talk was so good I could happily recount it all, but the notes are\u00a0<a href=\"https://hackpad.com/How-to-cope-with-meltdowns-in-communities-John-Coate-pT0JIs9tkWp\">available here</a>\u00a0so I won\u2019t. Personally, I was curious to note how much of the advice resonated with my experience of writing. I got a lot from his idea that the \u2018default setting\u2019 in humans is to misunderstand. I\u2019m often infuriated when people can\u2019t understand written communication that I\u2019ve spent so long crafting. It\u2019s helpful to remember that if you are trying to express difficult ideas that aren\u2019t fully formed then misunderstandings are commonplace. It\u2019s normal to have your words misconstrued, especially across cultural or disciplinary boundaries.\n\nJohn is a veteran of the San Francisco counter culture, which gave birth to Silicon Valley and is the origin of so much of the online world we are familiar with. He suggested that Edgeryders could also embody a kind of innovation that can\u2019t come from conventional institutions, just as The Well did before.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat is that innovation? It\u2019s about building systems that link people and organisations quicker and more effectively. It doesn\u2019t have to be digital, but digital is giving us an amazing laboratory for testing new ideas. Digital networks make it easier to measure changes, and policy makers love evidence. Digital also means that geographical distance is less important, international communities can form more easily.\u00a0\n\nBut Edgeryders also understands that networks are hybrid, the offline component is just as important as the online.\u00a0\n\nYears of sociological research have shown how important an individual\u2019s interpersonal connections are for their wellbeing. Now we are starting to apply that knowledge. One idea came up that Edgeryders is on a micro scale what The Atlas of Economic Complexity is on the macro scale. If everyone can navigate the network for themselves, hierarchical power structures are much less important.\u00a0\n\nI wanted to get down my thoughts on the big ideas from LOTE5, and to capture the change since 2014. Documentation is always a mantra at LOTE. I hope there isn\u2019t so much here that it\u2019s hopelessly confusing, but, as John Coate\u00a0pointed out, sometimes that happens.\u00a0\n\nIn another analogy, he said \u201cThere is an emotional sub-carrier with the words that you write\u201d, what he calls the vibe. Write a post when you\u2019re pissed off and people can tell, even if you try to hide it. The vibe in Brussels was positive, optimistic and\u00a0ambitious, but then you already know that from my emotional sub-carrier. Nadia said she wanted to eat McKinsey\u2019s breakfast, I reckon there\u2019s a good chance that Edgeryders can at least add Disco Soupe to the menu.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-02-29 14:29:53", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:31.031681", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1272, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 15.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2569, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8418, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 4996, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Ok it's here!

That project outlined the history and present conditions of the Scajaquada River. The river was buried under the city of Buffalo in the 1800\u2019s as a way to keep from dealing with the smell and pollution found in the water. Parts of the river remain buried and it continues to be polluted even as it is monitored by state and federal organizations.\u00a0 My research and installation took about three years to put together, and it presented the complexity of how economy, government policies, lack of planning, lack of accessible information and climate change can dramatically erode an environmental and cultural asset. </span>\n\n<span>It was during this installation that I was approached to consider doing a similar project about the Bagmati River that flows though the middle of Kathmandu, Nepal. I was excited about extending my body of work beyond the Western Hemisphere and to working with a culturally diverse community. After initial discussions with professionals, museum staff and community members in Kathmandu, it was clear that there was a great deal of interest in me starting a new project investigating the Bagmati River. I was granted a residency at the Kathmandu Contemporary Arts Center a few months later, and my research began in earnest. Jason Dilworth joined the venture early in 2016 and his work has been integral to the project\u2019s success. During Jason\u2019s and my first trip to Kathmandu in March of 2016, we were able to strengthen past connections to the project while building a larger network of individuals and groups committed to improving conditions in the Kathmandu Valley and the communities outside the valley who live along the river. Support for the <i>Bagmati River Arts Project</i> has grown steadily from the beginning through the assistance of Hatchfund donors, travel support through SUNY Fredonia and a Burchfield Penney Art Center grant. It has continued to grow through the sales of the project\u2019s publications and the sales of my artwork. </span>\n\n<span>The <i>Bagmati River Arts Project</i>\u00a0includes:</span>\n\n<span>A. an exhibition at the Siddhartha Art Gallery at Barbar Mahal Revisited in Kathmandu opening on November 20th, 2016. My artwork, water data from the Bagmati River and the video documentary will be presented on the second floor. The first will include artwork by Nepalese artists whose attention focuses with issues related to the Bagmati River. We are also working with the fine art faculty and students at Kathmandu University who will be creating work related to their cultural connections to the river.</span>\n\n<span>B.<a href=\"http://www.bagmatiriverartproject.com/project-publication-2/\"> a book</a> is being published (available in November 2016) that documents the importance of the Bagmati River, the cause for the pollution, climate change effects on the Kathmandu Valley and its groundwater, and plans to improve the condition of the river. The role of this publication, like the exhibition, is to use aesthetics as a way to make the scientific data accessible to a wider audience. Artists from the United States and Nepal will be included in the publication. The publication will be made available in Kathmandu at no cost to the residents to assure wide dissemination of its data to a diverse communities. It also will be available in the United States and sold as a way to fund other parts of this project and future projects. A link to this finished book is available on this website.</span>\n\n<span>C. <a href=\"http://www.bagmatiriverartproject.com/videos/bagmati/\">a documentary video</a> will document the project and include interviews with water quality and health professionals, community members as well a policy maker in Kathmandu. Songs by traditional Nepalese folk singers are incorporated throughout the video including a commissioned song about the Bagmati River. A link to this finished documentary is available on this website.</span>\n\n<span>D. a brochure and poster written in Nepalese will also provide important accessible scientific and health data about the river. The poster and brochures will be distributed to the communities that live along the entire length of the river in Nepal. Members of the Bagmati River Expedition 2015 team, who created a comprehensive report about the river\u2019s water quality, microinvertebrates, avian population and plastics data, have already established connections in these communities. We are working with Sujan Chitrakar and his graphic design students in designing the posters and brochures. Sujan is the Academic Program Coordinator and an Assistant Professor for Kathmandu University\u2019s School of Art, Center for Art and Design.</span>\n\n<span>All elements of the project listed above will be finished and presented at the opening of the exhibition in November 20, 2016 when Jason and I plan to return to Kathmandu.</span>\n\n<span>An exciting extension to this project is the plan to ship the artwork, publication, documentary, brochures and posters back to the United States where it will tour around the country and, possibly, internationally. Water issues are a worldwide concern and the Bagmati\u2019s perils are not unique. Our hope is that, by touring the exhibition and by combining it with site-specific exhibitions, audiences can create connections between their region and other global communities. There is a good deal that can be learned from the history of the Bagmati as well as from the grass roots efforts that created the Saturday Bagmati River clean-up program and the successful community health initiatives supported by the non-government organizations. All of these efforts has unified the underserved residents of the Kathmandu Valley to address the basic needs in their communities while creating hope and motivating government involvement.\u00a0\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>The Burchfield Penney Art Center in Buffalo, New York is very interested in the merits of the project and they have volunteered to promote and organize the touring exhibition.</span>\n\n<span>For more information please contact <a href=\"mailto:alberto@albertorey.com\"><span>alberto@albertorey.com</span></a>.</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<hr>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>Project Leaders</strong>\n\n<strong>Alberto Rey</strong> \u2013 Distinguished Professor in the Department of Visual Arts and New Media at the State University of New York at Fredonia, Director and Founder of S.A.R.E.P.

As per Ben's suggestions, the Confessional was set up as a closed group to ensure safety; members have to be individually approved. For this reason, non-members do not see the notifications from its updates the way they see notifications from fully open projects. Almost all projects on Edgeryders are fully open.\n\nI am not carving at all! Everything is written on water. It works like this: when I go running, my mind wanders. Recently, in Rome (I was running along the Appia Antica, on a road that must not have looked that different in the time of Emperor Hadrian) the three rules that had been floating in my head came together into a sort of structure. From then on, I have been poking holes in that structure, then plugging them. They already have one user: me. This version of protocol is, tentatively, how I myself want to live. Just like Benedict's Rule, it is not always easy to conform.\n\nFor what it is worth, it sounds like the role of individual freedom in the discussion you mention could be downplayed a bit. The reason is this: the unMonastery does not have any cohercive power, so that there is no need to fear its cohercion (neither does the monastery). It's a bit like being married: when you tie the knot, you assume certain duties and responsibilities towards your beloved \u2013 and yes, they do limit your personal freedom. But in the end, no one can make you be a good spouse if you don't want to \u2013 and if you find them impossible to follow, you will divorce or run away. Both divorce and escape act are expensive, so you will likely ponder them before you execute them. In other words, those duties are there to protect you from occasional straying, not to straitjacket you into a life impossible for who you are: this would be not only cruel, but impossible.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-04-06 13:00:24", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:04.070619", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 347, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [21157], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18291, "user_id": 243, "topic_id": 3975, "post_number": 5, "raw": "ok\u00a0\n\nI'll write it all in the wiki\n\n", "created_at": "2014-12-07 14:12:12", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:42.166427", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 14, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [17311], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30999, "user_id": 69, "topic_id": 1519, "post_number": 55, "raw": "<b>sweet!</b>\n\nthanks a lot, alberto - i'll spend mine wisely\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-29 14:48:16", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:50.533899", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 14, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [28753], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6423, "user_id": 3622, "topic_id": 6390, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/c/cbfab4e7b3c21263ef72d9e9d1fd87bfd501c35f.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"241\">\n\n<strong>Calling all fellow members,</strong>\n\n<strong>We want you to perform in our next video campaign</strong>.

Do you think we will see that number rise with automation? \u00a0Of the emplyed, how many do you think love their jobs, their working conditions, and the way their job makes the world a better place?\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>\t\tWhat we found is that there is a growing sense of dissatisfaction. Millennials do not want to work like this. We do not want to live like this. It is even more broken than that! We are so dependent on the more powerful that we have very little power over our own lives left. That is visible in our jobs, but it is also true for most of how we live and work.</li>\n\n</ul></li>\n\n<li>\t<strong>So how do we change things? Take to the streets? </strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\tIt\u2019s is hard to take part in several weeks of demonstrations, when you have to be<strong>\u00a0</strong>back at your job on Monday (that\u2019s if you have one at all). You may lose your job if you are not, and then your savings, and then your nice rented flat in the city, and have to start from scratch again. You may even end up on a blacklist for trying to improve life for yourself and others in your society.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tAnd it\u2019s a global phenomenon: what the average tenant in the city and the average small-scale farmer in South America have in common is that a good share of their profits goes to those who have the \u201cmeans of production\u201d, the \u201cmeans of market access\u201d and the \u201cmeans of living\u201d (which is, residential buildings, transport infrastructure, energy services and so on).</li>\n\n<li>\t\tSo what to do with capitalism-as-we-know-it? If we want the power to be back with the people, should we seize the means of production? It has been tried before, and it was not a big success story. Lots of death and suffering. It\u2019s 2017 now, and we won\u2019t try that again.</li>\n\n<li>We don't have to seize anything, because everything we need is available for free or for really cheap. High tech has become dirt cheap. A lot of software and knowledge has become open source. And young people are highly educated and experimenting with many new ways of using technologies and human organising.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tOur vision is to create our own means of production, our means of market access, and means of living. We believe we can create whatever we need for sustainable, even restorative living out of the little we have. Of course this means we will have to be creative, more dependent on our peers, frugal, and good team players \u2013 but Millennials, as they call us, are all of this. In late 2011, Edgeryders started the work of finding and combining whatever solutions to do-it-yourself, autonomous living and well-being people are developing out there.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tOur long term vision is to become a place where, for the first time ever, all of these solutions come together and put people in control of their lives. The place could be a city neighborhood, a village or even a seasteading platform\u2013 it does not matter. The OpenVillage is a comprehensive set of open tech solutions and collective action strung together by a common narrative. It is not an imperialistic model, people will be encouraged to remix and implement what works in their own context with support from a global online community of peers.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tWhen we get there, how will the world look like? Whenever we have a problem, we'll say \"We can solve that ourselves.\" We will no longer wait for the government, or demonstrate in front of the government after waiting too long. We will no longer apply for a loan to the bank, or rob the bank when they esteem us unworthy of credit :)</li>\n\n<li>\t\tWe will have gardens to grow our food, robots that help us to grow and harvest and transport it. We will have houses that are simple but our own. We will have enough solar electricity to power cars, but not enough to power a TV that is running commercials. We will have nice communal kitchens, a creche for raising our kids, a store for sharing tools and materials for free, and a soildarity group to rely on when we are sick or old. We will have a culture that nurtures intimacy and locality, and a technosocial infrastructure that connect us with the world.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tAll of that is not rocket science, and will never fill the whole work day. We will have a lot of free time to spend it in nature and with fellow openvillagers. If we like, we may also spend it in our labs and workshops to further improve the OpenVillage.</li>\n\n</ul></li>\n\n<li>\t<strong>What matters now is that together we make progress, step by step, in putting together all the bits and pieces of the OpenVillage. \u201cBeing in the making\u201d means doing things, as a community, that</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\tMake a contribution in and of themselves. For example, by connecting activists and hackers with government officials in a safe and neutral space, we were able to get some dialogue going in places like Belarus and Egypt, where the relationship between authorities and civil society are tense. By prototyping a new way of living and working together in The Reef, we are able to offer high quality accommodation and mutual care to people in the social innovation space, and free them somewhat from financial constraints as they focus on their projects.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tAre \u201cpieces\u201d of the OpenVillage ecosystem. We are aware we need to reinvent not just tech solutions, but they way tech meshes with the social system, and its ethics. For example, The Reef is a protorype for one kind of dwelling in the OV.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tAre sustainable, ideally profitable. We need not to burn ourselves down in these ten years; and we will need money when the time comes.</li>\n\n</ul></li>\n\n<li>\u200b<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-a59e9f87-bff2-3b91-e152-1950cea89dec\">So we started a company...</b>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><b>\u200b</b>You can get involved in 3 ways:</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>Invest in projects</strong>. If you are really committed to getting behind this vision, you could become our business partners. We work on some \u201cflagship\u201d projects with a view to spinning them off as their own business entities. Right now we have three: one is The Reef, which is to become a network of live-work spaces that doubles up as a supply chain and partnership network. Our first prototype is up and running in Brussels, and we are doing due diligence for the second one, which will probably be in Tunis, in partnership with the World Bank.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Hire us</strong>. Dream of working with hackers, activists and artists from your edge on your change management problem, or innovation drive? Want to see how a super-diverse, yet respectful and safe, workspace can be? We can make it happen.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Become a member of The Reef.</strong>\u00a0Our live-work space that doubles up as a supply chain and european partnership network.

This would have allowed people to get organized before the event, present the idea, express the needs, find the resources and already have a clear plan on what each and every person would be working on.

It's worth mentioning that the modules themselves can be studied on their own without any intended course path in mind. I studied both broad humanities and mathematics via the Open University and am currently working towards achieving a engineering degree via a composite of my completed mathematics modules and short 'brick and motor' practical engineering courses yet to be completed.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<b>My experience of this online education has lead me to two conclusions:</b>\n\n\u00a0\n\nFirstly module courses supplied by the OU specifically are <u>low cost</u> in comparison to the those supplied via traditional university.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSecondly, the <u>quality is directly comparable to the quality of teaching supplied by traditional university</u> and in some cases higher.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOn a side note: It opens up a educational path more fitting for those that the traditional methods have failed.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<b>Expanding on these points:</b>\n\n<u>Cost:</u>\n\nYou can achieve from the Open University a named BA (Hons) for roughly a third of the price of a brick and mortar university education within England.\n\nRecently the cost of a university education in England has increased dramatically. England is now the most expensive place in the world to get a degree. This has unsurprisingly lead to fall in university applications. The Open University has also increased it's fees (Important to note that the OU raise was forced onto them by the government) but it still remains around a third of the cost of a brick and mortar degree. My prediction is that this forced raise to OU degree will price out those who previous studied via the OU (For instance, people traditional education has failed, and life long learners) and break the business model, but we shall see.\n\nThe benefits of cheap education to society are multitude.\n\n<u>Quality:</u>\n\nHaving studied at both a brick and mortar university and the Open University I would say that, perversely, I received more tutor contact and feedback from the OU.\n\nWhen studying via the OU, I went once a month to an optional evening class to meet the tutor, as well as having phone and frequent email contact.\n\nI also had access to an online forum in which I could meet and discuss with others on the course, as well as my tutor. The quality of contact was also higher, I felt more able to ask specific questions and was more confident that the questions would be fully resolved.\n\nI believe that a digital education can not only be comparable to a physical one, but in many ways surpass that given by a brick and mortar university. If I was given the choice again, to go to a physical university, or to invest more in digital learning, I would have choose without hesitation digital learning via OU. It initially allowed me an education, as the traditional establishments failed in my circumstance. It now continues to allow me to pursue knowledge freely and low cost (comparably) whilst leaving me free to work and play in my own time.\n\nIf properly managed, a high quality education can be delivered digitaly. Such establishments have the potential to be cheaper and more flexible, increasing access to those that otherwise would miss out.\n\nSo are digital learning establishments the future? Maybe. I would certainly like to see more of them.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-20 17:03:48", "updated_at": "2017-09-01 07:44:42.134950", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 806, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16665, "user_id": 3362, "topic_id": 6225, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Notes Open Insulin Global calls</b>\n\nFor keeping an overview, I decided to bundle the notes from the fortnightly calls we have with people from BioFoundry and Counter Culture Labs on Monday mornings (9 am CET).\n\nYou can find it in the Drive <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PSDmsz_gfNu_FD3ECISIn4krfXcTfhctDPrJMkBxUyI/edit\">here</a>.\n\nAnyone is welcome to call in, the next one is on June 12th.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-06-01 10:31:01", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:33.230415", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 75, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6306, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 6273, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Here's a rough draft how I plan to replace the whole Drupal based implementation of edgeryders.eu within the tech budget limits of the World Bank project.

After all the years of experimentation (and Drupal was quite flexible for that), it's time to simplify and get compact, proper software do the job. Now it's 2017, and unlike 2012, there is a lot of modern and compact open source software around now.\n\nSo I propose to split the current Edgeryders platform into several parts, as follows:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>edgeryders.eu:</strong> A custom Ruby software with a single login, providing multiple pieces of custom functionality:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>Static pages.</strong> Some static pages about the company and its projects (including Reef). Only editable for admin users. Technically part of the custom Ruby software. Using a Rails engine for blogs, which allows full HTML. Using Bootstrap markup and layout, incl. a quick reference on the screen when editing a post.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Forum (\"Challenges and responses\"):</strong> the community space where all the content collection and public-facing content discussion takes place. A custom, highly compact (!) forum-type software application that is highly optimized for low bandwidth / site loading speed, and access from developing regions. That includes very good foreign script support (Devanagari, Arabic etc.).</li>\n\n<li><strong>Reef:</strong> A separate part of the custom Ruby application, with features for space management, event announcements and other custom tasks for The Reef. There could be other, similar pieces of software on that same domain for other spaces, like the one that will belong to the MENA youth platform.</li>\n\n</ol>\n</li>\n\n<li><strong>PayCoupons:</strong> People's PayCoupons username, offers, hourly rates and GTCs would be listed both on their Matrix profile and edgeryders.eu custom software profile, in a dedicated linked field. Also, the forums software would have PayCoupons links after every mention of a username, and ways to tip people for good / helpful posts, using small amounts of PayCoupons.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Github repository:</strong> all software related tasks of the custom forums software are handled here.</li>\n\n<li><strong>riot.edgeryders.eu:</strong> Riot web client for the Matrix protocol, see https://riot.im/ . It is one of multiple clients that people can use to collaborate via Matrix, so there is no need to include it on the main domain. On the main domain, there will simply be a site explaining what Matrix is, how to join, and linnking to several options including riot.edgeryders.eu. Used for all Edgeryders collaboration needs around projects. Everyone who wants to be part of the Edgeryders codebase would take part here. Includes all collaboration with team members, community managers etc.. No login integration with the Ruby software needed, as Matrix is an instant messaging protocol, so the idea is that everyone has their own username, independent of any particular website. The custom forum application would link to that username for instant messaging etc.. We would do no (!) custom changes to the Riot or Synapse codebases.</li>\n\n<li><strong>synapse.edgeryders.eu:</strong> Matrix (http://matrix.org/) server installation, using the Synapse reference server ( https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse ). Not linked anywhere, as it is just the server, providing the \"rooms\", while people always connect via clients.</li>\n\n<li><strong>edgesense.edgeryders.eu:</strong> Stand-alone Edgesense installation, using the data of the forum software. No login integration with the forum software, as it has only very few users and these would simply stay logged in permanently.</li>\n\n<li><strong>ethnography.edgeryders.eu (optional / later):</strong> A stand-alone software for tagging the edgeryders.eu content. Can work on the same database, and its data may be used by the edgeryders.eu forum software installation for showing related content etc.. This software can be based on Annotator.js, with the extensions developed for it for the Open Ethnographer Drupal software.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nImplementation proposals for the custom software application:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Essentially: it will be a custom application in Ruby, developed by my brother Daniel and administered and managed by me. Daniel has in total has 8 years experience in Ruby and is very fast at implementing features with that framework. He only does Ruby \u2013 not like me who does a bit of everything (and is correspondingly slow). I don't know another developer whom I'd trust to replicate ederyders.eu until the launch phase in October, but  together with Daniel I can get it done. We have worked together extensively on PayCoupons, so we have a lot of routine working together \u2026</li>\n\n<li>I am sick and tired of Drupal-style overly complex and \"super configurable\" software where everything takes about 4x longer than planned. In the future we'll have super compact code instead. There will not be the current flexibility for admins to change things around by configuring them, but our desired feature set is quite well-known now. We can have Ruby courses though, so everyone interested will be able to make small changes to the website in code. Content changes are all still possible in the admin interface, of course.</li>\n\n<li>The forum base software would be either <a href=\"https://thredded.org/\">Thredded</a> (10,500 lines Ruby code only, MIT licence) or <a href=\"https://github.com/discourse/discourse\">Discourse</a> (full fledged forum, 140,000 lines Ruby code).</li>\n\n<li>Boards of the forum will be called \"Challenges\", messages will be called \"Stories\" (as in \"Add my story\").</li>\n\n<li>The editor should be <a href=\"http://prosemirror.net/\">ProseMirror</a> (MIT licence). It <a href=\"http://prosemirror.net/examples/markdown/\">outputs natively to Markdown</a>, but allows rich text editing as well. When editing in source, there should be a live preview using a second editor widget, just as on Stack Exchange. It is basically as capable as our current editor, while allowing faster editing for markdown skilled users (esp. on mobile devices), and avoiding all the crazy security considerations around \"Full HTML\" in editors. More editors that can output in markdown format: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10454054\">see here</a>.</li>\n\n<li>Another custom component will export all (!) content into a public JSON file, for an external Edgesense installation to consume.</li>\n\n<li>A simple text box with a hiearchical link list in Markdown will do to define the contents of the main menu.</li>\n\n<li>All (!) existing public content of edgeryders.eu will be migrated to challenges and responses in the new custom forum application. That may happen only after the end of the OpenCare project, however.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Edit:</strong> The current project journalling and task functionality of Drupal will be lost. If you want a realtime message style collaboration solution like Matrix, that's what you get :-) I proposed (task based) Taiga.io before but it got turned down \u2013 that's fine, as for software issues I'll simply use the Github issue tracker then. You'll have to find your own ways to manage tasks, as there will not be structured support for it. For example, a simple Google Spreadsheet could do for team internal task management.\n\nThe existing journal and task contents would be migrated to Google Docs and Spreadsheets documents, as that is where all our other project knowledge resides. Wiki documents would be partially migrated to static pages on edgeryders.eu (in case of the website manual etc.), and otherwise also to Google Docs.", "created_at": "2017-05-08 00:52:30", "updated_at": "2017-09-27 17:33:11.717835", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1354, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 156.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3791], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14756, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3637, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Remember Millie</b>\n\nGoes by ElaMi5.

The mission is to develop responsibility within Ukrainians for public space, to promote their integration into active and independent community for the changes in the society.</span></span>\n\n<span><span>Their projects can be divided into 4 categories: Space Neighbourhood - establishing friendly relations between neighbors as a first step to building active communities of apartment buildings. Than social activities to promote active people for the development of communities they are in. Local changes via development of home yards and team-building projects that will develop civic values, but also will be useful to society, which will have a positive impact on social capital. In addition, they are working within business companies, in order to promote social responsibility</span></span>\n\n<span><span><a href=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/8/8c7c4c812a9df30f746ff78482fe9a399afc36a9.jpg\">\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/8/8c7c4c812a9df30f746ff78482fe9a399afc36a9.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\"><br></a></span></span>\n\n<span><span>The main founder of the initiative is Mariya Nasedkina, who is in particular at the moment has a full time job within Pact organization - a civil society strengthening project in Ukraine. Initiative \"Dyvovijni\" was doung by her right after Maidan to teach communities of social collaboration and \"doing in actions\" idea.</span></span>\n\n<span><span>How did you get started and your current situation?</span></span>\n\n<span><span>The initiative has started some time ago, when I had an idea and some motivation to change things in my country. The situation here was bad thus i have decided to improve it. I think that everyone should begin from themselves, and by doing this to motivate others. </span></span>\n\n<span><span>For a while I was living abroad, and have seen great examples of proactivity. After returning back home, i had only this desire to start the initiative yet I didn\u2019t know much about how to administer it, and generally to make it happen. That\u2019s why for some time i was searching for an interested person to start the project with me. After two months I finally found another person, that is a doer on the matter </span></span>\n\n \n\n<span><span>We have started from the most simple things, by deciding to create a small event - cleaning of the little forest. 8 people came. And that laid the beginning of our activities and crystallization of our strategy. </span></span>\n\n \n\n<span><span>Who is involved as your team?</span></span>\n\n<span><span>At the moment it\u2019s 6 of us. Each of us have other jobs, yet we are thinking of ways of turning into the social enterprise in order to spare more time for the initiative itself. We have sociologist, analytic, project manager, designer. All of us are involved in development of the project, netherless our duties and thus work outlines are blurred.</span></span>\n\n \n\n<span><span><a href=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b9258ef4b54ec11b565fe886e26793dd3eec6aba.jpg\">\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b9258ef4b54ec11b565fe886e26793dd3eec6aba.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\"><br></a></span></span>\n\n \n\n<span><span>At first people were praising us, yet didn\u2019t do much. Thus we formed a concept on teaching how we are making projects and by doing so other projects started to develop. We have also formed a general yearly strategy of development in a general meeting. Daily tasks we are doing mostly online. </span></span>\n\n \n\n<span><span>Throughout 1,5-2 years more than 30 events have been made, with around 500 people visiting them. Our main themes for projects include urban ones, that we use as instrument, and changes with the public spaces. We are aiming on target involvement, and method of positive changes. </span></span>\n\n \n\n<span><span>The idea is what motivate me and of course my team. The main positiveness that I find in my work is the people in actions. The main problem is not fast results of your done work. Since responsibility, proactive takes time to build. Values do not change quick. At the moment we are at the process of understanding the next steps, either initiative would turn to have much bigger impact or will end locally </span></span>\n\n \n\n<span><span>We have decided to create NGO, for the matter of being more secured to receive finance support, due to the fact, that it\u2019s quite hard to do so while being an unofficial initiative. We were working for two years without any support, donating our own money in order to buy some materials for projects.Another aspect is institutive help. Without previous project/grant experience it\u2019s almost impossible to receive some financial help. Yet we have managed without any grants or financial support, due to the fact that for now we are having such expenses: computer, technical facilities, materials for projects, print and promotion. often we are inputting from our own money or using crowdfunding</span></span>\n\n \n\n<span><span>For this upcoming year we have put 3 tasks:</span></span>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>Divovjni hang outs: from 1 to 3 events per month with enhancement on activism and collaboration</span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>Good neighboring: rise of the level of trust within the neighborhood</span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>Corporate team building: corporate social events/team building to enhance social responsibility. this is the good foundation of the development of social entrepreneurship. </span></span>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<span><span>we have some good examples in other countries that we are investigating and taking account. For instance, such projects as :\u201d Do something\u201d, \u201cgood neighborhood\u201d, \u201cRandom acts of kindness\u201d. </span></span>\n\n \n\n<span><span>Contacts of the organization:</span></span>\n\n<span>dyvovyzhni.strikingly.com</span>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgb(85, 85, 85); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 21.75px; text-align: center; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/dyvovyzhni\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; line-height: 1; font-family: inherit; text-decoration: none; color: rgb(51, 119, 204);\">www.facebook.com/</a></div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgb(85, 85, 85); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 21.75px; text-align: center; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/dyvovyzhni\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; line-height: 1; font-family: inherit; text-decoration: none; color: rgb(51, 119, 204);\">dyvovyzhni</a></div>\n\n<div> </div>", "created_at": "2015-08-03 03:50:30", "updated_at": "2018-06-05 14:41:24.890268", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1103, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 56.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 15286, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 3737, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>And crisis mapping, and more</b>\n\nGreat session proposal, I'll surely join in. Some additions that come to mind:\n\nCrisis mapping is a rather well-known way of citizen-driven disaster response. It's work done by, for example, the <a href=\"http://blog.standbytaskforce.com/2014/10/08/ebola-activation-update-8th-october-2014/\">Standby Task Force</a>, involving for example <a href=\"http://ohdr.nethope.opendata.arcgis.com/\">crisis mapping for the current Ebola outbreak</a>. And for the IT world's own variety of disasters, there is also a collaborative <a href=\"http://www.zone-h.org/archive\">computer security incident database</a>.\n\nAnother interesting new citizen tool for disaster response is <a href=\"http://peacekeeper.org/faq/\">Peacekeeper</a>, \"an organization that builds and advocates voluntary systems of emergency protection\". They have an app which kind of is like a 911 call to your neighbors. While that is clearly tainted by US \"rightwing nuts\", I find the concept interesting and relevant.\n\nRegarding the sensor-integration that you have in mind, the closest thing I know is <a href=\"http://www.gdacs.org/\">GDACS</a> (you'll probably know it too, it's a UN / EU project). Take something like this project, add case information about epidemics and diseases, and allow citizens to add all other incidents (like place and date of robberies when travelling etc.), and we'd have a system that allows informed risk assessment for everyone, everywhere by querying that database. There would be no need to rely on blunt statistics anymore, which are just aggregates of such data. To my knowledge, there is no system aggregating all spatial risk data so far, esp. not on a global scale, but clearly there <em>should be</em> :)\n\nPersonally I would <em>love</em> to see a network of citizens and their resource being able to do disaster response on their own. A network is uniquely apt, since it has many redundant links that can take the additional load when a disaster disrupts part of the network. Say, a family might be able to take in a second family who lost their home in a flood for half a year or so, it just is not a comfortable permanent situation.\n\nI'm just not happy with central entities like AirBnB taking a role in this (from all central entities, companies I trust the least). So yes, I advocate an engineered \"disaster-response network\" of citizens, and would like to gather other people's hints and tips about what is already there and how to build it.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-10-18 15:35:30", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:26.075414", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 444, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19151, "user_id": 1487, "topic_id": 1946, "post_number": 17, "raw": "<b>(having to put subjects on comments is a nuisance)</b>\n\nI haven't and will not say this or that will not work. I don't believe in that kind of thinking.\n\nDespite any numbers you may take pride in I would argue that you can never know what has not yet happened because of shortcoming of the system. Which is generally why I am not a big fan of measurements. <strong>Especially on the edge where I believe Quality trumps quantity.</strong>\n\nI would not want to debate design with you until we've first had a change to create a shared vision/understanding of what we mean by design. Until then, putting down design based on any pre-existing notions about what design is, seems pointless (and on a personal note: a bit hurtful). Again, another reason I suggegsted <a href=\"/t/making-lote3/360/designating-purpose\">the session</a>.\n\nI expect a design process will have all kinds of expressions. Things will surface that will be very challenging to implement (in which case we'll at least have a roadmap of where we want to go and a way to re-evaluate our priorities and actions). There will be superficial things that can make big differences - such as inconsitencies and emphasis (I can point some of these out already, but I can't yet describe a clear fix without doing some kind of design process - which though I am tempted to do on my own - I think is wrong).\n\nAt this point in time your invitation to \"improve anything you see\" is an empty geture for me (and feels like other open-source \"invitations\" I've come across). There is no room yet in the current dynamics for me to contribute (I've tried) what I have to offer. I realize that for that to happen I need to first create a space for to happen in ER (offline and online). Again, another reason I suggseted <a href=\"/t/making-lote3/360/designating-purpose\">the session</a>. I believe this will be easier to do face to face then in this kind of online-dynamic (ask [Noemi] with whom I've had an opportunity to spend face-to-face time). However if that (a session) does not work out I promise to make an effort to do that here, online (though for now, until Lote3, I am kind of holding back).\n\nMaybe to give you a taste of my thinking. I have a clear (and written) \"purpose of EdgeRyders\". In my mind, every task (small or large) regarding (but not limited to) the ER space goes through a question \"how is this action aligned with the purpose of ER?\". Right now I am experiencing mostly unclear alignment or mis-alignment (that is to say efforts that may be undermining the purpose of ER).\n\n", "created_at": "2013-09-15 04:51:19", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:46.833738", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 491, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 10.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [17502], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21687, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5349, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Thanks!</b>\n\nGreat stuff.

What the government should be targeting is real goals, by which I mean a sustainable growth rate buoyed by full employment.\n\nWhy do we want governments? We want them because they can do things that improve our welfare that we can\u2019t do individually. In that context, it becomes clear that public policy should be devoted wholly to making sure that there are enough jobs, that poverty is eliminated, that the public health and public education systems are first class, that people who are less well off are able to become better off, etc.\n\nFrom a macroeconomic point of view, the spending and tax decisions of government should be such that total spending in the economy is sufficient to produce the level of real output at which firms will employ the available labor force. This is the goal, and the particular budget outcomes must serve this goal.\n\nNone of this is to say that budget deficits don\u2019t matter at all. The fundamental point that the original developers of MMT would make\u2014myself or Randall Wray or Warren Mosler\u2014 is that the risk of budget deficits is not insolvency but inflation. In saying that, however, we would also stress that inflation is the risk of\u00a0<em style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; \">any</em>\u00a0kind of overspending, whether investment, consumption, export, or government spending. Any component of aggregate demand could push the economy to that point where we get inflation. Excessive government spending is not always to blame.\n\nIn sum, we\u2019re quite categorical that we believe that budget deficits can be excessive and can be deficient as well. Deficits can be too large, just as they can be too small, and the aim of government is to make sure that they\u2019re just right to employ all available productive capacity.\n\n</blockquote>We've been caught in between two false economic theories. It seems obvious to me that MMT is far closer to a description of the actual economic situation, but we're laboring between Keynesian and neoliberal/neoclassical economics (the former being less wrong than the latter, but both are wrong).

The recording is more an experimental thing - which is why I am very happy when people chime in and comment. BUT:\n\nI would start with there is no \"we\". Of course there a bunch of EdgeRyders that use this platform, as it is now, and derive benefit from it. But there is <em>such </em>an overwhelming majority of <em>potential </em>users who cannot use it effectively to get their stuff done! That is what I tried to touch on <a href=\"/t/unmonastery-edgeryders-meet-up-in-london/4259/8\">here </a>and <a href=\"/t/unmonastery-edgeryders-meet-up-in-london/4259/13\">here</a>. Designing a system for privacy and transparency will of course be walking a thin line (very bad idiom in my perspective, as it implies too few dimensions, assumes continuity of the line, and that the line will always be a line - pretty much independent from where you look). My guiding principle is that many of the consequences of an action will strongly affect those working on it (in line with bottom up do-ocracy). If it affects other people it should be in a generally good way. If this is not true they should sit down and reflect some more. If there is some doubt about the distribution of consequences I would want a system that mandates including representatives from groups that are strongly negatively affected (will happen with any project if it is large/impactful enough). These people do not have a veto on all things but they have absolute technical/information oversight and are mandated to balance between the interest of the two groups. They are incentivized mostly by \"their group\". \"Their group\" can decide to withhold their share, and parts of a (larger) share that has to be paid by the audited group, if there is a lack of trust. Thus I hope to achieve an \"empathy for the enemy\" effect in every project.\n\nRe multiple pgp-keys: In effect this is a much sloppier and less individually private approach than one key. It is more 0.67 of a key.\n\nRe \"it is a little harder for [...]\": This is not a triviality for me. My vision of a collaborative platform is one where the investment very, very quickly starts to pay back. And this is the hardest to pull off they first time you have to do it. After that it'll be downhill, and a psychological shift will probably happen on a similar level as wiki vs enc brit*. But if you keep the ingredients from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrhenius_equation#Limitations_of_the_idea_of_Arrhenius_activation_energy\">reacting </a>they can't <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleation\">nucleate</a> into a different \"<a href=\"https://youtu.be/u8AE4aKP2gw?t=76\">phase</a>\" (with different fundamental properties, e.g. approaches to getting stuff done). If the small groups that get together (LOTE) always have to keep overcoming a very large interaction barrier with the rest of the world - they will be slowly absorbed again or usually die out ineffectively. Individual groups are too small to skill-share effectively (not surprising as they are all from the tiny minority of \"text inputters\" sharing one language on this planet) due to small pool size and degree of uniformity.\n\nThey can only get rid of some secondary stresses(<a href=\"/t/completely-unacceptable/4443\">?</a>) incurred through the friction and loss such a barrier produces if they interact with the outside world on its terms - or they produce significantly more groups in their vicinity with whom they can (and <em>do</em>) interact more easily because <a href=\"https://oscedays.org/\">they</a> <a href=\"http://p2pfoundation.net/\">are </a><a href=\"http://ouishare.net/en\">similar</a>. I have my doubts on the state of affairs for the latter point. For me it is pretty clear that if you don't have your hands (sometimes literally) full with work that will make an <em>impact </em>the chances are high that you will <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/927/\">coordinate to death</a> (myself included here**). If for you a text box does not incur a too high <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_cost\">transaction cost</a> in your view, you may have missed going straight into academia ;). They have a collaborative model based on this already for some time.\n\nThe third option is engaging in work that pays off much better than the stuff the outside world is willing or able to engage in. Unfortunately they pretty much picked the low hanging fruit clean (that can be measured in a quarterly report), and now there's only the rotten financial instruments left. Unless you go for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty,_dangerous_and_demeaning\">three Ds</a> of course - but this not the most popular proposition for a do-ocracy. And not the best place for a text box either. That means you gotta do things differently, or be able to measure things differently (however metrics is ultimately a question of authority, and thus more difficult as a first step). And for the reasons stated above, for me, this means inclusiveness. If you rub two sticks together - they sure get warm. But sometimes you got to <a href=\"https://youtu.be/u8AE4aKP2gw?t=617\">push a little harder</a> to get something <em>much </em>more useful out of it. Or in the words of an economist:\n\nA trend is a trend is a trend.\n\nBut the question is, will it bend?\n\nWill it alter its course through some unforeseen force and come to a premature end?\n\n*Extremely profound tectonic shift - but nothing compared to a celebrity breakup!\n\n**In everyone's defense: Of course the most practical thing is a good theory.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-01 17:42:41", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:07.639759", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1002, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [22979], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11925, "user_id": 97, "topic_id": 2704, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Co-operatives</b>\n\nHello Alberto,\n\nI think Edgeryders LBG could probably be considered a co-operative (if it wanted to be)\n\nAs I understand things co-ops can have any kind of legal status, they just need to operate under the co-op principles -\n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-operative_Principles\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-operative_Principles</a>\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-21 03:13:23", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:08.322839", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 70, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [8565], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10193, "user_id": 2600, "topic_id": 4460, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Government accountability</b>\n\nMy hope is like Pukar's, for the youth involvement not to die down.

Harmonious Hackathons: </strong>after prototyping this at Lote4, a bunch of Edgeryders really want to making them happen on a regular basis and making them economically sustainable (ensure people organising them are paid). We would do a number of themes, one of which could be \\#HackCare continuing on <a href=\"/t/notes-from-the-lote4-session-on-the-future-of-care-in-the-hands-of-hackers/3920\">foundation set at lote4</a> by @remy, @ben and everyone who participated. <a href=\"/t/harmonious-hackathon/587\" target=\"_blank\">Interested?</a>\n\n<strong>B. Building an Edgeryders home base</strong>. <span>We also agreed that we need \"our own\" space to run events regularly, as hackathons need weeks rather than days to \"complete\" work. This will make it easier to keep money and time costs at an acceptable level. Email nadia@edgeryders.eu if you</span> want to get involved in this.\n\n<strong>C. Edgeryders.eu/ Makerfox integration:</strong> the experiment with using barter to build \\#lote4 using makerfox produced promising results. In order for us to use it for more activities, the integration with Edgeryders needs to be smoother, so we need to specify what needs to be done and find resources to cover the cost of the work.

It was agreed that the time is not mature for setting up a separate unMonastery organisation and that Edgeryders LBG should continue as \"home organisation\" for the unMonastery project.\n\n<strong>A. Continued presence in Matera:</strong>  We agreed to produce a credible plan for running the unMonastery space including revenue streams/fundraising activities in order to present to the Comitato Matera 2019 before they are dissolved (i.e. end of the working year). For those interested, @mariabyck, @katalin, @nicobis and @ritao are exploring this.\n\n<strong>B. New possible unMonastery sites</strong>: Edgeryders LBG (the company) has been approached with two requests for new development projects which could involve setting up new unMonastery sites. After a session with community members during Lote4 one proposal was sent off to Fabrizio Barca.\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">3.

The question is can we look for lighter event formats and teams to drive them? Proposals ranged from piggybacking existing events and making ourselves visible as \"Edgeryders\"; to making them more harmonious hackathon focused; to doing a walking format (a long trek and people host conversations while walking or during breaks).

In current setup (@Ben do we have records of who and how negotiated it this way?), most residents of unMonastery receive 400 euro from which they need to cover food expenses. Myself of course I just ask to receive pleasing share of food (keeping it vegan) + basic hygiene products and simply stay away from all this financial stipend idea. My apologies here to Ben for making with this exception all the related bureaucracy even more complicated to manage :(\n\nToday during short discussion with @bembo_davies and @mariabyck I've mentioned that I asked @fortyfoxes over SMS if he could let us know if he comes for lunch and how many more people would come with him. I really like eating together with big group of friends, finding sharing meals a big part of creating bounds in community, I also let myself very freely invite people to join us for a meal. Then it got brought to my attention that David doesn't contribute anymore part of his stipend to virtual pool of money from which people in Food Acquisition Team currently purchase pretty much all the food (we still don't have clear strategy for <a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/in-kind-donations-of-food-served-at-unmonastery-nodes\">transitioning to in-kind donations</a>)\n\nBTW I started yesterday working on <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wvfsQdCk-_yIXsqieghRLUb-ttKUAYOE4aBJgwdX69Y\">simple slides</a> visualizing what unMonastery:Matera can offer. Focusing on real world assets like accomodation, food, travel, coworking space etc. also including still strongly present money fiction ;)\n\nAs I can recall, during session in Strasbourg where we started dreaming about unMonastery, we started by taking about grants and monetary funding and then opened conversation for <strong>in-kind</strong> donations and clarifying with ourselves what <strong>real world assets</strong> we need to work on all the great projects we do.\n\nTo my understanding, currently @lois doesn't base her work on any of those physical assets, still receiving humble financial grant and maybe doing some networking with ER community. Now it turns out (please correct me if wrong) that David also doesn't sleep here, doesn't eat here, doesn't work here and just receives similar humble financial grant. As I mentioned in <a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/separation-of-concerns\">Separation of concerns</a> post I find such situation far from my interpretation of unMonastery vision, while still very likely fitting more broad set of concerns addressed by Edgeryders!\n\nI hope to write more well thought elaboration on this topic which will include recommendation to stay cautious with such stipends / micro grants. Besides <strong>obscuring what it really takes</strong> (in terms of real world assets) for unMonasterians to do what they/we do. It also may cause some hostility from local community, I remember @ilariadauria mentioning that some people living around here may consider 400 euro as more than many unMonasterians receiving it would consider.\n\n(image from beautiful meal which we - 16 people - enjoyed sharing yesterday evening)", "created_at": "2014-05-21 08:39:16", "updated_at": "2019-06-22 14:36:50.900631", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 532, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 750, "user_id": 3417, "topic_id": 717, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\u00a0\n\nMy name is Jenny Gkiougki and I am one of those Greeks that went back home <em>during </em>the crisis. (For an account of how I came about this decision and my take on the crisis please follow <a href=\"/en/crisis-what-crisis-the-journey-back-to-my-eco-roots#comment-25934\">this link</a> here on Edgeryders) During my residence abroad I was working as a business consultant and marketer. After ten years, I decided to return to my Greece to contribute to the local community and help with the bringing about of change. I am currently (amongst others) working on a project called \u201cReal Food Utopia\u201d as a co-facilitator with a foreign research partner, dealing with the mapping of alternative food systems in the region of Thessaloniki. (For a full list of all the projects I'm working on currently and the great and exciting things we are creating in Greece and in EU and links to many of them <a href=\"/t/from-eco-activism-to-food-sovereignty-and-beyond/527\">please look here at another of my posts).</a>\n\nThe workshops of the project are related to alternative economies, peri-urban gardening, refugees and food through a participatory procedure between people who belong to informal initiatives all around the city. This procedure also includes training in participatory video making and working on all its processes (ie. storyboards, editing) in order to create audiovisual material and share the technique with everyone who is interested in it.\n\nI am a member of the URGENCI International Network of Community Supported Agriculture, the European Research Group on CSA, and the European Movement for Food Sovereignty. I have been working as an activist on matters related to Food Sovereignty for 5 years and I am currently cooperating with a team of another three more advocates to create a legal entity to represent grassroots initiatives. In the near future, we would like to expand our network through an open call all over Greece and reclaim our existing collaborations and good synergies abroad.\n\nI am interested in self-sustainability and viable solutions with regards to how we live and thrive and hence I beleive that the future lies in the creation of new types of communities, ecovillages etc, and the promotion of practices like permaculture and the blue economy model of zero emissions that can create self-sufficient farmers and viable, circular economies that not only do not pollute, but actually create more resources instead of depleting them.\u00a0 I am trying to encourage Greek people to be more involved in Community-Supported Agriculture (CSA) schemes, to share risks with their farmers during the cultivating season and create a new concept of human relationship within the community they interact with. Additionally, the enhancement of CSA would support small-scale farmers who lack access to the local market and cannot (should not) get involved in complex food chains.\n\nWe would like to address the needs of small-scale farmers who wish to obtain access to European food markets at fair prices, but also consumers of all ages who become more conscious about food production and consumption. I would like to engage in interactive campaigns and seminars that target informal collectivities who are interested in food sovereignty, but lack financial resources and technical support. Our community project will form a new hub that will host them and their projects.\n\nWe are interested in creating a new agricultural production model in Greece, focusing on agroecology and self-sufficiency in the context of land and food management, considering limiting factors such as economic hardship. All in all, we pursue the transition to a new way of thinking and living through an \u201cumbrella\u201d project which consists of several innovative schemes.\n\nThe main scope of the project is to empower rural farmers and inspire rural lifestyle, by combining traditions and technology, based on the principles of permaculture. We wish to enhance small-scale agriculture, in order to revive Greece\u2019s rural areas and promote an economy that is based on social solidarity and alternative currencies.\n\nWhat we have in mind is summarized in the following fields of action:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\tExporting network of agricultural products in Northern Europe (especially citrus, olive oil and \u201cugly\u201d fruits) that are produced by small-scale farmers to solidarity collectivities at fair prices.</li>\n\n<li>\tPromotion of food security and food sovereignty in Greece.</li>\n\n<li>\tRespond to the mainstream challenges by using our ingenuity and creativity for social \u2013nonpersonal- benefits.</li>\n\n<li>\tReduce food waste promoting \u201cugly\u201d fruits and vegetables focusing on good quality.</li>\n\n<li>\tBoost local economies and offer technical support to Community Supported Agriculture schemes.</li>\n\n<li>\tCreation of an official Greek hub for non formal groups working on food sovereignty that lack financial support.</li>\n\n<li>\tSaving of Greek agricultural land from the Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund and ensuring its utilization through concession or purchase by our group in the context of communal ownership.</li>\n\n<li>Increase awareness and educate farmers and consumers in order to become more conscious through seminars, campaigns and training sessions about sustainable farming methods and consumption patterns. Also, we are very interested in local pupils and students who are a significant target group.</li>\n\n</ul>", "created_at": "2016-09-18 18:21:49", "updated_at": "2018-05-24 13:49:34.477298", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 959, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 15.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1961, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1928, "post_number": 1, "raw": "I put together an email for Paolo Verri of Matera to send to his counterpart:\n\n<div>Dear [...]</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>this mail is to invite you to join Matera in a new initiative.

It\u2019s a challenging setting to work in. One has to think that in these communities there is no doctors, hospitals or medical treatment in place. Access to treatment is \u00a0extremely limited (for diabetics as well - many forms are absent, some not always available, most of them too expensive anyway) and families earn 2 dollars per day. Many patients\u2019 diabetes is caused by malnutrition, despite the common conception that it is a rich people\u2019s condition. I often see blind children who lost their sight because their families lacked access to medication or means to purchase them. And all that in India, with the second fastest growth of diabetes in the world, and 70 percent of the population living in rural areas. Which makes it extremely difficult to identify those in need and ensure they\u2019re given help.\n\nFor the past years, I have lived in India - partly in a hospital, without being paid, and I had a chance to see how the system works. As a diabetic myself, I\u2019ve experienced the hardships of managing my own illness and needed to adapt to available solutions.\n\nAs an answer to this challenge, we are building a sustainable, and affordable model that could be replicated in other communities, across India and beyond. The service is based on dozens of patients and caregivers, who are being trained to provide other members of the community with door-to-door assistance. Our Community Health Workers in the pilot area conduct free screenings (sugar level, BMI, pressure monitoring) and check for diabetes and other health problems \u00a0- which they can later address according to the needs of each of the patients. An important component of this work is building relationships between the patients and the leaders - and help to establish links between those in needs and institutions that could provide them with further help. We also provide patients with free medicine. On top of that, we educate, bring awareness and help with early detection of potential issues. Many pre-diabetics in India could avoid becoming ill by changes in their dietary habits - and the diet is large to blame here.\n\nSuch screenings would not only help to support those who suffer from diabetes but extend preventive care and potentially save millions of dollars in treating more complex effects of diabetes, such as dialysis and other complications. Beyond that, we\u2019re helping some of the diabetics to overcome their poverty, as managing their problems costs \u00bc of their income, pushing them to extreme poverty. Providing free treatment and medication is essential for them to improve their quality of life.\n\nOn top of that, we equip our workers with SMS technology that allows them to collect the daily logs and patient's\u2019 history - which will be stored in an open source database available to any researcher in the world. Otherwise, such information about chronically sick citizens of rural India is basically impossible to acquire.\n\nWe plan to transform <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thesucreblue\">Sucre Blue</a> into a model that could be replicated by communities all over the world - with a peer-based approach, designed to deal with chronic diseases. In India, we engage women in our work - mostly those who suffer from diabetes themselves. It is a way to change a bit disproportionate representation of men in healthcare - and it empowers women in the society. \u00a0Having their personal approach to diabetes allows us to change the opinion around the disease, often perceived as a curse, for example forbidding some of the ill to get married.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-20 05:47:59", "updated_at": "2018-05-24 13:59:00.081140", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 656, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 6.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11739, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2243, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Public!</b>\n\nShare away. :-)\n\n", "created_at": "2013-12-02 23:03:15", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:07.435723", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 7, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 1.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [9493], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10919, "user_id": 2060, "topic_id": 2728, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<h3>What is Design Thinking?</h3>\n\n<span>Design Thinking is a process for creating new designs and solving problems that in addition to normal scientific techniques borrows a lot from the techniques used by artists to create their works.

The computer mouse itself was created using the design thinking process by Apple. Apple used and still uses design thinking extensively and has helped popularize it.\n\nDesign thinking later developed to be used beyond product design. It started to be used in total user experience design such as designing a new museum.\n\nThe third stage of development for design thinking widened its scope even further making it used for effecting change in communities! By making gradual small interventions at the correct places whole communities can be changed!

One will present you with all the possibilities, the other says, \"right we shall go here, passing through here, here and here\".\n\nFor information gathering I feel wiki as still being mostly unsurpassed. Even with all their shortcomings when trying to integrate information among people coming from very different experiences.\n\nSpeaking about the discussion tool itself, the problem is that we have different principles, and it is not possible to honor them all at the same time. We also have some unspoken assumptions, and some problems.\n\nAmong the unspoken assumptions I see:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>There more (and often better) ideas in the wider community.</li>\n\n<li>if we integrate different ideas the result will generally have a wider support.</li>\n\n</ol>Among the problems the biggest is that <em>many topics are too complex for most people to participate in</em>. Although most people are experts in something, no one is expert is everything. So if we want to create a system that permit to anyone to participate, will this not exclude the people who do not understand the issue? Or who understand in general the issue, but are not technically advanced enough to participate in the discussion?\n\nThis is a serious question, and the answer to this question defines the type of system you will have.\n\nThis have several connected issues: (1) if only some people can, meaningfully, participate in a discussion would this not impoverish it? (2) Would the result still be representative of the will of the majority of the people if only the people who are able to understand it participate in it?\u00a0\n\nLiquid feedback position is that it is important that everybody participates. So when they have not the technical knowledge to do it they are to chose a person to represent them. But the representation is not limitless. In any moment they can change their mind and ask someone else to represent for them from now on.\n\nThe positive element of this is obviously the fact that everybody can participate.\n\nThere are many problems though.\n\n1) if people vote for a person, people with charisma will have a high chance of reaching the end. Actors, singers, (accordion ;-) ) musicians, comedians, anyone with a wide public profile will be favorited at this game.\n\n2) people can ask a person to make changes to his proposal. But if he does not want to do it, they can only start a new proposal. Having to start from zero to gather votes. (I just discovered this recently). In short a proposal is in some sense owned by the persone who starts it. It strike me as ironic that this is the piraten party system ;-).\n\n3) although people can delegate their power, and recover it in any moment, many people will probably not do it. (we) People tend to be quite lazy, especially on topics that fall out of our direct area of interest or expertise. So until a person does something really bad, he might still have the support from a lot of people who are just too uninterested to bother to look for a better candidate.\n\nBut what are the alternatives?\n\nThere are many possible alternatives. Let me list some:\n\n1) ignore the problem (so let only the people who the topic participate) at the early stage where people write and integrate all the possible ideas. Then once a final set of ideas are presented that cannot be further integrated are defined, everybody should vote on them (using voting theory, Shulz system like PP is ok, but others are also possible). Although the people might not be able to understand that inner workings of each of them, it is possible to add to each idea a small video presentation that explains it in a non technical language. If we accept that the vote of the people who do not understand is given out of personal favoritism for the person, and not out of technical analysis, we might consider it just as a form of noise in the system.\n\n2) [and this one is my favorite] use internet to educate the public, while explaining them the ideas. There will still be people who are not interested to participate in the discussion, but maybe it is possible to permit to all those who are willing to do a little effort to participate.\n\nBy asking people not just to rate how much they like an idea, but also to rate how much do they understand it, we can gather important data that can then be automatically used by the system. Here is how: ( I <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_odnkfaH5c&amp;list=PLD0458626DE65DD93&amp;index=4&amp;feature=plpp_video\">presented</a> this idea -developed with Cyril Velikanov- at the ePart 2011 conference).\n\nWith this information would then be possible not just to see the most supported ideas, but also the clearer ones. Not only but it will also be possible to see who are the people able to write in a more comprehensive way something. With the possibility for the system to ask them to rewrite an idea making it easier to understand for the others. Alberto, you remember how in Vilfredo the system is able to find out which proposal you should work on to better help the convergence process? Well here the system could do something similar, albeit simpler. Just asking people to rewrite the best ideas (to fully understand this idea, please see the video above). At the end the final ideas would could (and should) still be evaluated using a general closed voting procedure. But the participation on the planning stage would have been much wider without requesting any representation procedure. Also as people participate in the process they would become more and more aware of the different issues of their society. Not a bad side effect.\n\nThis idea was part of a more general system that was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abbg08ITkyE&amp;feature=BFa&amp;list=PLD0458626DE65DD93\">presented last year</a>.\u00a0\n\nSo, in brief, what I think of liquid democracy? It is surely a step in the right direction. But I think it is really not using the internet at its best. We can do much much better. And I am afraid if the tool raises too fast we might find out the problems once it is too late. What we need is that those tools should be used, and tested online by many communities.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-11 16:21:38", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:03.650682", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1191, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12431, "user_id": 1935, "topic_id": 2973, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>will let u know</b>\n\nthnx\n\nwill ask the embassy and if so I will ask for it\n\n", "created_at": "2014-05-14 16:11:34", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:10.911688", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 22, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [11251], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18244, "user_id": 87, "topic_id": 1281, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>What steps would you recommend others follow?</b>\n\nAlberto,\n\nYou hit upon a real need with SOD, one that was ahead of it's time for the government of Italy, would you recommend that people in other countries replicate this until their countries release open data?\n\nWhat process should they follow to get their hands on this data?\n\nI have the perfect locatoin for them to store, and share, the data from, so the only challenge would be providing a roadmap and encouraging others to follow.\n\nThoughts?\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-28 13:01:07", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:41.930626", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 98, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12190, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 5030, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>well done btw :))</b>\n\nOne step down, only 3 more to go :))))\n\n", "created_at": "2015-12-03 11:14:48", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:09.674642", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 15, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [10702], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20162, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 5246, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Inside the Battle to define mental illness</b>\n\n<span>A couple of years ago I came across an in depth article which lays bare some troubling answers to your questions in the domain of psychiatry.

The \"settings\" on the control systems can allow for more or less dynamic variability depending on the affected environment. Perhaps there should also be space for a \"cell wall\" compartmentalization feature, e.g. interfacing with a corrosive or corrupting influence, although I am not sure this needs to be planned in detail beforehand.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-08-24 10:43:10", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:43.606696", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 336, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [17944], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27865, "user_id": 2201, "topic_id": 4440, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Inshallah :-)</b>\n\nWill do my best!\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-23 12:40:12", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:33.685369", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 10, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1170, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 1137, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Just in after an aggravating hour at the \"<a href=\"http://eyif.wordpress.com/2013/06/12/the-unconvention-2013-rocked/\">unConvention</a>\", an event organised by the European Young Innovators Forum and by the looks of it, sponsored by Microsoft. MEP Sean Kelly opened the session with a question. He asked how policymakers can encourage people to \"be more innovative\". In<a href=\"/t/on-the-ties-between-participation-innovation-and-occupation/1011\"> this post</a> I raised the point that it seems our societies are becoming less tolerant of our young innovators like Pirate Bay spokesperson and Flattr co-founder Peter Sunde and the now deceased Aaron Swartz, founder of reddit, not more.\n\nThe session I attended left me with the impression that the rift between how institutional actors and innovators understand and envision change is growing. We see that young people everywhere tend to reject institutional politics: traditional mobilization in the form of voting or party membership is increasingly unpopular and questions the meaning of representative democracy. Eight out of ten Europeans under thirty years of age state to have participated in an election in the last three years. We know, however, that as long as voting continues to be well looked upon socially,surveys overestimate participation. Only five percent is active in a political party or organization. By comparison, three times more young people are involved with an organization promoting human rights or local/global community development. However those who would claim this is due to young people being disengaged or aparthetic would have a hard time explaining the massive mobilisation against\u00a0\u00a0 ACTA and austerity-ideology based policies last year.\n\nSo what does the drop of membership and participation in formal political processes have to do with innovation and why should policymakers tasked with encouraging innovation care about this? I think the Edgeryders experience from the past year and a half has taught us a few things worth sharing.\n\nFor those who have never heard about it, Edgeryders is a network that developed under the umbrella of a joint Council of Europe-European Commission research project. Launched in 2011, the project aimed at having young (mostly under 25) Europeans take part in a collaborative policy process, acting as \u201ccitizen experts\u201d and advisors to European policy makers. The project terminated in late 2012 with the publication of a high-impact, citizen-driven policy document. The project was such an empowering experience that some of its protagonists decided to spin it off into a social enterprise, also called Edgeryders, whose management team includes some of the most active members of the community.\n\n<h3 style=\"color:Blue;\">Empowerment from connectivity in the Edgeryders experience</h3>\n\nEdgeryders was created as a vehicle to write a policy document, and it connected people with a view to that goal. However, once connected to each other, its participants started very actively using Edgeryders for purposes not intended by the Council of Europe and the European Commission (though welcomed by them):\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\tpersonal development and extending networks. \u00a0</li>\n\n<li>\tprofessional development and launching business, usually microbusiness. Interestingly \u2013 although Edgeryders was not a social innovation initiative, the community contributed seven entries to the firts European Social Innovation Competition (1% of the total number of entries across the whole continent!), including one of the winners.</li>\n\n<li>\tpolitical participation, typically outside the party politics space. One such initiative is <a href=\"http://www.edgeryders.eu/democracy-camp-europe\">Democracy Camp Europe</a>, a two-day hackathon in the European Parliament building for citizens to build tools to improve the perception of the Europe-wide political interderdependencies with a view to improving the quality of citizen participation in the upcoming European elections 2014. In building this, the community could tap into the wisdom of individual edgeryders who are active in various innovative political spaces, like the Indignant, anti-Acta and open data amovements; or who have participated in cutting-edge institutional processes, like the Icelandic crowdsourced constitution.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nIt is important to note that these three spheres blur into each other. The initiatives being launched by the Edgeryders community, even when they take the form of a business, tend to be driven by the community\u2019s values. Businesses, too, are sometimes perceived as a vehicle for enacting social change. An example: Matthias Ansorg, a German edgeryder has created a startup around a <a href=\"/t/matthiass-economy-app-wins-the-european-social-innovation-award/1130\">smartphone app that enables multi-party bartering</a>, intended to restart a local economy hit by credit crunches and liquidity constraints. He speakes the language of tech startups, but the company\u2019s goals are clearly social.\n\nSocial innovation and direct improvements of living conditions enable new forms of democratic participation and political relations to emerge. It is therefor hardly surprising that the rise in social innovation seems to coincide with both a drop of membership and participation in structured political processes and organisations as well as a rise in protest movements. They are the citizenry\u2019s response to deep structural and ideological ruptures between how political institutions and new generations envision change. \u00a0The more institutions are receptive to this, the better for everyone. Because it builds in activists a story of \u201cwe can do this together\u201d. And government can channel intellectual support in solving hard problems. If, however, institutions fail to read these changes or resist them, is is unlikely young people will simply go back to using traditional participation channels. It is much more likely that they will defect to hacking society directly or just exit.\n\nIn order to facilitate the work of shaping the collective future in a more sustainable direction, bottom up, we have to build our own support systems, as the existing power structures are failing to generate credible responses to the trio of crises threatening our future. The reason being that we can't really use the ones that are there.\n\nThere has never been a better time to work together, peer to peer.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-06-06 16:31:03", "updated_at": "2017-10-03 10:55:37.500901", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1040, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 70.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3791], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16553, "user_id": 14, "topic_id": 2402, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Access Denied?</b>\n\nI'd be interested to see this document but I'm getting \"Access Denied\".

I'm really really curious about what you mean for \"local social network\". I'll leave here my email so you can reply directly: higiacomo[at]gmail.com</strong>)\n\n<h3>MY 2 CENTS</h3>I've been following the cohousing topic in the past 2 years and for the fellow italian edgeryders that are interested I can\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.amazon.it/gp/product/8888819177/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=giacomoneri-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=3370&amp;creative=24114&amp;creativeASIN=8888819177\">refer a book+documentary</a>\u00a0which features a brief history and the current (partial) picture of the european cohousing movement.\u00a0\n\nSo here in brief my experience with three coworking that are starting the construction phase these months and that I've been following either personally or professionaly. (Numbers may be slightly inaccurate..memory faults :)\n\n<h3>1.Ferrara</h3>After more than 2 years of adventures they ended up with an over-sized project but decided to continue.\n\nThey're 5 families and the land/design is for 12. During the construction phase they'll look for the other 7 but in the end the builder (who is acting like a bank, financially speaking) will sell to anyone.\n\n<h3>2.BOLOGNA</h3>Here there has been a deal between the local municipality and the group of families. They basically got the city land for a very discounted price and in exchange they'll provide neighbour-wide services.\u00a0\n\n<h3>3.TREVISO</h3>Here there's been a financially strong local cooperative that promoted all the project. After a year long process the group signed the contract after some last-minute drop-out that really mined the success of the investment.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<h3>TOO LONG TO READ:</h3>So here are the lessons for me:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>starting a cohousing is terrible hard because a lots of money is involved</strong></li>\n\n<li>the<strong>\u00a0traditional real estate process is reversed</strong>: therefore it's a real nightmare for the builders/promoters that loose their power and sometimes even their margins. In other words the wanna-be cohousers must start by themselves and take the organizational risk/investment</li>\n\n<li>But still. Wanna-be cohousers need the assistance of qualified professionals. (facilitators, architects and more). If they do by themselves they usually end up with\u00a0<strong>in-the-sky</strong>\u00a0expectations and when they found out the true number they have to start over or more probably: give up</li>\n\n<li><strong>even if all those factors line up</strong>: still we're talking of<strong>\u00a0yearly long processes</strong>. This usually means that people's life/work can change, so their mind, and the group cohesion/investment is always mined at the core</li>\n\n</ul><strong>In other words: it's a real venture... but I bet it's worth it.</strong>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<h3>A COHOUSING STARTING KIT</h3>In the past months I've been collaborating with a design studio who's trying to specialize in this kind of processes. I helped them to put together a cohousing starting kit and it should be ready in march. I'll be happy to follow up if any edgeryder is interested.\n\nBut to be honest the kit is just informative / promotional. I would be very interested in exploring more creative and strategic ways to work around the obstacles I mentioned.\n\nFor example: <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/who-ryder-what-edge/mission_case/permanent-collective-leipzig\">re-using </a>is for sure a great choice for many reasons. Also renting and in general mixed business models are potential ways to overcome the financial obstacle. I'm sure there's lot of room for improvements!\u00a0\n\nOkay.

Problem is... he does not speak english: so we were thinking of a couple of written questions in English, and then a direct talk via Skype.\u00a0\n\nThis is the email I sent him (in Italian), putting Nadia and Ben in copy:\u00a0\n\nTi ringrazio nuovamente del tuo interessamento per l'unMonastery e l'evento Living On The Edge della rete degli Edgeryders. Come d'accordo, aggiungo a questa email Nadia El-Imam (CEO di Edgeryders, impresa sociale) e Ben Vickers (mente dell'unMonastery, nonch\u00e9 futuro unAbbott del non-monastero). L'unMonastery, progetto pilote della candidatura di Matera a Capitale europea della Cultura nel 2019, \u00e8 un nuovo tipo di spazio sociale che accoglie hackers, artisti, designers, ecc. per sperimentare nuove forme di commistione tra vita e lavoro, a servizio di una comunit\u00e0 locale. In questo caso, la citt\u00e0 di Matera \u00e8 stata la prima a rispondere all'appello, offrendo il Palazzo del Casale, nei Sassi. L'unMonastery puo essere visto sia come una tipologia di residenze per innovatori radicali che prototipano nuove soluzioni a problemi locali (qui trovi la lista delle criticit\u00e0 materane emerse durante uno dei workshop partecipati fatti con la citt\u00e0), sia come il tentativo di creare un nuovo tipo di istituzione. Ci sono 3 dimensioni: outreach / internal / interface. Forse Nadia ti potrebbe parlare dell'outreach, facendo un collegamento con la rete degli Edgeryders, mentre Ben potrebbe parlarti della dimensione interna, e io sarei ben felice di parlarti dell'interfaccia con la comunit\u00e0 locale. Un altro approccio sarebbe quello di affrontare l'unMonastery partendo dalle tematiche: precariato, impegno e impatto sociale, resilienza di comunit\u00e0. E importante capire che tutto cio che \u00e8 stato fatto sull'unMonastery, \u00e8 stato elaborato online, tramite la rete degli Edgeryders: qui troverai i diversi post e commenti vari fati sul tema. So che non ce la farai ad essere a Matera durante l'evento Living On The Edge, ma ti mando comunque il programma in Italiano: una delle tre sessioni \u00e8 dedicata interamente al making-of del non-monastero. Nadia parla sia inglese che italiano. Ben parla solo inglese. Io sono a disposizione per l'italiano. Per qualsiasi cosa non esitare a contattarci. Spero di vederti a Matera, in ogni caso rimaniamo in contatto telefonicamente.\u00a0\n\nBasically I proposed to approach the unMonastery either through outreach / interface / internal, or through the themes (cowork and coliving, resilience, ecc.).\u00a0\n\nAlso, he saw the press pack but was wondering if there were \"new\" photos pof the place. He is going to Puglia next week and will see if he can manage to stop by in Matera Monday or Tuesday: I told him I would be there, but I don't know if the site will be available for pics!\u00a0\n\nWaiting for your feedback!

There is a bit of editing to do, because section 1.3.6 (the one curated by @Lakomaa ) does not follow that format. I will not do it, simply move Erik's text below my own (and Marco's, who did follow the table's scheme).\n\nI will rearrange section 1.3 as follows. Section 1.3.1, 1.3.3 and 1.3.5 (state of the art) will be regrouped under just one header. This will encode changes in the state of the art as pertain to the project, across the disciplines we follow. A completely new section (\"Impact\") will contain <em>my own</em> take on where I see the most important impact of opencare. Others are welcome to add their own.\u00a0\n\nOne note about style. I recommend it dry. Short sentences. As few clauses and\u00a0adverbs as possible. Active form rather than passive form. Bullet points and tables are good \u2013 we used them a lot in the proposal, with good results.\u00a0Let's make it easy to read.\u00a0\n\nOne note about state of the art.\u00a0Just like the proposal, Section 1.3 is divided into two sub-sections: \"state of the art\" and \"own contribution\".\n\nState of the art is the state of the art\u00a0<em>outside</em>\u00a0the project. We described it in the proposal. Any deviation is attributable to major breakthroughs made\u00a0<em>outside</em>\u00a0the project (\"we now have experimental evidence for Higg's boson\"). I am not aware of anything major in our branch of collective intelligence/network science since the project started. Nothing, anyway, that justifies a deviation from our workprogramme (for example, the release of a full-fledged, theoretically grounded open source ethnographic software making use of graph theory).\u00a0Therefore, I do not feel awkward at all to write \"no major breakthrough here\". That said, you are the better network science scholar, so your perception of the field trumps mine. Feel free to add or rewrite.\u00a0\n\nOwn contribution is where we are supposed to deliver. Here, obviously, it would be unacceptable to write we have done nothing. Fortunately, we have done quite a lot of work, so no need to beat about the bush.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-02-18 11:54:02", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:06.656599", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 488, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [9038], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13820, "user_id": 3025, "topic_id": 5222, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>drowning too ...</b>\n\n*sigh* And see, how good I am at staying away from the forum in order to get some rest? ;) Damn!!\n\nWednesday at 10 sounds good for me!

A teacher over cultural divisions, over social divisions, over economical divisions, over whatever divisions. Why it matters, and what teacher has to do with the development in Global South. Why is it then a problem that we know so much about Global South?\n\n\u00a0\n\n<i><b>The workshop by Piotr Dzialak on \u201cThe pedagogy of development in the Global South\u201d presented a new way of teaching and more specifically thinking about the Global South.</b></i>\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe worskhop introduced the participants to the BA in teaching at the Necessary Teacher Training College, DNS Tvind International School Center, Denmark, in cooperation with One World University. The main objective of this Bachelor is to give future teachers the experience of living in the real world. That world is their classroom and they are learning by doing. This is believed to be very important for future teachers, who will then talk about their own experiences to their students and as such be able to speak from the heart. The program consists of three years, each focusing on a particular practice field: year 1 at international level, year 2 at European level and year 3 at school level. To name but a few activities that are passing the review during the teaching program are a study travel to Africa, attending peace conference, activities related to climate change, ecological garden farming, teaching practice.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFollowing the presentation of the program, the participants looked more critical to their own education, and particularly were asked to be critical about the shortcomings in the existing educational system in Europe. Some gaps that were brought forward by participants are:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>\t\tAbility to think critically</li>\n\n<li>\t\tCommunication skills</li>\n\n<li>\t\tRelationship management</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nIn general, it was said that the existing educational system is extremely result oriented, looking at the perspective of knowledge acquisition with very limited attention/room for gaining social skills and attitudes build up through life-learning experiences.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe program at Tvind starts from a new approach, where everybody can teach others. And teachers in the program are ordinary people, talking from their own experience and background, sharing their own expertise. The role of the teacher shifts from knowledge transfer to connecting and coordinating information sharing between the people and the pupils.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn this regard, six common failures of current educational programs, that deliver school teachers, were presented:\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n\n<colgroup>\n\n<col width=\"48*\">\n\n<col width=\"208*\">\n\n</colgroup>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n\n<td style=\"width: 19%;\">\n\nF# 1: Not knowing the world\n\n</td>\n\n<td style=\"width: 81%;\">\n\nTo address this shortcoming, teacher students are encouraged to go to the world and see it, experience it and personalize those experiences, bringing them back close to home. After attending the program, teacher students know what they are talking about as they have lived it themselves.\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n\n<td style=\"width: 19%;\">\n\nF# 2: Not knowing the audience (home)\n\n</td>\n\n<td style=\"width: 81%;\">\n\nOften, teachers have very little knowledge of what the lives of their pupils look like, although this is crucial to being able to understand and connect with the pupils.\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n\n<td style=\"width: 19%;\">\n\nF# 3: Theory without practice\n\n</td>\n\n<td style=\"width: 81%;\">\n\nSpeaks for itself.\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n\n<td style=\"width: 19%;\">\n\nF# 4: Academic tyranny\n\n</td>\n\n<td style=\"width: 81%;\">\n\nCurrently, main focus is on knowledge from books, and ancient researchers/inventors, and only few sports and arts, as well as limited participation in school management from pupils, as compared to the new approach where the management is running the school together with the pupils.\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n\n<td style=\"width: 19%;\">\n\nF# 5: Alienation in our society\n\n</td>\n\n<td style=\"width: 81%;\">\n\nThere is an increasing voice for \u201cME ME ME\u201d, forgetting about the focus on the group. This needs to be addressed by accepting others are different, respecting others as they are and prioritizing what is important rather than holding on to protectionist believes resulting in contrast between US and THEM as compared to WE.\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n\u00a0\n\nTo conclude, the workshop finished with some common prejudices, to see where this group of participants stands and as such identify some failures in development, and gaps in our knowledge on the South. The statements can be found in the presentation from Piotr. You can find the questions in the comment below (by Dzialak)\n\n\u00a0\n\nAll in all, views of participants are quite moderate and varicolored and the need to break down GENERAL prejudices to specific contexts was made clear and obvious by all and to all participants.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDespite the valuable skills and attitudes that are taught in this bachelor, it is not recognized within Bologna system, which is considered to be the last and final fuck-up, F# X, as the world needs teachers who actively get involved in the world they live in and tackle issues like alienation, global warming and community problems.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBringing us to the jobs students do once they have finished their bachelor program. Most of them end up being teachers, seen as providing eduction to children aged 0 to 9 years old, similar to principal education. But others get involved in other jobs, such as developmental project management in Global South, working with the youngesters with special needs, managers of NGO's working on Climate Change, Peace and other big issues...\n\nThe teacher training college works in cooperation with programs training development instructors - working in the Global South - based on the same pedagogical principals.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe program originates from a failure of the teaching system that was observed in 1968, regarding discipline in the classroom. A group of young teachers got on bus and traveled the world, especially to Asia, where they met among many ovmnipresent poverty and unjustice - something not known to the Europeans living in a big comfort. From this journey, they wrote investigative guidelines that founded the basis for this new type of educational approach.\n\nAnd the bottom-line is: \u201cgo it, be it, live it, tell it (the story)\u201d ;)\n\n\u00a0\n\nI had a good afternoon and enjoyed getting to know unfamiliar faces.

This means that we enable our community to develop solutions rooted in people's needs and lifestyles. We've created a set of design values that bring out the best of the Op3nCare community, methods that guide our collaborative process, and actions that drive the innovative process forward.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">1.

Exhibition and Summit</h3>\n\n<strong>Outreach and exchange of experiences: </strong>It all starts with an invitation for you and others around the world to share personal experiences, observations and examples on the challenge topic. You will share stories of individuals and groups who are building alternative alternatives to existing health-or social care, as well as of others whose attempts were frustrated. The purpose of this is to build a shared repository of stories, each one embedding strategies for improving health- and social care. Some will resonate more than others with participants, and that will signal to the community that a grain of truth has been found. Collectively, we will build knowledge about new approaches towards health- and social care.\u00a0\n\n<strong>Collaborative sense making:</strong> Once the the goals of Op3nCarers, a range of possible strategies towards them and the obstacles in the way are reasonably clear, the project enters a new phase of (wiki-style) collaborative writing of the Op3nCare fund mission and guidelines. This phase links Op3nCare stories to the social, economic, political and legal context in which they happen: were they enabled by something in particular? Were they hindered by it? What change in could have made the alternative happen, or happen more successfully? By asking and tentatively answering these kinds of question, participants in the process will build shared knowledge and goals. This strategy ensures that both are firmly grounded in real-life, first-person experiences.\n\n<strong>Project Narrative and calls to action: </strong>We collaboratively synthesise the results of our sense making into a narrative structure for Op3nCare, that is going to set the scene for our interactions with one another. This includes co-designing a fair social contract and ethical guidelines for members. It also includes defining role structures (for example: participants can register as \u201ctrailblazers\u201d sharing stories or \u201cmentors\u201d that help making sense of it), motivational engines (for example: badges, karma points or other forms of recognition for active users), strategic partnerships, style and aesthetics.\n\n<strong>Prototyping and testing: </strong>t.b.d\n\n<strong>Prizes: </strong>t.b.d\n\n<strong>Exhibition and Summit: \\#lote 6 takes place in September 2017, in Milan.</strong>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\"><em>Subscribe to the Op3nCare <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/bNlau5\">newsletter</a> for updates coming soon.

A bunch of us showed up: Petru, myself, @OanaT, @Alex_Stef, <a href=\"/u/ana_ungurianu\">@Ana_Ungurianu</a>, <a href=\"/u/cristinas\">@Cristinas</a>\u00a0and a friend of hers (maybe Cristina, you can invite him to join us on the platform?). The photo above is of the space we visited made entirely our of recycled materials and pallets, called Intrarea violoncelului, by folks at reciclarecreativa.ro. Great space!\n\nPutting a face to user profiles we had seen online was not hard (some of us instantly recognised each other!) but we've seen how dynamics change when going offline. We had a chance to chat about the purpose of Spot the Future as an opportunity to join resources to support members' initiatives already under way. Here would be the steps to follow during the next week:\n\n1. Summarize the main questions raised so far by community members in Spot the Future and see where the overlaps are.\u00a0\n\n2. Create a simple visualization of initiatives mentioned to see where we connect with each other in experience, fields of activity and outer networks.\n\n3. Come up with a theme or key question for the workshop in July that we want to answer together in the runup to the event and during the two days when we take action.\u00a0\n\n4. Set the date for the workshop. Cristina and Oana advised to host it during the week, preferably on a Thursday &amp; Friday. How does everyone feel about 2nd-3rd of July? Or 9-10?\u00a0\n\nMe and Alex Stef are taking responsibility for the points above, as<strong>\u00a0</strong>Alex is the new community connector following the Open call we launched 2 weeks ago; but I'll let her introduce herself properly in a different post. I am very thankful to the incredible honest accounts of living and working in Bucharest that came in, and looking forward to work with you all!\n\nWe need all the help we can get.. It starts by letting others here know: What is it that you would like to see the workshop achieving? What should we do together to increase the impact of everyone's work? Example by <a href=\"/u/razvanzamfira\">@RazvanZamfira</a>:\u00a0<em>bring together all of these grassroots initiatives not in a classic conference room or indoor space but in a public space of the city which is in many ways closer to their working environment and more open to outsiders wanting to get to know more about what's happening in their cities and maybe getting involved (<a href=\"/t/mapping-the-grassroots-that-not-many-believe-we-have/4407/3\">source</a>)</em>\n\n<strong>Call to action: Would you be up for a collaborative video-making session where we, together, launch an invitation to the rest of the world to join us? </strong> We could even do it in the beautiful garden where we were yesterday, will check with Georgiana Cremene from the team there. I would aim for next Thursday, what do you think?\n\nWe got an invitation from Cristina's friend to host weekly workshop design meetups in a newly to-be-opened space near Piata Unirii (anyone got address?) - an incubator for projects aiming to achieve sustainability and helped by people with experience in very specific areas - from social entrepreneurship consultants, accounting, marketing etc. It's called NGO HUB.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-24 10:54:52", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:25.155389", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 645, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 1856, 1935], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10028, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 1016, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Yes, seems realistic</b>\n\n(Found this a bit late ... commenting anyway.)\n\nSeems like a nice, and above all, realistic proposal for the future of the Edgeryders group to me.

It might not create the big buzz that we experienced around the LOTE1 conference, but that does not have to be a bad thing. Slower growth around projects could be more sustainable.\n\nI'll host at least <a href=\"/economy-app\">one of my projects</a> on this platform, and I guess when really starting to collaboratively work on that here, I will realize what collaborative tools are missing the most here still.

Perhaps the digital simply helps to organise something which is then a \u201clive\u201d experience. There\u2019s a long history of formal conversations as playing a vital part in processing atrocities - I will not write another long mail of examples! - but it made me wonder if that kind of designed experience (sharing experience, care, validation, human dignity) can be made into a more generic invitation. \u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s something in the idea about spending distinct and limited periods of time in group processes around emotional processing and communication. Feels like that is useful to all as you say - an often over-looked necessary act of hygiene perhaps. Particularly important for those trying to work and live in different ways - living on the edge takes some real practical and emotional resilience, as edgeryders articulates so well.\n\nWhen it comes to practical implementation, I\u2019m setting up an experiment in Brighton for September around place and sharing experience &amp; looking out for volunteer opportunities in psychotherapy group work. Just starting up a collab working with the Uni of Geneva Center for Affective Sciences on touch and emotions - though that\u2019s not focussing on emotion processing from a cultural perspective, which is what grabbed me about the initiative above.\n\nA slow burner - personally, I need to gain some more active experience to be really useful on this - and very happy to follow this discussion &amp; input if relevant.\u00a0\n\n&amp; the Nepal connection\u2026 Worked on a small project in Liverpool after the Nepal earthquake, a Nepalese hornbill audio sculpture that explored how network technology could make audible the word on the street &amp; the dreams people were having\u00a0<a href=\"http://byzantium.chroma.space/about/\">http://byzantium.chroma.space/about/</a>\u00a0 Was designed to be developed for Nepal, but it was vandalised so back to the drawing board with it\u2026 hope it will come through in time. Simple experience gained in the process of making the\u00a0work around the dramatic power of shared expression for processing trauma &amp; that network tech makes possible new ways of facilitating this. All sorts of problems around crowd sourcing psychotherapy -\u00a0equal relations and shared experience feels like a stronger emphasis: designing systems for\u00a0\"live\", sincere, courageous conversations which puts some trust back in the (extended) neighbourhood as equipped\u00a0to hold together around\u00a0the varieties of experiences endured on this earth.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-05-21 01:20:40", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:43.680456", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 453, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [18068], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6921, "user_id": 13, "topic_id": 1033, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>If I understand 'social enterprise' correctly,</b>\n\nit goes like this: \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_enterprise\" target=\"_blank\">an organisation</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_enterprise\" target=\"_blank\"> that applies commercial strategies to maximize improvements in human and environmental well-being</a>\".

[metaphore off]\n\nThe good example of social entrprise approach is what <a href=\"/t/professional-feedback-for-precarious-entrepreneurs/1030/3\" target=\"_blank\">James phrased</a> so well: if your community needs steelworks and you have no money for steelworks, adjust. Run a community clothing bank instead. Be pragmatic. Show must go on. The fact that the community REALLY needs steelworks simply fades into a woodwork. Personally, I ceased to be that pragmatic. The world (or system, if you prefer) is ingenious in setting circumstances up to make us behave (according to it's rules) and our socially conditioned minds are relentless in finding rationalisations why we should conform. BUT I BELIEVE Edgeryders were meant to change the world - not to be changed by it.\n\nIn his almost iconical \"<a href=\"/t/edgeryders-should-we-morph-into-a-social-enterprise/1033\" target=\"_blank\">The Fifth Paragraph</a>\", Alberto listed a set of advantages he sees in changing Edgeryders into an Edgeprise. These are advantages, I agree. But they are by no means unique to the business entity form. Every foundation or association can provide:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><em>Linking point between freestyle activists and policy makers</em> (provided both sides want to be linked).</li>\n\n<li><em>A revenue stream</em>. I do not know formal nuances for the rest of EU, but in Poland foundations and registered associations are allowed to run<strong> business activity, as a side one</strong>, to support their statutory objectives. Apart from that - a non-business entity has several additional funding sources available, like donations and wills.</li>\n\n<li><em>Paid work or even some jobs.</em> To whom it may concern (not me :-) ) - it's just the same with the foundation &amp; association.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nTo cut the long rant brief, I think we may have most of advantages, with the least of disadvantages, if we decide to form (I stick with Polish legal framework, why not) a registered association, being internally structured as a cooperative, with strongly defined statutory goals and the charter allowing business activity to support them.\n\nFor those, who like doing business, it would give a lot of playground - and the important role to play in the whole community. For those who prefer Edgeryders as they are now - the non-business activity will stay unharmed, even reinforced.\n\nAnd as long the direct democracy, in the form of cooperative, will be maintained, I do not expect any major trouble with the community spirit.\n\nAs a last thing - some of you may be aware of the situation of Couchsurfing after they decided to go commercial - how many people, often long-time dedicated members, decided to leave and join totally freestyle Bewelcome, just because of this.\n\nWe do not wont that for Edgeryders, I hope.\n\nL'esprit d'escalier: If you want to see an organisation I would like us to be inspired of, see <a href=\"http://www.seashepherd.org/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.seashepherd.org/</a>\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-03-26 13:17:37", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:38.971598", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 779, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 7.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 479, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 446, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<strong>UPDATE The program of Living On The Edge is built for participants, by participants</strong>.

I agree with you on several key points: that we did well, very well, at \\#LOTE and \\#Egdecamp. That it was not enough, and how could it be? That we are going to get better at this, because it is important we do - and, I would add, because we now have much better ways to connect individual brains into higher-level collective intelligence. (A number of other key points are quite personal, and I neither agree nor disagree, they make sense - I imagine - in the context of your personal trajectory, of which I don't know much.)\u00a0\n\nLike you, I am convinced of the need to perfect the offline meeting format, of which \\#LOTE/#Edgecamp was the alpha version. I completely agree with you that prior online socializing is key to make a good offline meeting, and I would add the latter should be used sparingly (the people that performed least well at both conferences where the people who had not been full participants of this platform - no coincidence). I know I will be working on that, and perhaps we will walk some of this path together. I am also intrigued by the idea that meetings like \\#LOTE should have a pot of resources to allocate, though there are serious problems of adverse selection with that: knowing that there is money to be allocated attracts a rather different kind of crowd than we had in Strasbourg.\u00a0\n\nThere is one significant point of departure between your thinking and mine, though: I don't think that anybody can do something that will be enough by thinking it through and redesigning the process. I think that these processes redesign themselves as they alter the perception and the course of those involved, and their snowballing consequences tend to be greater than you would have thought. I can see this happen already, in the Council of Europe and outside. Trouble with this emergent positive feedback dynamics stuff, you can never be quite sure of how these consequences will manifest themselves; these processes just happen at a scale larger than the human one. As one complexity scientist once told me, we trying to control them \"is like neurons trying to control the brain\".\u00a0\n\nWhat this means, I guess, is: you want change? The best thing to do is to focus on Hexayurt, or Edgeryders, or Wikicrazia, or network analysis, or mathematically fair decision making, or whatever our obsession might be. As these become local successes, they will feed into more far-reaching processes, and nudge them in the right direction. This is as close to strategizing as humans can do in a society embedded in, and driven by, larger-than-human scale emergent dynamics.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-24 21:48:13", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:39.567358", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 470, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11911, "user_id": 21, "topic_id": 1510, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Dettagli</b>\n\nCiao\n\nSono nato in un\u00a0 paese dove il lavoro duro di montagna iniziava il suo declino.\n\nPer\u00f2 ho avuto la fortuna di bere latte fresco di bovine alimentate naturalmente. questo mi ha reso forte e immune ha tante patologie presenti nella societ\u00e0 cosidetta moderna.\n\nSono passati 12 anni da quando io e mio fratello Walter decidemmo di vivere liberi\u00a0 imparando dagli animali.\n\nL'esperienza che ho raccontato sopra, mi ha reso consapevole della vita animale,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 da quando ho iniziato ha credere\u00a0alla natura mi sento parte della famiglia cosidetta ecosistema, qui e un tuttuno, si! siamo in competizione ma ci aiutiamo l'uno con l'altro, l'albero\u00a0 crea un ambiente piacevole quando il sole batte forte, L'acqua\u00a0 disseta tenendomi compagnia con il suo concerto interminabile, la bufala pulisce il prato lasciando il concime biologico, che noi prendiamo ( una parte lo usiamo per far germinare nuova erba, una parte lo lasciamo essicare per bruciarlo come combustibile biologico, e il restante lo diamo alle piante del orto e quelle del giardino, puoi immaginare come sono contente, crescono grasse.\n\nCome ti dicevo e un tuttuno, ci sono talmente tante storie da raccontare che non riesco ...\n\nIl\u00a0 progetto europeo\u00a0e di far crescere tante piccole comunit\u00e0 di giovani cittadini, formate da\u00a0cittadini che desiderano vivere senza\u00a0 trarre profitto dalla vita.\n\nIn questo contesto il lavoro rende l'uomo libero.\n\nIL vecchio \u00a0Mondo Rurale ( tutto cio che e connesso al ecosistema e i suoi ambienti biodiversi).\n\nL'uomo batteva il ferro caldo forgiando zappe\n\nLa donna curava l'orto con la zappa forgiata dal' uomo\n\nI\u00a0bambini giocavano felici saltando sopra il fieno, che la comunit\u00e0 raccoglieva per superare Il lungo inverno passato al caldo della fattoria, assieme agli amici animali trascorreva il tempo.

If democratic institutions had a way to do it, they would have done already. The real question is: how do we thrive in a post-employment \"robots stole my job\" economy?</li>\n\n<li>And anyway, who's \"we\"? Complexity theory teaches it that a great many things are emergent; experimental psychology teaches us that humans tend to overestimate human agency and underestimate other factors, like randomness and path dependencies. Combining these two, we get a picture that says \"we\" (as in \"we the people\") is a delusional concept: \"we\" don't really have much of a say in what happens. Conversely, we (no quote-unquote: we as in the emergent social dynamics resulting from our interactions with each other) are collectively and blindly bringing about mass unemployment (and worse: climate change, feral finance, globalization etc.) on each other. In this scenario, making a collective decision to solve some problem, even a \"right\" decision, is probably not going to help, because such decisions are unenforceable. What happens at the macro level, happens: it is only at the micro- (individual) and mesoscale (community) that we get our hands on the steering wheel. But we need to take the macro scenario as a given, including high and rising unemployment in the West.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nIt's a little grim, but liberating.

I spent two amazing years in Norway as a teenager, with other students from all over the world, we came together under the principles of peace and international understanding.

I felt that something needs to be done, we need to come together, we need to share and learn from each other. It just seemed so awful that at this point in time, all the Nordic parliaments have racist parties represented, there have been several incidents over the past decade that have increased intolerance, how do we learn from eachother so that we can actually put an end to it?\n\nI ended up organizing TO OSLO, WITH LOVE - a Nordic meeting that actually gathered 70 people coming from 15 countries, in a three day dialogue on where we go from here. The format was an Open Space, so the people themselves were the ones setting the agenda. This resulted in some 30 sessions ranging from personal stories and accounts from the attacks, to philosophical and strategic sessions on the types of education we need to build empathy and social cohesion.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/tooslowithlove/6471620315/\" style=\"width: 150px; float: right;\">For me personally, this gathering felt very strongly like a coming together of a lot of different things that I believe in: intercultural understanding and antiracism, co-creation and collective intelligence, passion drives initiative and personal relations lead to success.

Inner calm seems to encourage its development.</div><div>However, different expressions of enlightenment exist and have things in common:</div><div>-Hardware-detachment</div><div>-Aware of things and people increased.</div><div>-Greater tolerance and openness</div><div>...</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>In general, this is manifested by a greater curiosity and interest in things that do not directly affect the person. More the individual awakens, the more the other becomes more important in his heart, to become the priority.</div><div>The main examples of this type of spiritual elevation are the saints and mystics, but I think we can also meet much more varied, especially in the arts and manual labor, but also intellectual.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>Music, especially during concerts, is a good example. An alchemy created between group members, but also with the public. The musicians feel this connection, this force, this energy. It boosts their talent and their will to become the engine that drives them to continue to share their passion.</div><div>The expression of this force, this awakening, thus depends on each individual and especially his prism of consciousness.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>The prism of consciousness is the awareness that the individual has of his environment and the extent of this environment and the sum of its knowledge. Otherwise defined, the prism reflects the barriers and internal and external borders of a person. This prism defines the scope of an awakening but also its feasibility.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>Yogis and saints are shining examples of their material and spiritual detachment. Their words have survived the ages because their actions have shared their experience.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>I think there are far more expressions of this kind of awakening. Every person on earth can come alive.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>This awakening is similar to the quest of Nietzschean superman, \"You must become the man you are. Do what you alone can do. Become always who you are, be the master and the sculptor of yourself. \"</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>This quest is always personal and intimate, and its expression is too.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>So, how to identify and encourage the expression, this awakening, this quest?</div><div>I think it imperative to confront the individual in many situations and different approaches while being attentive to his reactions and his interest.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>It is also important to fight against beliefs. Many mental patterns can stifle the awakening or pervert. Beliefs, unlike knowledge, can prevent an individual from developing.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>In our individualistic societies, the dominant message says that happiness is in the ownership and individual fulfillment. Many obstacles can prevent the development of a spiritual person. Two worlds collide, and one great inner strength can help to awaken last.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>Internet and open source are already a way to find, develop and express his awakening. The first person who freely shared the fruits of his work has perhaps laid the seed of an awakening of humanity, which would join some theories of collective awakening. Indeed, the internet has it interesting that may materialize in part the collective consciousness.</div><div>In history, there are examples of inventions or ideas that have emerged around the same time at distances that did not allow their transmission. There are also examples of ideas that emerged to reappear later and elsewhere. Internet changes everything. And the canvas will be larger, collective consciousness that will materialize.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>The prism of consciousness corresponds to the things a person cares, its scope of impact in some way. In the case of monks or yogis, their prism is turned inward and their belief is: by raising me inside, I work in the collective consciousness. A friend made this choice and went to live in a monastery.</div><div>In the mystic and religious, the prism is also outside because they often share their thoughts and experiences, as Buddha or Krishna. Moult also act physically as Abbe Pierre.</div><div>Thus, number of people who attained enlightenment have allowed others to achieve it through their teachings. But not everyone can do it, and, according to individuals, it will take more or less time or may never even happen. Indeed, these \"manuals\" are from intimate beliefs and experiences that must be achieved to integrate and feel.</div><div>Thus, in this way to reach enlightenment can not be generalized because it is the result of individual experiences.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>In my opinion, everyone has their own energy which will find its own expression he has the chance to discover who he is, but also to build in accordance with this energy. Intelligence can be logical-mathematical, spatial, interpersonal, bodily-kinesthetic, verbal-linguistic, intrapersonal, musical-rhythmic and existential (see the theory of multiple intelligences). Individuals have always thrive in these areas.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>Education today, especially in France, seriously devalues \u200b\u200bthe logical-mathematical intelligence and even manages to pervert it. Indeed, this intelligence is often used for commercial purposes.</div><div>An educational approach combining these seven intelligences, with an infinite number of approaches, allow everyone to find their mode of expression, his voice, his quest, his enlightenment. Computer tools, teaching and educational could quickly help to identify patterns, ways to direct the individual to himself, to his deep and hidden strength.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>Many theories and philosophies speak of collective consciousness and personal quest. These two concepts are intimately related: moving towards his personal quest contributes to the collective consciousness.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>Internet already allows us to observe this in part through the open source and methods of information exchange and virtual collaboration. More and more people are able to flourish because they have access to many more possibilities and different paths in the physical world. There are many people like this on atypical Edgeryders for example, self-made men, independent thinkers, self-taught ...</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>If education uses the internet, free knowledge, cooperation and collaboration, and especially if she continues to direct and compartmentalize knowledge, we could well see the emergence of a new human being. The idea of \u200b\u200bLuminous man fascinates me as a person radiates in full bloom around him and sparkles that can inspire such dazzling.</div><div>But I would prefer a simple definition of Free Man who has the means to accomplish, to discover and choose his own life.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>It is also possible to <strong>widen the prism of consciousness</strong> towards a more global awareness of fairly simply. The prism expands during encounters and discoveries. It can also decrease when an individual withdraws into itself and is locked within four walls, physical or mental, which often happens in today's societies.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>A person trapped in these four walls limit his consciousness to this prison that the World Cup outside where his deep person can not or do not know how to express themselves.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>Two worlds collide: a world within a single, standardized and multiple external world which does not leave much room for these unique worlds.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>That shock, more or less violent depending on individuals and their environment, could explain many \"mental illnesses\" and depressions, because the outside world is stronger and has many tools of deception, manipulation and illusion as we don ' in'd never known.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>The prism of consciousness can be extended only by comparing the individual to new worlds and realities, both physical and mental.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>\u00a0</div><div><strong>The tree of consciousness</strong></div><div>The prism of consciousness can be likened to the branches of a tree. Awakening is a seed that we all possess and which is unique to each. It germinates more or less naturally and when it grows, it adapts to its environment. Thus, each trunk takes a different shape and texture.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>The foliage is our knowledge and our awareness of the world. A curious person will have a growing number of different branches, and many are its leaves and fruit.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>A person trapped between four walls will have a tree where only a few branches bloom, the rest is not powered.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>We are the gardeners of this tree, and by our choices, we have the antlers. Some let it grow a little wildly, or prune branches regularly. But we are not the only ones able to influence our personal tree.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>Others can graft branches or cut, some have even made their specialty.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>However, each individual is the guardian of his own sacred tree, and he is its master.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>\u00a0</div>", "created_at": "2012-06-19 13:03:28", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:55.146004", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1705, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2336, "user_id": 1692, "topic_id": 2303, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Here is a new version of the prototype.

Some of you might've seen me snooping around a bit on Edgeryders for the past week. I was introduced to you by Noemi regarding the Spot the Future project. I would very much like to be involved in the project, as not only I think this is a great project (creating a baseline by asking local innovators), but also because I believe I could contribute to it. So, who am I? Well, I have lived in and out of Georgia for the past 6.5 years in which I not only have mastered the language - a pretty difficult one I might say - but also have acquired a large professional network. During these past years I have worked in journalism and civil society, which I have truly enjoyed. Then: why Georgia? Why do I keep on coming back here? It's a difficult question, but it has a rather easy answer: the life here. In Georgia there might not be a lot of money around, but Georgians do know how to organize several different things interesting for the people around. For example, when I had just arrived 7 years ago, a group of DJs, producers and artists had set up the group CUMBO. With hardly any money, they organized every weekend a club night in an abandoned bunker. This practice is something which Georgians had to learn during the 'dark 90s': every now and then musicians and artists would take their materials and organize a concert, exhibition, discussion group, etc, for their peers in a free location. Lately it has been much harder to organize such events on your own initiative, but it still happens. For example, the newly initiated ACCT (Art Collective Center Tbilisi) which was set up to organize several community based events. Or the current Vake Park protest, where activists camp out to stop the construction of a luxury hotel, or guerilla gardening, who have crated several different community gardens out of trashed spaces. Due to my background, my network and my enthusiasm, I think I could be a valuable asset to your team. I hope to be working with you in the near future!\n\nAnd for my digital footprint:\n\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/lingelien\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"http://adjapsandali.wordpress.com/\">Blog</a>, <a href=\"http://lingelien.tumblr.com/\">Tumblr</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/lingelien\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/ingesnip/\">Linkedin</a>, <a href=\"http://plus.google.com/+IngeSnip\">Google+</a>.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-03-10 11:45:26", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:13.446401", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 425, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 55.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 1818], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3722, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 3689, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Just a quick link share that I found helpful because it shows what kind of projects get funded, so helps to check what chance an own project might have at all:\n\nThe European Commission has released <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/easme/sme/beneficiaries_en.htm\">information about the beneficiaries of the first H2020 SME Instrument funding round</a>.

No matter how much we try to ignore the bigger picture and focus on input-output processes, these are part of bigger picture, closed-loop systems whether we like it or not.  Closed-loop systems aren't an 'option'.  If we ignore the broader system, we tend to stuff things up.\n\nThe choice is not whether we create input-output vs closed-loop systems.  The choice is not whether we cocreate vs work in segregated, stifling and closed ways.  The choice is whether we acknowledge reality and act accordingly, or whether we remain willfully ignorant and act in ways that have unintended impacts.\n\nCan this proposition underpin a philosophy of cocreation?", "created_at": "2014-03-23 03:17:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:13.757031", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 168, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2651, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 2618, "post_number": 1, "raw": "HI Everyone!

In such an environment, perhaps, initiatives and projects would not go over to the dark side!</li>\n\n<li><b>Julia</b>\u00a0said that psychological biases are well documented; raising the awareness of what they are and do might help us make better decisions, both individually and collectively. I believe she was referring to Kahneman-Tversky behavioral economics stuff, because she mentioned the System 1/System 2 model.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li><b>Kira</b>\u00a0offered a praise of failure, and how sharing your experience of failure can help everyone involved to get better at what we do. That might be another safeguard against the dark side.</li>\n\n<li><b>Thomas</b>\u00a0told us about the Abilene model to corroborate Julia's point, and had a spectacular failure to offer \u2013 one involving flying whales, a guy who jumped the Berlin wall heading East and the London Olympics.</li>\n\n<li><b>Johannes</b>\u00a0expressed optimism that complex systems can, indeed, be designed.

This might not be so bad because powerful hackers tend not to be the same people as powerful non-hackers, so the net result is that some people have one kind of power, and other people have another kind of power, and this way there are more people around with at least\u00a0<i>some</i>\u00a0kind of power.</li>\n\n<li><b>Ezio</b>\u00a0observed that hackers do the same thing as creatives always did, but they have their own rhetoric and tribal culture.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li><b>Thomas</b>\u00a0said that the cultural impulse to subvert can go to far and backfire.

Credo sia importante, accanto alla esposizione filosofica e concettuale del Progetto, divulgare questa fase \u201ccore\u201d di OpenCare, che tra l'altro credo abbia dato vita ad analoghe fasi in altri Paesi d'Europa, rendendo maggiormente percepibile e comprensibile il disegno \u201cpolitico\u201d di questa iniziativa.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn secondo luogo, proprio prendendo le mosse dalla precedente osservazione, mi sembra sia necessario elaborare ed affinare una strategia che coinvolga maggiormente gli utenti finali, i \u201cportatori\u201d di interessi, che nel corso di questi mesi \u00e8 stato difficile raggiungere e consolidare attorno al processo di prototipazione e di verifica \u201csul campo\u201d della soluzione adottata all'interno del Makerspace WeMake. Naturalmente, conoscendo molto bene la storica difficolt\u00e0 di interazione fattiva e progettuale che l'arcipelago del bisogno ha al proprio interno e le distorsioni \u201crelazionali\u201d che quest'ultimo ha con le amministrazioni pubbliche locali, pur ritenendo sia comunque mancata una attivit\u00e0 di intellighentia e di dialogo di alto livello, considero opportuno quanto percorribile oggi \u2013 e maggiormente nel futuro \u2013 un processo di sensibilizzazione e di formazione diretta, non solo agli utenti finali ma anche alle diverse professionalit\u00e0 e competenze che gravitano attorno ad essi, sulle direttrici teoriche di OpenCare, sui meccanismi internazionali che regolamentano la partecipazione ed il finanziamento internazionale, sulle sfide concettuali e le dinamiche culturali che muovono nel mondo moltissime persone, sugli aspetti prettamente tecnici e scientifici che, nel complesso, contribuiscano a tratteggiare un ambiente che richiede il cambio da uno storico atteggiamento \u2013 passivo ed assistenzialista \u2013 in una serie di attivit\u00e0 di integrazione e di proazione condivisa e partecipata.\n\nIl mio sogno \u00e8 la realizzazione di un gruppo consapevole e maturo di persone in grado di incidere realmente sia nei processi decisionali sia nelle fasi di realizzazione di prodotti e soluzioni da essi adottati successivamente in modo ampio quanto infrastrutturale. Una sorta di lobby, gruppo di pressione, che finalmente possa dirigere il processo di integrazione e di convivenza civile attraverso i paradigmi della condivisione e della sostenibilit\u00e0 delle idee.\n\nMagari partendo proprio da OpenCare, da una sua futura evoluzione in una piattaforma-laboratorio delle idee possibili e realizzabili con il mezzo delle tecnologie della condivisione, della progettazione e della realizzazione!\n\n\u00a0\n\nGrazie\n\n", "created_at": "2016-11-20 11:16:35", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:51.484613", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 546, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3136, "user_id": 2178, "topic_id": 3103, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hi all, I'm @Marc 's sister !

I organized a number of book reading events, during which I was exploring the mentality of participants, as well as finding out the effects of the books on them. Unfortunately, what I found out was that they read mostly materialist and idealist literature. Romanticism is left back in remote era of Renaissance, which is a pity, I think.

Ironically young people spend really a lot of time on just random talks and discussions of different issues and ideas on Facebook, but when they get invited to come and talk about those issues personally, in order to find solutions, they often don\u2019t show up.

It has been a really great learning journey; and, for such a long shot, I submit we did surprisingly well. We made many mistakes, but even those are bearing fruit.\u00a0\n\nSo I made my weary way to Matera and spent a few days living like an unMonk \u2013 waking up at <a href=\"/u/bembo_davies\">@Bembo Davies</a>\u00a0's seven o'clock bell, doing my fair share of kitchen duty and working out of The Cave, the downstairs working space. As a bonus, I got to be at the strangely moving unClosing event. The many Materans who flocked to the event looked unnerved, as if the unMonastery were leaving them just as they were finally getting a full grasp of it. Is the unMonastery really going away? Will it be back?\u00a0\n\nThese experiences are too strong to ever really go away. <a href=\"/u/marc\">@Marc</a>\u00a0is staying; activities are scheduled around <a href=\"/t/kiderwind/581\">Kiderwind</a> in August; and of course <a href=\"/welcome-to-lote4\">LOTE4</a> is going to bring many more Edgeryders to Matera in October, with a coordination team working out of the unMonastery starting in September. Plus, the dialog with the city of Matera continues; we are working towards locating in town the School of unMonastery as the center of the movement.\n\nBut we do need a break to digest these incredible six months. One material to meditate is <a href=\"/u/nicobis\">@NicoBis</a>'s incredible videos, including this one produced for the unClosing ceremony. Thanks to the valiant <a href=\"/u/lucasg\">@LucasG</a>\u00a0for leading on translating subtitles into English, Italian and Spanish.

I know about it but I did not had time to look in details as to why is is so.\n\nYou are entirely right about the current behaviour of the DOI view. At the moment, I use two different graphs as basis: one which contains <em>users</em>, <em>posts</em> and <em>comments</em>, and a second one which contains <em>posts</em>, <em>comments</em> and <em>tags</em>. The first graph is the \"old\" solution which does not take into account <em>tags</em> and is more oriented toward a social network point of view where users are at the center (when you look for users in the DOI view, this is the graph the result is based on). The second graph is focused on content instead and is used for instance with the neighbour display.\n\nWhat the DOI does is, starting from a node, find the best candidates around <u>and beyond</u> and add them to the selection according to some measure. Finding which indice or metric is appropriate is the current problem. As you have seen using the degree to grade the nodes is worthless as nodes with the highest degree will always out-balance the others. For instance, take a look at the resulting graphs with three different users as focus:\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c87ed2ed36779d65ed310bddbe560d27d8b494a1.png\" width=\"520\" height=\"500\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/0/0904f282a0e1395be0cee67c0ee64f0267e0186d.png\" width=\"459\" height=\"500\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/e/efc0cd4e7501364a797e3950985fb22838d7b5f6.png\" width=\"391\" height=\"500\">\n\nWe have several nodes in common which are always present due to their over-whelming degrees in comparison to the rest of the nodes. So we are looking for a way to work around this problem. Note that the same problem appear when looking at tags, for instance:\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9a29f3f63ded52337eca047ebfbdc77d431fa5a0.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"438\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7f5b11fdf1b3d414fbeb58b8c0fba5bec1a5c69b.png\" width=\"642\" height=\"500\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/79d4494300c8f2e1056301a8df57319a796cc5ea.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"433\">\n\nThe views are out-balanced by the usual behemoth <strong>research question</strong>, <strong>migration</strong>, <strong>case-study</strong> and <strong>community-based care</strong>, which, due to their high degree are deemed more interesting by the algorithm, thus ignoring other elements closer to the initial node.\n\nSo we are working on changing the doi view (and its name!) to something which is more focused on the content, and use co-occurrences and common innovations subjects (to a lesser extent) to find content related to the initial post/comment.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-02-28 12:30:04", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:41.456077", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 607, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 15.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [16980], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3524, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 3491, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<strong>1.

I can contribute with my knowledge of local markets where i operate and put that perspective to help new ideas for others.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-09-17 18:20:29", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:19.918622", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 113, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1457, 2333], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3686, "user_id": 1658, "topic_id": 3653, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<b>https://metalab.at/\n\n@MetalabVie\u00a0 </b>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<hr>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>Based behind the city hall in the centre of Vienna lies <b>Metalab</b>, an open space for technical and creative projects.

Yet it is vital that its powerful prefigurative potential is allied to a structural or macro critique of the current system. It is only through this that it stands a chance of preventing its energies being cut off, captured and folded back into the very structures it purports to challenge.\n\nStewardship offers a model for seizing the means of \u2018social reproduction\u2019. That is to say, the work - both waged and unwaged - of maintaining a home, community, food and children. Our aim here is to understand how this work is both the structurally essential means by which a system of private accumulation recreates itself anew each day, but also \u2013 importantly \u2013 the means by which, in our own hands, we might begin to imagine living our lives autonomously, of both capital and the state.\n\nIn this workshop we will discuss the crucial importance of marrying the notion of stewardship to a wider structural critique of private and state ownership and provision. One of the ways we will do this is by making a rather unlikely return to the concept of \u2018psychogeography\u2019: popularised in the 1950s and revived in the 1990s, as a means of gaining a deeper understanding of the various forces at play in the urban environment.\n\nWe will explore five theses on how a return to some of the practices associated with psychogeography allows us to better understand the strategic points essential for the social reproduction of our communities. Through this we will not only work towards a list of strategic \u2018stewardship targets\u2019, but also examine how a range of psychogeographic practices provide us with potential tactics for this task.\n\nThe five theses we will explore are:\n\n1, Psychogeography as a contested term: dead words and trojan horses.\n\n2, Psychogeography as enquiry: the political and strategic value of study, as both end and means.\u00a0\n\n3, Objective Chance: having enquired into existing means of social production, how we might use psychogeography to uncover another world sleeping within this one, and to construct new economies of desire.\n\n4, Triolectics: A playful way of thinking to destabilise of the logic of enclosure and accumulation.\n\n5, Psychogeography as cryptogramme: the development of a clandestine \u2018infra-literature\u2019 to propagate in favour of these newly discovered desires, one which is less about visibility and more about autonomous social relations.\n\nDate: 2014-10-25 10:00:00 - 2014-10-25 10:00:00, Europe/London Time.", "created_at": "2014-10-02 11:44:35", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:20.376240", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 440, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3808, "user_id": 2363, "topic_id": 3775, "post_number": 1, "raw": "In what has been termed the \u2018share economy\u2019, the ideal of \u2018common ownership\u2019 has been perverted by capital to create value through the self-exploitation of the readily sharing prosumer.

In parallel with the \\#temporarycustodianship, the Islington Mill community are already shared custodians (or stewards) of the building. However, it is currently owned out-right by one individual and they are seeking to transfer the asset of the building over to a shared ownership model which is as yet undefined. As part of this they are researching models that will enable power to be spread across institutions, one example being liquid democracy (utilised by the Pirate Party who run their UK HQ from Islington Mill).\n\nThe following questions will be addressed:\n\n1)What does a steward/ custodian look like?\n\n2)What are the organisational blue prints for retaining a power share across a community of custodians/ stewards?\n\n3)How might the question of the building as an asset be considered within the wider ecology of sharing of assets?\u00a0\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\nDate: 2014-10-24 14:30:00 - 2014-10-24 14:30:00, Europe/London Time.", "created_at": "2014-10-10 13:35:18", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:20.658442", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 457, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 10.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3867, "user_id": 2334, "topic_id": 3834, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<a href=\"http://fablabamersfoort.nl/en/about-us\">http://fablabamersfoort.nl/en/about-us</a>\n\nAccording to the story, 4 artists were sitting complaining about the cost of equipment hire and setting up a studio for themselves, when one artist's partner said, \"I'm sick of hearing about you talking about this.

So, for example, a financial meltdown can start out bad or worse, and may later conceivably morph into, well, war. If the threat is (or becomes) bad enough, domino effects start to happen, and then it almost doesn't matter what started it. Resilience that keeps a broad view, but that's also locally specific, is - I think - the way to go.\n\nNow, we only have 2.5 hours, so I think we need to do like when we eat spaghetti: select where to stick the fork, then spin the fork once or twice depending on how big our mouth is.\n\nIf we go for \"health\":\n\n1) We could use a strictly limited time to look at a few \"worst impacts in vital areas\". No need to cover it all, and no need to agree on everything.

(Not with business as usual, because this is not about \"saving the grid\" but about \"staying warm in winter\". Focus on needs, not in old systems.) We don't need to be experts in technicalities, and I'd personally find it a good secondary outcome if we come up with a list of questions for specialists.

In the course of Spot The Future Belarus we discovered that the Belarusian civil society has incredible expertise, and is using it in many groundbreaking projects on social innovation, tech, social inclusion of disadvantaged groups and many other areas. We think this expertise should be used to advise the government as it plans the next moves: people active in these areas know better than anyone else the problems on the ground.\u00a0\n\nWe have a fantastic opportunity. The Ministry of the economy is working on a document called the National Strategy for Sustainable Development. The NSSD is very broad, and touches on most areas that are of interest to Belarusian changemakers, from quality of life for people with disabilities all the way to sustainable mobility and transport. So, we are trying to produce a civil society position paper, a set of recommendations that tell the government what it can do to facilitate the work of the people that are already working on these issues. UNDP takes responsibility for presenting it to the Ministry of the economy. We do this in the context of a workshop, to be held on November 17th [place and time].\n\nRemember:\u00a0this is not a survey<em>.</em>\u00a0<em>We are inviting you as a designer of solutions</em>.

To save ourselves time we are looking at what reports are out there already and if they fullfill our needs.\n\nThis report is one such example:\n\n\" In April 2013 the Directorate General for Education and Culture (DG EAC) of the European Commission asked the European Expert Network on Culture (EENC) to produce a short report examining the main trends of public funding for culture in EU Member States.\n\nThe research focused on public budgets for the cultural and creative sectors as provided by governmental departments in charge of cultural affairs or other public bodies to which responsibilities for cultural policy have been allocated, as well as on other forms of data classification which make cultural purposes explicit, insofar as this data was available.\n\nThe initial aim was to collect data for 2012 and 2013 as well as initial forecasts for 2014. However, the lack of available data in many countries and years, alongside with the wish to present figures in a longer-term framework to facilitate the interpretation of trends, has led the research team to collect data also for previous years through both the Eurostat and OECD databases which, moreover, present it in a uniform, comparable format.\n\nThe examination of the statistics of public expenditure of the last years reveals different, sometimes even opposite, patterns between cultural and total spending as well as between central and local budgets, respectively. With regard to the individual countries, the analysis reveals no overall \u201cEuropean trend\u201d in how the new financial environment has affected public cultural funding. In most cases trends follow the curves of general public budgets in each country: when and where government budgets suffer major reductions cultural expenditure also falls to a large degree. This correlation between general and cultural budgets is, however, not automatic. In most countries the crisis had an immediate impact on the budgets of central governments, reaching local (regional and municipal) finances in later waves.\n\nThe report was written by <strong>V. \u010copi\u010d</strong>, <strong>P.

He preaches that open government creates jobs. He embraces change without batting an eyelash, deals with turmoil with serene calmness. Through chaos, he always sees opportunities for action and for business. Throughout his career, it became increasingly clear to John that open communication, honest dialog, is a key component for success for all individuals, organizations, and governments.\n\nJohn's vision of open government is a worldwide collaboration. He invites all to participate in making his online magazine better, by constantly requesting input and encouraging action. He has the ability to increase optimism, raise energy, and momentum: he creates movement. John enhances and disseminates knowledge created through collaborative and productive relationships locally, nationally and worldwide.\n\nIf you take the time to know John, you will find out it is time to start dreaming again, test new ideas, try new things and challenge the status quo.

As well as to explore new approaches towards drawing much needed resources to community-powered projects where important work is often unseen and undervalued.\n\nBased on personal observation of many attempts to pitch projects to prospective clients and or funders, a recurring obstacle seems to be making the connection between projects/efforts to tackle challenges at a micro-scale, and larger problems that would be clients or funders are faced with <em>(and timing your pitch to coincide with windows of opportunity where resources are actually available)</em>. This work of building a narrative bridge requires collective intelligence as the challenges we face are far too difficult for any one person or small group of people to tackle alone. The second reason for trying to do this in a participatory manner is that gaining a shared understanding of issues is a key enabler for building shared solutions. \n\nThis report was built with the aim of supporting participants own reflections and future work. The idea was to produce a deck of slides that anyone can use for their own purposes, e.g building project proposals or doing public presentations.

I spent ten days in Galway as part of Edgeryders's commitment to advise the City of Galway on its bid as European Capital of Culture 2020. The Galway 2020 team asked us to build a part of their cultural programme we are calling Edge of Culture. It aims to create space in the 2020 adventure for initiatives and movements for deep societal change: social innovation, environmentalism, collaborative economy, open source technology, citizen science, sustainable mobility, community wellness, hacking in all its manifestations.\n\nI spent the week meeting individuals and groups doing amazing work in all of these areas. There is an Irish word that recurs: <em>Meitheail</em>, which means \"community coming together\", or \"barnraising\". The word might be new to non-Irish speakers, but the concept is dear to the heart of all Edgeryders. Community-created, community-stewarded, bottom-up infrastructure is what brings us all together in the end.\n\nWhere does it all go? It goes in Galway's bid to become European Capital of Culture, for sure. But that's only the first step of the way. In the next few weeks we will attempt to connect the most visionary-yet-concrete projects in Galway with European partners. That means <em>you</em>. Your dreams, your struggle, your ability to deliver. In four weeks you could find yourself a partner in a continental-level alliance for breaking new grounds in culture, hacking and, well, Meitheail. I think this is where the magic really happens. If Galway's bid wins, well, that's great. Some projects will be funded, and they will start deploying as early as 2017. If it loses, we will still have the ideas, the writeups and the partnerships, and there will be other opportunities.\n\nThe <a href=\"/t/about-the-culture-squad-group/613\">Culture Squad</a> is where all these opportunities are shared. Edgeryders has decided to put in some coordination work to help people in this community find each other and develop projects together. Regardless of whether Galway becomes European Capital of Culture 2020 or not, I think some of the brave folks I have been meeting in Galway will stay with us. We will keep you updated on the projects being developed in Galway: talk to <a href=\"/u/noemi\">Noemi</a> or myself if you want to be involved with any of them.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-03-18 13:03:42", "updated_at": "2017-09-10 19:59:59.389122", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 433, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2569, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13717, "user_id": 1861, "topic_id": 3289, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Thanks!</b>\n\nLooks great!\n\n", "created_at": "2014-07-14 15:41:30", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:17.526001", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 7, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [13533], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1363, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1330, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://craphound.com/images/5809073713_d1c97d8d8e_z.jpg\">((photo: Marko Rakar)\n\nSome are just really talented at making waves! Believe it or not, vigilantes, modern Cervante's Don Quixote still exist today. However, their adventures aren't in knight-errantry, but more about data transparency. In true democracies, information belongs to the public. More often than not, the only remedies to democratic defects comes from determined citizens taking the initiative to do something that serves the public interest.\n\nMarko Rakar, a well known data transparency and open governance activist, made a stir in his country on several occasions. He runs Croatia's largest blog, <a href=\"http://www.Pollitika.com\">Pollitika.com</a>. He is recognized by World eGovernment forum as one of the \"Top 10 who are changing the world of politics on the Internet\".\n\nIn 2009, with a group of people, Marko published a Croatian fraud-ridden voter registry files. Marko's group created a simple search engine, which showed number of registered voters on particular adress so anyone was able to check for his household or his neighbours how many registered voters are there. This triggered a constitution crisis and reform effort in Croatia.\n\nHe recently published an enormous database of government procurements, pointing to detecting corruption and fraud. \"It is easy to track and identify \"winners\" in the public procurement field and it is really easy to spot highly unusual contractors,\" explained Marko.\n\n<strong>Read more about Marko </strong>\n\n<a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/users/mrakar\">http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/users/mrakar</a>\n\n", "created_at": "2012-03-08 04:00:01", "updated_at": "2017-09-20 16:01:25.627276", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 275, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 30.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4485, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4452, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Following a suggestion by <a href=\"/u/hegazy\">@Hegazy</a>, we are reaching out to open data scenes in all countries involved in FutureMakers Global.

It works because it is designed with participants shared interests at heart. We surface common ideas in the runup to the event and make everyone a protagonist. By the time we meet in a room, we will have met each other online and will be ready to get down to concrete How-Tos.\n\nEdgeRyders from all over are invited!

By citizens, volunteers, this is not supported financially. Only have some partnrrships with municipality and other organizations. They give people a change to renovate their environment, better understanding of what the city can be, they have a website that shows urban development in other countries; the group is called dream kyiv.\n\nThe other organization I talked to is called magnificant, these people are ttrying to involve active yoth communities to participate in small things around their cities, to do little nice tings for everyone, aa spread of kindness around ukraine, they do projects to help elderly, support street art, brining joy to people, nice design inelevators, or to going and seeing elderly and orphanages, painting yards, lots and lots of social events, whch bring smiles on poeples faces, they are not supported by anyone, its just young people who are trying to benefit others.\n\nNadia wants to know how do they get people involved, do they use gaming approach? check out serious games like urgent evoke and ask them to compare their approach?\n\nAlso http://makecity.berlin/ and designforthelivingworld.com\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Problems in Egypt, Belarus, Armenia</h3>\n\npeople are not willing to share as they do in Ukraine (and Georgia)\n\nHegazy had an interviewee asking him to take the interview down\n\nArmenia: people/organizations are not willing, because they don't understand why it is useful for them, they are not open to joining. engagement is difficult \"we don't have time\" etc. We dont really need this, we dont really care\u201d it is difficult to engage them. people/organizations are not willing, because they don't understand why it is useful for them, they are not open to joining. engagement is difficult\n\nMatthias tip from Nepal: https://edgeryders.eu/en/future-makers-nepal/writers-workshop-reflecting-on-a-really-long-day\n\nMatthias: \"the point about interviews and getting them to be interviewed, they do like to share, but they do need to find the time, but it is a quite workable approach, we have now 8 tot 10 interviews online, as a dialogue starter on the platform, but it is difficult to get people away from facebook, and get them to the edgeryders platform, they are not doing it yet. Facebook is the social network online, and also they dont really like to have everything out in the open, so public. Meetings are only in khatmandu, and they are meeting face to face, so its not in europe where it is less easy to meet face to face. What works however is to take over paradigm, and see it as a media/press space, and how this worked is online.We are now planning for a writing competition, which is what is workable, you get a lot of motivated submissions.<strong>Writer's competition.

The full conversation includes 324 posts, 1,470 comments for a total of 360,000 words.\n\nWe set out to do two things:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Use the co-occurrences graph as a way to explore the patterns of association across ethno tags throughout the opencare conversation.</li>\n\n<li>Reduce the co-occurrences graph to provide an intuitive, high-level description of the opencare conversation.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">The co-occurrences graph as a gateway for exploring the conversation</h3>\n\nWe used the ego network as our main tool of exploration:\u00a0\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/4/44fe328b3a684f884687fc1de3534842cf2eeb81.jpeg\" width=\"690\" height=\"392\">\n\nWe agreed that this is a generative method. However, there is a difficulty: the unfiltered co-occurrences is too dense to explore. So, we explored instead filtered versions of the same. At the same time, when isolating an ego network it makes sense to re-surface\u00a0<em>all</em>\u00a0connections centered on the ego tag, including those who get filtered out.\n\nWe also agreed that this way of exploring is incomplete without the possility\u00a0to \"drill\u00a0down\" to reading the post(s)/comment(s) behind the most interesting co-occurrence edges. It generates questions\u00a0(\"Why are people making the connection between \"mental health\" and \"translation\"?), and reading what actually people were saying when they made that connection provides answers and further insights. Fortunately, this is what the Bordeaux group is already coding.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">The reduced co-occurrences graph as a high-level description of the conversation</h3>\n\nWe reduced the co-occurrences graph filtering for number of different users making the same co-occurrence at least\u00a0<code>n</code>\u00a0times.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>When\u00a0<code>n = 1</code>\u00a0(not reduced) there are 587 tags connected by 7,489 co-occurrences.</li>\n\n<li>When\u00a0<code>n &gt;= 2</code>\u00a0there are 261 tags connected by 944 co-occurrences</li>\n\n<li>When\u00a0<code>n &gt;= 3</code>\u00a0there are 116 tags connected by 215 co-occurrences.</li>\n\n<li>When\u00a0<code>n &gt;= 4</code>\u00a0there are 53 tags connected by 80 co-occurrences.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThe graph reduced for\u00a0<code>n &gt;= 4</code>\u00a0yields the clearest results for our data:\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/2/2b06fbda258c8801dfe2da1d7b5c6f4e48b316c2.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"492\">\n\nEdges are colour-coded for number of different authors making the same association between the two tags (redder edges encode more authors. The maximum number of different authors behind an edge is 8; in the filtered graph, the minimum value is of course 4). Nodes are size-coded for degree (number of connections) in the unreduced graph.\n\nThere is clear structure in this graph. There are smaller connected components with two or three tags each; and a giant component. The latter is itself highly structured. There is a \"mainland\" to the west, where the most frequent co-occurrences are\u00a0<code>migration-building relationships</code>,\u00a0<code>migration-resource strain</code>,\u00a0<code>resource strain-crisis</code>\u00a0and\u00a0<code>community based care-distributing care burden</code>. A \"peninsula\" to the west, formed of tags clustered around mental health, connects to the mainland only through one single tag,\u00a0<code>skill sharing</code>. We can hazard several tentative conclusions, such us:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Migration is seen by the opencare community as the biggest care issue on the table.</li>\n\n<li>Migration is closely tied to several other care issues. It is almost as migration were a compounding factor.</li>\n\n<li>Mental health and stress are a major concern for this community.</li>\n\n<li><code>skill sharing</code>\u00a0(the only \"bridge\" between the mainland and the western \"island\") is very central in this graph. This is probably associated to the fact that upskilling community members is a central tenet of community-provided care.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nWhat do you think? Do you see what we are seeing? Does the graph talk to you? Networks lovers, we would love to hear from you!\n\n", "created_at": "2016-11-30 08:06:37", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:34.499160", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 955, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 296.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12758, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 3554, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Let's create teams for real, it solves several issues</b>\n\nCurrently, the <a href=\"/t/lote4-the-stewardship/359-dashboard\">LOTE4 teams</a> are modeled as tasks, which confused @Alberto already, so probably many others. This modelling came to pass because what is now \"teams\" was initially presented as \"big tasks to pick from to contribute to the conference ... but just seven selected ones to not overwhelm new users with details\". This modelling is admittedly not ideal, and is also the exact issue that prevents us from implementing @Ben's proposal of per-team task lists. Because, a task cannot reference another task ...\n\n<strong>Solution proposal</strong>\n\nSo I looked around in detail, and I think I found a clean solution. If nobody objects, I would try to implement it tomorrow as follows:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>There will be a content\u00a0 type \"Team\", and it gets the \"Group\" behavior from the OG (Organic Groups) module just like \"Project\" has now, but also the \"Group content\" behavior by which it can be associated with Projects itself.</li>\n\n<li>But you won't see teams among the list of projects to choose from when associating content (like tasks) to projects.</li>\n\n<li>Instead, a new Entity Reference field will be added to tasks (and only to tasks for now) to reference group entities of the \"Teams\" bundle.</li>\n\n<li>When associating a task to a team, one will only see the teams associated to the task's project in the options. There is <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/node/1507608#comment-8178015\">a nice filtering technique</a> in Drupal that can do this. (In addition to that technique, I would use the og_group_ref URL parameter as input for the group ID contextual filter \u2013 since this parameter is present when a task is being created but not yet saved, serving to prepopulate the \"Projects\" field then.)</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Discussion of alternatives</strong>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>Teams as or per task category.</strong> The first alternative solution is adding a \"task category\" field to tasks like we had (\"Technical task\", \"Design task\" etc.). It would be a taxonomy term field, with possibly a hierarchical taxonomy, and possibly project specific taxonomy terms via either <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/og_vocab\">og_vocab</a> or <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/reference_option_limit\">reference_option_limit</a>. However, I consider this solution inferior because it does not really capture the usual semantics one wants to confer by tagging a task as, for example, \"Design task\": that it should be done <em>by the design team</em>. There could still be a Team content type, but as it would not be of the OG Group behavior type like proposed above, the connection to a task category would be informal, which again is poor (missing!) semantic modeling. So, for proper semantic modeling, teams should be a proper content type that can have members, allowing for example to send notifications about new content for the team with the OG notification system (and honoring the containing Project's notification settings).</li>\n\n<li><strong>Teams as projects.</strong> The second alternative solution would be to use existing Projects for modeling teams. The advantage is that the UI for joining and leaving a team, and the notification system for new content, is already in place. But it clutters the Projects namespace to the point of utter confusion, as exemplified during the Spot the Future exercise, where in the end people resorted to cross-posting everything to all of the four or so STF related coordination groups <img alt=\"frown\" height=\"23\" src=\"/profiles/commons/libraries/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/confused_smile.png\" title=\"frown\" width=\"23\"></li>\n\n<li><strong>Teams as sub-projects.</strong> The third alternative is modifying Projects so they can be sub-projects of each other (simple to do by adding the \"Group content\" behavior to Projects). However, this unnecessarily establishes the general concept of a \"hierarchy of projects\", which comes with complexity and uncertainty about how the hierarchy behaves regarding notifications, membership and navigation (we had subgroups in the original Edgeryders Drupal 6 site, and I found them confusing). I want projects to be a flat list, like in all other established project hosting sites that I know of, from SourceForge to Github.</li>\n\n</ol>", "created_at": "2014-09-05 00:01:00", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:42.403554", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 729, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [12206], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1317, "user_id": 4922, "topic_id": 1284, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<div>\n\n<span>Right now I\u2019m trying to figure out how to live in a place I want to be. And to learn to trust in the world and behave in a way that promotes trust in the world by others.</span>\n\n<span>I\u2019ve been poor. Very very poor. The kind of poor where you\u2019ve just spent your last krown (Im swedish) on a kilogram of pasta two weeks before the end of the month and don\u2019t know how to pay the rent. Somehow I did manage to be creative during those periods but I remember an omnipresent sense of fear about the future. Not fear of not being able to feed myself, because I could always ask my parents for help in the worst case scenario, but of being too low on the social ladder to have an exciting fun life with exciting sparkly people around me in exciting sparkly fun environments. And fear of lynch mobs. </span>\n\n<span>My heart sank when the results of the national elections came in. I had always been warned that minorities, people who look different are always scapegoats as soon as the majority feels their livelihoods are at stake. But I saw first one fundamentally wealthy nation attack it\u2019s minorities (Denmark) and then another one go down the ugly road of divisiveness (Sweden) within my lifetime.  A friend\u2019s grandparents, Holocaust survivors, to this day always have a packed emergency suitcase in their hallway. And in  middle school many of my classmates were kids of Polish and Russian academics who had fled their respective countries to make a new life in Sweden. I can completely understand the drive and in fact I find myself always taking into account the possible need to leave very quickly, to escape. I think even my professional choices have been coloured by this in choosing to be in a new space (Tech) where the roles are not really all that cemented yet and the underlying values are ones of sharing and meritocracy. </span>\n\n<span>At some level my brain is wired to equare money with security, and more money means more personal security- gated communities etc. And I yet never seem to be interested enough to stick to a path that leads to more of it. Actually my story is a string of failed attempts at mad and completely unrealistic projects that dont pay. First I decided I wanted to build an Online distribution platform for short films and interactive content, it was to be called the Digital Arts Mirror or DAM.  I tried to build it by writing plan after plan and pitching them to different parts of the public and private sector. What\u2019s wierd is that people actually humored me and were\u2019nt too condescending so I just kept going, running around between different film festivals, bullshitting my way into meetins etc. At some point I had managed to get together a group of 10 people, and we would have lots of meeting that never lead to anything until eventually it fizzled out. The reason being plain and simple that I didn\u2019t have the production or programming skills to just go ahead and make it happen without needing to raise capital, to pay someone to do it for me. And it was too all over the place for anyone to want to invest their time into it. I was in Engineering school at the time, doing the bare minimum to scrape by with most of the courses. Then a friend started doing her master\u2019s  (she\u2019s a bit older than me) on sexual fetisches and that lead to alot of interesting conversations about the brain. I mentioned this to a guy I was dating at the time and he handed me, the minds eye, a book by Daniel Dennet. I talked my way into the neurobiology and cognitive neuropsychology courses at the Medical university and I think it was the first time I really put any serious effort into studiying. I was completely obsessed.</span>\n\n<span>Obviously alot of stuff was going on, I was living with a very self-destructive friend who I had to to cut off after they threw snakes down my mailbox (yes, they did). And the final rush of the University program was up ahead with classmates finishing their degrees and heading off for stellar careers with me feeling very sorry for myself and very aware of the lack of any sellable practical skills after the DAM fiasco. So I did just that, felt sorry for myself and threw a full on tantrum in a computer lab at Uni. That set of a cascade of events I can\u2019t really get into here but it ended up with me landing my first grown-up paid gig post college. Not a job, but a paid gig devising and implementing my own great project in a very hierarchical organisation with lots of strange rules designed to keep wildcards like myself out. And it was a position that wasn\u2019t there for me to fill, I didn\u2019t go looking for it. I think I was lucky to some extent. Just having the right mix of non-mainstream experiences and skills, a flamboyant personality and being at the right place at the right time. But the place was what is considered an elite university. And a large chunk of the reason I could afford to be there and also fail at all kinds of experiments is because of the conditions we have in Sweden: university is free of charge for citizens and you are entitles to take a loan and grant from the state to Study if you are accepted into any university course or program. Im eternally grateful that it exists and hope it never ever goes away so others can have the same space.</span>\n\n<span>Back to money. The experience living on an ice-breaker with 12 lovely, warm people changed something for me- being in a nurturing environment where most never had any money taught me a few things about myself and about what makes me happy. It also taught me that you need to invest either money, or alot of time into creating a good social environment for yourself. You have to be engaged and excite others about it in either case, but you need time and or money. And if you\u2019re working a dayjob, the time part goes out the window...and so does money because let\u2019s face it, unless you\u2019re an investment banker you\u2019re never really going to make enough money to do what I want to do. So my way is to try to put alot of time and engagement into creating events that people I want to be surrounded by and learn from, will get excited enough to attend and that everyone else values enough to fund.</span>\n\n<span>And finally the lynch mob. I\u2019m still terrified of it. Even more so after learning more about the way the brain and the world are wired. But I\u2019ve decided to try to do something about it. It\u2019s really a nuisance because I am no do-gooder- and I\u2019m still trying to figure out how to build a life where I have access to the people and things that make me feel good (great food, nice clothes, big home with big windows and high cieling etc). My brain is wired to equate money with security but my mind, aided along by my husbands optimism, has done the thinking and come to the conclusions that my access to all of those things I care about is determined by changes that happen on a global scale. And my mind also knows that unless I get in the game and try to affect change so that life doesn\u2019t completely suck for those of us who are in the proverbial middle class, there\u2019s a node missing in the needed network. And my heart knows that someone somewhere on the other side of the plane, maybe a cousin of someone I went to school with in one of the 10 countries I grew up in, is paying for me to live this life. And it tells me that our fates are connected that cousin and I and that in the big picture it\u2019s way better if we\u2019re both ok- if that means I have a little less of the great food that\u2019s ok.</span>\n\n</div>", "created_at": "2011-12-13 12:02:16", "updated_at": "2019-03-07 17:15:21.490553", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1424, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32052, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1276, "post_number": 24, "raw": "<b>Liste des effets</b>\n\nJ'avoue que rendu l\u00e0, l'exercice commence \u00e0 \u00eatre pas mal abstrait, et j'ai de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 imaginer la suite des choses.

It is also used to get children outside and connect them to their environments.\n\nWe will do a demo workshop on fly fishing, involving a local school and participants of the festival can also join. The group will go to a body of water close by and learn fly fishing techniques. The fly fishing is also a way into learning about environment, physics, biology and your surroundings.\n\nThe session can be supplemented with citizen science research on water quality, through biotic index (measuring water quality through the type and amount of living organisms in the water) or microbiotic activity (measuring the type and amount of micro-organisms).\n\nAs the group will be diverse and there are multiple things to do, we\u2019ll work with a rotation, so that everyone gets to do a little of everything.\n\nThe session should not be limited to the festival for its impact. It would be good if this format can be reused by other schools. Communicate about it with pictures, videos, etc. beforehand, during and after so that there is a lot of documentation: a mini website.\n\nWhat we still need for the session:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>People with fishing experience to teach casting techniques</li>\n\n<li>People who want to facilitate the citizen science experiments</li>\n\n<li>Fishing rods and reels to borrow</li>\n\n<li>Help with online presence</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nAn issue I experienced is finding opportunities to let people know that what we are doing.

Word2Vec captures, from a corpus of text, the semantic representation of a word in a space made of the other words composing the text. It is actually a bit more sophisticated but in the end, every word has a representation in an n-dimensional space, and close words that tend to appear often together in the corpus are supposedly placed close together in this high dimensional space. This allows for a word to be associated with its nearest neighbors in the high dimensional space, forming a sort of semantic vector representative of the word. This embedding allows vector comparison, such as, in a large Wikipedia corpus, the vector that differentiates Paris from France, should correspond to Berlin if placed from Germany. In that sense, the context from which you train your network has a strong impact on the semantic representation of the word. For example, <em>football</em> trained on a British corpus should refer to other vocabulary related to the sport known as <em>soccer</em> (such as <em>corner</em>, <em>goalkeeper</em>, and <em>champions league</em>) but trained on an American corpus, we would have a different contextual vector (such as <em>quarterback</em>, <em>drop kick</em>, or <em>super bowl</em>).\n\nWe launched only a small exploratory experiment to see how we could apply this technique to investigate the Opencare conversations. Due to the many languages, typos, etc., this experiment highlights the heavy requirement for advanced NLP pre-processing to improve the results. Then after training the network, we can explore a few queries, to see the representation network. The interesting insight would then be to find unexpected word association. The last step of our experiment is to construct the network of nearest neighbors words and see how communities/paths would form.\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\">\u00a0</h2>\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-71687baa-f785-f2ef-3382-b2b8f051b6cb\">Requirements </b></h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-71687baa-f785-f2ef-3382-b2b8f051b6cb\">Download and compile</b></h3>\n\n<a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/\">https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/</a>\n\nYou can copy the content of \u00a0<a href=\"https://github.com/renoust/opencare-data-documentation/word2vec/\">https://github.com/opencarecc/Masters-of-Networks-5/tree/master/word2vec</a>\u00a0into the word2vec folder you just created.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-71687baa-f785-f2ef-3382-b2b8f051b6cb\">Details</b></h3>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><em>word2vec/scripts</em>: scripts to run different steps</li>\n\n<li><em>word2vec/data</em>: processing data</li>\n\n<li><em>word2vec/graphs</em>: Tulip graphs (ready to run)</li>\n\n<li><em>word2vec/images</em>: Images for this post</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\"><strong>The input data</strong></h3>\n\nThe raw Edgeryders\u2019 OpenCare conversations: <em>data/mon5.bcp</em>\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\">\u00a0</h2>\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-71687baa-f785-f2ef-3382-b2b8f051b6cb\">Preprocessing</b></h2>\n\nQuick and dirty tricks to produce a ready-to-process dataset: <em>scripts/clean_mon.py</em>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Removes web addresses and HTML code</li>\n\n<li>Corrects capitalization: <em>aWordWithCapitalizationIssue</em> -&gt; <em>a Word With Capitalization Issu</em></li>\n\n<li>Removes non-letter characters (actually it also removes accents etc.)</li>\n\n<li>Removes English stopwords and words of length &lt;= 3 letters</li>\n\n<li>Lowercases the words for better comparison</li>\n\n<li>Stems the words (to extract roots for plural and conjugated form removal), with the Porter Stemmer, and use the most occurring form as representative of the class: \u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><em>learn -&gt; learn (2)</em></li>\n\n<li><em>learning -&gt; learn (10)</em></li>\n\n<li><em>learnt -&gt; learn (5)</em></li>\n\n<li>\u2192 uses <em>learning</em> for all instances of <em>learn</em><em>, </em><em>learnt</em><em>, learning</em></li>\n\n</ul></li>\n\n<li>\tCreate classes of words with very close Levenshtein distance (remove some letter inversion misspelling) -- currently deactivated due to possible delicate confusion (e.g. association of <em>controversial</em> and <em>uncontroversial</em>)</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nIdeally, we need to use a spell checker like <em>pyenchant</em>, and check the language first to find the right dictionary to use etc\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Finally we oversample the text a 100 times because the dataset is too small.</li>\n\n<li>The output data is a big text stored in data/mon5.cln</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\">\u00a0</h2>\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-71687baa-f785-f2ef-3382-b2b8f051b6cb\">Neural Network</b></h2>\n\nTrain the network:<em> scripts/word2vec_train_mon.sh\u00a0</em>\n\nWe threshold the min word occurrence to 101, due to oversampling\n\n\u00a0\n\n<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-71687baa-f785-f2ef-3382-b2b8f051b6cb\">A few example queries:</b>\n\n<table>\n\n<colgroup>\n\n<col width=\"*\">\n\n<col width=\"*\">\n\n</colgroup>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td>\n\n<img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/IHW6h_Pg3BOsT0bYs7tLgR8_tB7P8GJ3em5xr9-u6ZGLyDM71LsFJm335BVkwcb7YW5L_lcaYMoUcVZfGNLSRr_XI5X9CYOqmdXvUdb6fmTRDowe0-6Y7rpbAvrAxxmoflt-U_9K\">\n\n</td>\n\n<td>\n\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4_OgBDTflhf9-g04L14XSvoTXMHanjfG9imM02uV-j5O8aSSzwNn7rua8Jj-h0TSsiQ-LyG6KQaDAReBrRRhtMRzeW2zQX7_oAn1VB13NTkYnMmwOb7PNAdKawrWAj2B4uq7oCs-\">\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td>\n\n<img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/oEu1lydlUQGusLQXFvKGjVBukkmF0h_zu1A0SjtOCygOhk0qTK2dkYEwuilYhbGNNFyPeteilSP-K8WbXpDrcEiO-UsgxNjzaXzNg0aUjfMg47bBqYBFGAQbzwjuES4Bs8lMO07w\">\n\n</td>\n\n<td>\n\n<img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/cE_QWnRmaAGJo47k9AyrDF9splU-xMEVwXioAwFR28_bbaDNvD5fp1aLrAc8-49MeoqkKDzHt2y06GgEiMi6kEctqPA2EdP4J3dLsMZuN5E-xpFrVW6WmbRgIpiBQl7938kyGKAf\">\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td>\n\n<img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/2VhZyJvB5uahjivgFq5Z5jGMyoGIrn3lmUF7PFSj8uID8G4KdpAuidcV85lh96uaaSArjJcbqjgxaEQ_-RdIdiEpInwEY2vfnE_hApxk7gswdx5mCC9d0dd5oek20x_zPyb1zmx4\">\n\n</td>\n\n<td>\n\n<img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/TlocbkunXd486TJDfgXRYuzHfcjLm4hamYWGo2nk97ht9S4cJGA4R_B1jqnfe6JNb4ecTw13QUn709DU_x3peHjZyK_ui7S9V-BjR6TY9HefWhvrreAx8-onxUUrJw5fePv3UsXj\">\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\nBonus: the file <em>script/demo-analogy.sh</em> allows to try testing analogies (such as<em> Paris-&gt;France = x-&gt;Germany, x=Berlin</em>).

If you need a server or help setting this up, we can put it on our edgeryders.eu server. **Edit:** In 20117 Ushahidi Crowdmap is no longer the first choice in 2017. I recommend OSM uMap now \u00ad\u2013 [details here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/id/6704).</li>\n\n<li><strong>Set up a hotline phone number.</strong> This is something that was not done here in Nepal, but from our experience with how volunteers coordinate, this would be a great tool. Because volunteers \"in the field\" can't be bothered to do structured data input or query a database, so other volunteers should take on that task and provide a simple voice interface to the others.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Just do the work!</strong> Zero-overhead action is the beauty of volunteer-driven disaster relief :) It is also the main point how it differs from the long-term approaches by big NGOs and disaster relief professionals. Volunteers save much more by not having meetings and plannings than they waste by doing the wrong work at times. Volunteers also do not wait for the right tools, they just use what they have at hand. Solutions will pop up while the work is ongoing, but probably not before. A great example, found by <a href=\"/u/dipti_sherchan\">@Dipti_Sherchan</a>, is <a href=\"/t/organic-magic-conversation-with-milan-rai-part-1/4478\">something Milan Rai said</a>: \"We only had two gardening tools but our aim was to build 100 toilets and none of us had even broken a stick!\".</li>\n\n<li><strong>Volunteer coordination efforts should agree on role separation.</strong> In some cases, this happens organically (here in Nepal, there would be one Facebook group per district for example). In some cases, it needs a decision. But don't call a meeting to decide it, just do it in one phone call.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Pull-based model of information flow.</strong> What worked well here is that responsibilities were organized (informally) in such a way that the person wanting to do some new relief work would have to call or otherwise contact other relevant groups working in the same topic or geographical areas, in order to avoid duplication of efforts, and in order to collaborate around logistics etc. where meaningful. Initiatives do not have a responsibility to publish or report back what they do. (The hotline operators however would want to call them and collect that information to publish it online.)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Needs assessment: don't underestimate it.</strong> We had some cases where villages received relief supplies that were \"nice to have\" but not needed there. This does not exactly harm anyone, but at least in the early days after a disaster there might be high-priority tasks to do instead. Good assessment options for volunteer-driven disaster responses are: (1) asking a trustable local contact person from the affected area, (2) going to the area and doing a quick damage and need assessment (go around, pin down names and what  they need \u2026 don't start immediately with distributing stuff, it should reach those who need it most).</li>\n\n<li><strong>A new role for funders!</strong> NGOs and international organizations looking for \"partners on the ground\" to do the relief work have a new, uber-efficient option, now that volunteer-driven disaster response is widespread: contributing to the small-scale crowdfunding campaigns of these local initiatives. If they can show documentation from what they started by themselves, it will often be enough to gauge how much money to entrust them with. Collecting these fundraising campaigns and evaluating such \"trustability stages of collaboration\" for such initiatives and communicating them to potential funders could be one more very useful volunteer activity that I have not yet seen. Funders for the local initatives can also be \"normal\" people from the same and other countries who want to help, but want to give directly because they don't like the overhead costs and hard-to-understand scale of the \"traditional\" disaster responders. We've seen such donations happen a lot in Nepal. Also think of the \"diaspora\" community as potential funders; Nepal has a big one, Georgia has also one as far as I know. In the case of Nepal for example, the <a href=\"http://helpnepal.net/\">HELP Nepal Network</a> collected &gt;500,000 USD in donations, mostly from the diaspora community. That was however the largest volunteer-driven fundraiser that I know of.</li>\n\n</ol>", "created_at": "2015-06-14 17:04:05", "updated_at": "2017-08-29 06:36:58.874333", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 976, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 16.0, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856, 8, 2201, 3, 3402, 2551], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7634, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1398, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Go on!</b>\n\nHello Jody, nice to hear from you.\n\nThere has been few mission reports at Edgeryders from the \\#Occupy spheres, well, not as much as I would have liked to see, therefore, go ahead!, inform us about what goes on in your communities and country, and how citizens are being mobilised and engaged in an occupy movement.\n\nBy the way, I like the colorful illustration, how the circles turn into images that look like people pulling their hair out!\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-12 14:47:46", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:44.600888", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 89, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7658, "user_id": 3362, "topic_id": 708, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Personalized medicine</b>\n\nI'm very intrigued by this idea: \"Considering the increasingly ubiquitous 3D technology, many of the medical tools can be soon printed cheaply by anyone.

For most of human history innovating has been an activity of last resort: human communities have innovated mostly when their back was to the wall, and they just could not make do with the old ways. Over and above the rhetoric, it seems that - altough for different reasons - this is still the case. Everybody wants innovation; everybody acknowledges that failure is a critical part of innovating; but very few people are up for risking their own money or their standing in their home buraucracy to endorse an innovative idea.\n\nThe Silicon Valley-type innovators have tried to work around the problem by leveraging greed. If they can show some probability of a very large financial gain, they can sometimes get venture capitalists to fund them: in this case, the investment is more like a lottery, implying a relatively small loss in case the new company folds but a fabulously large gain in case it is successful. With social innovation that is generally not possible: most successful cases are cases in which some money is made, financial sustainability is achieved, but not a lot of wealth is generated. Success is measured by social impact: you make a dent into a social problem, you are successful. If you put yourself on the line for a new social innovation idea, and then that idea is successful, you stand at most to make a reputational gain. It is not a very big incentive for making what you perceive to be a risky move.\n\nIn a different Edgeryders post, Vinay wrote about \"thinking outside the fundable sphere\". It is a different perspective onto the same phenomenon: the more innovative the idea, the more difficult is it to support it. People are asked to innovate, but innovative ideas are rarely backed. This is understandable; I don't blame it on venture capitalists, bank managers, government agencies directors or evaluators. They react to incentives. I do blame it onto policy makers, because they are supposed to design incentive systems. The ones in place now, I would argue, are not doing a very good job.\n\nInnovation rhetoric is no substitute for a well-designed set of incentives. If we want people to innovate, we need to be ready to enable them to do so. It is difficult, but it can be done. And it starts with the recognition of what you, Alberto, are saying here.\n\n", "created_at": "2011-12-26 12:38:37", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:45.428429", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 418, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7838, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1236, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Human relationship and the economy</b>\n\n<em>\"<span>It\u2019s impossible to have good relationships unless you have an economic system that supports them.

Jeru realized that when elements of Vipassana were combined with deep rhythmic and consciously connected breath, it could bring a participant into the recognition of Oneness without having to sit still in silent meditation for hours a day.

Purtroppo non capisco cosa vuol dire \"esplodere le potenzialit\u00e0 delle linee di prodotto del Sistema della Domiciliarit\u00e0 relative agli interventi educativi e assistenziali\". Preparati a dare qualche spiegazione se cerchiamo di suscitare dibattito internazionale su questi punti!\u00a0\n\nFare cambiare le logiche a soggetti che hanno gi\u00e0 le loro \u00e8 sempre difficile. Nello spirito di opencare, mi viene da suggerire che potreste pensare di appoggiarvi a soggetti diversi, che hanno\u00a0<em>gi\u00e0</em>\u00a0le logiche \"sharing\" che vi interessano. In pratica, questo significa cercare e sostenere i cosiddetti devianti positivi (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_deviance), cio\u00e8 gente che ha gi\u00e0 cominciato a sviluppare soluzioni come quelle che vorreste promuovere.\n\nMi ricordo che qualche anno fa leggevo di un caso a Firenze: una signora immigrata, con molto tempo, amante dei bambini, avevo montato un servizio in cui i genitori le lasciavano i loro bambini, e lei li faceva giocare, faceva con loro piccole attivit\u00e0, etc. Sembrave una buona idea: in Italia le scuole per l'infanzia servono solo una parte piccola della popolazione, e sono molto care. In Emilia il costo pieno (senza profitto) \u00e8 stimato a 700 EUR al mese per bambino. E invece, le cooperative sociali che in Toscana gestiscono questi servizi l'hanno denunciata e fatta chiudere: mancato rispetto delle normative regionali.\u00a0Un approccio basato sui devianti positivi avrebbe invece concluso che a Firenze servono scuole dell'infanzia basic, e creato uno spazio per la signora e per le altre persone come lei.\u00a0\n\nLa metodologia di opencare \u00e8 molto adatta a trovare i devianti positivi. Si tratterebbe di fare un affondo su Milano, cercando le iniziative su cui la gente si sta automobilitando; queste sono le cose che servono davvero. E il bello dei devianti positivi \u00e8 che, per definizione, sono gi\u00e0 nelle logiche che vi interessano.\u00a0\n\nUltima cosa: c'\u00e8 un numero chiaramente sbagliato nel post:\u00a0383.221 donne, di cui\u00a0372.998 divorziate? Impossibile. Il totale delle donne dovrebbe essere sul mezzo milione abbondante, a spanna.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-01-18 05:49:27", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:47.228432", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 363, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8163, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 4515, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Our first supporter!</b>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://nadia.cre8tives.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/95/2015/06/DSC02727-e1434096654302.jpg\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto;\">\n\nWhile on the train to Berlin yesterday, somehow a fun and creative conversation started amongst some of us passengers.

Many years ago I got involved in a certain movement but got disillusioned and left because of the dynamics that didn't work for me: lots of guys making a lot of noise but little substance drowning out the softer more timid people like myself who were thinking about alternatives, solutions...you know- what happens after we make the political change we want to see happen? What do we want to build, what do we want our lives to look like? And so my motivation for getting involved in Edgeryders is that I wanted a space like that, that would allow me to think with others about how to build the future we deserve, based on practical experiences of what work for others- less focus on the ideological discourse. And so I am curious about what it is about the position expressed by Eric that you share? How did it happen, did you try other paths or approaches towards affecting change and if so which ones do you think work from your experiences?

Maybe that's the missing part for how the idea of social centers could take root in Nepal?\n\nI assume the need for among the student community comes from the fact that most students are far from home in Nepal, coming from villages or other cities to study in Kathmandu? Also, I'm not sure how students live in Kathmandu and how much they usually have for rent.

Recently [Ariane] left <a href=\"/t/innovation-and-work/1012/4\">this comment</a> on one of the posts about a discussion which is the red thread tying a lot of what we are exploring in Edgeryders. It reminded me of the importance of storytelling and content curation in supporting one another, and others in bridging the widening gap between the need to make a living and the need to make meaning:\n\n<blockquote>\n\nI feel that intellectual frameworks are good but I'd make a strong plea for\u00a0emotional frameworks and stories.. Even when we are trying to capture the attention and heart-minds of policymakers, legislators, politicians, it's not data or rationality that persuade\u00a0so much as emotions/morals/values. What's the P2P guide (I'm late to the conversations, I know, I apologize)- I mean how would it work, how do people access it? How about we partner with ARTE and other TV channels to do a reality TV on The Good Life (Meaningful, fulfilling, contributing value &amp; getting rewarded for that). ?\n\n</blockquote>\n\nPerhaps what Ariane and I could bring to the table is more of a focus on the content curation and storytelling aspects. As well as thinking about how to reach and engage many more people through the video materail produced during \\#LOTE3. Perhaps we could come up with a nice format that could fit nicely into the <a href=\"/t/social-capital-for-social-ventures/314/the-unmonasterians-cookbook-recipes-for-bridging-the-gap-between\">unMonasterian's Cookbook</a>?

L'idea \u00e8 che i veterani aiutino gli aspiranti pastai nella realizzazione di un piatto 100% lucano, dagli ingredienti alla ricetta.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPer poter definire la dinamica dell'evento e gli aspetti logistici proponiamo di organizzare un incontro \u00a0<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/up/search\" id=\"yui_3_7_2_94_1376548994885_158\" style=\"color: blue; text-decoration: underline !important; cursor: text !important;\">video-chat.</a>\u00a0Vi prego quindi, se siete interessati, di compilare il questo<span>\u00a0\u00a0</span><a href=\"http://doodle.com/957fcwe4xc8n64u8#table\" id=\"yui_3_7_2_94_1376548994885_206\" style=\"color: blue; text-decoration: underline !important; cursor: text !important; background-color: transparent;\">doodle</a><span>, scegliendo la preferenza per il giorno e l'ora, in modo che verr\u00e0 selezionat\u00e0 data piu' gettonata.</span>\n\nSe ricevete questa mail \u00e8 perch\u00e8 qualcuno vi ha citato come possibile organizzatore.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBuona giornata a tutti e a presto!\n\n\u00a0\n\nValentina\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nGoof morning materani and edgeryders,\n\n\u00a0\n\nA you know from the 29th of October to the 3rd of November In Matera will take place\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.unmonastery.eu/\" id=\"yui_3_7_2_94_1376548994885_134\" style=\"color: blue; text-decoration: underline !important; cursor: text !important;\">\"Living un the Edge\"</a>\u00a0at Unmonastery.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe event being open to all kind of porposals I made my own one and hope to make it effective with the help of edgeryders and the community of Matera. \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nMy idea was to organise a huge PASTA PARTY, that means making pasta all together (no matter sex or age) and later on eat it all together.

I find it applicable to Egypt, since so many development focused agencies, as well as the government, seem to equate development with job creation!\u00a0\n\nI disagree with the Hyper-Schumpetrian ideology hypothesis, however. It is true that all the meetings we had support the idea of entrepreneurship for job creation and that the ecosystem in Egypt is thriving and growing. Yet, this purposefully ignores the heavy concentration of capital in the country outside of the agricultural and handicraft sectors. Recent events such as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt_Economic_Development_Conference\">Egypt Economic Development Conference</a>\u00a0show the governments heavy commitment towards Big Business and foreign multinationals. Authorities such as GAFI (General Authority for Investment) provide easy access to the Egyptian market for foreign investors, yet such gains are not as realised for local entrepreneurs.\u00a0<span>Further, Egyptian economists generally agree on observing a crowding out phenomena of SME's in\u00a0</span><span>favour</span><span>\u00a0of larger enterprises and the\u00a0</span><span>government</span><span>\u00a0in financial markets and access to capital. \u00a0</span>\n\nI do agree very much with the assertion of the <b>belief\u00a0</b>in\u00a0job creation as the cure-all, yet high level support for true entrepreneurship/distruption is lacking.

Could you recommend some readings on this movement? I'll also do a search.\n\nFinally, what will definitely stick with me after reading your take on this is:\n\n<em>A great quality of these networked movements is that they're simply platforms empowering the nodes that participate in them, rather than an institutionalized \"movement\" with a set of demands.</em>\n\nThis is pretty much the idea behind Edgeryders :) What participants write and the strategies they employ or goals they have in their lives outside the community are pooled in, available to others as well and with zero transaction costs.

At the moment I'm living in Milan, but every week I spend some time in Rome and in Bologna.\n\nReally interesting post, thanks! Full of insights, I jumped several times through a stream of articles during the reading :) .\n\nI do agree that until we figure out how to create valid alternatives, current platforms are indispensable.. there's no wayback... That's why we need to act to create a fairer digital economy where interests of people are central instead of profit, some of this platforms are almost impossible to create an alternative to, others I believe not.\n\nCompetition between a non-extractive and an extractive platform is somehow like David against Golia.\n\nI think the key is to <strong>pick the right platform</strong> and to <strong>craft the perfect strategy</strong> that enhances intrinsic and extrinsic motivation for the users.\n\nFor some reason (community-driven, aggregation platform, P2P are ordinary people, it produce lots of wealth by unlocking unused resources) I see Airbnb as the most suitable.\n\nFor the strategy, the only real competitive advantage is, in the end, that % that get subtracted to every transaction.\n\nThe % needed to merely run a platform is always much lower than the one taken, lots of this money are used for advertising, paying managers, and the majority of it become profit (this is true for platforms that have a solid business model ).\n\nIt's how this subtle but substantial amount of money is used in an alternative way that could make the difference.\n\nBasically the money that is redistribute helps the platform to grow and\u00a0it lower the\u00a0Custumer Acquisition Cost in a platform that don't require a huge amount of users to reach the critical mass.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-06 18:40:30", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:01.243145", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 320, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [10494], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11122, "user_id": 3417, "topic_id": 526, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Hi there @Alberto! Thanks for reading -and watching :)\n\nI\u2019m glad the idea (and the movement) of Food Sovereignty is spreading! And I will grant you that becoming self sustainable and autonomous is no easy feet. On the other hand, everything is as simple or as hard as we make it out to be. In nature everything is connected and everything functions through viable, long-term, symbiotic relationships. In this new model of a new society based on solidarity, collaboration, and fairness we are trying to create and advocate, I really do not think that anything can be achieved without partnerships. Nothing in nature works alone, why should we? Hence concepts like CSA are strong representatives of this new type of communities we need to evolve into. It also stands to reason that no-one can know everything and have experience (let alone expertise) in every field; by combining forces with someone that knows how to farm we stand to gain lots more than if go at it on our own. So I would say find local farmers to source your food from and co-produce together.\n\nFood Sovereignty and Agroecology are political matters at heart -hence the (obvious) connection with governments and policy makers -as you correctly pointed out. What \u2018we the people\u2019 fail to recognize is that \u2018that\u2019 (governors and policy-makers) should be us! We need to play a more active role where our livelihoods and our present and future are concerned! So we need to find ways (and where there isn\u2019t one, create it) to push for changes in policy, in the way our affairs are run (and whom by). This is why pushing for the creation of Food Policy Councils is an idea I stand by, and this is why one of the main pillars of the FoodSov movement is related to this specific sector -ie political lobbying and advocacy. After all, the word 'eco' in greek means house, the place where one lives, and we can't be proper (agro)ecologists without giving enough attention into how this house is run!\n\nBut FoodSov and Agroecology are also about being practical and hands-on, hence the phrase about growing food and not writing manifestos. 70% of the world's food is produced -contrary to mass belief, by small farmers around the world. We are an active movement, we put food on our table every day, and that's no small thing. We just need to realise the importance and value of that, and unite with our natural allies -e.g. the producers and bringers of our food and health (for as a wise farmer once said 'we are not in the business of producing mere food! I like to say that what I do for a living is cultivate people's health').\n\n", "created_at": "2016-12-16 06:48:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:04.396869", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 476, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 6.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [7761], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10956, "user_id": 40, "topic_id": 1745, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Adding the voices of the commons community</b>\n\nYes Lynne, a new territory to explore and conquer?

Very broadly, we want an action based strategy that channels analytics into insight and action. In the corporate world, this is driven primarily by a motivation to gain insight\u00a0into how a product or service is being perceived\u00a0and to then shape a marketing strategy accordingly to sell more products or services.\u00a0For content publishers, it is generally about gaining insight into what content is being shared and discussed in order to more accurately predict successful content, which in turn can be monetised through advertising and affiliate marketing. From my early experience here, Edgeryders is positioned outside of these spheres;\u00a0our goal should be bringing the most salient, conversational\u00a0material to the forefront and highlighting not only the content but the community practices that give rise to such content. Hence, the message being conveyed is not simply \u2018read this\u2019, but identify and engage with the platform that has produced this content.\u00a0\n\nBased on the last ad campaign, I'm not convinced Facebook alone is the best approach unless there is something actionable within the network. My impression is that most people interact on Facebook in a self enclosed environment\u00a0(watching embedded videos, commenting and sharing posts, liking pages..), while Twitter is more conducive to leaving the site\u00a0(although the company has been trying to change this too). I think mailing lists are highly effective and targeted, and much closer to reaching a longer attention span\u00a0as they offer something more\u00a0personalised than link sharing.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-16 09:27:39", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:08.118480", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 294, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [9835], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12111, "user_id": 3326, "topic_id": 474, "post_number": 3, "raw": "thanks noemi for your feedback. it's hard to give advice on the right governance structure and conflict management. in a project like ours it's still an ongoing learning or de-learning process, especially dealing with formal and informal mechanism and forms of communication and decision making.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-06-15 22:06:19", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:09.219818", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 53, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [10375], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12143, "user_id": 3374, "topic_id": 6290, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Great Explanation</b>\n\n@Noemi, Sorry for the slow response, I've been traveling with limited internet access.

All actors/users can create their profiles for free\n\n2. Create their own galleries and make their works available\n\n3. Follow and be followed by others\n\n4. Receive notifications\n\n5. Give money donations\n\n6. Comment and review the contributions of the community\n\n7. Disseminate the contributions of others\n\n8. Propose exchanges for the works exposed\n\n9. Send direct messages\n\n10. Evaluate the contributions made by others\n\n11. Take part in the decision making of the platform and Ampliative Art\n\n12. Propose new ideas and discuss existing ones\n\n13. Audit the accounts and movements of the organization\n\n14. Increase their community reputation according their contributions\n\n15. Contribute in the construction of the platform and Ampliative Art\n\n16. Check their community reputation and their history\n\n17. Receive distributed income according their community reputation\n\nFor the first phase, I proposed to build all those features which allow actors/users to interact amongst them as an alternative art procedure (features from 1 to 10), and integrate a democratic decision-making tool as <a href=\"http://democracyos.org/\">DemocracyOS</a> or <a href=\"http://loomio.org/\">Loomio</a> (11, 12).\n\nDue I know starting the development of a web platform is not an easy job being a non-profit project and committed with open art without investors nor web developers involved, I\u2019ve thought it would be helpful for the project to develop a manual process as starting point. I mean, follow a kind of Lean methodology with manual process, plus the collaboration of a team of people involved.\n\nFor that, I\u2019ve thought we could start developing a Wordpress template that allows actors to interact with the most of the features referred. In this way, I could make the initial development of this site using Wordpress, and we will just need some help in some issues on the site development and in the creation of the community (I mean, communication, copy of the landing page, social media, artist curation\u2026)\n\nThe best template I\u2019ve found for this challenge is <a href=\"http://xhunt.io/\">http://xhunt.io/</a>. This is a template for make projects a la <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com\">Product Hunt</a> which would allow these interesting features:\n\n- Users could upload art works (one image), add description, tags and a link to the site\u2019s work\n\n- Upvote these art works for increase their visibility\n\n- Comment, review and share these works\n\n- Create Collections of these works (so users could curate works by the themes they want)\n\n- Follow/following\n\n- Send private messages\n\n- Be notified and check their activity\n\nIn this case, we wouldn\u2019t host all the art works, the users just would use the links for redirect to the artist\u2019s sites. This idea would let us follow the features commented for the phase 1, with the exception of money donations, for which we would require a web developer who could help us on this issue and others related. But I will talk in more detail about all of this in next posts so I don't want to bother you.\n\nOn the implementation of the next phases (community reputation + income distribution + collaborating site) we will require specialist who will be able to implement all of this being that we are using a Wordpress template.\u00a0\n\nSo summarizing, initially it would be some kind of Product Hunt for engaged art with some features for allow reward the works linked and increase their visibility, while we facilitate a way where artists, art mediators and art enthusiasts can generate a community for empower social, engaged art.\n\nI just would like to know your opinion on this idea.\n\nFor more info on the project check out the <a href=\"/t/ampliative-art/611\">Description</a> page or <a href=\"http://www.ampliativeart.org\">www.ampliativeart.org</a>\u00a0\n\nAny comment, critique, idea, proposal or hello also welcome :))\n\n", "created_at": "2015-11-05 22:25:36", "updated_at": "2017-10-08 20:28:42.924112", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 766, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12205, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4827, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Absolutely!</b>\n\nActually, here is a nice variant on the community call: we could do a physical one in Brussels, with people far away logging in through Skype/Hangout. <a href=\"/u/kiravde\">@KiraVde</a>, you, I and hopefully <a href=\"/u/nadia\">@Nadia</a>\u00a0(others? <a href=\"/u/thomas_goorden\">@Thomas_Goorden</a>\u00a0maybe?) can be here in person.

Good point. We do need not to take anything for granted.\n\nIn-degree: the number of edges that connect to the ego. In your example, the ego is Alberto. Edgesense is telling you that Alberto has received comments from 250 different users. That, of course, does not mean he has received 250 comments, because each user is counted only once. If a new user leaves Alberto 10 comments, Alberto's in-degree will become 250 + 1 = 251; it will NOT become 250 + 10 = 260. This is because the in-degree is the number of edges connecting to a node, and in Edgesense edges represent unique relationships. You can think of comments as being stacked on top of each other to give rise to an edge. As you see from the green pane in the top right, Edgeryders has over 4,000 edges made of over 15,000 comments. The difference between the number of edges and the number of comments is accounted for by the definition of edge (=&gt; unique relationships) that I mentioned.\n\nOut-degree: the number of edges that the ego connects to. In your example, the ego is Alberto. Edgesense is telling you that Alberto has left comments <s>from</s> to 391 different users. That, of course, does not mean he has left 391 comments, because each user is counted only once. For example, I am already connected to you, <a href=\"/u/hazem\">@Hazem</a>: I am now leaving you a comment (because this comment is left to a parent comment, <a href=\"/t/edgesense-compile-first-set-of-questions-we-want-to-answer/4136/4\">this</a>, authored by you). However, this does not give rise to a new edge, because we are already connected. You can check this by looking for yourself in the graph and checking that the node representing me is connected to the node representing you by two edges, one for \"me talking to you\" and another for \"you talking to me\".\n\nSo, your last question is meaningless. Alberto in-interacted (=&gt; was left comments by) with 250 other users; and out-interacted (=&gt; left comments to) with 391 other users. Some of these will be the same users, of course! This was done through 250 incoming edges and 391 outgoing edges.

Although some of my dermatologists I've seen plenty of times over years - they just kept on trying things on me, instead of looking for some other reasons why their treatment didn't work (probably they didn't address the issue at its core).

It turns out in Poland each doctor is given a number of tests he can prescribe to people: blood, sugar, more sophisticated ones. BUT, if the doesn't spend them all, he gets PAID for each test he didn't give out.

I've found some of the comments below to be helpful and insightful, but some to be problematic.\n\nThere is certainly a strong link through poetry and literature to this idea. I've recently been reading a lot of Thomas Mann and it's almost the entire structure on which his work is predicated. There seems to have been a sensibility that was propagrated in the late 1800s -early 1900s European intellectual/artisan culture around 'bohemianism' or latterly 'bourgouise'. I think in some senses it emerges out of a combination of Romanticism (in poetry and visual art) and it's opposite reaction,\u00a0Realism (in painting and literature) and the beginnings of the sentimental nostalagia-tinged\u00a0classical music of people like\u00a0Verdi and the German/Austrians like Liszt, Mendelsohn.\u00a0\n\nThe 'struggling artist' becomes a trope, a series of hooks onto which musicians, writers and painters can hang their emotional responses to the world. The struggles of the artist can therefore\u00a0be equated to the struggles of the working, pastoral man and woman, who often during this period are the themes on which the artist work. c.f Beethoven's 6th, Robert\u00a0Burn's Poetry, Victor Hugo. Which becomes an important connection between the (usually rich, educated and entitled) artists and the philosophy of people like Rosseau and Locke who want to improve the human condition for all.\u00a0\n\nMore of a History of Art and Ideas response to the idea, and certainly not my final views on the subject, but i thought i'd add a bit more to this already in-depth post.\n\nAlso, worth having a quick read of this piece i found today:\u00a0http://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/public/literary-madness/\n\n", "created_at": "2016-11-24 10:35:57", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:15.881365", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 322, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 6.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [11235], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13621, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 4429, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>We had the same challenge</b>\n\nSome inspirations / remarks from our experience:\n\nIMHO, the bias introduced by transforming verbatim speech to third person is much bigger than the one by asking questions during an interview.

The passion makes it easier to invest in something, and once you have become good at something it becomes possible to get paid for it.\n\nThat's the theory at least.

It made it easier to price in the cost of the preserving process, and the cost of transportation.\n\nRather than the current notional monetary value, what about using the energy-cost of creating/processing of \"useful raw materials\"?\n\nThis would connect very nicely into the hardware side of things, as you'd be able to measure the values of physical objects, by measuring the amount of energy required to process the raw material.\n\nIn theory, recycled aluminium should be cheaper than aluminium produced from the raw bauxite, as it requires less energy to purify. As long as you can trace the source of the aluminium, you can trace the grade of the material, so you know what it's capable of being used for, and what it needs to be flavoured with, to change the current grade into the one you need.\n\nAdd in the constant flow of improvements in efficiency, and improvements in manufacturing technology, and a good basic standard of living will only get cheaper to achieve.\n\nBeing able to trace the materials flowing through the supply chain would also work as a way of measuring C02 generation and absorption.

This was one of the main rationales of the inventors club. Mutual self-defence and support. There's nothing more useful than a quiet conversation where you are told, \"Don't work with those people. Here's how they tried to rip me off...\"\n\nWhenever i see some of those initial symptoms that they mentioned, it pushes my buttons. Once burnt, twice shy.\n\nI didn't know about the NDA restrictions that were attached to some of the funding providers. Like i said before, i've not used those forms of funding before.

My comment about the for-profit co-working spaces. Whenever i went to have a look at them, they always put an emphasis on the interesting mix of people that you would meet there.\n\nWhilst nodding, smiling and continuing to listen, i always had in the back of my mind, a Billy Connolly sketch that he called \"Getting in touch with your Inner Welder\", where he was polite in dealing with pretentious middle-men, gate-keepers, and rip-off merchants, at the same time as feeling the hair and muscles sprouting from his arms, while he was thinking about ripping them limb from limb.\n\nI would end up thinking \"You want to use me as product to sell your space, and you want me to pay you for the priviledge...\" Though it always sounds better when you're roaring it loudly in a broad Glaswegian accent... :))\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe thing is when i worked in the corporate environment, the rip-off's had a different flavour, but the underlying taste was the same shit with a shinier spoon.\n\nThe current start-up craze is another example of the same thing. Yes, there are a lot of sincere people trying to start businesses and make the world a better place, but because i'm seeing it here in London, i'm running into a lot of money laundering schemes, ponzi scams, pump'n'dump schemes, and graft!\n\nOne horrifying but excellent example can be found on the Ribbon Farm website, <a href=\"http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/10/07/the-gervais-principle-or-the-office-according-to-the-office/\">http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/10/07/the-gervais-principle-or-the-office-according-to-the-office/</a>, where the writer,Venkat, manages to tie together the MacLeod <a href=\"http://gapingvoid.com/2004/06/27/company-hierarchy/\">Company hierarchy</a> with the <a href=\"http://miriadic.wikia.com/wiki/The_Five_Stages_of_Chaos\">Five Stages of Chaos</a> that every organisation goes through from genesis to decay.

So this only concerns a small set of users which means that, on our visualisation platform, the rest of the users are created \"on-the-fly\" when going through the posts, comments, tags and annotations. Those later users are only identified by a given id and their given name.</li>\n\n<li>The user view gives a lot of so-called \"personnal information\" (like facebook, twitter, website, location..., which I do not really consider worthy of interest and yet left anyway). On the other hand, every single piece of information we show in this view (or the others) is also available to everyone via the website. If somebody really wants it, a simple web sniffer will certainly achieve the same job in roughly 10 minutes. So, that being said, anonymising the views will only make such task a little bit harder.</li>\n\n<li>Finally, concerning the use of the user's name, no big secret there either considering anybody can infer who is a post or comment author based on the messages' titles. So unless we anonymise everything (like the message title, content and post date, and add some \"noise\" and \"salt\"), we do not truly anonymise anything.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nAbout the \"label\" field, it is more of a commodity used to indicate what information I want to pass as a visual label on the graph, so there is no need to use it in your case.\n\nTL;DR and to conclude: the user view does not contain essential information and is uncomplete so no need for it on Zenodo. The suppression of the \"user_name\" is a good idea but ultimately does not ensure anonymisation in this case.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-11-06 00:56:30", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:33.065599", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 349, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4624, "user_id": 2657, "topic_id": 4591, "post_number": 1, "raw": "I have come across the project \"DreamKyiv\" slightly after Maidan in 2014, and it's organizers were extremely active in trying to bring changes to the capital of Ukraine via control over the local government, over making reforms in urban development, over changes in administrative services in Kyiv. Initiative has been started during Euromaidan by two Kyiv residents - Ruslan Kavatsyuk and Maxim\u00a0Yakover. The idea is to help the inhabitants of Kyiv to regain citizen Kyiv turn power over the city. It is done via access to information on the city in a simple and understandable form.\n\nOne of the team members of DreamKyiv is Anna Ustenko, who is an editor on the DreamKiev online resource, aiming to point out various urban and social development present in Kiev.\n\nWhat are the main projects of the DreamKyiv initiative?\n\nThere were couple of projects that were initiated by the active group of volunteers:\n\n<strong>\"Structure\" </strong>\n\nIt is a project that is aimed to redo the urban environment into the beautification of the city. Project aims to redo two urban spaces: boulevard Vernadsky and Historical house \"Khrushov Dacha\" in the center of Kyiv. \u00a0Stucture is also a\u00a0a pop-up festival of the city, which works on to creating by the Kyiv people and others to \u00a0produce effective mechanisms such transformations.\u00a0\n\n<strong>Map \u00abDreamKyiv-control.\" The project is done on Google maps</strong>\n\nThe idea is to \u00a0establish \u00a0a website online edition of DreamKyiv interactive map of \u00a0two layers. The first layer - \"What local Kyiv deputies are doing\", the second layer - \"What citizens want.\"\n\nThe goal - to make contact, cooperation between citizens and city council member and thus stimulate the transformation to a more comfortable Kyiv city.\u00a0The social significance of the project is that the people of Kiev will receive convenient and efficient service to local government control and cooperation with it. As a result people of\u00a0Kyiv will know who their majoritarian MPs and will be able to control its activity / inactivity and keep in constant contact with him. This will quickly solve problems and areas of Kyiv citizens will give an opportunity to make at the next local elections a choice.\u00a0The project has two components: First\u00a0Layer \"What local Kyiv deputies are doing\"-\u00a0Interactive map of beautification projects that are implemented by Kyiv City council. This map enables citizens to supervise the work of deputies or omissions of his district. The map is aimed at \"transparency power\" of deputies and assistants. All new projects are moderated.\u00a0Each point on the map has: a brief description of the project's \u00a0done by deputy, object of the project, a reference to the deputy profile on Online DreamKyiv website, comments space. Another\u00a0Layer is \"What citizens want\". It is an\u00a0Interactive map of Complaints in the city. Every citizen after registering on the site DreamKyiv can leave a message on the map in respect of a municipal facility. All posts are moderated.\u00a0Each point on the map has: a brief description of the problem, object, a link to the profile of the deputy who is responsible for this problem, \u00a0commentary section, and the \"vote for the proposal.\" The purpose of voting - increase the chances of initiatives to be implemented. Each new message alerts by email the respective deputy. This layer serves as a map of electronic reception of Deputies. After solving the\u00a0problem moves into section \"What local Kyiv deputies are doing\".\n\n<strong>Development of park \"Partizan Glory\"</strong>\n\nPartisan Glory Park - is a green area in Kyiv, with an area of over 110 hectares, which is littered. Aim of the project would be to renovate and clean the park, expand foot and bicycles paths, install modern lighting, sports zones etc.\u00a0\n\nBasically \"DreamKyiv\" project aims on any project that can improve urban scenery, lifestyle of it's citizens etc. Everything is done voluntarily with support from locals, yet the project is creating partnership for the project to be successful and to go on. No financing is being done through grants. Only activists, locals and partnerships with other organizations, institutions etc.\u00a0\n\nWhat is your team and what are the ways of development the project?\u00a0\n\nInitially there were couple of organizers of the general idea to help reconstruct and develop the city. Now there are main leaders of each of the project that are collaborating with activists in each of them. \u00a0The work is done voluntarily yet for instance online edition is being financed as to the technical assistance and for some journalist work.\u00a0\n\nContacts: DreamKyiv online edition: https://www.facebook.com/dreamkyiv?fref=ts DremKyiv control group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/346902465463135/?fref=ts\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-25 08:40:06", "updated_at": "2018-06-05 15:36:43.642019", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 828, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 20.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 4, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2017-07-07 01:48:06.986183", "updated_at": "2017-07-07 01:48:06.986183", "deleted_at": "2017-07-09 18:51:44.458882", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16641, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 4384, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Notes from call with coordinator in Bonn</b>\n\nI talked to Elise Bouvet and she explained to me that to involve them we need to go through their own platform\u00a0https://www.onlinevolunteering.org/en/org/ and publish tasks as online volunteering opportunities.

The only thing that pops up is: are we sure the unMonastarians will have the time and space to actually dedicate themselves to these skill sharing workshops? Isn't there a risk of being absorbed by the preparations of the LOTE? I guess this is part of the unMon hosting the LOTE anyways :)\n\nConcerning the Human Rites (btw your English is really something!). Although you've got a point regarding the importance of the gesture and the action in bulding the signification, I was wondering if deciding already that the unMonastery is organized around a cycle of fiests isn't going to have the opposite effect. As an anthropologist, i know how much celebrative events create ties and bondage, but at the same time aren't they the result of necessity and time? For example, shouldn't celebrations emerge spontaneously in the flow? For example, the 1st year of the unMon? Also, there will be celebrative moments in the hosting communities: Matera and the 2d of July, for example, is something not to be underestimated :) I just feel that there is a risk of over-conceptualization (wow, that's a long word) and detachment from what the focus of the unMon really is. Celebrations also go with organization, or did I get you wrong?\u00a0\n\nOn the other hand I really think that the fact of opening up every two weeks is something necessary: it brings me back to what you so rightly said in Matera, during the first unMon, concerning the 4 levels of interaction. Knowing the southern culture, i really think that aggregative moments are going to be the way to break the initial ice.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-06-25 21:07:31", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:34.149137", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 334, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16904, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 4466, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Examples of articles</b>\n\nI also have some folks in mind in Bucharest which I'd love to invite to write a piece.\n\nAs example of insightful stories from Edgeryders I would offer (for inspiration):\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><a href=\"/t/the-urban-shepherd-of-stockholm/3581\">The Urban Shepherd of Stockholm</a>\u00a0(project based, what would be ideal :))</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"/en/the-edgeryders-guide-to-the-baltic/the-regeneration-of-meaning\">The regeneration of meaning</a> (more conceptual but also exhibiting examples of projects)</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"/t/the-urban-shepherd-of-stockholm/3581\">W</a><a href=\"/en/using-the-future/welcome-to-retirement\">elcome to retirement</a>\u00a0(easily digestible, maybe less focused on solutions but with high potential from the premise)</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nAlso, guidelines from last year's Spot the Future in Georgia, Armenia and Egypt are <a href=\"/t/guidelines-for-spot-the-future-articles-and-essays/2614\">here.</a>\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-26 14:55:00", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:44.760539", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 181, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10617, "user_id": 1818, "topic_id": 2528, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>toward a commitment of intent?</b>\n\nAlberto, I love the idea of expanding the narrative and creating opportunities to host hi-lo technologies.

Increasing mobility, fossilised formal education and overall addiction to the economic growth: just to list a few reasons why more soft networks and networking events are needed.\n\nSoft network enabling people to connect right skills and resources can be helpful.\n\nSoCap  DTF, that James mentioned, is a great initiative, I have enjoyed it there, but, I have to say, it is a bit costly to attend, unless you infiltrate as a volunteer.\n\nThe networking and partnership building for social innovation activities do exist, but \n\nnot yet covering the gaps sufficiently. Edgeryders community can conduct this kind of events in Europe with good results: not just the creativity boost and collective comforting, but real partnerships and projects put in work.\n\nIf anyone of edgeryders apart from me, finds that this idea is worth attention, I'll describe it in detail: program, possible participants, funding, media coverage etc, in separate  post, because I try to stick to the no scroll down rule here.", "created_at": "2012-06-24 21:19:23", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:34.842715", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 365, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17123, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 4126, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Create an event?</b>\n\nChris if you put up an event on the platform and just copy paste info into it, we can spread it around via social media.\n\nAlso if you want to be involved in the 1st call to start shaping the agenda together this week, add yourself here <a href=\"http://doodle.com/5wh9wfugmeqhit3c\">http://doodle.com/5wh9wfugmeqhit3c</a>.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-02-23 10:54:34", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:35.664878", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 67, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [14380], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17155, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 4596, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>interview style</b>\n\nbtw, re your first comment, @hegazy, I personally really dislike option 2: interview style.

Only later would it be translated into Italian.\u00a0\n\nThere are also language consequences.

This is guaranteed by price adjustment made by profit/utility maximing agents under flexible prices.\"\n\nSimilar here. Just that sale and purchase always happen at once for each participant, so to increase their sales (or purchases) they can tune <em>both</em> sales prices and puchase bids. In practical terms, price negotiations happens like this (in our prototype software at least):\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><em>Those who want something look through the offers on the platform and put them on wishlists.</em> Example: I might have a wishlist \"mobile phone\" and three same or similar phones on it that they would like to have for their respective prices, instructing the software to get them one of them in a barter deal. When an offer price of one of these increases, the item gets deactivated and I can decide again if to activate it again. If I get no or not enough barter deals in reasonable time, I can add more expensive alternatives to my wishlist (\"increase my bid\") and also tune my offers (lower prices, better products) to attract more people putting them on their wishlists. This increases the possible connections how my deal can be part of a network barter, which means it increases its probability.</li>\n\n<li><em>Those who offer something list it on the platform, choosing amount and price per unit.</em> If they get not enough trades for it, they can lower their offer prices, attracting more people who put this on their wishlists. They can also register more wants on their wishlists, or more expensive alternatives for what they already want.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nAlso compare the screenshot of our current software which I added to the post.\n\nSome implications of this (and I'm not 100% sure I got this right ...):\n\nI guess the last mechanism (tuning demand side to get more own offers bartered), applied to industrial producers, means this: To produce at capacity of their factories, they can't rely on customers buying their stuff on credit because there is no credit (so no way to create bursting housing, credit card debt etc. bubbles). Instead, they have to register own non-monetary demand,\u00a0generating business for their customers as well, to make their desired barter deals happen. Of course this does not mean direct barter, but can go via several intermediate steps. But it means that some highly efficient producer has to accept products from a less efficient supplier to generate enough business for himself. Which means that big and small businesses can coexist pretty well.\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>", "created_at": "2013-04-19 08:33:54", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:44.886844", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 478, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [15500], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17759, "user_id": 2569, "topic_id": 5955, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>A number of possibilities</b>\n\nI definitely think that the loose collaboration would be beneficial. As i mentioned in my responce to Alberto above, the need to have examples of positive actions that have been made by citizen-led organisations will be (i think) a cornerstone of the whole afternoon and a way of inspiring action in the participants.\n\nWith regards a more in depth collaboration, we are definitely limited in the physical resource that we can dedicate to the project. We have been gifted the space, which will have access to bars and restaurants and all the periferal things that may be needed for participants. Right now we don't have any finance to spend on bringing in speakers or participants. My next step us to reach out to potential collaborators (so we know we will have some people in the room with experience and direct interest) but ultimately we want it to be an open event for anyone. It is possible that we might be able to encourage one or more of these collaborators to offer small amounts of money to help bring in people from further afield. Right now i don't know til i ask them.\n\nWith regards manpower, well realistically it's just me and my computer, however, because we are running these series of events and shows within the festival (and they are fundraising for us on their main ticket page as well) we do have the network of the festival and all of it's associated PR and Media that we can latch onto. Provided that we can hit their deadlines for media (which i'm confident we can) we can use that as a strong source to bring in interested brains. I think we'll attract a lot of interested amatuers (like myself a year ago) which is why it is very important that we can tempt in some 'experts'.\n\nWith regards Aravella's question. I think it might be too specific for an event within an arts festival. I think it is a brilliant question, and i can think of a number of useful organisations and people from the Calais camps who would be perfect to bring 1st hand knowledge and experience to addressing a question like that. As a number of them will soon be turning their attention back towards supporting Greece perhaps this is something we could try to organise in Greece instead. My next big email is to the team at Help Refugees who i know are working on the ground in Thessaloniki.

The stories we\u2019ve shared and our interactions - social, peer-to-peer and rewarding learning experiences as they feel - are part of an overriding research goal: to enable us to better inform policy initiatives around youth transition. We\u2019d like to try to make sense of it all, as a community and with the help of a small research team; the team has been reading, analysing and placing Edgeryders material in contexts that the policy world, including institutions, can make sense of - i.e in the form of <strong>policy research papers</strong>, each addressing a specific theme.\n\nThrough this mission we aim to make sense of the material together! If we use the papers as a starting point for an open and collaborative writing process, as a community we can produce something much better than anything 10 experts in a room can put together. After the validation process is done, Rebecca will then synthesize the main points from the papers, and the community discussions around them into a first version of the transition handbook.\n\nThe transition handbook aims to leverage Edgeryders\u2019 wisdom to the point where it makes an impact in the policy community, by speaking to individuals in institutions charged with addressing specific issues. The document should also speak directly to young people and other Edgeryders, using key terminology as used by Edgeryders themselves.\n\n<strong><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IBrUGChnuhXamzCWF5OqndAgurog3D1x2pfhPxW2hF0/edit\">For a detailed overview of background, process and your role in building the handbook, as well as tentative structure and production timeline go to this doc. </a></strong>\n\n<h3> </h3>\n\n<h3><strong>Want to help make sense of Edgeryders experiences?</strong></h3>\n\nCompleting this mission basically means reviewing and reacting to the research papers, so mainly commenting on them as they are posted here as mission reports..\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Start by checking out the summary of Rebecca's and Valentina's ethnographic analysis:\n\n<a href=\"/t/edgeryders-transition-getting-the-big-picture/1686\"><strong>Edgeryders transition: Getting the big picture</strong></a>\n\nDo you recognise yourself in the description?

Traditionally the UK was pretty strong on the carbon fiber subject. Germany always was so-so but is slowly picking up speed I'd say (SGL Carbon). SGL seems to be somewhat non-BAU-future oriented as well, that is why I mentioned it to <a href=\"/u/chrono\">@chrono</a>. Japan was and is leader, now perhaps on a similar level as US. I should have some old patents flying around on the subject. Some of them can be pretty useful due to the detail required for various aspects (e.g. pyrolysis process) - but they are almost invariably a horrible read.\n\nCarbon fibers are pretty useful, especially in combination with carbon black (char) as an extremely versatile local electrical heating element + of course their mechanical properties. If you want very, very high lifetimes (wind turbine components) metals are usually problematic due to corrosion and problems with fatigue. Also composites scale very nicely from bike shed to very large factory. The resin system is another story, but perhaps it is possible to produce something close enough to amber without too much hassle or toxic waste.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-20 08:11:24", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:45.244205", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 313, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [18766], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21224, "user_id": 2524, "topic_id": 4815, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>my \"gender\" contribution</b>\n\nLucia Scopelliti, female, graduated with honors in Economics at Universit\u00e0 Cattolica del Sacro Cuore (Rome).

It would have the \"Register\" button on it and would come with the event description, so you wouldn't need to duplicate it. I think one can insert existing nodes directly with Panelizer, but haven't done so before.\n\nBut maybe you want more flexibility, so just the button itself? In that case, a simple solution would be a pane similar to the \"Landing page pane\" for the event list, but this time listing just one event (using an added contextual filter by node ID, passed in as parameter ... see \"Argument input\" in the view creation dialog). And creating a new display mode for the event content type that displays nothing ... that will display just the button, as this is added by Drupal Commons PHP code. This solution may seem hackish (and is so), but the benefit is, it gives us the number of attendants below the button and other benefits of the Drupal Commons in-code solution. That would not be possible easily with the alternative that I used in the \"signing up for tasks\" block discussed above.\n\nP.S.

I am unsure the view itself is worth anything.\n\nThe DOI shows you only a part of this whole space, but this time *with* tags. Why is it more interesting? A first reason, one guiding its design: it gives you a more readable view simply because it displays fewer items. But now, hey, since you only take a few of them, which ones should you show? THis is where the DOI trick enters the game, you compte some index, the DOI, that ranks items according to some focus of interest the user has, and make your pick.\n\nTake it the other way round and tell us why you would be interested in looking at the Global view, one mixing people, posts, comments and tags.\n\nWe had noted requests such as the ones enumerated in deliverbale D5.1:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Distinguish \u201crich\u201d posts or comments, those having a larger number of associated tags, and presumably being longer posts.</li>\n\n<li>The notion of a \u201cpopular\u201d tag (associated with more content) also came up as being of interest.</li>\n\n<li>The number of persons involved in a post is an interesting statistics.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nSo this is what that DOI trick should help us locate in the data and bring upfront through this DOI view.

It's the other way round, like we did back in Stockholm and like I always tend to repeat, it's us asking users \"what question you ask and what answer you expect to find\".\n\nAs @Jason_Vallet will confirm, this is where this DOI thing is going.

Since I am The Site Admin, I cannot rely on The Site Admin to protect me from trolling and abuse. If anyone had accused <em>you</em><em> </em>(or any ordinary user) of fraud, I would have invoked admin powers and banned the person into a smoking hole. But of course, if I do that to protect myself, it looks lame. So: I don't go ballistic, but I do speak my heart. I am careful to (1) only refer to episodes and not people (so, not \"X is a liar\" but \"Y has resorted to misrepresentation here\") (2) describes what happened, and only what happened and people can check for themselves (insult and misrepresentation, both documented) and (3) yes, I allow myself some feelings. These are my own, you can not share them but not really tell me how I should feel.\n\nThe more important one concerns the general tone of the Edgeryders online space. People should not be allowed to go berserk in it. I can't ban, because of the above; so I administer some verbal punishment. But if I fail to react, I am sending the message that it is OK to abuse people. And, I am afraid, so do you (again, not you as Sam, but you as some user): because a casual bystander will not know who is Sam, and who is Alberto, who is admin and who is not, and will just wonder \"what, the community manager is taking holidays or what?\". this poisons the well. You can help unpoison it by reacting immediately against violent speech; exactly because you have no horse in the race, I am surprised that was not the case.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-23 13:03:33", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:54.136269", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 341, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 2.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12272, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 6297, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Add me?</b>\n\nGreat.

Indirectly they also allow the development of a culture of mutual help, sharing and empowerment. This post is a description of what we have learned about care structures in communities during our years as community activists building Prinzessinengarten an urban garden in Berlin.\n\nBut let\u2019s start from the beginning\u2026.\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\">Prinzessinnengarten: Making gardens from wasteland</h2>\n\nhttps://player.vimeo.com/video/16450772\n\nAt Moritzplatz, a busy roundabout in the center of bustling Berlin-Kreuzberg, well over a thousand supporters have helped the site to grow, turning a lot that was vacant for 60 years into a flourishing garden. Without specific expertise, with little money and motivated by the idea of a communally used garden in the center of the city, we began in summer 2009 to put down the first roots of a flourishing garden between cement and rubble. By now, a huge diversity of plants is growing here as well as a diversity of social relations. People of different origins and of different ages meet and exchange their knowledge and their experience.\n\nThe Prinzessinnengarten is a communal project; our vegetable beds are shared without anyone claiming individual ownership. Over the course of four years, supporters from the local community have dirtied their hands in order to. This takes place in a neighborhood that is one of the most densely developed and socially most vulnerable in the city. Here a garden evolved that can sustain itself financially and that grew into a locus of social exchange and mutual learning.\n\nPrinzessinnengarten, as well as other urban gardens in Germany, have been able to develop small economies around its activities. Prinzessinnengarten has been able to support 15 full-time jobs during it seasons, being financially independent through its economic activities such as horticulture, the tending of a small caf\u00e9, selling its products, as well as giving training in gardening, ecology or the planning of further gardens. At the same time, it has been able to offer high quality, healthy and ecological food at affordable prices.\u00a0\n\nIn cooperation with local institutions, with universities and international partners, the Prinzessinnengarten became a laboratory for resilient forms of urban development. In a pragmatic manner, we have been asking questions on how to deal with urgent issues such as climate change, dwindling resources, food sovereignty and the loss of biodiversity. The answers being experienced and experimented on all strive toward the creation of a resilient city, not only taking global challenges such as climate change into consideration\u00a0but also incorporating local actors in the building of practical and local solutions. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe success of the garden has been vividly mirrored in vast press coverage: Since 2009, well over a thousand supporters have helped the site to grow \u201efrom an ugly vacant lot to a paradise\u201c (Die Zeit). 60,000 visitors come to Moritzplatz each year to see this \u201ebiotope and sociotope with a model character\u201c (Tagesspiegel), this \u201eutopia in miniature\u201c (Berliner Zeitung)\u00a0\n\nDespite the garden being a celebrated pioneer project and undisputed value even by official sources, in 2012 the Berlin Property Fund was commissioned to sell the plot of land on which the garden stands. We only had an annually renewable lease, leaving no prospects for long-term planning. Through the immense support of our public and an increasingly motivated government, the Berlin government decided to return the property the Borough of Kreuzberg-Friedrichshain. The Prinzessinnengarten has been able to establish its model character as a locus of social, ecological and urban change.\n\nTo discuss questions arising from this kind of community engagement, Elizabeth Calderon-L\u00fcning, Marco Clausen, and Asa Sonjasdotter initiated the Neighbourhood Academy in 2015:a self-organized open platform for urban and rural knowledge sharing, cultural practice and activism. This bottom-up academy combines different knowledge- and experienced-based formats: non-standardized knowledge, hands-on know-how, sensuous narratives and research methods. People, organizations, and projects from different neighborhoods come together. Participants can come from Berlin-Kreuzberg or the region around Berlin just as likely as from Detroit or rural areas in Greece to find common ground for learning and teaching.\u00a0\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\">So what have we learned about care structures in communities?</h2>\n\nIn taking over responsibilities in issues that affect the whole society - refugees, climate change, social and ecological justice, to name just a few - community-based and grassroots initiatives play an increasing role in tackling these challenges and their effects on the local level. They are breeding grounds for social innovations and new bottom-up-strategies. Often people take initiative when traditional or institutional forms of care and support decline or do not meet people\u2019s needs. Community gardens and urban agriculture- the field in which I am personally engaged- can serve as a good example. Without being part of planning, or political programs, these places are mostly created by local, self-organized initiatives. Based on local engagement and alternative forms of economy and often without public or financial support, community gardens contribute to the well-being, social inclusion, healthy and sustainable lifestyles, biodiversity, the physical- as well as the social climate. Not only they contribute to the physical health of their participants, but also to their sense of dignity and self-esteem.\n\nThere is also a downside to community engagement. While community organizations have to promote themselves with success stories to get recognition, political- and financial support, the negative aspects are often less visible. You hear a lot about precarious funding, internal or outside conflicts, political and economic pressure, multitasking, impossible workloads, competition between projects. At the same time, dealing with complex and often rigid political and social institutions, community activists have to become self-trained experts in finances, public relations, lobbying, community-organizing etc. But these fights are long and complex and the institutions and their procedures require a patience that easily outlive the time, the physical and mental resources individuals and grassroots initiatives are able to mobilize.\n\nOver time, this situation can result in what you might call an \u201eactivism-burnout\u201c. When this happens, physical, mental, and social damages are far too often just seen as a personal or biographical drama. These individual burn-outs are likely to be accompanied by a weakening or even a collapse of the organizations and initiatives that are often carried by the engagement of single individuals. The disintegration can lead to a situation where an organization loses knowledge, expertise, networks, and spirit.\n\nFor the reasons mentioned above, community care should also include structures to support the people that are directly invested in it. It should create securing and supporting networks. Instead of competing, it should allow people from different initiatives in different fields of engagement to share their knowledge of failure. There should be at once structures of collective learning and consultancy, which at the same time help the individuals to find spaces of trust and recreation. With the Neighborhood Academy, we started informal meetings with members of different groups and initiatives, not only to exchange experience and knowledge and to broaden networks and alliances, but also to deal with stress, conflict, fear, doubt, and failure on a more personal level. Even though this is just a tentative beginning, we experience a need for this kind of care and support structures, which was previously not expressed. Often issues related to the stressful conditions of organizations and community initiatives are externalized into the private and infuse personal relations . Therefore on a structural level, we see these caring structures also as a\u00a0form to win even when you lose.\n\nCommunity groups often focus on single questions, spaces, conflicts. They often react under economic and time pressure to immediate problems. They act within marginalized or weak political and economical communities. They deal with institutions and stakeholders with more time, much power, and resources whereas they rely on limited personal resources or precarious funding. Simultaneously there are a lot of joy, learning and personal empowerment involved as well as a sense of a meaningful life and community relations. However, the risk of failing is high, which can lead to frustration and disintegration.\n\nCommunity care structures can help to ease this stress not only in giving support but also in a form of what we call \u201ecollective learning\u201c. They can work as an archive for the knowledge, the experiences and know-how being created in grassroots and community initiatives. Thus, they allow activists to see themselves not only as part of a\u00a0singular local fight that you might win or lose\u00a0but as contributors to a collective living memory.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-06-13 21:01:09", "updated_at": "2018-05-21 16:40:28.869596", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1549, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 216.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 906, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 873, "post_number": 1, "raw": "It's 18:00 o'clock in Strasbourg and I'm rushing home to get ready.

Truth is, for some of us how Edgeryders would look like was just as surprising as a brand new toy to play with. A little too many minutes after 19:00, some would say, the website is finally up. You could see people entering the Welcome group and greeting each other, and then they have faces and then stories attached!\n\nFor me, personally, it was important to finally see who's ryding which edges.. until now we assumed there's plenty of Edgeryders out there, but providing them with a place where they can meet, share and ultimately be professional about transition by doing research on it. So the good news is: indeed, there's a feeling of community in there.. and this means there's huge potential to achieve what we want and communicate it to the world.\n\nLike any game, it takes some time to discover how it works, which button takes you where, what it takes to complete a mission and how many points you get for that etc. But that's the fabulous-ness of exploring. Of course, the purpose of beta testing being to collect information for improvement, you shouldn't be surprised if by chance you end up with -5 points : ) It's probably just a bug somewhere, but it's important to report it, as well as all sorts of problems you run into. I'm not sure about others, but navigating on the website was not as smooth as we would have wanted: but do keep in mind that it's a website in construction, a work-in-progress which needs all the input from the community to become what we want it to become. It's not an expensive product developed by a private entity and then laid out for us to use it. Working with open software is hard, so we're all stepping on unknown grounds. I'm sure you Edgeryders understand this and will bring your own thoughts to the table. We definitely aim at being truthful to observations, suggestions, and sincere comments expressed. Did you like it..???\n\nThank you Edgeryders for attending! We'll probably keep on testing until Thursday, after which date we'll announce the official launch! Reporting from live beta tests, Noemi\n\n<strong>UPDATE:</strong> On Thursday, October 20th beta testers spend the last hours navigating on Edgeryders until this first round of iterations is over. Giving that it's a lot to take in, the feedback reporting will be ongoing after this date. Stay with us for an open discussion of edgeryding at the beginning of next week..

You can test it (and use it for real trades!) by registering an account at <a href=\"http://www.makerfox.com/\">makerfox.com</a> (we renamed it). Let us know what you think!\n\nAnd now, the even bigger work of building a thriving community of practice around this maker marketplace starts. Yep, several thousand hours into this project, this can feel overwhelming. So we think it's time for us techies to open up the team for gifted community builders. To let others share the efforts and benefits of building the Makerfox marketplace. Oh, meet the Makerfox btw :-)\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b362dc97b52b5a657113795c0d7edabe7a1ceec5.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\"><br>\n</div>\n\nWe want to make it a welcoming and supportive community and exchange place for makers, hackers, craftsy people, entrepreneurs etc. \u2013 esp. benefiting those who are economically excluded (\"jobless\") or in crappy employment conditions. We can help ourselves, right? If only we had a better working tool to organize collaboration than money \u2013 with network barter, the technology behind Makerfox, we think we have a great candidate for such a tool now.\n\n<h3>Our offer: Half the revenue from \"your\" members, for 5 years</h3>\n\nTo make Makerfox a great economic self-help tool ASAP, we had an idea today. Since we have only a bit of money for this project so far we can't use money to pay all the community managers which the platform requires. We can use the Makerfox system itself however, which we invented to replace money. So we intend to share our future barter value revenues with our community builders, similar to how affiliate programs work. Here's the offer (admittedly still prototypical):\n\n<div style=\"padding: 10px; border: 4px solid \\#ffcc33;\">\n\n<strong>We look for</strong> one freelance community builder for Makerfox, for a 3 month renewable period. You can work as much or as little as you want, you can quit when you want, and you can work from where you want (it's all via Internet). Your compensation is half of all net commission fees of all members who join makerfox.com because of you, for 5 years for each member. The compensation is in barter value, and minus 5 USD in barter per member (for tech reasons, see below).</div>\n\nYou should have a hand for providing visibility to online content (makerfox.com in this case) and in helping \"your\" new users to start using the marketplace. Ideally, you are a maker yourself or interested in maker / DIY / entrepreneurial culture. You should be able to write well in English (not necessarily natively of course!), and maybe in one more major European language (German / Spanish / French / Italian / Russian).\n\nOk then :) If you're interested to give this a try, just leave a comment below and we can schedule a video call with the Makerfox team and we can take it from there. And if you like community building but not our offer, you can tell us how we can improve. Feel free to share community building ideas as well \u2013 this is not a competitive call. It is for one person during this test phase, but if it all works out, many more can join and contribute as well (if they harmonize with the existing team \u2013 you will understand).\n\n<h3>\"Fine print\"</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>We pay in barter value, not money.</strong> To not create misunderstandings: We do not pay you in money, but in any products and services of your choice that are offered on the Makerfox marketplace. That's because the Makerfox platform earns its own commission fee revenues also (for now exclusively) in barter value and not in money. This might be the strangest job offer you've read so far, and that's just the <em>start</em> of the economy to come :P</li>\n\n<li><strong>You choose when to get paid, but wait for the system to meet your request.</strong> You can wait as long as you like before ordering them using your account on the marketplace \u2013 it will be automatically settled by pre-registered \"barter value payments\" that we make to your account according to the commission shares you earned. It means that you can wait until the marketplace fills up and has something that interests you. However since your payments are made in barter value, they are subject to the same mechanics as all other network barter exchanges on Makerfox: it can take some time until the algorithm finds a trade that includes a payment to you, and as usual on Makerfox you can help the algorithm along by using order alternatives, offering items yourself etc..</li>\n\n<li><strong>This does not fit for everyone.</strong> Getting paid in barter value is admittedly experimental, and the revenue sharing model of course has its risks. So to be fair, we advise against taking up this offer if you have to rely on this income in any way. But for example if you are out of work at the moment, somehow get by and think this entrepreneurial endeavour is fun (or even share our vision for the maker economy): welcome very much!!</li>\n\n<li><strong>Estimate your earnings!</strong> Of course \"entrepreneurial\" means that, with this compensation scheme, you share a part of our risk, but also great prospects. You can estimate the numbers yourself. Some hints: for Edgeryders for example, starting from scratch, the effort for finding new community members was about 73 new members per person month of work; in terms of turnover, every eBay member who was economically <em>active</em> there in the past 12 months generated an average trade volume of 138 USD/month (source: <a href=\"http://www.ebayinc.com/system/download_links/eBayInc_FactSheet_Q4_FullYear_2013.pdf\">data from 2013</a>, p.3); and the commission fee of Makerfox is 7% incl. VAT (5.88% without).</li>\n\n<li><strong>Why 50% \"minus 5 USD\"?</strong> For technical reasons the Makerfox platform does not receive the first 10 USD of each user's commission fees, so we share that fact with you by deducting 5 USD of barter value per user. Of course your compensation for a user is never negative.</li>\n\n<li><strong>All new members will be considered \"yours\" for now.</strong> Since you will be our first and only community builder initially, we will simply assume that all new members joining in this 3 month period are your recruitees, so you'll get your share for them. If this idea works out, we'll later implement affiliate tracking links so that each community builder knows who joined because of them.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Taxation and documentation.</strong> In most jurisdictions, working as a Makerfox community builder is considered taxable income even though you don't get paid in money. It is treated like other forms of bartering: it's legal, but both sides of the trade have to be documented with invoices or other receipts, denominated in money units. We do this by writing invoices for our own barter value income (commission fees from users), and you have to do this by writing us an informal receipt (or an invoice if you have a company) when you get a payment. This is the safest approach, tax-wise. Of course, the big downside is that you might have to pay taxes in money for income in barter value. Until government starts to accept taxes in barter value, this means we have to use a set of legal hacks to avoid this situation as much as possible. And indeed, there are some options. One is that if you have a business yourself, you would only do business expenses with your Makerfox account, effectively spending all your barter value income in tax-deductible ways. Another is to stay below your country's income tax limit (might fit for people who are out of work at the moment; you can easily regulate the amount of barter value income by ordering only as much with your Makerfox account). Yet another is that if you're based in Greece, barter value income is tax free. We have collected 20 or so more tips and will gladly evaluate in detail together what are the best options in your case. However be prepared that the worst case could be, indeed, to pay some taxes in money for income in barter value.</li>\n\n</ul>", "created_at": "2014-04-06 23:16:09", "updated_at": "2019-05-24 14:34:03.494754", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1437, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 125.4, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 147, 3791], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21631, "user_id": 3331, "topic_id": 687, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Background</b>\n\n@Noemi, you have a good one in \"what it would be like for patients to work side by side with researchers\".

One such event would be a severe influenza pandemic: one that killed 1% of the population and scared the rest, hitting the whole world simultaneously so that there would be no help from outside because there would be no outside.\n\nIt's encouraging to see how young people, in this case previously organised around a political party though I guess any other sufficiently strong organisation would do, can <strong>look at a crisis, decide what to do, and do it</strong>.\n\nI'm very interested in the strong uncompromising emphasis placed on using <strong>assessed needs</strong> as a guide for rapid action, and in the <strong>resistance</strong> met in several fronts because other actors insist on looking at other ways to prioritise action, and how you had to talk with people, some times for hours, to overcome that resistance.\n\nFor our pandemic work, we found that in a complex situation, with many hands and conflicting agendas, orientation can be a challenge. It was mostly table-simulation work, but the idea was, Would it be helpful to share a <strong>language</strong> designed to rapidly map the situation, based on <strong>needs</strong> and <strong>levels of provision</strong>, so that everyone would see where and how to help from day one?\n\n<a href=\"http://www.ResilienceMaps.org\">http://www.ResilienceMaps.org</a> and <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/FluSCIM\">https://archive.org/details/FluSCIM</a> propose just that. In case it may feel as useless noise for people working on the ground, here's a summary:\n\n1) Needs are of <strong>people</strong> (not dying from too cold, too hot, thirst, hunger, disease or injury), of <strong>groups</strong> such as yours and families (workplace, communication, transport, control of useful resources), and of <strong>organisations</strong> (mapping the situation as it changes, adapting plans, having people move in and out of the organisation via deaths, recruitment and the like).\n\n2) <strong>Levels of provision</strong> go from the individual (manage temperature with clothes) to the global (sat phones). If any one level fails, needs still exist because that's what defines a need: that it can't be wished away. So we must look at <strong>substitutions</strong>: sat phones if land lines are cut, or mirrors to send messages with light if nothing else works.\n\n3) Such a language can quickly be used and then shared (simply a <strong>spreadsheet of needs x levels</strong>) to <strong>map holes in resilience for people</strong>. For example, if the people in a certain area have their vital needs sorted out, but have water only for 5 days, their 20 diabetics have insulin for one week and for communications the antennaes do work but they have no local chargers - then those are the 3 vital problems that have to be prioritised and solved: water from that other place (or move people if water is heavier than they are), insulin if we're lucky, and drop them a few chargers and solar panels.\n\nCould this \"mapping needs and levels of provision\" language assist in <strong>reducing the resistance you've found and may find in the future</strong>? Maybe a subset of this, or an adaptation?

Crowdfunding works, and there are several implementations in Europe. Maybe what's needed is to make them more mainstream, to the point of being tax-deductible money entities? Nothing radical, but rather change what's already there so that it works better for what's needed.\n\nSecond, maybe there could be some incentive structure. Something small but segmented: finalist donations with a ceiling of 1% per individual or a 2% per business (just making the figures up), that would have big deductions (big deductions are the why for the ceiling).\n\nThird, there's a market for losers. Ideas that are not funded should be recycled, networked, improved. In other words, reward failure. How's that done? Wherever there's a project repository, the rules might be that if you don't get funded there's a way out in which you and your idea become part of a larger pool of replaceable parts. A fermenting or composting pot.\n\nAn even stupider idea: let the poor pay. Let me explain. There's this \"out of poverty\" book by Paul Polak, a psychiatrist turned development-entrepreuner, who says products must be designed with a price tag first, and that there's a huge market in the \"two dollars a day\" part of the economic pyramid. (The bottom part of the real 99%.) He suggests ways around the problem such as thinking in terms of reducing the scale a lot. So, if you can't buy a horse, maybe you can buy a pony, or a dog, to help you carry the load - or maybe you could buy a hundred ants. So maybe there could be a way to aggregate the microfunds of those in need (yes, them - or us), to start things that serve their (our) own needs. Kind of a subscription, maybe. Bottom of the pyramid crowd-funding, by those who understand the problems? Because maybe we can't beat a dead horse, trying to get the big guys to start emptying their pockets even though they clearly \"should\". This has been done by Marcin Jakubowski for his http://blog.opensourceecology.org project, with the True Fans way to finance his stuff. So maybe there's a role for people who help you find your market and then help them fund you?\n\nThe elements of the situation are at least three: people with projects, people with funds, and the rules of the game. People with projects can be taught to write business plans, but I'm not sure that's the main issue (except where it is). I've heard in Spain it's harder and more expensive to start a business than in other countries in Europe. So maybe that falls under the \"rules of the game\" area: simplify the rules - write the current rules in a wiki and \"fork\" the darn body of regulations (=create an alternative body of rules), suggesting alternatives that are much more agile while still sticking to the stated aims of the regulating body.\n\nIt's a huge area, and new ideas seem to be needed. The old ways don't seem to work. Let's all bring more logs to the fire, as this won't be solved with a post or two. This looks like a hard problem. Incentives, and the incentives to put good incentives in place, are always hard.\n\n", "created_at": "2011-12-26 15:47:03", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:23.803864", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 600, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23173, "user_id": 3363, "topic_id": 5815, "post_number": 8, "raw": "To clarify my view, in case it's necessary, I'm declining because I don't see how spending my time on publishing a paper gets me closer to implementing <a href=\"/t/buoy-coordinated-crisis-response-and-community-based-mutual-aid-without-a-state/684\">Buoy</a> in communities where it is desired and would be helpful.

Sorry for the late reply, your posts went under my radar. Interestingly though, the outlines of a similar approach have been forming for us since my post.\n\nBasic backstory: we are professionalising our services as a collective of freelancers. For recurring\u00a0services we have simple formats (graphic design, workshops, ...) that are easily sold and applicable to many kinds of clients. Each team member has their own specific expertise, so the division there is easily made. Eg. the workshop guy would sell workshops, but meanwhile also be on the lookout for graphic design missions. One mission could involve both writing and graphics. Collaboration is easily coordinated there. The organisation stays agile, without dependencies, with a shared story. These are the easy advantages teaming up as freelancers offers.\n\nProjects, paid or not, are to be initiated and implemented by the champion (team member or volunteer) that proposes it, much like what you describe. Some more coordination is required and this is usually done by the champion. I'm sure the overdeliver idea is applicable to us in this early stage.\u00a0Not so sure about\u00a0the extra payment for carrying a project, as it varies a lot from industry to industry how much money is available for covering these costs. The client could\u00a0have low funds (underfunded education system), there's plenty of competition (projects involving more generic services eg. web and graphic design) etc.\n\nFlagship projects do create openings for higher margin formats, if we can find a way to channel it there. A hard thing to quantify and it would increase dependencies again, projects being the indirect sales strategy for other formats. Many things to be aware of, curious to see what will work best.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-03-13 19:58:35", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:09.333936", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 303, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [23272], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23357, "user_id": 81, "topic_id": 2254, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Spoke to Nathan!</b>\n\nI just spoke to Nathan: was supposed to be a short talk but it ended up being quite a long conversation on the link between Matera and the unMonastery.

I've intended to make use of systems like time banks and a Local Exchange and Trading System, but they aren't very prevalent or widely used so it just isn't top of mind.\u00a0\n\nI am interested very broadly in this topic of caring for the commons. I'm interested in the work of Michel Bauwens in his Peer to Peer foundation\u00a0<a href=\"http://p2pfoundation.net/P2P_Theory\">http://p2pfoundation.net/P2P_Theory</a>\u00a0and also\u00a0the thinking of Polly Higgins in embracing other species into the idea of the commons. The main reason why the Commons interests me is my background and profession in working with museums, heritage and national libraries.\u00a0\n\nFor me the Commons isn\u2019t just an ancient notion but a current and highly relevant notion. Fundamentally, the commons are goods that are all shared (universally) and are all gifts (so, impossible to measure economically, or commodified, but important to value). \u00a0The idea of the commons sits well with taking a long view: they exist to be preserved and passed down the generations. Just right for the museum sector. The beneficiaries or owners of the commons are not just humans but all species. The commons is a principle that should be applied to both our biosphere and our digitally-powered knowledge sphere, and both need preserving as heritage and nurturing as new growth. Our knowledge sphere should be applied to preserving the biosphere as commons. Museums must start seeing their digital strategy as much more than marketing through a web presence but exposing their collections to the hive mind for this purpose. It\u2019s much more than just a technical or legal challenge of digitisation.

This really underlines for me the extent to which the biggest obstacles to 'commons thinking' are cultural.

My family moved out in the suburbs 4 years ago during a real estate boom, my mom really wanted a house since all her life had lived in an appartment: a box of matches like they called them in communist times. So we bought half of a <strong>duplex</strong> (you know that sort-of-double house, but it's actually 2 houses in 1 since the entrance, utilities, gardens are separated). The neighborhood was new and a lot of new duplexes were build, very close to one another, actually forcing the community to cooperate to improve their living - like agreeing on a main gate at the entrance in the neighborhood and chipping in to do that. What they did first, they each modified the initial design of the neighborhood in which all houses looked the same to make theirs unique. they repainted them, and most interestingly, they all built higher and thicker fences than the initial ones to make sure they have some privacy.\n\nAfter 4 years, everybody knows everybody, it's a very small territory for so many houses+families and of course there are conflicts as well. But there is no intimacy; when somebody has a barbeque it's like you're having it, because the smoke and smell, and noise! it's everywhere. and the peaking, and the gossips.. So I couldn't wait to move away..\u00a0\n\nOf course, co-housing is different and I think I understand how; do you think it's very important for the people to have similar interests, background and education? otherwise I don't see it working..\n\nor maybe it's a societal thing? I don't see my fellow Romanians being up for something like this.. as a society we're lacking trust, we're still very suspicious about things we have to put our money into.. maybe the young and educated would do so, but not the others.\u00a0\n\n--\n\nLastly, I was wondering if there's a resource space online where we could read more about your project in particular, since you say it's an official co-housing project. It doesn't seem like a business model, but it was born out of your initiative, right? \u00a0So are there any private gains as well, in addition to the savings each family does when taking part in this?\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-02-06 11:40:26", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:13.505936", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 440, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 1.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3265, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 3232, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/2/221c9385d2704ad66e8c24343221fdf972f2e7ac.JPG\" width=\"690\" height=\"461\"><br>\n\nHi everyone, \u00a0hope you had a good trip back and have managed to rest a bit!\u00a0\n\nInga is writing a draft report which summarises the \\#futurespotters conversations we have been having.

What I think is that emergencies make a changement in approach happening: I would say that on side people involved \u00a0become more \"possessive\" because they are afraid for their close community (friends, family....) but on the other hand they try to support how they can (if it has not high costs).\n\nThis is the cas for wifi: once you pay for internet it doesn't matter how many pc are connected (except maybe for the speed of your connection...but we are talking here of hundreds of pc).\n\nCicero (yes the Roman Cicero) used to write that there are things in commons (communia) which are not to be denied to other people becase these things are offered by Nature and they are iis qui recipiunt utilia, danti non molesta (useful for the ones who receive them and not a problem for the ones who give them). And, more over, sharing these goods doesn't affect one's possibility to keep being generous towards his familiy or community.\n\nAltough Internet is not offered by nature I think that mutatis mutandis the example is pretty close.\n\nUnfortunately I am not convinced that what has happened with wifi would necessary happend for other goods.\n\nOne could ask. but if people open their wifi during the emergency why they cannot do it in normal life. I am afraid that the reason is, as always, in a lack of trust in the others (I think I wrote about it somewher) which, in some cases even makes sense. An example? An internet connection might be shared among three \u00a0or for appartments but it implies that all the users agree on \"how\" to use it, so for ex. they have to agree a policy about \"illegal\" downloading, and except in case of cohousing your neighbour might have a competely different idea! Of course none thinks such a thing during an earthquake....\n\nSharing a wifi connection has much more implications than sharing a washing machine (it happens in France) even if it is definitely easier.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-31 08:15:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:15.841182", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 430, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24573, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 6059, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Suggestion</b>\n\n@Federico_Monaco this is your idea, so you have last word.

I haven't finished one single course, but had a lot of fun and made my attention span even shorter. I enjoy the fact that for a couple of month (duration of the course)\u00a0I have an access to carefully selected good quality content, it gives me a break from locates and pictures of latte with marshmallows on top from my FB friends unpdates. Talk to people on the forum designated to the course, and actually get updates on my country of origin, as I usually join the local forum.\u00a0Certainly, I learn something.\u00a0\n\nThe hate part of my love&amp;hate relationship lies in the fact that this kind of education is still not seen as the investment. I'm under impression that if you drag yourself through some obsolete university program it is still viewed as more of an investment than a bunch of completed brilliant courses on coursera and alike.\u00a0\n\nI guess it is going to change. May be when we will have more coursera-graduates as employers.\n\nAlso made me think of a younger acquaintance - school drop out. She dropped out because she doesn't see the point. She got a job: hard and unqualified, but reasonably well payed. So at the moment she\u00a0can have relatively interesting life. But, she can't go to the uni before she's done with school, and there's still some prjudice around, even amongst students themselves. Screw uni, the actual courses you can read in a book from the library. But the phisycal real-life networks which come with the university studies are not accessible.\u00a0\n\nAlso, regardless of whether your uni degree gets you a job, I find it, currently an identity question. It is easier to be \"the student who ocassionally does shit jobs\" than simply \"cleaner\". Or even a \"barman\". These ocassional jobs were not regarded as shitjobs a while ago. Now, even though these jobs are much\u00a0difficult to get,\u00a0I can feel that there is some change in the discourse. Now, when you become a cleaner or a barman it is sometimes perceived as some sort of destiny...\u00a0I suppose it comes from the current economic situation and less room to make class jumps.\u00a0\n\nSo, yeah, at some point a coursera-graduate might be regarded as an identity equal to that of the conventional student. It might be already happenning...\n\n", "created_at": "2013-10-06 11:11:33", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:16.840159", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 531, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31390, "user_id": 1450, "topic_id": 4052, "post_number": 24, "raw": "yep, sounds good to me, and I'm happy to work on the sidebar.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-01-29 09:46:08", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:52.663761", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 16, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [31249], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13597, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2144, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>WOMEX</b>\n\nWomex 2013 blue sticker.

Updating website, writing blogs, applying for grants, report writing, public speaking are what I have been doing these days as a Project Associate of DairyMaker Code +Design Challenge 2015 organized by RAN which is jointly funded by World bank and Microsoft.\n\nAfter the magnanimous disaster, I was sadden by the death and injuries to Nepalese citizens and determined to show my enrollment in the rescue operation and initiated the Solar Powered Light and Mobile Charger \u00a0project through RAN. I think with this project I will be directly in touch with victims as well as National and international rescue initiatives. I am highly motivated to show my presence in this disastrous situation as a Local Engagement Manager. Let\u2019s work together for supporting initiatives.

The descent of dozens of ERers to initiate the unMo space has practical and symbolic power.\u00a0 We could easily do a mop &amp; bucket brigade and remove 95% of the cave dust in an afternoon.\u00a0 A light show and some flag unfurling might just render us visible (amid the other flags and light shows) to the Materani that something is finally about to happen.\u00a0 Addressing the plumbing, cooking and sleeping logistics would require that we address plumbing/cooking/sleeping logistics; more sustainable solutions might not be that much harder to solve than temporary ones (especially when they need to be done anyway.)\u00a0 This may effect economy of scale - 45 workers might be more flexible than 145.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>The suggested primary goal of LOTE#3 is to create a catalogue of the combined skills/excellence of the ER community.\u00a0 I suggest that by building the unMo as an organ for ER research we get something beyond a catalog of current skills, we get a laboratory for refining new ones.\u00a0 A motto might be experience first, then reflexion.\u00a0 The very minimum, before we risk diluting our already taxed resources, is to create a project management spread sheet that slots in all activities and actors to ensure that everything is building in a coherent effort.</span>\n\n<span>At this point the unMo is lagging behind.</span>\n\n<span>Bembo,</span>\n\n<span>Bergen</span>\n\n", "created_at": "2013-07-08 10:49:35", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:48.785664", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 864, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5539, "user_id": 26, "topic_id": 5506, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<h2 class=\"content-section\">BRIEF \\#1</h2>\n\nHU = Hacking Utopia Project UDK\n\nOC = OpenCare Research Project\n\nTask#1:\u00a0<strong>sign up for project </strong>(missing information)\n\nDeliverable\u00a0<strong>HU</strong>\n\nTime: <strong>2\u00a0minutes</strong>\n\nDeadline:\u00a0<strong>Sunday, 10.4.</strong>\n\n<s>Instructions</s>:<em>\u00a0Community manager's not: URL removed for privacy</em>\n\n- - - -\n\nTask#2:\u00a0<strong>Personal Profile\u00a0</strong>\u00a0\u00a0\n\nDeliverable\u00a0<strong>OC</strong>\n\nTime:\u00a0<strong>1/2 hour</strong>\n\nDeadline:\u00a0<strong>Sunday, 10.4.</strong>\n\nInstructions:\n\nMake it easier for us to connect you with one another based on complimentary interests and skills by completing your personal profile on\u00a0edgeryders.eu:\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Login to the platform\u00a0https://edgeryders.eu/en/user/login\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Go to your profile page:\u00a0bit.ly/1MilNyk\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Upload your picture\u00a0(the portraits that Bjorn took are all available to\u00a0download here)\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Update your bio with the following information\u00a0(from the collaboration mosaic exercise we did on the last day of the workshop: http://bit.ly/23kttrx)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0a.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Your practical skillset (pick from list / add what's missing)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0b.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0What you are interested in learning during this course\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0c.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0What you are interested in offering/contributing\n\n- - - -\n\nTask#3:\u00a0<strong>Upload content from workshop</strong>\n\nDeliverable\u00a0<strong>OC\u00a0/ HU</strong>\n\nTime:\u00a0<strong>1 hour</strong>\n\nDeadline:\u00a0<strong>Tuesday, 12.4.</strong>\n\nInstructions:\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Pull out your documentation from the listening triads on care (exercise from day 1 when you were split into groups of three)\n\n\u00a02.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Open a word processing document and write down your reflections around one or more of the following themes in the context of care\u00a0(if you didn't talk about care or one of the questions we had on the wall, repeat the conversation on skype or talk to yourself):\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a01.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0People on the move.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a02.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Boosting one another\u2019s mental and spiritual resilience\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a03.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Hacking and Making\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a04.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Open Science and Technologies\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a05.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Communities &amp;

What is trust in Edgeryders and how does it work?</h2>\n\nEdgeryders is an experiment in decentralised organisation structures. We are learning how to think and work as a network in a spirit of mutual support and camraderie. By learning to harness our collective intelligence towards solving problems, we are investing in our own capacity to build the world in which we live together.\n\nThis requires us all to learn new kinds of collaboration skills both as individuals and as a collective. What successes we have had so far rest on two legs: openness and trust. By opening our processes, knowledge, time and resources with one another we are engaging in a massive exercise in trust. By assuming good faith, that our peers wish us well, in all our interactions with one another, we allow one another to fail well and learn from our mistakes together.\n\nWhat makes all of this possible is the social contract underpinning our interactions and collaborations with one another. Please make sure you understand it [url coming here], and help newcomers to the community to do the same. Some key principles...\n\n**Accuracy:** ensure that whatever information you spread is factually correct and supported by credible data. If you cannot be certain of the accuracy of a statement or claim, e.g. because it is based on hearsay, i.e. something you <em>think</em> someone said or did, refrain from spreading it. To do otherwise is to sow the seeds of distrust and disrespect.\n\n**Confidentiality:** the importance of respecting people's privacy and not reveal personally-identifiable information about them. This includes information about people's social, economic or psychological situation. Remember, we live in a surveillance paradigm and are responsible for safeguarding one another's privacy.\n\n**Generosity:** Assume good faith in all communication with your peers. Where you have doubts, ask a question the way you would to a trusted and liked peer. You would be surprised how many avoidable conflicts arise because people feel unjustly accused due to how questions are framed.\n\n**Intellectual integrity:** When possible speak for yourself based on your own first hand experience, and present verifiable cases or examples. Watch out for [logical fallacies](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/), and gently point them out when you do spot them. This helps everyone discover blind spots in our knowledge or thinking, and makes us all smarter together.\n\n**Personal responsibility:** When you see something you think can or should be improved, take responsibility for proposing a solution that you are willing put time and effort into building. This is important because what allows us to stay independent and not have to compromise for money, is if everyone is helping to maintain the infrastructure we all use. \n\n**Shared ownership:** Projects born and developed collectively on the community platform are owned by every single person who has contributed to their evolution. Forking projects by taking them out of the platform or building new organisations around them is fine if you use names and visuals different from those of the original projects. This is to make it clear that whenever people interact with the new projects or organisations, they are engaging with a group of individuals and not the community as a whole or the not-for-profit social enterprise with the same name that supports it. \n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2.

Making it easier for one another to support each others great projects</h2>\n\nInformation overload is a key reason why people choose not to engage in projects- if a call for participation requires us to spend too much time and energy on analysing what needs to be done, and how we can help...we are less likely to engage in it.\n\nFor those driving the projects that need help, it is easy to be blind to the needs of \"newcomers\" or possible customers/funders because we are so immersed in the work and know it very well. But we are often new to one another's projects... so we can help structure the information for each other.\n\n* Join the content management team _[URL coming soon]_.\n* Join the project development and management team _[URL coming soon]_.\n* Join the fundraising team _[URL coming soon]_.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--4\">4.

Understanding group dynamics and how you function in them</h2>\n\nA lot has been written about group dynamics, but many of us are not really aware of how we function in different roles and situations in groups. Especially not in online-offline communities. If you have some suggestions for helpful reading, please add them in comments below. A good way to develop your competences is through learning by doing and sharing your reflections with others.\n\n* Join the community management team _[URL coming soon]_.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--6\">6. What do I do when things go wrong or when conflicts arise?</h2>\n\n**Ask for a personal call with one of the community managers.** Explain the situation, and ask for their help in trying to make sense of how to move forward. If you are sad or hurt, tell them. Remember, no one can read your thoughts unless you make them known, and it's very difficult for others to help unless you ask for it. \n\n**Accuracy:** ensure that whatever information you spread is factually correct and supported by credible data. If you cannot be certain of the accuracy of a statement or claim, e.g. because it is based on hearsay, i.e. something you <em>think</em> someone said or did, refrain from spreading it. To do otherwise is to sow the seeds of distrust and disrespect.\n\n**Critical thinking:** Listen actively to the concerns of those involved in the conflict, but keep in mind the need to maintain critical distance if you are to really help resolve the situation. Watch out for [logical fallacies](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/), and point them out when you do spot them.

Yes they are certainly a big part of the problem behind a corrupted state, but perhaps we could invent new fitter corporate forms that better leverage the network, openly colloborate and have redifined goals and visions. \u00a0I think in many ways these idealistic corporations could outcompete the big hierchal dinosaurs through radically reduced fixed overhead, and the ability to outmaneuver and adapt and more importantly the ability to actually have people rally behind their cause. \u00a0I know such organizations would probably not provide welfare directly, but through increased job creation, flater distribution of profits, and a reskilling of the population with production and presumably resilient related skills, they would indirectly provide more people with the means to provide welfare. \u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-23 16:11:14", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:39.659550", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 416, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [9690], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29559, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 4353, "post_number": 14, "raw": "<b>Engagement and outreach for projects</b>\n\nSo I think it is a combination of\n\n1. <strong>Having a clear social contract and engagement model for would be contributors to your project</strong> (I think this crowdfunding campaign planner is a good way of approaching this)\n\n<iframe class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"600\" id=\"doc_90040\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.scribd.com/embeds/136876099/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=slideshow&amp;access_key=key-2ipubcthiugqcdkpkp94&amp;show_recommendations=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n\n\u00a0\n\n2. <strong>Make it easier for community managers to help get the word out by updating the <a href=\"/t/edgeryders-news-calendar-april-to-december-2015/4277\">Edgeryders News Calendar wiki</a></strong> with your call to action + Project url.\n\n3. <strong>Make it easier for community members to support one another's projects by helping to fix UX issues on the project landing pages</strong> - here is my analysis of <a href=\"/t/want-to-make-it-easier-for-others-to-support-great-projects-help-improve-the-landing-pages-ahead-of-this-weeks-newsletter/4181\">areas for improvement</a>.\n\nCome to think of it, the above should probably go into some kind of \"Building projects on Edgeryders\" guide.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-11 07:55:38", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:42.723088", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 203, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [29114], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29644, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 4348, "post_number": 12, "raw": "<b>Thanks to the Internets</b>\n\nHello Keshav and others, and welcome!

I value the focus on what is actually found to work in practice for real people. And it's often hard to isolate what, in general, are enabling factors, and what is just accident, that makes little difference. Then there's the added complication that people sometimes differ greatly in how they work. We can see this in education as well as work. What works to motivate one person might turn another one off.\n\nI'll rephrase what I was trying to say earlier, in the hope it might help. I do think that we can consider a few different kinds of enabling factors for \\#opencare.\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>The skills, attitudes, competences, knowledge, experience, etc. of individuals involved.</li>\n\n<li>The designed environment, in the sense of the Peckham Experiment etc., but also including public spaces, communal spaces, sizes and geometry of living spaces (indoors and outdoors) and how their relative location</li>\n\n<li>The culture of care -- related to what Denis Postle calls the \"psycommons\"</li>\n\n<li>The designed opportunities for interaction, engagement, collaboration -- like your populated 'spaces round a kitchen table'.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n\"Policy\" -- what a hard word indeed. I think we would all agree that a policy statement can be no more than an empty promise; and that misguided policy can be worse than no policy. I can well believe that the policies for regeneration or addiction you refer to could have been misguided.\n\nBut I wouldn't want to dismiss the efforts of policymakers altogether. Maybe policy can act as a reminder to concrete effective actions? A point for coordination? Or are you trying to say that there is something inherently wrong with policymaking at present? Maybe it's too much (a) embroiled in politics and (b) too \"top-down\". Maybe we could have a policy that states that all policies are to be developed from the bottom up? Or that certain areas should be kept deliberately free of policy?\n\nIf you really think that policymaking is essentially flawed, then maybe you're thinking that our current mechanisms of government are fundamentally flawed, and I wouldn't disagree. Similar flaws appear at national and European levels. What we do about that is another matter.

I think the high level description is would start with \"the bush drum and morse code\" and very quickly gets extremely complicated and full of acronyms. You can transmit and store info in many, many different ways of course. A few core concepts are a/synchronous, bandwidth, latency, proxy servers/relay stations, and of course the protocol, and architecture (or topology). The last term is often important in our context as we generally like 2p2 (peer to peer, everyone on eye level). Funny enough the military side prefers a similar architecture (because it is robust/resilient) but they often call this net-centric - and don't like to share as much. Because this would make things much too simple, the market decided to bring in intellectual property (patent) considerations - and made it crazy beyond belief in one swift stroke.\n\nAs transmission and storage technologies became much more powerful recently, we can basically start our own small telcos and have started to do that. As we can't or don't want to take the \"commercial (patented) solution\" we've started to make you own protocols (standards) for the applications (using the hardware) we care about. However, as these are not all the same or compatible - things get a <em>little </em>bit complicated.

The example of where the market does do this is where organisations invest in graduate programmes where they spend time in different parts of the organisation to become \u201chybrids\u201d and get training (in the best cases) in the learning culture you describe. The graduate programme provides these credentials. But while the people selected to these programmes may have a variety of different skills, when it comes to the learning skills you describe, the organisation will select people who can make the organisation successful, so by default they\u2019re unlikely to recruit anyone who may question how things are done, let alone be able to self-organise others to create alternatives!\n\nWhat I found fascinating through the Edgeryders report is the \u201cself-selecting method\u201d as a way to attract people with an intrinsic motivation towards the project.

Especially if it's well tagged as you point out with the tweets.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Meet the Edgeryder: </strong>Last year we did a <a href=\"/search/content/Meet%20the%20Edgeryder\">series</a> in which we would introduce the world to a member of the community and what they do/ are currently very interested in. The post were written p2p, i.e. I pick a community member and write something about them and they pick another member and write about them. Like a carousel. The advantage being that it's a nice way also for community members to discover and get to know one another and it makes us feel seen and appreciated when someone shines a light on us.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li><strong>(Making a)\u00a0living on the Edge:</strong>\u00a0This is a series that has somehow changed shape. In ER 1 we had the mission called <a href=\"/t/the-quest-for-paid-work/371\">the quest for paid work</a> for\u00a0which\u00a0Chris Pinchen did filmed interviews and blogposts about how people are making a living outside the mainstream. Then the<a href=\"/t/the-edgeryders-guide-to/327-the-baltic\"> Mission Baltic initiative</a> came along and we got reflections like Dougald, Christopher, Alek, Caroline and others about the interesting green shoots springing up at the intersections of occupation, new forms of democratic participation and innovation. This series was curated into a book (the visual design is less than awsome, with a new cover and some editing it will be a pretty awsome).\u00a0Then it became more focused on <a href=\"/t/how-to-help-each-other-make-a-living-in-a-networked-society-maledge/1947\">fostering collaboration to help one another making a living on the edge</a>\u00a0ahead of \\#LOTE3.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n`Maybe revising some or more of these and posting new material that links to older, but still highly relevant, material most people have not discovered might be a good approach. I would like to engage the communityn in especially the second series. [Noemi] do you remember where we put the instructions for writing the meet the Edgeryder/Edgeryders series?

Actually, being an incubator and facilitating change, if coupled with an agenda what to facilitate, is in my view even a valid strategy for \"bringing on the democratic revolution\".\n\nYet, facilitating interchange and incubation is not what an Edgeryders company would do. This might be cross-financed or supported by the company, but we could also find other ways to support this. From crowdfunding to community contributions to some philantropic money. The defining element of the company is rather, what it sells as a product. Which also applies to social enterprises, just that their product (hopefully) solves a social problem rather than creating one.\n\nIn our case, that product is our new Edgeryders-flavored knowledge product. So to see if that product makes sense, we gotta look at the change done, or facilitated by, this product. And I fear that the change effect of our consultation work is neglible, at least if we accept just any client who wants to hire us (esp. those from the establishment :D). So I propose we should rethink the product to be of higher impact. Or alteratively, to build a self-sustaining association / organization that exists solely to be this mind connector / incubator that you speak of. This one is not a company then: its primary purpose is not to offer and sell a (beneficial or not) product for money, but to fulfill its non-monetary goal, as resource-efficiently as possible ...\n\nThis is pretty blunt startup reasoning, I know.

The friendly people at Chaos Computer Club, who every year make the effort to set up the event, have a cool institution called <a href=\"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2015/wiki/Static:Assemblies\">assemblies</a>, a simple way to make yourself findable at the conference. So, last year we set up an Edgeryders assembly at 31C3, partnering up with the fabulous <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/foodhackingbase/\">Food Hacking Base</a>.\n\nIt was great fun, especially for newbies like myself who were at their first CCC (read <a href=\"http://www.cottica.net/2015/01/06/world-without-marketing-the-hacker-utopia-of-31c3/\">my wide-eyed report</a> if you need any proof). So, we are doing it again. <strong>As a gift to the community, we have reserved two bedrooms with five beds each at <a href=\"http://generatorhostels.com/en/destinations/hamburg/\">Generator Hostel Hamburg</a></strong>, check in on December 27th (the first day of 32C3) and check out on December 30th (the last day). Breakfast is included. You can have these beds free of charge. You will still have to travel to Hamburg, and get your own ticket, though!\n\nIf you want to reserve one of those beds, get in touch with me, I will be dealing with the hostel and take care of the rooming list. The<em>y</em> come with no strings attached, but we might feel like doing something together, just for the hell of it and to give something back to the CCC community.

It is very useful for any kind of publicity I think. Here is what you can pile on:\n\nIf modulab haf a couple of tools you can totally MAKE skateboard decks from scratch there. I haven't gotten around to do this with skateboards yet but it is not terribly difficult. You'll quickly see what you need on youtube. Getting some of the stuff can be a bit of a pain/waiting time. I can fill you in on the details. But if you have it, it is very empowering for a place like modulab - you can make all sorts of cool stuff. Price tag is 300-500 \u20ac for enough to run a workshop I'd say.\n\nNext important consideration: you (almost) never see girls on short boards (the ones you see in the skate parks). My hypothesis is that coordination for tricks is more difficult for women in general. BUT they are riding longboards like crazy, left and right. No one expects them to do tricks on longboards - so they don't have a reason to feel somehow inadequate. Thus longboards/traveling skateboards would more than double the number of riders (sales) and be healthy for the scene on top. If you have a \"make your own board\" workshop - it would be easily possible to cater to each individual's taste.

I agree that stress and suffering are part of life @noemi @odin @Alberto, that stress to some degree even make us thrive, grow @steelweaver. But in the end stress should not become bigger than our coping skills, it should not be overwhelmingly disturbing.\u00a0\n\nIn general, I think of art and creativity as an expression of oneself, an expression of our inner world, our 'being' in the world, our being 'me'. Being authentic is by definition being different from others and thus coping with judgment,\u00a0 the others , the outer world goes along with it.\n\nBut I also think that feeling different, an outsider, more sensitive than others, etc etc .. is often a 'symptom' of trauma, a result of not having our needs met in the past f.ex, wich often results in losing our own connection with our needs, our connection with ourself.\u00a0 This disconnection is trauma, the residu of pain. In my vision many artists are trying to 'heal' themselves through their art - redefine themselves, trying to find a way to become 'whole' again - integrate pain and trauma. Artists are often 'self-healers', they are their own therapists.\n\nWhen the self-healing fails, they might consider exploring the pain and trauma trough different glasses - those of a therapist. Thinking out of the box could help them cope better :-)\n\nThis is the more or less classic, freudian, psychological explanation for 'artistic pain'.\n\nThere is another explanation though, one that is defended by one of the founding fathers of expressive arts therapy S.K. Levine : that art is the expression of our soul, our 'acorn', that we are born with a 'mission', something we want to express, and that the struggle to discover and express this acorn, this individual mission causes pain. Levine thinks we overfocus on pain and trauma caused by environment/youth/parents... We should instead in therapy look more for 'the inborn authenticity, the inborn self'.\n\n(If interesetd in this latter explanation: See <a href=\"https://www.amazon.fr/Trauma-Tragedy-Therapy-Human-Suffering-ebook/dp/B00C0YTBQI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1477407682&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=stephen+k+levine\">Stephen K.

Naomi Klein's \"Nike model\" of outsourcing actual production to job shops while retaining corporate control of IP, finance and marketing; Enterprise 2.0 theories; and military Fourth Generation Warfare doctrines.\u00a0 the problem is, real networks almost always run circles around hybrids.\n\nEnterprise 2.0 doctrines, regardless of the liberatory rhetoric about \"empowerment\" and \"self-managed teams\" preached by the gurus and consultants, are actually put into practice by pointy-haired MBAs.\u00a0 So what you wind up with is warmed-over Taylorism coated in Tom Peters' rhetoric.\n\nMilitary 4GW doctrines are intended as a way for conventional state militaries to incorporate the advantages of networked war-fighting organizations like Al Qaeda, by using new networked communications technology to free up the boots on the ground and empower them to work autonomously in response to their own real-time intelligence.\u00a0 But in practice, as implemented by field grade officers at the \"middle management\" level of the chain of command, the new network technologies are used instead to increase the number of sign-offs required from \"middle management\" officers at battalion or brigade headquarters -- to the extent of actually dictating the specific PowerPoint format of tactical officers' mission proposals.\n\nSo in the end, I believe the state will be \"reformed\" by being hollowed out and retreating from the social sphere, and corporations will be \"reformed\" by the state's imploding ability to provide the subsidies and enforce the cartels and artificial property rights they depend on for survival.\u00a0 Corporations and state will be \"reformed\" the way the Roman Empire in the West was \"reformed\" in the 5th and 6th centuries.\u00a0 The difference, in this case, is that the German tribes and the Gallic peasants working the villas' fields have the equivalent of Star Trek matter-energy replicators.\n\nWe seem to be in a textbook example of Tainter's \"catabolic collapse\" scenario, in which there are no longer social surpluses to repair the decaying infrastructures, and society metabolizes its own muscular, skeletal and nervous tissue until it collapses under its own weight.\u00a0 The difference -- again -- is that new small-scale production and networked organization tech are rendering the old, centralized, capital-intensive infrastructures obsolete.\u00a0 So for the first time the seeds of the Renaissance are sprouting before Rome even finishes falling.\n\nOf course in the interim, the increased pressure of competition from networks may give production workers within the old hierarchies more leverage (their increased power of exit may give them more voice) to force some existing institutions in more libertarian directions.\u00a0 In such cases, corporate and state apparatuses may dissolve into network forms (wither away) rather than being destroyed from outside.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-22 19:55:02", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:48.149385", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 967, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31162, "user_id": 2721, "topic_id": 4544, "post_number": 11, "raw": "<b>\u0421ase studies: \"Uvote\" Ukraine</b>\n\nHi!

As part of the project youth people get acquainted with the basic steps of election campaig. Also the public will be shown presentation videos and be provided with additional materials. The \"Your Voice\" is intendede to lay the foundation of the election culture which is education and mobilization campaign created to answer the question: why should we vote, why every vote is important and how can you protect it. The project will help young people to become more familiar with the nature and technology of the election process and learn how to make critical and rational choice in political preferences and not be afraid to defend their vote. In addition it will show that their votes count, and it will motivate them for more activism.\n\nAfter two campaigns we had such results:\n\n\u2022 More than 60 video messages from famous Ukrainians that were distributed virally in social networks and broadcasted on channel 112 as social videos.\n\n\u2022 80 billboards in Kyiv and 12 lightboxes close to Kyiv universities, 880,000 banners in the Internet; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://pp.vk.me/c620117/v620117687/8401/PSIb5perWXE.jpg\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 333px;\">\u00a0<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://pp.vk.me/c624121/v624121687/36674/5v2tmISuVIA.jpg\" style=\"width: 450px; height: 338px;\">\n\n\u2022 \u00a0Two constituency (where big universities were located: KNEU, KPI) had special information impact of campaign that influenced the turnout and increased it by an average of 16% compared to previous elections.\n\nThe results of the campaign for elections on Oct. 26, 2014 into the Parliament:\n\n- Social Networks where using memes motivated young people not to sell their votes.

(Who are Edgeryders?):</strong> <span>Edgeryders is a growing network of 1600+ people from around the globe building social</span><span> and technical infrastructure to get radically innovative responses to systemic crises off the ground, and keep them </span><span>there. People in Edgeryders are experimenting with everything from urban gardening for food</span><span>security<span>, occupying unused spaces, exploring cryptographic currencies and building spaces for</span></span><span>new kinds of democratic participation.</span></li>\n\n<li><strong>Come nascono? (how did Edgeryders come into existence?):</strong>\u00a0 Edgeryders started out as a research project by the Council of Europe and the European Commission to produce recommednations for how 47 member states (of COe) could respond to youth unemployment. Upon termination, the community spinned it off and built itself a new home on the web. A social enterprise, Edgeryders LBG, has been created to maintain and support the community's infrastructure.</li>\n\n<li><strong>E da quanto? (When did Edgeryders come into existence):</strong> 2011</li>\n\n<li><strong>Quale lo scopo? (What is the purpose?):</strong> To support p2p collaboration around creative responses to ecological, economic and sociopolitical crises threatening our futures. <span>Global unrest, rapid climate change, mass unemployment, outdated governance structures.</span><span> Everyone at the centre says they want innovation, but after reviewing thousands of pages of\u00a0</span><span>ethnographic data, \ufb01rst hand accounts of HOW people are realising these innovative responses to</span><span> systemic crises and instability<span>, we found that the actors you would expect to be there,\u00a0 supporting this work,\u00a0 are </span></span><span>nowhere to be seen. </span>So we decided to just get on with the work of buiding our own mutual support infrastructure, on a massive scale.\u00a0 Peer to peer.</li>\n\n<li><strong>iniziative fino ad ora relaizzate?

(What is the future of Edgeryders?): </strong>For one thing we are building a business offering authorative, authentic and democratically legitimate advice\u00a0 to decision makers in private and public sector organisations. <span>Capitalism is ever changing, but right now it is changing very quickly and quite unpredictably<span>.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 . Out</span></span><span> of these changes will come winners and losers. Schumpeter gave the classic description of this</span><span>process when he called it \"creative destruction\". Anyone who doubts the destruction part need</span><span>only look and what has happened to Blackberry and to Nokia.</span><span>So, \"Business As Usual\" is now totally last century..and the incumbents in the consulting industry</span><span> no longer have all of the answers.</span><span> Einstein </span><span>had a great line about it the insanity of repeating the same process and expecting different results.</span><span>\u00a0At Edgeryders we don't claim to have them all either and we are not saying that they shoul<span>d hire </span></span><span>us instead of them.</span><span>\u00a0The reason for hiring Edgeryders is perspective. The anal<span>ysis we can give is not only un-</span></span><span>obtainable from anyone else bu<span>t it allows <span>our clients to re-interpret <span>the results theu get fr<span>om the</span></span></span></span></span><span>incumbents in a different light. It is only by standing at the edge of a precipice that you start to see</span><span>the path down. The Edgeryders community and corporation are already at the edge....</span><span>We want to help others start on that journey together<span>.</span></span></li>\n\n<li><strong>Come vi legate a unMonastery? (How are Edgeryders tied to the unMonastery?):</strong> The unMonastery is an initiative born out of, and is driven by members of, the Edgeryders community. We asked ourselves how we could bridge the current gap in the innovation support system for pre-market/ radical/ non profit phases of the innovation process. We had also been discussing how we could bridge the growing gap between needing to do meaningful work and make a living. The unmonastery came of of this conversation.</li>\n\n<li><strong>e a living on the edge? (How is Edgeryders tied to Living on the Edge?):</strong> It is clear that we \u2013 the Edgeryders already in the community, and those we will meet along the way \u2013 are powerful allies for each other. Just as importantly, we are\u00a0a comforting presence for each other in times of exhaustion, pessimism and defeat, which are frequent. <strong>So we organise the Living on the Edge events to inpire one another, learn and teach\u00a0 each other new skills and build capacity\u00a0</strong> to get better and better at moving from talk to action. We have new tools at our disposal (Edgeryders-the-company and the unMonastery itself, perhaps others), but even if we did not, one person's usual\u00a0tools and practices are new to another.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li><strong>Tu sarai presente?

I recently\u00a0decided to move back to Italy after over 10 years in Brussels and the rest of my life scattered around Europe. After doing academic research in Sociology and\u00a0managing an art-caf\u00e9 in Brussels I settled for planning (progettazione) and fundraising for projects with a strong social impact. Edgeryders is my new home, and the unMonastery is my daily prospective horizon.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>1. Come ti sei trovata coinvolta in tutto questo? (How did you become part of all this)</strong> Se \"tutto questo\" significa Matera2019, Edgeryders e unMonastery, direi che mi sono trovata coinvolta segendo un misto di curiosit\u00e0, intuito e intraprendenza. Facevo parte del gruppo di giovani che nel lontano 2009 ha iniziato a sensibilizzare la citt\u00e0 di <strong>Matera</strong> sulla possibilit\u00e0 di diventare Capitale europea della Cultura nel 2019. Iniziare a parlare di una manifestazione 10 anni prima dell'evento era per molti una cosa insensata: facevano spallucce perch\u00e9 quell'orizzonte lontano sembrava irrealistico. Adesso il futuro \u00e8 gi\u00e0 qui, e la candidatura di Matera \u00e8 diventata patrimonio comune.\u00a0Mi sono iscritta sulla piattaforma di <strong>Edgeryders</strong> mentre stava finendo il progetto sostenuto dal Consiglio d'Europa e dalla Commissione Europea, ma ho iniziato a essere parte attiva soltanto dopo il raduno annuale della comunit\u00e0 a Bruxelles. Non avevo mai fatto parte di una comunit\u00e0 virtuale, e un misto di timore e di meraviglia mi trattenevano dall'intervenire in rete su temi che mi trovavo interessanti ma di cui ero inesperta. Da quando mi sono lanciata, mi si \u00e8 aperto un mondo: condividere i contenuti e elaborarli insieme porta a una conoscenza condivisa che aumenta il capitale intellettuale di tutti, di chi scrive e di chi legge solamente. Il motore della mia partecipazione online viene dal fatto che il tempo che dedico alla piattaforma \u00e8 un tempo che acquisisce un valore immenso proprio per l'apprendimento reciproco e la consapevolezza che stai ignettando benzina in un motore di un veicolo che sta prendendo un percorso inesplorato. E una spinta collettiva attraverso l'ignoto per contibuire a una visione di futuro condivisa. Quando ho sentito parlare di <strong>unMonastery</strong> durante il raduno di Bruxelles, ho subito pensato a Matera. Quale luogo migliore per ospitare il prototipo di un nuovo tipo di spazio sociale che parlasse al contempo di passato e di futuro? Stiamo creando un significato condiviso di un nuovo tipo di istituzione, perch\u00e9 vediamo che le forme organizzative esistenti che ci circondano non sono riuscite a dare delle risposte soddisfacenti ai bisogni sempre pi\u00f9 pressanti che affronta la societ\u00e0.\u00a0\n\n<strong>2. Il tuo ruolo di legame in cosa consiste? (In what way do you act as a connecting link) </strong>Si diventa \"interfaccia\" quasi naturalmente, un po per carattere, un po per ragioni pratiche: vivo tra Bruxelles e Matera, sono parte attiva della comunit\u00e0 virtuale di Matera 2019 e di Edgeryders, collaboro con Matera 2019 ma non solo. Tutto questo \u00e8 amplificato dal fatto che non sono gelosa dei miei contatti ma credo che mettendo in circolazione le nostre risorse siamo tutti pi\u00f9 ricchi. Facilitare gli incontri, mettere in contatto le persone, indicare progetti simili mi viene naturale, mi rende felice. Per come la vedo io, chi non \u00e8 valido si nuoce da solo. Lo so che quando ci guardiamo intorno vediamo il contrario:\u00a0per questo sceglo di operare all'interno di reti come Edgeryders!\u00a0\n\n<strong>3. Il \"nonmonastero\" una risposta al futuro perch\u00e9? (In what way is the unMonstery an answer to the future)\u00a0</strong>Il futuro \u00e8 un'incognita. In passato \u00e8 stato spesso sinonimo di speranza e di progresso.\u00a0Oggi quest'ignoto puo prendere forme molto pi\u00f9 cupe e ansiogene. Le forme di organizzazione che abbiamo trovato finora hanno dimostrato i loro limiti, si stanno sgretolando o si stanno modificando profondamente: la famiglia, il partito, la scuola, il parlamento, l'impresa. Abbiamo imparato che tutto questo non \u00e8 inamovibile, ed \u00e8 possibile pensare a un nuovo tipo di istituzione - in questo caso che si ispira ai principi monastici del passato, aggiornandoli alle sfide di oggi. Il prototipo di Matera \u00e8 un assaggio di quello che vuole essere l'unMonastery nel tempo: una residenza continua di innovatori che risiedono in una localit\u00e0 e si mettono al servizio della comunit\u00e0 condividendo le proprie competenze in cambio di vitto e alloggio. L'unMonastery \u00e8 un luogo per sperimentare nel tempo nuove risposte a bisogni sociali pressanti di una comunit\u00e0, liberando chi sceglie di fare una scelta cosi radicale dalla precariet\u00e0 lavorativa: non c'\u00e8 arricchimento personale (dal punto di vista monetario) ma viene assicurata una stabilit\u00e0 e una sicurezza sotto altri punti di vista. Per saperne di pi\u00f9, rimando a <a href=\"http://www.rai.tv/dl/RaiTV/programmi/media/ContentItem-389dcf26-e936-4357-a69b-3c329a1eec0a.html\">Radio3Scienza</a>, un <a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/future-thought-the-unmonasterys-200-year-trajectory\">post</a>\u00a0su ER e un <a href=\"http://www.chefuturo.it/2013/10/cosa-gli-innovatori-sociali-possono-imparare-dalla-vita-e-lopera-di-san-benedetto/\">post</a>\u00a0su Chefuturo!\u00a0\n\n<strong>4. Perch\u00e9 hai scelto di partecipare all'esperienza dei 4 mesi, un perch\u00e9 della tua candidatura?</strong>\n\nSono convinta che siamo tutti attori\u00a0del miglioramento della societ\u00e0 che ci auspichiamo: il cambiamento non succeder\u00e0 finch\u00e9 non ci mettiamo in gioco in prima persona. C'\u00e8 chi puo farlo di pi\u00f9, chi un po meno. Inoltre, credo molto nel format della residenza: ho potuto toccare con mano il potenziale creativo di un processo limitato nel tempo e nello spazio per favorire l'approfondimento di una ricerca su un tema specifico. Mentre contribuivo alla realizzazione di tutto cio, ho pensato che il lavoro che sto portando avanti con altre due persone poteva inserirsi benissimo all'interno dell'unMonastery. Non ci abbiamo pensato due volte.\u00a0\n\n<strong>5. LIVING (non Stage) on the Edge \u00e8 il punto di partenza...in cosa si differenzia dall'unMonastery? </strong>Edgeryders funziona con 2 strumenti: la piattaforma online e il raduno annuale offline. Dopo Strasburgo e Bruxelles \u00e8 stata scelta Matera per la terza edizione (#LOTE3). unMonastery \u00e8 un progetto che nasce nella rete degli Edgeryders: visto che ha preso corpo a Matera e che le residenze partono a Febbraio 2014, abbiamo deciso di fare un unPilgrimage (non-pellegrinaggio) per inaugurare il sito dell'unMonastery, creare momentum intorno all'iniziativa sia a livello locale che internazionale e riflettere insieme sugli aspetti pi\u00f9 pratici e pi\u00f9 profondi dell'unMonastery. Una delle tre sessioni del programma di LOTE sar\u00e0 interamente dedicata al \"making-of\" dell'unMonastery.\u00a0\n\n<strong>6. Parlami della candidatura di Matera a capitale della cultura?</strong>\u00a0<strong>(Tell me about Matera's bid to European Capital of Culture)</strong>\n\nLa <a href=\"http://www.matera-basilicata2019.it/it/\">candidatura</a> di Matera \u00e8 un percorso condiviso che nasce nel 2009 da un gruppo di giovani costituiti in associazione culturale per sensibilizzare la citt\u00e0 e il territorio a quest'opportunit\u00e0. Il sostegno regionale e di tutti gli altri livelli aministrativi \u00e8 avvenuto poco dopo: Matera puo vantare il sostegno ufficiale dei 131 comuni della Basilicata, altro che campanilismo! La proposta principale che Matera fa all'Europa \u00e8 TOGETHER TO-GET THERE. INSIEME, abitanti culturali oltre la crisi per un nuovo modello di sviluppo economico che non prescinda dalla cultura. \"Quella di Matera \u00e8 dunque la candidatura responsabile di tutto un territorio che intende contribuire alla ricostruzione culturale, morale e civile del nostro Paese e rafforzare il ruolo della Basilicata, del Mezzogiorno e dell'Italia in Europa\". Il concetto di base, \"INSIEME\", si articola in \"una trama e una struttura del programma della candidatura composte da 5 passaggi che formano un percorso circolare e ricorsivo: futuro remoto, radici e percorsi, riflessioni e connessioni, continuit\u00e0 e rotture, utopie e distopie\" (cf. <a href=\"http://www.matera-basilicata2019.it/it/mt2019/dossier-di-candidatura.html\">dossier</a> di candidatura ufficiale). L'altra cosa da sottolineare \u00e8 che l'Italia \u00e8 il primo paese le cui citt\u00e0 candidate hanno firmato un appello comune, <a href=\"http://www.matera-basilicata2019.it/it/archivi/documenti.html?download=74:perche-italia-2019\">Italia 2019</a>, affinch\u00e9 la candidatura a capitale europea della cultura diventi piattaforma di sviluppo condiviso del sistema paese.\u00a0\n\n<strong>7. E stato difficile portare Living On The Edge a Matera dopo le esperienze estere? (Was it difficult to bring the LOTE to Matera after Strasburg and Brussels)? </strong>I primi due raduni annuali erano nel quadro del progetto del Consiglio d'Europa e della Commissione europea. La scelta di Matera per il primo raduno organizzato interamente dalla rete \u00e8 venuta naturalmente: sono in molti a voler conoscere e scoprire il luogo che ospiter\u00e0 il primo unMonastery al mondo! Inoltre, l'incontro \u00e8 stato facilitato da diversi momenti di interazione tra la citt\u00e0 e gli Edgeryders: c'\u00e8 <a href=\"/t/pop-up-collaborations/342/my-co-living-in-basilicata\">chi</a> ha partecipato a uno scambio di innovatori a Matera, <a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/unmon-matera-co-design-13-today-we-have-given-you-a-big-gift\">chi</a>\u00a0invece \u00e8 venuto per i workshops partecipato in vista dell'unMonastery. Non ultimo, l'incontro tra la <a href=\"http://community.matera-basilicata2019.it\">comunit\u00e0\u00a0online di Matera 2019</a> e quella degli Edgeryders ha facilitato molto la <a href=\"http://community.matera-basilicata2019.it/content/lettera-aperta-ai-materani-da-parte-degli-edgeryders\">costruzione</a> dell'evento LOTE e ha spianato la strada per <a href=\"http://community.matera-basilicata2019.it/content/la-community-di-matera-2019-si-presenta-agli-edgeryders-durante-levento-lote3\">l'incontro</a> che avverr\u00e0 tra pochi giorni! Niente \u00e8 difficile, se si fa insieme - come lo slogan di Matera2019: TOGETHER TO-GET-THERE!\n\n<strong>8. Quante possibilit\u00e0 ci sono per la candidatura? (How many chances are there for Matera2019)\u00a0</strong>Il dossier di candidatura \u00e8 stato consegnato il 20 Settembre al MIBAC, insieme alle altre <a href=\"http://www.capitalicultura.beniculturali.it\">20\u00a0citt\u00e0</a> candidate. Entro la fine dell'anno una shortlist sar\u00e0 selezionata per la corsa finale. La mia testimonianza \u00e8 quella di una citt\u00e0 che ha iniziato il percorso dieci anni prima della data dell'evento, intraprendendo iniziative audaci e innovative, nonostante la scarsit\u00e0 di risorse e l'instabilit\u00e0 politica che stiamo vivendo. C'\u00e8 una comunit\u00e0 che ci crede tantissimo, e abbiamo trovato sulla nostra strada dei sostenitori di grande valore: la Basilicata c'\u00e8, TOGETHER, TO-GET-THERE!\n\n<strong>9. Altre esempi del miracolo Edgeryders?</strong>\u00a0<strong>(Other examples of the \"Edgeryders miracle\")</strong> Non parlerei di miracolo, ma di un lavoro collaborativo facilitato dalla piattaforma e profondamente legato al valore aggiunto dell'intelligenza collettiva e al radicamento territoriale di molti di noi. Sulla piattaforma di Edgeryders vengono prodotti diversi <a href=\"/t/all-our-projects/40\">progetti</a>. Alcuni sono pi\u00f9 di elaborazione di contenuti, come l'elaborazione di un \"<a href=\"/t/how-to-make-meaningful-projects-happen-the-cookbook/328\">Libro</a> delle ricette per realizzare progetti di valore\", altri invece sono pi\u00f9 collegati a un <a href=\"/democracy-camp-europe\">evento</a> specifico, come la proposta del Hackaton in vista delle elezioni del parlamento europeo del 2014. Penso che non ci sia risposta migliore a questa domanda che un viaggio attraverso la piattaforma e la partecipazione diretta ai progetti che pi\u00f9 ispirano!\n\nBen's Answers:\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>My answers to Qs 1-5: . My name is Ben Vickers. a 27 year old based in London. I work across many different projects within different roles,\u00a0for which the only common thread is the desire to build infrastructure and support for new forms of work and living that create\u00a0greater meaning for those participating. I am currently Curator of Digital at the Serpentine Gallery in London, researcher at Brighton University, co-run LIMAZULU Project Space, active member of EdgeRyders\u00a0but most importantly the lead facilitator of the unMonastery project.\u00a0\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong><span><span>how did you get the idea about unMonastery? </span></span></strong>\n\n<span>The idea for the unMonastery arose at the first EdgeRyders unConference in Strasberg in 2012 in a session that included around 20 participants - following a 2 day conference at the Council of Europe. The idea grew from the realisation that in order to support the sort of work individuals were doing outside of pre-existing institutions there was a critical need to build the foundations and infrastructure ourselves. </span>\n\n<span>Many different ideas were discussed and pitched in this first session but it was the idea of a contemporary Monastery that stuck. Firstly because we wanted a powerful idea that was capable of thinking far into the future with a view to learning from the past. Secondly because the multi-purpose role Monasteries were founded on, met with the interdisciplinary way individuals were working to create new projects. Similarly to traditional monasteries; in which scripture was penned, beer was brewed and prays recited, the unMonastery doesn\u2019t act with a fixed set outcomes or rituals - instead it seeks to create value through actions that are relevant to its specific context and create meaning for those participating. Combined with a desire to merge work and life.</span>\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span><span>Since coining the name we have worked to mine the traditions and understand the relationship our project might have to the history of monastic life, so we can better serve small towns and cities throughout Europe. \u00a0\u00a0</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span><strong>numbers: how many there have been requests to participate? </strong></span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>Over the past year over 30 people have put an enormous amount of energy and work into supporting the project and growing the idea, with each passing week this continues to grow. </span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>We have an international team of around 10 committed individuals volunteering their time in order to further the project. For the unMonastery in Matera we will accept 10 applications from individuals who wish to tackle the challenges laid out by the community we have been working with in Matera over the past 8 months. </span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span><strong>how many were they chosen?what is the age group? </strong></span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>The first iteration of unMonastery in Matera will see 10 individuals come together to live and work on projects that aim to solve the challenges set out by the citizens of the city - this group is formed of ages from 18-60. It\u2019s important that the unMonastery is an intergenerational project that can support work between young people and their elders, in order for it to be a success, it is acknowledged that there is much to learn between the different approaches of all generations. </span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span><strong>unMonestary what do you want to prove? as you try to be of help to Matera?</strong><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\nSo many people are struggling do something meaningful and having to hustle, doing work to have a roof over their head and food; essentially taking time away from what drives them. </span></span>\n\n<span>unMonastery offers a deal similar to that of the monasteries of old: lodging, board and time to think and realize ideas and projects, relatively free from the need to make money. This deal is predicated on the idea that individuals should commit such work to solving common and specific problems. In Matera we will aim to create new approaches to energy resource through renewable energy solutions, look to develop innovative solutions to waste management and find ways to create a space for young people to engage with older generations.</span>\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span><span>The gambit behind this collaboration is that living side by side, hackers and Materans discover and explore new paths to make the city more beautiful, liveable, resilient and low cost.</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong><span><span>idea of the monastery is the past, you want to look to the future ... how to combine the two? </span></span></strong>\n\n<span>The unMonastery model is heavily indebted to the concept of hackerspaces, co-operatives where individuals come together to make and invent new things. </span>\n\n<span>These spaces have evolved rapidly over the past 5 years, now spanning the globe. What they lack, is a clear and considered way in which they can benefit the communities in which they reside - by combining the futuristic and competent skills of hackers and makers with the idea of the unMonastery\u2019s social contract we hope to build a long standing institution that meets the needs of local populations and begins to tackle the fundamental challenges of our age. \u00a0</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong><span><span>It will be an isolated experiment or want to be just the beginning? </span></span></strong>\n\n<span><span>This is just the beginning, we are incredibly grateful to the Matera 2019 committee and the citizens of Matera for allowing us to test run and build the first iteration of unMonastery in their city. We hope that this first version we teach us what we need to understand in order to create unMonasteries in many other countries, we actively encourage other groups to adopt and learn from our approach to build unMonasteries in their own towns and cities.</span></span>\n\n", "created_at": "2013-10-22 23:31:14", "updated_at": "2018-06-03 04:16:16.760428", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 5143, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30743, "user_id": 2394, "topic_id": 4060, "post_number": 20, "raw": "<b>When is a market not a market? </b>\n\nI imagine a spectrum. On one end you have  AirBnB, super efficient, scales massively, and makes use of an under utilised resource, but is motivated by the incentive of monopoly profits, and is ethically ambiguous. \n\nOn the other of that spectrum, we have the purely altruistic notion of just giving stuff away, casseroleclub.com facilitates such an exchange. In this case, we cannot question the motivation - it's a beautiful scheme - but we can see that it's going to be hard to fund and sustain. I'm not sure I can think of anything like this at scale.\n\nThe middle ground is a system that keeps a rough account of exchanges, so that people can agree some fairness norm is being observed. This will facilitate the pooling of effort to achieve common goals. Whether this is strictly a market or not is a matter of definition - and separate to the question of whether such a system is a good idea or not.\n\n<span>For me, the word market has no ethical connotations, for others it seems it does, so perhaps a better word can be found. But I do feel that systems which dogmatically reject any notation of reciprocal exchange are defying a kind of economic gravity, and will only work in very limited situations.</span>\n\n@alberto I think your argument that markets are binary, either perfect and socially beneficial or dysfunctional and beyond redemption, is a bit extreme. Firstly, no markets are strictly perfect, yet in many circumstances they seem to work well. Secondly, the specific case of the 'failure' of the project to internalise environmental externalities does not generalise. I'm not talking about internalising negative externalities, or systems that face the same political backdrop as that project, or any scenario related to national provision of healthcare . Really, I think all large scale economic problems including multinationals and governments are a different question, and all attempts to correct markets could be ruined by politics, but the same can be said of any innovation or policy. \n\nAs a point of interest, many people think that Singapore does a good job of using a modified market, in this case in health care, to provide a highly functional system, but I think whether you believe that is irrelevant to whether small-scale local almost-markets to coordinate activity can work.  \n\nRail in the UK is a wonderful example. People hated it when it was publicly owned, they hate now it's privately owned.

Young people need to invent this work because it's hardly available, which is what I did and suddenly grew on me - found natural abilities for community management and going farther than that, I'm now passionate about designing social architectures that most of the time enable rather than offer solution x. It's too hard for any one of us to come up with fix-all solutions to problems in our local communities, so what we do as community builders is creating the space for those solutions to emerge out of citizens diversity, passion and willingness to get things done without asking for permission. Hopefully the workshop will get us all on the same page. If only we can achieve that after 2 months since we started, I think we can call it a win for the time being.

And to learn to trust in the world and behave in a way that promotes trust in the world by others.\n\nI\u2019ve been poor. Very very poor. The kind of poor where you\u2019ve just spent your last krown (Im swedish) on a kilogram of pasta two weeks before the end of the month and don\u2019t know how to pay the rent. Somehow I did manage to be creative during those periods but I remember an omnipresent sense of fear about the future. Not fear of not being able to feed myself, because I could always ask my parents for help in the worst case scenario, but of being too low on the social ladder to have an exciting fun life with exciting sparkly people around me in exciting sparkly fun environments. And fear of lynch mobs.\n\nMy heart sank when the results of the national elections came in. I had always been warned that minorities, people who look different are always scapegoats as soon as the majority feels their livelihoods are at stake. But I saw first one fundamentally wealthy nation attack it\u2019s minorities (Denmark) and then another one go down the ugly road of divisiveness (Sweden) within my lifetime. \u00a0A friend\u2019s grandparents, Holocaust survivors, to this day always have a packed emergency suitcase in their hallway. And in\u00a0 middle school many of my classmates were kids of Polish and Russian academics who had fled their respective countries to make a new life in Sweden. I can completely understand the drive and in fact I find myself always taking into account the possible need to leave very quickly, to escape. I think even my professional choices have been coloured by this in choosing to be in a new space (Tech) where the roles are not really all that cemented yet and the underlying values are ones of sharing and meritocracy.\n\nAt some level my brain is wired to equare money with security, and more money means more personal security- gated communities etc. And I yet never seem to be interested enough to stick to a path that leads to more of it. Actually my story is a string of failed attempts at mad and completely unrealistic projects that dont pay. First I decided I wanted to build an Online distribution platform for short films and interactive content, it was to be called the Digital Arts Mirror or DAM. \u00a0I tried to build it by writing plan after plan and pitching them to different parts of the public and private sector. What\u2019s wierd is that people actually humored me and were\u2019nt too condescending so I just kept going, running around between different film festivals, bullshitting my way into meetins etc. At some point I had managed to get together a group of 10 people, and we would have lots of meeting that never lead to anything until eventually it fizzled out. The reason being plain and simple that I didn\u2019t have the production or programming skills to just go ahead and make it happen without needing to raise capital, to pay someone to do it for me. And it was too all over the place for anyone to want to invest their time into it. I was in Engineering school at the time, doing the bare minimum to scrape by with most of the courses. Then a friend started doing her master\u2019s \u00a0(she\u2019s a bit older than me) on sexual fetisches and that lead to alot of interesting conversations about the brain. I mentioned this to a guy I was dating at the time and he handed me, the minds eye, a book by Daniel Dennet. I talked my way into the neurobiology and cognitive neuropsychology courses at the Medical university and I think it was the first time I really put any serious effort into studiying. I was completely obsessed.\n\nObviously alot of stuff was going on, I was living with a very self-destructive friend who I had to to cut off after they threw snakes down my mailbox (yes, they did). And the final rush of the University program was up ahead with classmates finishing their degrees and heading off for stellar careers with me feeling very sorry for myself and very aware of the lack of any sellable practical skills after the DAM fiasco. So I did just that, felt sorry for myself and threw a full on tantrum in a computer lab at Uni. That set of a cascade of events I can\u2019t really get into here but it ended up with me landing my first grown-up paid gig post college. Not a job, but a paid gig devising and implementing my own great project in a very hierarchical organisation with lots of strange rules designed to keep wildcards like myself out. And it was a position that wasn\u2019t there for me to fill, I didn\u2019t go looking for it. I think I was lucky to some extent. Just having the right mix of non-mainstream experiences and skills, a flamboyant personality and being at the right place at the right time. But the place was what is considered an elite university. And a large chunk of the reason I could afford to be there and also fail at all kinds of experiments is because of the conditions we have in Sweden: university is free of charge for citizens and you are entitles to take a loan and grant from the state to Study if you are accepted into any university course or program. Im eternally grateful that it exists and hope it never ever goes away so others can have the same space.\n\nBack to money. The experience living on an ice-breaker with 12 lovely, warm people changed something for me- being in a nurturing environment where most never had any money taught me a few things about myself and about what makes me happy. It also taught me that you need to invest either money, or alot of time into creating a good social environment for yourself. You have to be engaged and excite others about it in either case, but you need time and or money. And if you\u2019re working a dayjob, the time part goes out the window...and so does money because let\u2019s face it, unless you\u2019re an investment banker you\u2019re never really going to make enough money to do what I want to do. So my way is to try to put alot of time and engagement into creating events that people I want to be surrounded by and learn from, will get excited enough to attend and that everyone else values enough to fund.\n\nAnd finally the lynch mob. I\u2019m still terrified of it. Even more so after learning more about the way the brain and the world are wired. But I\u2019ve decided to try to do something about it. It\u2019s really a nuisance because I am no do-gooder- and I\u2019m still trying to figure out how to build a life where I have access to the people and things that make me feel good (great food, nice clothes, big home with big windows and high cieling etc). My brain is wired to equate money with security but my mind, aided along by my husbands optimism, has done the thinking and come to the conclusions that my access to all of those things I care about is determined by changes that happen on a global scale. And my mind also knows that unless I get in the game and try to affect change so that life doesn\u2019t completely suck for those of us who are in the proverbial middle class, there\u2019s a node missing in the needed network. And my heart knows that someone somewhere on the other side of the plane, maybe a cousin of someone I went to school with in one of the 10 countries I grew up in, is paying for me to live this life. And it tells me that our fates are connected that cousin and I and that in the big picture it\u2019s way better if we\u2019re both ok- if that means I have a little less of the great food that\u2019s ok.\n\n", "created_at": "2011-11-09 16:40:46", "updated_at": "2017-09-01 04:45:27.129710", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1426, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 55.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3791], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31978, "user_id": 2569, "topic_id": 1882, "post_number": 22, "raw": "Agree.

They are growing by steady rates, with the busiest months of the year being spring and autumn months: about 110 new followers versus the lower 70 throughout the rest. \u201cCoincidentaly\u201d that\u2019s when the biggest community projects have been taking place - Spot the Future, the unMonastery or Living on the Edge series.\n\nPopular posts bring the numbers up of course, like the major boom last week, most likely due to Nadia\u2019s posts on <a href=\"/t/shaping-the-future-of-digital-social-innovation-in-europe-what-was-discussed-during-digisi/4118\">Europe\u2019s digital agenda</a>.\n\nIn terms of tweets performances, I'm not using any app (Said used BufferApp), but you don't need an app to see that the <a href=\"/t/edgeryders-social-media-summary-report-april-15th-june-15th/3401\">same trend </a>as last spring is going on - very few RTs (avg 2-4 based on my intuition); we pushed more with Lote4 stuff and less so during Dec-Jan.\u00a0\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Goo.gl links</h3>\n\nWe don't do trackable short links with religiosity, only for content we consistently push out. Now, over Sept and Oct we had a proper social media team who offered to help push out the short links, so you see the numbers are consistent throughout. In Jan-Feb however, content mostly drives itself (only from @edgeryders official account), with bigger variation. True, the 176 clicks in the right column are due to paid work opportunity. The differences are not so big though (I had pushed minimally throughout Jan-Feb), and the opportunity that I see is that we only need to tightly mobilize half a dozen people to commit to a daily/ every other day task of sending out the tweets to maximize potential. After all, some coordination in a community is crucial to achieve any goals, otherwise we would be a community.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/8/87805a9e9234c3c9a5c61912824f73079fb0c17d.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"227\"><br>\n\nAny thoughts or remarks you can add?

The 200sq/Ft Dojo Studio (Including the mats) weighs 15kg and can easily be extended. The project with the KungFu school was the simplest form the Dojo could be used in and to show how it could draw people to a space. The Piccianello event would take the Mobile Dojo into the Sassi. Work with a local shop owner that @FeliceFulco is in contact with to direct the event towards local food produce.</span></span>\n\n<span><span>There is a lot of writing and thoughts I would like to share. The concept in mind for the Dojo is a portable Monastery capable of documentation and if at all possible live streaming. A physical space that can be easily transported and is un-specific enough to be molded to fit the needs. </span></span>\n\n<span><span>The term Dojo has an educational heritage which translates to </span><span>a concept signifying 'way', 'path', 'route\u2019,</span><span> meaning a place of any practice. What this allows, along with the concept of Mobile, is a connection between the different practices that can be applied within a Dojo \u201cOur Mobile place of practice\u201d. The Dojo acts as both a physical and mental space, with the physical space creating a peer to peer learning environment, and the mental developing resilience and discipline. The Mobile Dojo has a multi-skill flexibility, meaning all communities can participate.</span></span>\n\n<span><span>Harry</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-05-28 10:58:38", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:01.595640", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1121, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2489, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 2456, "post_number": 1, "raw": "This is the public group where we are building the spot the future initiative and where project related documents, call for submissions and calls for e.g. community participation will be published.

I'm Jeff Mowatt and I run a social business in the UK and a Linkedin group on Social Business and For Benefit Corporations\u00a0\u00a0 I offer a few thoughts on the matter of WE and collective action from our own activism.\n\nThe starting point for this was <a href=\"http://www.p-ced.com/1/about/background/\">a critique of traditional capitalism which is now a manifesto</a> from which I offer a few key points:\n\n\"Manipulation of numbers, represented by currency/money, allows writing \u201cnew\u201d money as needed. \u00a0There is no tangible asset, or anchor. \u00a0There are only numbers, managed by whomever might maneuver into position to do so. \u00a0Economics came to be based on numbers, rather than real human beings.\"\n\n\"On that basis, capitalism trumped people and therefore trumped democracy. \u00a0Democracy is about people, who since Descartes are considered necessarily real, rather than numbers which are not necessarily real. \u00a0An imaginary construct, numbers, rule a real construct, people. \u00a0That arrangement allows for disposal of real human beings, in the name of the imaginary construct.\"\n\n\"Economics, and indeed human civilization, can only be measured and calibrated in terms of human beings. \u00a0Everything in economics has to be adjusted for people, first, and abandoning the illusory numerical analyses that inevitably put numbers ahead of people, capitalism ahead of democracy, and degradation ahead of compassion.\"\n\n\"Each of us who have a choice can choose what we want to do to help or not. \u00a0It is free-will, our choice, as human beings.\"\n\n<a href=\"http://www.p-ced.com/1/about/history/\">The paper, which was delivered to the White House in Septerber 1996</a> ends with these words:\n\n<span>\"It is only when wealth begins to concentrate in the hands of a relative few at the expense of billions of others who are denied even a small share of finite wealth that trouble starts and physical, human suffering begins. It does not have to be this way. Massive greed and consequent massive human misery and suffering do not have to be accepted as a givens, unavoidable, intractable, irresolvable. Just changing the way business is done, if only by a few companies, can change the flow of wealth, ease and eliminate poverty, and leave us all with something better to worry about. Basic human needs such as food and shelter are fundamental human rights; there are more than enough resources available to go around--if we can just figure out how to share. It cannot be \"Me first, mine first\"; rather, \"Me, too\" is more the order of the day.</span>\"\n\nMy blog, <a href=\"http://socialbusiness.socialgo.com/magazine/read/you-me-we-ethics-and-people-centered-economics_5.html\">You, me, we, ethics and people-centered economics</a> is a chronology of the next 15 years leading to the death of founder Terry Hallman in August 2011.\u00a0\n\nJeff\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-08 09:13:12", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:46.781003", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 531, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30061, "user_id": 115, "topic_id": 1767, "post_number": 20, "raw": "<b>a modest epiphany</b>\n\nhello all you sexy euro beasts:\n\n<span>I was jogging on the treadmill when a reasonable</span><span>\u00a0idea struck me.

Markers are getting confused and transposed. And eventually you do become an elderly at some point, don\u2019t you? So definitely adulthood is not forever (hopefully).\n\nAlso, the very social meaning I intended to attach to this is that you do carry on society\u2019s burden on your shoulder. Just to give a self evident example: it\u2019s so difficult for fresh graduates in several countries of Europe now to find a traditional graduate job upon leaving university. This used to be a much more straight forward process. So you might be brought to think that YOU are not good enough to succeed. You probably know that the unemployment rate for young graduates is very high, and many of your friends are experiencing your difficulties too, but FIRST you perceived it as a personal matter, no matter how strongly public debate is telling you that you should find your way through individualised strategies- or maybe exactly because of this. The whole rethoric of individualization (which is something different from individualism) fails to recognise the added effort YOU have to carry on your shoulder. I am not sure whether this brings you to be heroic, but it\u2019s Something. The ideal society (for me, at least) is the one which gives the extraordinary talented ones space to \u00a0realise their bright ideas, but without leaving anyone falling behind. The current economic and historic moment should be much fairer with both. Yes, we do need each other and sorry for the abrupt simplification and division into two, what I mean here is that not everyone is strong enough to actively fight for their own realization, and institutions should/could be much more supportive here. I see this becomes very political but in such a broad way that Edgeryders could help too in converging suggestions and factual proposals.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-23 09:02:42", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:03.013245", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 341, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [7110], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3418, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 3385, "post_number": 1, "raw": "it happened sometime in 2012 when my friend Andrei pointed out to me that Edgeryders are looking for good contributions to their online conversation and if I do well, I might meet them in real life. I started reading. Swimming in this ocean of content, ideas, visions, projects, debates - and tried to add a coin to it. It worked. I got to Stockholm and for two days participated in one of the most advanced, socially responsible talks ever - done in a small group of people, mostly doing very informal, very off-the-path things. I liked it.\n\nI'm a political scientist and journalist with a university paper stating that. I am a journalist, freelancing mostly about culture (music, movies, literature) and architecture in the political and social context. This is what I wanted to do for my PhD. The Uni turned out to be too much of a burden for me - random classes to be taught, questions what architecture has to do with politics were just tiring. During my studies I started moving a bit - studies in Iceland opened my cognitive perspectives and fed me with ideas about civil society and cities as political and social phenomena. Then I came back to Lublin, where I used to study and live, and got into the leftist scene: working for a squat, helping out the most interesting NGO, doing cultural jobs, finally writing a lot of things. Academia was giving us time to do many things. And we did it.\n\nI lived in quite some cities, taking various jobs, always seeking for sense and social benefit in them. I always wanted to contribute to something meaningful. I always believed that even the small things I organised, helped with, made myself - would have a value. Money is secondary. Energy is the asset that requires being directed in the right place. Otherwise, you waste your precious time.\n\nAfter having to do with ngos who almost destroyed my faith in their mission, I had to jump back in the Edgeryders community and rethink everything. It's a challenge. It's different. And I do believe in it. Och, I so do.\n\nI will be doing the communication and media-related work for Edgeryders. I will be asking you for the <a href=\"/t/countonme-july-headlines/3347\">headlines </a>and sending them every morning. I will welcome you <a href=\"/task-3475\">in Matera</a> where I would stroll the streets a month before your arrival in search for chairs, people, enthusiasm, right type of pasta and mozarella.

But that is perhaps better done via skype some day in detail. Perhaps I can do a short call with @Ben in the near future to get his take. I'd posit my \"Rules of the Hand\" (working title). ;)\n\nIt goes like this: 5 fingers don't make a hand. It is good if some are similar, but you need the odd opposable thumb, and you need something that holds them together and allows them to support each other. If you accept that man is so successful, not because he has a bunch of fingers, but (among other things) because of the finger's teamwork as a HAND - then it would seem prudent to focus more on the hand, and less on the finger. One way to do that would be to split income nominally generated by one person into 5 parts of which the person only keeps 1/5th and distributes the rest to a minimum of 4 other people. They each do the same thing until you get under some threshold. You'd still have some \"long range tax\" that supports the rest of the \"body\" but it would be significantly lower than now. Permanent collaboration with one or two people would be okay from a tax perspective, but if you don't change most of your collaboration partners relatively often you'd be paying a slightly higher tax. All this would hopefully be relatively easy to police, as the people you share with can act as witnesses for your claims. The intended result is that resources would be \"smeared out\", and there would be a large incentive to help each other, and connect people effectively. If you can think of ways to \"game the system\" please feel free to tear it apart. :)\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-17 18:17:42", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:05.289923", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 585, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [8191], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20163, "user_id": 3265, "topic_id": 463, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>An Insider's View</b>\n\nHi Pauline,\u00a0\n\nFirst of all, I am very happy to know that one of my classmates has been to my country and lived there for so long! Secondly, please trust me when I say I totally understand how much trouble and frustration you and your family might have faced. I have studied in the USA for over six years now, and it was very difficult for me in the beginning. However, at least America is organized and has more serious regulations. On the other hand, China is this crazy place with things that I don't even know how they work XD.\u00a0\n\nThe healthcare system and medicine and food safety are two of the most serious issues that is occuring in China right now (along with hundreds of other ones...). If you think about it, China is a country that is both old and young. Modern medicine, science, social structure, and etc didn't become a thing until very recent in the history. The China now was established in 1949, and after that the country went through a four-year famine and a ten-year cultural revolution. By the beginning of 1980s, the entire country was behind\u00a0on technology, education\u00a0and many other things. Medicine --\u00a0a\u00a0crucial area \u00a0-- unfortunately brought harm to many people due to the doctors' lack of professional knowledge. Many people in my generation, including one of my best friends, suffer hearing loss because of\u00a0antibiotics over-use. I have a permenant\u00a0arm injury myself because of the improper obstetrics practice.\u00a0\n\nToday, the relationship between the doctors and the patients are super intense in China. The patients\u00a0and their families\u00a0would blame everything on the doctors and the hospitals if they think they are not treated \"correctly\". There are even groups of so called \"professionals\" who are paid by the patients' families to make a mess at the hospital: break things and even physically harm the doctors.\u00a0\n\nI am not quite sure exactly how this works, but it seems to me that Chinese doctors like giving the patients all kinds of pills. It is very common in China to see a doctor just for a common cold, and you would recieve medicine for that\u00a0(I\u00a0never took anything when I was sick in America). People say that the doctors recieve benefits from giving medicine, but don't mark my words on this. I can definetly do more research later.\u00a0And then, there is the question of how safe\u00a0the drugs and vaccine in some places are. But I'm afraid that is out of my knowledge.\u00a0\n\nI'm not sure if any of this information is helpful. But one thing for sure, it is not just because you and your family are foreigners that getting a treatment is confusing and frustrating, it is becasue the entire system is a mess, even for locals like me.\u00a0\n\nLujia\n\n", "created_at": "2016-04-24 02:50:16", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:52.302582", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 518, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4228, "user_id": 854, "topic_id": 4195, "post_number": 1, "raw": "...I summarise here, per @Alberto 's request, a conversation I was having with @sociotechnicalmike about the best strategy to involve the medical community in our project.\n\nIn facts, Mike asked whether any clinical involvement is envisaged for the project, and specified that his concern is &lt;&lt;with the \"politics\" of a \"revolutionary\" proposal&gt;&gt;.

What are your thoughts?\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-03-11 12:35:17", "updated_at": "2018-05-26 13:08:40.685186", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 169, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20812, "user_id": 2201, "topic_id": 4576, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Update 24/06/15</b>\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/8/848cefb8846d3ce02996354240e0133ac285fcea.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"458\"><br>\n\nWhat a night, what a night!\n\nWe gathered at Freedom square at 6PM yesterday and after all of the arrested activists were freed and joint us, we marched towards Baghramyan ave where the Presidential House is located. There were around 20 000 people(versus 2000-3000 people that gathered the day before) mostly young people of 20-30 y.o. with no political affiliation as well as families with kids(I was so glad I took along my daughter despite everybody advising me against it!).\n\nI explain this by the fact that media(TV/Radio) did not cover the event and the gathering of yesterday was not even mentioned except the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1416322305362535/1416337462027686/\">facebook event</a>\u00a0and older people do not use social media, so it took some time for the older people to join, but they were eventually there too!\u00a0\n\nThe way to the Presidential House was of course blocked and barricaded by the water cannons and fully armed policemen. All the streets leading to the building were in fact closed. So we stopped there and the peaceful march turned into a peaceful sit in with some awesome guys playing drums throughout the night that gave the gathering an amazing uplifting spirit. We danced and sang and chanted slogans like \"<em>Free and Independent Armenia</em>\" and \"<em>We are the owners of our country</em>\".\u00a0\n\nNothing really happened till we left at midnight though I couldn't help wondering why there are no famous people joining us as I strongly believe they would uplift the people's spirits and help them stay secure(together with families with children - as Armenians have traditional values and I don't think they would attack us if there were children among us).\u00a0\n\nWhen I got home after midnight, some activists did invite influential actors and artists to join and they finally did, together with some priests and other famous people. This was a living wall to protect the peaceful crowd from any aggression from the side of the police/army.\u00a0\n\nThere were even some deputies and the minister of Education and Science that tried to join but this was met with the crowds' shouting \"Get out from here! You are not one of us! There is no place for you among us\". So well done! As indeed those politicians are part of the problem and were only trying to win the people's hearts by being there. Where were they on June 22 early morning? It's not like they did not know what was happening at that time!\n\nPeople also built barricades out of garbage cans they brought from all over the district to protect themselves from the police attack. I even noticed a girl with a tennis racket, which was apparently meant to be used as a weapon.\u00a0\n\nThe best part is that everyone was collaborating and helping each other - early morning the demonstrators cleaned the whole street from the rubbish, they are taking shifts, bringing food and drinks for the ones staying there. A great initiative was posted online today from <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10207520501350328&amp;set=a.10201097189651550.1073741827.1223056803&amp;type=1&amp;fref=nf\">a bar on Baghramyan ave</a> inviting all the protesters to come and drink water, charge their phones and get some rest if they want.\u00a0\n\nTo cut it short, the protest was quite a success and it is apparent that the government will have to reconsider the decision to raise the rates of electricity. But this is not all we ask for: we also demand that the chief policemen in charge of June 22 operation be fired and initiating a criminal case against him and other policemen who made lots of illegal actions during the arrests as well as in the police stations where the activists were held for 7 hours or more even though no charges were made and they were considered witnesses only(some were eventually charged with a criminal case).\u00a0\n\nWe are gathering today again at 18:30 at Freedom Square and will march to Baghramyan ave to raise awareness and involve more people.

We become more ready to serve than to rule, altruistic and compassionate. </span></span>\n\n<span><span>Human beings (men or women), when they awaken the feminine energy dormant in every human being develop the following traits of character: </span></span>\n\n<span><span>Non-violence, truthfulness, sweetness of tongue, absence of anger, tranquillity, refraining from malicious gossip, kindness to all creatures, nonattachment to the objects of senses, mildness, abstaining from idle pursuits, sublimity, forgiveness, absence of malice and feeling of self-importance, calm, balanced.</span></span>\n\nThis feminine energy leads to a perennial physical state, free of ups and downs, devoid of complexes, tensions, anxieties, neuroses, and fears, with a firm grip on the mind and body, on emotions, passions, and intractable lusts.\n\nSo you see, if we were more aware about the existence of this possibility for the human being, and if we all learned to develop its potential and process, the world would be very different from the one in which we live in now. This is how I visualize a matriarcal society, based on this feminine power, empowering humanity. How do I know that this could be a possibility for the human race?, Because there are currently many men and women in this perennial physical state. It exists. A majority of human beings could eventually evolve to show a broader and more healthy attitude toward the problem of existence, and this would change everything. The blueprint of evolution is indelibly stamped on the brain. We need only to learn how to read it in order to design our institutions and lifestyles.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-24 02:06:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:45.713403", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 667, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21968, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 3902, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Yes please!</b>\n\nHave a look today and let's agree on everything so we can get started?\n\n", "created_at": "2015-01-08 12:00:20", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:02.414125", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 21, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [20408], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19002, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 4144, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>Yes please</b>\n\nThat would be great!\n\n", "created_at": "2015-03-06 09:22:20", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:45.937563", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 10, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [18997], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14697, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1607, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>4 more models to the Game of Man</b>\n\n<strong>Nicolas Hel</strong> is playing the Game of Man.

This takes intelligent design, but, for example, where working with groups, you can use GNH ('H' is for Health/Happiness) as a guideline for \u00a0the design of the Metric which can be based on questionaire instances every time a given group meets or at stages in a process (1 month, 3 months, 6 months) - are people getting healthier, happier, fitter, more productive, do they feel they have more choices etc etc. Thats one simple example.\u00a0\n\ne/SROI takes what @CommonFutures is talking about above. There are a bunch of softwares that monitor the electricity usage in the building and from what I read @Elf already knows his way round them. This service could, hypothetically, be extended to businesses in a municipality as a service whereby they in turn channel their CSR funds into unMon related projects. I once wrote a short piece for company CFOs whereby you can incentivise energy savings by channelling percentages of that saving into health programs and company-social services for employees. This requires a process of monitoring the energy usage in buildings, and with an IOT/Sensor head on your team you could do amazing and valuable work in this respect. @Alberto, your friend at Lote2 in Brussels,EU head, the older man, French-speaking, he works with exactly this kind of technology and was very interested in our conversation at the time. Perhaps if you remember his name we can revive that chat here.\u00a0\n\nIn addition, there is the general lived environment, is it nicer, more amenable to the 'good life' and how is that measured? What is being protected in terms of environment - species, heritage sites, SAC site maintenance etc, how is it being done, how is this a saving compared to not doing what is being done? All part of this kinnd of make up.\u00a0\n\nBut I'm still on the wrong track I guess, so -\n\n@CommonFutures, you are right about the gov. position re:revenue generation, its a crux everytime going into these situations and something of a Catch22 seeing as once revenue is generated than the likelihood of your being legally pigeon-holed as some form of 101 'company' increases significantly. Getting around this requires a new form of structure I reckon, and an angle to approach state/political interest while accomodating both community groups and the unMonastery model specifically may be to form some kind of municipal community-corporate identity that can work between community focussed groups and the town in which they operate...\n\nWhat you are saying about alternative currency operation - this is where it gets very interesting. Making the distinction between non-profit and for-profit mean something might hinge on the use of (initially) small scale alternative currencies based on abundance. This works for everyone as long as somewhere there is a revenue angle being created to balance the thing in the eyes of state and local chamber-types.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-09-04 16:05:49", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:24.711709", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 623, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11861, "user_id": 176, "topic_id": 1303, "post_number": 3, "raw": "That's no problem Noemi :)\n\n", "created_at": "2012-02-13 11:48:11", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:08.017727", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 7, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [9884], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11618, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 755, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>The attitude you bring to the party</b>\n\nI agree with Alberto, epsecially in terms of having low risk starting points. \u00a0Because everyone brings to a situation their own place on a kind of continuum between a willingness to risk getting burned by someone in order to increase the possibilites of fruitful new relationships, and being protective of oneself to the point that you only \"let someone in\" after they have demonstrated in some way their worthiness.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-10-14 15:19:27", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:06.806369", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 81, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [9116], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3577, "user_id": 1692, "topic_id": 3544, "post_number": 1, "raw": "We <a href=\"/t/kiderwind/581\">initially</a> planned it from the 22nd to the 27th of September but as it is quite hard to find human resources we propose to postpone it during the Lote4 hackathon.\n\n<span>For the past couple of months we\u2019ve been working with Francesco Musico at unMonastery to assist in the project development of KIDERWIND, an open-source project which aims to harness the wind at high altitude in order to generate power.

More than ever, being here in Jozi is reinforcing a feeling of the \"rich present\": Internet-supported state of being in several physical, time and perception zones simultaneously. \u00a0A kind of split vision of the present and\u00a0future unfolding in real time.\u00a0\n\nFrom the various presentations and discussion my understanding is that participants are here to sketch processes and concepts, and make sense of how to align their efforts for the work ahead. The goal is to develop a shared framework for figuring out how inhabitants of the hugely diverse countries on the African continent can be involved in, and go about, shaping their trajectories into a prosperous (as defined by their own value systems and priorities) and peaceful future. There are many different approaches towards thinking about the future and they serve different purposes. I will be going into them (and the related methodological issues) in more detail in the next post.\u00a0\n\nI have taken to heart the importance of devices that allow us to surface the hidden assumptions and beliefs that underpin how we understand the world and interpret any information presented about it. Why? because it is difficult to have a meaningful, forward looking conversation if we do not have some shared understanding of the basics that we both accept to be credible/trustworthy. As well as processes that help us understand and reshape our own thinking and the frameworks through which various options are deemed credible, desirable or feasible. Facts are never neutral as they are always interpreted through some lens.\u00a0\n\nThe second is how\u00a0restricting ourselves to the Western mindset, mythologies, philosophies and understanding of human relationships robs us of valuable knowledge and tools that are critical to our being able to respond to systemic crises. I will be writing a bit more about this in a coming post.\u00a0\n\nVery roughly these are some of the trends/discussion threads that have emerged and that I think are especially interesting. They popped up in the fringe conversations and I am highlighting them because I noticed that, among the main speakers, the techno-social changes seem to be given a much lower priority than I would have expected. The entire continent is about to go online in a big way, and in the past ten years we have seen remarkable developments shaped, driven or facilitated by technological development. In some cases African countries are ahead of the global curve. This, I think, deserves the limelight. It certainly caught my attention.\n\n<strong>The State and Money</strong>. The notion of a \u201cnational currency\u201d is disappearing with mobile technology and alternative currencies \u2013 if not disappearing then adapting. We are seeing post-national means of exchange arising, as well as sub-national ones. By now everyone has heard of BitCoin, but did you know that cross-border mobile money transfer between Tanzania and Rwanda is already happening? Liquidity exchanges for poorer people are also driving innovations\u00a0such as\u00a0<a href=\"http://koru.or.ke/bangla\">Bangla-Pesa</a>: an alternative currency developed in a Mombasa slum which incurred a violent reaction from the state before anybody really understood what was really happening, and why. In the Edgeryders community, this resonates our own <a href=\"/u/matthias\">@Matthias</a>'s <a href=\"/makerfox\">Makerfox</a> based on a homebrewed network bartering algorithm.\n\n<strong>The State and Learning. </strong>There are many more micro-alternatives, many more approached to learning and education and a large activist community (MOOCs etc).\u00a0Corporations like Google are increasingly funding spaces where alternatives are formulated and civic innovation harnessed to compensating for state failure to provide adequate education to citizens e.g. barcamps. These spaces tend to shape agendas that are technocentric and create government demand for those companies products and services. Effectively policy gets set outside the locus of elected representatives.\u00a0Aside from issues of democratic legitimacy, there are consequences of the inevitable techno-centricity that comes with tech companies shaping the agenda: you miss positive externalities like mythology shaping/transmission, social negotiation, teaching and other \u201cfuzzy\u201d things without which control of nation states on the population is undermined for better or for worse. This is part of a bigger <a href=\"http://techrights.org/2013/08/01/south-africa-and-microsoft/\">push by commercial software vendors like Microsoft to embed proprietary software in the educational systems of African countries</a> including South Africa...with potentially disastrous security implications.\n\n<strong>The State and Citizenship.</strong> There is a trend towards citizens exercising sovereignty \"in remote\", living anywhere and still being able to access the protections and other functions of the state. Examples are Estonia offering digital citizenship, or people like Edgeryders community member\u00a0<a href=\"/u/mike_gogulski\">@Mike Gogulski</a>\u00a0who manage to live outside it successfully (read this <a href=\"http://www.vice.com/read/a-bum-without-a-country-0000326-v21n5\">recent VICE article about Mike</a>). Place shackled citizens: e.g. feudalism. Identification: crypto/ blockchain ids. Consequences: struggle to control algorithms, cultures and servers . \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n<strong>The State and Big Data.\u00a0</strong>Big data are being used to predict actions, and even conflicts. Cases were mentioned of preemptive strikes based on prediction, jeopardising individual right to due process. Some of them have become a self-fulfilling prophecy, exacerbating the conflicts they were mean to quell.\u00a0\n\n<strong>The big ideas that inform our world view.</strong>\u00a0How are they changing as stories and narratives that challenge what we have learned about ourselves and others are made accessible? Which narratives and mythologies can we draw from the rich tapestries of African cultures\u00a0in our quest to build a more resilient and equitable future for the planet's inhabitants?\n\nThe question hanging in the air is about the role of the nation state, on the African continent and beyond. One participant from Tanzania predicts that people will become loyal to entities that are larger than nation states and span across many of them, and others that are smaller than states themselves. This would lead to a sort of distributed pattern of ownership/loyalty/affiliations. Who then does conflict arbitration, standard settings etc? And what of nation states that have been captured by predatory elites, and their narrow interests? Will people withdraw their loyalty from them, given that alternatives are more and more available? Does it make sense to try to recapture the state for the creation of more equalitarian, representative states? Is it more efficient to work <em>with</em> them, or <em>around</em> them? Or is a combination of all strategies, depending on context, the way to go?\n\n", "created_at": "2014-05-28 09:47:25", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 23:50:26.141031", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1148, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 30.8, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 4, 2104], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25106, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 1188, "post_number": 10, "raw": "<b>awesome</b>\n\nNadia also says this would be the greatest option..\n\n", "created_at": "2013-06-17 16:01:57", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:18.849501", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 14, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [24256], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14658, "user_id": 2, "topic_id": 1930, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Cork meeting</b>\n\nI'm going to Cork on Tues to meet MOB and his boss at 2pm to discuss further...", "created_at": "2013-09-12 17:38:37", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:22.679396", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 22, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13888, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 3492, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>agree</b>\n\nI agree with nadia.

How do I know my calculation is correct?\u201d\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/0/0b7c6f1b68b8b49d1af4051f303a7703d64ad48e.png\" width=\"689\" height=\"278\">\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe checked their own specific situations and asked questions like:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\tHow did you receive the information that you had to follow a regulation procedure?</li>\n\n<li>\tHave you ever seen the procedure?</li>\n\n<li>\tDid you try following the procedure on your own or you asked a professional to do the work for you?</li>\n\n<li>\tWere you able to understand what the procedure was asking and were you able to find that data?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\u00a0\n\nPlanning and running interviews was a lot of work but it also was extremely helpful from a design perspective. It helped us understanding a lot of nuances about the shop owners\u2019 issues when reading and trying to fill the procedure and their needs, desires and commitment in solving the accessibility problem of their shops.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d love to let anyone come into our shop\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst off we will try to solve this issue on our own, and build the ramp ourselves. Only if necessary we will eventually contact a professional to do the work for us\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it would be great to have the possibility to fill the procedure online, maybe on the website of the Municipality of Milan, with a tool that does the calculation while you enter your data\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nBelow you can see a radar chart showing the topics we covered during the interviews, any of the shapes is a representation of the profile of a shop owner we interviewed. By stacking the shapes you can see topics (issues, needs) that are more relevant (the highest relevant towards the outside of the radar).\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5614cb09718330a39f7d362a87a86c3c23cdb45c.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\">\n\n\u00a0\n\nBelow you can see another chart that re-thinks the Minerva profile we initially invented, adding the real issues and needs of the shop owners we interviewed. Finally we have a real life Minerva profile that we can design a better procedure for!\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/0/09be3fd709895daa0de67509839bfd339909387f.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\">\n\nWhy was this helpful? Because it\u2019s only with this knowledge that we can proceed in designing a tool to make the process for regulation procedure easier.\n\nAt the moment we\u2019re using all this insights to create a prototype that we will show and test publicly in Milan on Wednesday, the 12th of July.\n\nPlease come at the meeting to share with us your questions and feelings, they will be extremely helpful and needed to design a solution that better fits you.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-07-10 09:59:11", "updated_at": "2017-10-05 16:22:03.667096", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 901, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 36.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11784, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1739, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Quebeckers split up with ROC</b>\n\nThere was anotherstory going on between the Quebec artist-run center network and the Canadian artist-run center network.\n\nThe Quebec artist-run center network was created because the Canadian network didn't want to produce a directory of all artists-run centers.

We are going to test it this year where Nadia and Alberto currently live (200 sq m space).\n\nThe question we talked around was:\u00a0<strong>What is a good membership offer and one that is financially fair?</strong>\n\nSome models we went through:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>In Bali: people are willing to pay 500 USD a week and the big draw is coworking space and social connectivity</li>\n\n<li>In Cluj: Impact Hub memberships range from 60 to 150 eur, main target is startup scene</li>\n\n<li>In Yerevan: Impact Hub more expensive; focused on expats and the Armenian diaspora, but\u00a0missing out on the connection with the local realities</li>\n\n<li>SMART BE where LOTE5 was hosted in Bxl: they bought the space very cheap; their revenue (as far as we know) mostly comes from insurance companies they work with to support independent artists more than from the space itself</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nImportant distinctions:\n\nAll of the above are for profit businesses, unlike edgeryders..\u00a0\n\nBuying vs. Rental model: in the longer run we want to own our assets\n\nOne-off costs vs. Running costs: one-off costs are easy to crowdfund for in our network; we'd need to break the benefits into benefits for being a shareholder, in return for\u00a0helping create the space\u00a0and benefits in using the space, for contributing to the running costs.\n\nPersonal thoughts: obviously in between the high end market of the Impact Hub and other highly urban cowork models or small informal places ran by friends (we've seen mostly failing attempts everywhere) Edgeryders is positioned in between. We definitely need:\n\n1) people\u00a0paying with money in order to meet the\u00a0end of the month costs and run it sustainably, but also\n\n2) keep the door open for the severely underfunded people and projects who are aligned in vision, and who could pay in kind.\u00a0\n\nThe offer to these two types of \"participants\" are different imho. For the first - costs are covered by permanent residents + membership fees and services (! this is where the beef in the thinking is). For the second - costs are covered mostly on a shorter basis, more flexible and\u00a0in kind. But for the sake of sustainability the emphasis should fall on the first, at least in the short term.\u00a0\n\n@Maria and @Iriedawta I'm looking forward to read your impressions after the call. What should we not miss? What would your expectations from such a space be and what do you see yourselves\u00a0contributing in exchange, say\u00a0on a regular basis?

Edgeryders on Education, learning &amp; recognition</h3>Education is identified with the school system, formal education, as a process of obtaining credentials while learning is activity of an individual.\n\nLearning is generally associated with positive experiences and acquisition of useful knowledge and skills. Although much of this is gauged to happen either outside, in parallel to, or in spite of formal \u201cteaching\u201d and or educational environments, the need for some kind of learning foundation is recognised.\n\nWhile the perceptions about the experiences and kinds of knowledge acquired during formal education are mixed, there is general consensus that it neither sufficiently prepares young people for working life nor does it (with exceptions) provide them with skills, networks and other resources that will generate paid work. Teaching methods are criticised for not motivating students to discover their own interests or helping them to develop personal frames of enquiry (with the exception of art education). That said, several participants know and use theoretical approaches and thesis for explaining some facts taking place in their lives, such as staff behaviour in the work place, relations between employers and employees, violence (of any kind), manipulation and feelings.\n\nEdgeryders perceive that it is necessary to explore alternative paths to gaining skills and knowledge and have repeatedly raised the topic of recognition and acknowledgement of knowledge and skills acquired both within and outside formal educational environments. There is awareness within the European policy space of the need to promote and validate \"invisible\" skills. This is expressed in the current concern within the EU of evaluating skills and acquired in non-formal and informal settings. A perceived big challenge is to identify what kinds of skills are learned both within and outside formal educational settings (in Eu speak distinction is made between formal, non-formal and informal education) .\n\nThe attempt to gain acknowledgement and promotion for skills acquired in non-formal or informal education has been put in practice and coordinated at a national and European level through the European Qualifications Framework (EQF). EQF is based on recommendations and common principles developed in these areas gauged to be of \u201ckey\u201d competences for learners:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>quality assurance in higher education and in vocational education and training</li>\n\n<li>quality of mobility,</li>\n\n<li>validation of non-formal and informal learning, lifelong guidance</li>\n\n<li>the recognition of qualifications abroad</li>\n\n</ul><h3>2. Socialization, social relationships and learning</h3>The Edgeryders mission reports point to different, and possibly contradictory, roles played by socialization as par of the learning experience. On the one hand doubt is cast on whether or not socialisation is an actual part of purpose of university or possibly even part of the problem; some experiences from long-distance learning highlight the ability to pursue learning at one's own pace as a distinct advantage over synchronous teaching - teachers in classrooms are saddled with managing a balance between different students, and they end up tuning in to the average students, with the faster and slower ones suffering as a result.\u00a0 On the other hand one of the most important solutions to solve some recognised problems of educational/learning system is networking and building dense social relations.\n\nAndres Davila raised the point about the need to upgrade teaching methods in the classroom. In the same conversation it was pointed out by Gyula that classroom dynamics per se, rather than teaching methods, are a much bigger threat to some childrens learning trajectory due to discrimination and or bullying. In another conversation it was pointed out that distance-learning environments where there is correspondence (email/forums/phone) before physically meeting may offer young people opportunities to demystify power-relationships through socialisation with superior parties.\n\nPerhaps decoupling the different expectations of what education in general is supposed to offer can enable us to cope with new or increasing demand without putting more preassure on the same limited resources?\n\n<h3>3. New practices, new requirements, new demands</h3>In the 20th century we have seen increased access to primary, secondary and tertiary education in Europe. The effect of this is a consistent increase in the numbers of people with higher educational credentials - as well as prolonged periods of education, which in turn means a longer of transition period, ie. the period of \u201cyouth\u201d or \u201cnot yet adulthood\u201d is stretching far into people\u2019s 30s. This has been driven by:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>logic of the market: the need to adapt the workforce to changes in the labour market</li>\n\n<li>Different strands of ideology pulling in different directions:</li>\n\n</ol><ul>\n\n<li>classical functional vision: education is a sorting machine. It exists to effectively organise the training, selection, and allocation of individuals into set positions in society via different professional identities</li>\n\n<li>theory of human capital: more educated people = more effective economy</li>\n\n<li>discourse of equal opportunities and open access: equal access to education at all levels for larger number of people eliminates inequalities resulting from social origins. It is compatible with theory of human capital in that if everyone has educational credentials efficiency of the economy will be maximised and social awards will be distributed on the basis of professional and personal competence and not social characteristics</li>\n\n</ul>Consequences:\u00a0 education has held and still holds the promise of a good life; being better educated than your parents has implied that you could expect for a better life than the one they had. But since the 1980s the role of education has shifted from\u00a0 ticket to a better life to necessity without which you are excluded from the labour market. However, recent developments with regards to availability of student loans, reducing grants and increasing tuition fees are making it increasingly difficult for young people to continue or access higher studies. This is set against a background with record unemployment rates amongst young graduates who are frustrated because the promise of a good future for those who worked hard at school was not fullfilled.\n\nThe policy makers' perception of why we have unemployed graduates falls into two categories:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>the fault lies with the education system: it is not working well as sorting machine</li>\n\n<li>the fault lies with unemployed individuals: there is no probllm with the sorting machine, but individuals lack of competence makes them incompatible with the professional (social) structure and so they are out of it.</li>\n\n</ul>Education policy therefore\u00a0 aims to :\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>improve the efficiency of operation of the sorting machinery</li>\n\n<li>provide support for people, who \u201cdo not fit\u201d the market by providing them a proper type of training (again in the machine of preparation and sorting them).</li>\n\n</ol>Where much education policy thinking fails is that the underlying premise is false. There is no rigid occupational structure due to:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>prevalence of short term employment</li>\n\n<li>precarity/ uncertainty, escalated by a worldwide economic crisis and the fluctuations of the global economy, affecting all social layers</li>\n\n<li>variability of working conditions</li>\n\n<li>lack of transparency</li>\n\n</ul>The assumption that some social actor manages the above processes is also false.\n\nEducation as sorting has another problem. It fails to recognize that some young people don't necessarily want to follow in the path of the previos generations, but are considering new ways, and in fact new goals. Some of them are freedom, self-actualisation, satisfaction in work and personal lives - even though young people - at least from the vantage point of Edgeryders - don't know how to achieve them, or if it is even possible.\n\nIn learning environments, Edgeryders behave as they do elsewhere&gt; sharing knowledge, ideas, thoughts and experiences. This is in direct conflict with the rigid, hierarchical social structures which are an implicit and important element in political thinking about society in general and education in particular. Even though it has repeatedly been questioned (e.g. several thinkers have put forward that social structures are shaped by the rules and resources used by individuals in action), it is still there in the background and it is important to be aware of.\u00a0 Further it is reasonable that people who have power to create educational systems are imprinting it with their vision of the world. This means that educational systems are, almost by definition, conservative. The issues of democracy and the democratisation of societies are absent, as the assumption is that purpose of education is to maintain social stratification, not disrupt it. Expectations of any sort of change as fuelled by transformative capacity of education are misplaced.\n\n<h3>Recommendations</h3><ul>\n\n<li>innovation in administrative processes for evaluation of individuals and projects that better support fluid collaborations and more flexible approaches towards learning</li>\n\n<li>shift focus of programs financed by the European Commission from increasing value of indicators of participation in formal education to placing greater emphasis on changing culture of education/ students.</li>\n\n<li>encourage giving educational institutions more autonomy while promoting more exchange of experiences and what seems to be working well.</li>\n\n<li>open schools to society: networking and social capital support in order to build learning communities also with schools/universities as part of them. European policy should support regional programs and those in local communities in order to create spaces of continous improvement of skills and resilience of students social networks needed to successfuly navigate the real world. As well as\u00a0 emphasising the need for use of social media and other online resources by teachers and learners in education e.g. encouraging children to write blogs as studying method..</li>\n\n<li>use the Edgeryders project as a prototype of an successful online space and methodology for informal education. In addition to serving as a source of first hand knowledge about experiences of young people coming into maturity offering almost real time information about how policy is being perceived by and contributed to to by individual citizens, projects using the Edgeryders methodology offer:<ul>\n\n<li>opportunities to cross paths with people from a broad range of backgrounds to discuss relevant issues, develop critical thinking skills and develop personal frames of enquiry</li>\n\n<li>while creating new contacts and building new networks</li>\n\n<li>enhancing development of pre-existing, or gaining new, communication skills (including improving language skills)</li>\n\n<li>stimulating use of online resources and developing personal social media presence</li>\n\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n</ul>Piotr and Prudentia suggest that more space be made for this kind of initative in programmes financed by the European Union.\n\nDoes any of the above stick out for you?

Fabriquer et aimer/acheter sont deux processus identiques, deux processus de conception. D'un c\u00f4t\u00e9 on con\u00e7oit l'oeuvre \u00e0 venir, de l'autre on con\u00e7oit \"l'amour de l'oeuvre\". J'ai aussi \u00e9tudi\u00e9 les \u00e9crits de nombreux artistes dont C\u00e9zanne et Picasso.\n\nTous les artistes qui produisent \"abondamment\" utilisent un processus de conception. Tous ceux qui ont des difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 produire, \u00e0 sortir de la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition, refusent d'utiliser un processus de conception ou en utilisent un de mani\u00e8re non ad\u00e9quate. Depuis l'\u00e9poque romantique en Europe, il est d'usage pour de nombreux \"artistes\" de croire \u00e0 l'id\u00e9e magique ou \u00e0 l'effet de la folie comme moteur de la cr\u00e9ation.\n\nA chaque fois j'ai observ\u00e9 le m\u00eame processus mais appliqu\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re vari\u00e9e, pas sur les m\u00eames parties du monde et pas avec les m\u00eames moyens. De plus on va devoir distinguer si l'artiste se croie \u00e0 l'origine d'une sc\u00e8ne, dans une sc\u00e8ne qui fonctionne d\u00e9j\u00e0 ou \u00e0 la fronti\u00e8re d'une sc\u00e8ne. Ce positionnement influence la fa\u00e7on d'\u00e9valuer ce que doit \u00eatre l'aspect final de l'oeuvre.\n\nUne fois l'oeuvre con\u00e7ue, elle est l\u00e0 en attente de faire effet. Pour faire effet il faut des r\u00e9c\u00e9pteurs (voir mon mod\u00e8le du Canal de transfert des connaissances avec G. Beuchot\u00a0http://gerard.beuchot.free.fr/Recherche/Web_Transfert_de_connaissances/Canal_Transfert%20de%20connaissance.pdf\n\nIl faut que la nouveaut\u00e9 pr\u00e9suppos\u00e9e dans l'oeuvre d'art transforme des r\u00e9c\u00e9pteurs qui, par la suite, transformeront d'autres parties du monde.\n\nDe quoi est faite la nouveaut\u00e9 dans l'oeuvre d'art? Toutes les \u00e9tudes d'Esth\u00e9tique exp\u00e9rimentale montre qu'il existe deux sortes de nouveaut\u00e9. Une nouveaut\u00e9 ph\u00e9notypique --on repr\u00e9sente diff\u00e9remment et une nouveaut\u00e9 morphologique -- on construit difff\u00e9remment.\n\nLes grandes nouveaut\u00e9s m\u00e9langent les deux. Le moteur de ces nouveaut\u00e9s est toujours le m\u00eame, un algorithme de construction.\n\nLorsque cet algorithme de construction est pur et qu'il n'est jamais apparu, alors il se peut qu'on le trouve dans les cr\u00e9ateurs sauvages. La transformation r\u00e9sulte donc de la diffusion de cet algorithme de construction et de son application \u00e0 d'autres mati\u00e8res, d'autres domaines que son domaine initial.\n\nMais tout cela prend un certain temps, Lyne. La question prinicipale est: de savoir actuellement dans quels domaines \u00e9mergent ces nouveaux algorithmes purs (qu'ils soient sauvages ou artificiels) et s'il en existe, qu'est-ce qui freinent leur diffusion et leur utilisation dans d'autres domaines que le domaine initial.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-03-29 18:13:09", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:05.760254", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 491, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19957, "user_id": 2321, "topic_id": 3633, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>How to get a thousand children to code together </b>\n\n@Alberto we had the same thought!

They specialice in supporting social entrepreneurs, and have a long experience doing it. This is, apparently, good and bad. On the good side, they have resources and a very powerful network that, combined with the financial support they give to entrepreneurs (up to 3 years of salary to concentrate in his/her project), can have a very positive effect. They have also quite streamlined and stable processes for the selection of candidates.\n\nBut this could also be their weak point. In my case, it took very long till they considered our request. First we contacted them through the Mexico organization, through one of our allies that have done several projects with them. By the time they answered, almost 8 months later, we had already contacted the Spanish organization.\n\nThe Spanish Ashoka team took its time to react (I think they evaluate new proposals twice a year, which means a 3 months time delay). After providing quite a lot of information about the project and exchanging several e-mails, we had a Skype call with one of the responsibles. It was quite nice, and gave us the opportunity to explain many things. They showed interest. On the bad side, that several small details made us think that they had not been really reading (with proper care) the e-mails we sent them, nor the documentation. Probably they have a lot of candidates and need to optimise the time, but... well, it is not the best.\n\nAt the end of the call was the moment when they told us that they needed to see results, proof that the model was working, before considering supporting us. They had interest in the project, and were willing to stay in touch, but they considered it to be still \"too immature\".\n\nThis is ok. And is perfectly consistent with the procedures of Ashoka. This is the way they have been conducing their business for many years, quite successfully. But we have the impression that this can be too rigid to be able to capture web innovation, where the drivers of grow can get activated very quickly. If they wait to see success before they support... well, maybe they will be arriving too late, and their support is no longer needed. Or the alternative: a project that with their support would have been successful... will not reach that point.\n\nSo... our experience was good. But all the time we spent preparing documentation... would probably have been better used doing \"real work\".\n\nLesson: do not contact Ashoka till you have something very solid.\n\nRegards,\n\nPedro\n\n", "created_at": "2012-03-23 22:02:29", "updated_at": "2017-09-20 14:38:15.239117", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 526, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23214, "user_id": 81, "topic_id": 2375, "post_number": 10, "raw": "<b>In the meanwhile!</b>\n\nIn the meanwhile I uploaded your video on the <a href=\"https://timu.civiclinks.it/it/m/inquiry/racconta-chefare2/?s=42\">TIMU</a> platform since we had to start from somewhere :-)\u00a0\n\nAs soon as you send me the link I will change the link to the one with the Italian subtitles, so we won't have the moaners complain for the English accent!\u00a0\n\nThanks a ton!\n\n", "created_at": "2014-01-29 15:24:15", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:08.937504", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 80, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [23120], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10637, "user_id": 9, "topic_id": 4339, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Thanks, I've fixed!\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-04-27 16:03:20", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:01.065168", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 7, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [6515], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 538, "user_id": 514, "topic_id": 505, "post_number": 1, "raw": "There is a growing recognition about the negative effects stemming from commodifying innovation through restrictive I.P. protection and exclusivity, especially in the medical field. Open Source Development methodologies in software emerged as the dominant form of collaborative innovation in the late 90\u2019s and the trend has been spreading to a wider sphere of work. The IT infrastructure of today\u2019s world enables peers to connect, share and collaborate on solving common issues through use of collective knowledge. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons-based_peer_production\">Commons-based peer production</a> is the term that defines such collaborative efforts by peers. The collaborators act as the stewards of commonly held wealth and assets which could be anything ; monies, knowledge, equipment, reputations, social capital etc.The beauty of such networks is that development for one project can be mixed and remixed to suit a variety of other needs. Traditionally, such endeavors have been part of a gift-economy where peers do not seek tangible rewards for their contributions. However, for larger scale and mainstream economic model, gift economy is not a viable method for development. The question, then, is how do we keep track of contributions to inform fair rewards?\n\nThat is where the <a href=\"http://valuenetwork.referata.com/wiki/Main_Page\">Open Value Network</a> model (OVN) comes in. An OVN is built around a core open source community, preserving its nature, and adds layers of governance, infrastructure and methodologies in order to make large scale, open innovation networks as predictable and accountable as traditional organizations, such as coops or limited liability corporations. In an OVN, contributions to a process, be it tangible items such as time and money or intangibles such as social capital, are recorded and whatever benefit is derived from this process is proportionally divided and distributed back to contributors. This makes open networks sustainable, by allowing the implementation of capturing and redistribution mechanisms. Networks have yet to gain public recognition, legitimacy and legality, but the jury is out already, the OVN model makes open networks fully capable socioeconomic agents.\n\nSENSORICA is the first instantiation of the OVN model. It originated in Montreal, in early 2011. The initial focus of the network was to develop open source scientific research equipment using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons-based_peer_production\">commons-based peer production</a> methodologies. Indeed, most of activities are coordinated from the SENSORICA Montreal lab, a physical location where local affiliates can meet and work together. However, the Network Resource Planning (NRP) tools that Sensoricans have developed lays the foundation of a strong decentralized community without geographical borders. It allows tracking of the flow of resources through the entire system, at both micro and macro levels. NRP is the mainstay of all SENSORICA projects, and enables SENSORICA to practically implement the ideologies of collaborative and open innovation in a transparent and equitable manner.\n\nThe video bellow explains the idea in detail.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/Ixgp8_B9g5A\n\nThe wellness of societies and communities also depend on the innovation of its peers. Over the past few decades, the care aspect of communities has also been commodified. Healthcare and Education, the basics of human needs, have slowly been removed from the sphere of communities and instead, been handed over to closed and elitist institutions, including companies for profit-maximization. The result is a disjointed system where even these basic necessities are the purvey of the well-off. Moreover, in health care the quest for new cures and treatments is a quest for profits, and resources are mainly deployed in research and development (R&amp;D) that promises good returns on investments. The illnesses of a few are forgotten. Just like with technological innovation, we, as a society, need to free knowledge and break down barriers to participation. For that to happen, Open Science will play a big part, meeting the requirement of creating open source scientific equipment and research methodologies that enable peers to do R&amp;D on issues most important to them.\n\nSENSORICA's position on Open Science\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"389\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xT96IHM72W-RY0hMDGnHLzs9kDynm_NBuHLZO5z-jtg/embed?start=false&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.sensorica.co/home/working-space/activity-clusters/open-science\">See more on Open Science on SENSORICA's website</a>.\n\nGuy Rouleau, the director of <a href=\"https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/neuro-brain-research-patient-care-and-training\">McGill University\u2019s Montreal Neurological Institute</a> (MNI) announced recently <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/01/montreal-institute-going-open-accel-erate-science\">in the Science Magazine</a> that his institute was going to steer towards Open Science.\n\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><i>\u201cWe think that it is a way to accelerate discovery and the application of neuroscience.\u201d (\u2026) \u201cThere is a fair amount of patenting by people at the institute, but the outcomes have not been very useful\u201d (...) \u201cIt comes down to what is the reason for our existence? It\u2019s to accelerate science, not to make money.\u201d</i></blockquote>\n\nSENSORICA has already taken concrete steps towards implementing this vision. One of the first projects undertaken by Sensoricans was the <a href=\"http://www.sensorica.co/home/what-we-do/projects/mosquito\">Mosquito</a>, a force-transducer with ability to detect micron-scale movements, designed for applications in biomechanics at the cellular level. Today, SENSORICA has over 15 projects for open source scientific instruments in different stages of development, some of them being used in University labs (<a href=\"http://www.sensorica.co/home/what-we-do/projects#TOC-Scientific-Instruments\">see the full list</a>). However, the main potential lies in the ability of the community to build upon these and many other devices and repurpose them to fit needs in diverse fields.\n\n<a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ztWSM2D2eag/V942fubuoUI/AAAAAAAAPgA/W0Mq5fEJPq4KqiAAYQS3D_G4FupU-jSSwCLcB/s1600/Modern%2BMosquito%2Bsetup%2B2.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ztWSM2D2eag/V942fubuoUI/AAAAAAAAPgA/W0Mq5fEJPq4KqiAAYQS3D_G4FupU-jSSwCLcB/s640/Modern%2BMosquito%2Bsetup%2B2.jpg\"></a>\n\nSENSORICA's Mosquito system - by photo <a href=\"https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/user.html?id=1554342033592517832346042&amp;nav=models\">Daniel Brastaviceanu</a>\n\nOpen source scientific instruments cost only of a small fraction to produce and to maintain, compared to their proprietary equivalents. This reduces the costs of innovation and widens participation in research. Professor <a href=\"https://www.mtu.edu/materials/department/faculty/pearce/\">Joshua Pearce</a> from Michigan Tech University, and contributor to the SENSORICA OVN mentions in <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzrQyEif2HItRDZMZTVRSVdURTQ/view\">one of his papers</a>:\n\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><i>A case study of a syringe pump with numerous scientific and medical applications is presented. The results found millions of dollars of economic value from a relatively simple scientific device being released under open-licenses representing orders of magnitude in-crease in value from conventional proprietary development. The inescapable conclusion of this study is that FOSH development should be funded by organizations interested in maximizing re-turn on public investments particularly in technologies associated with science, medicine and education.</i></blockquote>\n\nDuring its six years in development, SENSORICA has prototyped formal relations with Universities and medical centers, demonstrating how the crowd and the institutional academia can successfully interface, opening wide and filtering participation in medical research, allowing discovery to go towards what matters to people, not just to Wall Street. The <a href=\"http://www.sensorica.co/home/what-we-do/projects/mosquito\">Mosquito</a> sensor has been developed in collaboration with the <a href=\"https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjcv5X1pZjPAhVDzIMKHZESARUQFggdMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.icm-mhi.org%2Fen%2Fmontreal-heart-institute&amp;usg=AFQjCNGReL3utL83kpovwsIaGdg2wQkwjw&amp;sig2=P-9daXRSpWedmNhGCwKNGw&amp;bvm=bv.133178914,d.amc\">Montreal Heart Institute</a> and <a href=\"http://www.polymtl.ca/en\">Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.sensorica.co/home/what-we-do/projects/touch-sensitive-robots-for-micro-manipulation/xyz-piezo-micromanipulator\">Manipulators</a> have been developed in partnership with <a href=\"https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjksvXspZjPAhXn5IMKHVFIApQQFggfMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcgill.ca%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNHK32kxsQ3xIsVbQ36CBPRkvMOWZw&amp;sig2=PAFCZDhRW81O0To-pO5iSg\">McGill University</a>.

See SENSORICA\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.sensorica.co/home/working-space/interns\">Interns webpage</a>.\n\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><span>--&gt; Lower cost open source scientific instruments lower the barrier to entry to medical research.\n\n--&gt; Interfacing institutional academia with open networks frees research topics from the narrow profit motive and speeds up innovation</span></blockquote>\n\nIn early 2015, SENSORICA partnered with <a href=\"http://breathinggames.net/?q=en\">Breathing Games</a> to produce an <a href=\"http://www.sensorica.co/home/what-we-do/projects/breathing-games\">open source therapeutic device</a> for kids suffering from cystic fibrosis. But this project is very different. As we are designing the hardware device, we are also thinking about how the data generated from its use during therapy sessions will be managed. It turns out that the blockchain technology can truly revolutionize how therapy and medical care are administered, and how the medical data is managed, and SENSORICA has already embarked in blockchain applications development.\n\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><span>--&gt; blockchain and other p2p technologies create the possibility of new health care services</span></blockquote>\n\nThe vision for SENSORICA is to demonstrate the economic viability and practical superiority of open innovation. Since innovation has been segregated from community for the better part of the last century, the possibilities of applications are endless. We are not claiming to have the solution all the problems that our health care system is facing, but our past experiences have allowed us to peer into a new realm of solutions, enabled by the new digital technology and the new socioeconomic processes it has made possible.\n\nThere is a lot of criticism for commons-based peer processes pertaining to their ability to deliver large scale solutions, while being self-sustainable. In other words, the conclusions point to the persistent need of traditional forms of organizing innovation, production and distribution, in order to fuel these new processes: <i>one needs to have a paid job to contribute to open source development</i>. The flaw in these arguments is that they analyse these new practices within the traditional capitalist paradigm. Commons-based peer processes are part of a new socioeconomic paradigm, which prescribes its own underlying theory of value and its own capturing and redistribution mechanisms. Saying that open innovation is unsustainable is factually false, even within the capitalist regime. <a href=\"https://www.arduino.cc/\">Arduino</a>, for example, is a very successful commercial operation relying entirely on open source hardware and software technology. Most successful 3D printing and personal drone commercial operations also rely on open source, as well as operations that provide blockchain applications. All these new and disruptive technologies are dominated by these new types of ventures who know how to steward open networks. Something is going on here, for those who have eyes to see. And all these organizations are only hybrids, in the sense that their structure have capturing mechanisms that function in a market-driven economy, while relying on commons-based peer processes for innovation. SENSORICA has data that shows, perhaps for the first time, how capturing mechanisms that are fully compatible with the logic of the p2p economy can be gradually introduced within this transitory economy, to become dominant in a very near future.\n\nWe do not have experience in pharmaceuticals. We cannot prescribe today a method through commons-based peer production to deliver a new drug, going through all the norms and regulations. The monetary costs associated with this type of ventures are huge, and if we transpose the challenge in an OVN setting it would require the deployment of an amount of resources and a complexity that we cannot sustain, at this point in time. But we do not see a hard barrier... As these systems scale, one day they will be capable of undertaking such challenges. Alternatively, we do have extensive experience with scientific instruments and less costly, and less regulated therapeutic devices. This is the path of least resistance for OVNs to infiltrate the care domain and gain strength. Joshua Pearce's conclusions show that once open source-based scientific instruments enter a market niche it totally disrupts it, putting traditional companies out of business, as they cannot sustain their operations at such low product prices. Operating at lower prices, the monetary rewards an organization gets for the product, doesn't mean that we are going towards poverty. The zero marginal cost tendency, driven by open innovation, only makes sense in the capitalist paradigm. These new organizations pull other benefits from non-market-based sources, which are forbidden to traditional for-profit enterprises. We need a different type of accounting in order to determine the wealth of network-type organizations, one that goes beyond monetary currency, because innovation, production and rewards are more and more driven and organized by new types of currencies, by new types of symbolic systems, by <i>current-sees</i> [a concept proposed by <a href=\"https://medium.com/@artbrock\" target=\"_blank\">Arth Brook</a>].\n\nWritten by <a href=\"http://www.sensorica.co/home/about-us/abran-khalid\">Abran Khalid</a> and <a href=\"http://www.sensorica.co/home/about-us/tiberius-brastaviceanu\">Tiberius Brastaviceanu</a>\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe text has been remixed from a post for a book made by Tibi.

No, I'm not interested to put labels on people. Rather to learn what motivates each single person to do and like the things they do ... and that's really interesting, as everybody is so different.\n\nAbout sacred and secular: is that even a difference? I always expect that, should I ever get the \"full\" understanding of reality that I will of course never achieve, it will imply the realization that I live in <em>one</em> reality. Neither sacred nor secular, it's all part of one world. And \"one world\" means, no mutually contradicting spaces of knowledge. That's why I am so insisting about distinguishing facts and form in religious behavior: in order to finally find how, for example, natural sciences and theologic facts are just two parts of the same reality ... still struggling with it, and a long way to go, but you may call me a believer if you like ;-)\n\nAbout Arthur's remarks on what fits the 'ethos' of Edgeryders: I understand and share the worries, and would frame it like this: when including an actual pagan ritual, or in fact any ritual of a fixed belief system, it's hard to keep up the impression that this\u00a0space is welcoming <em>everyone</em>, to explore, share and discourse about all kinds of stuff while feeling comfortable. The more closed impression with rituals, even if not intended, seems to come in with the power of imagery and ritualized behavior, which have considerable psychological power and alsofor bystanders, carry the notion of \"a mystery, for the initiated\". A ritual is also different from a discourse about a ritual, which I'm comfortable and interested to have here (like now in fact). In a discourse I'm always welcome to contribute my perspective (even if that's \"Let's dissect rituals with science\" :D ), while in the actual ritual I'm not ...\n\nHowever, it's not just as simple. Given that rituals, symbols and imagery are all powerful, it's of course interesting to experiment with that, and to use them for expressing content (like \"celebrating\" something). How to do that here and keep being a welcoming place for everyone? It's my impression that the key is inventing your own imagery and rituals rather than taking over existing ones or merging them into existing belief systems. It communicates \"Hey, we made all this up, there's no deeper meaning. We're just interested in the social effects.\" unMonastery itself would be an example, and seemingly also Bembo's \"Listening to the Ancestors\" walk (minus the candles maybe :D ), and parts of Sunday Assemblies. (And for context, that's why I asked about a \"fully secularized\" version before.)\n\nDoes the above make sense? (I'm just gathering my thoughts on this on the go ... never thought about this before.)\n\n", "created_at": "2013-10-23 23:53:41", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:11.301484", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 493, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [11475], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7521, "user_id": 81, "topic_id": 5379, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Thumbs up!</b>\n\nI am still overcoming the wave of hatred that was generated by my participation at the \\#LOTE5 event, and this news is a step forward in that sense.

They are watching, before others, what's going on in the area of medication. They mention discontinuities in supply, lack of money from some people, and a certain amount of fear.\n\nI've used that opportunity to mention tougher scenarios. What's going on in Greece. What we did at \\#LOTE. What we might be able to do locally. How we're at least circling around the problems, and how there are some hints at solutions.\n\nPeople don't like looking at hard possibilities. Then they accept that you have the electric grid and you also keep candles and matches somewhere in your kitchen. I'm still trying to go deeper in the conversations around the 35 (or 70, or whatever the number is) essential medications, and how many might be manufactured distributedly, either as part of the normal way to do things, or in a crisis.\n\nYou (Lyne) and I have been flubies. That means we've looked at influenza pandemics for some time. Other people have looked at other specific threats (peak oil, climate change, poverty and others were mentioned), and most people have vaguely looked at many threats.\n\nFor me, it was a small revelation to have to write a short definition of resilience for this summary, one that included all threats. So resilience, as came out of our conversation, is about \"sudden shock _or prolongued pressure_\". Timing matters a lot! This economic meltdown situation is going slower than I thought (my timing model was wrong). That's good because there's time to adjust. But it also has a \"boiled frog\" component, and a \"fatigue\" component.\n\nYou mention vitamins and other \"non essentials\". I'm quite sure there's lots of hidden slack in the system, at least in rich (or formerly rich) countries. People know things, and have tools. How much in the beauty industry (or in the chewing gum industry, etc) could be repurposed for pharmaceuticals? What's the map of interdependencies between raw products (herbs or wherever it is that they get the molecules from), machinery, know-how, quality control, etc? This is the kind of things that's best asked before a sudden crisis, or at the initial stages of a prolongued one.\n\nSome things are not easy. Where I live, 7000 people (in 2 million) are insulin-dependent diabetics, meaning exercise, diet and oral medication is not enough. Most of them are young-ish. In a sudden, deep shock, many people are surely at risk. So a question was asked about insulin, and this is one answer we got: http://www.indiebiotech.com/?p=135 But of course we need to ask other people, and that's where networks come in.\n\nThis too was a revelation for me. Maybe there's need to ask several different people. Map out the problem, have the network grow out of partial contributions. A bit of a mix between the \"you are here\" train-network maps, and the \"push here\" of emergency buttons. Facilitate contributions to complex problems. (In a rush, or when people don't feel the pressure.) Extremely intriguing, not to mention possibly quite useful!\n\nI'm still recovering from \\#LOTE. But one of this days - unless someone else beats me to it (wink, wink) - I'd like to look into the list of essential medications. Maybe there could be a way to estimate how much is needed of each one, for which ones there are already generics, etc. This is needed worldwide, given that many people live on less than 2-3 dollars a day, right?\n\nThere's still a lot to do, and we have some questions.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-26 23:20:19", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:03.253111", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 642, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 15.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11027, "user_id": 54, "topic_id": 1508, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Ciao Alberto!</b>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<div>Hi Alberto,\u00a0</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>I'll try to briefly explain one example of an YOUNG who benefits from turning towards VILLAGE!\u00a0</div><div>I have a close friend who succeeded accessing an EU's found with which he set up a CATTLE FARM for milk production, and what its super interesting is the fact that this young entrepreneur (highly educated in Business Management) went one step forward in order to WIN the battle with supermarkets by transporting the milk (pasteurized) directly to clients' house (the majority from the closest city) for a more then reasonable price (To mention that that he doesn\u2019t have STOCKAGE COSTS given that he sells all production).

So far, so Unix. :D\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nCopyright protection only goes so far with hardware. It's really specific to the design docs, and not the objects made using the design docs. You could restrict the distribution of the made objects without a design docs distribution, by having copyright licenses to the design docs using clauses that would mean if they didn't distribute the docs, then they'd be guilty of copyright infringement, as they'd be using the original docs without a valid license.\n\nIt won't stop anyone from reverse-engineering the made objects, or just copying the designs and using them without attribution, but it's another speed-bump for bad actors, and another carrot for good actors.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nPatents are a whole 'nother issue. Each patent contains specific claims that will detail how something is done, but it will only cover the method that is explicitly laid out in those claims. It doesn't cover any work-arounds, or alternative methods for doing the thing that is specified in the patent.\n\nThey are also country-specific, so you'll need to file a patent application in every country at once. Is why most companies try for the USA patent system, as they're vastly under-funded, under-staffed, and the resulting patent will cover a wide geographic area, that is in theory one unified market.\n\nImproving the market disparity between the EU and the USA, is one of the strands of thought that is behind the recent (ie. last 15 years.) attempts to harmonise all of the separate patent systems that you find in the different countries in the EU. Though as you might guess, there are already bad actors trying to game the system, even as they're building it.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe other thing about patents is that they only give the right to sue, nothing else. Yes, you can get injunctions that will bar the importation of the physical objects, and, yes, the courts are willing to serve those, but you have to be able to afford to go to the courts in the first place. The patent courts are a rich person's game.\n\nAnd time that is spent suing people is time that you aren't using to make the next iteration...\n\nDon't get me wrong, i like the level of disclosure that is involved in the patent system, and the relative level of protection that they provide. A paper shield is better than none, but it requires a large wallet to make any meaningful attempt to enforce the patent.\n\nYou also get the problem that sometimes the big cartels will shut a patent-holder out of the market, untill the patent only has a few years left to run, and then give a take-it-or-we'll-wait-till-it-expires offer to the patent-holder.\n\nAnd yes, that sort of market-manipulation IS illegal, but for some reason it doesn't get prosecuted very often, if at all...\n\nA nice example of this, was the invention of the recordable digital disc. Invented and patented in 1964, but only released to the market around the early '80's, approximately 2 years before the expiry date..\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnd you've already seen where i'm eventually heading. Boot-strappable CNC systems, that you can make the initial versions with hand tools and hand power-tools, that you can use to upgrade themselves to full functionality. (And yes this was partly inspired by the GCC story, partially by the Reprap project, and partially by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_J._Gingery\">David Gingery</a>.)\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nThe legal protection that i'm looking for will be ignored by bad actors, who'll just take the design docs and use them, while ignoring the licences. Have you tried to sell technology to China recently? They'll only buy what they can't copy or reverse-engineer, and that's even before you start to talk about the intermittent enforcement of the Berne Convention by the Chinese courts.\n\nBy using only technology from expired patents, you sidestep almost all of the boobytraps that are a direct result of the patent systems, and you are guaranteed to get the design's that have been thoroughly de-bugged. Very important when you are designing safety-critical systems, and all forms of infrastructure are safety-critical systems.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nI've been researching the use of the EU Registered Design and the licencing and sub-licencing of those designs.

But it's just a suspect and I won't dig more on this issue.\n\nGoing back to my experience\u2026\n\n<strong>20 years at school didn't teach me how to:</strong>\n\nLook for the meaning in what I'm doing. \"Don't ask why and do your homework.\" or \"One day you'll understand\" kind of message was the norm during math lessons.\n\nWe never explicitily and consistently talked about \"aims\" in my school.\n\n<strong>Where and how I learnt it:</strong>\n\nI guess practicing experimental theatre for one year full-time taught me nothing was for granted and everything had to be designed or thought at least.

In Italian we don't even have an appropriate translation for the word networking. Isn't networking the most important skill in the work environment?\n\n<strong>20 years at school didn't teach me how to:</strong>\n\nco-create with others\n\nBecause they have to give me a grade, my grade, they never encouraged me to copy and build on top on my peers work.\n\n<strong>Where and how I learnt it:</strong>\n\nin the virtual world while learning to code and on Wikipedia as well.\n\nWith online videogames. I've been playing online videogames for years. There I learnt how to coordinate my efforts with strangers all over the world.\n\n<strong>20 years at school didn't teach me how to:</strong>\n\ntake initiative and risks, explore the real world, see failures as occasions to learn\u2026\n\nThis is really the most important block of skills for me and maybe the synthesis of all the previouses.\n\n<strong>Where and how I learnt it:</strong>\n\nOrganizing workshops and events inside a local and then european student association taught me the joy of taking initiative: to make things happen and to make things.\n\nWith these activities I learnt to generously take initiative just for the fun of it: with no expected clear direct benefit.\n\nI could keep writing about personal finance, time management, english language, questioning the authority, cooking\u2026 but I don't wanna write a monologue! :)\n\n\u00a0\n\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.917969); \">What's your experience regarding these skills and activities?

The public is not likely to be outraged by seeing that there are potholes in Tbilisi, but people being killed on the streets is another matter.\n\nYou mentioned that a core issue is simply raising people's awareness that their rights to safety and public space are being trampled on. While a map may not influence with the council to make changes, it can tell a very clear story to the public. That this is a big, important, life-threatening issue, and injuries/deaths are happening on a larger scale than you perhaps notice in your day-to-day life.\n\nWhen you can show that you have public support, your options with the council will be much greater than they are now.</span>\n\n<span>The only crowdsourced pedestrian map I can think of is the one put together by a public radio station in Los Angeles, comparing the intersections which the council regards as dangerous with the submissions of the pedestrian and cycling public: <a href=\"http://projects.scpr.org/static/maps/pedestrian-safety/\">http://projects.scpr.org/static/maps/pedestrian-safety/ </a></span>\n\n<span><span>Crowdsourced mapping is where I saw the potential for a collaboration with<span> Elva</span> or <span>Jumpstart,</span> but crowdsourced or not, these kinds of maps have been used to great effect to tell a powerful story</span> - here for example is a thorough infographic from the New York Times last week, which accompanies an article with human stories of the victims of accidents: <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/05/04/nyregion/where-pedestrians-and-bicyclists-are-injured-and-why.html\">http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/05/04/nyregion/where-pedestrians-and-bicyclists-are-injured-and-why.html</a></span>\n\n<span>One of the direct action pedestrian rights groups in New York, Right of Way, has actually done exactly what I was thinking of with a stencilling campaign, to draw attention to accidents in the place they happen - in fact, there are plenty of relevant ideas you can borrow from them. <a href=\"http://www.rightofway.org/campaigns\">http://www.rightofway.org/campaigns</a></span>\n\noh, and to tag somebody in a comment, just write an 'at' sign and start typing the first couple of letters of somebody's name - once you've typed e...r... you'll see <a href=\"/user/5634\">@ericnbarrett</a> listed as one of the options in the space below the comment form.

It can include: statements, conversations, actions (i.e. the digital component of actions).\n\n<strong>Digital environment</strong>: the OpenCare digital space where online events (as, conversations and actions) take place. Depending on its embedded affordances, these events can be, in different ways, supported, oriented or hindered.\n\n<strong>Conversation</strong>: a sequence of interactions taking place in the OpenCare digital environment. It is related to a given <em>matter of concern</em>. Its interactions are asynchrony and done in a written form. Therefore they are traceable.\n\n<strong>Action:</strong> a <em>coordinated</em> sequence of interactions aiming at <em>changing the state of things</em> inside and/or outside the digital environment. In our research we <em>directly</em> consider and evaluate the ones happening inside the digital environment. But we are interested to register also the one happening outside it, which can be:\n\n- results of conversations happening inside the OpenCare digital environment\n\n- triggers of new conversations happening inside the OpenCare digital environment\n\n<strong>(here there should be the \"Emerging types of </strong><strong>evetns</strong><strong>\" matrix - but the system doesn't \u00a0</strong><strong>up-load</strong><strong> it)</strong>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<strong>NB.</strong> This matrix has been upgraded, keeping in account the discussion done in the Geneva meeting\n\n<strong>Event nature</strong>: the inherent features, character, or qualities of an event.

Opinions exchanging</strong>: expressions of care-related ideas, opinions, feelings\n\n<strong>b. Information sharing</strong>: exchange of care-related information and experiences potentially useful for care-related actions.\n\n<strong>c.

It depends on the way that digital space has been infrastructured.\n\n<strong>Infrastructure</strong>: a large scale socio-material assembly that affords local practices, in our case, conversations and actions. Each infrastructure has two components: \u00a0the operational (physical) infrastructure, and the relational (socio-cultural) one.\n\n<strong>Infrastructuring</strong>: the action of improving large scale socio-material assembly giving it more effective affordances. Infrastructuring requires long term commitment and results from different kinds of design initiatives: operational infrastructure must be directly design and realized, the relational one emerge from adding up the effects of several local practices ( in our case conversations and actions).\n\n<strong>References:</strong>\n\n<strong>* Language-action perspective </strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Winograd\">Terry Winograd</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Flores\">Fernando Flores</a> <em>Understanding Computers and Cognition: A New Foundation for Design</em> (Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley 1987)</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=dp_byline_sr_book_1?ie=UTF8&amp;text=Fernando+Flores&amp;search-alias=books&amp;field-author=Fernando+Flores&amp;sort=relevancerank\">Fernando Flores</a> (Author), <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=dp_byline_sr_book_2?ie=UTF8&amp;text=Maria++Flores+Letelier&amp;search-alias=books&amp;field-author=Maria++Flores+Letelier&amp;sort=relevancerank\">Maria Flores Letelier</a> (Editor) <em>Conversations For Action and Collected Essays: Instilling a Culture of Commitment in Working Relationships</em> (<a href=\"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/%22CreateSpace%20Publishing%22?Ntk=Publisher&amp;Ns=P_Sales_Rank&amp;Ntx=mode+matchall\">CreateSpace Publishing</a>, 2012) -<a href=\"http://conversationsforaction.com/the-book\">http://conversationsforaction.com/the-book</a></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>** Actor-network theory</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Bruno Latour and Peter Weibel <em>Making things public: atmospheres of democracy</em>.

We went there after receiving call from <a href=\"/u/ritao\">@RitaO</a> with news that at 9:15AM someone will go there to pick up some chairs and this way we can get in and loo for wireless bridge antennas, which we planned to donate to local Ninux mesh. When we arrived we also had an opportunity to exchange greetings with couple of good old Comitato MT2019 folks :)\n\nTo cut the long story short, the building got robbed recently including mesh network antennas which we tried to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ninuxorg/posts/887549101269900?comment_id=889032827788194&amp;offset=0&amp;total_comments=1\">pass to Ninux already for last couple of weeks</a> :( Also <a href=\"https://trello.com/b/Z0UmZkEj/furniture-objects\">various equipment acquired by Edgeryders/unMonastery</a> vanished in this incident, IMO we could have stored it in more secure location (<strong>#TODO</strong> add to <a href=\"/t/il-libro-degli-errori/573\">unMonastery - The Book of Mistakes</a>). On top of that, electric wires with copper, heating system boilers and rack with network equipment got pulled out of the walls. I won't dedicate any more time to that incident, especially that very likely <a href=\"/u/alberto\">@Alberto</a> (sitting ATM right next to us) will follow up on that in more depth!\n\nOn much more positive side, in the evening we joined nice get together + buffet of MT2019 gang at Palazzo Lanfranchi. We could enjoy there again few short conversations with Rita, @ilariadauria, @rossellatarantino, Raffaella, Emmanuele and few other friends present :D\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Open Lab Matera</h3>\n\nIn last two days we stayed most of the time at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/OpenLabMatera\">Open Lab Matera</a>. Working together, sharing lunch, chatting. We very much enjoyed warm atmosphere there, especially our unMonastic bro <a href=\"/u/marc\">@Marc</a>!

Individual trajectories are turned into \u201cin common\u201d city explorations\u201d. </strong>\n\nThe young participants of the <strong>Athens Travelers </strong>program transfer their knowledge/practice to their co-peers and work together to create a number of alternative guided city tours.\n\nIn the current economic circumstances in which despair reigns supreme and the youth faces social exclusion and the fast raising unemployment rate, the <strong>Athens Travelers </strong>program creates an opening for the youths\u2019 innovative force; it aims to bring together young people from different educational, social and cultural backgrounds and the young with fewer opportunities (the young unemployed, immigrants, with special skills, ex-delinquents or ex-addicts, etc) to nourish mutual understanding, support and cooperation.\n\nIf the 19th century travelers were after the Athenian past, the travelers of this program seek to understand the effects of a city tormented by social unrest and economic instability. That which appears monstrous in today\u2019s Athens might be just the announcement of a future we haven\u2019t thought of. The program asks the city\u2019s youth to choose specific city itineraries and present city features conceived as problematic, that is, as that which holds the potential to reframe.\n\n\u00a0The young people to whom this program is addressed are:\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0Insiders: the \u2018From within\u2019 city connoisseurs\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0\u0399n-sight-seers: who see the \u2018would-be\u2019 in the place of despair and in the state of deadlock\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0Inciters: who stimulate a reassembling of humans, buildings/unbuilt spaces and nature\n\nThis program is a carefully planned type of the so called \u2018non formal\u2019 learning and it is designed to have multiple results and added value. The <strong>Athens Travelers </strong>program will provide not only a productive outlet for the young but it may create an alternative source of income in the long run.\n\nThe program is running since March. After a first open call 5 itineraries where proposed and developed in collaboration with the SARCHA team and a program of experimental guided tours open to the general public was implemented.\n\nThe itineraries so far are the following:\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0Migrants\u2019\u00a0 destiny \u2013 destination: Greek migrants itineraries in the postwar Athens\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0Degrees of Appropriation: Open City Spaces\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0Who\u2019s Who in the National Garden\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0From one Hill to Another: Everyday Obstacles for Cyclists\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0AfterTaste:\u00a0Food Itineraries\n\nThis first phase of the program proved to be very successful and we are trying to design the next phase with more itineraries and more guided tours.\n\nFor more information you can visit\n\nour web page <a href=\"http://www.athenstravelers.sarcha.gr/\">www.athenstravelers.sarcha.gr</a>\n\nour facebook page <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/athenstravelers.sarcha.gr\">http://www.facebook.com/athenstravelers.sarcha.gr</a>\n\nor you can follow us at Twitter @athenstravelers\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-07 12:26:54", "updated_at": "2017-09-13 10:09:44.577683", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 537, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28993, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5138, "post_number": 19, "raw": "<b>Works</b>\n\nOk, I reiterated my offer on your spreadsheet.

I consider myself privileged to be born into a comfortable middle class life, to have a supportive family and friends, no academic problems. In theory, I was supposed to be happy. So why was I feeling so paralysed and helpless? Considering there are so many people who have it much worse than me, feeling sad seemed irrational, unjustified and shameful.\n\nEveryone around me seemed to manage just fine, effortlessly juggling scholastic and social expectations. So I thought it must be my fault that I was barely holding it together. I was ashamed to admit that I was struggling and ask for help. When I finally gathered enough courage to talk openly about my problems with my friends and family members, I was stunned how much it resonated. Once I had shared my troubles, many of them would admit some of their own. These were people that I had known for more than 10 years, people that I thought I knew inside out, suddenly telling me about insecurities of theirs that I never even suspected them to have. Such moments of connection were a very special experience.\n\nHowever, at times it was also exhilarating. It's not easy for either party.\u00a0Opening up, even to the people I trust most,\u00a0took a great deal of mental effort. Then, I didn\u2019t know how to properly express what I felt. And they didn\u2019t know how to react. I didn\u2019t know what kind of reaction I was hoping for. I didn\u2019t want to burden or worry anyone. How often did I find myself alone in my room bawling my eyes out, finally calling my mother or my best friend, just to hang up 5 minutes later even more frustrated and miserable and guilty than before. They were only trying to help me to the best of their abilities, but somehow all well-meant compliments and advice only made me feel worse. I didn\u2019t think they could truly understand me and it was so difficult to communicate what I wanted to say, when I didn't even\u00a0really know what that was myself. When they tried to relate their own experiences to mine, it felt like they were comparing a broken arm to a papercut. When they were trying to give me tips on health and well-being, it felt patronizing, as if I didn\u2019t know and try that already. This was nothing that doing a round of Yoga or 8 hours of sleep or being more social could simply \u2018fix\u2019. Just thinking such things added to my guilt and shame, because it was like I was taking their attempts of help for granted. Devils circle.\n\nWhat helped me most in the end wasn\u2019t necessarily talking about anything in those situations. Discussing these things with a neutral person such as a therapist was a much better framework for me to sort out my thoughts without the added complications of emotional attachment. The greatest help for me was just someone being there and giving me a hug. Telling me that they know it sucks and just sharing a little bit of the suckiness in that moment.\n\nEDIT:\n\nHow do\u00a0you deal\u00a0with emotional issues? In what situations do you share\u00a0your thoughts with others? How does this make you feel? What might prevent you from seeking support?\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-05-08 22:52:37", "updated_at": "2018-05-26 04:02:39.777428", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 615, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 30.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16876, "user_id": 10, "topic_id": 1621, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Youth Diplomacy</b>\n\nHi Constanze!\n\nglad to have finally found your post :) Veru interesting btw.\n\nStill I have some questions/clarifications to make.\n\nYou started witht th argument that the citiyens of the EU memebr states are becoeming more and more skeptical and even critical about this supra-national instittution.\u00a0 Rather that having a debate here about the pro and cons of the EU, I think it is fair to acknowledge that it has some deep structual and functional flaws and that perhaps some of the criticism and grievances are indeed justified and should be voiced out and listened to in a open and democratic manner.\n\n<strong>Now about the EU Ambassadors initiative. </strong>\n\nI personally don't feel that my views and opinions are represented by either the Moldovan or Romanian UN Youth Representative (even though I know one of them personally). I think it's a nice opportunity for them as envoys to learn and expand their network, but not necessarily about the youth in their countries. A lot of young people even the ones passionate about politics and IR are not aware of this position. Often the selction is not really transparent either. There is virtually no communication and interaction between them. Maybe you know a more optimistic story from your country. Also it is very hard for a single person to astablish some kind of connection directly wit hte citizenry. Some international organizations have whole divisions designed for this task and they still don't manage to do it well.\n\nHow about the Ombudsman? Isn't he a sort of 'less formal diplomat', 'a people's advocate'?\n\nWhy 54 people (2 people x 27 MS)? How about the candidate countries? How about the neigbouring countries that are trying to meet Eu standards for accession?\n\n<strong>Back to skepticism.</strong>\n\nEven I, that have studies International Relations and European Studies for my Bachelor, am VERY critical about the EU. If one desires to get informed about the European intitutions there are tons of 'propaganda' material to be easily found on the internet and even in the public libraries, etc.\n\nI think that a big part of the disapointment with the EU come from direct negative experiences related to it. Be it accessing strucutral funds, or change in policies, or changes directly conncted wit hthe change of currency (national to Euro), democartic and transparency deficit, etc, etc.\n\nI think what we nned more thse days is open public discussions on these issues.

Many of my efforts recently have been along the lines of building communication networks that amplify the real knowledge of a community. This is helpful info. Was reading about the Nepal work recently. Respect!\n\nIn an art context,\u00a0 I\u2019ve favoured systems that use cheap speakers &amp; computing platforms - https://github.com/BelaPlatform/Bela/wiki/What-is-Bela%3F The ritualistic attempt to voice what has not been voiced feels suited to something more public like a sculpture\u00a0- eg. recent attempt with\u00a0small bird sculpture in Liverpool that had speakers inside it <a href=\"http://byzantium.chroma.space/about/\">http://byzantium.chroma.space/about/</a>\n\nBut you\u2019re right that when it comes to spreading info &amp; learning material, personal listening as you work is the way (&amp; listening also cuts out the problem of not being able to study in the dark.) The mp3 system feels like it has really great potentials for education - and also distributing more taboo info like facts about AIDS and addiction treatment programmes.\u00a0\n\n@trythis I will pass this on to Ngala and some NGOs working with addiction &amp; will be in contact if there's interest.\n\nOne question - why not distribute cheap phones rather than mp3 players? Is it battery considerations? Phones seem to be altogether more useful and could simplify the problem of how to get the audio back?\n\nOn the subject of making the content accessible but also inspiring &amp; interactive I think there's interesting creative questions. It\u2019s pretty clear that \u201ddigging into a niche\u201d is going to be more effective as a distribution method (though realise this has to be proved if you\u2019re doing an academic study.) When it comes to replicating the \u201chuman touch\u201d that Ngala gave to his work through his supportive presence, it feels like powerful design of the audio experience can hold that sense of the encouragement and support of another person. Interested how you meet that creative design question? ie. recording compelling content and storytelling that addresses the listener in a way that encourages interaction. There\u2019s a few decades of experiments with this personal &amp; empowering mode of address in the self help / meditation / change your life audio genre\u2026\n\nI reckon the other big creative challenge is a really accessible intuitive and compelling site that hosts all the monologues collected and that feels \u201calive\u201d with the word of the community &amp; updates often. Think there are some beautiful solutions evolving with immersive web and web VR. The clouds documentary http://cloudsdocumentary.com/\u00a0 gives a nice example of fluidly exploring knowledge. But a challenge I\u2019ve encountered is that curating and ensuring that the content remains relevant can be a full time job. However perhaps if you\u2019ve got a strong interactive web design that role can be automated or distributed.\n\n@trythis Do you envision asking listeners to speak back to a particular question? That feels like it would have some good focus to it.\u00a0\n\nOn translating - I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a necessity to have local collaborators and fluent speakers of the language in the core team whenever this kind of knowledge share project runs.\u00a0Perhaps also\u00a0there\u2019s something to learn from Duolingo and it\u2019s method of getting language learners translating. There are so many language learning initiatives to encourage people back into learning languages other than english. If you can connect with people who are learning the language and you have the need for spoken translation, there's a useful\u00a0match.\n\nSpreading info, language learning, cultural sharing and circulating cheap creative technology &amp; making skills all feel like they go together well.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ve met a lot of people working with teaching languages that are dwindling in numbers. Teachers of the Maori language and the Khoisan languages of the San Bushman people. They have often complained how young people are led away from learning about their own culture by fascination in smartphones / iPads / all things modern. Combining cultural knowledge &amp; language learning with what is considered aspirational tech can be a big motivator. I\u2019ll expand on this in another post when further down the line with it.\u00a0\n\nPlease ping me if you post news on your projects &amp; @trythis I\u2019ll connect you if I hear back from Ngala.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-11-27 20:07:51", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:44.982930", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 768, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18323, "user_id": 145, "topic_id": 2138, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Purpose is a very individualistic thing</b>\n\n...so the best we can do here is simply continue to get\u00a0clear for ourselves of our own (subjective)\u00a0purposes (which it seems you are attempting to grapple with and articulate here,\u00a0bravo!), keep at it, just be careful not\u00a0to try and get everyone to agree to one purpose, it won't work, we are all\u00a0here at edgryders for different reasons, let's help one another get clear and be transparent about what these are, get these motivations and purposes\u00a0out as ongoing, naturally evolving processes...and\u00a0in this process,\u00a0mutual crossover and agreement will naturally occur and we can be happy for those brief moments of synergy....but we will need to be as equally happy as these synergies dissolve to form new directions, new purposes....trying to control any such\u00a0process will\u00a0simply end in folly, let our comings and goings\u00a0arise naturally without trying to put\u00a0it them\u00a0in\u00a0boxes\u00a0with labels like \"finished\" or \"done\" or \"purpose\".

Random exploration certainly works well for people like yourself who do have a good sense, and can self motivate to put the hard work in. Our choices on a random path are based on how far we can see. Is that not helped by a guide, and in this case the guide or teacher helps even if they can only see a little bit down the road.\n\nIf I were to take one thing from martial arts training, it would be the walking drills.\u00a0 These are learnt first, they can be taught by students who themselves have only a few years of training, yet they link deep within the art. Walking drills are scalable. They are developed by someone with mastery, but are then passes out as a piece of technology to learn. They are something that you have to do yourself, and yes you could get them from a book or video. On the other hand with people around, even those who are just ahead of you, you can get advice and be told your mistakes. You are on your own random path, but you have guides who can help you go further and faster.\n\nTo be honest I find your comment that Sal Khan is your \"best shot at access to an outstanding math teacher\" deeply saddening at many levels. I do agree mathematics education is a caricature, and spend a lot of time thinking about how this might be improved. As an example, here is <a href=\"http://maxwelldemon.com/2011/07/21/will-the-next-generation-act/\">one model that I wrote up with Vinay Gupta</a>. The most worrying bit though is the \"outstanding\". He is a good math teacher, but I have met several math teachers just here in North West Arkansas that I would consider better. I would not mind betting that some of the teachers you passed under were a good or better. On the topic of his teaching do not take my word for it, here are a couple of people I believe to be outstanding teachers discussing him.\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.mrmeyer.com/?p=13364\">Dan Meyer</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://fnoschese.wordpress.com/2011/12/02/you-khant-ignore-how-students-learn/\">Frank Noschese</a>\n\nYet I believe that Khan has certain unfair advantages that are seriously skewing the debate. The first is that his students are generally there willingly, in their own time. The second is that there is a pause button. The importance of this does present an important lesson in how to teach maths. Finally many of his students who are driving the debate, like you, have already discovered a broader view of mathematics before they come to him.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I think what is presented on his site is wonderful, but also think that mistaking it for outstanding teaching is worrying. The central reason is this: textbook companies. I talked about the dangers in my responses to Noemi.\n\nHow would I personally try to improve things:\n\n1) Have more faith in average teachers.\n\n2) Free teachers from constraints of too specific curricula.\n\n3) Try to give teachers time, space and funding to explore the good ideas of others and come up with their own.\n\n4) Help teachers talk to each other, and develop regional communities.\n\nMore practically in the short term a lot could be done with a large number of small grants available to any teacher who has a bright idea. A couple of million euros would get you a couple of hundred 1000 euro grants.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-07 14:36:04", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:38.900298", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 667, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [12884], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6354, "user_id": 3622, "topic_id": 6321, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Following a call today (22/05/17)\u00a0with @Nadia and @Noemi, we discussed the following points:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>1. Improving Newsletter circulation</strong>\u00a0\n\nWe currently have two email lists, a list of Edgeryders community members and one for the\u00a0opt-in newsletter. One suggestion was to send out a semi-regular newsletter to the former, however\u00a0without consent to use the email for marketing purposes this is not possible. One solution proposed: an option to ask new members if they would also like to opt in to the newsletter on sign up,\u00a0as\u00a0a way of growing our currently small newsletter circulation.</li>\n\n<li><strong>2. Identifying drop off points </strong>\n\nGoogle Analytics shows drop offs on different sections of the site - what can this tell us about improving the site flow? The consensus seems to be that the data is too broad (it covers all pages such as 404s, including old posts rather than relevant content) to be useful at this point - rather than delve into\u00a0this problem (which ties in to UX/Web\u00a0Design)\u00a0we have agreed to focus at this point on\u00a0increasing sign ups and newsletter subscriptions.</li>\n\n<li><strong>3. Weekly open call</strong>\n\n@Nadia\u00a0pointed out the weekly call is a very good gateway for new members to become active participants in the site - we will be emphasising this in our status updates and also picking a theme for the call each week.\u00a0This will be a talking point announced ahead of time that will complement the open ended conversation. We will be drafting a list of themes that can be picked from each week.</li>\n\n<li><strong>4.\u00a0Raising awareness of the Open Village event </strong>\n\nMore needs to be done to highlight the event in the proposal posts\u00a0(there is a lack of clarity about the event), which can be announced at the end of each post. I will be drafting a footer template for this purpose (and the following point).</li>\n\n<li><strong>5. Improving user engagement</strong>\u00a0\n\nWe are seeing a steady influx of new users, many of whom do not post or comment. What can we do to effectively incentivise new users to participate in the community? We discussed three strategies:\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Drive sign ups and traffic</strong>, inevitably a portion of these\u00a0new users will comment, increasing conversation and engagement on the platform</li>\n\n<li><strong>Highlighting comments of different posts</strong>, this means bringing forth the active community onto the front page or community main page,\u00a0inviting people to join in on the conversation.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Explicitely asking to comment</strong>,\u00a0which will be the purpose of the footer (it is important to communicate this not in a forceful, annoying way but as an invitation to join the conversation)</li>\n\n</ul></li>\n\n<li><strong>6. Improving Twitter connections</strong>\u00a0\n\nWe briefly touched on the idea of pinging users on Twitter for comments on articles.\u00a0I\u00a0see this rather skeptically,\u00a0if I know the person or am already involved in a conversation it can be a natural approach, but systematically picking users to mention\u00a0borders on spamming (I get a lot of irrelevant marketing mentions on my own Twitter handle and\u00a0invariably ignore them).\u00a0</li>\n\n<li><strong>7. Creating blog post for the weekend newsletter</strong>\n\nWe will be publishing the weekend newsletter as a blog post so it is not limited to email subscribers. We will also be sending out the headlines email on Monday, Wednesday and Friday from now on. @Noemi mentioned emails from Mailchimp get filtered as spam - not the case in my inbox but maybe for others?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nInput on all points\u00a0welcome.\u00a0Without going into Web Design / UX territory, which I have little knowledge of,\u00a0I\u2019m interested in thoughts on improving user engagement within the site for new users (so I'll leave it as an open ended question).\u00a0Wishing you all a good week.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5330e95ac600e3986dc97bfed4f507b2cdcd9b04.jpg\" width=\"450\" height=\"450\">\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-22 11:39:49", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:37.552022", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 727, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17116, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4117, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Easy :-)</b>\n\n<a href=\"/u/billy_smith\">@Billy_Smith</a>, everything needs to be OS.

I guess what she had in mind was probing the community for ongoing experiences that we could support: for example \"I am helping my friend to build the control interface of is own wheelchair\" or \"in my condo we are running a system whereby we check on each other every so often to make sure everyone is OK\", or \"I always wanted artifact/service X to help me cope with my health problems/disability, but I can't find it on the market, can anyone help me build it?\" Stuff like that.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-02-23 10:33:01", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:35.633398", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 172, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [14391], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31480, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 5547, "post_number": 34, "raw": "<b>We have the version_0 call:</b>\n\nIt's <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MjGniB5Rx2OA7KZoVTofecmrT6LCivQkjcHAxgyxA8s/edit#heading=h.xfrhrwk0tu7i\">this section here.</a>\n\n", "created_at": "2016-06-01 07:04:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:53.087797", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 28, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 10.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [31478], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1671, "user_id": 9, "topic_id": 1638, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<b id=\"internal-source-marker_0.2566658379510045\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; font-weight: normal; \"><span>It is partly due to the way in which I run my life, my limited resources and my spread it thin mentality that has meant I haven't been able to contribute quite as much as I would have liked to the EdgeRyders platform so far.<br class=\"kix-line-break\"><br class=\"kix-line-break\">So the Making a Living mission seems like an appropriate place to contextualise that position.<br class=\"kix-line-break\"><br class=\"kix-line-break\">It would make most sense to start with University as the beginning, since this is the moment in which for me the stakes are first raised and you suddenly find you're responsible for yourself, feeding, housing, watering etc.<br class=\"kix-line-break\"><br class=\"kix-line-break\">But before that, I'd like to outline the slightly absurd way in which I made money between the ages of 14-16, without turning this into an essay, this was highly formative to my understanding of the world \u2013 and perhaps if there's interest I can expand on this in the comments thread.</span>\n\n<span><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_Online\">Ultima Online</a> was the first <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMORPG\">MMORPG</a>, it had a monthly subscription of around \u00a313 \u2013 I had 7 accounts (\u00a391). If you followed the link, you should understand that UO was a world that was constantly online, with its own economy, its own housing market, its own culture. Individuals attributed real world value basically for two reasons; an exchange value between time inputted and the paid monthly subscription, secondly because some valued the world of UO over their 'real' life existence.<br class=\"kix-line-break\"><br class=\"kix-line-break\">Over the course of 2 years (although I played the game for 6), I made around \u00a315,000, which as a teenager still studying was fairly substantial. I did this in several ways that although I was unaware at the time parallel with 'real world' market activity. I sold gold pieces (the ingame currency), the exchange rate averaged 1 Million GP = \u00a0\u00a325. Transactions would take place like so: individuals would deposit money into my real world account, I would meet the individual at the bank in the game and transfer the respective gold pieces to their player character.</span>\n\n<span>I made these gold pieces primarily in 4 ways:</span></b>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><span>I ran 5 computers at once in my bedroom, one active account the other 4 script mining resources.</span></li>\n\n<li><b style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; font-weight: normal; \"><span>I kept a mental index and spreadsheets of the going rate for all items in the game, whenever I saw something at auction or for sale that I could profit on I would buy it, tactically I created monopolies on certain items (this was made easy by owning prime shopping real estate in game)</span></b></li>\n\n<li><b style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; font-weight: normal; \"><span>I bought accounts from Ebay with \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3, asset stripped them and sold them on for profit.</span></b></li>\n\n<li><b style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; font-weight: normal; \"><span>I scammed other players, through narrative and roleplay - myself and a guild of thieves befriended other guilds and took them for all we could, property, gold and weapons.</span></b></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<b style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; font-weight: normal; \"><span>This all came to an end as a viable form of income when the Asian markets cottoned onto what was happening and created 'gold farms' on a large scale and by this point the mechanics of the game had changed so significantly it ceased to be fun just to play it.</span>\n\n<span>It wasn't until I was about 21 that I realised just how much my time in Ultima Online had influenced my perception of the world, an intuitive understanding for complexity, rule breaking and market dynamics. But primarily it had given me an advantage in understanding exactly how online activity and relationships can translate into a realer meat space.</span>\n\n<span>Parallel universes aside, onto to when it gets real, \u00a0I chose art school, mainly because it seemed like the sort of place you could do anything, providing you could articulate a convincing argument and probably because I was an idealist, utopian, looking for a playground.</span>\n\n<span>During my second term at University I was offered a couple of weeks work through a family friend at a major satellite broadcaster that had recently created a team to do data mining and network analysis, at the time it wasn't clear how influential this kind of technology would become. This was the team I joined, I was literally text mining vast databases with my eyes for the first few weeks, from which I had to extrapolate useful but abstract datasets to capture viewing preferences, this was pre-netflix.<br class=\"kix-line-break\"><br class=\"kix-line-break\">It turned out I was pretty good at it and I was hungry in my desire to understand what this sort of analysis could do, fortunately because the team was small I worked alongside an industry leader in the field, who fed me everything I could possibly want to know about the work.</span>\n\n<span>At the time I was terrified by the prospect of governments using the same kind of data capture and this fueled a lot of personal research. The company hired me, insanely they did so for \u00a345,000 pro rata, at the time I also had a student loan, I worked all my holidays, remotely and traveled 3 days a week to London to work at their HQ, all whilst studying. My income was absurd \u2013 but it didn't seem like it was going to disappear anytime soon, I was reckless, I saved nothing.</span>\n\n<span>I paused work with them in the final year of my degree so I could focus my attention, in lots of ways this was a critical mistake but not one I foresaw. The 2008 crash occurred during my final term and the guaranteed job upon graduation evaporated.</span>\n\n<span>I'd invested over \u00a35000 in my final piece of work, in fact throughout this time I poured a stupid amount of money into the production of artwork. I couldn't pay this money back and through this and other complications, I crashed my credit rating and ended up with a CCJ (county court judgement), this wrote off all my bank accounts and left me in a situation in which I couldn't rent property, couldn't get loans, couldn't hold a phone contract and so I moved back in with my mum and got depressed.<br class=\"kix-line-break\"><br class=\"kix-line-break\">3 months past, I upgraded my web design skills, then something happened that changed almost everything. Some friends I'd been squatting with on and off with in London throughout my time at Uni occupied a large townhouse in Mayfair. I went to visit in the first week and never returned home. For the next 4 months we occupied buildings throughout Mayfair, running exhibitions, events and later a free school, The Temporary School of Thought \u2013 which was incredibly formative to every layer of my thinking but to much for me to go into detail here. Instead I'll detail the economics of the space that laid the foundations for 3 years of 'free living'.</span>\n\n<span>It's important to note here in the context of policy, squatting was banned last month in the UK but going back centuries squatting has allowed for a different mode of living, for an alternative production of culture, social innovation and for protest. It allowed for the occupation of unused properties by anyone, under civil law, previously without the risk of conviction. Understanding the value created in these spaces is not something I believe policy to be good at, it can't be easily quantified or measured.</span>\n\n<span>During this time we were a constantly mutating group of about 20-30 with a fixed core of 10. We ate, lived and slept together, we barely ever left the building, we gave our whole bodies to the endeavor we'd set for ourselves. As such we became and still are very close, this is my extended family, my support network that catches me when I occasionally fall (and vice versa).</span>\n\n<span>We were feeding on average 60 people a day, we got our food by skipping (/dumpster diving), from wholesale vegetable markets and supermarket bins. We got our toilet paper and other general amenities from the surrounding luxury hotels on Park Lane, their weekly skips also provided us with furniture. In return for the public events and the lived ethos we espoused people commonly brought us things we needed, or didn't need in many instances.</span>\n\n<span>It was the case that for 6 months we lived almost literally without money, instead we indulged a parasitic relationship with the waste of the city and society at large.</span>\n\n<span>The project came to a halt in early 2009 -we'd exhausted ourselves- and after being evicted after 72 hours of occupation from our final squat in central London, moving 3 van loads of accumulated stuff, including 2 full sized pianos, suddenly became much less amusing. We were all effectively homeless \u2013 we spread out between friends houses in South London and tried to figure out what to do next. On the third night, a group broke a new building, a 3 bedroom flat, there were 15 of us, the prospect of living 5 to a room with no public facing project didn't thrill me, I booked a coach ticket with my brothers paypal account to a close friend\u2019s in Bristol and left at 5am whilst everyone was sleeping. The others referred to this later disparagingly as PLAN X-ing.</span>\n\n<span>The next 6-8 months the group continued living together in the flat, whilst I moved between London, Bristol and Brighton \u2013 staying with friends, I traded my webdesign skills for food, coaches and couches. During this time I'd also won a small research grant from Brighton University to develop an online platform and experimental talks program. The hours I put in quickly outstripped any reasonable financial remuneration \u2013 but by this point I had adopted whole heartily an ethos of dramatically reducing my standard of living so to realise work that I could believe in and commit to without compromise.</span>\n\n<span>At the end of the year the group, the extended family, decided to squat a new building. Since friends were graduating, couches were running out and no one in my network needed a second website, I returned to London to squat again.</span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>The property we moved into was completely gutted, down to the brickwork, it had one sink and a toilet that just about worked. Some of the rooms were missing floors and we had to be creative with electricity. To be honest though it was perfect for us, it was a clean slate on which to build, we used hammocks to sleep in for the first few weeks whilst we scavenged local skips for wood and building materials, within a month we'd built high beds in every room, rebuilt the floors, a kitchen (with non-functioning concrete sink) and a bath that ran dirty water out into the guttering system.</span>\n\n<span>During this time I was living out of a single bag, from squatting to nomadism, I managed this by storing things at different peoples houses, traveling only with essentials. Those essentials were; cash, phone, wash bag, notebook, usb sticks, chargers and passport \u2013 this was all made manageable by having my brothers online paypal account, storing files online and a skype phone account.</span>\n\n<span>It's probably important to note at this point that in many ways squatting becomes and is a lifestyle, you don't need to do paid work much and you probably have more free time but the daily routine that you've elected for yourself involves building, maintaining, finding food and defending/occupying the building. You become acutely aware of the infrastructure that we're all so reliant on to survive. It's also important to note that people take different roles within this, you divide tasks and everything is shared communally, clothes, food, beds, possessions. It's only once you've established a secure space does any kind of plasticity of lifestyle choice re-enter the equation.</span>\n\n<span>It was this plasticity and the comfort that set in, having established our first long term squat that led me to change direction. I began curating and producing more art shows, my relationship to the world of contemporary art intensified and I fed my practice with scraps of freelance web design. After 8 months of stability, we were asked to leave the building, suddenly due to my commitments I couldn't spend nights cycling the streets looking for and entering empty buildings trying to find a new home. So renting started to look like the only option.</span>\n\n<span>At this moment I abandoned squatting but it was a difficult transition that I am heavily indebted to the generosity of friends for supporting, I couch surfed and house sat, whilst producing quite a vast body of work with no remuneration, I tried to accumulate enough funds to rent somewhere.

This turns out to be an important document: Belarus is to a large extent a planned economy, and its government takes planning seriously.\n\nHowever, <strong>the tradition of civil society contributions to this sort of planning exercise is tenuous at best</strong>. Belarus inherits from the Soviet era the notion of the State as the Prime Mover; it has both the structure (in this case, the <a href=\"http://www.economy.gov.by/en/about_ministry/subordinated/niei\">Ministry of the Economy's Research Institute</a>) and the legitimacy to do its own planning. There is no allocated space for the contribution of individual citizens, or small groups thereof. The Research Institute had clearly signaled that it would welcome our participatory exercise, but <strong>we were still uncertain of whether we could get high-quality participation from citizens</strong> most of whom had (1) no significant experience of first-person participation in collective decision making, (2) no guarantee that their hypothetical contribution would be taken on board and (3) probably some worry that advancing a radical proposal would get them in trouble \u2013 Belarus keeps a tight watch over expressions of free speech, both on- and offline (<a href=\"http://www.osce.org/fom/132866\">example</a>). Indeed, despite the best efforts of UNDP and other entities in facilitating citizen participation, many observers report civil society in Belarus as quite passive.\n\n<strong>As it turns out, we were wrong to be worried</strong>. Our impression was not that of a passive civil society at all. The workshop was deemed by all a success; despite some glitches, attributable to lack of experience, the room's mood was highly constructive and everyone left it a bit more optimistic than they had entered it. And most importantly, the citizen's suggestions were taken seriously into account: on January 9th the Research Institute wrote to UNDP to acknowledge the contribution, and let us know that 8 of the suggestions advanced during out workshop were incorporated into the NSSED. <strong>Number one has special significance, and was the one most passionately advocated by the room: provisions of special legal status for social enterprise and social innovation</strong>. I think it is not too much of a stretch to consider this proposal a direct result of the Spot The Future Belarus project: as we engaged with social innovators, we saw them struggling by trying to fit their activities \u201con the edge\u201d with legal provisions written with normal businesses in mind. This makes for a striking difference with what we see in the European Union, with its array of legal and financial instruments for social enterprise and social innovation, and made us conclude that social innovators in Belarus are really fighting an uphill struggle, much harder than the one (already hard enough, thank you very much) of their Western European counterparts.\n\nSo, we win this one, I think. But that does not close the bigger issue: <strong>Edgeryders depends on open societies to function</strong>. All our methods require openness of process and free circulation of information: people find us by peer-to-peer referral on the open web; decide to engage out the kindness of their heart, or sometimes because they take up a job with us, but they always do so in the knowledge that <strong>there is no penalty for trying to build a better world</strong>. Out-of-the box, even subversive thinking is encouraged and rewarded, not only by Edgeryders but by society at large \u2013 or at least, lip service is paid to it.\n\nIn Belarus, we have found the culture to be much less enamoured with subversion and disruption; as a consequence, social innovators tend to take a more nuanced approach. <strong>They still think way out of the box, but many of them prefer to keep a low profile on it</strong> \u2013 in fact, many have declined to be featured on our blog, despite it being 100% legit (we operated under UN aegis and within line of sight of the Research Institute of the Ministry of the Economy, so arguably of the Belarusian state itself). They seem to think publicity, even when highly positive, is a liability for what they do. This is a serious problem, because, by lying low, these innovators are not inspiring others to ride their own edge, and are not sharing knowledge about their approaches, successes and failures \u2013 and this might result in duplication of effort. Interestingly, the same people seem to have no problem in making general points to advise their own government \u2013 indeed, this is what happened in the workshop.\n\nWe at Edgeryders make a point of being transparent and sharing what knowledge we might have. That includes publishing on the web any report we produce. But in the case of Belarus, we decided to prioritize the concerns for privacy expressed by the people who entrusted us with their experiences over our own preference for \"working out loud\"; we moved most of the about-project conversation off-platform, and we turned reports over to UNDP,\u00a0 letting them decide who gets to see what. At the time of writing, they seem inclined to publishing our methodology report, with all names omitted, from their <a href=\"http://www.by.undp.org/content/belarus/en/home/ourwork/povertyreduction1/overview/\">Social Innovation Lab page</a>. If you want to know more, we suggest you contact Olga Saet: olga [dot] saet [at] undp [dot] org. Individual stories of those social innovators who have consented to be featured on the blog have always been publicly accessible from the <a href=\"/t/mission-belarus/417\">Mission: Belarus</a> project page).\n\nAt this point, we feel it is also safe enough to divulge the position paper itself: you can download it <a href=\"/t/civil-society-position-paper-on-sustainable-development-in-belarus/4086\">from this page</a>.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-02-06 10:02:41", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:23.148683", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1047, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 95.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 173], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33, "user_id": 4922, "topic_id": 27, "post_number": 1, "raw": "LOTE6 \"The OpenVillage Festival\" happens 19-21 October 2017 in Brussels\n\nAnd this is where it's organized.

Build it together.\n\n[details=Show more]\n\n\n## A Unique Experience\n\nWe will have several roles: session leaders, curators, support team. But not spectators.\nWe will have diverse kinds of activities: Project Talks and Panels to get on the same page, Fishbowls/ Workshops/ Masterclasses to dive deep, Co-design Sprints and work-together sessions to transform knowledge into outcomes. Not least, self-organised evening sessions will fill up the schedule.\n\nThe event is designed to: encourage maximum manageable diversity of participants in a process engineered to ensure respectful and constructive interaction between everyone involved.\n\n\n## Themes\n\nHow do we take care of one another as welfare models and systems are failing us? The program is curated to cover community questions and areas of inquiry which have emerged over the last 18 months of conversations, workshops, project collaborations. Each theme approaches care provision from a different angle and includes several sessions in-the-making. \n\n1. **Open Science and Citizen Science for more inclusive healthcare**\n\n    How are people all over the world using open knowledge, open source hardware and software solutions to meet care needs? What are we learning about citizens helping advance groundbreaking research?\n\n    **Curated by Winnie Poncelet** (Reagent, Ekoli, Open Insulin global). A mix of engineer, biologist, entrepreneur and storyteller. Works to render science and technology more accessible to diverse groups, including the traditionally marginalized.\n\n2. **Architectures of Love: Creating the conditions for open care**\n\n    We\u2019re collecting deep insights from citizen-led care to illuminate the enabling factors that encourage our natural impulses as human beings to care for one another. How might these insights reshape how we understand the role of policy so it enables rather than displaces peer-to-peer care.\n\n    **Curated by Gehan Macleod** (GalGael Trust). A community organiser who co-founded GalGael - a social solidarity organisation whose collective works together on the demanding common tasks that demonstrate ways of living with more humanity in our times. Gehan lives in Glasgow, Scotland.\n\n3. **Health Autonomy: Living and working well together**\n\n    Learning from the people and projects who experiment with new tools and practices embedded in communal living and working. How do we build autonomy, sustainability in the backdrop of failing health systems, political and socioeconomic crises?  \n\n    **Curated by Francis Coughlin** (Woodbine.nyc). A medical doctor, resident in a public hospital in NYC and a member at Woodbine, Frank is dedicated to build infrastructure for generative communal health care.\n\n\n## Program\n\nThe most up to date program is announced [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/final-openvillage-festival-program-released/7105/4).\n\nAlso: [A Note from the Curators.](https://edgeryders.eu/t/openvillage-program-and-curators-note/6632/3)\n\nWant to lead a session or host an event?

You're good at explaining this stuff in simple, clear terms, that is, good at understanding it ... .

I'm following the per-nation totals of these in long term charts over at <a href=\"http://www.querschuesse.de/target2-salden/\">querschuesse.de</a> (see auto-translated <a href=\"http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.querschuesse.de%2Ftarget2-salden%2F&amp;act=url\">English version</a>). Provides the best coverage of this that I'm aware of. So I get a bit more freightened every month as the numbers come in ;) and have a rough idea how this system works, but I'm lost when it gets to details and effects. Looked at your arxiv paper and got nicely reminded of my own time with pdfLaTeX :) but lack the time and resources to dive into all this. A part of me wants to, and I'm always happy to understand a bit more when explained like you do, but then, it's not my area of expertise ...\n\n(That's also what makes me such a fan of these \"simple\" alternative currencies ... it's hacker ethics to only use a system you understand. You seem to share similar values, as you build models of what's happening in the <em>current</em> system ...)\n\nBack to Target2. Do you think the current Target2 situation can have any major (crash style) consequences, or will it \"just\" cause bank liquidity problems like now? From what I understood from Stephan's (above linked) site, negative Target2 balances are essentially accumulated national current account deficits (coming from trade deficits inside a too inhomogenous Euro zone, unable to be prevented by devalueing national currency as before). If so, then there are several hundred billions of debts out there that cannot be repaid from southern to northern national central banks via the ECB. And I wonder if that has potential for a new financial-economic crash? Over here, this is still a fringe topic and most economists seem not to care and / or not to understand ...\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-02 20:51:36", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:45.998531", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 399, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 1.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10926, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 3496, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Just confirming that all was delivered on location in time</b>\n\nTask closed.

Easiest thing in cooperation terms, since it is formalized: no needed for long communications threads if somebody wants to earn their ticket by providing the \"standard services\" for LOTE. In the catalogue, we also tell people the max. price that LOTE will accept for people's offers, based on the daily rate and (for things like hosting etc.) our gut feeling.</li>\n\n<li>We also set up one task on edgeryders.eu in the LOTE4 group, linked back and forth with a corresponding Makerfox catalogue entry. In this task, people can discuss publicly about the service (needed, since Makerfox has no public discussion space).</li>\n\n<li>We encourage people to create their own tasks in the LOTE4 group if they want (offers from the \"ticket demand side\" as Alberto proposed). In the task, we will negotiate a daily rate based price tag with them. For the transaction, we have two options:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Using Makerfox Products: Let the users create a corresponding Makerfox custom product (!) offer, get to know the link in the task thread, then order it on Makerfox with the LOTE4 user.</li>\n\n<li>Using Makerfox Transfer: Once agreeing on a price in the edgeryders.eu task, the LOTE4 user will just wire the Makerbucks to them with the Makerfox Transfer feature. I propose to go this way, as it avoids the redundant effort of creating a product offer on Makerfox, the confusion because it's not really a public offer but just meant for the LOTE4 user, and the communication overhead of having to post the offer link back on the edgeryders.eu task thread. Deals that include the ticket are still found automatically.</li>\n\n</ol>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nSo the principle would be: cooperation happens in edgeryders.eu tasks, trading / accounting on Makerfox, and both are linked with URLs. Task prices would be agreed on before based on worktime estimates \u2013 not what Nadia wanted initially, but it makes things simpler in cases where the task is done right at the conference, and allows to use the Makerfox platform for trading. (Such estimates are not really a danger for those offering, since miscalculating an offer in the range of 2-3 days will mean just a few more hours of working.)\n\nFurther simplifications welcome, else I'd propose to use this setup.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-07-29 18:00:11", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:46.439235", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 497, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [19063], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19177, "user_id": 9, "topic_id": 4339, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>Specifically </b>\n\nI am referring to this section that was added with the latest update, not the licensing we have previously discussed, which is a pretty significant addition:\u00a0\n\n\"<span>Shared ownership of community projects</span>\n\nAs an experiment in decentralised organisation structures, we need rules to ensure everyone can build on shared value to develop projects in whatever direction they like, without getting in the way of others who wish to do the same.

At \\#LOTE4 I hosted a session with Remy focused on Hacker Care, and open source approaches to health. Which subsequently EdgeRyders LBG mounted a H2020 bid for funding on - as <a href=\"http://The%20idea%20first%20came%20in%20the%20context%20of%20a%20LOTE4%20session%20proposed%20and%20led%20by%20R%C3%A9my%20Cagnol.%20%20-%20See%20more%20at:%20https://edgeryders.eu/en/opencare#sthash.VdmT6zTn.dpuf\">cited on the group page</a>\u00a0\"<span>The idea first came in the context of a LOTE4 session proposed and led by R\u00e9my Cagnol\"</span>\u00a0(although you've conveniently managed to redact my name from attribution, which must mean the CC-BY thing is really working well here). \u00a0\n\nNow this session was derived from a number of conversations, ideas and workshops that were intended to be deployed into other initiatives, including people not attached to ER, but myself and Remy proposed the session and ran it at \\#LOTE4 because we thought it would be of interest to other EdgeRyders - not because I had any interest in articulating and developing these ideas within the EdgeRyders space. So understandably the H2020 application came as quite a surprise.\u00a0\n\nPreviously you have made claims of enclosure when I've raised this, pushing me into the position of not being \"open\". I'm sorry but this isn't the case, I was merely not aware that everything that touches the EdgeRyders platform and space, is eligible for an EdgeRyders LBG project. Whilst you have contacted me very recently to make me aware of the bids submission and suggested that if successful we might discuss my involvement in the project, this is irrelevant to the way in which I'd imagined any such initiative might proceed - it feels to me as a community member incredibly opportunist and not what I signed up for. I wish you luck in the project, and I hope that it proves to be enjoyable and profitable undertaking for EdgeRyders LBG, but this is not mine nor do I think most peoples approach to collaboration.\n\nNow you can continue to tell me that I am being unreasonable, attempting to enclose 'community projects', etc but this is a public space, people are reading this and people aren't stupid when it comes to their time and investment or what they might consider to be best practice for developing work and initiatives within the commons. If you think my words are unfair, please respect that this addition of legal addendum's as if it's no big thing and many of the other experiences I have highlighted in the past months have caused me to call into question much of what I trusted before and seriously reconsider the way in which I contribute here.\n\nIt feels really important at this point for the health of the overall community that there be a separation between EdgeRyders LBG the consultancy (legal infrastructure) and EdgeRyders Community\u00a0(platform).\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-04-27 19:54:42", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:46.964998", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 971, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [19118], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21016, "user_id": 10, "topic_id": 1388, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Mmusic!</b>\n\nHey MissyK8!\n\nI totally resonate with what you wrote! I am not musically gifted, I am not endowed financially either, and sharing music is the least I could do to put that brilliant music out there.\n\nI'd like use the opportunity and share a short story that happened to me recently. For about a year now, I've had this healthy obsession with a 'style' of progressive rock/metal called <a href=\"http://got-djent.com\">DJENT</a>. In order to overcome this obsession, to get it out of my system (for a while) I felt like doing a Djent Night at one of the pubs in Cluj (the city I study in). I talked to the owners, and they said \"Cool, how about the day after tomorrow? We had to reschedule an event and the night is free\". It was kinda soon, but I accepted. That night I made the poster with one of my roommates, created an <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/383845938316191/\">event on Facebook</a>, invited people, shared it and that was it. No time for better advertisement. Given that it was the week of Easter, and because this kind of music does not enjoy too much popularity in Romania, the crowd wasn't that big, but it was awesome!!!\n\nThe hype has been building up on Facebook when people were saying how much they were waiting for such an event/for such music to be played. As far as I am aware it is the first Djent party in Cluj and probably even the first in Romania. Because at parties here, people are used to listen to the old familiar songs, it was really interesting to follow people\u2019s expressions, reactions and attitudes when they were exposed to stuff they were hearing for the first time in a public place or even for the first time at all. People came up to me and asked who was playing, what exactly Djent was, greeted me for the initiative, offered me drinks and even asked to do it again.\n\nI was lots of fun\u2026an emotional, psychological, mental relief/relaxation and physical recharge for me and hopefully for the others as well.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-16 15:22:07", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:56.920862", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 381, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6483, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 6450, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<h2 class=\"content-section\">Community Call 12/7: Play date with GraphRyder!\u00a0</h2>\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/998ab744907c3766fe6f18bcfac01be7c6b634c1.PNG\" width=\"690\" height=\"223\">\n\nA one hour\u00a0online demo and interactive event\u00a0where participants learn to read\u00a0the opencare community network graph!\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>What do participants mean when they\u00a0talk\u00a0about care?</li>\n\n<li>Which aspect of care are you are interested in?

I've developed a couple of websites for free over the years. Generally get enthused about other people projects and help them out on them anyway I can. I've put out a few free 3d models online for people to use. Small things like that rather then some overt gesture. I've done a bit of charity work here and there. I'm involved recently in a founding of a art school/art studios that hope to provide art access and cheap art workspaces, this is sharing of sorts as well, but I would be more comfortable declaring it as such when the project actually starts.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>The type of thing I appreciate other people sharing:</strong>\n\nI've gotten alot from open source code, i develop games and the development time would increase dramatically if it wasn't for this sort of resource. I'm a big believer in this sort of shared intellectual property.\n\nOn a smaller scale I get alot from friends, a lift here, a free meal there, adds dramatically to my overall quality of life.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>Overview:</strong>\n\nI think it is larger the culmination of these small kindnesses that improve peoples lives on a day to day basis, from friends and family. It is difficult to facilitate this fromt he top-down as it works on a personal level.\n\nOn a grander scale helping 'resource sharing communities' would be useful. By this i mean communities such as those that develop free code librarys or those that bring together information in other ways with no other intention then the benefit of others. As a creative i've found great use in resources of medieval illustratons, as a student benifitted from free collections of scholary papers and articles, etc.\n\nThis sort of sharing has been enabled by the internet and if were supported in some greater way would benifit society as a whole. I wouldn't think monetary incentives would be much use though, (even on a business level the results of their use of employees is dubious) it would have to be something more subtle to encourage such behaviour.\n\nThis applies to physical properties as well of course, but due to the set-up of society as a whole it's harder for these sort of projects to to manifest themselves effectively on a large social level.\n\nWhen I think about sharing, I always come to the conclusion that enabling a larger culture of sharing would be of benefit but draw a blank as to how this can be made to happen on a wide scale. In certain aspects the idea of sharing runs counter to the ideas pushed onto us by advertising and media that encourage focus on the individual and possession oriented thinking\u00a0 (this being of benefit economically)\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-20 11:29:06", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 04:45:34.819769", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 532, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3283, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3250, "post_number": 1, "raw": "I know the mayor of Nursia, birthplace of, well, Benedict himself.

Many of us have a hard time keeping track of everything. This is a general update on where we are; what we learned; what we expect to be doing next; and how you can be involved in it. Warning: it's quite long, about 2,600 words. Expect about 10 minutes reading time. Here we go! \u00a0\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">What we have done</h3>\n\nLet's set the start of the latest work cycle at November 1st 2014. During the previous summer we had concluded the <a href=\"/t/spot-the-future-final-reports-delivered-ish-linkedin-recommendations-available/3435\">Spot the Future</a> project. In October the Italian city of Matera, home of the first unMonastery and one of our key partners, <a href=\"/t/8-moves-that-worked-for-matera-to-win-the-european-capital-of-culture-2019-title/3959\">was crowned European Capital of Culture 2019</a>. In late October we returned to Matera for Living On The Edge 4. We allowed ourselves a small celebration and started looking around for what was next. And that turned out to be:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Developing a presence in the European Capitals Of Culture scene</strong>. It just made sense. Edgeryders had made a big, acknowledged contribution to the Matera success story. Some people in the community are artists, and many more care about culture. By being global, we are well positioned to help candidate cities to position their bids on the European scene. There are two or three ECOC competitions every year. And the most compelling argument of all: in this space, we could work with Robert \"Bob\" Palmer. Bob is Europe's most senior cultural policy expert. We all stand to learn much from him. So we built something we are calling the Edgeryders Culture Team. Its first post-Matera success was <a href=\"/edgeryders.eu/en/spot-the-future-bucharest\">getting hired by another candidate city, Bucharest</a>. The city's bid earned it the inclusion in the shortlist of candidate ECOCs still in the race for 2021.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li><strong>Getting better at helping smart, resilient civic processes to grow</strong>. We <a href=\"/t/future-makers-nepal/598\">set up shop in Kathmandu, Nepal</a>, and joined in the grassroots relief effort after the 2015 earthquake. \u00a0Matthias and Natalia, who led the effort, ended up working side by side with incredible grassroots groups. Many of these reach deep into rural Nepal, where neither government, nor established NGOs, nor media would go. Smart, committed, resilient, these groups might be the backbone of Nepal's emergent alternative leadership. Later in the year, we worked with the United Nations Development Programme and United Nations Volunteers to develop <a href=\"/t/future-makers-global/599\">a new, radical program of community-driven, bottom up urban planning</a>. \u00a0With the help of our global community, we discovered and reached out to civic innovators in Armenia, Belarus, Egypt, Georgia, Morocco and Ukraine. As often before, this work left us in awe of just how good people are at self-organizing, even in difficult circumstances.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Adding capacity for analysis to the Edgeryders platform</strong>. With the support of the Rockefeller Foundation, we developed and tested <a href=\"/t/open-ethnographer/578\">Open Ethnographer</a>, a Drupal module for in-platform ethnographic coding. It works. We also collaborated with a European Commission-funded research project called <a href=\"/t/catalyst-collaboration/426\">CATALYST</a>. CATALYST's mission was to develop software, that would extract collective intelligence from online conversations. We did some testing for them, and ended up adopting two of their applications. This makes us better at delivering collective intelligence outcomes from the Edgeryders conversation.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Engaging in a sales push</strong>. As we felt we had delivered \u2013 even overdelivered \u2013 on our first batch of projects, we tried to get more of them. The idea was to provide more meaningful, paid work for members of the Edgeryders community to take on. Get paid to be radical, do adventurous stuff and attack big problems: that's what most of us aspire to. But that did not go so well. We spent a lot of time negotiating and writing proposals. Sometimes we were successful, like in the examples above. But often, too often we just wasted valuable time in unsuccessful bids. We lost two procurement competitions in Italy, one in the UAE, and one in Belgium. We partecipated in five proposals for European research projects, losing three of them and getting kicked out of another one. We did win the one where we had invested the most, though.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">What we have learned</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Open online conversations can be an engine of collective intelligence</strong>. For me, this is the single most important lesson I have learned in Edgeryders. Every single time we convene around an interesting question and are enabled to act upon it, we make progress. The conversation acts as a sort of artificial intelligence. It discovers new allies, even on unfavourable terrain; processes scenarios in parallel; reveals rough consensus. It is hard to get it started, but when it gets going it really is powerful.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li><strong>Text is data</strong>. Collective intelligence in Edgeryders is a human thing. Its engine is human conversation, and it is humans interpreting its results. But technology helps in various ways. The most important one is this: with technology, we can understand conversations at a larger scale than without it. \u00a0This opens up exciting possibilities. It also means we are, in our own way, a data company. I have been\u00a0<a href=\"/t/this-is-your-land-edgeryders-as-an-engine-of-collective-intelligence/3364\">saying this since 2013</a>, but the past year has made this intuition more concrete.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li><strong>Sustainability is hard, but achievable</strong>. At the core of Edgeryders there is a symbiotic relationship between an online community and a small social enterprise. The community contains the skills, the drive, the experience. The company transforms online debate into expert advice, powered by collective intelligence. Expert advice can be packaged and sold. The Edgeryders company styles itself a mutant boutique consultancy company; it makes the sales. It then gives back to the community, in the form of work opportunities that are meaningful and paid (in financial year 2014-2015 we have paid out hard cash to about 40 edgeryders, not counting company directors). This is the theory. In practice, selling is hard. Clients think we are interesting and innovative, but would rather not be the first ones to adopt. We have to be honest, and tell them this is new and experimental. It may fail. Worse: collective intelligence does not take orders; if online debate sees an inconvenient truth, it will throw it in your face. \u00a0So, we tell them: if you are not prepared to face hard truths, don't hire us. Many clients feel this is too scary. \u00a0A few do take the plunge. So far they seem to be happy, and come back for more business. So it's working, kind of. People in the company are putting in a lot of unpaid work. We may fail due to mistakes or bad luck, but sustainability is certainly possible in principle.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Deploy</strong>. International consultants jet over to foreign capitals; stay at four-star hotels with English-speaking staff; have meetings with government officials; jet back; write the report. Edgeryders rents homes and moves in for months at a time. We hang out in the local hackerspaces, venture out to remote villages, build trust, spend time. It's necessary to gain trust and learn to see with the eyes of the local changemakers. It's also more fun. It just feels right: we may have a different role, but the people we meet in our missions are exactly people like us. They could be Edgeryders. Some have become Edgeryders, in fact. So we treat them as peers, learn from each other, refuse to think of them as passive \"beneficiaries\" of what our clients are trying to do. \u00a0There are people in Edgeryders who value adventure, and will <em>only</em> do work if they can do it this way. This gives us an edge: we can do stuff that vanilla consultants can't. We have a lever for reinventing international consultancy!\u00a0</li>\n\n<li><strong>Community is powerful</strong>. Collective intelligence is what happens when the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Collective smarts need not only smart individuals, but also a smart way for individuals to interact. The great lesson we learned from monasticism: human-to-human rules for interaction are important. We have found a name for a coherent collection of such rules designed to encourage the emergence of collective intelligence: <a href=\"/t/protocol-0-1-engineering-human-to-human-interaction-for-working-together/4748\">Protocol</a>. \u00a0I believe good Protocol is the single most important ingredient of an online community. I also find Edgeryders has, in general, good Protocol. Sniping, name-calling and rhetorical smoke curtains are almost unheard of. At the same time, people are outspoken, if respectful, in their expressions of disagreement. When Edgeryders is at its best, people argue hard enough to discourage wishful thinking and unsubstantiated claims, but not so hard as to demoralize each other. Action carries more prestige than talk, and no one has veto power over anyone else. Rapid progress ensues. A sign that this is working well: \u00a0it produced \"blanket endorsement\", with some of us willing to support financially complete strangers to take part in an Edgeryders event. This conveys a powerful message: \"If you are Edgeryders, I trust you, whoever you are.\" \u00a0</li>\n\n<li><strong>Community is fragile</strong>. One or two defectors with good rhetorical skills can break Protocol and upset a whole community. We had some episodes of this in Edgeryders. While unimportant in themselves, they were upsetting and time-consuming. We have learned never to take Protocol for granted, and to defend it at all costs. This means having low tolerance for trolling. If people do not feel completely at ease with Protocol, they should feel free to leave in friendship. <a href=\"/t/edgeryders-and-unmonastery-what-changed-and-what-remains-the-same/4991\">This happened last year</a> with some of the people involved in Matera's prototype unMonastery. Bickering about consensus decision making versus do-ocracy was improductive and frustrating. So they created their own organization, and now we have two variants of the unMonastery, one committed to consensus, the other to do-ocracy. Great! We can experiment with two alternative models, and learn from both.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li><strong>Dyson sphere</strong>. There's plenty of skilled people in the Edgeryders community. Together, we can supply a wide range of products and services. Whenever the Edgeryders the company needs to hire, or buy a service, we try to buy it from the community. We try to recirculate every euro that we get from clients, so that it helps some community project stay up. We think of this as building a Dyson sphere around the primary client; together, we can catch and reuse most of its economic energy. Example: <a href=\"/t/development-started/5126\">we hired </a><a href=\"/u/gandhiano\">@gandhiano</a>\u00a0to do work on our platform, and are planning to move its hosting over to the Ecobytes collective. This helps us, because we get a better platform and better services. It also helps Ecobytes' cash flow. Double win!</li>\n\n<li><strong>Take responsibility for the boring admin stuff</strong>. At the onset of the Edgeryders company, a member on the board of directors took on responsibility for all things legal and financial. That was a bad idea. The person made sure he was the only one with access to the bank account. This resulted in a complete lack of transparency about Edgeryders legals and financials. The rest of us in the board underperformed, too. We let him get away with this behaviour for a long time, because we were conflict-averse. When we finally applied pressure to set up transparent accounting, he resigned. He refused to release records, so \u00a0we had to report it and him to the British tax authority and rebuild them. As we did so, we discovered unpaid bills, unrecorded income, \u00a0unjustified payments (including to himself), out-of-date legal records and other pleasantries. This is not one person's failure, though we did pick a bad apple. The whole board has legal responsibility. It was our mess, and we had to clean it up. We decentralized accounting and finances, and increased transparency. We redid the <a href=\"/company/home\">company website</a> disclosing relevant information, recruited advisors from the community with oversight capacity and are now taking turns running the accounting software. Accounting and finance are boring, but we have to take responsibility for them. Dumping it on a \"money guy\" (or woman) is irresponsible.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">What's next and how you can be part of it</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Platform overhaul</strong>. As Edgeryders evolves, the edgeryders.eu platform must evolve too. We have started a major overhaul. The look and feel will change, and many tedious bugs will die. We estimate that the next incarnation of edgeryders.eu will go live some time in March 2016, and serve us until the end of 2017. After that, though, we might have to switch to a completely different core tech. Drupal 7 won't be here forever. In about one year we will start discussing out long term option. You can be part of the current effort helping <a href=\"/u/gandhiano\">@gandhiano</a>\u00a0test his <a href=\"https://test.edgeryders.boa.ecobytes.net/\">development site</a>. Follow updates and take on tasks on the <a href=\"/t/edgeryders-dev-testing/331\">Edgeryders Development Group</a>.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li><strong>LOTE5</strong>. Fail/unFail, the 5th episode of Living On The Edge is coming soon to Brussels. We have partnered up with <a href=\"http://www.antiheroes.org/\">Antiheroes</a>, part of the community since 2014, to build an <a href=\"/edgeryders.eu/en/lote5/welcome-to-lote5\">event centered on failure</a>. \u00a0<a href=\"/u/kiravde\">@KiraVde</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"/u/ireinga\">@ireinga</a>,\u00a0the Antiheroes ladies, are bringing to LOTE some much-needed light-heartedness and sense of fun. \u00a0I'm so looking forward to this! As always, plenty of ways for you to <a href=\"/edgeryders.eu/en/lote5/getting-your-ticket\">take part</a>.</li>\n\n<li><strong>OpenCare</strong>. This was our one successful European research proposal. It's big: 1.6 million euro, of which a bit under 300K administered directly by Edgeryders. It's also exciting. <a href=\"/opencare/welcome-to-opencare\">Look it up</a>, stay in touch, let us know if and how you want to collaborate. As always, we'll advertise any opening positions on the Edgeryders platform.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li><strong>Flagship projects</strong>. We want to build \"flagship projects\": big, bold, sustainable stuff, proposed by the community. If the idea is right, we might be able to build support and momentum around it. OpenCare is an example of a flagship project; the unMonastery is another one. There is space for a few more; get in touch and let's talk. But remember: if it's your project, you have to lead.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Incubator/accelerator</strong>. So far Edgeryders-the-company has been emergent, with almost no strategy. We don't take debt. We don't seek investors. We don't seek core funding. \u00a0We have no business plan. We take on paid work, trying to blend it in the community's interests as we go. We refused to do all the usual social startup stuff of investor pitching and spreadsheet compiling. That freed up time and energy to develop our product and test its viability. We now have a product: collective-intelligence powered expert advice, hacker style. We tested it, it's viable. Now what? We'd like to try and do more of it, faster. We are hackers (Matt, Vinay), researchers (Noemi, Asta, myself), designers (Nadia), organisation experts (Patrick, John). We need to boost our business skills and contacts if we are to run a \"real\" company.\u00a0But we are educable, so we are considering incubators/accelerators around the world. If you work in one, or are a mentor or coach, and you would like to work with us, get in touch. We accept that some pitching and spreadsheets might ensue. Hey, the revolution is no gala dinner.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li><strong>Develop a success indicator (and trust it)</strong>. Is Edgeryders successful? No one knows. On the one hand, we are not moving serious amounts of money. On the other hand, we do seem to have some access to power players and some recognition as trailblazers. I would like to combine monetary (contracts signed?) and non monetary (access to high-level people?) into a sort of \"life force index\" for Edgeryders. And then, make decisions on the basis of how the index moves. If you like this, let me know and we'll take it from there.</li>\n\n<li><strong>More sales</strong>. We are working hard to get new contracts and new clients. We'll be announcing deals as we close them.

Thanks for sharing!\n\nUnfortunately public spheres (politics, education, health, employment) are mostly slow at getting and applying innovation. I think that is especially true in the online world.\u00a0\n\nThe way we educate our children definitely needs a thorough overview and a prompt change. Although reforming the system of education will not only require transforming relevant legislations, curriculum, retraining of teachers and changing habits of schools but also changing habits of politicians and actually of all citizens :) \u00a0\n\nWe have a good track record of identifying the differences and thus we tend to develop an identity of being different than others which is many times interpreted as a \"bad thing\" in Europe. Our history has shifted us towards this approach.\n\nOne of the toughest habits I have been coming across as a child as well as a father of three is discrimination in school. The current educational system and the educational methodology used provides a real chance to less than 1% of all Roma/Gypsy children. Extreme right wing thinkers argue it's for the bad genes Roma/Gypsy (hereinafter referred to as 'Roma') have and when it comes to judging Roma than 6 to 8 ppl out of ten would think alike irrespective of political, religious background in all Central and Eastern European states. The same applies to media too.\n\nThe very first thing a Roma child is confronted with on the first school day in his/her life is that s/he is different, comes from a criminal group that lies, cheats and is stinky. These are the first attributes associated to our ethnic group. So how enthusiastic will you be with any kind of reform when you get this from school mates and many teachers also contribute to deepening the stereotypes against Roma kids in the class (Roma children sit in the last row in the class, they have a permission to miss out certain classes so they do not disturb the others, Roma children are overrepresented in special schools for physically and mentally disabled children etc.).\n\nSo I am definitely FOR changing the educational system but it should be done in a way where stereotypes are challenged and kids are completing projects in groups where they are always asked to join new and new groups.\n\nJust to show you guys how deep stereotypes are, check out this video. THis is 'Robika', a 7 year old Roma kid who just got featured in the Hungarian version of the x-factor talent program. In the last couple of days, he's been receiving a vast number of racist comments from tens of thousands of people across the country. Now you can imagine what this kid may expect to receive from the other pupils when walking in the classroom on his first school day.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peCv90NYoSY\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peCv90NYoSY</a>\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-10 07:48:50", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:01.620237", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 598, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9529, "user_id": 3074, "topic_id": 6280, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>relation to opencare's DoA</b>\n\nHello Matteo,\u00a0\n\nThank you for sharing information on your plans towards more exchanges between partners.\u00a0\n\nTo me, opencare's DoA meets what you just mention above, you are working in the right direction:\n\n(p.4) Excellence in research:\n\nSome activities in OpenCare will be directed towards its ultimate goal of contributing towards\u00a0care provision reform.

Usually they end up paying a small fine or getting a warning but they have lots of friends who are activists and have been imprisoned for years, so they never know what can happen to them next time as the police here is good at making false accusations and fabricating evidence.</em>\n\n<em>They are very enthusiastic young people in early 20ies, their parents are also activists(apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree) and I loved their energy. I was so excited about their project that I even offered my help any time they would need it. Here are the questions they answered:</em>\n\n<strong>How you got started and what is your current situation?</strong>\n\n\u201cWe started with the picture of a policeman beating a citizen on Knko Aper Library wall in Yerevan in 2012 and since then we react on political events that are happening in Armenia with our art works. Of course, when there is action happening, like the protests of <a href=\"/t/protests-in-armenia/4576\">ElectricYerevan </a>at Baghramyan ave. we need to be there directly involved and our art takes second place as we mostly create in standstill moments. \u201d\n\n<strong>Who's involved: \u00a0Who is in the team? Roles and responsibilities? Skillsets (what are individual team members good at?)</strong>\n\n\u201cWe discuss the ideas and realise the works all together. However Lusine is good with languages and she helps us a lot with our texts and slogans. She also takes care of our Facebook page. Herbert is our pro of computing design and Photoshop, while Artak takes care of technical details, like finding the necessary equipment, organisation, logistics.\u201d\n\n<strong>Any partnerships? </strong>\n\n\u201cWe do not have any official partnerships, however we have a large community of friends(activists, journalists, photographers, etc) who are always there to help us whenever we need something. When we do not have the money to buy material and we need to create a poster urgently, our friends have always contributed. \u201c\n\n<strong>What your main objectives are/why you do this?</strong>\n\n\u201cWe do this to self-express and to raise awareness of people in Armenia about existing political and social issues in the country mostly caused by the corrupt government. We want people to open their minds and think/act. We want an ideological revolution to happen and the corrupt regime to be toppled in Armenia. \u201c\n\n<strong>What you enjoy about the work and what you enjoy less?</strong>\n\n\u201cWe enjoy every stage of the work process. The most important for us is people\u2019s reaction and attention which is mostly positive(there is some negative feedback from people who think we spoil buildings, but our message is more important than some piece of paper that can be easily washed away, though sometimes the police try to destroy the walls to remove the paintings). We enjoy less the technical problems, like when we can not find a projector to print a large poster. But these are all solvable problems.\u201d\n\n<em>In the beginning they would say that there is nothing they do not like about their job and I asked how they feel about the police which is always there to destroy their art right after they install it. They said that if the police is involved then their work is a success as it means they disturbed them in way and that is a good thing.\u00a0</em>\n\n<strong>What kinds of tasks do you do on a regular basis? Yearly, monthly, weekly, daily</strong>\n\n\u201cWe never have a routine and our days are all different. We are following the political events closely every day, meeting and discussing/sharing ideas daily. There is a pattern when we are creating though. We first need to find a projector, then paper(Herbert gets it from the printing house where he works), tape(which is quite costly and we need large amounts) and paints. We save money every month to buy the pains we need, but even if we are short of money, we can always reach out to our friends and they will help and support us any time. Once we get all the materials we start drawing, either at Home 45 or on the rooftop of Armenian Center For Contemporary Experimental Art building.\n\nOnce it\u2019s done we decide where and when we install the painting. We need a clean smooth wall to paste the paintings on, either in a popular place for people to notice the message or in a strategic point for the government officials to see.\n\nDepending on the circumstances we do it at night if the installation is big and takes longer time to paste and during day time when the action is required urgently, the mission is not too dangerous and we need more people to notice it before it\u2019s gone. Generally we need to act very quick and it only takes us a couple of minutes to paste the painting on the wall. \u201d\n\n<strong>What, other than money, do you think could help you in your work?</strong>\n\n\u201cWe definitely need connections with similar art groups from abroad to support and motivate us. Also when we are arrested, it helps a lot when organisations from abroad could interfere or stage a manifestation against our imprisonment as this influences the local police to release us. \u201c\n\n<strong>What help could you offer others and under which conditions (assuming no money is involved)?</strong>\n\n\u201cWe could offer our experience, connections as well as political support , and accommodation at our art residency if needed.\u201d\n\n<strong>Products or services that you currently produce?</strong>\n\n\u201cWe react on political events by producing and installing paintings on the walls of the city with political context to raise awareness. Recently we have offered our help for any human rights organisations in Armenia no matter which political party they adhere to, to help with posters and design to make their messages more visible.\u201d\n\n<strong>How do you go about doing this- what steps are involved? Technologies or processes used?</strong>\n\n\u201cNo special technologies, except Photoshop and some other software for design.\u201d\n\n<strong>Costs: What expenses are involved? Who benefits from the work? Who currently supports it, how and why?</strong>\n\n\u201cWe pay ourselves for the materials, friends help as well. Sometimes we skip a meal or two to be able to buy some paints or tape. Citizens benefit from our work and it gives us a chance to self-express.\u201d\n\n<strong>Existing alternatives: Who else is doing similar or relevant work/offering similar things- locally and or elsewhere?</strong>\n\n\u201cThere is <a href=\"http://artlabyerevan.com/en\">Art Lab</a> in Yerevan but their projects are more artistic and have a social context vs ours works which mostly have political context. No one is doing similar stuff in Armenia.\u201d\n\n<strong>Important players affecting the work? (locally and internationally)</strong>\n\n\u201cWe love Banksy, Dolk and <a href=\"http://en.free-voina.org/\">Voina art group </a>from Russia. Art Lab is one of the most important players locally. \u201d\n\n<strong>Long term perspective: any Business or sustainability plan?</strong>\n\n\u201cOur perspective is as follows: to keep up what we are doing, work harder and produce more street art, without becoming commercialized and to be true to our ideas and philosophy. \u201d\n\n<strong>Transportation and logistics?</strong>\n\n\u201cOur friends help us with this. We got a large community of friends who support us. We are based at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/homefortyfive?fref=ts\">Home 45 </a>artistic residence that Artak rebuilt with his own hands and which is going to be destroyed any time. We got a <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/savehome45/x/11062057#/story\">crowdfunding campaign going on Indiegogo</a> to save that place. We plan to squat there till they come and take us out forcefully. \u201d\n\n<strong>Regulation and policy affecting your work?</strong>\n\n\u201cThe problem with Armenia is that there are no regulations or policy. Ok there is the constitution which is quite ok and could be nice if it was applied indeed but it is not. So we do not know how to act according to the regulations as there are none and whatever we do can be considered illegal because the laws don\u2019t work here.\u201d\n\n<strong>How about the concepts of Collaboration ..and Mutual Support?</strong>\n\n\u201cWe have hosted Russian anarchist/vegan activists\u2019 group that helped us install some of our works recently, it was a great collaboration and experience exchange. We are generally open to new collaborations with similar artistic groups from abroad\u201d\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c6dee5ff5f0442c19ea86501f79de2bfea306fb0.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"457\"><br>\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-09 20:02:54", "updated_at": "2018-06-05 14:51:32.908239", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2257, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 155.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17758, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 5547, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>No Idea how to do this</b>\n\n@Alberto?\n\n", "created_at": "2016-04-27 15:41:53", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:39.102564", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 11, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [15923], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26625, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 5785, "post_number": 11, "raw": "<b>Heads up: latest version of the pitch</b>\n\nThanks to @Alex_Levene we have a new version and gathering final feedback notes!

A reflexive design workshop lead by Prof. Ezio Manzini</em></strong>\n\n\"Collaborative inclusion\" is a reflexive design exercise to explore how collaboration between migrants and residents can strengthen the social fabric. More precisely, we look at what kinds of collaborative services (intended as result-oriented collaborations among different actors) can produce social, cultural and economic value. If you are looking for a well-designed process to explore how you can realistically contribute towards, and benefit from, collaborating with migrants then this workshop is for you. This event is run by a stellar team and lead by one of the leading authorities on design for social innovation and sustainability. <em>For more information and registration please visit the event page: \u00a0<a href=\"http://bit.ly/1Q16cic\">http://bit.ly/1Q16cic</a></em>\n\n<strong>26/2 at 16:00, Brussels:\u00a0<em>The tyranny of Benevolence - Moving beyond charity based approaches in refugee reception and inclusion</em></strong>\n\nMany well-meaning efforts to welcome and care for refugees employ charity-based approaches that position people currently in the asylum process as \u201cweak\u201d recipients of our benevolence. These narratives pigeonhole people now seeking asylum as costs to the system. In so doing they risk fueling mechanisms of exclusion, ensuring the newcomers will never be treated as equals in our communities. This workshop offers participants an opportunity to discover new approaches, methods and tools through which they can better achieve their objectives - without contributing towards the rise of ethnocentric nationalist populism.

As a result, we see initiatives, projects, movements popping up here and there that disappear quickly from lack of funding. Imagine how many wonderful things don\u2019t happen in the world because funding - which is oxygen for most organizations - is difficult to sustain. Without an easy way to raise and spend money, it\u2019s hard to manage and grow many of these seeds of an idea that could change the world.\n\nMeetups, open source projects, parent associations, neighborhood associations, pet projects, clubs, unions, movements, non-profits, business incubators - in order to operate, all of them are forced to use a physical glass jar, ask a sponsor to directly pay their expenses or front the huge overhead of setting up and managing a corporation or a non-profit. It\u2019s either inefficient and opaque or it\u2019s overkill.\n\nOpenCollective enables groups to quickly set up a collective, raise funds and manage them transparently.\n\nWe want all those seeds to have a chance to grow, to bring their ideas to life.

She also does things without any renumeration like her <a href=\"http://reboot.fm/category/sparkfm/\">monthly radio show</a>, organising a music festival which pays for itself but not for staff, as well as organising occasional concerts which pay something but don't financially compensate for the time invested.\n\nAndrea is trying to find a balance between doing things she finds interesting and making money. She says that it's not an easy balance, but she feels lucky as she has had the opportunity to make money with her previous job, and she still has some money left which enables her to subsidise the activities that she's interested in. This has done this on purpose by working longer on the recent job to buy time later to do things and be a bit more experimental, which is something she thinks is common amongst people who want to make things happen - \"the idea of making money in one field to spend in another is one way to do it, because if you try to make money with everything you do, you are very dependent.\" If you want to be free in what you do, you have to make the money elsewhere, she adds. She tries never to sell herself for something she finds completely useless, but has taken on less interesting projects as they have allowed her to do something else.\n\nShe is also a co-owner of newthinking and the company takes a similar approach too. In the past they have taken on things which were no so profitable but had a high content value, but it's only possible if other projects bring the cash in, so staff and everything can be paid for. Her lifestyle is based on low expense which means this strategy can work, but Andrea is aware that this is possible because she doesn't have a family.\n\n<strong>\"Making enough time\"</strong>\n\nSometimes it is better to invest a little in a project yourself than to look for funding, she says, as sometimes more time is spent trying to fund raise than on the project itself. From the experience of all2gethernow she has seen that it is very difficult to build something from a cultural, political interest and it make it financially sustainable. Consequently it is very ad-hoc, bringing people in to work on projects once they have been approved financially, because they have not been able to sustain a permanent structure. They would have to start a service, like consulting, to be able to do so.\n\nAndrea reiterates that she is not interested in making lots of money, that she wants to \"make enough time\" to do the things she's interested in, and create a sustainable life. She considers herself to be in a privileged position as she can think about and do things she cares about and knows there are many people who don't know how to do it, or can't do it because they have a lot of children and despite working hard, still don't earn enough money to make ends meet. Her way of living is more important to her than having a lot of money or the amount of goods she can buy.\n\nMany needs and desires have been created artificially in society, she feels, meaning that people think they need to have a car, lots of electronic equipment, have expensive holidays - but they are things which can be solved in a way which involves far less money, people could live with less money if things were better organised.\u00a0\n\nAndrea sees that there is a lot of money in certain areas and much less in others and oftentimes, thinking of the processes gentrification and city development, creatives and people who do things are being used and are necessary for others to make lots of money. There is a question of whether money is really being distributed fairly and how can the system be structured so there is a much more equal distribution. Concepts like a basic income or regulation of the amount a company or person can accumulate need investigating, and although this is theoretically done through the tax system we probably need more systemic changes, she concludes.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-11 12:33:08", "updated_at": "2017-08-27 14:52:36.786414", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1003, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20912, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5772, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Great  project!</b>\n\nBut, should probably be in the Agora group, not in the blog?\n\nAlso ping @Patrick_Andrews , he has experience with <a href=\"http://www.riversimple.com/\">Riversimple</a> (hydrogen cars).\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-07-20 09:33:27", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:56.342462", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 38, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 1.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10729, "user_id": 2333, "topic_id": 3448, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Going for it!</b>\n\nHere are the action steps as I see them right now:\n\n1.

During the last two months we went from being informed of <a href=\"http://rys.io/en/59\">planned ACTA signing</a>, through <a href=\"http://www.euronews.com/2012/01/25/protesters-in-poland-angry-about-acta/\">street protests</a> (spreading <a href=\"http://www.mediarp.pl/acta/mapa-protestow\">far beyond Poland</a>), so-called <a href=\"http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-736223\">\"attacks\" on Polish government websites</a>, <a href=\"http://rt.com/news/acta-poland-internet-government-745/\">the signing itself</a>, then attempts of <a href=\"http://panoptykon.org/wiadomosc/improwizowany-kongres-wolnego-internetu\">returning</a> to <a href=\"http://mac.gov.pl/bez-kategorii/premier-zawieszam-ratyfikacje-w-sprawie-acta-rozpoczynamy-debate/\">talks</a> and finally \u2014 <a href=\"http://rys.io/en/62\">complete reversal of the official government stance</a> and <a href=\"http://rys.io/en/64\">calling the treaty \"pass\u00e9\"</a>.\n\nIt was an important, powerful and extremely interesting outburst of <a href=\"http://rys.io/en/43\">so-called Internets</a> against something perceived to be a danger to the liberties and rights to use this great tool.\n\n<em>A note to English readers: wherever I could find English sources, I used them; however, many a time it was not possible, hence you will find many Polish links in this text. This post is also available <a href=\"http://rys.io/en/70\">outside EdgeRyders</a> (including <a href=\"http://rys.io/pl/70\">Polish version</a>).</em>\n\n<h3>\n\n<!--break-->Hit Fits the Shan</h3>First and foremost \u2014 none of participants to the memorable January meeting with the <a href=\"http://mac.gov.pl/\">Ministry of Administration and Digitalisation</a> expected what was going to happen.\n\nOn one hand, this is a statement of how trusting towards the government the NGOs had been (remembering the promise given on the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f8nLz94oQ8\">18th of May, 2011</a> that all works on ACTA shall be halted until all our questions are answered). On the other \u2014 a testament to just how completely ignorant of the importance of this treaty the ministries responsible for it in Poland \u2014 the <a href=\"http://www.mkidn.gov.pl\">Ministry of Culture and National Heritage</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.mg.gov.pl/\">Ministry of Economy</a> \u2014 had been.\n\nAfter casually remarking on the fact of the planned signing in one week's time (on the 26th of January), representatives of those ministries apparently intended to just move one to next items on the agenda.\n\nObviously, <a href=\"http://prawo.vagla.pl/node/9631\">at this point there were no other items</a>. Few seconds of complete silence followed: people from NGOs were trying to comprehend what exactly has just been said, while the host of the meeting, minister Igor Ostrowski, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/IgorOstrowski/statuses/159951110948397057\">published a single tweet</a> and sank into disbelief; representatives of the two responsible ministries themselves looked like rabbits caught in headlights, starting to slowly realise something bad is going to happen, but not really sure what and why...\n\n<h3>Internets awaken</h3>From this moment onwards everything has been happening with tempo that surprised everybody; after first information on planned signing surfaced, Polish Internet seethed with rage, just as it did two years before when ideas of network filtering and censorship surfaced (those have been dumped since). There were, however, important differences:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>many Polish Internet users, especially those more tech-savvy, followed the ACTA topic for years, hence the pressure and interest were already there;</li>\n\n<li>there were promises made by the government regarding the treaty and those were broken, so naturally people following the topic felt cheated;</li>\n\n<li>there was a concrete date set, in the nearest future, so time pressure was also there.</li>\n\n</ul>Additional crucial factor was provided by the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sopa_blackout\">SOPA/PIPA Blackout</a>, ending mere hours before ACTA signing plans surfaced. The public was well informed about dangers stemming from those and similar attempts to curtail Internet sharing and was interested in the topic. ACTA became a natural continuation for the SOPA/PIPA topics present in Polish media for more than a week by then. And it was something that actually applied to Poland.\n\nOne important thing to remember is that <strong>Poles still do remember vividly the communism years, police state and censorship</strong>. And vehemently oppose any attempts of bringing them back in any form.\n\nAll this meant that the energy of the outburst was significantly higher than two years before. During just few hours, instead of open letters and on-line petitions that had been the prime tool back then, real people organising true street protests and manifestations started to appear. What is essential (and very interesting in and of itself), these were completely spontaneous, grass-roots activities, not associated with NGOs that had been bringing up the ACTA problem for years (like <a href=\"http://panoptykon.org\">Panoptykon</a>, <a href=\"http://isoc.org.pl\">ISOC</a>, <a href=\"http://nowoczesnapolska.org.pl\">Modern Poland Foundation</a> or <a href=\"http://fwioo.pl\">Free and Open Source Software Foundation</a>).\n\n<h3>Ground rules</h3>Instantly we understood that \u2014 being the NGOs involved in the ACTA topic for years \u2014 our job is to take upon ourselves the role of experts and rudimentary coordinators; simply put, we would not find the time to do anything besides that (and my, were we right, we were completely swamped with this work for more than a solid month). Our tasks from that point on were:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>providing know-how, information, documents, statements regarding ACTA and related topics;</li>\n\n<li>reacting to whatever was happening (sometimes the situation was literally changing by the hour), including providing coherent communiques for and via media;</li>\n\n<li>attempting to influence the individual protest organisers from all around Poland to keep their protests peaceful, on-topic, organised according to law of the land and as far as possible \u2014 coordinated in time.</li>\n\n</ul>Completely organically we understood we need a <em>no-logo</em> rule \u2014 no party, group or similar logos, banners, flags, etc. Just protesting together against a single cause, not promoting our respective organisations. This <a href=\"http://magdalenaszecowka.wordpress.com/2012/02/02/rezygnacja/\">met with some dissent</a> at first \u2014 not surprisingly many entities tried to pin their names to this huge commotion. We all understood perfectly, however, that once any political party or group attaches their name to this informal movement, it would spell failure: we would get tagged and pushed into old categories, and hence trivialised.\n\n<h3>Sea of people</h3>And then came the day of protests \u2014 tens of thousands of people in the whole country decided to face the -30\u00b0C temperatures to voice their critical opinion over the treaty.\n\n<strong>There were no such protests in Poland at least since the 1980's</strong>. They covered the whole country, including smaller towns; they were peaceful and on-topic; they all concerned a single issue, and all had the same slogans on banners and being shouted by the protesters; people from all possible political groups and affiliations took part, often side-by-side with whom they normally perceived as enemies, and heeding the <em>no-logo</em> rule; interestingly, politicians that tried to hook themselves with the protests \u2014 <a href=\"http://wiadomosci.dziennik.pl/polityka/artykuly/376434,pis-i-solidarna-polska-przyznaja-sie-do-bledu-ws-acta.html\">all</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmN1yJOyc_s\">failed</a> <a href=\"http://planktonpolityczny.blox.pl/2012/01/Przeciwny-ACTA-wygwizdali-Korwin-Mikkego.html\">miserably</a>.\n\nThanks to excellent and coherent stance of the individual protest organisers it was possible to <a href=\"http://stopacta.com.pl/oficjalne-oswiadczenie-organizatorow-protestow-181/\">fend off politicization of the protests</a>; that made it possible for very different groups of people \u2014 from right-wing activists to anarchists, and everything in between \u2014 to stand together, protesting hand-in-hand against a common cause. No one felt uninvited because of their political views. And that meant more people protesting together.\n\nAn unintended consequence of this political diversity on the streets was that neither politicians nor media had a clue how to describe the movement, how to narrate about it nor categorize it. In no way did it fit the traditional ways of describing protests in Poland. That also worked in our advantage. <strong>It turned out that neither media nor politicians are able to handle truly grass-roots, spontaneous initiatives focused on particular issues, functioning over (or away from!) the usual political and social divides</strong>.\n\n<h3>Government websites get popular</h3>This inability to tag the protesters ended as soon as government websites got \"popular\" \u2014 as that is how the government spokesman at first described <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDoS#Distributed_attack\">DDoS</a> action by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_%28group%29\">Anonymous</a>. As soon as government officials understood their mistake, instantly they took the opportunity and started describing the anti-ACTA movement as \"hackers, terrorists\", \"attacking\" government websites.\n\nIt was so very convenient for the government as it made it possible to portray the protests in unfavourable way and gave the perfect excuse to discard valid objections of hundreds of thousands Poles:\n\n<tt>We will not succumb to blackmail.</tt>\n\nImmediately we saw that coming and tried contacting Anonymous in order to try and convince them to halt the attacks. To our surprise, <a href=\"http://blog.sirmacik.net/an-interview-for-cnn-ireport-about-polish-citizens-vs-acta\">it was effective</a>.\n\nStill, the \"blackmail\" excuse <a href=\"http://www.thenews.pl/1/10/Artykul/84150,PM-Tusk-stands-firm-on-ACTA-despite-internet-attacks\">has been already used</a> and ACTA got signed by the Polish ambassador on 26th of January.\n\nProtests, however, continued \u2014 and mainstream media started publishing opinion polls regarding them.\n\n<h3>Let's talk</h3>Apparently, that was finally something the government took notice of. Suddenly it became apparent that we're not some \"anonymous Internet users\", but living, breathing citizens, voicing our objections regarding something the government decided to do. We stopped being seen as some kids with a computer, <a href=\"/static/piracy-copyright-stealing-theft.png\">\"pirates\"</a>, <a href=\"http://catb.org/%7Eesr/faqs/hacker-howto.html\">\"hackers\"</a>; the government was starting to see that there are Voters in our ranks. And that made a world of difference.\n\nThe government switched into damage control mode and started frantically seeking ways of \"establishing a dialogue\" \u2014 in other words something we called for for years... Also, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rzecznik_Praw_Obywatelskich\">Polish Ombudsman</a> in her statement regarding the situation, called upon Polish universities to organise debates on the topic.\n\nWe decided to <a href=\"http://brama.elka.pw.edu.pl/home/564\">organise our own event</a>, to meet each other, get as many of the people involved in a single place and <a href=\"http://panoptykon.org/wiadomosc/improwizowany-kongres-wolnego-internetu-nagrania\">share the know-how, giving protest organisers tools and information</a> needed to be effective in what they were doing. So we organised the <strong>Improvised Free Internet Congress</strong>.\n\nAt this point the government already seemed desperate. A single day before the Congress (Friday evening!) we received invitations to a <a href=\"http://mac.gov.pl/bez-kategorii/premier-zawieszam-ratyfikacje-w-sprawie-acta-rozpoczynamy-debate/\">debate with the Prime Minister and ministers</a>, planned for... the following Monday. This might have been a cunning move aimed at not allowing us to respond (media are slow on weekends), or a desperate attempt to relieve the tension as soon as possible. The fact that minister Boni unexpectedly (a single hour in advance) announced his coming to the Congress suggests the latter.\n\nNaturally, one of the main (and of course by far the hardest) tasks at hand at the Congress was formulating an answer to the invitation to the Monday debate. Finally we realised that in light of sending out invitations on Friday evening and taking into account how well over a year of talks about ACTA with the government worked for us, only a single answer was proper: <a href=\"http://www.fwioo.pl/article/210/oswiadczenie-w-sprawie-obywatelskiej-debaty-z-udzialem-prezesa-rady-ministrow/\">decline</a>.\n\nWe decided, however, to take part via electronic means \u2014 especially when we were able to convince the organiser of the debate (Ministry of Administration and Digitalisation) to include, apart from a bit unfortunate choice of Twitter and Facebook (closed, private, corporate networks), also good old standardised <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat\">IRC</a> (a dedicated, moderated channel was set-up on <a href=\"http://telecomix.org/\">Telecomix</a> servers).\n\nThe debate <a href=\"http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7015867\">lasted over 7 hours straight</a> (which, of course, meant a lot of <a href=\"http://blog.sirmacik.net/nareszcie-po-debacie-w-kprm\">comedy-grade material</a>). Nevertheless, it seemed that the government started treating the ACTA topic really seriously.\n\n<h3>PM Tusk admits a mistake</h3>And finally on Friday, the 17th day of February, 2012, Prime Minister Donald Tusk <a href=\"http://rys.io/en/62\">admitted he was wrong</a>. This took us completely by surprise, but curiously the most surprised seemed to be the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage \u2014 as only the day before they sent out a <a href=\"/static/2012-02-16-odpowiedz-mkidn.pdf\">document defending ACTA</a>. They were so surprised, in fact, that they apparently <a href=\"http://www.us.edu.pl/files/wiadomosci/konf/ACTA%20program%20krotki%206.pdf\">cancelled</a> their representative's <a href=\"http://www.us.edu.pl/files/wiadomosci/konf/ACTA%20program%20krotki_1.pdf\">participation</a> in <a href=\"http://www.us.edu.pl/otwarta-debata-w-sprawie-acta\">ACTA debate</a> planned for the following Monday (but announced before PM's decision reversal).\n\n<h3>We have much to discuss</h3>This debate was quite important, as it was the first of the university-organised ACTA debates, postulated by the Ombudsman that took place after PM's change of heart. <strong>Instead of ACTA, then, we debated on copyright reform</strong>.\n\nThis trend continued throughout all university-organised ACTA debates. This way, a bit by luck, a discussion on a dearly-needed copyright reform started in Poland. And this time, the government <a href=\"http://mac.gov.pl/dzialania/postulaty-zebrane-w-czasie-pierwszego-dnia-kongresu-wolnosci-w-internecie/\">appears to take</a> <a href=\"http://pl.wikinews.org/wiki/Kongres_Wolno%C5%9Bci_Internetu_2012:_relacja_z_wydarzenia\">active part</a> in it.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-03-28 00:59:59", "updated_at": "2017-09-13 23:25:25.401478", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2548, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 75.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17031, "user_id": 115, "topic_id": 1767, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<a href=\"http://i-docs.org/\">http://i-docs.org/</a>\n\n", "created_at": "2013-07-05 09:36:52", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:35.094829", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 13, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [14133], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30205, "user_id": 243, "topic_id": 1865, "post_number": 14, "raw": "<b>surprises </b>\n\nits hard to believe but even comments can have bugs...

As a student in the <a href=\"http://futures.hawaii.edu\">Hawaii Futures</a> program, I've had the good fortune to learn the history and see how poor a job most, but apparently not all, folks are at \"predicting\" the future(s) [doubled singular/plural on purpose]. There's been quite a bit of buzz around this lately, which has much to do with this rather bland, and slightly stupifying, piece on \"<a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/3950604a-33bc-11e4-ba62-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3EBO45cZE\">superforecasters</a>\" from FT. However, I'm <em>not</em> in the prediction business, and Foucault aptly begins the quote with \"I'm no prophet.\" Tech forecasting, as Vinay points out, has been the bread-and-butter of foresight for decades, but the other stuff--the messy, but fun, cultural stuff--often gets tossed aside, perhaps for political reasons. Our program resides in the Political Science department, and we're taught early on that the future is (and ought to be) a contentious space, especially given the inequalities and power dynamics of the present. In keeping it open, and radically plural, futurists (at least others that do this) commit to an open politics--driven by aesthetic or aleatory forces. With that said, I tend not to work with corporate clients. I don't want to help certain agents create <em>their</em> future.\n\nThus, I would say that without predication that Futures and/or Foresight becomes the window-making-out-of-walls business (there's that open politics). Opening up possibilities beyond the probable and plausible. Are lots of other folks doing this? Yes. Futurists certainly don't have a monopoly on critical thinking and/or innovative means to enact change, which, in many but not all sectors, is a constant. I say \"many but not all\" as the rich are still rich and the poor are still poor.\n\nAs Nadia points out, Futures tends to be dominated by particular demographics, but there are many amazing futurists voicing local, regional, and global perspectives from around the world. The <a href=\"http://wfsf.org\">WFSF</a> isn't as robust as the <a href=\"http://profuturists.org\">APF</a>, but it has a truly cosmopolitan rank and file.\u00a0\n\nAs an aside, my (now retired) advisor would always tell the story of futurists (<a href=\"http://www.futures.hawaii.edu/about-contact.html\">himself</a> included) from both sides of the Iron Curtain began meeting in the 60's and 70's to figure out a way to prevent armageddon. They often met in (now former) Yugoslavia with \"stout guys wearing dark hats\" in the back of the room.

The same question was also discussed at LOTE3 regarding the development of this website (and lead to the <a href=\"/t/formstorm/348-group/harmonious-hackathons\">Harmonious Hackathons</a> idea).\n\nAt Alberto's post, I proposed that Economy App <em>(edit: since renamed Makerfox)</em> could be an adequate compensation mechanism, and offered to let Edgeryders start using it during the beta phase (and of course, getting the hackers and geeks as beta testers is very attractive for us in return ...). But, is Economy App indeed adequate as a compensation mechanism in this community? We gotta talk.\n\nAlberto <a href=\"/t/should-we-be-working-in-teams-thoughts-after-translating-sams-video/2279/5\">raised this concern</a>:\n\n<em>once tabs are kept, will people stop asking for help to avoid being indebted? Does translating subtitles to Sam's video mean that someone (Sam? Ben? Edgeryders?) now owes the community five thousand euros, or goods for a value thereof? That's a lot of almost-new skateboard tables. You know how time banks fail? Enough people are willing to put in work in return for IOUs in time, but very few are ok signing those IOUs. There is always more supply than demand.</em>\n\n<em>I need to be convinced that putting price tags on quanta of labor is not going to break the workflow. I know you are just using euro as a numeraire, but still.</em>\n\nHere's our take on this:\n\nYes, time banks fail because users like deposits better than debt (it feels more generous, and also more powerful, because it allows immediate spending for desired items). Time banks also fail because of the complementary free rider problem: if too many users get into debt too much and then leave the system, by not offering anything, which renders the deposits of others unredeemable. Or more precisely, time banks fail because people fear this free rider problem and shy away from doing much with time banking for that reason.\n\nThat's why time banks usually say that all members have to commit to keeping their accounts balanced (at zero) as much as possible. Because all credits, and the deposits on the other side, entail the above issues with collectivized trust.\n\nNow, the network barter mechanism in Economy App can be understood as the \"ideal time bank\": every network barter deal enforces this condition of keeping the account balanced, as every involved user will give as much value as she gets. There is no debt, and there is no deposit. It's a barter, just like Harmonious Hackathons are barter (but without using numerical accounting).\n\nSo in the case of the video translation: unMonastery would register an account on Economy App, and add all it offers and needs, as an organization. It would create tasks for the subtitle translations, one per language, and assign a price tag to each. Other Edgeryders with freetime and the desire to explore or try something new would look through tasks and sign up to do those which sound interesting to them (also taking into account the price tag of course). It's important that one user signs up for several tasks to get to do at least one, as that provides the flexibility needed by the barter algorithm. That network barter algorithm then finds an exchange where unMonastery gets one or several translations, and hands out some offers for an equivalent value. While translators hand out the translations, and get something from their order list for an equivalent value. (What might unMonastery offer? Anything that's of use. Free stay for a one-week visit to the unMonastery for example.)\n\nNote that such an exchange between unMonastery and translators is improbable to happen with direct barter (the very fact that limits collaboration right now, as people also tend to avoid debt). As a solution, the algorithm will find any number of people in between to make an indirect barter. Both unMonastery and translators are settled (\"at zero account balance\") before and after the deal: no debt is involved.\n\nI am aware that adding numerical accounting / price tags to goods and services changes the social dynamics of mutual help. That is probably what you worry about. It is most prevalent where debt is involved (as it gets a moral stance then, as David Graeber explains). While without debt being involved, as in network barter, the numerical units can be rather hidden. They only serve the algorithm to calculate which deals are valid. Indeed we should think about hiding the numbers in everything except the \"deal journal\" in Economy App (which is a way for users to check that the platform created valid deals).\n\nDoes that make sense? What other concerns are there that might make Economy App inadequate?\n\n", "created_at": "2013-12-20 16:26:32", "updated_at": "2017-10-02 15:19:47.041117", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 881, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2135, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 2102, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<em>Everyone, this is a wiki with my notes from the session.

However, when I divorced, and later, when I started my thoughts-training-program, and I gradually began to see positive results, I realized what were my most valuable assets. From that moment, I authorized no one to discourage or devalue me.\n\nTOSS ALL TOXIC RELATIONS\n\nYou can kill someone just with words, certain looks. One way to ensure I would preserve and maintain my own self-motivation was to do a vast spring cleaning around me. I systematically removed all toxic relationships that plagued my life.\n\nI did an inventory of what I had, what I wanted to keep, and what I wanted to be released from.\n\nIn order to be able to do this, first, I needed to have an awareness of the self: what activities and beliefs I value, what I expect and need in a friend, and moreover, the negotiable qualities I am willing to accept.\n\nDetermine what was upsetting for me and eating me away was not always easy. Even less to then express my emotions! The day I establish a pattern of honest, self-expression to create boundaries, I becan to toss the toxic out of my life. When I do not communicate assertively, ironically I turn inward and I begin to find fault with myself. I feel guilty about what I should have done or said. When this happens, I lose my power. I do not want that happening to me anymore.\n\nAt one point, I had to have an honest, intimate conversation with myself about my relationships.\n\nNow, I protect myself physically and spiritually. I do not let negative people use me up and erode my self-esteem. I stand up for myself. I allow my real spirit to shine. I stopped pretending to acquiesce to those who constantly ask from me. My soul feels lighter.\n\nFIND THE WOUNDED CHILD\n\nAt our very core, we are love. It is our true nature. What causes someone to spiral down into anxiety, agitation, loneliness or self-judgment is the conditioned mind, the wounded child.\n\nI had to look in the mirror to see what were my own wounds. Self-love, the feeling of being loved and supported by the universe, begins from being deeply loved by parents in a way that fills the child up. Most parents of my generation, and the previous generations, did not know how to do this for their children. The result of that kind of limited-love parenting is that children grew up feeling empty and unloved, lacking self-love and lacking the sense that they are loved.\n\nI learned that it is possible to self-cure the wounded child.\n\nThe book \u00abLes 5 blessures qui emp\u00eachent d'\u00eatre soi-m\u00eame\u00bb (<a href=\"http://leseditionsetc.homestead.com/BLESSURE.html\">http://leseditionsetc.homestead.com/BLESSURE.html</a>) from Lise Bourbeau really helped me to understand my wounds. This book is translated in English (Heal your wounds and find your true self), German, Russian, Italian, Croatian, Spanish, Greek and Turkish.\n\nThe five wounds are: rejection, abandonment, humiliation, betrayal and injustice.\n\nBy the way, we all have wounds! It is impossible for one individual not to have any. We all carry something from our childhood.\n\nRE-IMAGINE YOUR CHILHOOD\n\nAfter my father passed away, in 2009, I went into a totally crazy scrapbooking spree. I scrapbooked hundreds of pictures, 10 to 12 hours a day, for months in a row. I developped at the same time an interest in genealogy. I toured the province to meet all my distant relatives. We looked at their photo albums, and we exchanged some very old family photos. I became a friend of an 80 year old woman. I visited her once a week and enjoyed her talk about childhood memories of my family, while I showed her how to scrapbook. I also bombarded my 90 years old uncle with a ton of questions.\n\nAt the end of this adventure, I had a huge box of scrapbooked pages, covering 15 Robichaud families, dating back several generations. <span><span>I'll</span> <span>leave</span> <span>it all</span> <span>to my son.</span></span>\n\n<img src=\"http://farm2.staticflickr.com/1061/5154432975_d1b1a79a2d.jpg\">\n\n<img src=\"http://farm2.staticflickr.com/1322/5155929364_5805f2860c.jpg\">\n\nI also engraved my name on the family epitaph, at St. Mary Salome village near Joliette, under the name of my father. I did some research to find the grave of my ancestor, Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Robichaud. The village gave me permission to engrave his name on the epitaph.\n\n<img src=\"http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4124/4980316663_590f513e73.jpg\">\n\n<strong>All this helped me to reconcile with my past.</strong>\n\n<span><span>Now that I know</span> <span>where I come from</span><span>, I can walk</span> <span>towards what</span> <span>I want.</span></span>\n\nCREATE A DEEP CONNECTION WITH HIGHER SELF\n\nThere is a great confusion about what is the higher self and what it means in this physical experience. The higher self is the non-physical part of our being, which is not in our body. It is connected to our body through the soul. The higher self has all the knowledge of the humanity, all the memories and much better understanding of who we really are than we do ourselves.\n\nIt is really useful to get to know our higher self because it can guide us when we are unclear about something or it can answer the questions that we are unsure about.\n\nLOVE\n\nLove cannot be true if it changes for any reason. Love is supposed to be constant, through any difficulties. Shakespeare Sonnet 116 (published in 1609) is my favorite. Although Shakespeare's intent was to apply this Sonnet to marriage, I take his description and apply it to my own self-love. I fail to love myself as much as I would like, but it's better than it was.\n\n<em>Love is not love\n\nWhich alters when it alteration finds,\n\nOr bends with the remover to remove:\n\nO no! it is an ever-fixed mark\n\nThat looks on tempests and is never shaken.</em>\n\n", "created_at": "2011-12-19 20:36:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:03.423034", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1156, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [7331], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25201, "user_id": 1450, "topic_id": 3941, "post_number": 8, "raw": "Random generation is fine, surely? The collision likelihood is miniscule (e.g. 8-char random string gives us 62^8 options, which is \u00a02 x 10^14).\n\nUsing from a list means you need to keep track of which numbers have already been used in a document. And just parsing them from the text isn't enough, since some words may have been deleted. If we're going that way it's easier to go back to numeric IDs, and just store the maximum number reached in any piece of content.\n\n--\n\nBut I think we can get away without even bothering with IDs for words. Look back at\u00a0the\u00a0<a href=\"/t/open-ethnographer-software-requirements/3904\">requirements</a>. We're talking about these 2:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><em><strong>Revisions for codings and coded texts.</strong>\u00a0[<span>prepare; implementing can wait</span>] While taking over all codings into the new live version when an edit is done is a good idea, in addition codings should be tied to a revision of the coded text. This is relevant because Open Ethnographer should allow to reproduce the findings of researchers, and for that a defined data version has to exist. This means that the coding progress information has to be stored not per code and text, but as multiple data points per code and revision of text. And when exporting codings, a date-based version has to be chosen, defaulting to the most current one for each code.</em></li>\n\n<li><em><strong>Coding the live version.</strong>\u00a0[<span>optional</span>] This would allow showing the codings even after the coded text got edited after the coding. Without this, codings can only be shown in the version that was coded. This makes sharing the codings difficult, since another researcher could work on a newer version. It also makes reusing the codings for semantic web purposes difficult, since web visitors are always shown the most current version. However, <strong>the effect of these difficulties is low since it barely happens that somebody changes their post (and if so, mostly directly after posting, before the coding happened.)</strong></em></li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThe first, we achieve just by using drupal's revision control, and storing the revision ID with each code. That's a simple addition to either ecomma or annotator. We can also think about exposing the drupal version-compare screen to researchers (latest version on one side, coded version on the other).\n\nThe second task is optional and low impact. We can also probably fudge it later by using some text-alignment algorithm (take the text from the coded revision, search for it in the latest version somewhere near the correct offset).\n\nJust a thought -- you know much more than I do about the requirements here.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-12-01 17:59:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:19.407719", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 535, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [24487], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28552, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2164, "post_number": 11, "raw": "<b>Not a bad idea! </b>\n\nIt is completely experimental: I am not aware anyone has done it this way before.

Why? because it is not a given that the questions asked are the most generative way to finding the answers we are looking for. Discovering new questions, or reframing the ones that exist is very important. As we discovered in ER work with the council of Europe, the questions you DONT ask are sometimes much more fruitfult. If we keep asking the same questions, we get the same answers :)\n\n2) Starting with the questions and asking people to present our/their experiences of the set topics using modified versions of the research questions posed (so they sound like a question you would ask in an informal conversation in the local coffee shop, rather than academic/policy context). Here we need input from the online community builders for each respective country.\n\nVery specific\n\nMaking a Living, Caring for Commons, And We the People are the overaching themes that bind together the differerent questions and topics....they are the umbrellas under which experiences and insights are exchanged, dug deeper into and the hyperloca/national related to the global/international. Why? becausse figuring out how to help one another and people in our communities to make a living, care for commons and have influence in shaping our collective future is something participants fighting for a better future care about. Asking policy related questions for someone else to then maybe act on? Not so much.\n\nConnecting the dots is where individual initiatives/experiences \u00a0and those of the Edgeryders community in a broader sense are related to each other. Why? Simply because we understood that we in our work and lives in this community move back and forth with this split vision...but in policy contexts there is still this outdated silo approach. The big contribution Edgeryders can and does bring to the table, beyond just answering the research questions, is bridging the two very different approaches so they can interact fruitfully. You know, connecting the edges and the centre.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-03-31 16:15:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:58.258643", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 414, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8697, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3717, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Nice!</b>\n\nVery nice!

However, this study shows how by looking at different angles all at once through networks, temporal and semantic analysis we could question different notions of what makes a community, a community through the sole lens of Twitter.\u00a0\n\nNow you're right, if efforts are made beforehand on Twitter, then a lot can easily be achieved IRL at the day of the conference, and we could question if activity on Twitter could predict partly some real-life connection, but also the ultimate purpose these conferences is often to foster these 'active' social contacts.\n\nAs for your map it's a bit too conceptual for the geek that I am, but I would say, if you can categorize the interactions between your peers along with the same categories you are mentioning (and qualify links of your network with them) you should be able to retrace the path you propose.\n\nYou propose to combine even deeper such analysis with many other characterizing relationships (not limited to twitter and/or digital info) and I would completely agree with that, I think this is the future of SNA, and we're right at its edge now. So remember, even if the raw material we used here is rather limited, we only analyse people based on their twitter activity if they were captured by our simple Twitter query (no deep prior knowledge on people or on the event have been used to produce the analysis). Bottomline, we've found groups at the heart of the giant Twitter hairball that seem to be the supporting frame of the whole network here, and we haven't yet tried to cluster the data and analyze each subgroup.\n\nWhat we may want to retain from this analysis, is:\n\n1. -For data scientist like me- how insightful can be a multivariate relational analysis (social, time, semantics...), and how badly we want to correlate observable variables with that.\n\n2. -As a 'real-world' result-\u00a0These 'champions' are more than just individuals (or superstars), together they are a 'champion' network. And this difference is critical I think. That is, by their common action, they are fostering many reactions from the rest of the network. Each individual could have they own 'followers' but themselves, they are the seeds who can gather even more individuals, and bring long lasting support for the community to exist as is. Anyone that would be picked and included in this core network (not just one individual, but interacting with a few in this subgroup), would become a new member of the community, and may in turn become another core member.\n\nWell, I think this confirms your last point! Thanks for the tip on the ecology lens, I'll give it a shot. \u00a0As for clusters, well it's another very long discussion, I try to limit it as much as possible as their is no perfect clustering algorithm, and the definition of the boundaries of what forms a cluster always need to be discussed. Of course, we always need clustering with large data that we can't untangle at once... but again, that's a different discussion!\n\nThanks a lot again,\n\n(<em>19-05-2015\u00a0edit: typos</em>)\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-18 09:24:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:54.732677", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 629, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2551], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12834, "user_id": 100, "topic_id": 1349, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>A Deeper Level</b>\n\nOh, Lyne, voici quelque chose non pas d'inattendu mais tr\u00e8s courageux de ta part car peu de gens acceptent de se poser la question de la refondation de l'humain \u00e0 part Ray Kurzweil\u00a0http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil \u00a0et son projet de transhumanisme\u00a0http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism\n\nJe te soutiens.

The Policy Hero Challenge is an event brought to you by the Edgeryders community. It offers an environment in which a diverse group of civil servants, citizens and policymakers can engage in constructive discussions and collaborate to produce concrete, pragmatic and fully vetted policy measures. The broad <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/116463853/DRAFT-The-Edgeryders-Guide-to-the-Future-A-handbook-for-policymakers-and-managers-of-policy-oriented-online-communities\">policy recommendations </a>are devised on the basis of data and insights generated through Edgeryders, a distributed think tank advising European and national institutions on policy reform. It explores how young, and not so young Europeans are navigating their transition to active adult lives in the most challenging socio-economic climate in decades. Participants are self-selected, join without permission and coordinate through an online platform built on free software.\n\nTo date the Edgeryders community has over 1500 members (and growing) from over 40 countries in a nurturing environment where individuals come together to inspire one another, learn from one another and help one another. In 2012 The online conversation on Edgeryders was integrated with an offline event, the Living on the Edge conference, which took place in in on June 14-17 and drew over 200 citizens and policymakers from all over Europe: the about 5,000 entries offered by citizens through the platform were taken on board and enriched by a team of researchers. This process has singled out a number of areas for improvement. With the Policy Hero Challenge, we aim to turn each one into an actionable: a course of action that policy maker can feasibly take to produce positive change in that area.\n\nThe Policy Hero Challenge does not end with the event. Following \\#lote3, members of the Edgeryders community, with the help of partner institutions, will engage more people in fleshing out the policy measures that come out of the Policy Hero Challenge. As well as attempt to build a network of insitutional actors who are willing to explore the possibility of adopting the policy measures. The Policy Hero Challenge team behind the most widely adopted policy measures will be awarded the Edgeryders Policy Heros Prize at a widely publicised ceremony to take place at the Living on the Edge Event scheduled for September 2013.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/OKFNitaly/status/280984039563857920\n\nhttps://twitter.com/RoryJHSmith/status/277065482161487872\n\n<script charset=\"utf-8\" type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script>\n\n<span>We tested the first iteration of the process at the second Living on the Edge event, \\#lote2, in Brussels in early december 2012. </span><span>Before picking up where we left off with the Policy Hero Challenge in December it would be great to pick up some of the impressions of people who participated.

We run an instantiation of STF in Italy; we try to make the changemakers at the edge emerge, and through them we try to make sense of what kind of future people are building.</li>\n\n<li>we try to engineer some kind of activity around the unMonastery. For example, Elf and Cristiano are doing really interesting \u00a0work, documenting closely consumption patterns (for example, we know that 65% of the food consumed by unMonasterians is locally produced; they weigh waste divided by fraction \u2013 so many kilos of wine bottles, so many kilos of non-wine bottles, so many kilos of compost etc.). Another thing that would be needed is an evaluation activity of the unMonastery. New voices, check; new format, check; stakeholders, check, as this is a horizontal project on a territory; but of course Telcos are viewed with a lot of suspicion. We would need something to do together, and that brings me to...\u00a0</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SykJcdYGPDo54_Ir3X8B_O7dfvrFNWjEkPhJl2F4g1g/edit#heading=h.auoprorgdbtw\">this</a>. We wrote this downstream of a meeting with Fabrizio Barca (!), who visited the unMonastery and asked for a proposal. New voices, check; stakeholders, check; new format, not so much, because this <em>is</em> a conference. But if we make it in the unMonastery is going to be very... uncorporate.</li>\n\n<li>picking a project from the community and scaling it. For example <a href=\"/makerfox\">Makerfox</a> (network barter to restart liquidity constrained economies \u2013 this project won last year's European Social Innovation Competition); or the <a href=\"/t/the-viral-academy/358\">Viral Academy</a>\u00a0(teaching people to code, with the twist that students, in order to complete the course, need to trach other students \u2013 also seed funded by the Nominet Trust in the UK and looking for opportunites to scale); or Moove (peer-to-peer coaching app for young job seekers). There are many more.</li>\n\n<li>Maybe the most interesting things of all is this: they could support... Edgeryders, with you as project manager! The job would be to help digital innovation to spill over to the social level. This is what we do anyway. We do it by means of a global online community, that empowers individuals wanting to do relevant stuff through peer-to-peer support. This could be done by creating a Telecom-branded interface to Edgeryders: we would man this and guarantee that people that come into contact with the program get peer-to-peer access to the whole Edgeryders community. It could get quite sophisticated, because in a matter of a few months we are deploying Makerfox on top of Edgeryders \u2013 we will be the first community to test it. This means we can support projects in various ways (voluntary work against \"thank you vouchers\", deferred paid work, time-bank style, contingent paid work etc.), and have some kind of accounting device for the collaboration. We hope that, in this way, people will collaborate more. Matthias and I explored the theme some time ago in <a href=\"/t/can-makerfox-help-edgeryders-to-collaborate/2283\">this thread</a>, and finally agreed to deploy Makerfox on top of Egderyders and test it. The main idea here is to \"turn work into capital\" for young people who have no money but plenty of time and skills. I guess this is the evolution of an older project called <a href=\"/t/social-capital-for-social-ventures/314\">Social Capital 4 Social Venture</a>.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nWhat do you think?\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-03-20 10:15:16", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:43.507713", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 625, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23327, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4443, "post_number": 28, "raw": "<b>I know!</b>\n\nI know you mean well, <a href=\"/u/kei\">@Kei</a>. But you execute badly. If you want people to stay within line of sight of each other, you make their comms simple: in my view, you have already broken unMonastery's comms by fragmenting it across, let's see: the original project here on Edgeryders, two Wordpress websites, a Google Group, a Facebook group, a wiki, Slack, Medium, Discourse. I am supposed to be one of the initiators of the project, but I have completely lost sight of what's happening in that space.\n\nAnd yes, you can participate to many projects at one, and you are definitely welcome to participate to Edgeryders, but when you are here you will need to accept its rules. The main one is Who Does The Work Calls The Shots: you don't like what I do, do it better. Or help me. Or do something different. A modicum of critique is welcome, of course. But at the end of the day, any minute spent in having these exhausting discussions is a minute not spent in doing stuff I am better at and enjoy more, like supporting some of the great people out there.\n\nJust to clarify how hard we worked last year: I have only incomplete records (working on it, but it will take time!), but what I am seeing for 2014 is this: Edgeryders LBG paid out \u20ac 50,588 to directors against work done in projects; \u20ac 38,607 to non-directors against participation in projects (excluding the unMonastery); \u20ac 25,650 in the unMonastery (comprehensive of stipends + costs); and \u20ac 9,371 against travel to LOTE4. That's \u20ac 98,566 paid out to the community. Not for nothing \u2013 everyone contributed. But only five of us made the sales, funded the platform and did the business development, admin and accounting work.\n\nSo: five people secured 100% of the revenue of ER LBG, but appropriated only about one third of the benefits.\n\nI think maybe this could grow a little, but it needs attention. And discussions like this are using it up \u2013 very badly, in my opinion.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-23 16:56:02", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:09.560845", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 372, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 6.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [23325], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20400, "user_id": 2278, "topic_id": 3710, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Thanks for the comments!!</b>\n\n\u00a0Hi all, I hope you will enjoy the video as well! so we are gonna upload the rough version tonight, it will still miss some fine adjustments like better equalization of the sound, fine color correction on the cover images, some cover images here and there to fulfill the speech, various titles and logos, on this matter could you please forward them to us in hi resolution? \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThanks\n\n", "created_at": "2014-09-29 17:58:50", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:53.569994", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 81, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4639, "user_id": 2566, "topic_id": 4606, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">ezelab</h2>\n\n<em>Early this year the ezelab team bought a large aluminium block, the main building block of a self-built CNC router, a computer controlled woodworking tool.\u00a0</em>\n\n<em>After a long search, he sourced one in El-Sabteya, Cairo\u2019s largest scrap iron market.

The ezelab office is a basement in Mansoura\u2019s toreel district, a street away from city hall. We descend the stairs to the basement, which consists of 2 sections: The office with 2 desks each lined up with 2 computer monitors and a larger working table. A door separates the office from the much larger workshop which houses woodcutting machines and a CNC router, a computer controlled woodworking tool. The floor is filled with wood prototypes and unprocessed input materials. \u00a0</em>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>What is ezelab? Where is the Mansoura Fab Lab?</strong>\n\nWe are currently in transition period, where we want to move to a new larger space. We are leaving this basement by August, and as soon as we settle in we will launch the Mansoura Fabrication Lab. All the ingredients are there already: We have a complete set of tools, ranging from the smallest screwdrivers, chip soldiering equipment up to our 2 meter wide CNC router.\u00a0\n\nThe Mansoura Fab Lab will be incorporated as a new business intended to be a for-profit company. Currently, we are operating under the ezelab brand and legal structure. Ezelab is a Sole proprietorship registered by Kareem. He started it years ago selling commercial software.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>What products does ezelab currently produce?\u00a0</strong>\n\nSo far we have only marketed and sold the EZE VR, a virtual reality cardboard kit which is based on the Google Cardboard. It is a DIY kit where you create your own virtual reality headset using your smartphone.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/8/8fabf65b72ae0bb6ca8ba535b4cc6bd338e234b3.jpg\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\n\u00a0\n\nEzelab also built a digital water fountain, a computer controlled water plotter wall that displays graphics, patterns and texts. Water drops fall down and serve as pixels, and so create a graphical waterfall that scrolls downwards continuously. Currently, we are developing an updated version of our fountain, which we will market under the EZE AQUA name.\u00a0\n\nFinally, we are planning to launch the Fabrication lab, where we will design and build custom made designs and computer controlled objects.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>How did all this start?</strong>\n\n<em>Kareem Nagy stumbled on the idea of a digital water fountain on the Internet in 2009. He was struck by it, and contacted the Japanese manufacture for a quote. The Japanese responded with an extravagant cost, so Kareem decided to pursue its construction singlehandedly. Relying on the Internet, Kareem downloaded designs and understood the basic mechanics behind digital water fountains and started building his own. It took Kareem 2 years until he had a working prototype.\u00a0</em>\n\n<em>In 2011, Kareem first met Ahmed Hashish, whom he had hired to photograph his now finished digital water fountain professionally. Ahmed was particularly awestruck with a CNC router Kareem had built, with the purpose of custom building parts he could not source within Cairo\u2019s bustling markets. Such as a control board for the water plotter. Ahmed was awestruck with Kareem\u2019s hacker-ethos.\u00a0</em>\n\n<em>Prior to meeting Kareem, Ahmed had worked in a forward-looking bookshop in Mansoura called Box n\u2019Beans, where he often had conversations with Mu'taz Mutawea about the environment and urbanism. Ahmed resonated with Mu\u2019taz\u2019s theories about how Mansouras small size and physical proximity of everything was more conducive for productive communities to develop. He arranged for Mu\u2019taz to meet Kareem, and soon after the three decided to work together.\u00a0</em>\n\n\u00a0\n\nAhmed: From here on everything started progressing quickly. We all met together in April 2014 and started discussing the possibility of creating a creative space in Mansoura. By October 2014 we started operations under the existing ezelab brand. With operations I mean sourcing, assembling and selling the EZE VR, building our new large CNC router and general preparations for the Mansoura Fabrication Lab.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>What is the thought process behind Mansoura Fabrication Lab? What is your objective?</strong>\n\nLook at Egypt and you will find a net importer of goods with all it entails. We have a problem in that we rely too much on trade and are too dependent on foreign currencies: The exchange rate deteriorated by 40% since the revolution in 2011. Still, importers have to find foreign currency in the first place and are subject to supply constraints. The black market commands even higher premiums. Arbitrary executive orders and customs procedures add to the hassle of imports. I reject this dependancy on factors outside of my own individual agency, and believe in manufacturing locally. Another problem I see in Egypt is the mentality of traders concerned only with finishing the sale and the quick buck, where quality concerns and the value proposition are often ignored.\u00a0\n\nPersonally, I was planning on emigrating Egypt for Australia around 2009. I changed my mind due to the revolution and took a decision to stay. Simply taking up on some office job or the family trade would not have been fulfilling, I reject these engrained hierarchies. Since we are forced to find a way to adapt to local conditions we stumbled upon the idea of a Fab lab. It is not some sort of charity or place for common good, but rather an active decision in our long-term goal of being sustainable and scaling up in size.\u00a0\n\nOur core philosophy is building our own tools and independence. The EZE VR is sourced locally as much as possible. The EZE AQUA relies on a components a self-designed electrical control board and on parts carved by our own CNC router. The CNC router in turn we built ourselves, as we needed it to be a specific size to be able to supply the required EZE AQUA parts. The Fabrication Lab will support our long term shift to building more complex and specialised objects\n\nIndependence from exchange rate constraints, arbitrary regulation, undeserving suppliers and funding limitations is a core tenet. We strongly reject companies and initiatives that are dependant on finite donor funds.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>What, other than money, could help you in your work?\u00a0</strong>\n\nSharing Knowledge is very important. Everything we do is based on knowledge share by others: The cardboard design open-sourced by Google, the design manuals for the digital water fountain etc.. Even more important is integrity in sharing that knowledge: Particularly in marketplaces tips are often misleading. Some traders purposefully send you on false trails or to subpar places. I\u2019d rather not know then learn something wrong.\u00a0\n\nAccess to self-motivated people to hire is equally important! Teamwork and collaboration are very important traits to have and learn.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>How do you fund your work?</strong>\n\nWe are entirely self-funded so far, bootstrapping our way towards maturity. We have invested a combined 300K EGP, primarily in equipment and input materials. Wh anticipate rent for wherever we move to next to play an important role in costs as well. So far, sales from the EZE VR kit are our main income source and have covered a part of our operating expenses. We have sold 1600 pieces at 45 EGP a pop.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>How did you build the EZE VR?</strong>\n\nThe EZE VR is built and assembled in Egypt. It consists of a cardboard construct, two lenses, two magnets and miscellaneous components holding everything together. The cardboard, its cutting and printing is done at a local printshop here in Mansoura. We import the magnets and lenses from China, as we couldn\u2019t source high quality components locally. Then, we hired three of our friends from university to help us with assembly.\u00a0\n\nWe follow the open source specifications and design published by Google religiously, and are the most competitive offering. The EZE VR is 40% cheaper than the cheapest Chinese import, and is of a quality level more common to VR kits more than twice the cost!\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>Who are your competitors? What alternatives exist?</strong>\n\nWe are the only ones producing Virtual reality kits in Egypt, everything else on the market are Chinese imports. When we start marketing the digital water fountain, we will be the first to market and the only ones manufacturing in Egypt.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere are equivalent Fabrication Labs in Cairo and Alexandria. We will be the first Fabrication Lab elsewhere, and the only one for now. In fact, for Mansoura, we will be unique in offering a space open to the public in this way. We believe that our Fabrication lab, once opened to the public, will take on the roles of a Hacker-space and co-working space as well, as none exist in Mansoura yet.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>Do you engage with the wider community?</strong>\n\nSo far not. We have barely done any marketing for the EZE VR, nor discussed the upcoming Fabrication lab with people. For once, there is no relevant community in Mansoura, which leaves us with engaging with Cairo and Alexandria. We kept this at a minimum, as we prefer to launch first and talk later. I come from an art background, where community engagement and marketing are exaggerated even before many initiatives launch; where most talk is hot air.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-08-08 22:00:00", "updated_at": "2017-09-06 07:08:08.101991", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1903, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 270.6, "like_count": 7, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856, 2565, 5, 3729, 3782, 4085, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33026, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2888, "post_number": 32, "raw": "<b>No argument</b>\n\nEverything is clear and documented, as far as I am concerned.

We participate through being consumers, supporting the economy, circulating money while trying to provide valuable livelihoods for ourselves and others. We participate through generosity, giving or sharing what we can spare and volunteering to help others, both at home and abroad.\n\nMany of us choose to get involved in social governance. We may take on formal roles and responsibilities, become school governors, stand as a local councillor, act on committees and community forums. And, of course, we can vote. Less formally, we may also get involved in public consultations and - when we feel our concerns have not been sufficiently listened to \u2013 we can challenge decisions more directly through campaigning and protesting. So, with so many opportunities to participate, why are we seeing people engaging in their communities in new, more collaborative ways, and what can we learn from this?\n\nAn example of these new creative behaviours might broadly be described in this simple scenario: a person has an idea of how their street or community might look or feel different. They might think that a few benches in their street would create new opportunities for neighbours to get to know one another better through informal contact. Historically, they could take their idea to the local authority or their ward councillor, where it would be supported or not.\n\nBut if that person knocked on their neighbours\u2019 doors, described their idea and managed to collect some donations and, together, they bought a bench or two - or even designed and made their own, then this would be a significantly different approach. They would not be acting out of charity, or representing anyone, or campaigning. They had a creative, socially informed idea and, working collaboratively with neighbours, they made it happen.\n\nFor some years, I have been working on a project called Social Spaces, concentrating on understanding these phenomena as they have emerged. Working with Laura Billings and Maurice Specht we now have 50 (and growing) collaborative books in production by brilliant voluntary editors.\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.shareable.net/blog/the-community-lovers-guide-to-the-universe\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Community Lover\u2019s Guide to the Universe</em></a>\u00a0is collecting stories about these new types of local projects from around the world, projects often characterized by their powerful ability to gently bridge social divides and encourage co-operation and creativity.\n\nOver the past 18 months,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.socialspaces.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Social Spaces</a>\u00a0has worked in around 80 communities, asking over 2,000 people what they would like to see more of in the places where they live. We have worked in all types of communities, including less privileged places, and the answers are the same everywhere. Not a single person has asked for more restaurants, clothing or jewellery shops. Instead, people in the UK said they want to live in communities where the divisions between age, culture, wealth (and lack of it) are bridged. They told us that they want to live in beautiful places and, very importantly, that they want new types of common space, places that can help to build more sociable communities. They want to create a sense of community, to pool their ideas, talents and to build on their innate resourcefulness and resilience through simple activities.\n\nThey believe that these activities, added together, can start to make significant steps towards transforming their communities. Research confirms this. What has emerged from this work is an amazing collective vision: a homemade vision that is not being imposed by social theorists, the media or Hollywood.\n\n<div>\n\n<object height=\"80px\" width=\"80px\">\n\n<embed allowfullscreen=\"true\" flashvars=\"mode=mini&amp;viewMode=singlePage&amp;backgroundColor=%23222222&amp;documentId=120523165235-36c695d7eed54137a382a9b393c04673\" height=\"80px\" menu=\"false\" src=\"http://static.issuu.com/webembed/viewers/style1/v2/IssuuReader.swf\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"80px\" wmode=\"transparent\"></embed></object><div>\n\n<a href=\"http://issuu.com/socialspaces/docs/pp_-_new_green?mode=window&amp;viewMode=singlePage&amp;backgroundColor=%23222222\" target=\"_blank\">Open publication</a>Thinking about <a href=\"http://issuu.com/socialspaces/docs/pp_-_new_green\">Creative/Collaborative</a> as a new paradigm isn\u2019t an utopian philosopher\u2019s dream either \u2013 as we are seeing it is a narrative being told by grassroots community projects popping up around the world.\u00a0 These are the people that are teaching us about how to create projects and ideas that connect communities in new and productive ways. \u00a0When analysed these projects aren\u2019t \u2018representative\u2019, \u2018charitable\u2019, \u2018consumer\u2019 or \u2018challenge\u2019. So you could define Creative/Collaborative firstly by what it isn't i.e. we see activity that doesn't fit the other four mature paradigms, and secondly by the two strongest characteristics demonstrated i.e. Creative: they connect many new and existing resources and ideas to make entirely new things, and Collaboratively: they boost the potential and success of the work by collective and collaborative ways of operating.\n\nThis same pattern is emerging around the world, from community fruit collections and skills sessions, to resource sharing and many projects relating to food, growing, cooking, making and learning. What we are seeing is not nostalgic and is culturally and structurally very different from what we have witnessed before.\n\nKnowledge about systems, the social connection needs of people, the ideas and methods of making these social projects work, is slowly becoming more widespread, making these innovative projects more sophisticated in their design. Some professionals are deploying their expertise in their own communities voluntarily. There is a much deeper and wider appreciation of the idea of waste; whether of people\u2019s talents, ideas and energies, or physical resources. Collectively, these strands of thinking represent opportunities to act in clever and successful ways that have the potential to transform how we live day-to-day.\n\nPeople are rediscovering the pleasures and benefits of common activity: neither as passive consumers, nor as needy recipients of charity, but as active makers and designers of the social, economic and physical infrastructure of where they live. There is a new sense of agency emerging, of optimism and of control, and it is revealing itself through positive activity on a human scale.\n\nSo what impact could this new type of creative and collaborative participation have and why is it so important? Three important questions:\n\n<ol style=\"padding-right: 40px; \">\n\n<li>Is it important that local politicians support this work and how do they stay relevant?</li>\n\n<li>How can we build sufficient density of this type of participation to fight intolerance and oppression while boosting our social, economic and environmental resilience?</li>\n\n<li>How can we invent more clever combinations of these participatory paradigms to successfully integrate our essential material needs and our innate social desires for harmony and wellbeing?</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nIf you have some thoughts on these questions I would love to hear them!\n\n<em>Tessy Britton is Director of\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.socialspaces.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Social Spaces</a>\u00a0- a project working to develop new knowledge about innovative community-led projects and has been collaborating with\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.architecture00.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Zero Zero</a>\u00a0to develop\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.architecture00.net/\" target=\"_blank\">The Civic Crowd</a>, a civic project mapping and initiative development platform.</em>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-23 19:56:26", "updated_at": "2017-09-13 08:18:54.306203", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1403, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 15.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1664, "user_id": 264, "topic_id": 1631, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"imagecache-Featured\" src=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/sites/edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/files/imagecache/Featured/solobass.jpg\" title=\"\">\n\nI met Steve Lawson AKA <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/solobasssteve\">SoloBassSteve</a> at an Amplified event when I was investigating new formats for Citilab. He was so enthusiastic about everything it made me sick ;-) Later he was part of an Amplified team that came to work their magic on PodCamp Barcelona, and I saw his great skills at close hand. He and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/documentally\">@Documentally</a> have been two of my biggest influences on the use of social media to, well, amplify things.\n\n(btw the video failed in the recording so I've replaced it with footage of Steve playing music - \"the soundtrack to the day you wish you'd had\", as he puts it. Make sure you watch/listen to the video - there's so much more detail in it as there is with all the videos in this series ;-) )\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/yxY-t6C_0YI?rel=0\n\n<a href=\"http://www.stevelawson.net/\">Steve</a> is ostensibly a musician, although he says his way or making a living is more a\u00a0 portfolio thing. \"I get paid to be curious\", he says. adding that the musician bit is integral, the centre of the wheel.\n\nHe had a conventional music career after college - playing music with other people, doing tv, radio and theatre. At end of the 1990's he played a solo show, recorded it &amp; put it on his website - \"people asked \"when is the album coming out?\"\" At the time he was a music journalist and knew there was no money in recording a solo album as a bass playing instrumentalist, people who did it, did it as a loss-leader. Steve realised that making records was cheap and somebody was siphoning off lots of money, so he recorded his first album on a mini-disc. It sold and broke even very quickly and then started to make money. The conversation he was having with his audience made him think there was a sustainable way of making music outside of the mainstream music biz.\n\nSustainability became the key, he says . Musicians are normally told that they are not quite big enough yet, but doing it himself meant that nobody was telling him what success looked like. People started contacting him about gigs and he did a lot of the booking himself because he knew from being online that there were people in certain areas who would show up to concert and that 15 people paying 10 pounds each is 150 pounds,\u00a0 the same as he would get for playing at Shepherd's Bush Empire. The industry was always more about making \"someone\" lots of money rather than you being able to live but he was discovering that he could make a living. He points out that he was lucky to be in his late 20's and not a teenager or he might have succumbed to typical idea of success.\n\nStere had an emerging portfolio career. He had a great network of people he'd met through being a journalist. Also he was teaching so he had a profile as a teacher and a writer about music education and it became apparent that the aim was not to be a \"full time musician\". Plus it was more stable as a lot of the tech industry collapsed around turn of the century and a lot of people were out of work. Because he could switch between teaching, writing &amp; playing, he only needed one thing to be paying the bills at any time.\n\n<strong>Music \"Biz\"</strong>\n\nAlthough he was worried about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster\">Napster</a> at the beginning and didn't use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_Torrent\">BitTorrent</a>, the more the industry complained about these things, the more he thought they must be good if they hated them so much. Due to their history of never supporting artists, being monopolistic, abusive - a protection racket more than anything else, if they said it was their destroying their business model, Steve thought there must be something in it. As technology spread, more people were finding his work because he was visible online and he began inviting people to download his music and pay what they wanted for it. In part this worked because the industry was treating downloads as if they were cd's and they were priced as if a physical object was created. This then became another story - there was the story of the music and the story of the access to the music and it functioned as marketing used to.\n\nIt also enabled the musicians to be able to talk about their own sense of gratitude that people listened as in the past the it was considered a bad thing if someone wanted to listen to you unless they paid. All of this happened off the way social media enabled musicians to talk to their listeners. Steve was using his website as a social media forum before social media was known and when Twitter came along he moved over and his community moved with him. He became a kind of music conduit within the community, becoming a fulcrum around which music makers and listeners discovered each other and music makers discovered that they were also music listeners too. He can generate sales of other music by his recommendations and thinks that in the near future this will be the main way people discover music. Steve mentions that he took his music off Spotify for many reasons around their model and cites <a href=\"http://music.stevelawson.net/\">Bandcamp</a> as much more creator friendly.\n\n<strong>Amplifying the conversation</strong>\n\nAlthough he stopped being a journalist, Steve continues to write mainly as part of <a href=\"http://www.amplified10.com/\">Amplified</a> - a social media facilitation project which developed from the <a href=\"http://tuttleclub.wordpress.com/\">Tuttle club</a> in London, where a group of geeks who liked social media got together weekly to discuss what that meant for art, politics, education, business etc. Los of events were taking place but the sole outcome from them was the guy on the platform talking. But the interesting stuff was people talking over coffee, so they came up with a system for documenting that, of shaping events around that other kind of output. It became a key thing, allowing Steve to solidify his thoughts about how social media works and the necessity of having a multiplicity of voices. This tied in with a widening of access to the tools of dissemination and creates situations where you have a brilliantly diverse culture of people making small scale contributions to what is going on, but when summed together is really important. \"We were hoodwinked for the latter half of the 20th Century, with the lie that the only thing that mattered was numerical success - as musicians, in the media, in organisations, and we lost the ability to think with any integrity about what we were doing and do it because it was important, not because it was successful\". The Internet allows us to reverse that and to find other small groups of people who are challenging the same issues he says.\n\nIt meant that in terms of making a living, as what could be broadly thought of as a social technology consultant, Steve was able to work on lots of little projects and make a living, rather than trying to make big money. Big money consultation for government tends to mean that the government doesn't invest in ongoing work - they feel they've had their 1 day consultation with an expert, they've spent their budget on that and then continue to act as before, he explains. Steve was more interested in spending weeks at an organisation and completely changing the culture of how they use the Internet, rethinking transparency and opening up the sense of their core message to users, constituents and stakeholders.\n\nTo be part of a counter-culture to the entrenched positions and power structures doesn't have to mean marching in Whitehall, being part of modelling a different way of doing things is really important, and to be able to do that and make enough to pay the bills most months is a good thing, Steve says.\n\n<strong>Myths &amp; Power</strong>\n\nThe power of the late 20th Century success myth of Hollywood and the record industry gives these players incredible power in debates about Internet legislation. History is written by the winners so the account of what the record industry has meant to the world in the last 60 years has been written by the record industry, not by the millions of people who have been failed by it, Steve points out. So they show twisted statistics of what they made before and what they make now and say it's all because of the Internet. But people are choosing other forms of physical entertainment media - games, DVD box sets etc meaning that music has lost out to other forms which look like better value. Also games and box sets are full of licensed music which they never talk about.\u00a0\n\nThe sales peak in the late 1990's was people replacing their vinyl and cassette collections on CD, and a vast amount of money in the industry is about archive recordings. Outside of the official figures there is also a secondary economy of people like Steve whose sales are not registered by \"official\" bodies. The other thing the industry ignore is that the cost of making records is a tenth of what it was for the equivalent quality 20 years ago. Art making doesn't have to be speculative.\n\nThe record industry has an enormous amount of money for lobbying, and Steve remembers that MP Tom Watson said he'd never seen more money spent on a lobby than that around the UK's Digital Economy Act. Leaked memos showed the extent of their manoeuvres. \"The big problem legislatively,\" Steve says, \"is that they do start to influence laws to make it impossible to do what we do. They don't want a level playing field.\"\n\n<strong>Mining, scraping &amp; ecosystems</strong>\n\nSteve has a big problem with the model of Internet services that are provided for free while mining and scraping data and selling it to governments and advertisers. He would prefer to pay for services, thereby having services which provide meaningful conversation instead of having models based on data sale. Those services would then be more focused on, and useful to the user. If the selling of data is the business, and many users find it unacceptable, these companies will be become more pernicious, hiding what they are doing. He hates the fact that services surround his music with advertising and that makes it viable for him to make music - \"I'd prefer a position where people can pay for the music they like, not pay for the music they don't like, share it, be part of an economy or an ecosystem that wasn't just about paying or not paying.\"\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-05 09:46:46", "updated_at": "2017-08-28 18:10:00.510906", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1975, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9987, "user_id": 1935, "topic_id": 2959, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>done</b>\n\nonly one missing , waiting for a final edit from participants . if not will post it tonight\n\n", "created_at": "2014-05-10 11:18:43", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:57.755444", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 21, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28004, "user_id": 82, "topic_id": 2117, "post_number": 8, "raw": "Sweet!

Project stewards are empowered to extend trust to further project goals with participants of suitable capacity (skill set or experience). Accountabilities are specific task sets that are prioritized by stewards for project fulfillment, and then effectively crowdsourced.\u00a0\n\nThis level of nuance (and complexity) is where a modeling environment like Metamaps can shine, revealing the changing state of relationships and activities in a given project space, where things like methods, collaborators, outcomes, and feedback are all visible and meaningfully connected.\n\nI'm going to keep buliding and sharing some such maps to see how others may find them useful too!\u00a0\n\nThe first three \"Issues\" raised by Ben in the original post above seem to me\u00a0the crux of the matter, plus perhaps a related area of <em>Recognitions</em>\u00a0and rewards for contributions\u00a0well made (in line with shared value propositions). The most obvious challenge may\u00a0be synchronization between various records, intentions, and perspectives in play at any given time under the project banners. This, I think, is the first order of business for coherence holders to take on and resolve, so that it is clear enough where and how to engage for\u00a0a baseline livel of concurrency (knowing that your are 'on the same page' with most others in the project space at any time) and co-creation.\u00a0\n\nWith well-crafted goals and values out in the open (a map!), it is much easier to break down tasks and enlist volunteers, with the possibility of thoughtful rewards/acknowledgement\u00a0based on demonstrated achievement in line with overarching project goals. These goals can\u00a0reside at\u00a0an intersection of multiple projects or networks.\n\nBreaking goals down into accountabilities (something of a project roadmap) helps people to self-select (and constantly adjust) for right placement within the emerging social organism.\n\nThere is a center or hub\u00a0for the project which maintains this overview picture and coordination, but it is open to forking or parallel processing to help deliver increased value to support/user communities, the ultimate arbiters of currency.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-08-18 04:21:41", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:34.506538", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 496, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5806, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5773, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/c/cbd02fe9b82d626a0c8bd3d1301c2bf45d52fdba.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"470\">\n\n<strong>\"Yes, but this solution does not scale!\"</strong>\u00a0The venture capitalist is not happy with you.

We have\u00a0<em>hundreds</em>\u00a0of these stories, and we are sure there are thousands more out there.\u00a0These initiatives are so effective because they cleverly deploy local resources: skills, mutual trust, capital, institutions, focusing on the here and now.\u00a0This is the source of their\u00a0edge, and they would be well advised not to lose it: they should attempt to scale as far as these resources extend, but not more.\n\nAre global solutions impossible? Not at all. But\u00a0<strong>global solutions are\u00a0not composed of standardised identical units; they are\u00a0<em>ecosystems,</em>\u00a0organic mosaics of local solutions</strong>. For example, nature has a robust global solution to growing forests. It is not a single very large tree that covers 30% of the planet's surface. It is not a single species of tree cloned in tens of billions of units across the whole globe. It is\u00a0<em>diversity:</em>\u00a0local adaptation, commensalism, some competition. A forest on the Mediterranean coast occupies the same ecological niche as one in Siberia, but the two consist\u00a0of entirely different species, and are\u00a0very different\u00a0along almost any other dimension. Nature gets there by evolution: try many things, more or less at random (variation); then weed out those who do not work (natural selection); iterate.\n\n<strong>This makes a ton of sense, except for one important\u00a0detail:\u00a0<em>funding</em>\u00a0is centralised</strong>. For several reasons, organisations that make it their mission to support social innovators much prefer to issue large, strictly regulated grants than small no-strings-attached bit of cash to people wanting to rapid-test stuff. So, there is not enough variation.\u00a0Large grant-receiving projects\u00a0are never allowed to declare failure (can recipients afford honesty, when honesty means you are going out of business?),\u00a0so there is not enough natural selection either. We are stuck with local-and-efficient grassroots initiatives that donors won't touch, and large-and-bureaucratic cookie-cutter solutions that won't work.\n\n<strong>Unless we can hack funding,</strong>\n\nSo we are trying just that. We have fallen in love with\u00a0<a data-mce-href=\"https://www.100andchange.org/\" href=\"https://www.100andchange.org/\">100&amp;Change</a>, an ambitious program dreamed up by the MacArthur Foundation. Name a big, hairy problem; come up with a credible solution; 100&amp;Change will fund you up to a hundred\u00a0million dollars to implement it. The openness, the flexibility, the two-stage process where you are mentored into hardening your solution:\u00a0everything in it is perfect for the brilliant social innovators we meet everyday through Edgeryders, except that none can process a hundred\u00a0million dollars without ditching everything they have built and starting from scratch \u2013 and why would you do that, with things that work?\n\nHere is what we do: we have selected a big problem,\u00a0<strong>sustainable and inclusive provision of health and social care</strong>. We have selected a candidate solution, cast\u00a0<em><strong>communities\u00a0</strong></em><strong>(instead of, or in addition to, the state or private business) as care\u00a0providers</strong>.\u00a0<strong>We will submit an application, not as a large organisation but as a \"smart swarm\" of small ones</strong>. We will promise to go about solving the problem like nature does: try many things at once, share knowledge and copy as much as possible from each other. The result will be something like forests: a patchwork of locally optimal solutions, loosely coordinated.\n\nTo do this, we need to radically open up the application process: while other applicants will work under NDAs in their offices, we in the Care Swarm will use online documents and offline meetings where everyone is welcome. We will win, because there are many more of us than there are in any of those offices, and we are better connected to each other. We have more raw brainpower. We are better at sharing knowledge, because in our peer-to-peer culture more of us are teachers.

So if people need shelter and buildings have fallen, maybe we can build hexayurts. Or if hospitals need sterilization and there's no electricity, then boil the knives.

But major challenges was of organized data and availability of resources to track progress of re-construction. There were more NGOs operating on same location doing same thing. Volunteer visited same location for construction and re-constriction could be more managed and systematic if we had some platform where we all could access data and information of on-going processes.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<b>Problem Identification</b>\n\n\u00a0\n\n-Lack of proper information and data centre to track, evaluate and determine re-construction process\u00a0<span>and developmental works</span>\n\n-Lack of transparency on budget collected and utilized by NGO's, INGO's and governmental body at various levels\n\n-Absence of trust and faith of people on government and other organizations\n\n- Failure to accomplish donors expectation by properly executing projects in earlier time\n\n-Cluster and congestion of volunteers for re-construction and re-habilitation\n\n-Difficulties on finding right and required technical people\n\n-Gap of operation between various departments within government, organizational and other parties involve in development\n\n-Lack of availability of right connection with resource provider\n\n-Lack of maximum utilization of youth power (To some extent)\n\n\u00a0\n\n<b>What we want to do</b>\n\n\u00a0\n\n-A online portal as well as app based system (open source system) regulated by volunteers. Simply data and information sharing system which will be accessible and free to anyone who requires information about progress of relief and developmental works.\n\n\u00a0\n\n-We can make volunteering, governmental projects and organisational activities related to relief and re-construction more transparent and trustworthy by displaying project cost, employees pays, material cost, travel expenses and miscellaneous cost. This can be extended to others areas beyond relief and re-construction.\n\n\u00a0\n\n-To win trust from donors by letting them track their fund and see their donations reached to destination\n\n\u00a0\n\n-To motivate and encourage institutional partners to realize their corporate responsibility and develop habit of philanthropism\n\n\u00a0\n\n-Government, NGO, INGO and other organization will have access to online portal and will be regularly updated by them via app or website\n\n\u00a0\n\n-Information and data shared will be independent of political affiliations, purely un-biased &amp; irrespective of geographic locations, castes, creeds, languages\n\n\u00a0\n\n-Provision for industry, corporate house, business venture to have direct access to developmental organization will be provided so they can notify their interest of involvement will be included\n\n\u00a0\n\n-To channelize technical, non-technical, skilled, unskilled manpower for developmental activities\n\n\u00a0\n\n-To provide youth with internship, volunteering, field visits to generate skilled and qualified youths for tomorrow\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>Source of data and information collection</strong>\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The governmental ministry &amp; departments (local as well national), organizations (NGO's, INGO's), business venture will simply sign up and start sharing their data and information via app or web portal.

I see where you are coming from now and totally agree with you. It is very upsetting how creative tools and softwares that could do the job are sometimes just not used at all. And this is because you can make money developing it yourself and selling it. No incentives to partner for the money makers uh! - I liked the link you shared of the 500eu post. It clearly shows what is happening in the traditional world of public consultation. Online platforms are misused and when used aren't used ambitiously -just tick the box. Little research on what is out there...too much risk adverseness to try something new....long way to walk... Other problem i see is that those institutions / organisations are so hierarchical that only those with white hairs can make decisions. Ridiculous if compared with other sectors. Youngsters within those organisations can share, knock doors, push initiatives and make some noise but in most cases little happens. By the time the grey hairs come they will be too tired of pushing and probably just got used to the slow motion by then. - As for funding same people over and over this is related to risk adverseness again, practicality and lack of incentives. They have money to give but don't really care about the outcome, just the 'indicators' That will go into the report and make a pretty chart matter. That is about picking quick and make sure money goes and indicators come back...as narrow minded as that...also annoying. Anyway...thanks for sharing. Will have a look at that paper\n\n@Noemi it is good to hear you also dance tango! I had that experience of deciding to be a male/female tango dancer when I was 15 years old. With that philosophy I kept dancing both roles for all this years. This can be \"la revancha del tango\" as I can tell you I dance better as a male than many arrogant boys around there ;). I don't go to often to milongas here but happy to do a tango night one day.\u00a0\n\nRe: Baku I think I will be mostly in rural areas and lots of work to do so don't think will have much time. In any case, I can contact you friend and if time allows we could meet up.

GDocs?) and copy-pasting them into the rich text editor. For example, this post starts like this:</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=\"docs-internal-guid-0558bd29-1675-a636-8411-687604da5047\"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This post was co-written by [elf Pavlik], [katalin] and [Ben], the others trust in the process. Given our silence, we wanted to give a comprehensive overview of what we\u2019ve been up to and the challenges we\u2019ve faced.&lt;br class=\"kix-line-break\" /&gt;\n\n&lt;br class=\"kix-line-break\" /&gt;\n\nWe\u2019ll be doing a hangout later today, 17:00 CET.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n\n&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>this breaks the CSS. It can be fixed in two ways: \"hygiene\" (copy-paste in the Text-only editor, then manually add beautification like bold, bullet points etc.) or \"shoot in the heap\" (disable Full HTML and enable a Text Format called Limited HTML, that gets rid of all the &lt;div&gt;s and the &lt;span style&gt; but at the price of also stripping some wanted HTML tags like iframe. I think\u00a0this, too, is customizable, by the way: we can include iframe in the list of authorized tags in HTML. This is exactly the same as in Wordpress and, indeed, in Google Drive: copy paste across websites is typically not CSS neutral</li>\n\n<li>multiple languages are supported in Drupal. However, one should be careful because the default configuration for all multiple languages stuff (Wordpress too) is that you choose a visualization language and the websites shows you\u00a0<em>only</em> the content that has a translation that language. I dislike it because it reduces the chances of random encounter across members of the community. Of course, with Drupal it should not be difficult to enforce a mode whereby you are shown all content, in your preferred language if a translation is available and in the original language otherwise. In Egderyders 1 we had 1-click Google Translate integration.</li>\n\n</ul>", "created_at": "2014-02-14 11:52:59", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:45.895065", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 420, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [18652], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2518, "user_id": 9, "topic_id": 2485, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<em>Perhaps the silence has been deafening, or maybe no one noticed?\n\nThe past month has been a challenging one but we're beginning to emerge and are on the verge of breaking the silence, I hope I can safely say that over the coming weeks you'll hear a lot more about the developments of the unMonastery but before that happens I wanted to share something, an FAQ.\n\nThis is for the new website but more importantly to field the obvious questions of those who encounter the unMonastery in Matera.

It\u2019s worth checking out our [Projects page](LINK) to find out where you might make a connection, or let us know about your own project, perhaps we can help! Offline - Just drop by any time between 10:00 - 19:00, Tuesday to Saturday! [Palazzo del Casale, Rioni Sassi (Sasso Barisano), 75100 Matera](LINK) Online - [Contact us](LINK)\n\nWhat are the objectives of the unMonastery?\n\nWe are working together as a group to establish a new model for co-living and co-working which borrows from the history of the monastery as an organisational form. This is the first unMonastery - it is a prototype. The model is aimed at addressing the interlinked needs of disused or abandoned space, unemployment and depleting social services by combining these problems together in order to find a solution.\n\nWhat is the unMonastery trying to do in Matera?\n\nWe believe that you can\u2019t begin to design solutions until you understand the problems - so our first steps in Matera have been to meet with people, share our [projects](LINK) and listen to the things that the people of Matera tell us about what we should be doing. We understand that the unMonastery comes from the outside, our participants are from diverse backgrounds, geographies and share different skillsets, but together we share a common objective as a group; &gt; The desire to begin a process in supporting active citizenship in Matera by engaging formal or informal groups and established institutions, in an open dialogue about how we can improve our daily lives together, through collaboration, understanding and meaningful work. We offer ourselves and our services to the Citizenry of Matera.\n\nIs it free to visit and participate in the unMonastery?\n\nAll our workshops and events are free and open. The unMonastery is an experiment at the edges of dominant economic structures. We share our skills and ideas. You share what you have.\n\nWho pays for the unMonastery?\n\nSince the project started in 2012 it has been supported by the work of the [EdgeRyders](http://www.edgeryders.eu/) community, many people have worked together without finances to make the project happen. The prototype of unMonastery in Matera has been funded by the municipality for the period of 4 months and we have been granted the use of a building. Individuals receive a subsistence level per-diem of 400 Euro a month, which provides for living expenses and project materials. We will be publishing all our expenses publically as part of our [Open Finance Initiative](LINK). We are also working on a [Sustainability Plan](LINK) to ensure the unMonastery can succeed without the use of public or private funds in the future.\n\nWho are the unMonasterians?\n\nThe prototype in Matera is set to host 14 individuals from all over the world, you can find out more about these individuals on the [people pages](LINK). Beyond the group based in Matera there are many international collaborators and networks contributing to the development of the overall project.\n\nHow did the unMonastery start?\n\nThe unMonastery was developed in collaboration with EdgeRyders LBG over the course of the last 18 months. Edgeryders started out as a project by the Council of Europe and the European Commission, which after termination developed into an international community run social enterprise. The unMonastery continues to live and grow as part of the EdgeRyders community, you can join that process on the [platform](http://www.edgeryders.eu/unmonastery/).\n\nWhat is the relationship between unMonastery and other institutions or organisations connected to Matera?\n\nEdgeryders is the mother community out of which unMonastery was born. Matera 2019 Committee saw it as strategically beneficial for Matera and so chose to support the creation of the first unMonastery in Matera as part of the bid for Cultural Capital of Europe 2019. We hope to collaborate with many other groups during our stay here, so please get in [contact](LINK) if you\u2019re interested.\n\nWhy is it called *unMonastery*?\n\nThe historical role of the monastery in Europe involved a range of features, including: 1. A physical place - building or set of buildings; 2. Set within or nearby a community; 3. members committed to a particular way of being within their home; 4. and to helping and serving the community that they were located in. These are features that the unMonastery reproduces. It's the 'Monastery' in unMonastery. Other Monasteries have historically also included features such as a strict hierarchy, male only and submission to a fixed religious ideology. These are features that we're not interested in reproducing, which is the reason for the 'un' in *unMonastery*. Our current definition is this: un\u00b7Mon\u00b7as\u00b7ter\u00b7y (un-m\u014fn\u2032\u0259-st\u0115r\u2032\u0113) n. pl. un\u00b7mon\u00b7as\u00b7ter\u00b7ies 1. The place in which we gather. 2. A group that comes together to collaborate on shared social challenges. 3. A prototype that is redefined in each iteration by its participants, context and it\u2019s outcomes. 4. The beginning of something different.\n\nWhat happens at the unMonastery?\n\nLots of things, too many to list but here\u2019s a few ways you can find out: 1. Visit our [Events page](LINK) 2. Check out individual [projects](LINK) 3. Read our latest [News](LINK) 4. [Visit](LINK) us Can I use your space? We encourage active participation and we welcome you to come and propose a workshop or event in collaboration with our present work.\n\nHow will you gauge the success of your work in Matera?\n\nWe aim to start a process that will be beneficial for the people of Matera, we will measure our success based on the ability for the projects and processes we produce to continue after our departure. Alternatively success may be quantified by finding a way to extend the project without continued financial aid.\n\nHow will you ensure people not living in the Sassi find out about the unMonastery?\n\nMany of the projects take place outside of the Sassi. We are aware that the Sassi does not represent Matera as a whole. We are currently connecting with local schools, citizen initiatives, and community projects, which have a diverse base. In order to gain greater awareness for the scope of the city -whilst also being useful- we\u2019ve introduced the [*Open Street Map Challenges*](LINK), to explore the whole of Matera.\n\nWhy Matera?\n\nMatera, is cited by the unMonasterians as the natural birthplace for the unMonastery Prototype due to its deep relationship to early monastic orders and the role that monasteries played during past centuries.\n\nYou didn\u2019t answer all of my questions!\n\nIf this FAQ didn\u2019t satisfy your curiosity we invite you to come and [visit us](LINK) or send a message to XXX and we\u2019ll answer the question here.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-03-08 21:31:56", "updated_at": "2018-06-01 08:41:34.370414", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1430, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18900, "user_id": 264, "topic_id": 3942, "post_number": 14, "raw": "now Apache Wave ;-)\n\n", "created_at": "2015-01-05 13:39:57", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:45.330943", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 5, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [18812], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8070, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 4718, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>very interesting!</b>\n\na great initiative.

Supposedly it would also allow you to change the focus from the \"professional\" aspects to personal wellbeing and better self care to balance your life.

William Domhoff, and Frances Piven on the essentially corporatist nature of the \"progressive\" regulatory/welfare state.\u00a0 I also read the Anarchist FAQ, of which Iain McKay is the primary author, and studied in depth the histories of other anarchist traditions.\u00a0 As with Rothbard &amp; Co., I had a great deal of affinity with anarcho-communist and syndicalist thinkers, and considered them anarchist comrades, while only selectively and skeptically incorporating their ideas into my framework.\n\nSo by the time I emerged from this process, I was firmly on the Left and had settled into a fairly stable individualist anarchist or left-wing free market ideological framework.\u00a0 I considered myself on the marginal fringes of both the libertarian socialist and free market libertarian movements, and tended to think of more mainstream thinkers in both traditions as comrades who were misguided in some particulars but who I could work with in many others.\n\nAs you can imagine, I saw the Seattle demo and subsequent AG movement, which emerged about this time, as a very exciting time.\u00a0\n\nIn the meantime, I began reading Chomsky's analysis of world politics and American foreign policy -- the first book of his I read was <em>Deterring Democracy</em>, and I read most of the others in the year 2000.\u00a0 I played hunt-the-footnote with him as I did with Kirk Sale, reading William Blum's <em>Killing Hope</em> and a lot of other material on the continuity between Washington's role and Nazi Germany's as the chief anti-insurgent superpower, assorted coups and death squads, and the oceans of blood that were spilled to keep the world safe for corporate power.\n\nIn Summer 2001, having discovered the Internet the previous year, I began to gravitate toward Proudhonian mutualist groups like Larry Gambone's Voluntary Cooperation Movement, as well as participating in debates in more mainstream anarchist venues like Iain McKay's anarchy list and the A-Infos news list.\u00a0 My first real work in print, \"<a href=\"https://mutualist.org/id4.html\">The Iron Fist Behind the Invisible Hand</a>,\" was published by Gambone's Red Lion Press about the time of the 9/11 attacks.\n\nIn 2002, becoming increasingly tired of smug assertions in the Austrian economics discussion venues I frequented that Bohm-Bawerk and Mises had \"disproved\" the labor theory of value, I began the intensive reading in classical political economy, Marx and the Marxians, and the Austrians and marginalists, that led to <a href=\"http://www.mutualist.org/id47.html\"><em>Studies in Mutualist Political Economy</em></a>.\u00a0 My purpose was to rehabilitate the labor theory of value and the associated socialist theory of exploitation, but to do so within a Tuckerite market framework and in a way that responded to marginalist critiques by Bohm-Bawerk, Jeavons and Marshall.\n\nAround this time, I began to discover that \"free market anticapitalism,\" of the state as the friend of big business and the enabler of exploitation, was a meme whose time had come.\u00a0 It was \"steam engine time.\"\u00a0 I encountered a number of thinkers like Roderick Long whose analysis was very similar to my own.\u00a0 We began to coalesce into a conscious movement, eventually culminating in Center for a Stateless Society (about which more below).\n\n<em>Mutualist Political Economy</em>, in developing the thesis of state-enforced monopoly as the source of exploitation, included a lengthy section on historic capitalism (with heavy reliance on Marxist analysis of primitive accumulation) and the crisis tendencies of developed capitalism (with heavy reliance on vol. 3 of Capital and the neo-Marxists at Monthly Review).\u00a0 As I said tongue-in-cheek in the Preface, it was intended as an analysis of the laws of motion of corporate capitalism, past, present and future.\u00a0\n\nReading analysis of the Seattle movement and earlier networked movements of the '90s initially sparked my interest in network culture and organization as a tool of resistance.\u00a0 I did a lot of reading in the work of David Ronfeldt and John Arquilla at Rand on swarming attacks, netwar, etc., and Rheingold on flash mobs, as a new form of resistance made possible by the Internet.\n\nIn the process of writing the parts of <em>Mutualist Political Economy</em> on crisis tendencies of late capitalism, I read intensively from Ivan Illich and Paul Goodman, and R.A. Wilson.\u00a0 This inspired my next writing project, <a href=\"http://mutualist.blogspot.com/2005/12/studies-in-anarchist-theory-of.html\"><em>Organization Theory:\u00a0 A Libertarian Perspective</em></a>.\u00a0 I won't describe it in any detail here beyond saying the original picture on the tin -- that virally popular \"<a href=\"http://www.getsocialpr.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/head-up-ass.jpg\">head up ass</a>\" picture of a guy with necktie and briefcase inserting his head into his own rectum, which I had to replace when a copyright troll claimed \"ownership\" of it -- was a fair indication of the contents.\n\nAbout the time I finished <em>Organization Theory</em>, at the end of 2008, I was hired as a research associate and commentator at Center for a Stateless Society (C4SS), a left-wing market anarchist think tank.\u00a0 Starting on 2007 I also made some progress as a freelance writer, selling articles to <em>The Freeman</em> (edited by my good friend Sheldon Richman) and other periodicals.\u00a0 Writing hasn't been enough to live on without my work as a hospital orderly, but it's been enough to pay off my debts and accumulate a nice little pile of F.U. money.\n\nIn the process of writing <em>Organization Theory</em>, in turn, I developed even more of an interest in networked culture, and particularly in the open-source/free culture movement.\u00a0 I became aware for the first time of the micromanufacturing and open-source hardware movements, and the kind\u00a0 of stuff going on in places like Factor e Farm. It was in this period that I made the acquaintance of Michel Bauwens and began hanging around e-lists like the P2P Foundation's email discussion list and the Open Manufacturing Google Group.\u00a0 It brought me into contact with a lot of people whose work influenced me heavily like Sam Rose, Eric Hunting, Vinay Gupta, Athina Karatzogianni and Andy Robinson.\n\nIt was this new complex of ideas that became the subject of my next book, <a href=\"http://homebrewindustrialrevolution.wordpress.com/\"><em>The Homebrew Industrial Revolution:\u00a0 A Low-Overhead Manifesto</em></a>.\u00a0 It started with an analysis of the old mass-production economy as a historical dead-end, a state-subsidized dinosaur, and proceeded to describe the forces that would supplant it:\u00a0 relocalized micromanufacturing with cheap open-source CNC machine tools, and household microenterprises producing for the informal and barter economy.\n\nAs with my previous books, ideas I touched on in <em>Homebrew</em> inspired my next writing project.\u00a0 That would be my next book, <a href=\"http://desktopregulatorystate.wordpress.com\"><em>The Desktop Regulatory State</em></a>.\u00a0 In writing <em>Homebrew</em>, I presupposed -- and mentioned in passing -- the effect of the desktop revolution on immaterial production, and destroying the material basis of corporate power in the information and cultural realms.\u00a0 I decided to develop that idea in depth as a book in its own right.\u00a0\n\nA second contributing current to the <em>Desktop Regulatory State</em> originally came to my attention when \"Doocing,\" or the firing of bloggers for negative comments about employers.\u00a0 I synthesized this with my earlier reading of Ronfeldt and Arquilla on netwar, along with Naomi Klein on culture jamming, the Wobblies on open-mouth sabotage, Frank Kernaghan's \"culture jamming\" against Kathie Lee Gifford, and networked labor models like the Coalition of Imolakee Workers.\u00a0 The result of this line of thought appears, in roughly similar form, in several places:\u00a0 \"<a href=\"http://mutualist.blogspot.com/2007/04/media-print-projection-embossed-body.html\">The Ethics of Labor Struggle:\u00a0 A Free Market Perspective</a>,\" \"<a href=\"http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/open-mouth-sabotage-networked-resistance-and-asymmetric-warfare-on-the-job/2008/03/15\">Open-Mouth Sabotage, Networked Resistance, and Asymmetric Warfare on the Job</a>,\" \"<a href=\"http://members.tripod.com/kevin_carson/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/Chapter9.pdf\">Chapter Nine -- Special Agency Problems of Labor</a>\" in <em>Organization Theory</em>, and \"<a href=\"http://c4ss.org/content/4163\">Labor Struggle -- A Libertarian Model</a>\" (Center for a Stateless Society, 2010).\n\nMy next book involves putting these two strands together and generalizing them.\u00a0 The wage-factory system was originally justified by the shift from individually affordable craft tools to enormously expensive, specialized, capital-intensive machinery.\u00a0 The latter could only be afforded by enormously rich people pooling their resources to buy it and then hiring others to work it.\u00a0 Administering the costly machinery and the large workforce required large, hierarchical institutions run by professional managers.\u00a0 In Galbraith's model of countervailing power, only other large, hierarchical institutions, run by professional managers, could restrain the power of business corporations.\u00a0 The problem was that these regulatory bodies tended to cluster, in practice, in complexes of allied institutions.\n\nAs I pointed out in <em>Homebrew</em>, the desktop revolution had destroyed the rationale for the factory system (for the music studios, giant publishing houses, etc.) in the realms of desktop publishing, garage recording and sound editing, open-source software, etc.\u00a0 And the micromanufacturing revolution, by lowering the cost of a \"factory\" by two orders of magnitude, is doing the same for physical production.\u00a0 We're going back to individually affordable, general purpose craft tools.\u00a0 As Tom Coates remarked, in the immaterial realm, the desktop computer has destroyed the gap between what can be produced at work and what can be produced at home.\u00a0 So there's no need for \"work\" any more.\n\nMy argument in <em>The Desktop Regulatory State</em> is that the desktop revolution has done the same thing to regulatory state functions.\u00a0 The desktop computer, network organization with near-zero coordination costs, stigmergic cooperation on the Wikipedia/Al Qaeda/file-sharing model, streaming video, and the possibilities opened up by Web 2.0 for \"open-mouth sabotage\" against all kinds of corporate malefactors, enable what John Robb calls \"superempowered individuals\" to take on giant authoritarian institutions on an equal basis.\u00a0 The desktop revolution has eliminated the barrier between the kinds of \"regulation\" that can be carried out from an office in a government agency, and what we can do at home.\n\nAs you can guess, the emergence or newfound prominence of Wikileaks, the Arab Spring, Occupy and Anonymous, in the middle of my work in writing this book, has been enormously encouraging to me.\u00a0 I'm beginning to think I may have understated my thesis.\u00a0 Streaming video, as I argued <em>here</em>, is <em>more</em> effective than a police commission in exposing and punishing evildoers.\u00a0 And \"doxing\" operations, like those LulzSec and AntiSec have carried out against HBGary, the BART police and Stratfor, are achieving what the lapdog regulatory state never could.\n\nAs I'm fond of saying, the twentieth century was the era of the giant organization.\u00a0 By the end of the twenty-first, there won't be enough of them left to bury.\u00a0 We'll display their bleeding heads on our battlements.\n\nBesides the sense of hope from living in a time like this, when authoritarian institutions are getting curb-stomped every time I turn on the news, I can't get over the sense of undeserved grace I have from my writing career.\u00a0 Before the Internet, I would have been one of millions of (if you'll pardon the phrase) mute, inglorious Miltons, piling up manuscripts that would moulder away in someone's attic, and never seeing print except via the occasional cranky letter to the editor.\u00a0 I'm sure some people like Andrew Keen would consider that a good thing.\u00a0 A few centuries earlier, I'd have been an illiterate jug-eared Lowland Scots peasant hoeing turnips to pay rent to some lord.\u00a0\n\nSo I'm amazed at my good fortune in being able to \"own my own printing press,\" and write stuff that's read by thousands of people.\u00a0 I've been able to contact activists and scholars all over the world, just by Googling their email to comment on something I read.\u00a0 I'm very lucky to be living in these times.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-20 00:28:32", "updated_at": "2017-09-20 14:32:58.447123",

I like to think of myself as problem solver - but that really is for others to judge. I am aware I will be preaching to the lambish in a harsh tone. Sorry about that @Noemi . @Hegazy @hazem I think this could feed into some of the considerations that you nicely bring up in the networking visualization*. With the book coming up ( @Nadia ) I thought I'd try to throw in a provocative minority opinion, and see if this will get us somewhere.\n\nAfter I listened to the article linked above I thought about the issue for a while. Then some more. Then I started writing my take on the issue, but decided it would not reach the people I want to reach somewhere on page 4 or so. So here is the simplified short form.\n\nThe secret lies in:\n\n1. Finding one or more introverts deeply engaged in an issue.\n\n2. Then getting a signal out of them that carries the detail and reasoning to make another introvert understand the problem<em> and emotionally commit</em>.\n\n3. Transmitting the signal through a network of extroverts <em>without breaking it</em>.\n\n4. Detecting the special way some introvert in a closet <em>frowns</em> at the message - and <em>correctly discerning</em> that this means he/she is on the brink of committing ten or more years of his/her life to the issue. Weak signals.\n\n5. Gently and <em>extremely considerately nudge</em> the addressed introvert towards the other introverts. If that does not work, understanding which case can be helped by what kind of pressure (hint: only 1 in 10 can).\n\nSounds simple right? Just 5 steps to world domination...\n\nThe trick is that each of the steps has requirements the respective subjects will by default <em>not do</em>, or do in a very, <em>very</em> bad way. If you don't feel offended by this sentence - this is highly likely true for you as well. Sorry. <em>Please do feel offended</em>, this is not going to work in anyone's comfort zone (or it would be happening all the time). I'll explain each of the steps in a little more detail. Just to rub it in.\n\n1. If you fail at the first step the game ends there. It can't be skipped. As I am talking to extrovert community managers**, you need to start with finding an introvert. This will be hard for many of you because the last time you saw one is \"the unpopular kid\" in school. After this compulsory community, most strong extros mingle with other strong extros - and intros almost vanish from their life as it is awkward to have one between 8 other extros. Imagine the unpopular kid did not vanish, but once in a while checked your social network accounts in the last couple of years, and just shook his/her head at what you were doing. How misguided. How superficial. Most of the intros time however went into building self esteem over (failed attempts at) solving some ridiculously complicated, almost impossible problem.\n\nHow do you find this person? It is hard. You can look through your network all you want - it is full of other extros. And they are isolated. Especially, the powerful and strong intros. What are you to do? Ring random doorbells? Not quite, but searching for activities that would attract introverts may help (<a href=\"http://8tracks.com/explore/introvert\">certain music</a> or <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/wiki/index#wiki_movies\">movies</a> are a strong cue if they apply to your culture). In short: Go where other people (especially you and your friends) don't like to go, and see who is there. <em>Listen and watch</em> for weak signals. Another method would be to bring a couple of your extrovert friends to a relatively random crowd, and then be very extrovert in everyone's face. The ones that are running away are the ones you're looking for.\n\nThis can be easier and usually much faster to do on/with the internet. Actually, if you end up in a place that you don't understand, and people behave strangely - chances are you <a href=\"http://physics.ucsd.edu/do-the-math/2015/04/programmed-to-ignore/\">stumbled upon a community of <em>mild</em> intros</a>. <strong>The strong introvert is like a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/x3Fz1V3LZtw?t=2530\">Yeti</a>. It leaves big footsteps but is rarely seen in person. </strong>\n\nSometimes a mild intro may be the gatekeeper of one or more strong intros. Thus getting to the <em>real</em> powerful connections is always a two step process. First you have to win trust and show you can engage an intro on their terms. Then you get into their sanctum. Having <em>intro-respected</em> people who will vow for your integrity makes things easier as you progress. But remember, you are in a different ecosystem that has <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/K_selection_theory\">different requirements and different dynamics</a>. Okay, this was <em>long</em> - because you have to get it right or there is no point.\n\n2. If you have an issue and found your introvert, you will have to find out <em>this </em>introverts needs. For that you'll have to understand in quite some detail what he/she is trying to achieve. Then discuss or observe how the work is conducted. If you can think of ways to improve the workflow you could carefully put them on the table, mostly to watch why and how they will be declined. Assume an intro will be too shy to tell you about the real motivation, so watch for weak signals on that. Networking / collaboration opportunities to be may be be ignored (often because they don't mix with the work mode). Carefully feel around why each opportunity is not taken, and let the explanations stand for now. We'll come to the emotional commitment in point 4.\n\n3. The \"without breaking it\" part is crucial. I have done and attended quite a bit of interviews with conventional main stream media on scientific topics. Almost without fail, they disfigure the message - not seldom making <em>exactly</em> the mistake you explicitly implored them not to do. Less mainstream media (introvert niches) usually fares better. In the age of exact copy&amp;paste or digital recording options this <em>can</em> be improved a lot. Just make sure whatever happens, the original detailed data can be quickly found, and you find a combination of cat pictures (transmission) and differential equations (reception) you can both live with.\n\n4. If you got this far you already have a decent chance at this part. Unfortunately introverts are pretty diverse on some fronts (and blindingly simple on some others) so tread carefully initially. Chances are, if you come across as informed and sincere, and the other intro you have in tow is compatible, the emotional commitment part is not going to be difficult for you. It'll be more difficult for <em>you </em>to believe someone will have a emotional reaction to such a complicated concept.\n\nGetting yourself to understand the <em><strong>detail necessary</strong> </em>to make an informed choice on whom to approach is probably the hard part. Introverts survive deep in specialist niches. Leaving this exact niche because some \"shallow new guy\" blathers something about it being a good idea is a recipe for disaster. Make a solid case why this is a risk worth taking, and remember the risk is mostly on the specialist. Even though these niches are hard to find it is often smarter to try again somewhere else than to force things. If you did your job well up to here you can often get some very valuable guidance into more appropriate parts of the community. Resist the urge to ask for endorsement if it is not signaled.\n\n5. I'll just repeat: 1 in 10!\n\nHow many cases did you do already? Less than 5? That would in all likelihood make it a bad idea. Remember intros are generally careful, risk averse people operating in a complicated environment. It is easy to break stuff that won't be fixable for you.\n\n*People use networks differently - thus networks should look differently to different people. There is no one size fits all. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator\">MBTI</a> is probably a good middle ground starting point.\n\n**The introverts can ask me for an \"introvert way to world domination\" - which I know they won't. :)\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-23 19:34:57", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:09.398383", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1500, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [10056], "is_liked_by": [2580, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32698, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4374, "post_number": 26, "raw": "<b>Niice!</b>\n\nWe also toyed with the \"school of superheroes\" concept when we were designing the original Edgeryders.

Part of them should be used to transform the bacteria and freeze those at -80\u00b0C in a glycerol stock.\n\nOpen Biolab has most things equipment/some consumables available to do the transformation, as well as storage. The option of getting an own -80\u00b0C freezer (Wim knows of one) is not ideal right now - high electricity use and it\u2019s very big/heavy for just storing a few samples. It will be simpler to do it at a uni for now.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe will need about \u20ac400 (minus materials we can find ourselves) to get started with the lab work.

Concrete milestones would make the plan better. A first step is already clear: replicating the Oakland work with the plasmids we receive. Although our work can be more useful on downstream processing, this way we gain experience, prove reproducibility and have a reference point for when we change the construct. After that, the roadmap and milestone should offer us some focus, as there are many options to test (different organisms, different linkers, microfluidics optimization, \u2026)\n\nThere are already plenty of papers on the Google Drive, thanks to the work of the teams in Oakland and Sydney.\n\n<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-5d0a3b30-87c1-8e74-4e1b-4b45fc1e07c1\">\u00a0</b>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-5d0a3b30-87c1-8e74-4e1b-4b45fc1e07c1\">Microfluidics</b></h3>\n\nOn testing multiple conditions: Wim mentioned the work of Peter Schotte with 3D printed caps for shaking flasks that are a simple, cheap way for changes in conditions.

We can use the hackathon in Amsterdam for this. There will be many experts present, as well as the chips of Digi.bio.

Building LOTE together is a way to kickstart the work of building the unMonastery so maybe <a href=\"/t/making-lote3/360/fast-forward-through-community-calls\">loop people in on those calls</a> rather than try to maintain a separate one?\n\n<strong>Output: </strong>Each call is <a href=\"/t/making-lote3/360/fast-forward-through-community-calls\">summarised and \u00a0followed up on</a> via a <a href=\"http://us2.campaign-archive1.com/home/?u=2426561089e1f5ab32da252cd&amp;id=8a173e588c\">newsletter</a> to people who have signed up for \\#LOTE and status updates on <a href=\"/topics/social-media\">various social media channels</a>. [Auli]\u00a0who is also a drupal wiz it volunteered to do the weekly newsletter, [Dorotea] is coordinating the social media team, and [Noemi] is on top of all things community management related. Maybe ping for some help?\n\n<strong>How did we get here: </strong>By doing lots of outreach through keynotes at conferences and\u00a0videos\u00a0like <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/68839894\">this one</a>. As well as by\u00a0not determining a priori what roles or working spaces are needed, but leaving them open for participants in the call who take responsibility for getting something done to design according to their needs.\u00a0We asked everyone in the first call if they would be up for adapting the Edgeryders platform to their needs and the consensus was yes, because the community platform is well managed and there is now quite a lot of activity on it. If you're running a separate online presence you cant piggyback on the excitement that we've been generating also for the unMonastery e.g. through <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/139226634/The-unMonastery-making-sense-of-making-a-living\">presentation\u00a0at Ouisharefest</a>.\u00a0\n\nmy 2 cents.\n\nxx\n\n", "created_at": "2013-07-29 08:31:26", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:19.978516", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 490, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [207], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24353, "user_id": 3362, "topic_id": 6330, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>A Masterclass indeed</b>\n\nA class given by a Master of the trade.

If there is enough money on offer for everyone who orders it to get at least some, it's no problem, But we expect it to be less than 3-4% of the the turnover initially, which is the ratio the platform operators would use for <em>prioritized</em> wishes for money, effectively converting some of its commission fees (that are charged in-kind) to money for covering hosting and other running costs. We will however not prevent users from offering money as a product, and them making it a hybrid system this way seems to have no adverse side effects to my knowledge. The platform still gets its own money share when somebody uses the \"buy-now\" feature, effectively catalyzing the execution of a certain order by putting in some (10-30%) contribution in money.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Partitioning time.</strong> True. The suggestion is that people offer task-specific packages of time as fixed-price products (like: \"writing blog post of 1000-1300 words\"). Other time will be packetized by those who need a task done, by using the \"outsource task\" feature. All other worktime will not be packetized but traded as regular project contributions via the \"authorized worktime\" feature. This means postpaid payment (work first, get the compensation coming in over time). It includes thus a certain amount of P2P debt, with the benefit that payment of worktime can be infinitely partitioned, while worktime can not. (This flexibility helps the network barter algorithm by providing \"filler material\": it can include payment amounts for worktime in cent increments, starting from 0.01 EUR).</li>\n\n<li><strong>Direct donations.</strong> Everybody works only for tasks they want to do, by clicking \"I want to do this\" for tasks and having \"authorized worktime\" agreements with projects. (Only when providing services as pre-packaged packages like products, you have no control over who orders it. That's why we don't recommend doing it. Or if the need arises, we could have a feature that the seller has to confirm incoming orders when offering a pre-packaged service.) Direct donations are no problem to handle out of a compensation system, so people could simply continue doing so. Maybe you think it's nice to have it in there so one can create \"contribution graphs\" and have metrics of merit for reputation? That sounds like an interesting addition interesting to me, and we can investigate it at some time after the beta.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Clean slates.</strong> That's always possible, because: there are no slates :-) Even the donation \"hack\" does not introduce debt! Namely, if I have ordered \"thank yous\" of Alice to support her project, but things get awry or I get burned out by donating too much, I can simply take back all orders that have not yet been executed. Just like I can modify unexecuted orders for other projects.\n\nOf course, then donations mean no guarantee of income for a project; this is bad in some circumstances like barter-based crowdfunding. There, a special feature would prohibit later modification of such orders that were made to crowdfunding. Which introduces debt of course, which is probably why we'll avoid adding in-kind crowdfunding ...)</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nA research project? Great! Something that could be a source for further funding and study of this proposal and the math behind it, would be warmly appreciated :) If one day a specific collaboration idea for Economy App and some economist's research gets into your mind, tell us please! (We already have an initial indication of interest from a PhD student in economics \u2013 she'd maybe investigate if network barter could be a large-scale alternative to austerity.)\n\n", "created_at": "2013-12-27 16:58:44", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:42.598340", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 683, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [13087], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3573, "user_id": 1639, "topic_id": 3540, "post_number": 1, "raw": "As discussed in last week's community call, this wiki can serve as a documentation toolkit for participants who want to tell the stories of sessions and projects before, during, and after \\#LOTE4.\n\nWhat is our goal? capture detailed snippets of the event beyond a show off of the mood and fun, looking-good stuff that most people are concerned about when it comes to events.. which is immediately important but doesn't help much with follow up and building serious conversations on top of what is happening in a room at a certain moment.\u00a0\n\nHow do we use documentation?

But some things may become scarce (supplies of consumables and fuel) or will have to change (many procedures).</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>The overall suggestion is we could look at <strong>networks</strong> for help. Networks could be activated (or created) in order to look at:</span>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><span><strong>Supplies</strong> (energy, consumables): prioritise transport, synthesise some medication locally, repurpose existing physical resources, etc.</span></li>\n\n<li><span><strong>Procedures</strong>: networks look at prioritary aims and adapt procedures: solve things at primary care level if hospital or ambulances fail, boil germs if there\u2019s no electricity, etc.</span></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<span>Personally I\u2019ve been looking at Vinay Gupta\u2019s Simple Critical Infrastructure Maps (SCIM) model for a pandemic, which would be a different scenario.</span>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><span>The model is simply a spreadsheet of \u201cneeds\u201d x \u201clevels\u201d.</span></li>\n\n<li><span>One example of \u201cneed\u201d is food, and it\u2019s solved at different \u201clevels\u201d; in my personal case, food is grown internationally and brought to me via international-national-local transport. So, if international markets or transport break, I\u2019d have to look elsewhere or grow food locally. (Poor farmers grow their food locally, and use no transport. In a bad-weather crisis, they need international supplies delivered to them. Or they move.)</span></li>\n\n<li><span>Vinay\u2019s model includes \u201ctoo hot, too cold, hunger, thirst, disease and injury\u201d (for the individual), \u201ccommunication, transport, workplace and resource-sharing\u201d (for groups), and up to a total of 18 items for organisations and nation-states.</span></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<span>If the health system is a big organisation (really, a network of many organisations), then we want to look at more specific needs, which are covered by existing provision-systems, and if those provision-systems break then we need to look at alternatives (because needs stay with us!).</span>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><span>In health systems, the basic needs of the individual (shelter/clothes, water, food) and groups (communications, transport) are still there.</span></li>\n\n<li><span>Specialised needs include: \"sterilisation\", \"main groups of meds\" (anesthetics, painkillers, insulin, cancerkillers, etc), \"communications\" (need can be produced by good protocols for local action), etc. Not a comprehensive list, but the rest can be inferred by analogy.</span></li>\n\n<li><span>If the electric grid fails, \"sterilisation\" can still be done with generators or boiling. If medicine markets fail, we\u2019d be looking at making them locally if we can, etc.</span></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<span>Here\u2019s how I'd suggest we approach the 2.5 hour session:</span>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><span>In 15 minutes (or less) I\u2019d briefly explain how (I think) healthcare works using the SCIM model, and together we\u2019d focus on what breaks in our scenario.</span></li>\n\n<li><span>In 15</span><span> minutes, our network experts would look at it from the \u201cnetwork\u201d point of view. I can imagine some things (each person has contact with others within the system), but not others. Together we can flesh it out, learn and contribute to the solutions, so do come!</span></li>\n\n<li><span>We can then make groups of 3-4 people for each area. Each area would pose a specific subchallenge, and each group would be expected to come up with workable ideas. (If there are many areas, a group might want to do more than one area if they work really fast.)</span></li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<span>AREAS:</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>What are the areas? A hyper-complex system such as \u201chealth\u201d can be split up in many different ways. The general focus is \u201c</span><span>we have people and buildings and knowledge, but supplies may be costly or unavailable</span><span>\u201d. We think the following might work as \u201c</span><span>sub-focus areas</span><span>\u201d for our creative thinking:</span>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><span>Peer-to-peer diagnosis and treatment. (Even diagnosis of epidemics?)</span></li>\n\n<li><span>Low-cost pharmaceutical products: medicines, prosthetics, etc. (Include water filters, compost toilets, hand washing in case there\u2019s a general break-down and not just health-care is affected?)</span></li>\n\n<li><span>Prevention through life-style changes: can we help each other live healthier lives and enjoy the process?</span></li>\n\n<li><span>Cooperative help when there\u2019s need for transport (or this is part of \\#1).</span></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<span>Can you bring expertise to one or more of these areas? Can you suggest more areas? Do you have specific ideas we shouldn\u2019t have to re-think?</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>WORKABLE IDEAS:</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>Coming up with workable ideas would be done by looking at two aspects:</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><span>What are the networks involved: what people are closest to the problem? who provides the services now? who could provide some alternatives?</span></li>\n\n<li><span>How would the sub-focus needs be \"solved\": reinforce the present system if possible, substitute some elements, do a full redesign of the provision system, change some protocols, etc. Here, creative thinking can be applied to the fullest. If you\u2019re a permaculturist, please apply permacultural design principles such as \u201crelative location for mutual service\u201d, etc.</span></li>\n\n</ul>", "created_at": "2012-06-11 20:43:30", "updated_at": "2018-02-09 07:40:04.963544", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2351, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23341, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 1459, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>That's a way to go</b>\n\nAlberto, your proposal seems good and balanced to me. About being a privacy adviser volunteer: yes why not, count me in. I'm not an expert on all this, but I have a basic understanding what <em>could</em> be done with data ... . When you need some input for the page on the anonymization process or the like, just drop me a line.\n\n<strong>One addition to the proposal.</strong> I'd still propose to add to the \"Legals\" page more about the research methods that will be used, and that the data will be provided as package for download, and about what data is collected by means of ethnographic annotations and how the anonymizing process will work (according to your above proposal).\n\n<strong>And three notes.</strong> To clean out remaining misunderstandings:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>I did not expect that you really want to open access to the server and its logs etc.. That was merely an illustrative general example (not referring to Edgeryders at all) on how de-anonymizing data is prohibited by existing privacy laws, and how \"novel use\" and correlation of data can lead to unimagined problems ...</li>\n\n<li>About your point 2, mentioning \"Some people here <em>want</em> to be recognized; in fact, I expect this will be the case for most of them.\" and the example of collaborating with institutions by reporting to a council or parliament. Let me make the content/data difference still clearer, as my point revolves around that only. Yes, most people, including me, want to be recognized when it is about their <em>content</em>, that is, human perception and processing of their ideas, one idea at a time. Given that people would understand the difference, I doubt that this extends to a desire to be recognized in <em>data</em>, where it's about computational processing of structured information, correlations, network analysis, and not-yet-imagined novel uses (like personality profiling) by anyone who downloads the data package. I for one am <em>not</em> open to be identifiable in data, just like I'm not open to undergo personality profiling or the like before appearing at a parliament ... .\u00a0In my view, you just don't know what will become out of a data package in the wild, so we better be careful with that ... like you said, \"erring on the side of safety\". (I know there are these post-privacy people who do away with the concept of privacy altogether in the Internet age, but Edgeryders is not made of these only so it should provide anonymity if so desired.)</li>\n\n<li>The notion of \"20 years\" was a wild guess for how long the Edgeryders data package might be around. Because it's open content, it can be provided by other people for download, even after the Edgeryders site is down. And nobody can do anything to stop that, should it turn out afterwards that leaving people identifiable in the data was not a good idea after all ...</li>\n\n</ul><strong>Proposal for future projects.</strong> In case you're going to manage more projects like Edgeryders in the future, maybe it's advisable to separate the platform right form the start into a \"story collection\" and a \"socializing\" part. The story collection would focus on collecting short accounts of peoples experiences in different areas, maybe even with a max. word count. And it would be stated right at the starte that these stories will be used and published as structured data which can be processed and mined automatically, so people would be advised to not mention any names or projects or organizations. And in the socializing area, there would be a rather open discussion space. It could be likewise open content but would not make it into structured data packages for download, so people would be free to give names etc. if they like. This area might even provide web-based query and evaluation and annotation tools to start evaluating the stories data right on the platform, with the help of the crowd. If that works out, it might help to drive costs down.\n\n<div style=\"position: absolute; top: 12px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden; left: -1000px;\">\u00a0</div>", "created_at": "2012-05-09 16:28:32", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:09.648713", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 722, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [20628], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7779, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 4297, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Another hypernaut here</b>\n\nHi Annet,\n\nwelcome to our home on the internets.

Powerpoint style presentations are expected, you may even prepare a demo, show a short video exceprt (if you need sound, we may need to bring a set of speakers).\n\nAs previously agreed (<a href=\"/t/mid-term-review-agenda/6128/7\">above in this same thread</a>),\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Your presentation may tell\u00a0a story showcasing your work (points 1 and 6 above). Your story will most probably include elements on point 2. You should underline how your work and the way you carried it connects with point 5.</li>\n\n<li>Your story should provide indication about how you are using the EC money you were given (point 3). You may address this plainly at the end of the scientific part of your presentation.</li>\n\n<li>Your presentation should mention how your results achieve impact (cf report part A).</li>\n\n<li>Your presentation need not duplicate the report.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n--------------------\n\nWHAT FORMAT?\n\nA. INTRO\n\nAlberto and I will prepare an introduction to help reviewers adopt the right perspective on our project (20 - 30 minutes). I personally am unsure about how much they are into the CAPSSI spirit (remember one is software-engineering oriented, the other is into neurosciences and bio-informatics). After the intro is over, we may assume they got the big picture, context\u00a0and goals on which presenters can build.\n\nI suggest then that partners present in the following order, partly for logical reasons, partly because of timing constraints:\n\nB. PARTNER PREZ\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>City of Milano (20 + 10 minutes)</li>\n\n<li>WeMake\u00a0(20 + 10 minutes)</li>\n\n<li>SCIMPULSE\u00a0(20 + 10 minutes)</li>\n\n<li>EHFF\u00a0(20 + 10 minutes)</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n-- Lunch break --\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>UBx and ER will team up to give a two speaker presentation, reporting on ER's work itself, then explaining how network science is mobilized, providing information on ICT work by UBx; then presenting a use case to highlight how this technology is used and how it is useful.\u00a0(40 + 20 minutes)</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nOther partners may also prepare a joint presentation. I personally thought City of Milano maybe want to team with WeMake.\n\nC. CONCLUSION\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Project management (UBx, Luce and I, maybe go over the Open Call episode?)</li>\n\n<li>Project impact, goals acheived, future work (Alberto -- other want to stand up or bring items to the board? just say so)</li>\n\n</ul>", "created_at": "2017-03-02 11:54:07", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:52.429896", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 625, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25789, "user_id": 2551, "topic_id": 786, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>There will likely be a mobility focused co-design challenge </b>\n\n<a href=\"https://launchforth.io/localmotors/accessibleolli/handbook/\">here</a> soon.

Peer to peer. The ethos is that there isn't any point in waiting for someone else to solve the problems: if we don't build the solutions ourselves with our minds and bodies, they won't get built. Together we have managed to pull off ambitious projects like the\u00a0<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/82554988\" style=\"color: rgb(233, 92, 46);\">unMonastery</a>\u00a0and the\u00a0<a href=\"/economy-app\" style=\"color: rgb(233, 92, 46);\">Economy app</a>\u00a0with very little means. In doing so we have learned that we are one another's best resource.\n\n<h3>Get paid to connect awesome projects and connect people creating positive change.</h3>\n\n<strong>We're creating a Tour bringing together people doing inspiring things in Armenia, Egypt and Georgia with their peers from different parts of the world.</strong>\u00a0Rather than working in a top- down manner, we prefer it if people active on the local scene are involved in shaping the initiative from the beginning. The contents of the workshop in each country will be heavily based on the online discussion. So we are making a budget available to people who can help build engagement and drive participation in the online platform ahead of, during and after the tour. If you know of people doing interesting work in either of the three countries (maybe you are one of them), are active in the local scene as well as on social media and speak either Arabic, Armenian or Georgian you may be eligible for one of the paid work opportunities we publish in this group.\n\n<h3>Get paid for sharing information about inspiring projects.</h3>\n\n<strong>We are building a useful online knowledge resource, mutual support community and collaboration opportunities for and by change-makers.</strong>\u00a0After the tour, we envision the online contributions to be further developed into individual articles (2500 words), meant for publication in digital format for and by participants. As well as in the final deliverable to the UNDP. Each article selected for the final publication will be paid for*.\n\n<h3>Travel and meet other people doing awesome social projects.</h3>\n\n<strong>A number of selected contributors to the online conversation and local workshops of the tour will be invited to an international conference in Georgia, with their travel expenses covered by Edgeryders</strong>. The conference is a unique opportunity for people doing interesting work in your community to come together with peers from other parts of the world, inspire one another and help each other.\n\n<h3>Why now?</h3>\n\nWhile a few of us are in Central and South America, India and South Africa, most of the 1800+ community members are based in Europe.\u00a0<strong>We want to reach out to our peers in other parts of the world to explore how we can learn from and support one another's work. P2p. And we've built a nice opportunity to do so together with anyone and everyone who wants to be involved</strong>.\n\nBasically we made a compelling case that the UNDP should launch a so called \"foresight\" exercise in three countries modelled on the Edgeryders way of doing things...and they agreed!\u00a0The principle in Edgeryders is that the people who do the work call the shots: now is the perfect time to get involved in shaping this initiative as we are just getting started!\n\nYou can learn more about the actual initiative on the Edgeryders blog:\u00a0<a href=\"/groups/blog/edgeryders-helps-undp-spot-the-future-in-armenia-georgia-and-egypt\" style=\"color: rgb(233, 92, 46);\">https://edgeryders.eu/groups/blog/edgeryders-helps-undp-spot-the-future-in-armenia-georgia-and-egypt</a>\n\n<h3>How to start?</h3>\n\n<strong>The way it works is that you sign into the Edgeryders platform, join this group and leave a post below saying hello to the rest of the community and telling us a litte about yourself</strong>. This breaks the ice and makes it easier for everyone to start interacting with you as they know more about what you are interested in. It also makes it easier for us to get the word out about the paid opportunities to people who want to join us in building this movement together.\n\nWe hope you'll join us on this shared journey.

Belle m\u00e9taphore.\u00a0\n\nJe ne parle pas de mon enfance. La porte est ferm\u00e9e \u00e0 cl\u00e9 dans ma m\u00e9moire. Mais maintenant que tu abordes ce sujet, cela me fait songer au fait que mon p\u00e8re \u00e9tait aussi un passionn\u00e9 de la politique. C'\u00e9tait un sujet de discussion omnipr\u00e9sent.\n\nMerci beaucoup d'avoir partag\u00e9 ces information sur toi et ton cheminement. Cela permet de mieux comprendre ton engagement et les efforts que tu d\u00e9ploies pour que le gouvernement du Qu\u00e9bec marche vers une politique de gouvernement ouvert. Je souligne \u00e9galement tes esp\u00e9rances que se d\u00e9veloppe le gouvernement ouvert au sein de la Francophonie.\n\nCe bout de phrase que tu as indiqu\u00e9, 'mon passage en politique m'a fait perdre bien des id\u00e9aux', a retenu mon attention. Il est dommage que la politique fasse cela, qu'elle tue des choses auxquelles nous tenons, qu'elle \u00e9clabousse des r\u00eaves et qu'elle \u00e9teigne des feux de passion. Quelque part, ce n'est pas normal, il a quelque chose qui ne tourne pas rond. Pourquoi ce domaine-l\u00e0 en particulier s'av\u00e8re-t-il un \u00e9teignoir?\n\nLe gouvernement ouvert, pour moi, cela repr\u00e9sente des opportunit\u00e9s de co-production et de co-cr\u00e9ation avec les citoyens. Cela ne peut pas fonctionner si l'ambiance qui r\u00e8gne dans les \u00e9quipes, l'environnement, a tendance \u00e0 \u00e9teindre et faire perdre les id\u00e9aux. J'imagine tr\u00e8s difficilement comment ce genre d'environnement pourra arriver \u00e0 faire jaillir de la cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9.\n\nQuant \u00e0 la perte de confiance des citoyens envers leurs repr\u00e9sentants, cela me travaille aussi beaucoup l'esprit. Il est int\u00e9ressant d'apprendre que tu tiens particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 cela, parce que tu as fait l'exp\u00e9rience de ce que c'est lorsque cela n'est plus pr\u00e9sent. Au p\u00e9ril de ta vie. Cela me fait penser \u00e0 quand on se casse une jambe. On r\u00e9alise soudainement \u00e0 quel point cette jambe-l\u00e0 nous \u00e9tait utile, indispensable, et il faut d\u00e9ployer des efforts inouis de r\u00e9habilitation pour r\u00e9apprendre \u00e0 marcher. Jouer avec le feu de la perte de confiance des citoyens a des cons\u00e9quences.

Transforming patients (or their closest carers) into makers is an interesting perspective. We know from citizen science that this first hands involvement often offers a stimulus to personal studies, and reflection about the identity of the problem, and the problem holder. One could argue this is an even more important potential benefit than the access to the devices in itself.\n\nHowever, an important reflection should happen about quality and safety. If one cannot bring a simple solution to the market because of the iters for safety and quality certification, and this we agree is bad, the solution should not be \"ok, let's ignore this step and bypass it\".\n\nThere are a number of issues here. 1st and foremost, one has to describe how safety and quality are reasonably assured, and what safety net would be put in place should something still happen (although we know they are not perfect, to use an euphemism, today a number of tools and services exist to cover for assistance, accidents' costs, etc on the side of providers).\n\nOf course, one could ignore this. Depending on the IP scheme, no safety nets would be needed (although it would nice to think of them), for example. But this brings us to a second issue, one that\u00a0is almost\u00a0\"ethical\": transforming every patient in a maker can leverage the citizen-scientist effect only if (this is presented as\u00a0gut feeling here, but I am open to discuss it in depth later)\u00a0the right IP scheme is adopted. And only if radical openness is adopted one can truly claim no responsibility over the final \"accidents\" that will always happen (only that which does not work, will not break).\u00a0Should the creator preserve control of the IP for itself, one will always find a court that will consider the business model \"exploitative\", and enforce the order to establish the aforementioned safety nets (there is an interesting case about a fire happend in an AirBnB apartment that touches on this topic)... falling back to the problem one wanted to work around, just a bit later.\n\nSo, what would be the general ecosystem' services that would keep this garden grow orderly? I don't see this answered (that's not an easy one,\u00a0indeed)\n\nResearch, and \"citizen science\", target the pioneers and early adopters... To scale beyond that, we need to think the entire ecosystem, and be humble.\n\nFor the sake of our understanding, let me be pedant and allow me to stress that\u00a0disabilities do not exist in silos. People have many things going on in their lives, and around them, of course also the disabled ones. They do not stop living when they change status.\u00a0A few will want to pioneer, some will want to have new solutions, some others will not want any because... I am not sure they need a \"because\".\n\nI would like to not dig too deep in the question about why the current \"solutions\" are often not marketed/offered... just for the sake of reasoning together: if you had a clue about how to build an engine, and it would work once every 100 attempts after serious tinkering... would you be able to market it? Let's be honest with ourselves and remember that researchers are very optimistic people (I belong to the category, so this is self-criticism). They will produce proof of concepts, hardly ever demonstrators (although they usually confuse the terminology), and they don't normally ask themselves questions like \"how long will this work continuously?\", \"what will be the safety mechanism once it turns off, as instance because of battery exhaustion?\", how many scenarios are realistically recapitulated in the lab I used for the tests, and how well does this solution generalize?\",...\n\nLet's not dive in the argument of healthcare provision on this topic. Sometimes it is the right reflection to face, some other it is populistic... In these circumstances it reminds of the sentence I have recently read on twitter \"being poor means having too much end of the month\"... it may steal a smile, but it's a classic example of ill-posedness. You will not solve poverty by trying to shorten the calendar.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-08-08 10:37:26", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:10.585906", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 782, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11315, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 954, "post_number": 3, "raw": "We missed you, and yes you'll be there if we have to drag you :D\n\nSending hugs,\n\nNoemi", "created_at": "2012-12-19 13:34:24", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:05.364062", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 19, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [8342], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5676, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5643, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<strong>Update June 7th: this position has now been filled.

We explore the role played by communities in designing and providing care services. We do so in Edgeryders style, focusing on experiences rather than theory and encouraging open online conversation about the <a href=\"/op3ncare/helping-one-another-to-discover-what-is\">most interesting stories</a> that people share online. \n\nBut OpenCare has also a methodological twist. Our research on care has a double aim: on one hand we investigate community-provided care, on the other hand we aim to innovate on how social phenomena are investigated. Our Holy Grail is something we call Semantic Social Network Analysis (SSNA). The idea is to mix ethnography with networks science. Keywords (\"codes\" in ethnographic parlance) are assigned to contributions in an online conversation; next, a social network of that conversation is built. So far so good, we do this in <a href=\"/admin/edgesense/dashboard\">Edgesense</a>, but here's the curveball: thanks to the ethnography, now edges carry information about the <em>meaning</em> of interactions. With SSNA, we can: \n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Identify networks of keywords, and measure their cohesiveness.</li>\n\n<li>Identify emergent networks of specialists, who interact around specific keywords.</li>\n\n<li>Validate individual contributors. </li>\n\n</ul>\n\nWe are really excited about SSNA. We think this might be very, very relevant: a method of inquiry that works both on a small scale and on larger ones, that preserves the richness of open conversation but adds some hard quantitative measures. \n\n<strong>We are looking to hire one (or more?) ethnographers to collaborate with us on this project</strong>. This would run for about a year (June 2016-June 2017), on a part-time basis. We think it suits well graduate students, who might re-use the work for a thesis or papers (everything is open access in OpenCare), but we will consider any applicant. We have a total budget of about 14,400 Euro. Depending on candidates, we can either just hire one person or split it across 2-3 people. \n\n<strong>Skills</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Familiar with the theory and practice of ethnography.</li>\n\n<li>Comfortable with ethnography online.</li>\n\n<li>Good knowledge of English.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Tasks</strong>:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Build an ontology of relevant codes, appropriate to ethnographic coding of the online conversation.</li>\n\n<li>Do the actual coding, using a tool we built in-house called <a href=\"/t/open-ethnographer/578\">Open Ethnographer</a>. We estimate about 500 posts and 3,000 comments.</li>\n\n<li>Compile a short ethnographic report.</li>\n\n<li>Participate in the discussion towards improving both Open Ethnographer and the SSNA methodology.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nYou can do the work from wherever you are, but you will be requested to participate in one or more physical meetings. Your travel expenses for these meetings will be covered by Edgeryders.\n\n<strong>Workplace</strong>:\n\nWork online, from wherever you are. If you happen to be in Brussels, you can also come to the Edgespace, but that's not a requisite. Coordinate through the Edgeryders platform (we have a project group). At least one physical meeting, possibly more. Travel expenses covered. \n\n<strong>To apply</strong>: write to alberto [at] edgeryders [dot [eu].

That's when it all changed for me and a lot of the barriers I'd made for myself and a love for making came along.\n\nThe Pi, using a version of Linux, Raspian, which is based on Debian {which I'd worked with alongside my father} then meant I was able to hit the ground running and really get a kick out of IoT dev boards. I've participated in several of the Hackathons in one of Dublin's colleges, DCU and very much got the bug.\n\nI had a group of friends that had just started a Social Enterprise whereby they had gotten permission to take a brownfield site in the center of Dublin and then construct an 11 x 5 metre geodesic dome, in which they would both have a community space, while also having it be an intensive food producer by having an over head hydroponics system, controlled with IoT devices.\n\nI'd worked out an array of analogue sensors linked to an arduino, which would then feed their data over to a MYSQL database hosted on the raspberry pi. Then there was a website which would interpret and display that database onto a website hosted on the same pi.

Le ton sec et b\u00eate m'a pouss\u00e9e \u00e0 raccrocher sans plus tarder. \u00c0 quoi bon tenter de discuter <em>avec \u00e7a?</em> Prendre les citoyens pour des imb\u00e9ciles, des 2 watts, cela n'arrange pas les choses, pour voguer vers la 'collaboration' d'un gouvernement ouvert.\n\nIl a fallu que je me batte derni\u00e8rement avec des gestionnaires gouvernementaux, pour leur expliquer ce qu'est le concept d'\u00e9gal \u00e0 \u00e9gal. J'ai d\u00fb transmettre de longues lettres, \u00e9toff\u00e9es de nombreux exemples, o\u00f9 des citoyens (blogueurs) \u00e9taient invit\u00e9s par des gouvernements et trait\u00e9s en \u00e9gaux avec les journalistes, chefs de l'arm\u00e9e et ministres (encore l\u00e0, je demandais leur 'collaboration'). Finalement, mes longues lettres m'ont donn\u00e9 droit de m'assoir \u00e0 la droite du membre \u00e9lu du parlement. Sans toutefois avoir recours \u00e0 l'usage de la parole. Il m'aurait fallu r\u00e9diger d'autres lettres regorgeant d'argumentaire pour gagner ce privil\u00e8ge. Mais je manquais de temps, et surtout, <em>Y EN A MARRE </em>!!! Combien de lettres faut-il donc \u00e9crire, pour avoir droit \u00e0 un petit bout de quelque chose? J'\u00e9tais contente d'\u00eatre l\u00e0, mais je trouvais ma situation assez cocasse, vu les efforts d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s pour me retrouver sur la chaise en question. Cela g\u00e2che consid\u00e9rablement le plaisir de 'collaborer'. En plus d'appliquer beaucoup de stress chez les deux parties.\u00a0\n\nCe n'est pas cela, pour moi, une relation harmonieuse. Non, ce n'est pas du tout ainsi que j'entrevois la 'collaboration'. L'ambiance devrait \u00eatre toute autre.\n\nPar cons\u00e9quent, la <strong>dignit\u00e9</strong>, il s'agit d'un id\u00e9al \u00e0 atteindre, mais je consid\u00e8re que cela rel\u00e8ve quasiment de l'utopie, pour le moment. Nous sommes tr\u00e8s loin d'un gouvernement ouvert.\n\nD'autre part, les belles envol\u00e9es lyriques \u00e0 propos des nouvelles technologies me mettent franchement de mauvaise humeur. Cela devrait aller beaucoup plus loin qu'une plateforme, ou qu'un portail de donn\u00e9es ouvertes. Je pense qu'il s'agit d'une <strong>philosophie</strong>. Par cons\u00e9quent, je consid\u00e8re que cela devrait s'\u00e9tendre jusque dans les PENS\u00c9ES des dirigeants et des gestionnaires. Sans doute que je r\u00eave en couleurs...\n\nPersonne ne sait ce qu'est vraiment le gouvernement ouvert. Il est bon de nous le rappeler.\n\nNous commen\u00e7ons \u00e0 savoir <em>ce dont nous ne voulons plus. </em>C'est un bon d\u00e9part. Comment faire pour s'en d\u00e9barasser? <em>Alors l\u00e0! </em>\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-13 20:22:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:53.488979", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 961, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28757, "user_id": 31, "topic_id": 1662, "post_number": 19, "raw": "<b>thinking hard ...</b>\n\n... about it, Nadia, and thanks for asking!\n\nThere's this tendency to assume knowledge needed for this challenge is specialised.

(It all started with a discussion with Alberto <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/spotlight-open-government/mission_case/how-openly-govern-edgeryders#comment-1942\">over here</a>, and we're continuing here to let you all find it and contribute.)\n\nIt started with finding out about just how ethnographic research will be done on the Edgeryder project's data, and that this also includes the intention of releasing the complete package of mission reports, comments, ethnographic annotations and social network graphs to the public as \"open data\" [<a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/spotlight-open-government/mission_case/how-openly-govern-edgeryders#comment-1942\">source</a>]. That raises some concerns, and Alberto proposed that this merits a discussion with all of us here ...\n\n<em>I'm just doing copy &amp; paste of my original post for now, will polish it later:</em>\n\nI do like the Edgeryders project and its potential for bringing change in Europe, yet I was quite ... surprised, to say the least, to find out about the actual mode of research and data handling. In my view, Edgeryders raises some very novel issues of how to handle data dumps that include semantic data that's manually annotated to open content.\n\nI can't pinpoint it exactly so far, but I'd say that it's a conflict between open content and open data. The two are not the same. Data is ordered, orchestrated, annotated content, stuff from which new data can be derived by <em>automated</em> means. There have been hardly issues about that difference so far (to my knowledge) ... but Edgeryders is on the cutting edge of that with this ethno software thingy and by providing open data dumps of CC-BY licenced material which was semantically annotated afterwards. So we better look at these issues now before it's too late ...\n\nThe core of the problem is that a raw, open data style dump of the ethno-annotated Edgeryders content is far from everything happening with Creative Commons licenced content usually. (I'd even say it's far from everything the licence creators had in mind; else there might be a CC-BY-NM (\"no mining\") licence perhaps.) Such a dump enables unforseen uses. The Edgeryders data is special data, as it comes from social interactions, so naturally allows to easily identify most of the people who contributed (even when there are no names anymore; but people often refer to their projects etc., as is natural in social talk and encouraged on Edgeryders, so just use Google). It is even more special because of the added ethno annotations (whatever these are). Ethno annotations and personal identification might allow malign uses never imagined when writing the content. Examples? \"Find me all people who did post in Spanish at least once, whose political ideas are considered anticapitalist and commons oriented and who mention any affiliation with a Spain based organization and who consider themselves as leader types.\" (Cf. the Edgeryders tribal signs ...). Might come in handy as preemptive measure against Occupy style movements in Spain this year ... see <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/9198496/Spain-accused-of-draconian-plans-to-clamp-down-on-protests.html\">what they had in mind</a> already. The Edgeryders user base is too small for that, but ... you get the idea.\n\nThe reason why this issue does not evolve normally with CC-BY licenced content is that usually, no person has the time to do these ethno annotations and to provide the data in a nice, structured database for download. The moment that natural language understanding by computers arrives, or that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_linguistics#Author_identification\">forensic linguistics</a> matures, this will be all different and we will need to develop new open content licences, and linguistic obfuscation software. But for now, Edgeryders is pretty much alone with this issue.\n\nPlease don't get me wrong: I am not against open content. Not at all, I am an avid fan of all things open. I have several thousand pages of stuff on my page, all licenced CC-BY. And I've never had a problem. But that's because (1) I can avoid most potential problems by being in control of the data, requesting attribution to a pseudonym, and taking them down or even moving the site when needed, (2) the data is not structured and nobody has the time to structure / annotate it, so it's pretty forseeable what will be done with this data and what not. I don't release structured data about me in any way on the Internet; so for example, I have only very very basic and / or wrong stuff in my Facebook profile, I use ad blocking and track-me-not software on the web, I don't indicate my interests to Facebook by clicking any \"Like\" for a corporate page etc.. But I've no issue at all with releasing unstructured open content, as it is for human use only, not fit for automated processing. (Normally, until this present issue with Edgeryders where the structure / semantic annotations will be added afterwards by a third party.)\n\nThis type of managing my content is in line with my personal \"privacy policy\" that I settled on after quite a bit of consideration. There are three levels in it: content that I allow search engines to connect to my real-world identity, content that I allow law enforcement to do so, and content that I allow nobody to do so. (Note that this level three is completely empty and I don't need it currently; but I know the toolchain, and people under repressive regimes need it right now.) Content that I have complete control of (like on an own website) is on level one. Edgeryders content is at level two.\n\nHowever my privacy policy seems to have a hole in it, and I realize it only now because of the Edgeryders project. There has to be a new level (between 1 and 2) for content that I allow curious members of the public or of the research community to connect to my real-world identity by means of manual work. Did not run into this before - it was a complete no-issue so far ... . Content in this new level would be something where I am still happy if people connect it to my real-world identity by \"spying\" on me (or in other use cases, doing research on me). I doubt that Edgeryders would've made it into this level.\n\nThis data handling issue leads to another, and I think there has to be a clearer position here. On the one hand, Edgeryders is a playful platform that promotes social interaction in a cohesive community. There is also this upcoming conference, and we're treated as subjects with ideas and opinions to contribute there. Such a social setting naturally means that people talk about stuff and give hints to personal facts that they would not be happy to find again as structured data in a public database where you can run all kinds of queries on. On the other hand, just that seems to happen. By means of this ethno-annotation thing, we as users are treated in quite objectified manner, no longer as subjects, as peers. But if we are supposed to be in a lab setting for scientific observation, it would be better to introduce people right away to that idea when they sign up (just \"used for research\" is quite vague). There will be people who are available for this, esp. when adding anonymization tech to the platform. Or even simpler, do the ethno annotation in all the forums etc. where the Edgeryders topics have been discussed already. So in all I'd propose to either let us be subjects or objects, but this mixed state is the strangest online environment that I have been in so far. Does not feel good.\n\nSome practical proposals to discuss:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Clearly indicate what uses you will authorize for the open data dump of the open content entered into the Edgeryders site. Esp. please point out in the site's <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/page/legals\">Legals</a> what this ethno annotation software is that you use and what it can do and what people can potentially do with the data created that way.</li>\n\n<li>Discuss if you really want to do this <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_notebook_science\">open notebook science</a> approach for the Edgeryders project, that is, providing a full, ethno annotated database dump for third party research efforts. This is data about still identifiable persons (even with names removed), not about the weather, water temperature or that kinda trivia.</li>\n\n<li>Give us a two week \"content freeze\" period near the end of the project, to look through the data we provided and to delete or adapt everything we don't want to be retrievable as structured data. This means that all content has to be editable, including comments that have replies.</li>\n\n<li>Make a user's profile page restrictively licenced by the author. The one place without a right to reuse the info on there, so we could easily share more personal info on there without worrying what will become out of it. Such a change seems needed to retain the social-network type character of Edgeryders, actually the basis of its success.</li>\n\n<li>Provide an option to the user to allow and disallow search engines to retrieve the info on the profile page. (This esp. has to include the profile image because, mind you, face recognition is deployed already.)</li>\n\n<li>Provide a field in the user profile to identify just how CC-BY attribution should happen on reuse. The CC-BY licence mandates that the author has a say over how he wants to be attributed, and I usually request that people attribute to my pseudonymous name when sharing things CC-BY. (That way, I can still break the link to my person by removing the complete website where I published the material.)</li>\n\n<li>Show a link to this attribution requirement details on every piece of content throughout the Edgeryders website.</li>\n\n</ul>Your input on this, fellows?

It is built from the ground up to provide individuals and community organizations with an alternative to State- and corporate-run emergency response infrastructures, such as making a 112 or 911 phone call in Europe or the Sates. It offers a flexible and customizable, intake, dispatch, and <a href=\"https://github.com/betterangels/buoy/wiki/Feature-list\">field support toolkit</a> for coordinating collective action in the event of crises, whether large or small.\n\nUsing a smartphone or laptop computer, a community member can assemble one or more crisis support Teams, alert their support Team(s) of where they are and what they need by pressing a single button, and communicate in real-time with their support Team. Importantly, Team members can also coordinate with one another, independent of any communication from the person in crisis.\n\nBuoy is developed by a growing group of anti-capitalist, anti-racist, prison abolitionists calling themselves the <a href=\"https://betterangels.github.io/\">Better Angels. </a>We formed in the wake of the Occupy Wall Street protests in the United States, but are more inspired by movements of militant resistance against capitalist and nationalist domination such as the Zapatistas, and Rojavan Kurds abroad, and Black Lives Matter evictions of police occupation domestically.\n\nMany people are engaged in parallel efforts to both abolish racist systems of social control such as police and simultaneously supplant them with new systems and structures that genuinely serve a community's needs. As technologists, we recognize that <a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/10/the_battle_for_1.html\">technological advancement amplifies all existing power</a>, which is why we focus technical development efforts to support pre-existing activist and community organization processes, rather than imposing new protocols or procedures. This also means we recognize that Buoy is useless for an individual without a pre-existing social support group, whether that be a Church group, family, or activist collective willing to use the tools together.\n\nFor this reason, <a href=\"https://github.com/betterangels/buoy/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#implementation-choices\">Buoy is built so that it can be easily added to an existing community's social service infrastructure</a>. Rather than embarking on creating new services, caregiving groups can add Buoy as a layer atop their existing websites. So Buoy is not a traditional \"app\" that users download in the app store, but rather a means of adding crisis response, emergency dispatch, and coordination tools to the repertoire of any organization already providing caregiving support to their membership.\n\nInherent in this design is a decentralized architecture that more closely mirrors the way real-life social networks and grassroots organizations are dispersed. On a technological level, it's also a practical return to the earlier days of the Internet before massive, centralized corporate services dominated the landscape of cyberspace. Nevertheless, Buoy makes use of state of the art mobile technology to provide highly accurate GPS-enabled mapping, live video, and other real-time communication tools that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-XlyB_QQYs\">in many cases far exceed the meager capabilities of traditional State-run \"First Responder\" services</a>. And we do it using strictly free software that adds no additional burden to a group's budget.\n\nExperience has demonstrated that there already exist <a href=\"https://undercoverinfo.wordpress.com/2016/08/06/greece-more-and-more-anarchist-refugee-collectives-displace-state-run-detention-centres/\">a vast array</a> of <a href=\"https://joindiaspora.com/p/7702902\">functioning alternatives to State-run care giving institutions</a> and crisis response services. Moreover, <a href=\"https://talkpoverty.org/2016/03/10/when-low-income-mothers-call-the-police/\">for the vast majority of issues that people rely on State-run emergency services for, the State's responses do more harm than good</a>. In contrast, community-run services staffed by the friends and peers of people in need provide a quality of care far superior to <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2016/8/3/when_you_dial_911_and_wall\">the level of care provided by similarly-tasked State or corporate employees</a>. This is most obvious in the case of calling 911 in the United States for issues such as \"noise disturbances,\" which <a href=\"https://github.com/betterangels/buoy/wiki/Relevant-current-events\">too often end in the murder of a marginalized person at the hands of a police officer</a>.\n\nEnding such horrors requires, in part, providing ubiquitous access to equally-usable alternatives to existing corporate-State partnerships. Much of this alternative infrastructure already exists in certain areas, in the form of community health clinics and volunteer collectives. But one piece these groups are still missing is the technical \"last mile\" that connects community members in need with the resources that their community's already-existing volunteer services provide when and where they need it.\n\nThat's where Buoy fits in.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-08-15 00:29:20", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 10:53:05.248909", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 860, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 237.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31198, "user_id": 10, "topic_id": 1519, "post_number": 56, "raw": "<b>Absolutely Nothing!</b>\n\nI've followed the discussion thread so far and it is splendid. Well grounded opinions, daring affirmations, interesting debates. There are several pointes that I also wanted to add to it. First of all, after reading through Vinay's post and through the comments I have this slight feeling of Euro-centrism concentrated in here\n\nThere are so many potentially dangerous/destructive things going on in the world right now.\u00a0 I will outline just a few examples. China has announced a double-digit increase in military spending in March while India recently became the world's number one arms importer. This triggered reactions in neighboring Pakistan, test-launching their new missiles. North Korea is going \u2018bunkers\u2019 after its failed rocket launch. Let\u2019s not mention the growing tension around Iran and the continuing bloodbath in Syria. This all go on top of unending tension, violence, insecurity and underdevelopment in Africa (the current hot-spots being Nigeria, Sudan and South Sudan, Kenya and the Mombasa region, Mali and the Tuaregs among many others)\n\nIf Europeans are so concerned about irregular migration, and the growing inflow of asylum seekers, security at the EU borders, multiculturalism and culture and identity issues, I think they should also be concerned about <strong><em>Detecting, Avoiding, Mitigating</em> and helping others <em>Recover</em> from violent conflict.</strong>\n\nI think war is a deplorable thing. It doesn\u2019t matter where, when or by whom it is waged, any form of violence should be condemned and stopped. Therefore, I think that the (potential) war in Europe is important and should be dealt with preemptively, by building the necessary capacities and infrastructures for prevention, early-warning mechanisms, \u2018hard\u2019 resilience tactics, and peacebuilding strategies. BUT the war in Europe should not be treated or perceived as being more important than the current crises going on in the world, be it Africa, Asia or the Americas.\n\nI also thought that if we really want to look for resilience models, we might as just take Iraqis, Pakistanis or citizens of Afghanistan as examples, the very people that the Europeans (Westerners) are waging wars against.\n\nI don't think that the M.A.D. doctrine is dead. I believe Europeans will do everything in their power to avoid a war within their borders as a defense mechanism againt the other world powers. I just wish that every conscious man, every politician, every military commander has read Kropotkin's <a href=\"http://www.complementarycurrency.org/ccLibrary/Mutual_Aid-A_Factor_of_Evolution-Peter_Kropotkin.pdf\"><em>Mutual Aid</em></a> [full book in pdf format] to undestand that cooperation is a stronger and more desirable factor of evolution than competition.\n\nEvery conflict is born equal, should be treated with equal respect to the matter and with equal dedication to the cause of making and maintaining peace and triggering socio-economic development.\n\nNow, resilience is a great thing and we need more of it in the world. I hope I understood it correctly and I would like to connect it with a very similar (new wave) concept called I4P [Infrastructures for Peace]. There is an international core group of researchers, activists and experts working on developing the concept and giving it shape and structure. <a href=\"gallery.mailchimp.com/6a680fb7b07a3d5200916c864/files/I4P_Letter_K._Brand_Jacobsen.docx\">Here\u2019s a 2-pager</a> concept note on the I4P. And here you can find the laterst issue of the <a href=\"http://us2.campaign-archive1.com/?u=6a680fb7b07a3d5200916c864&amp;id=b9868e6066&amp;e=ea6f6e8270\">Peace Praxis newsletter</a> sent out by the PATRIR (Romanian Institute for Peace), where I volunteer at, with a special focus on I4P with key info and publications attached.\n\nHope you guys enjoy it. If this is of interest to you, I could also prepare a 10-15 minute presentation on the Infrastructures for Peace, say during the breakout session on Resilience or during the unconference. Keep in touch and looking forward to interesting discussions at the conference.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-28 18:08:40", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:51.634768", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 682, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24050, "user_id": 1443, "topic_id": 1197, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>We've been talking about similar things...</b>\n\nat the Free Knowledge Institute.\u00a0 For instance, the idea of developing a free alternative to current popular Software as a Service offerings.\n\nAnd also, the connected idea of \"the business case.\"\u00a0 The \"temptations\" of using non-free software would be less if the cost/benefit analysis came down squarely in favor of free software.\u00a0 Can we use free software and other free/open approaches to help create new and compelling revenue-generating possibilities?\u00a0 (Or other less-businessy benefits...)\n\n", "created_at": "2013-08-06 09:27:16", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:13.315032", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 95, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27536, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1274, "post_number": 20, "raw": "<b>Makes sense!</b>\n\nAndrea's point makes a lot of sense though.

For most of human history, innovation has been an activity of last resort, to be undertaken only when the old ways could not possibly be maintained.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-19 16:34:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:32.076238", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 83, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [11488], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6598, "user_id": 3067, "topic_id": 5236, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Sorry to hear, I'd been looking forward to the 'walkshop'", "created_at": "2016-02-08 15:07:46", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:38.734439", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 11, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5976, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 5943, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<h2 class=\"content-section\">The Next Year: Concept, Pitch and Plans</h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">Concept: The Reef</h3>\n\n<strong>Using Coral Reefs as a model, Edgeryders\u00a0proposes <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/can-politics-collaborative-nadia-el-imam\">a new kind of connective layer as an enabler of social and political renewal</a>.

The 31 scientists who signed this paper demonstrated that the number of deaths was 15 times higher than what was announced in official press releases of governments.\n\nI spent four years repeating like a parrot that the official data was wrong.

Why is that? Because we feel insecure and threatened by such thoughts? Because we're not very good, in general, with long term planning?\n\nBut there is more: PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO LOOK AT REALITY when a catastrophe occurs. The real numbers get camouflaged. This happens for a number of reasons. The main reason is that governments do not want the population to PANIC.

No matter how good the plan is, if there is no strategy to <span><span>neutralize</span> <span>the fear of the (possible) panic</span></span>, the success of implementing the plan might fail. Citizens, will they really panic? On what parameters is the fear of governments really based. How do citizens really behave, when an emergency situation occurs. What do citizens do? To what extent is there solidarity emerging? What is the contribution of citizens, how many new ways and ideas emerge from citizens' end.\n\n<span><span>During the 2009 pandemic</span><span>,</span> <span>it was declared</span> <span>that the deaths</span> <span>were</span> <span>caused</span> <span>mainly</span> <span>among people</span> <span>65 and older</span><span>.</span> <span>(While</span> <span>any</span> <span>Flubie</span> <span>knew that</span> <span>this would not be</span> <span>the case</span><span>.</span></span>)<span><span> We should look</span> <span>carefully</span>, <span>in addition to</span> <span>the list of</span> <span>basic medicines</span><span>,</span> <span>to which proportions of the population are</span> <span>at risk</span><span>,</span> <span>by disease type</span><span>, or by various other factors. </span></span>\n\n<span><span>As is done</span> <span>for vaccine distribution</span><span>,</span> <span>in</span> <span>very severe</span> <span>pandemic scenarios</span><span>, one should also</span> <span>consider the possibility of</span> <span>priorities</span><span> </span></span><span><span>in</span> <span>the intervention</span> <span>and care</span><span>.</span></span>\n\n<span><span>As</span> <span>in the scenarios</span> <span>of a major disaster</span><span>, </span><span>the number of</span> <span>deaths</span><span> should be estimated. </span></span><span><span>A </span><span>graduated scale</span><span>,</span> <span>corresponding to the different degrees</span> <span>of</span> <span>disaster</span><span>.

N\u00e9anmoins, il est possible de r\u00e9sister au formatage et de fa\u00e7onner sa propre existence en modelant des r\u00e9alit\u00e9s enrichies.\n\nDe nouveaux niveaux de\u00a0 conscience semblent \u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019origine d\u2019une \u00e9volution des mentalit\u00e9s. La cr\u00e9ation de nouveaux discours apporte une perception nouvelle des effets de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 et m\u00e8ne vers une dynamique de changement et de renouvellement. Cette \u00e9volution permet \u00e0 l\u2019homme de s\u2019analyser et donc de poser un regard critique sur son fonctionnement et sur\u00a0 les \u00e9l\u00e9ments d\u00e9terminant la survie ou la remise en cause d\u2019un syst\u00e8me quelconque (crise financi\u00e8re actuelle par exemple). Ce sont ces circonstances qui permettent l\u2019apparition de nouveaux sch\u00e9mas.\n\nCe ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne engendre des cons\u00e9quences qui doivent \u00eatre analys\u00e9es en tenant compte de la responsabilit\u00e9 de chaque individu comme acteur dans le processus de mutation. Nous assistons \u00e0 une \u00e9volution substantielle des innovations technologiques.\u00a0 La technologie a un effet exponentiel dans la cr\u00e9ation de nouvelles tendances.\u00a0 Elle nous fournit une rang\u00e9e d'outils qui r\u00e9duisent le temps et l'espace en nous aidant \u00e0 cr\u00e9er de nouvelles r\u00e9alit\u00e9s plus rapidement.\u00a0 En cons\u00e9quence, les r\u00e9sultats apparaissent plus t\u00f4t, nous menant cependant toujours dans directions diff\u00e9rentes et parfois inconnues.\u00a0 Si notre cr\u00e9ation est utile dans un sens positif, avec l'effet exponentiel de la technologie nous construirons de meilleures r\u00e9alit\u00e9s, autrement nous pouvons aussi provoquer des effets non d\u00e9sir\u00e9s.\n\nNous constatons par exemple que si bien nos technologies et notre environnement changent de plus en plus rapidement nos r\u00e9flexes, nos habitudes et nos cultures risquent de se trouver de plus en plus d\u00e9cal\u00e9s par rapport \u00e0 cette r\u00e9alit\u00e9 en mouvement. Les effets potentiellement d\u00e9vastateurs du d\u00e9calage culturel (ou social) entre choc technologique et r\u00e9ponse rationnelle sont bien connus: voir par exemple la r\u00e9duction du taux de fertilit\u00e9 apr\u00e8s la chute de la mortalit\u00e9 enfantine. Le d\u00e9calage aura caus\u00e9 une \"explosion\" d\u00e9mographique.\n\nDe plus, les d\u00e9couvertes scientifiques des derniers si\u00e8cles ont boulevers\u00e9 notre model mental de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9: Copernic, Galil\u00e9e, Newton, Darwin, Einstein, Hawkins, etc. Les inventions ont r\u00e9volutionn\u00e9 notre mobilit\u00e9, notre communication, la quantit\u00e9 d'information \u00e0 notre disposition. La question se pose donc si nous sommes suffisamment \u00e9quip\u00e9s, culturellement et moralement, pour face \u00e0 une r\u00e9alit\u00e9 qui \u00e9volue plus rapidement que nos meurs. Quels sont les points fixes, les rep\u00e8res, qui vont nous permettre de nous orienter\u00a0; amour et Paix?\n\nSi un nouveau monde \u00e9tait \u00e0 inventer face \u00e0 une panne de civilisation, comme pourrions-nous\u00a0 r\u00e9inventer le tout \u00e0 partir de nos savoirs hypersp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s d\u2019aujourd\u2019hui\u00a0?\n\nLe terme central est plateforme.

Notre projet est de faciliter ce lien.\n\nLe futur est d\u00e9j\u00e0 l\u00e0 mais d\u2019une fa\u00e7on in\u00e9gale. Comment aujourd\u2019hui, imagine-t-on demain\u00a0?

Pr\u00e9parer les prochaines g\u00e9n\u00e9rations \u00e0 savoir vivre le changement, le comprendre, d'y participer et de ne pas le subir. \u00a0Nous apporterons des outils originaux pour une pratique de l'existence \u00a0afin d\u2019apprendre \u00e0 vivre heureux tous les jours.\n\nNous chercherons \u00e0 faire \u00e9merger des nouveaux niveaux de\u00a0 conscience individuelle et collective qui permettront la cr\u00e9ation de discours am\u00e9lior\u00e9s en formant des r\u00e9alit\u00e9s personnelles et institutionnelles plus enrichies. Nous formerons des visionnaires capables de contribuer \u00e0 modifier de fa\u00e7on directe ou indirecte les nouveaux sch\u00e9mas qui se d\u00e9signent. Nous d\u00e9montrerons que lorsque l\u2019on change une partie d\u2019un tout, si infime soit-elle, on en modifie toute une structure. En le faisant, nous contribuerons mutuellement \u00e0 notre propre \u00e9volution et celle des autres.\n\nO\u00f9, quand, comment, avec quoi\u00a0?\n\nLe terrain de jeu : toute l\u2019existence\n\nLe bon moment : l\u2019instant pr\u00e9sent, ici-maintenant\n\nL\u2019\u00e9nergie pour le faire : l\u2019authenticit\u00e9 de l\u2019inconscient\n\nLes outils pour le faire :\u00a0\u00a0 attentions, intuition et pr\u00e9cision\n\n\u00a0\n\nEnseignements\u00a0:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>ECUTO: Evolution de la conscience dans compr\u00e9hension et transformation des organisations</li>\n\n<li>L\u2019Art de la Strat\u00e9gie\u00a0: penser autrement\u00a0: \u2018R\u00e9ussir\u2019\u00a0 par l\u2019absence d\u2019\u2018\u00e9chec\u2019</li>\n\n<li>L\u2019Ecole du Clown Invisible\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>L\u2019enseignement de la non-souffrance\u00a0: la pratique de l\u2019Ego-responsabilit\u00e9</li>\n\n<li>L\u2019entra\u00eenement du Calme Mental\u00a0: pacifier l\u2019Esprit, d\u00e9velopper la Vision P\u00e9n\u00e9trante</li>\n\n<li>La Formation Contr\u00f4le Management\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>La Ma\u00eetrise du Langage Courant\u00a0: Applications de la S\u00e9mantique G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</li>\n\n<li>Les Ateliers Prospectifs, n\u00e9s d\u2019une conviction: le discours apocalyptique, le discours du d\u00e9sastre, n\u2019est pas seulement \u00e9nervant,\u00a0 il est faux.\u00a0 Nous ne vivons pas un d\u00e9sastre, mais une mutation.</li>\n\n<li>R\u00e9duire les situations de conflit et de d\u00e9g\u00e2t des entreprises</li>\n\n<li>R\u00e9flexion sur\u00a0 l'Identit\u00e9 Universelle: l'internationalisation et le m\u00e9tissage des cultures, des traditions et des religions.</li>\n\n<li>SuBr\u00e9alisme\u00a0: saisir la r\u00e9lait\u00e9 en faisant appel \u00e0 l\u2019intuition, la raison et le r\u00eave</li>\n\n</ol>", "created_at": "2012-04-15 18:49:25", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:05.799448", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1106, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [11073], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22090, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1357, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Dragon</b>\n\nL'ann\u00e9e du Dragon! \u00c7a c'est cool...

The answer to the conundrum is not to be found in the same isolation and analysis of the 'issues', this is about root causes, and the root cause seems to be the isolation that people experience in youth by virtue of the formal and pointedly patriarchal institutions we have developed. There are many ways in which the problems this one sidedness can manifest, the need for significance in the face on non recognition can lead to bullying (violence being the fast track to significance) ; isolation and despair and no encouragement toward personal communication lead to empathic shut down and suicide in worst case scenarios, lack of connection to welcoming and mutually involved communities leads to drug abuse (false sense of union)  and youth pregnancy; and the psychology of self harm shows the act as an inwardly directed response to injustice experienced outside a person and beyond their control, the needs to effect the appropriate response is fulfilled against the self.\n\nI like what Nadia just did posting that comment, it's too easy to dismiss such honesty and underlaying wisdom with facile judgement, and this in itself, what we have learned to do so easily in the west. Today an article was released outlining how a lobby group of well respected ( predominantly male) scientists have advised the Australian universities to do away with courses in 'alternative medicine'. I spent three years in European hospitals undergoing multiple surgeries and eating up to 23 pills per day, I asked if my digestive disorder may have something to d with nutrition and my diet and I was told- \"that is alternative medicine, we don't do that here\" , later I experienced a full healing in India with an Ayurvedic doctor in two months using dietary awareness and herbal mixtures. The patriarchal analysis and insistence on demonstrable proof is very very harmful, it ignores the effects of emotions, the intuitive process, the instance of consciousness, and the way in which we are collectively fucking up each others lives and the world by our western patriarchal hubris. \n\nNadia and Elf are on track here...Let's engage with this, not as 'experts' , but as human beings.", "created_at": "2012-07-20 16:31:16", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:40.651289", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 384, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10995, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 2903, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>works for me.</b>\n\nWe need to make call to action very clear though.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-05-04 21:14:53", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:03.395703", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 17, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [9642], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28356, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 5658, "post_number": 12, "raw": "<b>Waiting for the last stragglers to do this once</b>\n\n@Rossana_Torri? @Luciascopelliti @Lakomaa @Tino_Sanandaji @markomanka?\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-06-06 10:10:24", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:36.294862", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 19, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11199, "user_id": 1639, "topic_id": 2746, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Thanks!</b>\n\nSounds good.
