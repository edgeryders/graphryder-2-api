This is how events start in Nepal :-)</span>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\t\t\t<span>Registration, Name Cards and CJ Kits.</span><span> Let people create their own name tags from colored paper, pens etc. which will be provided. Takes a bit of time, which is good for a smooth slow start. People also get their CJ kit at registration.</span></li>\n\n<li>\t\t\t\t<span>Discussing citizen journalism. </span><span>A discussion led by Annu and Dipti, starting with interesting quotes on citizeny journalism which are to be prepared by participants before the workshop.</span></li>\n\n<li>\t\t\t\t<span><strong>Twitter storytelling.</strong> A creative writing session using tweets. Led by Natalia.</span></li>\n\n<li>\t\t\t\t<span><strong>Things to tell at the official start.</strong> Tell people that the content they produce is open content (if they publish it on edgeryders.eu, which we encourage them to do). Also tell them that if they like the workshop format, they might want to organize more of them. The \u201cFuture Makers Nepal\u201d and \u201cEdgeryders\u201d brands are open to be used for that :-)</span></li>\n\n</ul></li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><strong>Sessions.</strong> </span>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\t\t\t<span>Record Nepal. </span><span>See <a href=\"http://recordnepal.com/\">recordnepal.com</a>. In Dipti\u2019s opinion, the Record is one of the pioneer alternative media / citizen journalism media in Nepal. The session will be held by Gyanu Adhikari, the editor of the Record. He will share his experiences on Record Nepal, and the earthquake. [Print/Online]</span></li>\n\n<li>\t\t\t\t<span><span><strong>KathaHaru+Amuse.</strong> This is a </span>team of photographers and videographers who shot a documentary on the earthquake. The session will be held <span> by Shashank Shrestha, Suyog Shrestha, and Rocky Prajapati on video journalism and its ethics. [Visual: Video+Photography]</span></span></li>\n\n<li>\t\t\t\t<span><strong>Kathmandu Living Labs.</strong> Would be great to have them for a session on open data / data journalism. Unfortunately, they were not available.</span></li>\n\n</ul></li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><strong>Article writing.</strong> Encourage people to write short texts, not overdoing it. The goal is to have an article up on edgeryders.eu by the end of the session.</span></li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><strong>Publishing the articles.</strong> Preferably on the Edgeryders platform, obviously.</span></li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><strong>Reading and discussion session.</strong> Could be organized as a paired critique or plenum session for P2P feedback.</span></li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><strong>Documentary screening.</strong> Planned for the evening, after the end of the official program.</span> <span>The key screening in the evening could be a documentary that is relevant for citizen journalism. Like \"Citizen Four\", if we can get the screening rights in time ;-)</span></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">Other organizational aspects and tasks</h2>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>Logistics tasks.</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Choose a title for the event.</strong> Done: WRITERS\u2019 WORKSHOP: NARRATIVES OF THE QUAKE 2015</li>\n\n<li><strong>Create a Facebook event and Edgeryders event.</strong> Done.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Decide on a venue.</strong> Done: Cafe Aamu.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Get a projector and screen.</strong> We will probably need a projector and a screen if we want to screen these documentaries. Done.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Food, snacks and drinks.</strong> Done.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Stationery: papers, post-it notes etc..</strong> Done.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Extension cords and multi-plug power strips.</strong> Done.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Putting the citizen journalism kits together.</strong> Done.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Providing four laptops from the team for those who don\u2019t have one.</strong> Done.</li>\n\n</ul></li>\n\n<li><strong>Everyone, learn the basics.</strong> The team needs to know the basics of citizen journalism before the workshop, of course.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Send a reading list around.</strong> Prepare a database of articles that we will share with participants. It would be open to additions by the participants. Was shared by mailing a link to a Google Drive folder around.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Small inspirational documentaries.</strong> Every now and then we could screen small inspirational documentaries during the day. Did not happen in the end though.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Citizen Journalism Toolkits.</strong> We ask for 35 items in stocks, and buy them once it\u2019s clear how many participants confirmed they are coming. Ingredients:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bhavproducts\">Bhav</a> notebook. 220 NPR / piece.</li>\n\n<li><strong>A good pen.</strong> 83 NPR / piece.</li>\n\n<li>Edgeryders and Future Makers Nepal badges and / or stickers</li>\n\n<li>Citizen Journalism badges and / or stickers (possibly)</li>\n\n<li><strong>A tote bag.</strong> We chose <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/nepalpicturelibrary/posts/857001094361880:0\">the bag from Nepal Picture Library</a>, allowing us to add the Future Makers Logo as well.</li>\n\n</ul></li>\n\n<li><strong>Documentation.</strong> We will have the write-ups by participants online at the end of the day. We can record the two or three sessions on video (plus some shots of the audience etc.). Plus, one of the team can do a post with reflections on the format afterwards. No need to take notes over the day.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Budget.</strong> This is the effective budget we used for the event.\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>Citizen Journalism Toolkits.</strong> Around 28.700 NPR (excl. stickers).</li>\n\n<li><strong>Stickers / Badges.</strong> 100 pieces, 3500 NPR in total.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Room compensation.</strong> 8500 NPR.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Cook wage.</strong> 4000 NPR.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Food ingredients for dinner.</strong> Around 6000 NPR.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Snacks.</strong> Around 3000 NPR.</li>\n\n</ol></li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">Annotated Program</h2>\n\n<strong>Time on the Invitation:</strong> 10 am\n\n<strong>Official Start Time:</strong> 11 am\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:0pt;\">\n\n<table style=\"border:none;border-collapse:collapse\">\n\n<colgroup>\n\n<col width=\"36\">\n\n<col width=\"174\">\n\n<col width=\"143\">\n\n<col width=\"91\">\n\n<col width=\"96\">\n\n<col width=\"139\">\n\n</colgroup>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr style=\"height:0px\">\n\n<td style=\"border-left:solid \\#000000 1px;border-right:solid \\#000000 1px;border-bottom:solid \\#000000 1px;border-top:solid \\#000000 1px;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\n\n<span>S.

People in Edgeryders might be involved in both, but the company (as I see it) focuses on doing the latter.\u00a0\n\nLet me explain. I'll start by making a list of ongoing collaborations across people in Edgeryders. There is no repository, but just off the top of my head:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Ben, Gaia, Anthony and I have tried (unsuccessfully, for now) to get a research project off the ground.</li>\n\n<li>Gaia and Anthony are collaborating around an offline social network analysis project.</li>\n\n<li>Elf and Max are involved in organizing\u00a0OuiShare in Paris. So is Nadia, as speaker.</li>\n\n<li>Pietro Speroni and Smari are cooking up something around network politics/algorithmic democracy.</li>\n\n<li>Nadia and Jasmin joined forces for DIY days in Gothenborg.</li>\n\n<li>Simone and Yolanda are deploying\u00a0Casa Buna as a waypoint to Petros's Expedition Freedom.</li>\n\n<li>Kat has organized a dinner with a bunch of social venture people for Nadia to present Edgeryders and make a case for the potential social entrepreneurs at the edge.</li>\n\n<li>Anthony, Rysiek, Kat, Felipe Gonzalez and I are discussing a Eurohackathon in collaboration with the European Parliament for the 2014 Euro elections.</li>\n\n<li>Ben, Nadia and Dougald have all been guest lecturers at the design course Ola is giving in Hyperisland Stockholm.</li>\n\n<li>The unMonastery (Ben, Gaia, Bembo, Ola, Nadia, Jay and others) has moved to the stage of prototype. I was instrumental in funding the first iteration.</li>\n\n<li>And of course, there is Mission:Baltic, in which some of us were involved with an Edgeryders hat (-ish).</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nThere are certainly others I don't see.\u00a0\n\nThis is pretty amazing. If we were an incubator, we'd have on of the best\u00a0success rates in propitiating new projects. This is an impact we can be proud of.\u00a0\n\nSo, you see. If you want some kind of systemic change, your best bet is to catalyze a lot of these meetings of minds. This will be the contribution of Edgeryders, the company. In order to make this happen, it will need to align this goal with the goal of others: and advise organizations, do research, write reports, organize events. Some direct solving might be there, but I think <em>the people</em> in Edgeryders are better at\u00a0solving problems than an Edgeryders organization.\u00a0Whatever creates learning and connecting opportunities, while\u00a0giving\u00a0changemakers opportunities to shine.

Firstly, in the context of the post-communist part of the Baltic region, we should think about the current crisis conditions in the context of our communist-era experiences and the transformation period. It might be fruitful to consider strategies for coping with everyday life under communism - people \"made do\" back then under much harsher living conditions - as templates for solutions that apply as well today, albeit in totally different social, political and economic conditions. It seems that what is now emerging as handicraft and do-it-yourself movements, the makers approach or a frugality of life sometimes associated with the hackers movement, in our region has its roots in the past. \"Do it yourself\" was gaining momentum before the crisis - in my opinion as a reaction to growing automation and standardization of life; and to a need for doing work with your own hands, in increasingly non-material jobs and lifestyles. But in the time of crisis it gains a new, practical dimension. There's a broader, theoretical backdrop to this idea, in the concept of Parallel Polis, developed in the 1970s, communist Czechoslovakia by a dissident, Vaclav Benda.\n\nBenda believed that in face of corrupt, ineffective social, economic, political or cultural institutions that cannot be overthrown, the civil society needs to build their own \"parallel institutions\". To this I would like to add one more idea, by a famous Polish dissident Jacek Kuro\u0144 - an idea formulated at the end of his life, already in the XXI century, and concerning our modern, ever more digital and technical societies. Kuro\u0144 - who for all of his life was not a thinker about technology - describes in his last book, \"A Republic for my Grandchildren\", a state of wildness that our societies have entered because of rapid technological change. Change that caused previous values and ways of doing things to deteriorate. At the same time technologies do not provide by themselves new answers, values and ways of doing - or do so much worse than culture and social norms do. Thus we face currently the challenge of forming these new norms, applicable to a society rapidly changed by digital technologies; Kuro\u0144 is fully aware, that looking back, at past solutions, is not an option.\n\nPutting these two ideas together, we can reach the conclusion that a new Parallel Polis is being constructed today, which attempts to establish collectively new values, modes of acting and being, and new social institutions. I believe that at the heart of this activity is inspiration by what can be described an \"internet culture\" - the original core values of internet's creators and institutional models developed by its pioneer users. Lawrence Lessig calls this the \"Net 95\", believing that 1995 was the peak moment at which internet architecture supported an \"extraordinary democratic moment\" and such values as freedom, equality, anonymity, open and universal access. I believe that modes of action developed for example within core internet governance (the RFC process), within the Wikipedia and other collaborative action communities (a process Yochai Benkler has described in general terms as \"commons based peer production) give us institutional templates that are now being applied also beyond online communication. At this point it is worthwhile to quote William Gibson, who observes that there is \"this perpetual toggling between nothing being new, under the sun, and everything having very recently changed\". Indeed, in these new institutions we see traces of traditional, commons-based institutions, or of ideas developed by alternative movements of the XX-th century. Nevertheless, there is a sense that they are being reworked and reapplied to digital conditions.\n\nI have been personally involved in the free culture and pro-open movements since around 2004 - mainly as initiator and public lead of Creative Commons in Poland. Currently, my interests include such areas as Open Access in science, open education or open government and open data. All over this field, I see elements of such \"new Parallel Polis\" being established. Naturally most important is not the content being produced, but methodologies for collaborative action and for sharing that are being developed, and then applied to many different ideas. I believe that we are dealing with new modes of production, consumption, distribution and sharing of content - which, interestingly, are slowly being applied to material goods as well (with such concepts as open hardware, stellar success of Arduino electronics).\n\nYet there does seem to be a blind spot within the free culture / open movements, which concerns the issue of funding work that leads to the creation of content. This can be to some degree explained by the fact that the movement is agnostic to the ways that content is funded, and focuses upon what happens to content once it exists. Secondly, free culture is heavily applied in the field of non-commercial, amateur or volunteer action. There is also an optimistic faith at work, a belief that things will solve itself and new business and funding models will develop.\n\nAfter over a decade of intensive development of open models, and at a time when a crisis is causing increasingly severe labour problems, it might be time to reconsider these assumptions - and place the issue of funding, of sustainability of new models of work much more at the heard of the open movement. It is a movement within which such issues have been addressed - but usually as side issues; and the solutions provided are partial or remain marginal, without a clear way of scaling to become much more common. One example can be that of large, collaborative free software projects - research on their participants demonstrates that even without financial profit, they gain experience, signal their skills, build contacts - all of which can translate to a later success on a job market, or as means of supporting a related \"standard\" job. But this model has not been applied successfully beyond software development. Wikipedia is a rare outlier in this case, and even in its case, due to differences between production of software and other type of content, much fewer people can make a \"job\" out of writing Wikipedia articles. This is in my opinion a key area in which insight is needed: on how scaling, sustainable job models - or if not jobs, sustainable lifestyles - can be build around open production and distribution models.\n\nSome effort has been made of course to work with funding issues. Crowdfunding has been for the last few years a hyped term, but indeed the concept seems to have large potential. At the same time, it is easy to argue that there are limits to crowdfunding, and that quite possibly it does not work in every cultural context - and might turn out to be quite an American thing. The key issue, in my opinion, is how the crowdfunding model can be shifted from funding exciting, one-time, creative enterprises to providing stable, sustainable support - for example for an individual creator or maker. The Finnish Brickstarter project starts with a similar assumption: that a platform for funding and sustaining urban projects is very different from a platform for funding computer games. Similarly, while the general insight of collaborative funding will hold true, in details a crowdfunded job would have to look very different.\n\nThe last point I want to make concerns libraries. To give some context: even after a decade, and even with the singular example of Wikipedia as a mainstream open phenomenon, a lot of the models described above remain marginal. And seem strange enough and difficult to hold a small chance of scaling to a level, where they begin to solve social problems. 3D printing is an interesting area with large opportunity for establishing new jobs and enterprises, build around an open ethos, as well as open and thus relatively cheap technology - but it won't scale quickly (and by the time it does it most probably will transfer from a \"fablab\", craftsmanship or artisanal model to a mass-produced, standardized, corporate one). It is nevertheless worthwhile to study and develop these \"internet inspired\" solutions - either as small, local solutions; or as experiments that one day might scale. But it is also worth looking already now at spaces and solutions that approach these issues at a more mundane, easy to understand and implement way. And in the Polish context, libraries are today such spaces. In theory places for sharing of knowledge, in practice they are - as research conducted in Poland by the Library Development Program shows - places where a lot of people come searching for labour advice. There is plenty of talk in Poland about establishing new social / civic / public institutions - comparable to libraries, cultural centers and even social care centers (which in Poland, under the term \"house of culture\", exist in every county) - but streamlined for dealing with social and cultural challenges of today. Trying to define a template for an institution that can be located at every county as part of a public network is a good exercise for simplifying and mainstreaming the fringe models and experiences described above. In my opinion, libraries are currently institutions most suited for conducting such an exercise. Especially if we agree that Parallel Polish does not need to be build from scratch. We know well enough from remix culture that new works are at best built by reworking existing ones.\n\nThus the field can today be described as very broad, to include not just areas of content production, but such concepts as crowdfunding or collaborative consumption.\n\n<em>This text is available under a <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/pl/\">Creative Commons Attribution license</a>.

Une extension du niveau mental va se produire par l\u2019ouverture du c\u0153ur.</em>'\n\nDieter Ernst Broers, n\u00e9 en 1951, a fait des recherches depuis sa formation scientifique dans la recherche fondamentale en bio-physique. Depuis 1981, il travaille avec des champs \u00e9lectromagn\u00e9tiques (non thermiques) de faibles intensit\u00e9s et s'int\u00e9resse \u00e0 leurs effets sur les syst\u00e8mes biologiques, ce qui a conduit \u00e0 un nouveau proc\u00e9d\u00e9 th\u00e9rapeutique.\n\nEn raison de ses d\u00e9couvertes m\u00e9dicales, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9 comme membre au sein de l'ICSC, Comit\u00e9 International pour le D\u00e9veloppement Scientifique. Depuis 1992, il participe \u00e0 la direction de l'Acad\u00e9mie Internationale de Biophysique (IAB) de l'ICSD dont le pr\u00e9sident d'honneur est Prof. M. Calvin/USA (prix Nobel) et avec Prof. J. Deisenhofer/Allemagne (prix Nobel) et Prof. A.R. Gopal-Ayengar/Inde et Pr\u00e9sident Prof. E. Gornik/Autriche (M\u00fcnchen et Innsbruck), Prof. A.M. Kuzin/Russie (membre de l'Acad\u00e9mie Russe des Sciences) et Prof. P. Slonimsky/France (membre de l'Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences).\n\nMonsieur Broers a contribu\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re essentielle au d\u00e9veloppement de l'ICSD. En raison de son incitation et de son engagement particuliers, une section de l'ICSD et une section sur les \"champs \u00e9lectromagn\u00e9tiques en biom\u00e9decine\" ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9es \u00e0 l'IAB de Berlin, et des contacts politiques ont \u00e9t\u00e9 initi\u00e9s au niveau de minist\u00e8res. Monsieur Broers participe activement \u00e0 un projet de recherche sur les effets m\u00e9dicaux de rayonnements ionisants et non ionisants.\n\nLa th\u00e9orie de Dieter Broers, non seulement explique pourquoi et comment plusieurs individus - des gens ordinaires - entrent actuellement dans un \u00e9tat physique de conscience, mais il y a lieu d'esp\u00e9rer qu'une proportion consid\u00e9rable de la population mondiale effectue dans un avenir rapproch\u00e9 un bon prodigieux d'\u00e9veil. (<a href=\"http://2012.eklablog.net/06-dieter-broers-bio-physicien-une-vie-pour-la-science-a28136018\">R\u00e9f</a>)\n\nAppliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 un contexte de gouvernement ouvert, je consid\u00e8re que cette th\u00e9orie est tr\u00e8s s\u00e9duisante, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que nous nous battons avec la r\u00e9elle probl\u00e9matique de verrouillage des dirigeants politiques, qui constitue un frein majeur au d\u00e9veloppement du gouvernement ouvert \u00e0 travers le monde. Avec la th\u00e9orie de Broers, il y aurait lieu d'esp\u00e9rer qu'un grand nombre d'humains basculent soudainement, en raison d'un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne naturel (\u00e9lectromagn\u00e9tique solaire), dans un \u00e9tat de conscience plus \u00e9lev\u00e9. Il est probable qu'il y aurait, parmi ce nombre de gens plus \u00e9veill\u00e9s, des dirigeants et des gestionnaires gouvernementaux.\n\nIl est impossible de forcer une personne \u00e0 changer contre son gr\u00e9. Faire reconna\u00eetre \u00e0 un dirigeant qu'il devrait penser autrement, on peut difficilement imaginer que des citoyens arrivent \u00e0 faire ceci, qu'ils arrivent \u00e0 transformer spontan\u00e9ment des centaines de milliers de dirigeants.\n\nMais s'il survenait un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne naturel, en 2012, et pas dans 20 ans, s'il arrivait quelque chose d'important dans les mois qui viennent, qui ait pour effet physique de transmuter les consciences, \u00e0 la fois celles des citoyens et des dirigeants, ce serait, avons-le... assez extraordinaire!\n\nSi je n'avais pas moi-m\u00eame fait l'exp\u00e9rience du Kundalini, c'est-\u00e0-dire de l'\u00e9veil de la conscience par une transformation physique, qui se traduit par l'augmentation de la fr\u00e9quence vibratoire du corps, j'aurais pu \u00eatre tent\u00e9e de consid\u00e9rer la th\u00e9orie Broers avec quelque h\u00e9sitation. Je me dis que si c'est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 moi \u2015je n'ai rien d'un surhomme voyez-vous \u2015, du moins, c'est que j'ai cru jusqu'\u00e0 maintenant... (!), alors cela peut certainement se produire chez tant d'autres.\n\nJe vous invite \u00e0 lire cette interview de Dieter Broers, cela vaut la peine de prendre 15 minutes pour lire tr\u00e8s attentivement l'article. <a href=\"http://portail2012.wordpress.com/2011/05/27/2012-il-va-y-avoir-un-saut-de-conscience-quasiment-de-letat-dhomme-a-celui-de-surhomme/\">http://portail2012.wordpress.com/2011/05/27/2012-il-va-y-avoir-un-saut-de-conscience-quasiment-de-letat-dhomme-a-celui-de-surhomme/</a>\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-20 21:23:08", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:59.713471", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1021, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 20.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 4, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25810, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1454, "post_number": 28, "raw": "<b>That's a story I definitely want to hear</b>\n\n...or better still, I want to <em>read it</em>.

It's all up and running, just looking a bit rough (beta phase still) \u2013 next thing is, I have to rework and extend the service catalogue.)\n\n<em>\"While with using some more multidimentional accounting, and having clarity what we really need in terms of real world assets. I also don't see spreadsheets integrating with interfaces where people can offer help with securing those assets.\"</em>\n\nEven while using cash money, the step of acquiring assets for the value symbolized by money is not captured by the spreadsheets. But rather by project and task management, and it is a complex task by itself \u2013 think of stuff like some rare spare parts that are hard to find at all. Looking at it the other way, abstraction by using the concept of \"value\" allows to solve one part of the problem without having to care for other parts. It also allows more flexible contributions (say, a donation of 5.50 EUR contributing to a purchase of a laptop). Both is true for moneyless economy as well \u2013 which is why we retained the concept of \"value\" with a numeraire in Makerfox / Economy App. There's a new feature in the pipeline (not visible publicly so far) that allows \"wiring\" such value to other members as a payment, just that the payment will both be sent and received in products and services that add up to the specified value, not by handing over money symbols (cash money). This would allow people to support unMonastery by donating such value (say, 25 EUR a month) by doing completely unrelated work (say, in one month one hour of language course teaching and the equivalent of 0.7 hand-woven socks). Network bartering converts it to something that unMonastery ordered (say, again some video subtitling, resp. a part of that job).\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-13 10:19:01", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:04.486346", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 353, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [21350], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4140, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4107, "post_number": 1, "raw": "As we discussed in the call of 16th February, we need fast onboarding of KITE as the lead partner.

It was advertised as welcoming a very diverse crowd: programmers, but also activists, journalists and interested citizens. So I went, opting to choose a project to work on onsite rather than put forward an idea. Around 45 people and 12 projects were submitted, from mapping usable local bicycle routes (Cluj has <a href=\"http://helpfulsheep.com/biciclete/#slide9\">only 10km</a> of highly disconnected bike trails!), to scraping datasets from the Romanian open government <a href=\"http://data.gov.ro/\">portal</a>, to visualizations of local pharmacies to figure out which one is the closest to you and open at any time.\n\nMost people who showed up were very young passionate programmers, fond of building apps in general, and (understandably) a minority of which were familiar with open data per se. I can't imagine a better pretext for learning about open source and licensing than building an event in a format that is as trendy as the hackathon format.\n\nMy non-tech skills didn't seem to be of particular use to any team, even after specifically offering my help, so in a tiny sub-team I took on the more general task of documentation and research: tracking down former local, general purpose hackathons (all tech based) to dig deeper and see which of the projects and apps took off in the follow up. Not much surprise here, it turns out almost none that we could get hold of made it so far.. Personal hypotheses for that and in case we needed them, more arguments for Edgeryders moving on with our own version of <a href=\"/t/harmonious-hackathon/587\">hackathons as being harmonious:</a>\n\n1. Hackathons are creating a lot of momentum and buzz, pulling lots of private resources yet incentivizing <strong>little follow up.</strong>\u00a0\n\n2. They are framed mostly as<strong> </strong>competitive, prize winning events and <strong>less as collaborative events</strong> fostering solid team building.\n\n3. \u00a0Programmers are the core target and so <strong>accommodating other skills becomes difficult,</strong> no pun intended. Their lack of means projects will fail to build strong communication, marketing and community around them.\u00a0\n\nMaybe I'm wrong, but does someone else have positive project examples from the hackathons you've been attending?\n\nThere is much to learn regarding inclusiveness and real diversity when building \"open\" hackathons, but there is something humbling in watching coders taking on the hardest tasks and literally burying themselves in data for 48hrs. They are heroes and make one fall in love with technology. Even from afar.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/bba2ec5c12243ef5a80d76de2ed44bd1bcf6a8b9.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"334\"><br>\n\n", "created_at": "2015-02-23 12:52:24", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:23.389510", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 474, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20295, "user_id": 943, "topic_id": 1648, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Favourite part:</b>\n\n<em><strong>\"As you said knowledge are more and more accessible.

The resulting collective intelligence will lead to better informed decision-making processes and empower citizens, through participation and interaction, to adopt more sustainable individual and collective behaviours and lifestyles.</em>\n\n<em>The challenge includes the deployment at larger scales of digital social platforms for multi-disciplinary groups developing innovative solutions to societal challenges.</em>\n\nI think this call might be relevant to Edgeryders. Though it is probably unwieldy, as European funding in general, it could also be a better fit to Edgeryders than other calls.\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">Why it is relevant</h2>\n\nI can see at least two strands of Edgeryders activity fitting well here.\n\n<strong>One: <a href=\"/t/notes-from-the-lote4-session-on-the-future-of-care-in-the-hands-of-hackers/3920\">the future of care in the hands of hackers</a>/ HackCare Manifesto</strong>. Many of us worry about the drift emerging from the clash between Europe's cash-strapped health and social care system and the Internet of Things. Since the IoT is profit-driven and large corporates-dominated, we run a very serious risk of ending up in a system of \"care by artifacts\". Worse, these artifacts would be proprietary, untransparent, impossible to open and hack; and suppliers of these artifacts have a strong business incentive to sell <em>not the product, but the servic</em>e \u2013 it stabilizes the revenue. This, in turn, makes them more money if we never really heal, and stay dependent on paying the subscription fee to be well. I am not even looking at privacy issues, insurance companies getting involved, big data crunching resulting in people getting excluded from the system etc. This scenario is downright dystopian \u2013 we could call it \"running Windows in your body\".\n\nAt the Future of care session at LOTE4, we all agreed we can do better than that. We envisioned a system of \"care by a community of hackers, armed with cheap, open source tools\". This scenario is not a return to the country doctor: you still get to enlist sensors and algorithms to alert you if an anomaly comes up. But you do not delude yourself: benefits do not come from the artifacts, but from the community that builds, programs and deploys them, <em>and that you can be a part of</em>. Imagine a hackerspace for medicine, where doctors, technologists, and patients come together to design and deploy the system that best serves their local community; it would be resilient, and it would be trustable, because (a) it would be open source and (b) everyone is a patient sooner or later, so the doctors and the technologists <em>themselves</em> use what they build. We are seeing moves in this direction: there are already small companies that build medical sensors for Arduino, and Arduino has decided to <em>fight</em> the Internet of Things, trying to build an open source version of it.\n\n<strong>Two: OpenEthnographer</strong>. The discussion at LOTE4 shows how richly textured the problem is, and how important it is that all voices are heard. This looks like a job for OpenEthnographer: an open massive online ethnography on health/social care in the age of the Internet of Things is likely to lead to important insights; and, crucially, to people with skills and drive discovering each other <em>and just going for it,</em> deploying prototypes. I think this stuff is prototypable: there is no need to go out and build an entire health care system. For example, <a href=\"/u/lucasg\">@LucasG</a> could partner up with some biohacker and the local community of 7,000 insuline-dependent patients in the Canary Islands to figure out if they can make insuline locally, instead of importing it\u00a0 from Germany. It is one problem, well defined, with a clear local dimension, and the local community stands a chance to solve it.\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">Why it is a good fit</h2>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Edgeryders has some track record in the collective intelligence space. We are marginally involved in the first CAPS (there was a pre-Horizon 2020 Collective Awareness Platforms program) call, as an external partner to the <a href=\"http://catalyst-fp7.eu/\">CATALYST</a> consortium (to be announced); we have the OpenEthnographer project going; and everything we did from the Council of Europe days on has always been about nurturing and deploying collective intelligence.</li>\n\n<li>CAPS2 is going to depart from CAPS1 in that it is going to insist on funding projects that are (1) not too technology-driven; (2) are proposed by consortia that have at least two non-technology partners; (3) are proposed by \"real communities with real people\". I know this because the CAPS2 programme manager, Fabrizio Sestini, announced it in his speech at the launch of the call.</li>\n\n<li>Fabrizio himself is good people, and I believe he is running this thing with high integrity. Some edgeryders will remember him at LOTE2, helping us to figure out why is it so difficult for public sector organizations to work with informal networks like Edgeryders. That memorable conversation was one of the things that led to establishing <a href=\"/company/home\">a corporate vehicle</a> for the Edgeryders community.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">What we could do and what we need to do it</h2>\n\nWe could mount a project of type A (Collective awareness pilots for bottom-up participatory innovation paradigms) with two dimensions.\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Technological dimension: annotation of content on the web as conducive to collective intelligence. Part of this is our vision of Massive Open Online Ethnography, and this is what Edgeryders would do in the consortium. But other people care about other things, from OKFN with hypothes.is to argument mapping etcetera. \"Web annotation\" might be the unifying theme.</li>\n\n<li>Social sustainability dimension: we focus on a problem, like health and social care, that we think collective intelligence might address through the tools provided.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nIn this way, we could fund both the further development of OpenEthnographer and a large scale ethnography of the health care vs. the Internet of Things problem space. We could even prototype solutions, and do ethnography on those too!\n\nType A projects are large: typically 0.5 to 2 million EUR. To realize this vision, we need to be a in a consortium with a couple of important universities, one of which should be the lead partner. One of them could be a computer science department (for the tech stuff); the other one an anthropology or social sciences department (for the ethno stuff).\n\nAlternatively (or additionally?), we could build projects of type B (Multidisciplinary research on collective awareness platforms \u2013 Internet Science) or C (Digital Social Platforms). B is interesting to us because it investigates things like <em>\"motivations and incentives for online collaboration, the impact of extended awareness and peer pressure in driving more sustainable behaviours, defining online reputation mechanisms, and facilitating policy and technological developments addressing identity, anonymity, ethics, (user-centric) privacy preservation, monitoring of network neutrality, non-discriminatory access, collective governance (including Internet governance), new economic and value creation models beyond GDP, quality requirements for user-generated knowledge, visualisation of social interactions and trends\"</em>.\n\nC is interesting because of the focus on the international dimension. Both B and C projects are expected to request \"small contributions\", that in this context means 2-4 million EUR (!) \u2013 <a href=\"http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/ict/photonics/docs/photonics-inh2020-wp2014-15-v18nov_en.pdf\">source</a>, p. 23. Projects of type A and B (but not C) have the requirement of having two non-ICT partners in the consortia. I don't know much of these types of projects, but presumably we would need to be a part of a consortium with two or three very solid universities in the lead.\n\nIf you have any opinion or useful advice, let <a href=\"/u/noemi\">@Noemi</a> know \u2013 she will attend the CAPS2 networking event in Brusselson December 16th.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-12-06 14:34:10", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:22.484211", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1448, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 40.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22010, "user_id": 2334, "topic_id": 4519, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Thanks @trythis</b>\n\nSome nice links.\n\nFor producing your own media, have a look at the templates created by <a href=\"http://streetreporter.org/tools\">StreetReporter</a>.\n\nSimple and effective templates which with a little practise, allows the creation of broadcast quality material.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-12 12:45:16", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:02.651477", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 50, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 6.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [20442], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21334, "user_id": 493, "topic_id": 1303, "post_number": 14, "raw": "<b>Bonjour,\n\nEst-ce que vous avez</b>\n\nBonjour,\n\nEst-ce que vous avez trouv\u00e9 le soutien en r\u00e9alisent votre projet social , je parle ici du pouvoir public et de l'administration de l'universit\u00e9 ?\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-02-14 12:38:23", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:58.637954", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 42, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20630, "user_id": 1935, "topic_id": 2650, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>about the urban communities convergence in berlin ?</b>\n\n<span>hello [Vahagn] can u give me more info about that urban communities convergence in Berlin.

Propose to such institutions an experimental project involving 3-4 countries from the developing world, with a financial support of about twenty organizations and several States. Present the results of the experimental project to an umbrella organisation, in this case, the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, in the hope that it serves as a catalyst, it snaps into place an international partnership that leads to the implementation of a five-year open government implementation plan, and ultimately leads to the creation of a new vector, an international association of open government states.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f5/Open_Goverment_Partnership.JPG/220px-Open_Goverment_Partnership.JPG\" style=\"width: 220px; height: 189px;\">\n\nThe only existing global 'system' in place is a multilateral partnership, the <a href=\"http://www.opengovpartnership.org\">Open Governmnet Partnership</a>.

Talking \u201cme\u201d as part of \u201cprecariuous: indeed, PhD student who finished compeltely inpractical studies \u2013 Political Science with Journalism, who tried her best to get as much experience as possible, and who is now failing with finding a job that would be suitable to my needs, competences and schedule. Due to corporational and traditional thinking of working employers, who believe the only motivation for people to work and fulfill their routine, dull work, is to force them to the 8-hours schedule, which might turn out to be a complete fail soon enough. With amazing access to new technologies, IT equippment, preparation we are usually encouraged to give up any creative environment, we\u2019re cut off from ideas of being mobile and somehow free to organise yourselves: in reward we are given this amazing chance of being part of OK paid system, in where many things are at least quite certain. As educational path does not equipp us with courage and ability to break-out from the pattern, this is the common expectation of young people finishing studies: fitting in the system is a great idea.\n\nBut those who were courageous enough, have a great chance of doing something amazing with their lives, provided they are ready to live in uncertain circumstances, afford risk, prepare themselves for financial disciplne, etc. They will not end up in front of a desk in the office \u2013 maybe sometimes, when it\u2019s a small office they started, or their private desk is the same one. They will struggle with success to detach themselves from the obligation to go to work every morning \u2013 they want to live in different places and do some things, that so often do not require being at the spot anyway. And they will have incentive to constantly develop and adapt. I think fact that so many of us is being left outside from the jobs \u2013 due to many reasons, from devaluation of educational degrees from lack of competences and different market needs than offers \u2013 will chose this way and start enjoying the effects of the crisis. At the end of the day market will be able to accept the facts it overlooked so far, keeping us busy and obedient.\n\nInnovation has been an interesting response to the problems. All these actions that were mentioned in this post remind me of one amazing initative of US people who decided to support disadvantaged communities by helping them developing their own bike workshops: the idea is simple, people from places in Africa for instance (but this idea is a solution for so many places around us) are given a job, are taught skills, have a chance to overcome the exclusion from means of transportation, which is a great step towards breaking the visious circle of social injustice and exlusion. One Street, which is the name of the initative, bring a vital response to the question on social potential: civil society is able to use its resources in such situation, give an appropirate answer to the questions what should be done, help the state, which fails unfortunatelly quite often, to fulfill the needs of the society, look after the needs. We live in an abstract world that tells people around how equal it all is \u2013 while not being able to even differences and problems. it is not that I have definite answer. But I believe in grassroot action and small scale activities, mentoring, ideas exchange \u2013 they will help us improve at first.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-02-09 18:33:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:52.226731", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 705, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 1.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27519, "user_id": 2330, "topic_id": 5154, "post_number": 13, "raw": "<b>Rescheduling Marek Hudon session at 2pm</b>\n\nCause from 3pm we need the room for a SenseFiction animated by C\u00e9line Bouton from MakeSense.

Produce a realistic scenario of policy for community-driven provision of care services at scale</strong>\n\n2.1. Consider the implications of applying community-driven design and delivery of care services to the context of European welfare states. Give special attention to the issue of fairness and ownership of the input contributed to open processes.\n\n2.2. Identify best practice in community welfare, and in general care services designed and/or delivered through collectively intelligent processes, and learn from them.\u00a0\n\n<strong>Objective 3. Assemble a software stack to monitor and assist collective intelligence social dynamics in online communities\u00a0</strong>\n\n3.1 Further test, validate and if necessary extend OpenEthnographer in the context of the conversation on care (see section 1.3.5)\n\n3.1 Further test, validate and if necessary extend Edgesense in the context of the conversation on care (see section 1.3.5)\n\n3.3 Build and test a prototype of a tool for \u00a0semantic network analysis (see 1.4.2)\n\n<hr width=\"75%\">\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">ethics, data management plan and budget</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>If relevant, address how your work involves the ethics work package and/or the data management plan, what has been or still needs to be done.</li>\n\n<li>You should also say a word about budget consumption -- everything going as planned, some actions started later than planned and budget not all consummed, etc.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<hr width=\"75%\">\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">presentations</h3>\n\nWP1 (SCIMPULSE) -\u00a0Learn, engage and disseminate\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Lorep Ipsum</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nWP2 (ER) -\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>@Noemi \u2013 Engaging, onboarding and managing the opencare online community.

When Winston Churchill uttered any words on this in 1943, it wasn't the very first words in a conversation, but a powerful contribution to a conversation that had been going on for a while.\n\nI saw this quite powerfully a few nights go when I came across this passage from HG Wells from his book \"In the Fourth Year\" (free, online and easy to find):\n\n\"It is a dangerous thing to recommend specific books out of so large and various a literature as the \u201cLeague of Nations\u201d idea has already produced, but the reader who wishes to reach beyond the range of this book, or who does not like its tone and method, will probably find something to meet his needs and tastes better in Marburg\u2019s \u201cLeague of Nations,\u201d a straight- forward account of the American side of the movement by the former United States Minister in Belgium, on the one hand, or in the concluding parts of Mr. Fayle\u2019s \u201cGreat Settle- ment\u201d (1915), a frankly sceptical treatment from the British Imperialist point of view, on the other. An illuminating dis- cussion, advocating peace treaties rather than a league, is Sir Walter Phillimore\u2019s \u201cThree Centuries of Treaties.\u201d Two ex- cellent books from America, that chance to be on my table, are Mr. Goldsmith\u2019s \u201cLeague to Enforce Peace\u201d and \u201cA World in Ferment\u201d by President Nicholas Murray Butler. Mater\u2019s \u201cSocie\u0301te\u0301 des Nations\u201d (Didier) is an able presentation of a French point of view. Brailsford\u2019s \u201cA League of Nations\u201d is already a classic of the movement in England, and a very full and thorough book; and Hobson\u2019s \u201cTowards International Government\u201d is a very sympathetic contribution from the\n\nEnglish liberal left; but the reader must understand that these two writers seem disposed to welcome a peace with an unrevolutionized Germany, an idea to which, in common with most British people, I am bitterly opposed. Walsh\u2019s \u201cWorld Rebuilt\u201d is a good exhortation, and Mugge\u2019s \u201cParlia- ment of Man\u201d is fresh and sane and able. The omnivorous reader will find good sense and quaint English in Judge Mejdell\u2019s \u201cJus Gentium,\u201d published in English by Olsen\u2019s of Christiania. There is an active League of Nations Society in Dublin, as well as the London and Washington ones, pub- lishing pamphlets and conducting propaganda. All these books and pamphlets I have named happen to lie upon my study table as I write, but I have made no systematic effort to get together literature upon the subject, and probably there are just as many books as good of which I have never even heard.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-02-17 11:15:48", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:40.971639", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 550, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [10303], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27436, "user_id": 1457, "topic_id": 1861, "post_number": 13, "raw": "<b>Thanks ! :- )</b>\n\nYes.\u00a0<span>Well, Ok, Bus it is!</span>\n\n<span>Thanks ! :- )</span>\n\n", "created_at": "2013-10-09 13:58:03", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:31.538616", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 39, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [27278], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5168, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 5135, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9308632ed1a52d4ec7b2706f5d436a52ad7ad9c2.jpg\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\n<span>Hello everyone,</span>\n\n<span>If the Fail/unFail edition is your first time participating in LOTE then you are probably finding it chaotic and a bit confusing. Don't worry, you are not alone. For months there is wild creative chaos, and then somehow things fall into place just as we are opening the doors to the event venue :)</span>\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\"><span>So what's this all about?</span></h2>\n\n<a href=\"/u/kiravde\" style=\"font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.7;\">@KiraVde</a><span>\u00a0</span><a href=\"/u/ireinga\" style=\"font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.7;\">@ireinga</a><span>\u00a0and\u00a0myself\u00a0have been discussing how we could go about building meaningful, generative partnerships around the event. And we have produced a first draft as a starting point for conversations with different organisations. I realised that opening this process could be helpful for newbies who want to get a quick overview of how the different pieces fit together, and where we are going with all this. Here's the draft in progress:\u00a0</span><a href=\"http://bit.ly/1SMOaVP\" style=\"font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 23.0400009155273px; line-height: 43.5200004577637px;\">http://bit.ly/1SMOaVP</a><span>.</span>\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\"><span>The Background</span></h2>\n\n<span>We believe it makes sense to put some effort into building meaningful and generative partnerships with a number of organisations around the Fail|unFail concept. Because the more people we speak to, the more we see there is a real need for looking into this. LOTE5 could help spark much needed conversations about how we deal with failure effectively, but this requires us to pay attention to what happens after the event, as well as making an amazing four days together</span><span>:</span>\n\n<span>a) <strong>Generate </strong><strong>high quality</strong><strong>\u00a0documentation and material that allows us to \"take the learning home\"</strong> and share it with others. Videos, blogs summarising main points from different sessions. Maybe even a short visual report like the one we produced for LOTE4: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1QP8vsQ\">http://bit.ly/1QP8vsQ\u00a0</a>.</span>\n\n<span>b) <strong>Encourage continued learning, building on relationships and developing new projects</strong>\u00a0also once the physical event is finished. Both <a href=\"http://opencare.cc\">OpenCare</a> and <a href=\"http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/22717/1/the-unmonastery-a-commune-for-the-internet-age\">unMonastery</a> were born out of conversations at LOTE events, but they would not have happened without a lot of follow-up work to develop ideas, write proposals, do outreach, get official commitment and resources, barnraise etc.</span>\n\n<span>c) <strong>Cover <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xs1Wx6kIGJUVnsm_8GPVWr_v9gTEysO9z9uNTYT7m_4/edit?usp=sharing\">costs</a>\u00a0of building LOTE event</strong>\u00a0so that we are sufficiently compensating people who put in a lot of hard work for their time, and are able to invest in making them better and better every year.

All they care about is if and how what we are offering can solve a pressing problem for them.</span></span>\n\n<span><span>In building any new initiative, we need to ensure it creates enough outputs that compensate people for the required inputs, socially and economically. If that is not there, whatever you are trying to do will fail to draw enough engagement, investment and support to succeed. Convincing people to get involved boils down to having credible answers to two questions:</span></span>\n\n<span><span>A. </span><span>What is it prospective participants and strategic partners really want to achieve and how can the initiative help them do so</span><span>?</span></span>\n\n<span><span>B. </span><span>What are quick, easy deliverables that will produce what feel like tangible results for the participants and partners respectively, and that we can give them very early on in the initiative</span><span>?</span></span>\n\n<span><span>This is where we need to start in the relationship development process if we are to engage people who are stretched thin for time (and money) in working with us on </span><span>any</span><span> initiative. So how do we answer these questions? We propose the following process:</span></span>\n\n<span><span>1. </span><span>Pick an issue and form a team of individuals who want to build opportunities to work on it together.</span><span> </span><span>People want to know who they are dealing with and what makes them credible...as well as what issues/ topics are in focus. In the context of</span><a href=\"/t/welcome-to-lote5/4849\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span> </span><span>#LOTE5</span></a><span> this would mean we ought to have a short description of the topic/issue + short bios for the people driving it up on the minisite already. Same goes for</span><a href=\"http://opencare.cc/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span> </span><span>OpenCare</span></a><span>, we need a number of options for how people can contribute to the project ranging from sharing important questions they want answered about care...to developing new OpenCare products and services. </span></span>\n\n<span><span>2. </span><span>Offer up a point of view about the issues and options that galvanizes reactions.</span><span> </span><span>We surface participants and partners by publishing high quality, engaging posts on a regular basis and making sure they reach far and wide (goal: 10k readers/post). We need to come away having learned something new about the issue we care about. Check out this</span><a href=\"/en/opencare/care-by-communities-greeces-shadow-zero-cash-health-care\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span> </span><span>post on Greece's zero-cash shadow healthcare system</span></a><span> as an example.</span></span>\n\n<span><span>3. </span><span>Follow up by contacting people who show interest in posts/presentations and invite them to a call/coffee</span><span>.</span><span> What did they think about your presentation or post? What is a problem statement that is relevant to them/their work? \u00a0What potential endstate benefits do they see for themselves/own organisations and what are they losing by not exploring this? If they are interested and it feels like they have something to contribute follow up by inviting them to relevant events and asking them to pick a role (host, speak, reach out and invite others). Want to set one up but unsure how? let's talk- it's a lot easier than you think, and A LOT of fun :)</span></span>\n\n<span><span>4. </span><span>Offer intimate spaces for networking and personalised channels for sense-making.</span><span> </span><span>Give the prospective participants and partners a sense of what it\u2019s like to work together, inviting them to Informal events like</span><a href=\"/en/agora/design-when-everybody-designs-an-evening-talk-and-dinner-on?lang=hy\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span> </span><span>this one</span></a><span>.

I think it's a great idea - maybe we could see if we could host it at <a href=\"http://casajasmina.arduino.cc/\">Casa Jasmina</a>? I recently also came accross the <a href=\"http://hi-project.org/\">hi:project</a>, who seem to dance to the same vibe. It'd be great to hear thoughts/expressions of interest. Also, I'm taking Open Droplet to Hack the Earth at Calafou where I'm hoping I might find some more non-evil IoT enthusiasts :)\n\nHere's the post:\n\nLast week we had the opportunity to take Open Droplet to LOTE4: The Stewardship. Open Droplet was one of the five projects looking at physical assets, and the only one that involved Internet of Things. IoT got a pretty bad vibe going from the get-go because of the associated scary privacy and control problems. (Alberto gave me a steer to <a href=\"http://kryakk-catalogue.prokhorovfund.ru/the-epic-struggle-for-the-internet-of-things/\">Bruce Sterling's \"The Epic Struggle for the Internet of Things\"</a> , which goes a good way to explaining the issues).\n\nFor session notes, see the Open Droplet session here: <a href=\"https://lote4.hackpad.com/Stewarding-Physical-Assets-EVxm8c6PyiU\">https://lote4.hackpad.com/Stewarding-Physical-Assets-EVxm8c6PyiU</a>\n\nThe session was interesting. We had an involved discussion about other aspects of the project, from the sensor design and usability, to how best to convey information to the user.\n\nSome useful new suggestions:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>partner with hotels to raise awareness of this approach</li>\n\n<li>consider representing the total household use</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThere was reiteration of the importance of these considerations:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>open data and privacy</li>\n\n<li>comparison as a motivator</li>\n\n<li>proper use by understanding the water infrastructure</li>\n\n<li>facilitating conversation around community stewardship of water, including water harvesting</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nHowever, we didn't have that much time to discuss the IoT issues, which would have been great to explore with the EdgeRyders community. Internet of Things is happening, and could be very useful in terms of facilitating stewardship of physical assets. What we're aiming for with Open Droplet is to create a device and system that helps connect people with water, an increasingly stressed resource, so that we can take better care of it as individuals and communities - and find new ways to do so. Part of how we want to do that is by following the principles of an <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yZAsNaesDocqqtkFgucbFS_zE4tDP1Jsfszsvls7Yuc/edit\">Open Internet of Things</a>.\n\nI would love to extend the dialogue around these issues, and to have explored more the role of Internet of Things in creating social change, and looking at how sensing technologies can be tools to generate social and paradigmatic change. Due to timing issues the unconference session \"<a href=\"https://lote4.hackpad.com/How-do-we-create-a-non-evil-IoT-X5pTvtOF8ma\">How to make a non-evil IoT</a> \" didn't happen. We were going to look at building on work to make Open Hardware solutions that explicitly avoid making Big Data for the sake of it. How do you quantify without compromising people? I'd like to continue that discussion here and on the EdgeRyders platform, looking at these and other questions:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Expanding IoT - What data do we need to have from city and infrastructure providers to give useful context to individual water use?</li>\n\n<li>How do we responsibly approach the individual's rights to their data</li>\n\n<li>How do requirements for water stewardship vary around the globe? How do we accommodate these differences?</li>\n\n<li>How do we facilitate community water stewardship through interface and sensor design?</li>\n\n</ul>", "created_at": "2015-03-13 12:38:02", "updated_at": "2020-12-10 15:13:34.801620", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 668, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 15.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2334, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 396, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 363, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2014-02-23 05:29:06", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:00.472197", "deleted_at": "2017-08-07 12:18:07.159954", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1782, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23775, "user_id": 1820, "topic_id": 3123, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Just to chime in</b>\n\nTon is correct, and Elf - I've got you shortlisted (I'm heavily involved with the volunteers and think we're going to send out an announce this week - if not: bug me again).\n\nSee you at OKFestival!\n\n", "created_at": "2014-06-11 09:05:57", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:11.944014", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 48, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [105], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8402, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 5047, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>The site is going to be changed anyway</b>\n\nHi Zoe,\n\nYes there will be requirements to include the logo on all project related communications.

Microbiome will be discussed as a case for relevance of systemic approach towards collecting and analysing environment around humans, especially agriculture, and translating findings to a healthcare and environmental policy.</span>\n\nPurpose of the meeting:\n\nIn relation to the Global Agreement to be adopted by the COP21 conference, the planned meeting will focus on areas of health data allowing bio-monitoring of climate related diseases, as well as the wide theme of microbiome and influence of ecosystem on human health. The main objective of the seminar is to outline possible project ideas in above mentioned areas, which would build the case for sustained action by estimation and compilation of the burden of climate changes and the main risk factors, the cost and cost-effectiveness of interventions, the unmet need for prevention and treatment services, and the need for interventions outside the health sector.\n\n<u>Date: 4 December 2015,</u>\n\n<u>Time: 10.00 \u2013 16.00</u>\n\n<u>Venue: INSERM, 101, rue de Tolbiac, 75013, Paris; 10th floor, room 132</u>\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor further information, registration and draft agenda go to:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.iscintelligence.com/event.php?id=294\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.iscintelligence.<wbr></wbr>com/event.php?id=294</a>\n\n<strong>Please, register ASAP due to limited space.</strong>\n\n<strong>Deadline for registration: 2 December 2015.</strong>\n\nMagdalena Pacholska\n\nKey Relationships\n\n<strong>ISC Intelligence in Science</strong>\u00a0\n\nRue du Trone 4\u00a0\n\nB-1000 Brussels\u00a0\n\nTel:\u00a0<a href=\"tel:%2B32%202%208888111\" target=\"_blank\" value=\"+3228888111\">+32 2 8888111</a>\n\nMob: +32 470 208 295\n\n<a href=\"http://www.iscintelligence.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>www.iscintelligence.com</strong></a>\n\n", "created_at": "2015-11-20 10:31:57", "updated_at": "2018-05-26 11:26:29.928892", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 484, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19175, "user_id": 11, "topic_id": 1118, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>This is the kind of \"distributed\" events...</b>\n\n...I was referring to.

I am from Modena, Emilia Romagna, Italy, that just today has been hit by a 5.8 magnitude earthquake. I live in France, but my whole family and lots of friends are in hard-hit areas.\n\nAs I keep an eye on Twitter for news and updates, I realized that people are spontaneously mobilizing to create - apparently out of thin air - common resources that make a difference to the local people trying to cope with the earthquake's aftermath. Let's see:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>first of all, there is Twitter itself. By now westerners have become accostumed to the uncanny speed with which online social networks, Twitter in particular, get on top of information and spread it as it happens. I know the math behind it (Twitter is a scale-free. multihub structure, extremely good for spreading information), but watching it happen is quite fascinating. In Modena today the cellular phone network went down: I learnt my own family was safe through a tweet by my sister. The hashtag \\#terremoto has been used to pass news around and coordinate: bring water to village X,\u00a0 parents of children taking part in sport event Y know that they are all safe, etc. It has even be kept free of non.operational stuff, like the emergency lane of a road closed to all traffic saved ambulances and fire trucks.\u00a0As often before in comparable situations, professional journalists are reduced to updating their websites based on... Twitter.</li>\n\n<li>second, as the phone network failed and the need for communication was very urgent, people quickly figured out they could create a rough-and-ready data communication network simply removing the passwords that prevent unauthorized users to connect to the wi-fi hotspots in their homes, shops and offices. Citizens, businesses, local authorities and at least two telecommunication company with a commercial wi-fi offer (TIM and Vodafone - <a href=\"http://lab.vodafone.it/news/2012/05/29/terremoto-nord-italia-come-rendere-accessibile-wifi-di-vodafone-station-e-vodafone-station-2/\">here </a>is the latter's instructions) all did this. The suggestion and the instructions to reconfigure hotspots is being spread through Twitter and Facebook as I am writing this. In densely populated cities like Modena, this means a more or less complete coverage. For free, and in minutes.</li>\n\n<li>third, thousands of people were made temporarily (and in some cases, unfortunately, more than that) homeless, as their homes need to be checked for damages by technicians. The Couchsurfing network sprung into action, asking its members to post onto a specific web page whether they were willing to take on evacuees, and for how long. Immediately <a href=\"http://www.couchsurfing.org/group.html?gid=52939\">several pages of offers</a> shot up. Many list a duration of \"as long as they need to\". For those who don't know it, Couchsurfing is a network of predominantly young adults who share their couches or guest rooms: it is a way to travel to a distant city\u00a0 and not only save the money of a hotel room, but also have a local that they know.</li>\n\n</ul>So, these are three common resources that did not exist yesterday, and that today are helping to cope. There's probably others I am not aware of. It is too soon to draw any final conclusions, but at least tentatively I would like to attempt two:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>commons are in the eye of the beholder</strong>. All of those wi-fi routers were there before. It's just by looking at them in a new way and thinking \"Hey, if I open\u00a0 up my wi-fi my neighbor will be able to inform her family in a distant city that she's all right; plus, if we all do it, we will be able to compensate for the telephone network's failure.\" instead of\u00a0 \"I need to keep my wi-fi protected from free riders or, worse, pirates\" that the common good is created.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Internet culture is conducive to creating and maintaining commons</strong>. There is no going around it: all three phenomena (and many others) are intimately related to the Internet: enabled by its existence and consistent with hacker \"do it yourself\" ethics.</li>\n\n</ol>There may be a third one, but it is not very scientific: the seeming ease with which my countrymen and -women adopted such sharing behavior is a harbinger of hope. Looking forward to what comes next.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-29 16:00:05", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:05.250302", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 819, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 15.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7206, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3808, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>For me it's a go</b>\n\nPing <a href=\"/u/noemi\">@Noemi</a>, <a href=\"/u/matthias\">@Matthias</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"/u/arthurd\">@ArthurD</a>. <a href=\"/u/nadia\">@Nadia</a>\u00a0and I are aware and approve.\u00a0\n\nMaria, give it a few days and then consider it approved by default.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-10-31 19:41:01", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:42.438955", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 61, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32527, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 3779, "post_number": 18, "raw": "@Alberto I have seen you moved the speakers from sunday to public facing event.

The article itself I think is less interesting than\u00a0 the discussions in the comments from both recruiters, hiring managers and people who are or have been looking for employment.\u00a0 I wonder if there are any points in there that you think are worth highlighting or exploring further ?\n\nSome points I see in popping up in the discussion highlighted by the quotes:\n\n1.\u00a0 Automated matching:\n\n<blockquote>\" <a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/03/whats_making_this_labor_market.html?cm_sp=blog_flyout-_-cs-_-whats_making_this_labor_market#comment-470394513\">Last year (or the year before?) the employment system spent $1.3B on </a><a href=\"http://monster.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Monster.com</a><a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/03/whats_making_this_labor_market.html?cm_sp=blog_flyout-_-cs-_-whats_making_this_labor_market#comment-470394513\"> alone.

You have better chances winning the lottery than popping up as a good match in an HR database query. Using automated tools to sort through the data may sound like a good idea, but, unless the recruiters are also exceptionally talented, it will just provide an excuse for poor hiring decisions to mediocre medium-level staff who try to not hire others for a living. It is, after all, much safer to claim that you could not find anyone to fill a position, rather than take a decision which may at some point in the future come to haunt you.</a>\"\n\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/03/whats_making_this_labor_market.html?cm_sp=blog_flyout-_-cs-_-whats_making_this_labor_market#comment-470924602\"> </a>\" <a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/03/whats_making_this_labor_market.html?cm_sp=blog_flyout-_-cs-_-whats_making_this_labor_market#comment-470924602\">Lchanio: You raise a very important point. \"Poor automated matches, combined with a rigorous selection process\" ...\u00a0\u00a0is what everyone is hiding behind. HR knows the matches are poor, but emphasizes the \"rigorous\" process they use to scour the databases. They debate which databases are the best. But they fail to get their butts up from the chair behind the pc screen to actually go out and recruit. (Remember recruiting? I once did an entire workshop for an association of HR recruiters titled, \"Recruit Is A Verb.\"). </a>\n\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/03/whats_making_this_labor_market.html?cm_sp=blog_flyout-_-cs-_-whats_making_this_labor_market#comment-470924602\">The rigor of \"the process\" hides the total failure of the process. Older professionals face a double whammy. It's easy to discriminate out of ignorance when you can blame the lack of a match on the database. No need to interview anyone and make a judgment.</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/03/whats_making_this_labor_market.html?cm_sp=blog_flyout-_-cs-_-whats_making_this_labor_market#comment-470924602\"> </a><a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/03/whats_making_this_labor_market.html?cm_sp=blog_flyout-_-cs-_-whats_making_this_labor_market#comment-470924602\">I don't like to sound like a total cynic, but the recruiting and hiring process is overwhelmingly corrupted. When you're spending billions of HR dollars on just one job board, it's already too late. Your infrastructure has been swallowed whole. There is no way out.</a> \"\n\n</blockquote>\u00a0\n\n2. People hiring focusing on potential vs. exactly matching experience:\n\n<blockquote>\u00a0 \" <a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/03/whats_making_this_labor_market.html?cm_sp=blog_flyout-_-cs-_-whats_making_this_labor_market#comment-470405968\">This is the first time that I have looked for a job in 34 years. Now there is a \"Berlin Wall\" of HR that must be satisfied before an applicant gets exposed to the person they will be working for. In order to be thorough, HR looks for someone who has actually performed the exact task that the company needs filled.\u00a0 They also make sure that the applicants education is exactly what the position requires. IMHO, we don't hire people based on their potential.</a> \"\n\n</blockquote><blockquote>\" <a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/03/whats_making_this_labor_market.html?cm_sp=blog_flyout-_-cs-_-whats_making_this_labor_market#comment-471107927\">In fact, any time a technical skill is required for a job I'm willing to bet hr will forward all resumes that have some of the keywords in it. When I have an open position hr sends me every resume they get it seems. I'm the one turning down the ones I don't like. I'm more inclined to believe hiring managers are to blame. They need to be willing to think creatively about candidate potential. If there's an exact fit for a job, you're hiring for yesterday's job opening instead of tomorrow's. I want the guy/gal who can take me someplace better, rather than do exactly the same thing he last employee did before they quit.</a> \"\n\n</blockquote>\u00a0\n\n3.

A community of people who lead alternative lives and seek for not-so-obvious solutions to emerging social, political, economical problems wants to bring together like-minded people from this fascinating place on Earth and see how you guys are creating resilient futures here in Asia.\n\nAfter the earthquakes in Nepal the starting point for this discussion became obvious. We came right on time to see impressively motivated and active society, with very strong links leading to the most remote places forgotten about politicians and big organisations. Many lives were saved by those heroic but unrecognized efforts, many houses and shelters have been built for them in the same way, and their fields will crop thanks to their voluntary work at this very critical point.\n\nAfter a month of hard work, it is about time to sit and talk/write about your experiences. About your motivations, about your opinions, about the tough and beautiful moments of these difficult weeks behind. We would love to meet you and discuss both the challenges and opportunities for Nepal at this very point of political instability, economical problems and huge social potential, which could be mobilised to create citizen-driven solutions to these issues. We believe each of you is an expert in this domain in some way. This is why we invite you to join the platform and share your thoughts, discuss, bring friends over, meet new people from all over the world and use this common space to generate ideas and spark actions that will contribute to a better future.\n\nJust <a href=\"/signup\">sign up to the edgeryders.eu website</a>, then come back here and click \u201c+ Topic\u201d above to tell us about you and your work.

In Edgeryders we, together, explore the space that all of these trajectories define. How do we work? How do we lead our social lives? How do we learn, and what? Starting with individual experience, we think we can make collective sense of the world this generation is building.\n\nFor effective exploration, we have divided individual trajectories into themes. It is an abstraction, of course: our lives are a whole, and all of their aspects are interrelated. But it is an useful one, because it helps the community to shift its attention in sync, and this should make for more engaging conversation and better data. Themes are explored through <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/campaigns\"><strong>campaigns</strong></a>, each lasting three to four weeks. The themes are:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/campaign/bootcamp\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Bootcamp</strong></a>: sharing and commenting personal stories, learning to use the platform</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/campaign/making-living\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Making a living</strong></a>: finding work, creating one\u2019s work, social innovation</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/campaign/caring-commons\"><strong>Caring for commons</strong></a>: how to preserve, enhance and use common resources, both material and informational</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/campaign/living-together\"><strong>Living together</strong></a>: sharing resources, making the most of diversity, managing conflict</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/campaign/learning\"><strong>Learning</strong></a>: education, knowledge sharing, knowledge building: where, how and from whom we learn</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/campaign/we-people\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>We, the people</strong></a>: new channels for participation, democracy and governance for a better world</li>\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/campaign/resilience\">Resilience</a></strong>: are you ready for the worst case scenario?</li>\n\n<li><strong>Finale</strong>: wiki-style editing of Edgeryders\u2019 final report, the Policy Makers Transition Handbook</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nEach campaign is broken down into <strong>missions</strong>. Missions are \u201cpackets\u201d of research that can be carried out by a single Edgeryder, or a small group, with a few hours of work. They are going to be based on individual experience. For example, we could target a mission of the Making a living campaign at the problem of how employers are able to spot talent and match it with their needs. Some of the most valuable skills around are difficult to document and pack into standardized recruitment process, and many people find that the most talented people are often left waiting on the sideline while more conformist thinkers get the job. So we could make a mission that asks: have you ever been interviewed for a job? Tell us about the experience. What was your impression of the recruitment process? What do you think recruiters were looking for? Did you have the feeling that a candidate\u2019s success or failure were based on some solid criteria or somewhat random?\n\nThe mission is completed by writing a <strong>mission report</strong> with the requested information. For each completed mission, Edgeryders are awarded reputation points (or <strong>reps</strong>) every time they complete a mission.", "created_at": "2011-10-05 16:57:55", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:00.841238", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 582, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26048, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 726, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>The virtuous cycle of non-excluded people blazing the trail</b>\n\nTraffic <i>is</i>\u00a0scary, for everyone. In my home region, Emilia-Romagna, we have a strong cycling tradition \u2013 it is unusually flat for Italy, and that helps.\u00a0When I moved to Milano in 2001, I found cycling much more difficult because of a deadly combination of cobblestones, tram tracks and just sheer traffic nastyness.\u00a0Bicycle lanes where almost absent. As a consequence, only \"extreme cycling\" happened: young, fit\u00a0men who wore tactical backpacks, army boots and yelled at drivers, and even kicked at their cars. I could just about cope: my (Swedish) wife refused to cycle, saying it was too dangerous. Extreme bikers did things like this:\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/1/11a17d67f639a63ee13b23948ecf39e174f423ba.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"359\">\n\nBut over the years those extreme people have become sort of cool. A company called <a href=\"http://www.urbanbm.it/\">Urban Bike Messengers</a> established a bicycle-based delivery service. They cultivated an image of green, cool and a bit scary. Rumour was that, to become a messenger, you had to pass a near-impossible test of crossing the city only in minutes. This encouraged more people to go out and bike. This, in turn, made biking a little safer for everyone, because drivers learned to be a little more attentive. So even more people got out. By the time I left the city, the Decathlon shop in Cairoli was selling 50 to 100 bicycles\u00a0<em>a day.</em>\u00a0Eventually, the city council started to take\u00a0cyclists a bit more seriously; traffic was restricted in the center, some slightly better bike lanes appeared.\u00a0\n\nWhat this story has to teach is that, perhaps, if you want to make life better for paraplegics you have to start from the urban sport enthusiasts. Which is, after all, the same old story of finding a group of\u00a0early adopters that pave the way (literally, in this case) for everyone else.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-10-04 14:15:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:23.987206", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 363, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 510.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16935, "user_id": 81, "topic_id": 1125, "post_number": 3, "raw": "The last point is definetly an excellent development.

Because I'm classed as being on a low-income, the course fees have been subsidised and I've paid about \u00a3800 so far for half a degree. The funding structure is different now due to forced government changes. It'll still be cheaper and the OU fought for the right of their new (part-time) students to be eligible for loans with the same terms as \"normal\" students, but I don't think I would have probably started studying if I'd had to sign up for that much debt.\n\nThe disability services are great too, much better than at any IRL educational establishment I've attended.\u00a0The teaching standard has been excellent, the materials are very well designed (I wish there was a way to buy the resources without necessarily doing all the courses) and I really don't have any complaints.\n\nI even got a computer grant when I started, as I didn't have one of my own.\n\nThe module websites &amp; forums are the most valuable for me, but it does make a significant difference if you attend the tutorials/day schools. I did much better from the start on the courses where I could attend them, something about feeling part of the community &amp; it being easier to interact with tutors that you've met rather than starting cold. There are online tutorials using Elluminate between physical tutorial sessions, using conferencing software which I also find useful.\n\nThere are super helpful (unofficial) Facebook groups as well, running parallel to the course forums. I only bothered looking recently &amp; must have missed out significantly for my first course as there's a lot of valuable discussion there.\n\nRe synchronous contact - for the design modules, there's been a focus on practical skills like technical drawing, photography &amp; prototyping alongside the more academic, and I haven't felt limited by the tuition format. There have been companion manuals/workbooks to work through which have been helpful, and for me the main benefit of this kind of study is that it is self-directed. We're run through things at tutorials sometimes, and can phone tutors, but I think it's more valuable to learn these kind of things by trial and error rather than being shown &amp; getting it right first time. Maybe that's just how I learn best but I've been surprised by how well me &amp; my coursemates have got on with \"harder\" skills. I don't know if the OU attracts people who prefer to work in that way or if the materials are that good, but I haven't heard any complaints on that front.\n\nThe use of technology in course delivery &amp; design is pretty innovative, the first course I did won some sort of award for this. Lots of video, audio files, realtime communication, interactive systems (we had an online portfolio/design studio for one, so we could all feed back on each other's work). I think this is a large part of what makes it effective.\n\nSocially, I feel part of a community &amp; we seem to all support each other well. I think the fact that the majority of us are not stereotypical students &amp; have to juggle other responsibilities makes us all quite respectful and encouraging. Everyone seems to have perspective &amp; their eyes on long-term goals, which is satisfying. People are (generally) studying for explicit reasons rather than doing it because it seems like what you're meant to do.\n\nI wouldn't have been able to get into a \"proper\" university or afford to so this might be slightly rose-tinted, but I've had a wholly positive experience with the Open University.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-07-10 13:07:43", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:14.874978", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 681, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28083, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 2858, "post_number": 12, "raw": "<b>Can someone add the last paragraph to the Arabic version?</b>\n\n<a href=\"/u/gazbia_sorour\">@gazbee sorour</a>\u00a0or <a href=\"/u/hazem\">@Hazem</a>?

I consider that I've been trying to develop a concept of a component-oriented view of computing systems, focusing more on technical qualities than social. I understand that the Web is utilized for communications across a broad range of interests. I would not wish to oversimplify or to politicize the essential nature of the media. Personally, I'm very much concerned to avoid any sort of \"Silo-oriented design.\" I consider that the wonders of the Anthropocene have not been all too happily wondrous, and I believe that there is a sense of a linear determinism that may seem to color much of the designs of the same. Not as if to dispense with every sense of design science,\u00a0 however, I simply think it is good to avoid \"Pigeon holes,\" especially in a volatile world.\n\nPersonally, I would not want to become too attached to any single manner of a technical thesis concept. If I've begun to develop a manner of a component-oriented view about computing systems, it is not without that view deriving -- of course -- from some existing component architectures. I'm afraid I\u00a0 may not be able to produce any too succinct summary of this view.\n\nFor a short number of months, I've been studying the architecture of the FreeBSD operating system, specifically, and some of the characteristics of the Android operating system. With regards to Google's principal management of the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), I understand that they've published a wide range of source code repositories, and that Google themselves must certainly interact with a number of commercial Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) offices, such as namely of companies that are developing mobile computing platforms applying the Android operating system. Of course, Android applies a Linux kernel, along with the respective Dalvik or ART Virtual Machines, then any number of Google service components and OEM service components in any single OEM Android platform.\n\nAlternate to the AOSP Android Distribution, there's also CyanogenMod -- functionally, a fork of the AOSP codebase. CyanogenMod can be installed to Android devices, albeit such that might serve to void OEM warranties. Theoretically, a custom platform could be developed with either the AOSP baseline or CyanogenMod.\n\nAdditionally, there's the Tizen platform, also developing a principally mobile operating system on a Linux kernel. Tizen is managed primarily by Samsung, but there is a broad and -- I think -- well organized contributor model for Tizen.\n\nCandidly, I would not want to seem as if it was any manner of a proposal for a \"Gilded Carrot.\" Simply, the Android, CyanogenMod, and Tizen operating systems can each be applied to develop something of a custom mobile platform -- ostensibly, not only for commercial applications. I'm not certain if it may seem too daunting to formal humanitarian aid institutions. Theoretically, a mobile operating system can be developed specifically for support of humanitarian relief work.\n\nThat, I believe, is to\u00a0 my own sense principal interest. Furthermore, I hope that the Tizen project may consider that a FreeBSD kernel may be applied alternate to a Linux kernel, and a mobile operating system developed -- alternately -- from a FreeBSD ports model. However, Linux has been more widely applied in mobile computing platforms. There are specific kernel drivers available with Linux, such that have not -- as yet -- been ported to FreeBSD, and such that may be particularly useful for mobile computing, such as in regards to NAND type file storage.\n\nOf course, I am not of a want to get that mixed up with any specifically commercial development, on Web media or otherwise.\n\nI understand that Edgeryders may be focused more principally about Creative Maker support, in a sense, alternate to any focus as specifically about support of humanitarian relief services. Personally, having read the text of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Agenda 2030, and being aware of some of the ongoing crises abroad to the US, I believe I am more personally concerned about humanitarian relief support than -- <em>per se</em> -- creative marketing. I would not wish to suggest as if -- in a manner of practical domains -- as if those respective domains were altogether exclusive to, in each, the other. I think that there may be something of a serious nature to humanitarian relief support, overall.\n\nAlternate to a concept of developing a mobile humanitarian relief support software, I'm afraid that\u00a0 my geographical position in the West US would effectively limit my immediate personal interactions with Edgeryders in the EU. Personally, I am not uncomfortable with a \"Socially orbital\" role. I would not wish to seem excessively critical of the Enterprise climate in the US, but I believe we have been doing too much of \"Thinking in Silos.\"\n\nIf personally I may be able any manner of formal or informal web support, I've begun developing a small logical\u00a0 model about the FreeBSD operating system, titling it AxonP -- focusing specifically about systems administration with the FreeBSD ports architecture, but not ignoring contexts of normal \"Business day\" activities and technical \"Help Desk\" support activities, in broad. I've managed to put together an albeit none too detailed logical model, in a BPM format: An <a href=\"https://www.evernote.com/shard/s490/sh/2640bb34-f812-4167-8759-85deb981fe9e/6ca86e4eba0fa2b47bf41c44278d0aa2\">AxonP Process Model, draft nr. 1</a>, edited in the Cubetto BPMN model editor\u00a0 on an Android tablet.\n\nIf there may be a forum specifically about Android support, here at Edgeryders, personally I would be happy to offer advice with regards to specific apps on Android. Candidly, in a manner of a commercial perspective, I don't believe it's easy to monetize Android support, but I've heard of microdonation systems such as with <a href=\"https://www.changetip.com/\">ChangeTip</a> moreover. Of course, regardless of any manner of a simple novelty of the Android platform, the Web media may be utilized also from a desktop architecture.\n\nConsidering the prevailing concerns of humanitarian crises and the will to express creatively, I hope that no commercial consideration would cast any manner of a tall shadow on my interactions here at Edgeryders.\n\nPersonally, I think it is helpful to aspire to a demanding project, in life, but not as if to narrow one's views into a pigeon hole.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-11-13 22:51:23", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:04.843390", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1079, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [21588], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6282, "user_id": 2569, "topic_id": 6249, "post_number": 1, "raw": "This is a work in progress idea for the OpenVillage.\n\n<span><strong>Big Question:</strong></span>\n\n<strong>How can Britain and Europe work together, post-Brexit, to provide a humane and safe environment for asylum seekers and refugees across the continent?</strong>\n\n<span><strong>My background:</strong></span>\n\nWorked on the Ground in Calais 2016.

It has the potential for a lot\u00a0of moving parts, but i think it's achievable given the timescale. The biggest hurdles would be securing buy in from Good Chance Theatre to create the space, and finding ways to support grassroots volunteers to travel to, and stay in, Brussels to meet, share and talk.\n\nTypical ER problems i guess.\n\nLet me know any thoughts you have about the idea.

The original idea was developed for mixtures of materials, so I'll use this as a comparison sometimes.\n\nImagine you have a bag of 10l of water and you add another 10l of apples into the water. The bag of only water felt not very rigid of course. The bag full of apples <em>was </em>relatively rigid. Both together are almost like the water before (unless you press really hard). So rigidity of one material somehow \"got lost\". If you'd finely mix the apples into a sort of watery apple sauce - you get slightly different properties again. So basically things depend not only on the individual constituents but also on their arrangement (e.g. large pieces vs small pieces).\n\nYou can translate this into a social context by assuming you have only two types of persons in a ratio of 1:1. You can still build very different societies by homogenizing or polarizing. Or clumping the \"apple people\" together and surrounding them with \"water people\" or vice versa. You can also build a \"layer cake society\" or a \"statistically random society\" (although that is probably much harder than it sounds, because certain constituents usually attract or repel each other).\n\nNow imagine you have you have 9 parts pretty much electrically insulating plastic, and 1 part highly electrically conducting metal.\n\nIf you throw them together you don't necessarily get 9 x conductivity of plastic + 1 x conductivity of metal (and then divided by 10). If we assume the metal pieces are little round balls we would need more than 10 volume % (1 part in 10) to make the stuff conductive. And if we put in a little more metal (e.g. 11%) - almost no change in conductivity is visible. So we add a little more - and again nothing. And a little more - again almost nothing. And a little more - and we get a tiny change. And a little more - and the change is <strong>gigantic</strong>! Sometimes less than 0.1% addition changes the conductivity by a factor of more than 1000!\n\nTranslated to our society example it would mean: Even if you interview people in the streets and make a statistic of a certain opinion - there is almost no change visible at all, initially. But at some point many people have 2 friends within their group who share that specific opinion. Most of these friends also have <em>some</em> connections who share this opinion - and thus a network (a pretty much endless cluster) has appeared.\n\nIf people know whom of their friends share this opinion and it is something they are passionate about, then a lot of things can change pretty drastically in a short time for a society. How much it wil change, will often depend on how long the quality of the connection remains \"high\" - even when you have to connect through several friends of friends.\n\nSocietal dynamics can flip, even though there may only be a tiny increase of people with their opinion (or just a change in <em>their</em> awareness/paradigm/narrative) - and they remain a very small minority. If they are in touch through an unbroken connection and can coordinate (propagate signals), they have reached what can be called tipping point, or percolation threshold.\n\nWhat is required for this is not even necessarily making any sort of addition - only some re-arrangement that allows individuals (or groups) with shared interest to find and coordinate over long distances. And if one has seen this work a few times it can become a powerful self fulfilling prophecy - hardly possible to turn the wheel back on this.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-22 20:08:34", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:18.089144", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 687, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 6.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [23886], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24054, "user_id": 2802, "topic_id": 4772, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>friday eve going out</b>\n\nHi all\n\nFriday eve it is perfect for me @Alex_Stef and @Ruxandra\n\nSorry for the late reply, I did not get these messages, I am here in Bucharest :)\n\nWho else is in? \u00a0Where should we meet?\n\nSee you soon\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-09-11 05:58:18", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:13.335025", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 59, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27867, "user_id": 2657, "topic_id": 4474, "post_number": 8, "raw": "Hi everyone!\n\nI am exciting to get to know you all, and to be introduced.

Because we strongly want this Heritage to be of everyone, not just of few\u2026\u201d Malastrada.film, 2006</em>\n\n\u00a0\n\nMalastrada.Film is a cultural association founded in 2004 in Patern\u00f2 (Catania) by Alessandro Gagliardo and Giuseppe Spina (22 years old). In 2006 they collaborated with Antonio Longo and Christian Consoli to produce the documentary \u201c13 variations on a Baroque theme. A ballad to the oilmen of Val di Noto \u201d (13 variazioni su un tema barocco. Ballata ai petrolieri della Val di Noto) through a bottom-up production: they collected more than 700 co-producers that gave 10 \u20ac dues.\n\nTheir main purpose was to give evidence to the upcoming drilling that 4 American Oil companies were going to do with the endorsement of the Regional Parliament (ARS) in 4 different areas of the Sicily region.\n\nOne of the 4 areas was the so called \u201cVal di Noto\u201d, south-east area of the island worldwide known as a baroque homeland and recognized by the Unesco in its World Heritage List. With the insertion in the list the life and the economy of the area was radically changed: tourism, biological agriculture and so on. The drillings would threatened all the positive changes that had been built in the last years and so farmers, entrepreneurs, students and all the residents have begun protests, but attention to them was poor.\n\nThe documentary supports the NoTriv Committee (Committee against drilling for the renewable energy) with the aim to bring the fight to the attention of the national media.\n\nThe project was immediately supported by national newspapers like La Repubblica and L\u2019Espresso, by associations, several radios, popular musicians and also several websites among them creativecommons.it (from the beginning Malastrada.Film decided that the documentary would have been distribute with a Creative Commons licence).\n\nThe financing system was definitely successful: Malastrada.film was able to collect 500 on-line subscriptions and around 250 (of 10 \u20ac each) off-line. They got the budget they needed and 1000 euro extra on top.\n\nThe co-producers of the documentary are not only from Sicily. Some co-producers, especially people that were living or working nearby the drilling areas, they subscribed their quote and were themselves part of the shootings, arguing their ideas about the happenings. Other co-producers promoted the project, others found subscriptions, others organized the projections all around Italy.\n\nThanks to the documentary the complaints for the drillings reached the national newspapers and TV, \u00a0the natives asserted their interest to public policies that should have protected their own national heritage and all these was a strong signal that had contributed to the block of the drilling.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI think that this story is an example of how artistic tools can become everyone tools, in this case for the protection and the defense of the own land as a threatened commons.\n\nBut I ask me if is possible find a way to facilitate this conception and this use of the creative tools like everyday and everyone tools and, why not, as freedom tools also in a long term and not only in a danger situation\n\n\u00a0\n\nparts of the documentary\n\n<a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x10il4_13-variazioni-su-un-tema-barocco_news\">http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x10il4_13-variazioni-su-un-tema-barocco_news</a> with subtitles\n\n<a href=\"http://video.repubblica.it/copertina/sos-barocco-13-variazioni-su-un-tema-barocco-la-storia-delle-trivellazioni/8616/10549\">http://video.repubblica.it/copertina/sos-barocco-13-variazioni-su-un-tema-barocco-la-storia-delle-trivellazioni/8616/10549</a>\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-02-24 01:17:32", "updated_at": "2017-08-29 06:48:59.265205", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 649, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30292, "user_id": 1442, "topic_id": 4918, "post_number": 12, "raw": "<b>Regarding typeface/font </b>\n\n@Nadia @Noemi\n\nWHat is the correct typeface to use to write Opencare?\n\nit is not clear in the information I read above.\n\nIs it Montserrat OR\u00a0Helvetica Bold?\n\nYou mention and use both above.

The weekly newsletter:</strong>\u00a0Goes out to the whole Edgeryders community to engage them in the project. The Newsletter is sent out every Saturday morning with news for the coming week. You are expected to add your own project - related news. How: \u00a0find the upcoming newsletter-in-progress\u00a0in the <a href=\"/t/about-the-team-social-media-category/444\">Social Media Group</a>.

Challenges are not limited to a number or topics, so you can improve their copy\u00a0or propose entirely new \u00a0ones.\n\n5. <strong>One Working out Loud blogpost each\u00a0month</strong>: summarizes Op3n Care events led by various community members or team members; shares\u00a0insights from the online conversation and ends with a Call to action explaining how anyone can get involved at that stage.\n\n5. <strong>One trimestrial Webinar each</strong>: Please come up with an \\#opencare related topic for a webinar to be held by you. This is important because it is \"goodies\" like these that power an effective engagement campaign.

At the political level the EC is currently tackling data-monopolies through conventional means but this is clearly not enough. For context, please read this post summarising key discussions during the event: <a href=\"/t/shaping-the-future-of-digital-social-innovation-in-europe-what-was-discussed-during-digisi/4118\">https://edgeryders.eu/en/blog/shaping-the-future-of-digital-social-innovation-in-europe-what</a>\n\nFabrizio wishes to contribute to this effort by building an appropriate research program and getting member states to accept it.\n\n<em>Sestini: \"....Problem: when we talk about distributed, different people mean different things. Data storage, data management, do we need a different internet? What is technically or practically are the directions we should investigate and priorities ?\" </em>\n\n<em>Morozov:</em> <em>\"the biggest contribution you can make is to show that there is alternative mode of action to the mode of action imposed by silicon valley. Take a device, release all the data it collects...and then make app for experimenting with it. In a way that does not require us to pay one dollar to a developer in Slilicon Valley. A key to that is the ability to compare notes, and you cannot do that currently because devices are locked. And because an economy has emerged in selling us solutions. So you need to fund a project that will take problem currently being solved in a commodified way, and tackling it differently. That is the argument you can then make to cities and governments that the problems they currently cannot solve and that citizens now have to pay to solve...can be tackled differently. But this not about open data. The problem you have is that of the providers of solutions.\" </em>\n\nFabrizio told people in the room that If we wish to see the EC support work on distributed architectures, we need to help him and others build a case for this. To succeed in this endeavor he believes we would need to make a proposal that touches three levels:\n\n<strong>A. Strategic level</strong> - <em>The problem is that when we talk about distributed, different people mean different things. Data storage, data management, do we need a different internet? What is technically or practically are the directions we should investigate and priorities? Right now if we ask people, some will say put all the money in crypto. Others will say data storage. What is a strategically sound plan for what to prioritise in which order?</em>\n\n<strong>B. Technical level</strong> - <em>How do we shape a research agenda? It is very difficult- we need to answer the question of what could be desirable (from political perspectives) outcomes of a 10 million Euro investment in research? What is the required level of funding required in order to have an impact?</em>\n\n<strong>C. Political level</strong> - <em>How do we build a political case and sell it at the level of national governments? Many of which are actively pushing policies at odds with the agenda of decentralised solutions- which in turn depends on public opinion. We need to make the case through examples and cases which are clear and easy to understand, also for those not working in/with technology. \"We need to produce a pedagogical description of distributed architectures. Starting with defining basic concepts. Think questions like \"what is a blockchain\" and replies like \"Blockchains are chains of contracts stamped with timestamps that cannot be faked\" + clear explanation as to why this is the case. So people feel they have a clear understanding. </em>Some examples provided by participants in the meeting included resilience of storage (so we are not screwed by central points of failure), finance/online payment and credit cards.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Who does the work calls the shots</h3>\n\nIn the next couple of weeks a meeting will be held in Brussels during which a proposal for a large research program will be drafted and then sent to the member states to approve.\u00a0 In order to make the most of the opportunity, those of us who with to see Europe move in this direction might do well to prepare a shared agenda for what we want to see in the proposal so that we are coherent and consistent. It's also a good opportunity for people trying to tackle the consequences of various socialecological, economic and political crises in Europe to\u00a0 think strategically about how we can align our work in different areas to contribute to such a development.\n\nIf you wish to work on this with me, please leave a thoughtful comment about the contents of <a href=\"/t/shaping-the-future-of-digital-social-innovation-in-europe-what-was-discussed-during-digisi/4118\">this blogpost</a> (post them on the blogpost page, not here, please).

They confirmed what @Alberto have written to me in email where he shared his opinion about this post (unpublished by @Nadia at that time) - people running Comitato Matera 2019 do work on strategy which doesn't require 'winning' ECOC title!

In theory yes, I could! In practice maybe I just didn't feel in power to search for nicer path and just didn't want confusion around the ECOC kept making me feel sick. I don't remember us having mature discussions around this topic, on contrary I can recall many gossips including <a href=\"/u/bembo_davies\">@Bembo Davies</a> sharing on random occasions some of his dramaturgic fantasies around this theme. Us deciding to put MT2019 on: outside of <span>discussion</span> rethinking our direction list, didn't contribute to creating optimistic atmosphere for clarifying something we somehow managed to keep rather blurry.\n\nYesterday I also had chance to re-meet <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/andrea.santantonio.54\">Andrea</a><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/andrea.santantonio.54\"> Santantonio</a> after hearing him asking very relevant question during Q&amp;A round of the panel discussion.

I hesitated shortly but in the spirit of <em>let's try it and see what happens</em> I placed it on my chest.
