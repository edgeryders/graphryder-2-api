We started our project RefugeesWork to help newcomers to connect with locals who are looking for freelancers to outsource some work to them.\n\nIt all started in August 2015 when lots of newcomers, mainly from Syria, arrived to Germany.\n\nIt now turns out that it\u2019s not very easy for them to find any kind of employment at all. German companies seem to not need the skills they bring to the table and even if they do have what they are looking for, they often reject people who do not speak German well.\n\nWe decided to use our digital skills, first of all programming, to help them. We developed a marketplace app where on one side newcomers can register and describe their skills and on the other side local organizations can post their requests for freelancers. We believe work is the best pathway to connect refugees and locals and to date, we have over 300 registrations on the site and big community in Berlin and online. Those Syrians come from all walks of life and some have excellent background, or were running their own business.\n\nBut we also realized that freelance requests are mostly for freelancers with web and mobile development background. These are the jobs freelancers can do online, they don't need to speak the local language and because all the organizations are trying to automate their processes, there is actually a big need for these professions. We checked our database and available statistics and figured out that most of newcomers are young, they just finished their high school or had to leave in the middle of their studies so they actually lack necessary skills to integrate into the highly specialized German job market. Freelancing would give refugees freedom from discrimination they would face otherwise and freelancers are usually paid way better. The tricky part is in making sure there is a regular flow of work. That is our experience.\n\n\nRefugeeswork.jpg960x638 84.1 KB\n\n\nTherefore we decided to extend our Berlin based coding school for kids and use our experiences to create online e-learning platform to teach newcomers programming: from how to install browser to how to build your mobile app. All the learners can learn digital skills/programming no matter where they are, they get 24/7 support on the chat from mentors and other learners and later and they can apply for projects companies outsource through RefugeesWork. All the learners become part of digital collective Coding Amigos, that we started with international crew of developers with activist streak already 3 years ago. We meet in Berlin 2x a week and co-work together on client projects or our own apps that we in long term want to connect in a circular economy. For us - even though circular economy is usually connected to recycling - that means that supply chains form supply circles and money is not loaned by governments and other usual suspects and end up in always the same pockets who save it and don\u2019t even know what to do with all the money.\n\nCurrently we are also following the work of Sensorica in Canada and Enspiral in New Zealand. Our wish is to create a micro-holding co-ownership model. One part of the motivation is to shield these professionals from all kinds of discrimination that they might otherwise experience.\n\nIt shields them, for example from the usual politicking among corporate employees who might tend to put such newcomers into a fairly low place. And another part of the motivation is exploring processes and legal ways for cooperation and decision making between many micro-holdings.\n\nWe try to list all our initiatives inside of Github organization SquatUp.\n\nWe try to keep all our work open and transparent for which we for now use Github.com, Gitter.im and Waffle.io which allow us versioned storing our documents, including code, working on issues on a kanban board and use open communication on a public chat.\n\nAll our projects are made with zero budget so with pure love and dedication for our mission: open source & transparency, inclusiveness, digital literacy and open organization. It is not easy, but we don't want to waste our time chasing funding and investors or clients, but instead co-create the world we want to live in. And we believe right people and opportunities will come from that and from the people that share the mindset and want to join us.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to make a living with all of this, so we just try to live as cheap as possible and we work for a better future where society is organized differently utilizing radical transparency and open source. Until then we live from savings that we sometimes manage to build when working on paid projects. By empowering refugees with skills we hope they will later become our partners and continue to help us build an alternative work. On top of that, we might manage to get in projects on a more regular basis and outsource paid work to each other.\n\nSo if you are a programmer, \u201dapptivist\u201d, please consider reaching out and connect your apps to our ecosystem via API or help us build an open ecosystem of related apps.\n\nIf you know anyone who did not yet start to learn programming, please tell them to join us in http://gitter.im/codingamigos/learners so they can get started for free immediately. We offer 24/7 support for free to get learners from zero to be able to create their first mobile app within a couple of weeks up to a few months given learners are disciplined and learn full time.\n\nAnd last but not least, if you can bring in paid IT projects to support our voluntary efforts, the community of learners and our effort to prototype alternative ways of organizing and working together, we would appreciate it a lot. Everyone who successfully brings in a project and helps us communicating with the customer during the project will be transparently included in the sharing of the revenue.\n\nThe production of this article was supported by Op3n Fellowships - an ongoing program for community contributors during May - November 2016.\n\nLinks:\n\nRefugeesWork - www.refugeeswork.com\n\nOnline JavaScript school - www.wizardamigos.com\n\nCoding Amigos meetup - www.meetup.com/codingamigos\n\nCoding Amigos collective - www.codingamigos.com\n\nSquatUp - https://github.com/SquatUp/projects/blob/master/README.md\n\nNina Breznik - @ninabreznik\n\nAlexander Praetorius - @serapath", "created_at": "2017-11-28 17:32:06.173262", "updated_at": "2020-09-03 15:47:55.293450", "tag_id": 5152, "post_id": 769, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 736}, {"id": 9025, "text": null, "quote": "If you are not a legal entity, you are obviously exempt from any authorization regime, bureaucracy requirements etc. Your scope for action is limited only by the freedom of individuals in your legal system.\u00a0\nOn the downside, unincorporated initiatives cannot easily use some of the services that legal entity can.

Ever since we were diagnosed with cancer until the end of our treatment we both were more than convinced our body could fight this and we eventually would win the battle. We were always pretty fanatic with sports and always had a focus on eating healthy. We immediately started to look for information on how to keep our body in the best shape during the chemo and radiation attack. During the first appointments we had at the hospital with a nurse specialized in cancer treatment, we received a lot of information on the treatment itself and its possible side effects. However, there was no information added on (healthy) food, which products to eat best during treatment or information on the possibility to continue exercising.\nAt home our search started at the internet and we looked up questions like: Is it healthy to sport during treatment? What is the best food to eat? Should we be adding supplements to our daily meals? Who can help to keep my body in the best shape?\nThrough the dietician working at the general practitioners office Carry got a first list of products, which could affect the treatment and also some products to prevent loosing too much weight. We did not know if we had to expect a weight loss, because that is what we all think chemo does to your bodies. What we forget is that you get a lot of medicines to fight the treatment side effects, which have again their own side effects, such as potentially gaining weight (take for example prednisone, one tends to store a lot of body liquids that could cause weight increase).\nThe information from the GPs dietician was not sufficient, therefore we asked for the advice of a dietician at the hospital. During the first appointment we asked all kinds of different questions, but we were shocked by the answers. Before we were ill, we ate very healthy, fresh/fair products, now we got the advice of the hospital dietician to buy ready meals in case we would did not feel well enough to cook. Or in case you would lose weight to eat artificially manufactured nutrition containing ingredients to increase weight.\nCurrently there are all kinds of \u2018food fanatics\u2019 and \u2018health hypes\u2019. We are convinced that healthy food should not be a trend. We don\u2019t want to focus on trends or hypes; our focus lies at informing people about healthy food and \u201cback to basic\u201d. We want to reach the target group of cancer patients, to help them in finding good food to fight the battle of their life. As we experienced ourselves, medical specialists at the hospital don\u2019t have enough time to guide a patient in the best way and many dieticians follow the \u2018old\u2019 rules and are promoting the medical food of the pharmaceutics industry.\nWe want to start a foundation, which will have a wide network of researchers, specialized food coaches, sport coaches and doctors to gather information and advice, on how to compose healthy menu\u2019s for cancer patients and provide information on healthy ways of exercising during your illness. Not only in general, but also customized, for each individual. Our plan is to set up an overview listing healthy products to eat during your treatment, but also listing products, that are particularly unhealthy.\nNext to that we want build up a network to reach out to people who cannot cook or are not able to exercise (or just walk) on their own. Look around to your own environment. If you were aware that there is a single man/woman, who lives a couple of streets away, which is not able to cook because he/she is too ill, would you not cook (needless to say that this needs to be in line with the advice of the foundation) for that person? This is called community care.Focusing on the hospital food will be the second target (long-term). Once we start informing patients and start working with researchers, food coaches, sport coaches and doctors, we will eventually be able to slowly change the hospital food.\nFiguring out the healthiest ways to fight your battle by staying in direct contact with your target group is part of specialized care, which would be the future in health care.

This is often forgotten (way too often, I'm afraid), even by most \"food fanatics\" or \"health hypers\", who are looking for trendy or aesthetic standards, while forgetting the basics of what makes food. Taking the European population as an example, pasta and rice is not enough for healthy nutrition. A healthy and resilient diet also needs sorghum, buckwheat and quinoa. Modern food trends praise local food, but citizens also crave for bamboo and manioca leaves next to tomatoes and eggplants.

Attraverso un processo di ricerca abbiamo evidenziato come un approccio olistico, che a colpo d\u2019occhio fornisca un quadro clinico completo, comporterebbe indubbi vantaggi a medici e pazienti.\n\n1.2 Acquisizione di idee, spunti, intuizioni\n\nLo spunto iniziale che ha dato l\u2019avvio al progetto \u00e8 scaturito da una serie di interviste condotte tra medici e pazienti. Questi ultimi in particolare lamentavano la scarsa preparazione del medico rispetto al loro specifico caso clinico, delegando pertanto al paziente stesso, la responsabilit\u00e0 nel fornire informazioni dettagliate circa la patologia da affrontare.\n\n1.3 Definizione del problema\n\nIl problema che abbiamo affrontato pu\u00f2 essere definito come una carenza di comunicazione. I diversi professionisti della cura non possiedono, ad oggi, uno strumento semplice e veloce che possa tenerli aggiornati rispetto alla progressione clinica di ogni loro paziente. Le informazioni sanitarie sono disgregate e appartengono allo specialista che le ha prodotte attraverso la propria visita. Queste informazioni tendenzialmente non hanno altro modo di essere condivise, se non attraverso il paziente stesso, cui si delega il compito e la responsabilit\u00e0 di fornire tali informazioni allo specialista successivo.\n\nDoc.doc si propone essenzialmente come un aggregatore di informazioni, un unico database medico nel quale possano essere convogliati e organizzati i dati dei pazienti che si hanno in cura. In questo modo il medico pu\u00f2 affrontare ogni nuova visita avendo gi\u00e0 chiara l\u2019anamnesi pregressa del paziente in questione. Doc.doc inoltre fornisce tutti i contatti degli specialisti che hanno condotto una determinata visita in precedenza, e rende estremamente semplice (un clic) la possibilit\u00e0 di mettersi in contatto con un collega per richiedere un chiarimento o un parere rispetto ai dettagli di una certa una cartella clinica.\n\n2.0 Definizione\n\n2.1 Analisi delle soluzioni\n\nIn seguito ad una estesa sessione di una particolare forma di brainstorming, il brainwriting, sono stati vagliati diversi possibili approcci per affrontare il tema proposto dal bando OpenCare. Questi sono stati categorizzati in modo sistematico secondo la tecnica detta delle 4Cs (le quattro\u201dc\u201d: components, characteristics, challenges, characters) e quindi circoscritti in macro-aree che puntavano ad un certo specifico orientamento verso la risoluzione delle problematiche riscontrate in ambito sanitario.\n\n2.2 Ideazione del concept\n\nIn seguito ai risultati scaturiti dalle tecniche di brainstorming, \u00e8 stato realizzato un questionario da sottoporre ad un certo numero di pazienti, parenti dei pazienti e professionisti della cura (non solo medici, ma anche infermieri, farmacisti, fisioterapisti etc\u2026).\n\nQueste interviste si sono rivelate cruciali nel definire il percorso che doc.doc avrebbe intrapreso.\n\nInfatti, abbiamo riscontrato presso la maggior parte dei pazienti intervistati, una sostanziale insoddisfazione riguardo i processi di comunicazione con i propri medici. In particolare, nel caso di patologie particolarmente complesse, dove \u00e8 necessario il coinvolgimento di molteplici specialisti, spesso i medici coinvolti sono parzialmente o totalmente all\u2019oscuro riguardo i progressi dei colleghi nei confronti di uno specifico aspetto nella cura della patologia. La comunicazione di queste informazioni, avviene, ma quasi esclusivamente per mezzo del paziente, il quale \u00e8 costretto ad assumersi la piena responsabilit\u00e0 dell\u2019accuratezza e completezza delle informazioni fornite.\n\n2.3 Proposta della soluzione\n\nIn seguito alla ricerca svolta, \u00e8 stato quindi logico cominciare a pensare alla progettazione di uno strumento gestionale che permettesse ai medici di avere immediatamente disponibili tutte le informazioni concernente un certo paziente, comprese le informazioni di contatto dei colleghi responsabili di una certa visita.\n\nAbbiamo cos\u00ec progettato uno strumento gestionale che facilita l\u2019organizzazione degli appuntamenti di un medico, ordina in maniera chiara le cartelle cliniche dei pazienti per tipologia e cronologia, permette in un clic di contattare un collega tramite telefono, chat o email, infine rende pi\u00f9 efficiente la visita stessa poich\u00e9 doc.doc consente al medico curante di aggiornarsi circa i progressi del proprio paziente nei minuti precedenti alla visita.\n\nDoc.doc infatti pu\u00f2 essere programmato per concedere uno spazio di tempo (tendenzialmente 10 minuti) tra una visita e l\u2019altra, che permetta al medico di prendere visione della cartella clinica del paziente che sta per incontrare.\n\n3.0 Sviluppo\n\n3.1 Progettazione e prova del prototipo\n\nDoc.doc allo stato attuale consiste in un prototipo interattivo realizzato attraverso la piattaforma proto.io.\n\nPrima di ottenere questo risultato abbiamo sostenuto una approfondita analisi UX che ci ha consentito di effettuare scelte precise circa lo sviluppo di certe funzionalit\u00e0.\u00a0In particolare, attraverso tecniche di Brainwriting e alcune empathy map abbiamo circoscritto l\u2019ambito di lavoro.\n\nA seguito di alcune interviste di orientamento con pazienti e professionisti sanitari abbiamo definito ulteriormente gli obiettivi del progetto, concentrandoci su una \u201cone primary task\u201d, che nel caso di doc.doc consiste nell\u2019aggregazione semplificata dei dati di ogni paziente. Considerando quindi alcuni ipotetici scenari di utilizzo del nostro servizio (presso specialisti\u00a0o medici di base, in studio o in visita a domicilio etc\u2026) abbiamo sviluppato una prima logica di user flow e infine la sua realizzazione grafica interattiva, della quale si pu\u00f2 avere una tangibile esperienza d\u2019uso qui: http://bit.ly/2oOXbmK (una volta scaricata l'intera\u00a0cartella \u00e8 sufficiente aprire il file index.html con il proprio browser, meglio se Chrome).\n\nInoltre in seguito allo sviluppo del prototipo \u00e8 stato condotto un piccolo usability testing\u00a0che ha evidenziato piccole problematiche, immediatamente risolte con il rilascio della versione successiva, di cui si pu\u00f2 prendere visione al link sopracitato.\n\n3.2\u00a0Prova della fruibilit\u00e0\n\nE\u2019 stato condotto un piccolo usability testing, parzialmente moderato, che ha sostanzialmente confermato tutti gli obiettivi di usabilit\u00e0 stabiliti a monte. In particolare i nostri utenti test sono stati, per la maggior parte, in grado di portare a termine le operazioni richieste, quali: 1. Consultare una cartella clinica, 2. Consultare la rubrica pazienti e professionisti, 3. Aggiungere un nuovo appuntamento, 4. Contattare un collega. In questa fase abbiamo ritenuto prematuro considerare ulteriore metriche di controllo oggettive quali tempi e statistiche di errore, concentrandoci piuttosto su misurazioni di gradimento soggettive e mantenendo come unico conteggio obiettivo il numero di operazioni portate a buon fine.\n\nSono stati riscontrati alcuni problemi nella fruibilit\u00e0 dei dati della cartella clinica e delle funzionalit\u00e0 ad essa collegate (\u00e8 infatti possibile anche iniziare una conversazione\u00a0con un collega). L\u2019organizzazione dei contenuti di quella determinata schermata \u00e8 stata quindi modificata sulla base dei feedback ricevuti, cos\u00ec come l\u2019intero look&feel dell\u2019applicazione \u00e8 stato rivisto coerentemente rispetto alle modifiche apportate.\n\n4.0 Rilascio\n\n4.1 Completamento del prodotto/servizio\n\nIl prototipo \u00e8 gi\u00e0 stato testato, ma andrebbe ulteriormente verificato su un campione pi\u00f9 esteso di utenti, seguito eventualmente da un A/B testing.\n\nConclusa la fase di usability testing sul prototipo, si proceder\u00e0 quindi con lo sviluppo di programmazione vero e proprio, la\u00a0cui funzionalit\u00e0\u00a0verr\u00e0\u00a0verificata\u00a0ad ogni milestone raggiunta.\n\nInfine, verranno concepite strategie di distribuzione, idealmente con il coinvolgimento delle ASL locali, per permettere un capillare ed effettivo utilizzo del servizio.\n\n4.2 Rilascio finale\n\nE\u2019 in fase di definizione una timeline di sviluppo che presenti le milestone necessarie al completamento del prodotto, secondo specifiche tempistiche.\n\n4.3 Produzione\n\nIl team di sviluppo tecnico \u00e8 ancora da definirsi, ma stiamo valutando una collaborazione con I-SEE\u00a0(http://www.i-seecomputing.com), specialisti nell produzione di software in ambito medico/ sanitario.\n              \n  \n  \n    \n    Edit\n    Delete\n  \nNo Commentcommunication between doctors\n  \n    \n    Edit\n    Delete\n  \nNo Commentcommunication between doctors\n  \n    \n    Edit\n    Delete\n  \nNo Commentcontinuity of care\n  \n    \n    Edit\n    Delete\n  \nNo Commentdesign intervention\n  \n    \n    Edit\n    Delete\n  \nNo Commentelectronic patient records\n\n  \n    \n    \n      Cancel\nSave\n    \n  \nAnnotate", "created_at": "2017-11-28 17:48:44.840395", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:31:36.083792", "tag_id": 936, "post_id": 33729, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 6578}, {"id": 19790, "text": "", "quote": "Niedawne badania odno\u015bnie tematu sk\u0105d bior\u0105 si\u0119 postawy homoseksualne m\u00f3wi, \u017ce po cz\u0119\u015bci jest to genetyka, ale te\u017c w znacz\u0105cej mierze socjalizacja.

The world needs more economical sources of insulin because 1 in 2 people who need it lack access to insulin worldwide, and this burden falls disproportionately on the poorest communities. Longer term, we hope that by starting with insulin we can broaden our scope to develop more general protein engineering capabilities and provide a practical foundation for small-scale\u00a0groups working in distributed fashion\u00a0to experiment with and produce other biologics.\nWe're very near to reaching our first milestone of producing and isolating proinsulin, after which we'll be redoubling our efforts to develop a simple, end-to-end protocol to produce insulin. We've had several collaborators join our effort in the meantime, including a group at ReaGent in Belgium, another at Biofoundry in Sydney, and another here with us in the Bay Area at Fair Access Medicines.\nWhat have we learned about having citizens define and help advance our research project?\nOur team has benefitted from participation from people with a broad diversity of backgrounds and interests - from veterans of producing biologics at pharmaceutical companies, to people with PhDs and years of work experience in relevant fields, to college students and total beginners who are just interested in starting to learn\u00a0and contribute. The sharing of knowledge and responsibilities\u00a0within our group thus mirrored what we were seeking to support beyond the group.\nHow do we ensure long term sustainability for our project?\nWe originally raised a little over $15k to get started via a crowdfunding campaign, a small budget that has nonetheless proven adequate. We've been fortunate that we've been able to stretch our financial resources a long way with donated and deeply discounted second-hand equipment and reagents, and the contributions of skilled volunteers to keep our equipment running. Thus we have no recurring expenses, which has proven to be the most important way to conserver resources and keep the project sustainable in its high-risk seed phase. This has put us on a firm foundation to\u00a0reach our first milestone, the production and isolation of proinsulin, the first major step on the way to making the mature, active form of insulin. Once that is done, we plan to pursue our next steps and undertake whatever further fundraising effort we may need to do so, possibly involving a distributed ownership structure and holding and sharing of the fruits of our efforts under some sort of peer production license\u00a0to ensure we develop a viable commons around our work.\nChallenges we still face are keeping continuity in the work of the group and preservation and transmission of knowlege as members join and leave the project, something that is becoming more urgent with our developing international collaborations. The urgent questions of distributing the work effectively and making good use of everyone's time and enthusiasm and providing all involved with the support they need has us eager to develop better organization and get people with better organizational skills involved; let us know if you can contribute in these ways!\nHow do we encourage change at policy level?\nWe have learned more about how much we don't know about the complex geopolitics and economics around insulin than about how to directly address the policy dimensions of access to insulin and access to medicine in general. But the fact remains that our fundamental rationale for our work is economical, and has to do with the impact that decentralized production could have immediately and how it could change the landscape of incentives in the longer term to favor better policies.\u00a0\nWe hope our work will have several effects. First, by enabling more production of insulin by more groups, it can increase competition in the market for insulin, which is currently dominated by 3 large manufacturers who face\u00a0criticisms of acting as an oligopoly and lawsuits credibly accusing them of illegally colluding to fix prices. Increased competition might quickly lower costs, bringing insulin into reach for more people, and decentralized production might avoid problems with supply chains reaching parts of the world where it's currently uneconomical to ship centrally-produced insulin. Second, in the longer term, reducing profits from sales of insulin could help to shift economic incentives towards developing better treatments, and ultimately a cure, for diabetes rather than the\u00a0highly costly and inconvenient chronic treatment that those with diabetes must currently live with. This should synergize with the third effect, mentioned before, of making it easier to experiment with biologics by putting the tools for protein production and purification in more hands.\nThen, with these realigned economic incentives around insulin and a cure for diabetes, we can revisit policy questions from a more favorable position, advocating for policies that favor innovation from small-scale groups and revoke the legal privileges large manufacturers have won to protect their oligopolies.", "created_at": "2017-06-27 13:53:43", "updated_at": "2017-06-27 13:53:43", "tag_id": 1253, "post_id": 859, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 826}, {"id": 9089, "text": null, "quote": "Hi all, yesterday (2nd of June) I had a Google Hangout with Noel Carrascal on designing the insulin construct. Relevant to @WinniePoncelet, @BramDeJaegher.\nPost-translational insulin consists of two chains (A and B) that are bonded through disulfide bonds. In humans this is obtained through post-translational modification of a single peptide chain. Such machinery is not available in an E. coli host. Noel is studying how to design the construct for insulin such that a the two parts can reliably find each other.\n\u00a0\nHis design is based on the strong affinity between barnase and barstar. Barnase (resp. barstar) are connected to one of the insulin chains using a linker. When the barnase-barstar complex is formed, insulin should form by proximity. This also circumvents the risk of the formation of two chains of the same kind bonding (A-A or B-B).\n\u00a0\nSuch insuline-barnase-barnstar complexes should aggregate into a large complex of many such molecules, from which pure, functional insulin can easily be cleaved. Admittedly, I did not follow this 100%.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe challenge here is to design such linker as such the complex can be formed. To this end, Noel writes his own software to do mechanistic molecular modelling. He computes all the molecular (polar, Vanderwaals, \u2026) interactions between amino acids to finally obtain the stability of a complex. For a given linker, this is represented by a set of (sparse) matrixes quantifying the strength of the interactions between the amino acids.\n\u00a0\nThis is the point where machine learning comes into play:\n\nUsing a set of example matrices, predict the matrices for new AA chains\nPerhaps use the information to directly build a model to predict stability of a given linker?

In one project taking place at the lab, members are engineering yeast to express milk proteins from non-animal sources - next generation of vegan cheeses and milk. Others are busy developing an eco-friendly bacterial sunscreen.\nOpen Insulin is one of these projects, and its goal is to make it simpler and less expensive to make insulin, starting by investigating some novel ideas for making insulin in e. coli using fewer, easier steps than in common industrial protocols. If successful, the members hope it can be a step towards making generic production more economical, and might also enable more participation in research related to insulin, or production of the medicine at smaller scale, closer to the patients who need it, further reducing costs and giving access to more patients who lack it.\nCounter Culture Labs was founded by a group of hackers with diverse backgrounds and interests in the period from 2011 to 2012, with some members coming from Sudo Room, another hackerspace in Oakland that I participated in founding. Many were also involved in Occupy Oakland, and wanted to establish a more permanent organization with the same community spirit and values. Other members came from Biocurious, another biohacking space in Sunnyvale, in the southern end of the Bay Area. I became involved both because I shared the desire to build a community-focused institution, and because I have diabetes type 1 myself, which means I live with the frustration of costly and tedious treatment regimens day in and day out, and I know how much the standard of care for diabetes patients lags behind what recent research suggests might be possible. So, for my own sake, and for the sake of the others with the condition, I sought to take whatever steps I could to close the gap between the research and what is available to patients on the market right now.\nAbout a year ago, some long-standing discussions around making a bioreactor to produce insulin, which had inspired a few previous attempts, turned more concrete when Isaac Yonemoto, another independent researcher of medical treatments, made some suggestions to us about interesting possibilities for innovation and improvement in existing protocols. We started organising regular meetings, and out of those we then organized a successful crowdfunding campaign, which then opened up connections to professionals who work on various aspects of the problem, both the science and engineering around insulin, and the questions of access to medicine. Through this it came to our attention that access to insulin lags far behind the need even now, and even in the most developed countries - costs of insulin are prohibitive even to many people in the US - and all in all, roughly 50% of those in the world who require it have no access to insulin at all, according to the 100 Campaign, a group working on improving access to insulin around the world. There is almost no generic insulin on the American market at the moment - the first one appeared on the market about two weeks after we finished our crowdfunding campaign last year, but it is a long acting type, which is only part of the therapy required by people with diabetes type 1 (about 15-20% of diabetics in USA have type 1; the rest have type 2). And for those who use an insulin pump, short acting insulin is necessary.\nThe general problem in the first world is that the incentives and interests of producers and patient communities are not aligned.\nRight now we\u2019re focused on achieving the first scientific milestones, which is to produce proinsulin, the precursor of the active form of insulin, in e. coli, in our small-scale community lab. Our lab runs mostly on donated and salvaged equipment and reagents and might be comparable in its capabilities to a lab in a less-developed area of the world where there is the least access to insulin. If we succeed, it would show the possibility that small-scale producers in remote areas might be able to make insulin to satisfy local demand, in places where centrally-manufactured supplies can\u2019t reach due to lack of infrastructure - where what roads there are, if any, do not let refrigerated trucks pass to ship needed pharmaceuticals in. Once we have a protocol that embraces everything from production to purification to near the level of purity of pharmaceutical grade insulin, we plan to approach established generics manufacturers with a case for the economic feasibility of serving the unserved market for insulin, and to partner with them to do the rest of the work of achieving sufficient purity of the product and scaling the methods to production. As we proceed with our work, the main batch of patents around the various forms of insulin are expiring, which will further help us make the case for a comprehensive portfolio of treatments to potential generics manufacturers.\nProvided all this goes well, we might then pursue another idea, closer to our original hope of a bioreactor that produces insulin, and a kind of \u2018holy grail\u2019 goal in the DIY bio world, which is a desktop biofactory, an analog of desktop 3D printers, but for proteins and biologics, which we might develop to first execute one of our protocols to produce insulin, but which we might also design with more flexibility in mind. This would consist of a bioreactor portion that could grow a culture of e. coli or yeast, and then extract and purify a product from it - very roughly speaking, the union of a fermenter with an FPLC, a piece of equipment that purifies proteins. If that is possible, supply of insulin could be placed very close to the demand of the diabetics around the world in a simple, economical package, and reliance on distribution infrastructure would be minimized. It would also reduce the need to have skilled technicians with years of lab experience to execute these protocols by hand.\nUltimately, I hope that opening up the tools for research to more people can help to bring research on cures to patients, and not just treatments. Let me mention a few of the more promising ideas that have had some success in research settings. One approach is to implant functioning pancreatic cells from a donor and protect them from immune attack by various means - hard to scale if you need a constant supply of donors,but it might be possible to grow cultures of the cells in vitro to address this. Another approach is to get the immune system to cease its attack on pancreatic cells, and promote the regrowth of the body\u2019s own insulin-producing cells, either in the pancreas, or in another tissue via gene therapy - a simpler approach to apply once it is developed. Some of the ideas use very inexpensive supplies such as adjuvants, the materials in vaccines that provoke an immune response - and there has been some success using adjuvants alone, or with carefully chosen additions, to get the bodies of diabetic patients to reduce or cease their autoimmune attacks. Other concepts address the metabolic changes behind type 2 diabetes. Several drugs between the research and commercial worlds of medicine can act directly on the metabolic control mechanisms of the body, changing its pattern of energy use and other aspects of metabolism back from the pathological state of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes to the normal, healthy base state. Some of them are small organic molecules, easier to make than proteins such as insulin, but due in part to reasons of cost and incumbency, are not mainstream treatments yet.\nAt the most general level, what we seek to prove is that if an order of magnitude more people get involved in research and development of science and technology, medicine can progress much faster, and might no longer be held back by institutional constraints and perverse incentives in the economics of the institutions. Right now, we\u2019re a group about half a dozen people working regularly on the project, with a few dozen more people in touch every now and then to help out, and a hundred or two in the extended community, ready to answer a question or call for help. Every week or two, someone new comes to the group, who just learned about the project via the media or our regular meetups, and wants to help. Some are complete beginners and end up taking our introductory classes to biohacking, some already have experience but got tired of the limits of the institutions where they worked, or have relatives with diabetes and want to contribute to progress. Though we\u2019re building up a broader community of participation in research slowly, we hope our efforts can plant many seeds out of which future innovations will grow.\nMeanwhile, we are looking to broaden a circle of people who can advise us, experienced scientists and engineers who can help us troubleshoot issues that inevitably come up when investigating the unknown, but we also hope to inspire other groups to work independently in a broader community of innovation. We would like to set up a network of both institutional and DIY researchers living all around the world who have different approaches and ways of making insulin as well as tackling other diabetes and health related issues. Beyond producing drugs, participants might research questions of access to medicine, investigate what patient communities need the most, look at academic publications to identify the most promising research that is not making it out to serve patients, or help establish the effort to build the desktop biofactory. Part of our goal is to prove it\u2019s possible and worthwhile for people outside institutions to take the initiative on these questions, and inspire others to take the lead in their own efforts and bring about the broader changes we seek.\nDo you have any projects in health, medicine, or biohacking that you\u2019d like to work on, but lack people, knowledge, or resources to make it happen?

We are thirsty for knowledge and education, we might be weak, but snowflakes are gentle and weak until they connect, then they become strong. We need to connect, as snowflakes, the youth of the region and the world, only united we can be strong, important, perhaps adults hear us and listen. When children quarrel, they quickly reconcile because its not important to be right, but to be happy. We should accept that we do not have to agree on everything, sometimes can agree to disagree, but we have to respects others' way of life, other people's opinion, that we can discuss about everything, not argue, talking in order to generate ideas, information, positive energy..

Good neighborly relations like friendship and trust builds, slowly and gradually, all that is good and valuable in life, takes time. First we need to forgive. Forgiveness is possible only with understanding, that is why this camp is super idea, to understand together what had happened, impartial, draw lessons from history, in order to continue, this time better, smarter.\n\nThe goal is to make the world a better and more humane place, sustainable, use space in the best possible way, with full respect of nature and population needs, because that's the point of studying, find the best way to reconcile nature and society to meet human needs, give vision of the future, the objectives of the future development.\n\nEverything is connected and the problems must be considered as a system, If one part of the system does not work properly, it reflects on other parts of the system.", "created_at": "2017-11-28 20:11:57.213016", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:31:39.531688", "tag_id": 1109, "post_id": 854, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 821}, {"id": 12891, "text": "", "quote": "I've asked at my local pharmacy, and a friend who worked upstream in the supply chain. The repeated answer is \"not much\".\n\nI asked somebody in my twitter network who is into DIY biotechnology, with a specific question about insulin and he wrote a blogpost saying it wasn't doable right now, and there were things they could work on in the future - apparently it's not simple at all.\n\nI guess it depends. Some medications are generics (doable by several makers) and are already doable more or less in a distributed way, say a factory per 40 million people or less. (That would be a way to measure distributedness, no?) But some are really concentrated in a few working hands.\n\nPart of the trouble is that medications themselves have long and winding supply chains, which in some circumstances (a bad pandemic) are thought to be susceptible to disruption. Here, we're talking about a handful of countries being affected, with \"maker countries\" probably unaffected, or at least less affected. So the supply would be there, it's just that you can't pay for it because you're suddenly poor. If that's the case, then maybe some important medications should just be paid for with international solidarity money. How much and how that's handled, I don't know.\n\nMedications could hypothetically go into a spreadsheet, with how many are affected, how much they are affected, how much medication is needed (people x doses), etc. After appropriate sorting, the spreadsheet would give us 3 categories: \"impossible\" (impossible to do here, so we either import them, or we die), \"possible\" (we need to change how we do things, and we should start looking into \"how\" as soon as we can), and \"done\" (we already make them locally, so they are not really an issue).\n\nMy guess is most medications go into the \"impossible\", but we'd need to ask real experts (world-wide) about \"possible\" and \"done\".\n\nFor our exercise, we'd just have to consider the three categories, and asume each is dealt with differently.\n\nIf there's money or if medications are paid for, transport is not the real problem, because these things are not heavy. Let's go for (I think) high-ish figures, and say 5% of the population need 100 grams of medication a week, that's ... 50000 x 100 / 1000 ... 5000 kilograms per million people and per week. A couple of medium-sized trucks per million and per week. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck_classification\n\nSo, factors are 1) production, 2) payment and 3) transport. (Maybe there are others, like quality control, local distribution, etc, but we can work from those 3 factors.)\n\nJust asking the important questions might take us somewhere - if not now, then later.\n\nJust my 2 cents!\n              \n  \n  \n    \n    Edit\n    Delete\n  \nNo Commentpolitics\n\n  \n    \n    \n      Cancel\nSave\n    \n  \nAnnotate", "created_at": "2017-11-28 20:13:15.844924", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:31:39.642965", "tag_id": 1115, "post_id": 19314, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 1615}, {"id": 9157, "text": null, "quote": "I am also reminded of an interesting aspect of openness.

I have been truly buried in work, and my life got heavily disrupted by personal matters for a couple months.\n@Rune\nI think we have some miscommunication here. I'm not suggesting open source is more reliable, or the only way to go with medical devices. However, there is an issue of transparency of the code to the patient, that has 'similar' issues to the issues of open source.\nOn your other points though, you rightly note that there is a lot of safety and regulation around medical devices. However, we still know that user input issues pervade the safety of medical devices. For examples, see the paper Preventing Medication Errors by \u00a0P Aspden, J Wolcott, J L Bootman, L R Cronenwett:, or any of a number of papers by Harold Thimbleby. The paper Killed by Code written by Sandler et al, also details many case studies that you might be interested in. Getting back to the point about safety regulation, I don't believe that safety regulation takes security into account as regularly. This istarting to happen, but very slowly. This is why the paper \"Pacemakers and implantable cardiac defibrillators: Software radio attacks and zero-power defenses\" is so powerful. They took an FDA certified device, and showed it was possible to make it operate unsafely after some security analysis.\nThere are many more things we might discuss about regulation, such as the FDA's limited resources for looking at the code of the devices. However, there are some good things too, such as the MAUDE database. http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfMAUDE/search.CFM\nBy making this database available, we can search for adverse events and study this in an evidence based approach, as you rightly request.

This led straight into individual and collective reflection and the mapping of questions that mattered to participants. Here, three key issues emerged, which participants gathered in three working groups to address.\nOne group tackled the question of \"How can we provide care and preventative care adequately and accessibly?\" in a process of collective brainstorming and idea development. As a central starting point was the agreement that care and prevention services should be provided by real people for real people, and thus to counteract the further dehumanization in care - both toward those being cared for, but also the caregivers themselves, as has been spreading as a result of the savings and efficiency measures, particularly in the public sector care, such as hospitals and nursing homes,. Based on this arose an idea for central, physical places and spaces in which cross-generational knowledge sharing communities with a decentralized \"bottom-up\" structure can develop. This should activate the local community at large and encourage more people to visit and thus bringing them together. Simultaneously, through the use of modern telecommunications and the Internet, communities that are located in remote areas will be included \u2013 the challenge of inadequate or even non-existent Internet connections in these areas could be countered by open-source technology solutions, such as balloons that are equipped with Internet. The necessary financial resources could be generated by a crowdfunding campaign, also to generate more public attention, especially online, for teaching/learning/exchange spaces for this innovation and strengthen the cohesion of the existing community. A key component of the engagement in these areas could be workshops of all types and themes to be organized, offered and held by participants themselves. These spaces could make a contribution to the initial formulation of questions, because a social community that is open and accessible for all faces the challenge of accessibility to prevention and care, supported by the Internet. Care and prevention again become a matter for the community, and are thus realized in a humane and proportionate way.\nThis common \"bottom-up\" structure was made tangible in a first prototyping, which opened the question \"How can we engage individuals to support these structures, even if they ostensibly do not (yet) benefit from them?\"\nThe prototype incorporated the approach of small and relatively autonomous systems where the supply and demand of communities for health and social themes can not only be met, but also that such knowledge can be bundled onsite and via the internet everyone has access to the spaces. Decisions about the design of health promoting coexistence are shaped by the particpating actors themselves. Finally, assumptions were formulated, which should be examined, scrutinized and discussed in the network in order to make this approach more effective and more efficient. Because even subtle or unconscious perceptions and attitudes can potentially be found in each concept, it needs to be balanced by many, diverse and also conflicting perspectives on the concept to make it more resistant. It was also reflected that a certain basic attitude is required of all potential participants to form these care and prevention networks. Another important point is posed by the question of: \"How can momentum be created for these spaces and networks?\"\nAnother group addressed the question of: \"How can we, based on commonalities, learn more from each other?\" In a idea development and brainstorming process on this issue, the importance of local and personal interaction was recognized. This includes the networking of stakeholders and users, potentially through an interactive map on the Internet such as used by www.berlinimwandel.de. It also requires the organizing of engaging workshops where actors can share their enthusiasm for relevant topics with others by presenting them as relevant themes, and optionally also to demonstrate activities to make them tangible. In addition, activities such as role reversals to expand the individuals' horizons of experience are possible, as is done, for example, in working with \"age suits\" \u2013 young people slip into full-body suits equipped with weights to enable the experience of having an aged body.\nIn a first prototype lifting the existing resources were, theoretically and practically, visualized through a mapping of individual and collaborative networking, both online and offline and person. This process led to the realization that everything is actually there to the realization of this idea already what is needed, when the dedicated actors gathered as OPENandChange workshop, work together and share their resources and combine theory with practice. These assumptions to check it seems important in the first step to begin with themselves, so to make the possibility of designing a different world tangible. This iterative process leads to fresh insights. But the community-based approach not only leads to new insights, but can lead to a higher incidence of fun and joy, and ultimately health and well-being by strengthening group working experiences.\nThe third working group focused on the question: \"How can we increase the societal appreciation for a public welfare oriented social system?\" Also during this idea development and brainstorming process, the need for people to meet in person in \"their\" area, city, country was emphasized. For example, working in interactive groups can lead to an intensification of togetherness and can make prevention and care topic. The supposedly negative connotations otherwise associated with these concepts such as disease, death and a feeling of helplessness are thus transformed. A positive attitude towards the subject is promoted, fears can be reduced, and at the same time the respect and appreciation for the work of nurses and caregivers is increased. In particular, a playful approach to the subject can support this project and convey the idea that all can benefit. Another important aspect for answering the initial question is to explore the current actual situation in care. The question as to why the appreciation in prevention and care sector is so low can lead to valuable information to help find solutions. In prototyping, the motto of \"living appreciation\" was made tangible and concrete: Care and prevention spaces would be established in the middle of society, fulfilling the basic needs of all, which ensures the participation of all so that this approach corresponds to the wishes of all and fulfills their needs. To test this assumption requires a thorough basic research of existing resources, as well as bureaucratic hurdles, and to examine stakeholders, especially those who are not participating.\nBased on the work of the three groups, the following definition of the problems was generated:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Dehumanization of health and social systems \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The focus on treating symptoms rather than promoting healthy lifestyles \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Privatization and capitalization of public goods, which should be accessible to all \nThe concrete solution that the participants collectively devised, states that:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0All we need is there if we work together and share our resources\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0A paradigm shift is needed: \"From Pathogenesis to Salutogenesis\" \u2013 Solidary Health Promotion System with Global Knowledge Network and Local Action Spaces \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Working \"with people for people\" and connect visionaries, experts, institutions and places through concrete actions \nThis solution leads to the following intended:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Employing existing treasures: Mapping for individual and community networking, online and in person, in theory and practice \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Practising appreciation: Create care and prevention spaces in the middle of society to fulfill the basic needs of all and create new incentive/recognition structures in the long term \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Local systemic change: Developing new skills, resources and infrastructure that can be used by all of us: children, young people, adults, seniors (people in all phases of life). \nStrong arguments for the proposal are:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Bottom-up structure with small relatively autonomous systems, who self-regulate the supply and demand of health and social services for individuals and communities \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Only through shared ownership effectiveness and sustainability can this be secured \nOur approaches, technologies and tactics are:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Active participation of ALL leads to a prototype that works for the majority and meets their needs (human-centered development of global platform and local spaces) \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Collective, iterative structure combining theory and practice \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Global Knowledge Network \u2013 CAREPEDIA: bundled knowledge (Internet / platform) all have access to the \"central office\" \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Local Action Spaces: Locally designed and managed spaces for health-promoting coexistence \"From Pathogenesis to Salutogenesis\"\nWe believe our solution will work because: We have existing needs (more than 80% of people want a functional and appreciative system for care and prevention ) and real effects from a dehumanized health and care system. We know many people and institutions that are interested in cooperating and who would gladly contribute their respective expertise. Another world is within reach. There are many projects and movements to prove it. We shall make this even more visible. Everything we need is already there. We need the courage to try it, to experience and live it. We can make an active contribution to this. Financial resources are not a challenge or necessity to achieve this.\nAs expected results \u2013 in the context of existing cases \u2013 we use the following examples: Successful EcoVillages such as Mondragon (a community in the Basque Country without police). Giving spaces, exchange meets and free shops. Micro-agriculture in the city. Urban gardening. Community-supported agriculture creates new relationships between city and land. There are urban farming initiatives in Detroit, critical consumption movements in Italy (GAS), alternative currency systems such as WIR in Switzerland, and solidarity networks for food supply and health clinics in Greece, as well as Networks such as SOLIDAGO and Artabana in Germany. And many more.\nFurthermore, our proposal is confirmed by literature and scientific consensus such as in the field of neuronal research: Fear paralyzes reason and creativity and leads to depression due to stress and alienation . Yet willingness for lifelong learning, creates new neural connections. Further scientific findings such as the Hierarchy of Needs Maslow, the concept of The Ever-Present Origin (Stuttgart 1949-1953) by Jean Gebser, the classic theories of J.M. Baldwin, G.H. Mead, J. Piaget (The Psychology of the Child) and L. Kohlberg as well as related work by C. Gilligan, F. Oser and M. Parsons. Also the literature and research by Ken Wilber, Aurobindo Ghose, Ervin L\u00e1szl\u00f3, Don Beck, and Michael Murphy; \u00a0work on Emotional Intelligence by Daniel Goleman, und the research by Kropotkin, who proved that cooperation is more important than competition in the animal kingdom and is effective for the survival of the group. Also the ample literature on the topics of sustainable lifestyles, Solidarity economy, Holacracy and Sociocracy support our suggested solution.\nHowever, it is necessary to keep sight of the risks. Here there are also a number of examples that could occur either externally or internally: The risk that corporations hijack the ideas and commercialize them, such as happened with Carsharing and CoLiving. External factors such as war, social conflicts, the collapse of the financial system, climate change and its consequences, privatization of public goods such as drinking water, and environmental disasters could endanger our plans.\nBut also our inner monsters, such as greed and the hunger for power \u00a0could torpedo the project. There is always a danger that the idea is not accepted, that the needs of the stakeholders are not met or met only partially; that there are \"too many cooks\" or that the concept can not be implemented due to conflicting priorities, or dependencies between partners and networks arise.\nYet we see possibilities to work against these risks. Reality has proven that it already works, and many people are working toward this aim worldwide:\nWe are many! We cooperate and we are a network. We have sufficient human capacity. Our approach is flexible and can be used in existing structures and institutions. Dependence on existing systems and infrastructures can be solved via an \"open-source\" approach that leads to a multiplying effect, where copying is allowed and actively encouraged.\nThis leads to the reduction of fears, relaxation, deceleration, satisfaction and happiness. There will be systemic relief or elimination of the superfluous, as well as personal and societal development potential through inclusion and the integration of \"fringe groups\" such as unemployed, refugees or marginalized citizens.\nFor evaluation it is intended to study these criteria and assumptions in order to confirm them: Self-organization in groups works. Positions, attitudes and values are part of a common vision. Skills are included and allocated according to an open source principle. The new system or the new platform reaches more people and connects more participants than previous systems or platforms. There are spaces where encounters already take place. Spaces can be created where encounters are possible. Spaces that meet various needs lead to added value for all.\nInterestingly, it can be stated that all three working groups arrived at very similar approaches and ideas, problems and solutions during this intense, exciting and inspiring eight hour workshop: A change of perspective and a paradigm shift is required - instead of focusing on fighting disease, working towards the promotion of health!\nCaroline Paulick-Thiel & Jahn Harrison, nextlearning e.V.\nTranslation: Alexander Paulick-Thiel", "created_at": "2017-05-22 18:19:14", "updated_at": "2017-05-22 18:19:14", "tag_id": 1257, "post_id": 542, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 509}, {"id": 9156, "text": null, "quote": "Sara: \u201cThere is much work to do including working with actual users and receiving their feedback.

Looks as though co-creating is the road where the community is defining the destination, planning the journey and sharing the drive. \u00a0Let\u2019s hear from Irene\u201d\n\u201cI can never thank the Reggio Emilia blind people union enough for accepting me in their community and interacting with me so sincerely and proactively. Let me say that 2 years ago I started spending some time with them, to enquire about their daily challenges, and to shadow some of them (who kindly volunteered) during their daily routines, I had conceived this as any other didactic activity of my university education, excitingly on the field, but not more special\u2026 how wrong could I have been!\nLong story short, I had reached out as part of a design thinking exercise, after brainstorming with my colleagues over social and technical literature to find solutions to the challenge of blind people navigation through living environments, \u201csimply\u201d to extract narratives about what we thought their problem to be and, thus, tune our solutions\u2026 We had succeeded obtaining the information we wanted, we had lists of the defeating features of currently existing solutions, descriptions of use cases, but while working on the desired features, something started to emerge for some of us in the team: another narrative had been seeping through our conversations with the blind volunteers, that we did not consider in advance. Most of the blind people we had talked to, despite agreeing to the obstacles imposed by visual impairment, did not consider that a defining condition and were rather cold to any assistive technology they tested or we described. Instead, narratives of empowerment, education, disintermediation, were flowing through most of their replies, even when our conversations were explicitly biased towards solutions\u201d.\nLet this sink for a moment. And remember that the number one challenge of helping another person is falling in love with the solution one wants to offer, losing sight of the\u00a0person\u00a0in exchange for the\u00a0problem.\nSo we asked Irene to recollect her most significant conversation for us:\nIL (Irene Lanza): \u201cGood morning Maria[\u00a0I would like to thank you already for your time\u2026 it is truly precious to me to be able to talk with you\u201d\nMBC (Mother of an 11years old blind child): \u201cGood morning Irene. I have heard about you from my friends and fellows from the blind union\u2026 they say you are a very polite and smart girl\u201d\nIL: \u201cAww\u2026 how much will they ask me to pay, now? \u2026haha\u201d\nMBC: \u201chaha\u201d\nIL: \u201cDid they also already tell you about what I would like to talk today?\u201d\nMBC: \u201cvaguely\u2026 apparently, you are working on a new technology to assist blind people in their daily life\u2026?\u201d\nIL: \u201cThat is fairly accurate, but luckily they did not spoil our fun by letting you in too many details. In facts, we are working at the proof-of-concept of a wearable device that could analyze the surroundings in real time and feed information about objects, their velocities, and positions to a visually impaired user, to allow him/her moving naturally through a living environment\u2026 our challenge is to allow a blind person to play a football game competitively against people with normal vision\u2026 well, we would still not provide talent though\u201d\nMBC: \u201cSo, are you thinking of something like those apps on the smartphones?\u201d\nIL: \u201cWell, not really\u2026 we would have dedicated hardware, and we would like to collect your opinions about how to design the user interface\u2026 a smartphone app would be a proof-of-concept compared to the kind of product design we are pursuing\u201d\nMBC: \u201cI don\u2019t like this kind of assistive technology much\u2026 you never know it will let you down. So many factors: the signal may be lost, the battery may go down, the app could crash\u2026 what should I do then?\u201d\nIL: \u201cThis is exactly what I am here to listen to\u2026 you see, we will collect all these opinions, and try to prioritize features in our design concept\u2026 so, have you already tried some of those?\u201d\nMBC: \u201cI am constantly exploring and searching for new tricks and tools that could help Mario, so I often talk about this topic with my friends at the union, and I try some them after reading their reviews or hearing their presentations. Most of them are quite far away from real life, for they are very specialized on single use cases, and they rely on infrastructural investments that in our Country are stagnating for too long already. Mario\u2019s problems extend well beyond walking through an airport or a shopping mall or reading the label on a tomato can. The only tool I really find useful is the reader with vocal synthesis on the smartphone: it works pretty well and it\u2019s so precious to be able to listen to any book when audiobooks are still not the norm\u2026\u201d\nIL: \u201cSo could you tell me more about Mario\u2019s experience? What do you think are the most commonplace barriers he experiences when going to school? How does he roam around?\u201d\nMBC: \u201cHe is training with the stick. Many people dislike it, but it is rather dependable and attracts sufficient attention to ensure that other people will be more cooperative and safely behaved. However everyday life can become very problematic. Architectures are often hiding traps that would surprise for the naivety of those who designed the spaces: you would never imagine the feeling of dread when you have just seen your son missing an unprotected element from a window, protruding out of a wall with its sharp corners\u2026 and the use of the spaces themselves can be even more challenging! Hanging wires, doors opening directly on stairs, elements built in non-shock-resistant glass. Many of these, if you ask me, would be dangerous to any child, but if you factor in the inability to forecast what you are going to meet next\u2026 The risk of bad practices escalates quickly!\u201d\nIL: \u201cSo school is not a safe haven for Mario\u2026?\u201d\nMBC: \u201cNot just that\u2026 most activities are not structured to include children like Mario. Schoolbooks are more difficult to find as eBooks for the vocal synthesizer than others. Even then, many graphics, whether didactic or there for testing purposes, remain inaccessible\u2026 and even the teachers, despite being adorable with Mario, are not informed about methods for inclusive teaching\u2026 For example, my husband is a musician, and he has always tried to exploit musical theory to organize our family games (she mocks for me a couple of games based on recognizing the tones, or what an object at home could be based on analogies of noises). We constantly try to use acoustics as a tool to explain concepts, and risks to our child\u2026\u201d\nIL: \u201c\u2026and this, of course, doesn\u2019t happen at school\u201d\nMBC: \u201cNot even closely. School sometimes becomes a very frustrating experience\u2026 a place of isolation to remind Mario of his diversity. Irene, you are young, you must remember your lectures of geometry, for example\u2026\u201d\nIL: \u201cyes, indeed\u2026 mostly graphics are drawn on the blackboard\u2026 I see what you mean\u201d\nMBC: \u201ceven our language is geared for the idea that\u00a0seeing is believing. Mario often tells me that he has seen a schoolmate with a certain outfit or some event that he is going to tell me about\u2026 he does enormously to find his place in society. And my husband and I do our maximum to help him surpass the social barriers: we teach him games that he can play with his friends, we accompany him to familiarize with the places where he will have to interact with his mates, and we drill into him, constantly, how to react to the unexpected, hoping that panic will never prevail. Technology, instead of these half-baked attempts at substituting vision for simple tasks, should take on education\u2026 there is so much more that is lost in our societies when one cannot see than just reading on a can whether it is tomato or green peas, and nurturing those skills that we all have as fellow humans, rather than focusing on what we lack, would be so much more empowering.\u201d\nIL: \u201cwhat you say is very inspirational\u2026 so you believe education is the true mean of supporting Mario\u2026 and what is the place of technology in your vision?\u201d\nMBC: \u201cwe live in a time obsessed with technology, and we forget that it is just a tool. I have not hidden from you, I am not a big supporter of the idea. For example, we use the e-reader with voice synthesizer\u2026 the problem is extremely important, but not mission critical, and so the technical solution makes sense\u2026 I am not sure I would delegate to technology, or to other humans for what is worth it, many other things on a regular base\u2026 what would be the meaning of life, if you give up on the very experiences that make it worth sharing and living? We are social animals, someone more important than me said once\u2026\u201d\nIL: \u201cMaria, thank you really for letting me peer into your family life\u2026 and thank you for your kind guidance. I hope that we will be able to live to your expectations, but I can already promise you that we will at least try our best!\u201d\nMBC: \u201cIt has been my pleasure Irene, it is so nice to meet a young person trying with enthusiasm to tackle a problem we have to deal and cope with every day. I wish you the best of luck, and I look forward to hearing about your progress!\u201d\nWhen Irene went back to the team after this conversation, she was confused, for having just experienced the most confrontational conversation about their project. Irene was moved emotionally by the passion and interest expressed by the mother. An experience that would leave her forever changed and stretched.\nWith Irene insisting, a small group of three people from the original team started diverging from the original path of designing a wearable \u201csmall world\u201d navigation system. They started brainstorming wildly about educational concepts.\nIndependently from the rest of the team, which opposed the need to bring to completion the academic assignment, they sought a new agreement with their mentor and started optimal\u00a0thinking at 360\u00ba. Using 3D ultrasound-based haptic interfaces to offer interactive geometry education or simulators for practical tasks that would completely substitute visualization for acoustic and tactile feedbacks? Most of the early ideas were dropped when their mentor, or people not involved in the team that he suggested to talk to, would object other low-tech solutions (e.g.: wooden models for 3D geometry) could deliver almost the same experience, significantly undercutting the complexities of the projects.\nIt was during this na\u00efve and intense search, that their mentor showed them a video of a blind person using tongue clicks to echolocate while biking (!!!).

A collision of honest and upfront conversations about existential experiences and a research of numerous solutions that had yet to be exploited in a certain context, rethinking their business models.\nAt this point, SoundSight was a completely new initiative. A virtual gym to train echolocation, and while the idea of features and UX design accumulated quickly, the team pursued a proof-of-concept and something that others could think of as a minimum viable product.\nThe first prototype was a mess. To the users invited to a test, it must have seemed unbelievable how a software engineer could have thought that a piece of software reverberating in a fixed environment and artificial sound would have been enough to suggest how the platform would work. Not to mention, a command line interface, and a rather lengthy procedure to change the position within the simulated environment. But thanks to the outgoing and always positive outlook of Irene, they never thought of disinvesting: SoundSight was an experience for them.\nThe team worked hectically on Irene\u2019s feedbacks, and a really workable proof-of-concept finally became available around Spring 2015.\n\u00a0\nLet\u2019s leave it again to Irene\u2019s recollection:\nIrene: \u201cHello Mario[1], we are here again\u2026 this time I promise you will be impressed\u201d\nMario: \u201cHi Irene, it\u2019s a pleasure\u2026 and rest assured, last time I was already impressed, although maybe not as you hoped for\u2026 with my friends we have been laughing a lot about your engineer\u2019s idea of a prototype!\u201d\nIrene: \u201cOh no, Mario\u2026 don\u2019t abuse him, or who knows when we will find another person with the same talent and will to do something meaningful even with no immediate profit in sight! I am counting on you to keep certain things\u201d\nMario: \u201cDon\u2019t worry Irene, I have only told the story to one or two\u2026 hundreds of people\u2026 ahahah!\u201d\nIrene: \u201cDoh! \u2026ok Mario, then to pay you back, today\u2019s text will be extra tough!\u201d\nMario: \u201cI am ready for the challenge!\u201d\n\u00a0\nIrene sets up the simulation\n\u00a0\nIrene: \u201cOK Mario, it\u2019s ready. I would like to ask you to try the first round without me sharing with you any information\u2026 I want you to focus on your impressions only, tell me how it feels\u201d\nMario: \u201clet\u2019s start\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe simulation is run, Mario is moved to several places in a cathedral in this virtual world, and listens to the echoes of a tongue click\n\u00a0\nMario: \u201cIndeed there have been a lot of improvements, it is smooth now\u2026 last time it was a bit of an annoyance to have to wait for so long every time you wanted to move the position. However, listening to a prerecorded tongue click\u2026 are you sure these are simulations?\u201d\nIrene: \u201cYes Mario\u2026 we know it still requires a bit of imagination, but I assure you this is a real time simulation. Later during the tests, I will offer you the possibility to move the position arbitrarily, and you should notice it. It is definitely on our list of priorities to introduce real-time input of user generated tongue clicks\u2026 we are just not there yet\u2026 you are one of our very early testers, and I cannot thank you enough for that\u201d\nMario: \u201cDon\u2019t, I enjoy this experience, and I really like the concept. Somehow contributing to its realization makes me proud. However, you need my honest opinions, and I think the ability to exploit the user\u2019s own tongue click will improve the experience terrifically. I have realized that you have made me move through wide and small environments\u2026 but I haven\u2019t been able to identify where I was.\u201d\nIrene: \u201cThat\u2019s already quite good Mario! I have only given you one point for each environment, and you have already been able to tell something about them\u2026 you are the best! We will focus on learning curves and performances later again, can you tell me anything else about your general impressions at the moment?\u201d\nMario: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to tell you more from just this\u2026 maybe we can move to the next exercise?\u201d\nIrene: \u201cYes, here we go. Get ready, and now I will let you walk through the environment of today, and you will hear repeated clicks\u2026 try to guess what it would be\u201d\nJust a quick run of the new scenario on the simulator\nMario: \u201chmmm\u2026 the smoothness has improved a lot\u2026 but I really could not tell you what it is. It seems a large environment, I have been getting away from a wall and after getting closer to another?\u201d\nIrene: \u201cI had told you would not have an easy life, after those jokes about our engineer Mario! But you did quite well. It was a cathedral\u2026 now that I have told you, could you confirm it or would you still be doubtful?\u201d\nMario: \u201cLet me try to listen again\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u2026the simulator runs again shortly\nMario: \u201cYes Irene, now that I know, it could well be\u2026 I had some doubts, with no context it could have been a theater or a large gym, \u2026\u201d\nIrene: \u201cIndeed\u2026 now I would like you to do a few exercises\u2026 I will tell you this time what you are going to listen to, precisely, and you will have to focus on the features\u2026 later there will be a test\u2026\u201d\nMario: \u201cFor me or for the software?\u201d\nIrene: \u201cFor both, Mario, don\u2019t try to escape your responsibilities\u201d\nMario: \u201cAhahah\u201d\n\u00a0\nThey run the training set\nMario: \u201cWell Irene, we will see how I perform later\u2026 but you should consider developing an interface to feed information about structures, volumes, and positions, directly to your users\u2026 it is nice to chat with you, but if you really think of this as a tool for making echolocation training accessible to anyone, the fact that you need to have by your side another person as your interface to the system doesn\u2019t add up\u201d\nIrene: \u201cYou are right. Together with the real-time acquisition of users\u2019 clicks, this interface is at the top of our list of priorities. We are thinking of using a simple tablet of mechanically executed needles to offer a map of the space being tested and a natural interface\u2026 or some haptic 3D interface, but that may be more expensive and complicated. We have not yet looked into that enough\u201d\nMario: \u201cYou would need a lot of needles to offer a useful interface\u2026 you can try prototyping something quick maybe with Arduino\u2026 but I would be a lot more curious about the haptic interface. I have seen some applications with holograms and they looked impressive.\u201d\nIrene: \u201cWe will keep this in mind. Of course, we need to make it as simple and cheap as possible, but still functional\u2026 and we hope the prices of that hardware will be democratized soon. Now that we have taken a small break\u2026\u201d\nMario: \u201cWhat break? Are you not letting me off yet?\u201d\nIrene: \u201cMario, let\u2019s just take the test before the coffee\u2026 I will let you off then, for today\u201d\nMario: \u201cOk, ok\u2026 a no is not possible anyway, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nIrene: \u201cIt\u2019s always possible, but I will insist with a smile\u201d\nThey run the tests\nIrene: \u201dif we compare today\u2019s performances to those from the last tests, both with the software and in the lab with the moving panels, you have really gotten better Mario!\u201d\nMario: \u201cBut Irene, how can I be sure if I have truly learned? I mean\u2026 we should arrange tests where there are coupled with some sort of benchmark\u2026 maybe similar tests in real world, you could imagine a mobile lab to do so\u2026 or even just arrange competitions among users\u201d\nIrene: \u201cThat\u2019s a really good idea, Mario! We will seriously reflect on how to arrange this, but for the time being\u2026 do you think your partner would like to try it out against you?\u201d\nMario: \u201cBut she sees\u2026\u201d\nIrene: \u201cit should not be an advantage, and I promise you I will not show her the screen\u201d\nThis is now a different story\u2026 but after being initially baffled, Mario\u2019s partner took it to her heart to seriously compete with him, and in the end, she won one of the tests, confirming anyone can learn this skill.\n1\u00a0Please be reminded that Mario is a blind guy.

I'm not suggesting open source is more reliable, or the only way to go with medical devices. However, there is an issue of transparency of the code to the patient, that has 'similar' issues to the issues of open source.\nOn your other points though, you rightly note that there is a lot of safety and regulation around medical devices. However, we still know that user input issues pervade the safety of medical devices. For examples, see the paper Preventing Medication Errors by \u00a0P Aspden, J Wolcott, J L Bootman, L R Cronenwett:, or any of a number of papers by Harold Thimbleby. The paper Killed by Code written by Sandler et al, also details many case studies that you might be interested in. Getting back to the point about safety regulation, I don't believe that safety regulation takes security into account as regularly. This istarting to happen, but very slowly. This is why the paper \"Pacemakers and implantable cardiac defibrillators: Software radio attacks and zero-power defenses\" is so powerful. They took an FDA certified device, and showed it was possible to make it operate unsafely after some security analysis.\nThere are many more things we might discuss about regulation, such as the FDA's limited resources for looking at the code of the devices. However, there are some good things too, such as the MAUDE database. http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfMAUDE/search.CFM\nBy making this database available, we can search for adverse events and study this in an evidence based approach, as you rightly request.

I have a rich medical history and although I had a brief run in with acupuncture, I never really went for it. I'd still like try it out\u00a0when the opportunity presents itself.\nIt's an interesting remark on the authority of health practitioners @steelweaver and @Noemi . I think the reliance on\u00a0guidance by an expert\u00a0is in large part\u00a0the result of the patients\u00a0not being as familiar with acupuncture\u00a0as the expert. Yet patients\u00a0are there for a reason: at some level, they believe in\u00a0the positive potential of the treatment. This common\u00a0belief of both parties is the base for authority and\u00a0lends you, or the practitioner, as an expert the authority to give direction. Authority governs the interaction and when nobody (or nothing) assumes it, confusion arises. To be clear:\u00a0authority is different from power.\nI can complement this with my personal experience in the standard healthcare system in Belgium. For a little over 5 years I had a series of serious physical afflictions, which didn't ever seem to heal or resolve themselves and only got worse over the years. At the start I always\u00a0left the clinic with a smile, which\u00a0always disappeared in days, weeks or months as the situation deteriorated again. I experienced first hand that I was just\u00a0a number, and that treating symptoms is faster and\u00a0easier. Good thing for pharma companies, because endlessly treating symptoms sells more drugs.\u00a0Finding the real cause takes longer, is harder and is more expensive, at least in the short term.\nI got pretty skeptical about the system by going from doctor to doctor and spending more time in physiotherapy than with my friends or family. Gradually I lost belief in the system. It was\u00a0after I ultimately found the cause and cure (very simple ones at that) that whatever remained\u00a0of my belief vanished.\u00a0With that\u00a0gone, there was no more common belief between me and the doctor, so the authority vanished. My language can't hide\u00a0it: I found the\u00a0solution, not a doctor or a system.\u00a0For this specific\u00a0illness, I will not lend authority very easily anymore either.\u00a0I'm lucky, as I have a general idea of healthcare through my studies\u00a0and know my body well by now, but this is clearly problematic for the general population when you hear similar stories with unhappy endings.\nAlso interesting that (at least for me) a big part of the authority of the health practitioner is due to belief in the system, rather than a belief in the knowledge of the doctor (which I never really doubted).\u00a0I think that might be a western thing, linked to what\u00a0surfaced in the discussions with @alkasem23 about differences in care with Syria:\u00a0in the west we put our trust in and rely on systems rather than other people. In some\u00a0other cultures,\u00a0people probably put their belief mainly in a person, the doctor.\nEasier interactions through\u00a0the internet,\u00a0powerful search engines,\u00a0a lot of people sharing experience and stories online, easy access to second opinions (in my country anyway)... Though they don't\u00a0always provide\u00a0correct information, these factors also\u00a0lead people to challenge the authority in terms of knowledge\u00a0of the practitioner in the classical doctor's office. I\u00a0think both this challenging of knowledge and the failure of the system will inevitably lead to some fundamental changes in healthcare.\nImportantly, authority cannot simply disappear, the common belief has to shift to something else. Most stories of\u00a0experimentation with new methods in the stories here on Edgeryders\u00a0share some sort of\u00a0community aspect. This\u00a0illustrates a shift to lending authority to a\u00a0collective rather than a system or a person. The\u00a0collective can consist\u00a0of patients, doctors or other caregivers and is likely\u00a0a mixture ideally. In Syria the collective is mainly the family, according to Alkasem.\nLooking through this lens\u00a0of authority\u00a0is interesting and can be applied to many aspects of our\u00a0daily lives.\u00a0The matter is fresh in my head from a Dutch book I just finished reading, which I hope\u00a0gets translated\u00a0to English.

The main differentiator wrt such scenarios would/could (mainly) be the user-interface.\nIn the simplest\u00a0case, the device could be programmed (by a physician, physiotherapist etc.) in order to mimic/repeat a predefined set of motions over and over again in order, for example, to avoid the undesired consequences of limbs immobilization (contractures, poor blood circulation etc).\nIn a rehab setting, for example post-stroke, the exoskeleton's motions could be derived by decoding user's intention via physiological signals (mainly EEG, EMG). In this case the basic idea would be to allow the user to complement or slowly re-gain control over his flaccid/weak arm and discontinue its use once the user does not need it any longer.\nIn an assistive setting, for example post spinal cord injury or in myopathies, the exoskeleton's motions could be derived as before or chosen from a simple interface (e.g. smartphone, joysticks etc.) in order to provide assistance-as-needed, whenever the user wears\u00a0the device.\nIn a case like the one you've mentioned the device could indeed be used, not to help but rather to (selectively) resist the movements. By customizing some parameters to the user's needs/residual abilities, one could enable\u00a0specific trainings in order to work on specific ranges of motions, torques, joints/muscles combinations etc. Such parameters/programs could be also updated by a physician, or dynamically (by the device itself) by inferring correlates of muscle-fatigue, achievable range of motions etc.\nIn all the previous scenarios, as specified by @Noemi, data related to the user's progress could be collected and analyzed, for the sake of monitoring and improving the therapy itself.", "created_at": "2017-01-22 18:56:01", "updated_at": "2017-01-22 18:56:01", "tag_id": 1302, "post_id": 13646, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 773}, {"id": 9385, "text": null, "quote": "The last two weeks we made some research at the Refugee Camp at ICC Messe Berlin. The very nice volunteer Berivan showed us around and we had the chance to talk directly with the people.\nThe first time we visited I was surprised how \u201egood\u201c the atmosphere was. I somehow always thought a refugee camp would be a very sad place, but children were running around playing and everyone was kind of open and nice to each other (from my point of view).\u00a0\nThe ICC Messe is a former congress centrum which was recently rebuilt\u00a0to be a refugee camp. The Big Main Hall is segmented with thin white walls into something like 40 rooms that look like roofless boxes. Instead of doors there are blankets and towels covering the entrances. There are no windows; in this main Hall the light comes from tubes in the ceiling.\u00a0Inside of each room there are 4 bunk beds, so in total 8 people per room\u00a0(familys are usually separated and live in private rooms, also: the rooms are separated by gender).\nUsually the rooms don't have any kind of furniture inside, but the one we were sitting in had a big picnic table and a bench and also a bunch of office chairs. We got offered very sweet black Tea in plastic cups and started sharing stories.\u00a0\nFirstly we asked how people organize themselves in the room.\nThe Camp is designed for people to stay around three months, but most of the people are staying six or more. There are only the bare necessities provided. For example there are no possibilities to unpack the backpacks or suitcases, which are probably unpacked since the beginning of the journey. Thats why the people find solutions, for example they pull out nails from the wall and hang their cloth on these nails. Or they found a piece of metal string which they also used to hang cloth from. There are also some card boxes used as bed table and chest. Hussam (who is diligently learning German) pointed at one of the card boxes saying \u201eK\u00fchlschrank\u201c. We were laughing but it was true! tomatoes, cans of beans and a lot of eggs were stored\u00a0there. Also under the bed was a lot of food (maybe the darkest and coldest spot in the room). The reason for that is that they don't always like food by the caterer and of course you get hungry between the official \u201emeals\u201c. They boil the eggs in a water cooker by the way!\u00a0\nAnother interesting observation was a little plastic cup full of washing powder.(they usually give the dirty cloth away to the washing and get them back clean) Hussam told us that he likes his shirts to be without creases and because there is no way to iron,he washes them with his hands and drys them in the room. That was eye opening for me because, yes they might have nothing but they have dignity and preferences! they start a living.\nAlso very interesting is that in the bunk beds the bottom bed is the preferred bed because they can build a little privacy by hanging towels and sheets at the upper bed. The upper bed is always dependent on the main light system which is switched off at 11 in the night.\nBerivan told us that in one room they build constructions out of a broken bunk bed so that also the upper bed could shield from the light.\nAnother very striking construction was a piece of wood sticked to the wall with duct tape which was supposed to be a smartphone shelf, to watch movies at night.\nAlso they put pictures from magazines on the wall to make the atmosphere a little more cosy.\nBut still even if they find the possibility to hack something there is a lot of stuff just flying around in the room.\nThere was a lot of creativity to make the most out of the given, bit still no tools or materials. Berivan told us they used to give out tools, but because they never came back so there are no tools anymore.\u00a0What if we could support the already existing creativity by opening a space for tools and materials? encouraging them with their ideas and hacks?", "created_at": "2017-01-22 22:05:02", "updated_at": "2017-01-22 22:05:02", "tag_id": 1302, "post_id": 681, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 648}, {"id": 9386, "text": null, "quote": "our scenarios included:\n(1) no change;\n(2) distancing or 'out-sourcing' of risk-taking to facilitate innovation using public monies (e.g. through endowments to organisations like NESTA \u2013 which, we felt, could themselves work better in relation to risk);\n(3) social collaboration or in\u2013sourcing of risk to facilitate innovation (e.g. developing platforms to work across sectors as per Spot the Future); and\n(4) sharing risk through increased transparency for accountability and cloud funding for finance (I.E. the state says we want to spend x% of tax payers funding on R&D but will only spend that on things that citizens match-fund \u2013 so, crowd-source inputs to risk-taking where it involves public monies); and\n(5) state turns risk-taker and develops R&D departments in-house unashamedly \u2013 as per: http://www.techrepublic.com/article/ibm-research-report-endorses-government-innovation-offices-with-caveats/", "created_at": "2015-02-18 19:29:00", "updated_at": "2015-02-18 19:29:00", "tag_id": 1303, "post_id": 3891, "creator_id": 1974, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 3858}, {"id": 9387, "text": null, "quote": "Low-cost pharmaceutical products: medicines, prosthetics, etc. (Include water filters, compost toilets, hand washing in case there\u2019s a general break-down and not just health-care is affected?)", "created_at": "2016-07-24 12:59:59", "updated_at": "2016-07-24 12:59:59", "tag_id": 1304, "post_id": 1648, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 1615}, {"id": 9388, "text": null, "quote": "I guess it depends.

What were your motivations?\nThe Hubotics project started in late 2013. At that point I was about to finish my Master\u2019s studies and I wanted to add a practical side to my technical skills as an engineer and as a passionate DIYer by developing accessible technologies and aids which could have helped improving independence for people suffering from motor disabilities. Actually, the reason why I decided to study engineering and became a builder and hacker stemmed from my personal experience with my sister Chiara, who suffers from a motor disability.\nI remember, as a child, my parents used to buy plenty of super expensive devices, as computer headsets, mice, keyboards or having to travel back and forth between clinics and private medical studios to have access to the \u201clatest\u201d rehabilitation techniques. After having hacked wheelchairs, remote controls for doors and televisions inside our house and having realized several other robotic contraptions, I realized that achievement of independence through the use of one\u2019s own body is one of the most gratifying experiences everyone could hope for, that\u2019s how the idea of creating an exoskeleton to be used in everyday\u2019s life was born.\n2. Did you start alone? How long did it take to develop the initial prototype? How was it funded?\nAround that time, I started speaking about these ideas with Roberto, a friend with whom I had studied between Torino and Milano. Together, we started brainstorming and discussing and we finally converged on the idea of developing a low-cost, 3D printed exoskeleton for rehabilitation and assistance of upper-limbs, directly at people\u2019s homes.\nThe idea was proposed at the Telecom Italia WCAP accelerator in Catania that believed in the project and decided to fund us. This allowed us to buy the 3D printers and the components to build and iterate on our ideas and prototypes. The first reliable prototype of the device, finalized in one year, consisted of a wearable, smartphone-controlled, elbow exoskeleton.\nAfter showing the device at the MakerFaire 2015 in Rome and gathering plenty of positive feedback, we understood that the project had plenty of potential and decided to keep working on it.\nWhat is your current status now?\nToday, together with Roberto and Chiara, we keep on improving our devices and iterate on the designs in order to achieve a concept as usable and useful as possible while maximizing customizability and accessibility. Our latest device consists of an exoskeleton with 3 active degrees of freedom for controlling the shoulder abduction/adduction, shoulder flexion/extension and elbow flexion/extension of its wearer.\nThe device can be controlled by means of a smartphone app or by a program with predefined motions/tasks.\n5. How do you see it moving forward? What kind of help/expertise/data that is missing for moving to a next phase?\nOur main objective in the near future is running experiments with potential users of the exoskeleton and their relatives, in order to gather further feedback and improve our devices based on this.\n\u00a0Additionally, we are brainstorming on possible models that would allow the project to keep its philosophy of openness and accessibility while making it economically sustainable. For example, how to fund the project in order to promote further development? How to enable open/low-cost and customizable solutions capable of reaching end-users? How to ensure that these devices would work (and keep working) at users\u2019 houses (services?), all these are open questions that we will be working on for the next phase.", "created_at": "2017-01-10 17:26:20", "updated_at": "2017-01-10 17:26:20", "tag_id": 1307, "post_id": 806, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 773}, {"id": 9397, "text": null, "quote": "Very interesting.

The main idea behind its development is that of enabling its use directly at people's homes, in order to allow intensive sessions directly in activities of daily living.\u00a0As such, it could be used in several scenarios, from rehab to assistance. The main differentiator wrt such scenarios would/could (mainly) be the user-interface.\nIn the simplest\u00a0case, the device could be programmed (by a physician, physiotherapist etc.) in order to mimic/repeat a predefined set of motions over and over again in order, for example, to avoid the undesired consequences of limbs immobilization (contractures, poor blood circulation etc).\nIn a rehab setting, for example post-stroke, the exoskeleton's motions could be derived by decoding user's intention via physiological signals (mainly EEG, EMG). In this case the basic idea would be to allow the user to complement or slowly re-gain control over his flaccid/weak arm and discontinue its use once the user does not need it any longer.\nIn an assistive setting, for example post spinal cord injury or in myopathies, the exoskeleton's motions could be derived as before or chosen from a simple interface (e.g. smartphone, joysticks etc.) in order to provide assistance-as-needed, whenever the user wears\u00a0the device.\nIn a case like the one you've mentioned the device could indeed be used, not to help but rather to (selectively) resist the movements. By customizing some parameters to the user's needs/residual abilities, one could enable\u00a0specific trainings in order to work on specific ranges of motions, torques, joints/muscles combinations etc. Such parameters/programs could be also updated by a physician, or dynamically (by the device itself) by inferring correlates of muscle-fatigue, achievable range of motions etc.\nIn all the previous scenarios, as specified by @Noemi, data related to the user's progress could be collected and analyzed, for the sake of monitoring and improving the therapy itself.", "created_at": "2017-01-22 18:55:43", "updated_at": "2017-01-22 18:55:43", "tag_id": 1307, "post_id": 13646, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 773}, {"id": 9399, "text": null, "quote": "Hubotics was presented at the OpenCare Deep Games event at CERN earlier this year.

It can be used in various areas for example the evaluation of dexterity, sport, music & gaming.\nOur beneficiaries are all those people who needs to have an experience feedback concerning the hand movements.\nreHub glove is a tool designed for proprioceptive rehabilitation, to recover movement fluidity after an injury: provided by the physiotherapist, it allows the patient to record and report exercises data such as hand position, finger flexion and fingertips pressure. Recorded data are displayed through a software that reproduces a 3D hand, its movements and detected values. Through the software a physiotherapist is able to evaluate the therapeutic process and possibly change it. Thanks to reHub exercises can be done in physiotherapist presence or at a distance.\nReHub acquires informations about fingers movements from flex and pressure sensors. It uses a 6DOF sensor to define the position of the hand in space.\nreHub glove is the result of a meeting between electronics enthusiasts, a physical therapist and a hand rehabilitation patient to find a way to solve the problem of monitoring the progress during rehabilitation therapy. During this meeting we found out there are no digital devices to monitor the hand rehabilitation and we decided to develop one.\u00a0\nTo define our project we didn\u2019t started from a theoretical concept. We started to make the prototype and to test it.\u00a0\nThe development of reHub working prototype has been at the heart of our design process.\nAs described on www.rehub.pro, the definition of the prototype is subdivided into 4 time frames of research and development. The first steps of the team have moved in electronics and design.\nAfter testing the very first glove we decided to create an integrated system with a self-produced/maker pcb. Our design has always been oriented, and always will be, to integrate all electronics on the top of the glove. Another aspect of our prototype is that the glove itself must be comfortable for the patient. At a later time, once we knew that the glove was able to transmit data to the computer, we focused on the development of a software allowing patients and physiotherapists to evaluate the glove\u2019s collected data through a graphical interface and cartesian charts.\nWe are looking for our final user(s), who will try our product and help us develop different options:\n\nSport\nGaming\nEducational\nMedical \u00a0\n\nWe want to built a community and start a business strategy.\nWe will publish tutorials, kits and software to make your glove.\nEverything to improve the glove solution.\nWe want to develop 4 different kits to sell:\n\nwith single sensors\u00a0\nonly the electronics\nglove tailored\ncomplete of all\n components\n\nWebsites & Social\nwww.rehub.pro\nwww.facebook.com/rehubglove", "created_at": "2017-05-22 19:11:29", "updated_at": "2017-05-22 19:11:29", "tag_id": 1307, "post_id": 33751, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 6600}, {"id": 9401, "text": null, "quote": "I am personally a fan of \"analog\" location based.", "created_at": "2016-07-23 08:46:17", "updated_at": "2016-07-23 08:46:17", "tag_id": 1308, "post_id": 25991, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 5729}, {"id": 9403, "text": null, "quote": "What about shelters for homeless?

This extends from food and clothing to socializing in the clubroom of the Centre. It is also open to local and foreign collectivities, such as theatrical groups or other alternative schemes that can\u2019t afford much money to rent a place in order to operate. And is accessed by both Greeks and immigrants (especially children) who lack educational opportunities.\nIt was established in 2004 on the initiative of Antiracist Initiative of Thessaloniki and since 2009 it is housed in a historic area of the city center. Beyond the Antiracist Initiative, its 3 floors currently house approximately 20 movements, labor, migration and social collectives, assemblies and other initiatives, like theatrical and cultural groups.\nInitiatives of the Migrants Social Centre also include voluntary actions of practical solidarity groups such as \u201cOut of the Classroom\u201d that offers free courses in Greeks and immigrants (Greek and foreign language lessons, additional teaching to Junior High School and High School students). It also runs:\n\n\na Solidarity Kitchen that offers meal and companionship to hundreds of people every weekend.\n \n\nRoom39 that gathers and distributes relief items and food to refugees and homeless.\n \n\nA Legal Support Group for refugees and immigrants and many other temporary or permanent activities.\n \n\nOther collectivities that reside independently in the Migrants Social Centre are Indigenous People of Biafra, the Network for Unemployed and Precarious Workers, the Network for Political and Social Rights, Ethical, Technological & Idealistic Association the Theatrical and Tango Group of Immigrants\u2019 Place, and much more.\nWe are reaching out to citizens and other local organizations through a dedicated website and our Facebook page, which includes all information that needs to be transferred to people in need.

A country like Bangladesh, which is constantly facing threats of so many kinds of natural disaster, is being increasingly ignorant about its natural conservation. This country has only 17% of forests within. This by the way is getting narrower. Even the largest mangrove forest Sundarbans, which is an internationally recognized world heritage site, is also facing terrible manmade disasters and constant environmental pollutions. It has reached such a zenith, that the global-ecosystem is threatened with the loss of a majority of all species, by the end of this century. Everyone knows, but some chose to ignore it, some choose to remain silent about it. But I thought the simplest solution to address this problem is just plant more trees. It\u2019s a simple yet most productive solution to involve the youth, who first of all should be concerned about it; secondly should take initiatives to mitigate this problem. The idea to run an online campaign came to me due to the massive participation of youth in social media. My goals were very simple, engaging the youth to talk about the problem or at least make them realize how important it is to address the issue. Secondly, mobilize my community to take an initiative in real space so that they feel the necessity to do something about this particular problem.\nAlong with few friends, I started inviting people over facebook to join the event. All they had to do is plant 5 trees and nominate 5 other friends on facebook to replicate the same. This way it will work like a chain reaction and we will be able to see a huge number of trees getting planted in a short period of time. The campaign is still going on and more people are joining. I know it has not gone viral and the number is not that high. Because in reality if you want to mobilize your community for a good cause, you have to ensure some motivations for them. Social norms are something that people tend to follow. Online campaign is there to help create a buzz, to create an objective. Which means if someone can bring out the movement from online space to offline, it moves faster and better. This is exactly why I have planned to run this campaign both online and offline.\nPrimarily I even offered few things extra to carry on with the campaign. Since I am an online based entrepreneur and I have a client tale which is 3 years old, we kind of have a personal trust relationship with each \u00a0other. So I personally offered my clients, I'll plant trees on behalf of them for every sell worth $10.\nTo bring the campaign to reality, a part of that plan involves talking to the civil society and involving them. Therefore, we are in touch with mayor\u2019s office to propose an idea to tell the citizens, if they plants 5 trees, they'll get a discount on their TAX. The CEO\u2019s of top notch companies to take part in this initiative where we want them to initiate a tree plantation program as a part of their CSR activities. Encourage their employees to plant trees so that they can get a better record at the end of the year in the ACR. We've asked the Headmasters of local schools to run the campaign along with the students, whoever plants more trees and takes care of them properly, will get an excellence award & certificate from the school. Recently our PM received the award of CHAMPION of the Earth for her outstanding initiative on\u00a0increasing forests and going green. I am simply trying to follow her path to make a change. Because I believe, OXYGEN is the most needed thing on earth and one can not simply buy a healthy environment with money.

The City Administration regulated the matter for new buildings as well as existing ones. The latter faced a variety of unforeseen problems that resulted into a 10% compliance rate in 15 months since the law passed. In the common understanding, this means a public effort not hitting the target, a cracked relationship between the City Administration and private businesses and ultimately disadvantaged people still vulnerable.\nThe story begins in 2015 with the City of Milan to pass the Building Regulation article 77 that required all bars, shops, restaurants and craft activities bordering the road, to provide easy access to people with limited mobility or disabilities (the National Institute of Statistic in 2007 assessed 13.189 people with mobility disabilities in Milan). This normative action was the instrument that City of Milan deployed to overcome architectural barriers and provide universal free access to public places by 2017.\n\nIn November 2016, 12 month after the law passed the City of Milan assessed only 2.000 businesses compliant over 18.000. An article on la Repubblica, the second most read Italian newspaper, by the 5 January 2017, published these data and opened a public discussion on the subject.\nLisa Noja (delegate of the Major for accessibility policies) said: We have to make sure that very quickly all businesses comply. This year we want to get to the full application of a rule of civilization and to do that you cannot only use repressive strategies.\nIt was a beginning of a twist in the Municipal strategy and the start of a speculation about the most effective way to enforce a regulation. The new thinking included working with trade associations, like Confcommercio, as well as promoting campaigns to engage business holders.\nCristina Tajani (City Councillor for labour policies, businesses, trade and human resources) said: places that show attention to the disabled are also easily accessible to children, parents with strollers and the elderly. This does not mean that they will not be submitted to controls, but we want help the business understand that the adjustment should not only be seen as an obligation. It is also a business opportunity.\nThis is when OpenCare approach came handy. Local staff including WeMake was involved and started talking to as many people as possible, to understand what was not working and tentatively get it streight.\nListening\u00a0it was vital to start from the pieces of the City Administration that were involved from the beginning like the Major Cabinet, the Urbanistic Department, the Public Soil Occupation Office and lately Urban Economy and Work department. We have understood that the building legislation was conceived in a department and the implementing regulation was written in a different one (and of course published through another one). That gave a lot of room to officers for interpretations and tightening the instructions for businesses to prevent opportunistic behaviors. \u00a0\u00a0\nIncluding as the collaboration with the trade association got closed we\u2019ve understood more of the problems that businesses are facing to comply with the regulation, such as: high costs, complex red tape, lack of understanding of the most suitable solution and existing solutions too standardized. Since red tape is partially due to complex implementing regulations and the unclear communication follows, we started facilitating a mutual dialogue between pieces of public administration, businesses and associations. Regarding costs and production related problems, we can take it into the arena of manufacturing 4.0 by including also designers, makers, social innovators, businesses and utilizers.\nGoing where innovation beats\u00a0we have started organizing an experimentation called Open Rampe (Rampe means Ramps/Slides) in a limited area of the city that has everything it takes. The Quartiere Isola in fact has a functioning District for Urban Commerce, a civic center devoted to urban regeneration, art and crafts workshops (ADA stecca), active businesses and a long tradition of civic participation. Our idea is to engage business individually and through a public event by 11th April. Involving them into\u00a0co-design sessions pivoting around their necessities may generate unexpected outcomes.\nDealing with collective intelligence\u00a0is what we have just started doing by sharing this story here. Any input from the community could be brought into our experimentation and add value to it. It would be interesting to study this collaboration as it happens and share it.\nThis is where we stand now and the next steps are:\nCo-designing / mobilizing resources\u00a0of course we will not predefine outputs, but rather keep the sessions open to any outcomes.\nPrototyping policies\u00a0by monitoring and evaluating this experimentation.\nWe are aware that talking about \u201cenforcing\u201d a policy collaboratively may sounds an oxymoron. Since article 77 of the building regulation fits in the EU and the National legal frameworks, it is certainly a top down process.\u00a0Nevertheless, the Open care approach might help policy makers, (non)compliant businesses, users and citizens to achieve simpler, cheaper and faster solutions.\nIt would be interesting to know who else has been involved in a similar process and managed it collaboratively.

Even good policies may be limited in their effectiveness - that is by the time they cascade down to the level of effect/impact they are often either diluted or do not produce the effects desired by the original intentions of the policy no matter how well meaning these might be.\u00a0Another way to look at it would be this: living systems theory has turned on its head the Victorian world-view that imagined that unless mankind were imposing order from top down then chaos would ensue. The new sciences - nano biology, quantum theory - have revealed the extent to which order is a natural impulse (fractals\u00a0being a beautify example) and that many of mankind\u2019s efforts to date have disrupted this impulse.\nSo what does this say about policy? How do we understand more effective ways to enable our natural impulse as human beings to be caring and compassionate? How do we re-conceive of policies in the light of this - to support and not disrupt the collective impulse to help our fellow human beings?\u00a0\nFrom this understanding - how do we understand the instruments and tools of the collective, of citizens - what do they look like in relation to health and social care? Equally, how do we understand the instruments and tools of the state (such as policy) - how can these be designed to enable the collective response that is the basis of welfare in traditional societies?\nThe next question would then be how this might inform the nature of the session you\u2019d offer.

Attraverso un processo di ricerca abbiamo evidenziato come un approccio olistico, che a colpo d\u2019occhio fornisca un quadro clinico completo, comporterebbe indubbi vantaggi a medici e pazienti.\n\n1.2 Acquisizione di idee, spunti, intuizioni\n\nLo spunto iniziale che ha dato l\u2019avvio al progetto \u00e8 scaturito da una serie di interviste condotte tra medici e pazienti. Questi ultimi in particolare lamentavano la scarsa preparazione del medico rispetto al loro specifico caso clinico, delegando pertanto al paziente stesso, la responsabilit\u00e0 nel fornire informazioni dettagliate circa la patologia da affrontare.\n\n1.3 Definizione del problema\n\nIl problema che abbiamo affrontato pu\u00f2 essere definito come una carenza di comunicazione. I diversi professionisti della cura non possiedono, ad oggi, uno strumento semplice e veloce che possa tenerli aggiornati rispetto alla progressione clinica di ogni loro paziente. Le informazioni sanitarie sono disgregate e appartengono allo specialista che le ha prodotte attraverso la propria visita. Queste informazioni tendenzialmente non hanno altro modo di essere condivise, se non attraverso il paziente stesso, cui si delega il compito e la responsabilit\u00e0 di fornire tali informazioni allo specialista successivo.\n\nDoc.doc si propone essenzialmente come un aggregatore di informazioni, un unico database medico nel quale possano essere convogliati e organizzati i dati dei pazienti che si hanno in cura. In questo modo il medico pu\u00f2 affrontare ogni nuova visita avendo gi\u00e0 chiara l\u2019anamnesi pregressa del paziente in questione. Doc.doc inoltre fornisce tutti i contatti degli specialisti che hanno condotto una determinata visita in precedenza, e rende estremamente semplice (un clic) la possibilit\u00e0 di mettersi in contatto con un collega per richiedere un chiarimento o un parere rispetto ai dettagli di una certa una cartella clinica.\n\n2.0 Definizione\n\n2.1 Analisi delle soluzioni\n\nIn seguito ad una estesa sessione di una particolare forma di brainstorming, il brainwriting, sono stati vagliati diversi possibili approcci per affrontare il tema proposto dal bando OpenCare. Questi sono stati categorizzati in modo sistematico secondo la tecnica detta delle 4Cs (le quattro\u201dc\u201d: components, characteristics, challenges, characters) e quindi circoscritti in macro-aree che puntavano ad un certo specifico orientamento verso la risoluzione delle problematiche riscontrate in ambito sanitario.\n\n2.2 Ideazione del concept\n\nIn seguito ai risultati scaturiti dalle tecniche di brainstorming, \u00e8 stato realizzato un questionario da sottoporre ad un certo numero di pazienti, parenti dei pazienti e professionisti della cura (non solo medici, ma anche infermieri, farmacisti, fisioterapisti etc\u2026).\n\nQueste interviste si sono rivelate cruciali nel definire il percorso che doc.doc avrebbe intrapreso.\n\nInfatti, abbiamo riscontrato presso la maggior parte dei pazienti intervistati, una sostanziale insoddisfazione riguardo i processi di comunicazione con i propri medici. In particolare, nel caso di patologie particolarmente complesse, dove \u00e8 necessario il coinvolgimento di molteplici specialisti, spesso i medici coinvolti sono parzialmente o totalmente all\u2019oscuro riguardo i progressi dei colleghi nei confronti di uno specifico aspetto nella cura della patologia. La comunicazione di queste informazioni, avviene, ma quasi esclusivamente per mezzo del paziente, il quale \u00e8 costretto ad assumersi la piena responsabilit\u00e0 dell\u2019accuratezza e completezza delle informazioni fornite.\n\n2.3 Proposta della soluzione\n\nIn seguito alla ricerca svolta, \u00e8 stato quindi logico cominciare a pensare alla progettazione di uno strumento gestionale che permettesse ai medici di avere immediatamente disponibili tutte le informazioni concernente un certo paziente, comprese le informazioni di contatto dei colleghi responsabili di una certa visita.\n\nAbbiamo cos\u00ec progettato uno strumento gestionale che facilita l\u2019organizzazione degli appuntamenti di un medico, ordina in maniera chiara le cartelle cliniche dei pazienti per tipologia e cronologia, permette in un clic di contattare un collega tramite telefono, chat o email, infine rende pi\u00f9 efficiente la visita stessa poich\u00e9 doc.doc consente al medico curante di aggiornarsi circa i progressi del proprio paziente nei minuti precedenti alla visita.\n\nDoc.doc infatti pu\u00f2 essere programmato per concedere uno spazio di tempo (tendenzialmente 10 minuti) tra una visita e l\u2019altra, che permetta al medico di prendere visione della cartella clinica del paziente che sta per incontrare.\n\n3.0 Sviluppo\n\n3.1 Progettazione e prova del prototipo\n\nDoc.doc allo stato attuale consiste in un prototipo interattivo realizzato attraverso la piattaforma proto.io.\n\nPrima di ottenere questo risultato abbiamo sostenuto una approfondita analisi UX che ci ha consentito di effettuare scelte precise circa lo sviluppo di certe funzionalit\u00e0.\u00a0In particolare, attraverso tecniche di Brainwriting e alcune empathy map abbiamo circoscritto l\u2019ambito di lavoro.\n\nA seguito di alcune interviste di orientamento con pazienti e professionisti sanitari abbiamo definito ulteriormente gli obiettivi del progetto, concentrandoci su una \u201cone primary task\u201d, che nel caso di doc.doc consiste nell\u2019aggregazione semplificata dei dati di ogni paziente. Considerando quindi alcuni ipotetici scenari di utilizzo del nostro servizio (presso specialisti\u00a0o medici di base, in studio o in visita a domicilio etc\u2026) abbiamo sviluppato una prima logica di user flow e infine la sua realizzazione grafica interattiva, della quale si pu\u00f2 avere una tangibile esperienza d\u2019uso qui: http://bit.ly/2oOXbmK (una volta scaricata l'intera\u00a0cartella \u00e8 sufficiente aprire il file index.html con il proprio browser, meglio se Chrome).\n\nInoltre in seguito allo sviluppo del prototipo \u00e8 stato condotto un piccolo usability testing\u00a0che ha evidenziato piccole problematiche, immediatamente risolte con il rilascio della versione successiva, di cui si pu\u00f2 prendere visione al link sopracitato.\n\n3.2\u00a0Prova della fruibilit\u00e0\n\nE\u2019 stato condotto un piccolo usability testing, parzialmente moderato, che ha sostanzialmente confermato tutti gli obiettivi di usabilit\u00e0 stabiliti a monte. In particolare i nostri utenti test sono stati, per la maggior parte, in grado di portare a termine le operazioni richieste, quali: 1. Consultare una cartella clinica, 2. Consultare la rubrica pazienti e professionisti, 3. Aggiungere un nuovo appuntamento, 4. Contattare un collega. In questa fase abbiamo ritenuto prematuro considerare ulteriore metriche di controllo oggettive quali tempi e statistiche di errore, concentrandoci piuttosto su misurazioni di gradimento soggettive e mantenendo come unico conteggio obiettivo il numero di operazioni portate a buon fine.\n\nSono stati riscontrati alcuni problemi nella fruibilit\u00e0 dei dati della cartella clinica e delle funzionalit\u00e0 ad essa collegate (\u00e8 infatti possibile anche iniziare una conversazione\u00a0con un collega). L\u2019organizzazione dei contenuti di quella determinata schermata \u00e8 stata quindi modificata sulla base dei feedback ricevuti, cos\u00ec come l\u2019intero look&feel dell\u2019applicazione \u00e8 stato rivisto coerentemente rispetto alle modifiche apportate.\n\n4.0 Rilascio\n\n4.1 Completamento del prodotto/servizio\n\nIl prototipo \u00e8 gi\u00e0 stato testato, ma andrebbe ulteriormente verificato su un campione pi\u00f9 esteso di utenti, seguito eventualmente da un A/B testing.\n\nConclusa la fase di usability testing sul prototipo, si proceder\u00e0 quindi con lo sviluppo di programmazione vero e proprio, la\u00a0cui funzionalit\u00e0\u00a0verr\u00e0\u00a0verificata\u00a0ad ogni milestone raggiunta.\n\nInfine, verranno concepite strategie di distribuzione, idealmente con il coinvolgimento delle ASL locali, per permettere un capillare ed effettivo utilizzo del servizio.\n\n4.2 Rilascio finale\n\nE\u2019 in fase di definizione una timeline di sviluppo che presenti le milestone necessarie al completamento del prodotto, secondo specifiche tempistiche.\n\n4.3 Produzione\n\nIl team di sviluppo tecnico \u00e8 ancora da definirsi, ma stiamo valutando una collaborazione con I-SEE\u00a0(http://www.i-seecomputing.com), specialisti nell produzione di software in ambito medico/ sanitario.", "created_at": "2017-11-30 01:04:27.764012", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:31:48.816937", "tag_id": 1565, "post_id": 33729, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 6578}, {"id": 9554, "text": null, "quote": "Power Makes us Sick (PMS) is a creative research project focusing on autonomous health care practices and networks from a feminist perspective.

Is it possible to \"jump a generation\" in the organization of health care provision in developping countries? This is the underlying question of the \"modern\" collaborative care expriences we are going to share in this post about Coeur d'Or.\nAs a short backgrund, Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) induce yearly about 17 millions of deaths. Over 75% of those deaths occur in LMICs where risk factors are highly prevalent and the health system is poorly adapted to deal with chronicle and highly expensive emergent conditions. In Benin, the prevalence of high blood pressure is about 30%. Health promotion on this poorly funded issue, in this limited resource setting, requires innovative communication tools. To this end, C\u0153ur d\u2019Or (www.facebook.com/groups/coeurdor/ ) was created in 2011, to test the feasibility of using social media for providing promotional and preventive care against CVD in Benin, in a collaborative way.\nWe aim\u00a0here to present briefly\u00a0C\u0153ur d\u2019Or , and some lessons learned so far.

It runs as a tool of keeping in touch with a huge number of the community members, allowing for a double-sense communication, spreading cutting-edge information on CVDs and building a community-based leadership on CVD. The targets are young, mainly from urban and semi-urban areas, educated and active on social media. They connect to the platform using mainly smartphones.\u00a0 A wide range of subjects related to CVDs and Non-Communicable Diseases are discussed from several perspectives. Members can initiate a discussion stream, receive inputs from several profiles of members and get a summary from a medical expert based on key evidence-based prevention measures against CVD.\nThe group stands also as a social mobilization and community participation tools influencing the agenda setting at the national level. It is currently a member of the Multisectorial National Committee against NCDs in Benin, as a leading actor supporting the organization of national campaigns against CVD in Benin each year since 2011.\u00a0 Using its online critical mass and its growing network in traditional media and several public and private institutions, the group is capable of mobilizing each year since 2013 material and financial resources up to 25,000 \u20ac to organize offline activities such as a walk (about 5000 participants each year), risk factors screening, interactive conferences during the world heart day. All those activities help at reaching people that are not active online and are done with the leadership of members that are not health workers.\nThe rapid development of telecommunications improves the access of a growing number of people to Internet and social media. A critical mass of the group improves its political influence and creates a web tool that can help for a viral diffusion.\nC\u0153ur d\u2019Or demonstrates the feasibility of using social media as an innovative approach for offering promotional and preventive care on health issues in sub-Saharan Africa.

In health systems with developed infrastructure, physicians regularly examine the breast as part of a routine female check-up (usually once or twice a year) in addition to mammography. However, this routine procedure is \u00a0provided at varying levels of time investment and care.\nDiscovering hands has a number of advantages:\nBy using the extraordinary sensory capabilities of visually impaired women, a perceived \u201cdisability\u201d is transformed into a capability. A completely new field of meaningful employment is created.\n\u201cMedical Tactile Examiners\u201d (MTEs) are trained to deliver physical breast examinations at doctors\u2019 practices. During a 9-month training period they learn how to use a standardized diagnostic method for examining the female breast. Additionally, all MTEs are trained in communication skills and breast-specific psychology, as well as administrative tasks typically carried out by a doctor\u2019s assistant. MTEs are either directly employed by resident doctors or hospitals, or they work for different practices and/or hospitals on a freelance basis.\nConventionally, a regular breast examination carried out by a gynecologist takes between 1 and 3 minutes. The discovering hands MTE invests at least 30 minutes for each session, not only examining the breast, but also educating patients on how to cope with the risk of breast cancer. Patients feel that they are well taken care of and receive the best possible preventive examination in a pleasant environment.\nPreliminary qualitative results, conducted by the University of Essen, show that MTEs detect ~50% more and ~28% smaller tissue alterations in the breast than doctors (5-8mm vs. 10-15mm). A clinical, peer reviewed study is currently being conducted at the University of Erlangen.\nOur vision\nWe are operating as a social business because we believe in the our value proposition (to the healthcare sector, and institutions supporting people with disabilities). We are committed to the social \"win-win\" of our model: offering meaningful employment to blind women, and creating an opportunity for them where they have competitive strength; and helping to improve the breast cancer early identification situation and awareness for the most common cancer among women.\nCurrent roll-out\nDiscovering hands is planning to substantially increase the number of MTEs in the years to come. We currently operate in Germany and in Austria. In both India and Colombia we have pilot projects running with scale-up in planning. And we are interested in further country roll-out, which we operate through a social franchise.\nIf you are a social entrepreneur and would like to implement discovering hands in your country, contact us. Also, if you are an impact investor and are interested in collaborating with us to further roll-out the model, please contact us too.

For many (new) health issues there is yet little knowledge. Often the research is guided by profit-driven decisions, in the interest of big pharmaceutical corporations or exclusively within the analytic tradition.\n\nTo look at care as a life practice. We take a health issue like histamine intolerance as a concrete example for which it is clear and mandatory that food intake and lifestyle are determining the severity of the health condition. In defining \u201cCare\u201d I would like to work around the question: Is our diet and lifestyle shaped around products or can we brake out of this path and empower ourselves in designing products - an app in this case - that help us define which food and lifestyle combination is better for each unique person? Can a tool help eventually finding one's way to still eat or drink that food by combining it differently and so on?\n\nNeed or problem you are attempting to solve*\nHow can one learn to listen to her body and track, compare, and be systematic with the help of technology. The idea is to help people to be more in touch with their body rather than alienate from it. How to empower users with a system that guides them in tracking aliments and environmental reactions, observe cross behaviors, and share that information with other users. A guided digital diary can be very helpful in a case like histamine intolerance where the combination of foods, cooking and food preservation, as well as lifestyle, and environmental conditions, all play a great role, in an intricate and complex combination. Histamine intolerance has been chosen as a concrete case to work with because it's a health condition I suffer from myself and for which I would like to have a tool that helps me deal with it. From a developer standpoint it will be a tool that I can test in first person. Next to it, there are more and more friends who have found they are affected by this condition, so it will be as well easy to find a group of people for preliminary usability testing.\n\u200bBeneficiary, single person and/or community*\nBeneficiary will be both single persons and the community in a mutual exchange between users affected by the health condition and those who want to participate and make use of the app like doctors, researchers, practitioners and more.\n\nSolution, brief description of the project*\nA first version of the app will be essentially A GUIDED FOOD DIARY.\nObtain information and make your own list of safe foods, referring to a build-in food list of: high-histamine, anti-histamine, anti-inflammatory and cross- check it with a list of typical symptoms and reactions.\u00a0The idea is to allow users to add #tag foods, behaviors, and symptoms with the intention to generate knowledge and work in the direction of creating a community and use data-analysis for a second version of the app.\u00a0The food diary can help create awareness and be a systematic tool in finding out which foods provoke reactions and to which degree.\u00a0It can help to expand one's diet, follow elimination diet systems, help re-introduce single foods, and monitor whether these provoke any reactions or not. It can help apply more logic to why certain symptoms occur and when. It can be used to help one's general practitioner or specialist in doing more targeted testing. It can be a great support in case of multiple intolerances as well.\n\u200bTechnologies already adopted or that you are planning to adopt*\nWe are a two-women team whit design and development skills.

This led straight into individual and collective reflection and the mapping of questions that mattered to participants. Here, three key issues emerged, which participants gathered in three working groups to address.\nOne group tackled the question of \"How can we provide care and preventative care adequately and accessibly?\" in a process of collective brainstorming and idea development. As a central starting point was the agreement that care and prevention services should be provided by real people for real people, and thus to counteract the further dehumanization in care - both toward those being cared for, but also the caregivers themselves, as has been spreading as a result of the savings and efficiency measures, particularly in the public sector care, such as hospitals and nursing homes,. Based on this arose an idea for central, physical places and spaces in which cross-generational knowledge sharing communities with a decentralized \"bottom-up\" structure can develop. This should activate the local community at large and encourage more people to visit and thus bringing them together. Simultaneously, through the use of modern telecommunications and the Internet, communities that are located in remote areas will be included \u2013 the challenge of inadequate or even non-existent Internet connections in these areas could be countered by open-source technology solutions, such as balloons that are equipped with Internet. The necessary financial resources could be generated by a crowdfunding campaign, also to generate more public attention, especially online, for teaching/learning/exchange spaces for this innovation and strengthen the cohesion of the existing community. A key component of the engagement in these areas could be workshops of all types and themes to be organized, offered and held by participants themselves. These spaces could make a contribution to the initial formulation of questions, because a social community that is open and accessible for all faces the challenge of accessibility to prevention and care, supported by the Internet. Care and prevention again become a matter for the community, and are thus realized in a humane and proportionate way.\nThis common \"bottom-up\" structure was made tangible in a first prototyping, which opened the question \"How can we engage individuals to support these structures, even if they ostensibly do not (yet) benefit from them?\"\nThe prototype incorporated the approach of small and relatively autonomous systems where the supply and demand of communities for health and social themes can not only be met, but also that such knowledge can be bundled onsite and via the internet everyone has access to the spaces. Decisions about the design of health promoting coexistence are shaped by the particpating actors themselves. Finally, assumptions were formulated, which should be examined, scrutinized and discussed in the network in order to make this approach more effective and more efficient. Because even subtle or unconscious perceptions and attitudes can potentially be found in each concept, it needs to be balanced by many, diverse and also conflicting perspectives on the concept to make it more resistant. It was also reflected that a certain basic attitude is required of all potential participants to form these care and prevention networks. Another important point is posed by the question of: \"How can momentum be created for these spaces and networks?\"\nAnother group addressed the question of: \"How can we, based on commonalities, learn more from each other?\" In a idea development and brainstorming process on this issue, the importance of local and personal interaction was recognized. This includes the networking of stakeholders and users, potentially through an interactive map on the Internet such as used by www.berlinimwandel.de. It also requires the organizing of engaging workshops where actors can share their enthusiasm for relevant topics with others by presenting them as relevant themes, and optionally also to demonstrate activities to make them tangible. In addition, activities such as role reversals to expand the individuals' horizons of experience are possible, as is done, for example, in working with \"age suits\" \u2013 young people slip into full-body suits equipped with weights to enable the experience of having an aged body.\nIn a first prototype lifting the existing resources were, theoretically and practically, visualized through a mapping of individual and collaborative networking, both online and offline and person. This process led to the realization that everything is actually there to the realization of this idea already what is needed, when the dedicated actors gathered as OPENandChange workshop, work together and share their resources and combine theory with practice. These assumptions to check it seems important in the first step to begin with themselves, so to make the possibility of designing a different world tangible. This iterative process leads to fresh insights. But the community-based approach not only leads to new insights, but can lead to a higher incidence of fun and joy, and ultimately health and well-being by strengthening group working experiences.\nThe third working group focused on the question: \"How can we increase the societal appreciation for a public welfare oriented social system?\" Also during this idea development and brainstorming process, the need for people to meet in person in \"their\" area, city, country was emphasized. For example, working in interactive groups can lead to an intensification of togetherness and can make prevention and care topic. The supposedly negative connotations otherwise associated with these concepts such as disease, death and a feeling of helplessness are thus transformed. A positive attitude towards the subject is promoted, fears can be reduced, and at the same time the respect and appreciation for the work of nurses and caregivers is increased. In particular, a playful approach to the subject can support this project and convey the idea that all can benefit. Another important aspect for answering the initial question is to explore the current actual situation in care. The question as to why the appreciation in prevention and care sector is so low can lead to valuable information to help find solutions. In prototyping, the motto of \"living appreciation\" was made tangible and concrete: Care and prevention spaces would be established in the middle of society, fulfilling the basic needs of all, which ensures the participation of all so that this approach corresponds to the wishes of all and fulfills their needs. To test this assumption requires a thorough basic research of existing resources, as well as bureaucratic hurdles, and to examine stakeholders, especially those who are not participating.\nBased on the work of the three groups, the following definition of the problems was generated:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Dehumanization of health and social systems \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The focus on treating symptoms rather than promoting healthy lifestyles \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Privatization and capitalization of public goods, which should be accessible to all \nThe concrete solution that the participants collectively devised, states that:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0All we need is there if we work together and share our resources\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0A paradigm shift is needed: \"From Pathogenesis to Salutogenesis\" \u2013 Solidary Health Promotion System with Global Knowledge Network and Local Action Spaces \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Working \"with people for people\" and connect visionaries, experts, institutions and places through concrete actions \nThis solution leads to the following intended:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Employing existing treasures: Mapping for individual and community networking, online and in person, in theory and practice \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Practising appreciation: Create care and prevention spaces in the middle of society to fulfill the basic needs of all and create new incentive/recognition structures in the long term \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Local systemic change: Developing new skills, resources and infrastructure that can be used by all of us: children, young people, adults, seniors (people in all phases of life). \nStrong arguments for the proposal are:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Bottom-up structure with small relatively autonomous systems, who self-regulate the supply and demand of health and social services for individuals and communities \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Only through shared ownership effectiveness and sustainability can this be secured \nOur approaches, technologies and tactics are:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Active participation of ALL leads to a prototype that works for the majority and meets their needs (human-centered development of global platform and local spaces) \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Collective, iterative structure combining theory and practice \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Global Knowledge Network \u2013 CAREPEDIA: bundled knowledge (Internet / platform) all have access to the \"central office\" \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Local Action Spaces: Locally designed and managed spaces for health-promoting coexistence \"From Pathogenesis to Salutogenesis\"\nWe believe our solution will work because: We have existing needs (more than 80% of people want a functional and appreciative system for care and prevention ) and real effects from a dehumanized health and care system. We know many people and institutions that are interested in cooperating and who would gladly contribute their respective expertise. Another world is within reach. There are many projects and movements to prove it. We shall make this even more visible. Everything we need is already there. We need the courage to try it, to experience and live it. We can make an active contribution to this. Financial resources are not a challenge or necessity to achieve this.\nAs expected results \u2013 in the context of existing cases \u2013 we use the following examples: Successful EcoVillages such as Mondragon (a community in the Basque Country without police). Giving spaces, exchange meets and free shops. Micro-agriculture in the city. Urban gardening. Community-supported agriculture creates new relationships between city and land. There are urban farming initiatives in Detroit, critical consumption movements in Italy (GAS), alternative currency systems such as WIR in Switzerland, and solidarity networks for food supply and health clinics in Greece, as well as Networks such as SOLIDAGO and Artabana in Germany. And many more.\nFurthermore, our proposal is confirmed by literature and scientific consensus such as in the field of neuronal research: Fear paralyzes reason and creativity and leads to depression due to stress and alienation . Yet willingness for lifelong learning, creates new neural connections. Further scientific findings such as the Hierarchy of Needs Maslow, the concept of The Ever-Present Origin (Stuttgart 1949-1953) by Jean Gebser, the classic theories of J.M. Baldwin, G.H. Mead, J. Piaget (The Psychology of the Child) and L. Kohlberg as well as related work by C. Gilligan, F. Oser and M. Parsons. Also the literature and research by Ken Wilber, Aurobindo Ghose, Ervin L\u00e1szl\u00f3, Don Beck, and Michael Murphy; \u00a0work on Emotional Intelligence by Daniel Goleman, und the research by Kropotkin, who proved that cooperation is more important than competition in the animal kingdom and is effective for the survival of the group. Also the ample literature on the topics of sustainable lifestyles, Solidarity economy, Holacracy and Sociocracy support our suggested solution.\nHowever, it is necessary to keep sight of the risks. Here there are also a number of examples that could occur either externally or internally: The risk that corporations hijack the ideas and commercialize them, such as happened with Carsharing and CoLiving. External factors such as war, social conflicts, the collapse of the financial system, climate change and its consequences, privatization of public goods such as drinking water, and environmental disasters could endanger our plans.\nBut also our inner monsters, such as greed and the hunger for power \u00a0could torpedo the project. There is always a danger that the idea is not accepted, that the needs of the stakeholders are not met or met only partially; that there are \"too many cooks\" or that the concept can not be implemented due to conflicting priorities, or dependencies between partners and networks arise.\nYet we see possibilities to work against these risks. Reality has proven that it already works, and many people are working toward this aim worldwide:\nWe are many! We cooperate and we are a network. We have sufficient human capacity. Our approach is flexible and can be used in existing structures and institutions. Dependence on existing systems and infrastructures can be solved via an \"open-source\" approach that leads to a multiplying effect, where copying is allowed and actively encouraged.\nThis leads to the reduction of fears, relaxation, deceleration, satisfaction and happiness. There will be systemic relief or elimination of the superfluous, as well as personal and societal development potential through inclusion and the integration of \"fringe groups\" such as unemployed, refugees or marginalized citizens.\nFor evaluation it is intended to study these criteria and assumptions in order to confirm them: Self-organization in groups works. Positions, attitudes and values are part of a common vision. Skills are included and allocated according to an open source principle. The new system or the new platform reaches more people and connects more participants than previous systems or platforms. There are spaces where encounters already take place. Spaces can be created where encounters are possible. Spaces that meet various needs lead to added value for all.\nInterestingly, it can be stated that all three working groups arrived at very similar approaches and ideas, problems and solutions during this intense, exciting and inspiring eight hour workshop: A change of perspective and a paradigm shift is required - instead of focusing on fighting disease, working towards the promotion of health!\nCaroline Paulick-Thiel & Jahn Harrison, nextlearning e.V.\nTranslation: Alexander Paulick-Thiel", "created_at": "2017-05-22 18:20:03", "updated_at": "2017-05-22 18:20:03", "tag_id": 1354, "post_id": 542, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 509}, {"id": 9604, "text": null, "quote": "Also, how do you maintain patient privacy while treating people on the street?

Voici notre proposition:\u00a0\nUne nouvelle Maison du Peuple!\nAujourd\u2019hui est un jour historique pour Bruxelles. Apr\u00e8s de longs mois d\u2019incertitude, le conseil communal \u00e0 enfin tranch\u00e9: le Palais de la Bourse deviendra le lieu commun de tous les bruxellois. Ils ont \u00e0 nouveau une Maison du Peuple!\nCe temple architectural est \u00e9videmment d\u2019abord un choix symbolique. Apr\u00e8s y avoir accept\u00e9 la tr\u00e8s controvers\u00e9e exposition Behind The Numbers glorifiant le n\u00e9o-liberalisme, la Ville s\u2019est rendue compte qu\u2019il fallait donner une autre destination \u00e0 cet endroit que celle de pure sp\u00e9culation commerciale et d'activit\u00e9 touristique. En transformant une partie de la Bourse en Maison du Peuple elle redonne une place aux Bruxellois au c\u0153ur du centre historique!\nDonnez la ville aux habitants, et tout le monde s\u2019en portera mieux\nOn ne comptait plus le nombre d\u2019actions contre les plans de la Ville: plates-formes citoyennes, regroupements de commer\u00e7ants, actions ludiques diverses... Qui ne se souvient du banc de 30 m d\u00e9pos\u00e9 au milieu de la Grand place, ou des centaines de gens pique-niquant place de la Bourse, de l'action de revendication des escaliers de la Bourse comme tribune libre d'expression politique lors du KunstenFestivaldesarts? L\u2019espace public \u00e9tait devenu un haut lieu de d\u00e9bat, mais paradoxalement ne recevait pas d\u2019endroit ad\u00e9quat pour le mener (une Agora). La participation ne remuait que du vent, les riverains ne se sentaient pas entendus. La ville \u00e9tait taill\u00e9e sur mesure pour les eurocrates, les touristes Chinois, avec commerces ouverts le dimanche, tandis que le Bruxellois devait se contenter d\u2019une ville certes prestigieuse, mais sans lieu o\u00f9 il fait bon vivre, une ville d'exp\u00e9riences individuelles juxtapos\u00e9es, atomis\u00e9es, sans liens.\nLe Beer Tempel projet\u00e9 dans le Palais de la Bourse aura une entr\u00e9e par l\u2019arri\u00e8re, et c'est tr\u00e8s bien ainsi. Mais sans occuper tout l'espace, il comprendra une nouvelle Maison du Peuple, o\u00f9 chacun pourrait d\u00e9battre de ce qui se passe dans la ville, o\u00f9 les initiatives bottom-up pourront cro\u00eetre, de nouvelles id\u00e9es pour une ville meilleure surgir. Il importe de faire de ce lieu symbolique qu'est la Bourse un espace de libre d\u00e9bat, une Agora. Il s'agit de rendre la ville aux habitants pour que tout le monde en profite, pour que l\u2019habitant s\u2019y sente bien. Alors le touriste, le commer\u00e7ant et tout les autres s'y sentiront bien aussi.\nLa Ville esp\u00e8re avec cette Maison du Peuple calmer les tensions palpables par le biais d\u2019une communication plus ouverte: un endroit de rencontre et d\u2019\u00e9coute sera ainsi am\u00e9nag\u00e9 dans le b\u00e2timent. En revitalisant de cette fa\u00e7on la Bourse, en lui donnant une \u00e9chelle humaine, la Ville aide \u00e0 fabriquer le tissu social des prochaines d\u00e9cennies. Bien s\u00fbr, le touriste y aura sa place, car la Maison du peuple sera ouverte a tous. Mais nous ne voulons pas que la centralit\u00e9 habit\u00e9e soit confisqu\u00e9e par une vitrine \u00e0 touristes.

This is partly because we are a small crowded island and could do with more houses but it is also because we have an excess of money, and it tends to accumulate in the hands of a minority.\nIn care, the result is that individuals and even the state find it increasingly hard to acquire care homes and they attract private equity and hedge funds who treat staff as human \"resources\" and patients as \"consumers\" of health care services, squeezing the system to extract wealth.\nThis is, arguably, an extreme way of presenting the situation (after all, even hedge funds have to employ managers, many of whom are very professional and caring). However the fact is that having \"owners\" who have different drivers and values from the care-givers causes a tension that too often results in quality of care taking second place to \"delivery of health services\", which is quite a different thing.\nA useful parallel is the struggle many communities have to create affordable housing. An interesting and succesful innovation has been the community land trust, where land is acquired by or on behalf of the community and held in trust over the long term. They make the land available for affordable housing. Separating out the ownership of the land from the occupation of the land allows people who couldn't otherwise afford to occupy the land to come in and use it, subject to the conditions set down by the trust. We imagine a similar type of structure.\nTo put it another way, using financial language, owning land has a different time horizon and a different risk profile\u00a0 from owning a business. A care home that separates the two can attract different sorts of capital for the two different needs, and thus more closely match the interests of the investors with the interests of the stakeholders.

This led straight into individual and collective reflection and the mapping of questions that mattered to participants. Here, three key issues emerged, which participants gathered in three working groups to address.\nOne group tackled the question of \"How can we provide care and preventative care adequately and accessibly?\" in a process of collective brainstorming and idea development. As a central starting point was the agreement that care and prevention services should be provided by real people for real people, and thus to counteract the further dehumanization in care - both toward those being cared for, but also the caregivers themselves, as has been spreading as a result of the savings and efficiency measures, particularly in the public sector care, such as hospitals and nursing homes,. Based on this arose an idea for central, physical places and spaces in which cross-generational knowledge sharing communities with a decentralized \"bottom-up\" structure can develop. This should activate the local community at large and encourage more people to visit and thus bringing them together. Simultaneously, through the use of modern telecommunications and the Internet, communities that are located in remote areas will be included \u2013 the challenge of inadequate or even non-existent Internet connections in these areas could be countered by open-source technology solutions, such as balloons that are equipped with Internet. The necessary financial resources could be generated by a crowdfunding campaign, also to generate more public attention, especially online, for teaching/learning/exchange spaces for this innovation and strengthen the cohesion of the existing community. A key component of the engagement in these areas could be workshops of all types and themes to be organized, offered and held by participants themselves. These spaces could make a contribution to the initial formulation of questions, because a social community that is open and accessible for all faces the challenge of accessibility to prevention and care, supported by the Internet. Care and prevention again become a matter for the community, and are thus realized in a humane and proportionate way.\nThis common \"bottom-up\" structure was made tangible in a first prototyping, which opened the question \"How can we engage individuals to support these structures, even if they ostensibly do not (yet) benefit from them?\"\nThe prototype incorporated the approach of small and relatively autonomous systems where the supply and demand of communities for health and social themes can not only be met, but also that such knowledge can be bundled onsite and via the internet everyone has access to the spaces. Decisions about the design of health promoting coexistence are shaped by the particpating actors themselves. Finally, assumptions were formulated, which should be examined, scrutinized and discussed in the network in order to make this approach more effective and more efficient. Because even subtle or unconscious perceptions and attitudes can potentially be found in each concept, it needs to be balanced by many, diverse and also conflicting perspectives on the concept to make it more resistant. It was also reflected that a certain basic attitude is required of all potential participants to form these care and prevention networks. Another important point is posed by the question of: \"How can momentum be created for these spaces and networks?\"\nAnother group addressed the question of: \"How can we, based on commonalities, learn more from each other?\" In a idea development and brainstorming process on this issue, the importance of local and personal interaction was recognized. This includes the networking of stakeholders and users, potentially through an interactive map on the Internet such as used by www.berlinimwandel.de. It also requires the organizing of engaging workshops where actors can share their enthusiasm for relevant topics with others by presenting them as relevant themes, and optionally also to demonstrate activities to make them tangible. In addition, activities such as role reversals to expand the individuals' horizons of experience are possible, as is done, for example, in working with \"age suits\" \u2013 young people slip into full-body suits equipped with weights to enable the experience of having an aged body.\nIn a first prototype lifting the existing resources were, theoretically and practically, visualized through a mapping of individual and collaborative networking, both online and offline and person. This process led to the realization that everything is actually there to the realization of this idea already what is needed, when the dedicated actors gathered as OPENandChange workshop, work together and share their resources and combine theory with practice. These assumptions to check it seems important in the first step to begin with themselves, so to make the possibility of designing a different world tangible. This iterative process leads to fresh insights. But the community-based approach not only leads to new insights, but can lead to a higher incidence of fun and joy, and ultimately health and well-being by strengthening group working experiences.\nThe third working group focused on the question: \"How can we increase the societal appreciation for a public welfare oriented social system?\" Also during this idea development and brainstorming process, the need for people to meet in person in \"their\" area, city, country was emphasized. For example, working in interactive groups can lead to an intensification of togetherness and can make prevention and care topic. The supposedly negative connotations otherwise associated with these concepts such as disease, death and a feeling of helplessness are thus transformed. A positive attitude towards the subject is promoted, fears can be reduced, and at the same time the respect and appreciation for the work of nurses and caregivers is increased. In particular, a playful approach to the subject can support this project and convey the idea that all can benefit. Another important aspect for answering the initial question is to explore the current actual situation in care. The question as to why the appreciation in prevention and care sector is so low can lead to valuable information to help find solutions. In prototyping, the motto of \"living appreciation\" was made tangible and concrete: Care and prevention spaces would be established in the middle of society, fulfilling the basic needs of all, which ensures the participation of all so that this approach corresponds to the wishes of all and fulfills their needs. To test this assumption requires a thorough basic research of existing resources, as well as bureaucratic hurdles, and to examine stakeholders, especially those who are not participating.\nBased on the work of the three groups, the following definition of the problems was generated:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Dehumanization of health and social systems \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The focus on treating symptoms rather than promoting healthy lifestyles \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Privatization and capitalization of public goods, which should be accessible to all \nThe concrete solution that the participants collectively devised, states that:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0All we need is there if we work together and share our resources\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0A paradigm shift is needed: \"From Pathogenesis to Salutogenesis\" \u2013 Solidary Health Promotion System with Global Knowledge Network and Local Action Spaces \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Working \"with people for people\" and connect visionaries, experts, institutions and places through concrete actions \nThis solution leads to the following intended:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Employing existing treasures: Mapping for individual and community networking, online and in person, in theory and practice \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Practising appreciation: Create care and prevention spaces in the middle of society to fulfill the basic needs of all and create new incentive/recognition structures in the long term \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Local systemic change: Developing new skills, resources and infrastructure that can be used by all of us: children, young people, adults, seniors (people in all phases of life). \nStrong arguments for the proposal are:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Bottom-up structure with small relatively autonomous systems, who self-regulate the supply and demand of health and social services for individuals and communities \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Only through shared ownership effectiveness and sustainability can this be secured \nOur approaches, technologies and tactics are:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Active participation of ALL leads to a prototype that works for the majority and meets their needs (human-centered development of global platform and local spaces) \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Collective, iterative structure combining theory and practice \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Global Knowledge Network \u2013 CAREPEDIA: bundled knowledge (Internet / platform) all have access to the \"central office\" \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Local Action Spaces: Locally designed and managed spaces for health-promoting coexistence \"From Pathogenesis to Salutogenesis\"\nWe believe our solution will work because: We have existing needs (more than 80% of people want a functional and appreciative system for care and prevention ) and real effects from a dehumanized health and care system. We know many people and institutions that are interested in cooperating and who would gladly contribute their respective expertise. Another world is within reach. There are many projects and movements to prove it. We shall make this even more visible. Everything we need is already there. We need the courage to try it, to experience and live it. We can make an active contribution to this. Financial resources are not a challenge or necessity to achieve this.\nAs expected results \u2013 in the context of existing cases \u2013 we use the following examples: Successful EcoVillages such as Mondragon (a community in the Basque Country without police). Giving spaces, exchange meets and free shops. Micro-agriculture in the city. Urban gardening. Community-supported agriculture creates new relationships between city and land. There are urban farming initiatives in Detroit, critical consumption movements in Italy (GAS), alternative currency systems such as WIR in Switzerland, and solidarity networks for food supply and health clinics in Greece, as well as Networks such as SOLIDAGO and Artabana in Germany. And many more.\nFurthermore, our proposal is confirmed by literature and scientific consensus such as in the field of neuronal research: Fear paralyzes reason and creativity and leads to depression due to stress and alienation . Yet willingness for lifelong learning, creates new neural connections. Further scientific findings such as the Hierarchy of Needs Maslow, the concept of The Ever-Present Origin (Stuttgart 1949-1953) by Jean Gebser, the classic theories of J.M. Baldwin, G.H. Mead, J. Piaget (The Psychology of the Child) and L. Kohlberg as well as related work by C. Gilligan, F. Oser and M. Parsons. Also the literature and research by Ken Wilber, Aurobindo Ghose, Ervin L\u00e1szl\u00f3, Don Beck, and Michael Murphy; \u00a0work on Emotional Intelligence by Daniel Goleman, und the research by Kropotkin, who proved that cooperation is more important than competition in the animal kingdom and is effective for the survival of the group. Also the ample literature on the topics of sustainable lifestyles, Solidarity economy, Holacracy and Sociocracy support our suggested solution.\nHowever, it is necessary to keep sight of the risks. Here there are also a number of examples that could occur either externally or internally: The risk that corporations hijack the ideas and commercialize them, such as happened with Carsharing and CoLiving. External factors such as war, social conflicts, the collapse of the financial system, climate change and its consequences, privatization of public goods such as drinking water, and environmental disasters could endanger our plans.\nBut also our inner monsters, such as greed and the hunger for power \u00a0could torpedo the project. There is always a danger that the idea is not accepted, that the needs of the stakeholders are not met or met only partially; that there are \"too many cooks\" or that the concept can not be implemented due to conflicting priorities, or dependencies between partners and networks arise.\nYet we see possibilities to work against these risks. Reality has proven that it already works, and many people are working toward this aim worldwide:\nWe are many! We cooperate and we are a network. We have sufficient human capacity. Our approach is flexible and can be used in existing structures and institutions. Dependence on existing systems and infrastructures can be solved via an \"open-source\" approach that leads to a multiplying effect, where copying is allowed and actively encouraged.\nThis leads to the reduction of fears, relaxation, deceleration, satisfaction and happiness. There will be systemic relief or elimination of the superfluous, as well as personal and societal development potential through inclusion and the integration of \"fringe groups\" such as unemployed, refugees or marginalized citizens.\nFor evaluation it is intended to study these criteria and assumptions in order to confirm them: Self-organization in groups works. Positions, attitudes and values are part of a common vision. Skills are included and allocated according to an open source principle. The new system or the new platform reaches more people and connects more participants than previous systems or platforms. There are spaces where encounters already take place. Spaces can be created where encounters are possible. Spaces that meet various needs lead to added value for all.\nInterestingly, it can be stated that all three working groups arrived at very similar approaches and ideas, problems and solutions during this intense, exciting and inspiring eight hour workshop: A change of perspective and a paradigm shift is required - instead of focusing on fighting disease, working towards the promotion of health!\nCaroline Paulick-Thiel & Jahn Harrison, nextlearning e.V.\nTranslation: Alexander Paulick-Thiel", "created_at": "2017-05-22 18:19:52", "updated_at": "2017-05-22 18:19:52", "tag_id": 1374, "post_id": 542, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 509}, {"id": 9659, "text": null, "quote": "Can we look at Care as a form of maintenance instead of as an emergency call for chronic issues?

There is a great reason for us to team up and work on the challenge together: Hacking, internet security, and medical devices. He knows a lot about that stuff.\n\u00c9ireann with his friend, Dr. Marie Moe started investigating the security of pacemakers - as Marie's life actually depends on a little instrument that generates each of her heartbeats. And runs\u00a0on a proprietary code.

I think a good example of this is Under 30 Changemakers, which hosts discussions\u00a0and training through google hangouts. Instead of having broad web-chats they pre-choose discussion topics based off of community interests or world events and invite their memebers to bring in their perspective. That way people come in already invested in the topic and feel more connected to the community by interacting with members who share their passions. \u00a0Also, another activity that seems to go well it when people sign up to be matched with another random member for a skype session.

Pelion in Central Greece, two friends have decided to create Village Psy. Our project aims to foster the exchange of knowledge and ideas through an open dialogue and spontaneous experiential expression which gives space for personal development. The main objective of Village Psy is to bring together people who have a common interest in issues related to psychotherapy, personal development, and self-improvement. The whole process goes beyond the format of conferences and seminars in enclosed spaces but integrates elements of the natural environment.\nThere are numerous examples from similar healing events in ancient Greece, such as the Asclepeia showing the importance of nature in healing. Drawing from this inspiration, Village Psy combines experiential workshops, presentations, and parallel events to visitors who are looking to combine their summer holidays with self-development.\nThe people behind the idea\nVillage Psy is an original idea of Dimitris Pantelis and Atalandi Apergi. The initial idea came 3 years ago, in a discussion under an old plane tree in the village of Pinakates. The discussion revolved around how psychotherapy connects with nature, and how this connection could be expanded to benefit more people. This idea has since evolved to a vision which connects two pillars: 1) thematic tourism and 2) making the process sustainable, repeatable and stable over time.\n\u00a0\nAtalandi has a degree in Sociology and is a post-graduate in Text & Performance Studies. She has also completed a 4-year specialized post-graduate training diploma in drama therapy, and further enriched her psychotherapeutic training and experience with seminars in various psychiatric structures. As a drama therapist, she has clinical experience with different populations, including drug addicts, immigrants, abused women, psychiatric patients, the elderly and people with learning disabilities. Atalandi is a member of the European Association of Psychotherapy (EAP), The British Association of Dramatherapists, the Panhellenic Professional Union of Dramatherapists, a member of the editing team of a thematic magazine dealing with drama therapy and a volunteer for WWF-Hellas.\nDimitris studied Economics & Business Administration and has worked for 15 years in the banking and telecommunications sector on public relations, sales, and client service. He then continued with studies in Integrative Counselling & Psychotherapy and training on treatments of multi-cultural communities following natural disasters. Dimitris is a member of the local community council, a member of the Mountaineering Club \u201cPan\u201d and member of the Hellenic Counselling Society.\nThe project runs on the basis of trust and good chemistry between the two founders. The whole concept has been tested in the past through collaboration in smaller scale projects, such as seminars. Their relationship is based on complementarity and mutualism, not rivalries. Driving motivation by their own inspiration, the two of us develop the project locally, being aware of other seminars and educational activities that take place in different places. However, this is the first attempt to connect psychotherapy with nature, while offering access to knowledge stemming from different schools of therapy.\nThe team focuses on facilitation of organizational work -not coaching in the seminars- something that allows them to retrieve various tools and previous experience. On the course of this collaboration, the two founders discovered abilities that even themselves were not aware of. Dimitris is very business savvy, while Atalandi is more into the arts and very protected from all forms of institutionalization. Although we\u2019re different, we have managed to develop \u201cthe same language\u201d and excellent communication, allowing the project to move further.\nVillage Psy is the work of two persons, who are usually busy with other tasks. Atalandi is raising two small children, while Dimitris is preparing for his exams in the Nursing School. During the last months, Village Psy has been occupying nearly half of their everyday lives. Although it is difficult to understand this time commitment, seeing the results allows them to realize that this is a lot of work. According to Atalandi, the whole process entails a risk. \u201cIt is amazing how you begin with an idea and in a few days or weeks, you see it taking off. The more \u00a0you believe in your vision and the more passionate you are about it, the more you can overcome many personal obstacles\u201d. For Dimitris, this project is important because it allowed him to \u201ctrust collaboration again\u201d.\nWho benefits from Village Psy?\nThe target group of the project includes men and women of 25+ years of age, but there is no restriction in terms of age, gender or background. This audience is distributed as follows:\n\n\nGeneral population who is interested in self-improvement.\n \n\nFellow psychologists, counselors of mental health or other professionals, who have finished their studies and are looking to come in contact with different approaches in their professional development.\n \n\nAll those who would like to continue their training in counseling or psychotherapy and wish to be exposed to different schools of psychotherapy. This includes students who want to specialize in something they do not know, who in 8 days can experience nine different approaches in order to arrive at what is the most compatible with their own interests.\n \n\nThe ideal place for Village Psy\nBeyond the personal connection with the village of Pinakates, the inspiration for choosing the location stemmed from the need of a place where people can stay together, ensuring continuity, contact and sharing throughout the process. At Village Psy, everything is done in a\u00a0community, and that is the importance of the word \u201cVillage\u201d.\nIn this context, we are collaborating with local hostels and restaurants and the village\u2019s Cultural Association. Other collaborations involve graphic designers and web developers, although all content is generated by them.\nAt present, the main objective is to get Village Psy established, attracting more and more people in its sessions. However, there are ambitious ideas for similar activities related to alternative and holistic therapy, running in parallel in the surrounding villages, but also the creation of other such respective villages in other areas, so that they can work and connect together. This would allow Village Psy escape its physical boundaries and work towards the creation of a platform for the generation and diffusion of knowledge, always connecting therapy with the landscape and the natural environment.\n\u00a0\nTowards concept validation\nFor this first year (2016) the project runs on experimental mode, under the auspices of Kondyli Publishers (www.kondyli.gr). This is a thematic publisher, owned by Dimitris, which specializes on issues relevant to psychotherapy. There are thoughts to change the legal entity behind Village Psy, and establish a new one, once the concept is tested and running in a way that is sustainable.\nOur project has attracted the attention of the press, with many media publishing press releases, interviews or articles. At the same time, a dedicated website (www.village-psy.gr) and Facebook page (www.facebook.com/villagepsy) includes all information that needs to be transferred to potential beneficiaries.\nThe first session of Village Psy has taken place between 18-28 August in Pinakates, under the theme \u201cCentaur Chiron: Myth - Trauma - Therapy\u201d. The title pays tribute to the mythological figure who roamed the Mountains of Pelion, where Pinakates is located. This first trial offered opportunities for receiving feedback from participants, aiming to improve the process in following sessions. And it resulted in both creation of a very strong community, but also ideas and solutions beyond our imagination.\n\u00a0\nAre you developing different ways of approaching mental health and therapy yourself?

The City Administration regulated the matter for new buildings as well as existing ones. The latter faced a variety of unforeseen problems that resulted into a 10% compliance rate in 15 months since the law passed. In the common understanding, this means a public effort not hitting the target, a cracked relationship between the City Administration and private businesses and ultimately disadvantaged people still vulnerable.\nThe story begins in 2015 with the City of Milan to pass the Building Regulation article 77 that required all bars, shops, restaurants and craft activities bordering the road, to provide easy access to people with limited mobility or disabilities (the National Institute of Statistic in 2007 assessed 13.189 people with mobility disabilities in Milan). This normative action was the instrument that City of Milan deployed to overcome architectural barriers and provide universal free access to public places by 2017.\n\nIn November 2016, 12 month after the law passed the City of Milan assessed only 2.000 businesses compliant over 18.000. An article on la Repubblica, the second most read Italian newspaper, by the 5 January 2017, published these data and opened a public discussion on the subject.\nLisa Noja (delegate of the Major for accessibility policies) said: We have to make sure that very quickly all businesses comply. This year we want to get to the full application of a rule of civilization and to do that you cannot only use repressive strategies.\nIt was a beginning of a twist in the Municipal strategy and the start of a speculation about the most effective way to enforce a regulation. The new thinking included working with trade associations, like Confcommercio, as well as promoting campaigns to engage business holders.\nCristina Tajani (City Councillor for labour policies, businesses, trade and human resources) said: places that show attention to the disabled are also easily accessible to children, parents with strollers and the elderly. This does not mean that they will not be submitted to controls, but we want help the business understand that the adjustment should not only be seen as an obligation. It is also a business opportunity.\nThis is when OpenCare approach came handy. Local staff including WeMake was involved and started talking to as many people as possible, to understand what was not working and tentatively get it streight.\nListening\u00a0it was vital to start from the pieces of the City Administration that were involved from the beginning like the Major Cabinet, the Urbanistic Department, the Public Soil Occupation Office and lately Urban Economy and Work department. We have understood that the building legislation was conceived in a department and the implementing regulation was written in a different one (and of course published through another one). That gave a lot of room to officers for interpretations and tightening the instructions for businesses to prevent opportunistic behaviors. \u00a0\u00a0\nIncluding as the collaboration with the trade association got closed we\u2019ve understood more of the problems that businesses are facing to comply with the regulation, such as: high costs, complex red tape, lack of understanding of the most suitable solution and existing solutions too standardized. Since red tape is partially due to complex implementing regulations and the unclear communication follows, we started facilitating a mutual dialogue between pieces of public administration, businesses and associations. Regarding costs and production related problems, we can take it into the arena of manufacturing 4.0 by including also designers, makers, social innovators, businesses and utilizers.\nGoing where innovation beats\u00a0we have started organizing an experimentation called Open Rampe (Rampe means Ramps/Slides) in a limited area of the city that has everything it takes. The Quartiere Isola in fact has a functioning District for Urban Commerce, a civic center devoted to urban regeneration, art and crafts workshops (ADA stecca), active businesses and a long tradition of civic participation. Our idea is to engage business individually and through a public event by 11th April. Involving them into\u00a0co-design sessions pivoting around their necessities may generate unexpected outcomes.\nDealing with collective intelligence\u00a0is what we have just started doing by sharing this story here. Any input from the community could be brought into our experimentation and add value to it.

If one cannot bring a simple solution to the market because of the iters for safety and quality certification, and this we agree is bad, the solution should not be \"ok, let's ignore this step and bypass it\".\nThere are a number of issues here. 1st and foremost, one has to describe how safety and quality are reasonably assured, and what safety net would be put in place should something still happen (although we know they are not perfect, to use an euphemism, today a number of tools and services exist to cover for assistance, accidents' costs, etc on the side of providers).\nOf course, one could ignore this. Depending on the IP scheme, no safety nets would be needed (although it would nice to think of them), for example. But this brings us to a second issue, one that\u00a0is almost\u00a0\"ethical\": transforming every patient in a maker can leverage the citizen-scientist effect only if (this is presented as\u00a0gut feeling here, but I am open to discuss it in depth later)\u00a0the right IP scheme is adopted. And only if radical openness is adopted one can truly claim no responsibility over the final \"accidents\" that will always happen (only that which does not work, will not break).\u00a0Should the creator preserve control of the IP for itself, one will always find a court that will consider the business model \"exploitative\", and enforce the order to establish the aforementioned safety nets (there is an interesting case about a fire happend in an AirBnB apartment that touches on this topic)... falling back to the problem one wanted to work around, just a bit later.\nSo, what would be the general ecosystem' services that would keep this garden grow orderly? I don't see this answered (that's not an easy one,\u00a0indeed)\nResearch, and \"citizen science\", target the pioneers and early adopters... To scale beyond that, we need to think the entire ecosystem, and be humble.\nFor the sake of our understanding, let me be pedant and allow me to stress that\u00a0disabilities do not exist in silos. People have many things going on in their lives, and around them, of course also the disabled ones. They do not stop living when they change status.\u00a0A few will want to pioneer, some will want to have new solutions, some others will not want any because... I am not sure they need a \"because\".\n\nI would like to not dig too deep in the question about why the current \"solutions\" are often not marketed/offered... just for the sake of reasoning together: if you had a clue about how to build an engine, and it would work once every 100 attempts after serious tinkering... would you be able to market it? Let's be honest with ourselves and remember that researchers are very optimistic people (I belong to the category, so this is self-criticism). They will produce proof of concepts, hardly ever demonstrators (although they usually confuse the terminology), and they don't normally ask themselves questions like \"how long will this work continuously?\", \"what will be the safety mechanism once it turns off, as instance because of battery exhaustion?\", how many scenarios are realistically recapitulated in the lab I used for the tests, and how well does this solution generalize?\",...\nLet's not dive in the argument of healthcare provision on this topic. Sometimes it is the right reflection to face, some other it is populistic... In these circumstances it reminds of the sentence I have recently read on twitter \"being poor means having too much end of the month\"... it may steal a smile, but it's a classic example of ill-posedness.

When ever an adolescent brings up a topic around \u00a0reproductive health or sex \u00a0education, they are usually severely punished \u00a0and regarded as been disrespectful to their elders. Due to this absence of discussion on sex education, many adolescent young girls face lots of challenges and stigma at their puberty stage, especially during menstruation.Most parents in Cameroon especially in the rural and grassroots areas, don't know that they have to provide pads for their girl children during menstruation. They don't even give their girls advice when these children even summon a little courage to inform them that something abnormal is happening with them .According to many parents, these children are very immature and still very young to be able to handle understand and process issues on puberty , reproductive health and menstruation. Because of this lack of discussion between parents and children on sex education, many of these girls, during menstruation are forced to stay away from school because of stigma from boys who often notice blood stains on their uniforms and also the unpleasant odor which \u00a0cames out of the bodies as a result. \u00a0Their staying away from school, makes them not to be performant as they ought to be like the boys and this plays a key role for their poor performances. Some stay away for two weeks and others for a month, just to avoid this stigma. As a youth advocate to encourage parent children dialogue on sex education and advoacting for Access to reproductive health knowledge, i have had time to hold some trainings with a few groups of adolescent girls to tell me about their experiences. \u00a0As a result of lack of menstrual hygiene, due to absence of \u00a0dialogue between them and their parents, \u00a0i was amazed by the stories i got. Some said, as they approached their parents \u00a0when\u00a0they noticed boold stains on their pants, they were thoroughly scolded and driven away and warned never to discuss any thing on menstruation. Some said, they were forced to carry dry dust and sand to\u00a0insert into their vaginas in order to stop the bleeding as they knew not what was happening to them. Other stories came up like using \u00a0dirty clothes to pad themselves, which was very in hygienic and gave them some genital infections. \u00a0As a result of this lack of knowledge on reproductive health for adolescent girls, many have dropped out of school because of unintended pregnancies, some have contracted sexually transmissable infections and others have been forced into early marriages , to the boys that impregnated them. Many of these \u00a0adolecents have lost hope for a better future, because they are now in condtions due to necglect and lack of reproductive health knowledge. \u00a0so i am hoping to enlightened parents and the community about the importance of sex education and also advocating for this curriculum to be taught in primary and secondary schools in Cameroon. I am hoping, to equally train these adolescent girls on matters of gender equality, menstrual hygiene , family planning and reproductive health as a Whole. In Africa, there is an ardage which says \"Charity begins at home\" if \u00a0discussions between parents and children are initiated at home on sex education, it will go an extra mile to enable parents understand their daughters and support them effectively , so that they will not be statistics of unwanted pregnancies , school drop outs and poor academic performance in school. If Access to knowledge on reproductive health is improved upon \u00a0for parents and adolescent girls, then sustainable development will be ensured.

A great project by Jonas Rylander which we find very inspiring for our design challenge you can read about in the following post.\nWhat are the expectations about the use of public spaces when it comes to cooking on the street?\nEven tough I already put up a short r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of our research phase here, now follows the detailed version to allow an even better understanding for everyone interested. Also we would like to share the other surprising insights we have gained so far. Maybe they are helpful to one or the other and maybe some of you would like to contribute. What are your thoughts on and what is your interpretation of all this? We would be very thankful for any comments!\nTo first introduce us: We are a group of 4 university students from Berlin, three product designers and one socio economic communication designer and call ourselves \u201cA Taste of Home\u201d. How we came up with the name and the following design question, I will tell below:\n\u201cHow can we help newcomers to use public spaces to their full extend because they do not know which activities are legal in these spaces and do not want to act against the law?\u201d\nTwo month ago we went into the field asking ourselves \u201cHow can food preparation contribute to make people on the move feel at home and include other people living in this \u201cforeign\u201d country?\u201d Amongst others we ended up talking to one 24 year-old guy from Syria and one girl from Korea about the same age. One had to flee home and the other moved for love.\nBoth of them are living in a caring environment. One in a shared flat with wonderful people (\u201clocals\u201d) who are all very closed to each other and the other together with her boyfriend who originally is from Germany. After having found out about this we dropped the second half of our starting question \u201c[\u2026] and include other people living in this \u201cforeign\u201d country?\u201d , because we did not see this need anymore. They are already sharing their everyday life with \u201clocals\u201d, therefore also cooking with them. At least in this context one could say, they are well integrated. This left us with \u201cHow can food preparation contribute to make people on the move feel at home?\u201d\nIn terms of food culture we found out that it is mostly about eating as an occasion. It\u2019s about the taste, but even more about the surrounding atmosphere. The Syrian guy once got invited to the home of a Syrian family also living in Berlin for dinner. The food was \u201cyummy\u201d and \u201cIt tasted, just like it does when my mom cooks.\u201d, but what he enjoyed even more were the conversations, the way things were handled around the table. The two little boys of the family were fighting over the remote control just like he and his siblings used to do back home. There was a lot of fooling around which not just he but everyone enjoyed.\nBoth the Syrian guy and the Korean girl are still cooking dishes they know from back home, even though it never tastes as good as it does when their moms cook. They both said that they left home to early to develop great cooking skills and learn all the tricks. In Korea traditionally a woman would only start cooking by herself after her marriage. Nowadays a lot of young people are leaving the country, respectively their parents\u2019 homes, not being married and therefore without the entire knowledge. But as said before, they are both still trying and sometimes calling their mothers to ask for help. The Korean girl once even tried to sign up for a traditional Korean cooking class to improve her skills but unfortunately it was immediately booked up. Since then she has been hoping for a new opportunity. It seems that missing the food one grew up with is a good motivation to become active. Good food triggers people to do something. It is important to put the emphasis on the word something, because both of the interviewees recognized that it is also the missing time, which keeps them from cooking all the recipes they used to love back home. Some just take too much time in preparation: \u201cMaybe 4 to 5 hours.\u201d, the Syrian guy told us. Having to divide their time between work, German classes, socialising and cooking most of the days they are not willing to spent these many hours on the latter.\nBefore going on and explaining how we reshaped our design question with this knowledge in mind, I would like to share one more surprising insight we gained through the two interviews.\nTalking about food and well being the Syrian guy told us that when he had just arrived to Germany, he did not like to eat outside. It disgusted him. Not being able to see the food preparation made him feel uncomfortable. We tried to find out the reason for this, whether it was because he eats Halal, which he does or it was out of cleanliness concerns, but yet could not manage to do so. We still have to ask again. What happened here shows one of the difficulties we had conducting the interviews. The question triggered some awkwardness. This we felt, but why we were not able to tell. Was it because the subject was sensitive to the respondent and his eating customs? Was it because he did want to offend us since we were talking about German food? How can we overcome such awkwardness whenever it occurs in future interviews?\nTo go on with the process of our research I would first like to recall the reshaped design question: \u201cHow can food preparation contribute to make people on the move feel at home?\u201d It still seemed like the question was to broad to be solved in one design project. This is why we changed the target group \u201cpeople on the move\u201d to \u201cyoung migrants\u201d (20-30 years of age). We felt that the latter was more suitable for coming up with a specific design and the people we had interviewed both fit in this category. We then went back to synthesising the interviews once more and found that they were totally worth a second look. There was this whole topic of interactive food customs and traditions we yet had not paid enough attention to.\nReviewing our notes we got to understand, that for the people we had talked to \u201cfeeling at home\u201d in the context of food culture was a lot about the interactive customs and traditions which they had been surrounded by most of their lives. The Syrian guy misses the Syrian nights where as he tells everyone takes their coaches and pillows outside, drinks tea, smokes, chats and just sleeps on the streets. He told us, that this maybe does not happen in bigger towns but in villages as in smaller or medium-sized towns it does.\nThe girl told us that she is missing the Korean street food a lot. Once she tried out a Korean street food market here in Berlin, but did not like it. She went there with some friends. They wanted to have some good Korean food, chat and meet new people. It turned out to be a disappointment. It was too expensive \u2013 there was even an entrance fee \u2013 and the food was just not good. In Korea she always used to eat outside with her friends. Cooking was a family thing; eating out was for all other social events. Considering these stories it made sense to rephrase or specify our question to: \u201cHow can we enable young migrants to integrate interactive food customs / traditions they like and bring from their cultures of origin into Berlin\u2019s community life?\u201d Furthermore it was then that we came up with our group name \u201cA Taste of Home\u201d.\nIt finally was the comment of a fellow student, which led us to modify our topic to what it is about now. She told us about an interview her group conducted with three Syrian refugees. During their conversation the interviewees mentioned the huge summer barbecues they always would have had back in Syria: a lot of friends, family, a lot of food, somewhere in the nature, in a park. Having been asked if they are organising similar activities here in summertime, they denied. They thought that in Berlin it was forbidden to have a barbecue anywhere outside and did not want to act against the law seen their uncertain statuses. Still they miss them. It was this story which made us change the question to: \u201cHow can we help newcomers to use public spaces to their full extend because they do not know which activities are legal in these spaces and do not want to act against the law?\u201d\nThis question has to be considered on different levels. The higher-level question is: \u201cHow to harmonize the expectations about how to use public spaces?\u201d What do \u201cnewcomers\u201d, what do \u201clocals\u201d, what does everyone using those places want and how can the once being mutually exclusive to each other being handled? The second level is the topic of cooking on the street. Where, how and in which contexts is cooking in public spaces wanted? And last but not least the design challenge is about getting to know the legal frame and making it graspable for everyone.\nAll this is related to the fact, that there are a lot of refugees staying in camps where they do not have any opportunity to cook at all or even if they receive \u201cfood money\u201d instead of catering, they only have access to a shared kitchen. Another guy from Syria we cooked with lives in such a place. He told us, that the huge number of people who are sharing the kitchen there is often keeping him away from cooking. Though some of his friends who are living in another camp without cooking facilities sometimes join him for cooking. How can we enable them to make cooking a regular part of their lives again?", "created_at": "2017-04-15 19:34:14", "updated_at": "2017-04-15 19:34:14", "tag_id": 1395, "post_id": 506, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 473}, {"id": 9755, "text": null, "quote": "Hey @Noemi, this is just something cultural that people have always been doing in\u00a0Morocco, it's about going out to catch the cool breeze after a hot summer day and of couse cook together...however there has been a change in the policy in the last couple of years, and it is\u00a0not allowed to cook in public parks any more even though they use\u00a0a traditional\u00a0portable clay pot for coal/making fire and there is no hasard in cooking open air in such way...\nWhen people go to the countryside for weekends/holidays, they always take the clay pots to cook their own food in the nature...even though there are restaurants available everywhere.", "created_at": "2017-04-15 19:37:41", "updated_at": "2017-04-15 19:37:41", "tag_id": 1395, "post_id": 18382, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 473}, {"id": 9756, "text": null, "quote": "in Greece, many solidarity groups the last years have been cooking on the street for homeless or refugees.

Voici notre proposition:\u00a0\nUne nouvelle Maison du Peuple!\nAujourd\u2019hui est un jour historique pour Bruxelles. Apr\u00e8s de longs mois d\u2019incertitude, le conseil communal \u00e0 enfin tranch\u00e9: le Palais de la Bourse deviendra le lieu commun de tous les bruxellois. Ils ont \u00e0 nouveau une Maison du Peuple!\nCe temple architectural est \u00e9videmment d\u2019abord un choix symbolique. Apr\u00e8s y avoir accept\u00e9 la tr\u00e8s controvers\u00e9e exposition Behind The Numbers glorifiant le n\u00e9o-liberalisme, la Ville s\u2019est rendue compte qu\u2019il fallait donner une autre destination \u00e0 cet endroit que celle de pure sp\u00e9culation commerciale et d'activit\u00e9 touristique. En transformant une partie de la Bourse en Maison du Peuple elle redonne une place aux Bruxellois au c\u0153ur du centre historique!\nDonnez la ville aux habitants, et tout le monde s\u2019en portera mieux\nOn ne comptait plus le nombre d\u2019actions contre les plans de la Ville: plates-formes citoyennes, regroupements de commer\u00e7ants, actions ludiques diverses... Qui ne se souvient du banc de 30 m d\u00e9pos\u00e9 au milieu de la Grand place, ou des centaines de gens pique-niquant place de la Bourse, de l'action de revendication des escaliers de la Bourse comme tribune libre d'expression politique lors du KunstenFestivaldesarts? L\u2019espace public \u00e9tait devenu un haut lieu de d\u00e9bat, mais paradoxalement ne recevait pas d\u2019endroit ad\u00e9quat pour le mener (une Agora). La participation ne remuait que du vent, les riverains ne se sentaient pas entendus. La ville \u00e9tait taill\u00e9e sur mesure pour les eurocrates, les touristes Chinois, avec commerces ouverts le dimanche, tandis que le Bruxellois devait se contenter d\u2019une ville certes prestigieuse, mais sans lieu o\u00f9 il fait bon vivre, une ville d'exp\u00e9riences individuelles juxtapos\u00e9es, atomis\u00e9es, sans liens.\nLe Beer Tempel projet\u00e9 dans le Palais de la Bourse aura une entr\u00e9e par l\u2019arri\u00e8re, et c'est tr\u00e8s bien ainsi. Mais sans occuper tout l'espace, il comprendra une nouvelle Maison du Peuple, o\u00f9 chacun pourrait d\u00e9battre de ce qui se passe dans la ville, o\u00f9 les initiatives bottom-up pourront cro\u00eetre, de nouvelles id\u00e9es pour une ville meilleure surgir. Il importe de faire de ce lieu symbolique qu'est la Bourse un espace de libre d\u00e9bat, une Agora. Il s'agit de rendre la ville aux habitants pour que tout le monde en profite, pour que l\u2019habitant s\u2019y sente bien. Alors le touriste, le commer\u00e7ant et tout les autres s'y sentiront bien aussi.\nLa Ville esp\u00e8re avec cette Maison du Peuple calmer les tensions palpables par le biais d\u2019une communication plus ouverte: un endroit de rencontre et d\u2019\u00e9coute sera ainsi am\u00e9nag\u00e9 dans le b\u00e2timent. En revitalisant de cette fa\u00e7on la Bourse, en lui donnant une \u00e9chelle humaine, la Ville aide \u00e0 fabriquer le tissu social des prochaines d\u00e9cennies. Bien s\u00fbr, le touriste y aura sa place, car la Maison du peuple sera ouverte a tous. Mais nous ne voulons pas que la centralit\u00e9 habit\u00e9e soit confisqu\u00e9e par une vitrine \u00e0 touristes. A la Maison du Peuple, les touristes pourraient rencontrer des Bruxellois, trouver des bons plans pour une visite de Bruxelles vue par ses habitants, trouver le plaisir culturel de ville plus qu'une consommation gr\u00e9gaire.\nUtopie et R\u00e9alit\u00e9? \nEt maintenant vient la chute: on est encore bien loin de cette possible utopie \u00e0 Bruxelles et c\u2019est bien dommage.

In one project taking place at the lab, members are engineering yeast to express milk proteins from non-animal sources - next generation of vegan cheeses and milk. Others are busy developing an eco-friendly bacterial sunscreen.\nOpen Insulin is one of these projects, and its goal is to make it simpler and less expensive to make insulin, starting by investigating some novel ideas for making insulin in e. coli using fewer, easier steps than in common industrial protocols. If successful, the members hope it can be a step towards making generic production more economical, and might also enable more participation in research related to insulin, or production of the medicine at smaller scale, closer to the patients who need it, further reducing costs and giving access to more patients who lack it.\nCounter Culture Labs was founded by a group of hackers with diverse backgrounds and interests in the period from 2011 to 2012, with some members coming from Sudo Room, another hackerspace in Oakland that I participated in founding. Many were also involved in Occupy Oakland, and wanted to establish a more permanent organization with the same community spirit and values. Other members came from Biocurious, another biohacking space in Sunnyvale, in the southern end of the Bay Area. I became involved both because I shared the desire to build a community-focused institution, and because I have diabetes type 1 myself, which means I live with the frustration of costly and tedious treatment regimens day in and day out, and I know how much the standard of care for diabetes patients lags behind what recent research suggests might be possible. So, for my own sake, and for the sake of the others with the condition, I sought to take whatever steps I could to close the gap between the research and what is available to patients on the market right now.\nAbout a year ago, some long-standing discussions around making a bioreactor to produce insulin, which had inspired a few previous attempts, turned more concrete when Isaac Yonemoto, another independent researcher of medical treatments, made some suggestions to us about interesting possibilities for innovation and improvement in existing protocols. We started organising regular meetings, and out of those we then organized a successful crowdfunding campaign, which then opened up connections to professionals who work on various aspects of the problem, both the science and engineering around insulin, and the questions of access to medicine. Through this it came to our attention that access to insulin lags far behind the need even now, and even in the most developed countries - costs of insulin are prohibitive even to many people in the US - and all in all, roughly 50% of those in the world who require it have no access to insulin at all, according to the 100 Campaign, a group working on improving access to insulin around the world. There is almost no generic insulin on the American market at the moment - the first one appeared on the market about two weeks after we finished our crowdfunding campaign last year, but it is a long acting type, which is only part of the therapy required by people with diabetes type 1 (about 15-20% of diabetics in USA have type 1; the rest have type 2). And for those who use an insulin pump, short acting insulin is necessary.\nThe general problem in the first world is that the incentives and interests of producers and patient communities are not aligned.\nRight now we\u2019re focused on achieving the first scientific milestones, which is to produce proinsulin, the precursor of the active form of insulin, in e. coli, in our small-scale community lab. Our lab runs mostly on donated and salvaged equipment and reagents and might be comparable in its capabilities to a lab in a less-developed area of the world where there is the least access to insulin. If we succeed, it would show the possibility that small-scale producers in remote areas might be able to make insulin to satisfy local demand, in places where centrally-manufactured supplies can\u2019t reach due to lack of infrastructure - where what roads there are, if any, do not let refrigerated trucks pass to ship needed pharmaceuticals in. Once we have a protocol that embraces everything from production to purification to near the level of purity of pharmaceutical grade insulin, we plan to approach established generics manufacturers with a case for the economic feasibility of serving the unserved market for insulin, and to partner with them to do the rest of the work of achieving sufficient purity of the product and scaling the methods to production. As we proceed with our work, the main batch of patents around the various forms of insulin are expiring, which will further help us make the case for a comprehensive portfolio of treatments to potential generics manufacturers.\nProvided all this goes well, we might then pursue another idea, closer to our original hope of a bioreactor that produces insulin, and a kind of \u2018holy grail\u2019 goal in the DIY bio world, which is a desktop biofactory, an analog of desktop 3D printers, but for proteins and biologics, which we might develop to first execute one of our protocols to produce insulin, but which we might also design with more flexibility in mind. This would consist of a bioreactor portion that could grow a culture of e. coli or yeast, and then extract and purify a product from it - very roughly speaking, the union of a fermenter with an FPLC, a piece of equipment that purifies proteins. If that is possible, supply of insulin could be placed very close to the demand of the diabetics around the world in a simple, economical package, and reliance on distribution infrastructure would be minimized. It would also reduce the need to have skilled technicians with years of lab experience to execute these protocols by hand.\nUltimately, I hope that opening up the tools for research to more people can help to bring research on cures to patients, and not just treatments. Let me mention a few of the more promising ideas that have had some success in research settings. One approach is to implant functioning pancreatic cells from a donor and protect them from immune attack by various means - hard to scale if you need a constant supply of donors,but it might be possible to grow cultures of the cells in vitro to address this. Another approach is to get the immune system to cease its attack on pancreatic cells, and promote the regrowth of the body\u2019s own insulin-producing cells, either in the pancreas, or in another tissue via gene therapy - a simpler approach to apply once it is developed. Some of the ideas use very inexpensive supplies such as adjuvants, the materials in vaccines that provoke an immune response - and there has been some success using adjuvants alone, or with carefully chosen additions, to get the bodies of diabetic patients to reduce or cease their autoimmune attacks. Other concepts address the metabolic changes behind type 2 diabetes. Several drugs between the research and commercial worlds of medicine can act directly on the metabolic control mechanisms of the body, changing its pattern of energy use and other aspects of metabolism back from the pathological state of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes to the normal, healthy base state. Some of them are small organic molecules, easier to make than proteins such as insulin, but due in part to reasons of cost and incumbency, are not mainstream treatments yet.\nAt the most general level, what we seek to prove is that if an order of magnitude more people get involved in research and development of science and technology, medicine can progress much faster, and might no longer be held back by institutional constraints and perverse incentives in the economics of the institutions. Right now, we\u2019re a group about half a dozen people working regularly on the project, with a few dozen more people in touch every now and then to help out, and a hundred or two in the extended community, ready to answer a question or call for help. Every week or two, someone new comes to the group, who just learned about the project via the media or our regular meetups, and wants to help. Some are complete beginners and end up taking our introductory classes to biohacking, some already have experience but got tired of the limits of the institutions where they worked, or have relatives with diabetes and want to contribute to progress. Though we\u2019re building up a broader community of participation in research slowly, we hope our efforts can plant many seeds out of which future innovations will grow.\nMeanwhile, we are looking to broaden a circle of people who can advise us, experienced scientists and engineers who can help us troubleshoot issues that inevitably come up when investigating the unknown, but we also hope to inspire other groups to work independently in a broader community of innovation. We would like to set up a network of both institutional and DIY researchers living all around the world who have different approaches and ways of making insulin as well as tackling other diabetes and health related issues. Beyond producing drugs, participants might research questions of access to medicine, investigate what patient communities need the most, look at academic publications to identify the most promising research that is not making it out to serve patients, or help establish the effort to build the desktop biofactory. Part of our goal is to prove it\u2019s possible and worthwhile for people outside institutions to take the initiative on these questions, and inspire others to take the lead in their own efforts and bring about the broader changes we seek.\nDo you have any projects in health, medicine, or biohacking that you\u2019d like to work on, but lack people, knowledge, or resources to make it happen? Are you working on a diabetes-related solution? Or do you feel like a network of care biohackers is something you\u2019d like to get involved with?

I'm not suggesting open source is more reliable, or the only way to go with medical devices. However, there is an issue of transparency of the code to the patient, that has 'similar' issues to the issues of open source.\nOn your other points though, you rightly note that there is a lot of safety and regulation around medical devices. However, we still know that user input issues pervade the safety of medical devices. For examples, see the paper Preventing Medication Errors by \u00a0P Aspden, J Wolcott, J L Bootman, L R Cronenwett:, or any of a number of papers by Harold Thimbleby. The paper Killed by Code written by Sandler et al, also details many case studies that you might be interested in. Getting back to the point about safety regulation, I don't believe that safety regulation takes security into account as regularly. This istarting to happen, but very slowly. This is why the paper \"Pacemakers and implantable cardiac defibrillators: Software radio attacks and zero-power defenses\" is so powerful. They took an FDA certified device, and showed it was possible to make it operate unsafely after some security analysis.\nThere are many more things we might discuss about regulation, such as the FDA's limited resources for looking at the code of the devices. However, there are some good things too, such as the MAUDE database. http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfMAUDE/search.CFM\nBy making this database available, we can search for adverse events and study this in an evidence based approach, as you rightly request.

Collected data can be applied to a various range of fields.\u00a0\nreHub is an interface of interaction man-machine. It can be used in various areas for example the evaluation of dexterity, sport, music & gaming.\nOur beneficiaries are all those people who needs to have an experience feedback concerning the hand movements.\nreHub glove is a tool designed for proprioceptive rehabilitation, to recover movement fluidity after an injury: provided by the physiotherapist, it allows the patient to record and report exercises data such as hand position, finger flexion and fingertips pressure. Recorded data are displayed through a software that reproduces a 3D hand, its movements and detected values. Through the software a physiotherapist is able to evaluate the therapeutic process and possibly change it. Thanks to reHub exercises can be done in physiotherapist presence or at a distance.\nReHub acquires informations about fingers movements from flex and pressure sensors. It uses a 6DOF sensor to define the position of the hand in space.\nreHub glove is the result of a meeting between electronics enthusiasts, a physical therapist and a hand rehabilitation patient to find a way to solve the problem of monitoring the progress during rehabilitation therapy. During this meeting we found out there are no digital devices to monitor the hand rehabilitation and we decided to develop one.\u00a0\nTo define our project we didn\u2019t started from a theoretical concept. We started to make the prototype and to test it.\u00a0\nThe development of reHub working prototype has been at the heart of our design process.\nAs described on www.rehub.pro, the definition of the prototype is subdivided into 4 time frames of research and development. The first steps of the team have moved in electronics and design.\nAfter testing the very first glove we decided to create an integrated system with a self-produced/maker pcb. Our design has always been oriented, and always will be, to integrate all electronics on the top of the glove. Another aspect of our prototype is that the glove itself must be comfortable for the patient. At a later time, once we knew that the glove was able to transmit data to the computer, we focused on the development of a software allowing patients and physiotherapists to evaluate the glove\u2019s collected data through a graphical interface and cartesian charts.\nWe are looking for our final user(s), who will try our product and help us develop different options:\n\nSport\nGaming\nEducational\nMedical \u00a0\n\nWe want to built a community and start a business strategy.\nWe will publish tutorials, kits and software to make your glove.\nEverything to improve the glove solution.\nWe want to develop 4 different kits to sell:\n\nwith single sensors\u00a0\nonly the electronics\nglove tailored\ncomplete of all\n components\n\nWebsites & Social\nwww.rehub.pro\nwww.facebook.com/rehubglove", "created_at": "2017-05-22 19:11:41", "updated_at": "2017-05-22 19:11:41", "tag_id": 1427, "post_id": 33751, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 6600}, {"id": 9847, "text": null, "quote": "Sara: \u201cThere is much work to do including working with actual users and receiving their feedback.

They also grew up in the East of the Netherlands, in two separate small villages. Both were born in 1936 as the younger ones in large Catholic families. My father has in total thirteen brothers and sisters, my mother has eight. So we are speaking of 23 people, including my parents. All of them, except for one uncle who was suffering from mental illnesses and stayed single, married with a Catholic partner.\u00a0 Only one of them divorced, all the other marriages have sustained until today.\nFor my parents and their brother & sisters it was out of the question to marry a person who was not Catholic. However, I never got the idea that my parents were raised in a very strict manner. It could be that some uncles or aunts fell in love with a boy or girl they weren\u2019t allowed to marry but I have never heard anything that indicates that these things happened. Somehow, the idea that you could only marry a person with the same religious background was incorporated as a normal fact of life in my family.\nWhen I was born, secularisation and the removal of traditional religious and socio-political barriers in the Netherlands were well on their way. I still was baptized, sent to a Catholic primary school, but religion was no longer part of the lives of my parents. By the time I was old enough to date with boys, there were absolute no issues about religious backgrounds.\nIn 1986 I went to Amsterdam to study, among others, Political Science. And shortly after that I started to live together with the guy I would marry in 1995. Before our marriage we already bought our first house (1992) en in 1997 we started to build our second house. In 1998 our first daughter was born, followed by a second daughter in 2000. In 1995 I was appointed as CFO of a small retail bank, which my parents considered as quite a achievement as they themselves were blue collar workers with no more than primary education.\nFor me however, being 37 years old, it was the moment where I really started thinking about my life. I outgrew my parents in terms of education and career but did I really do what I wanted to do. What did I do with the ideas I had when starting to study political science? And what about my marriage, was I really living the life I wanted or was it just a matter of doing the things I ought to do, influenced by societal conventions.\nTwo years later I was divorced, gave up my job as a CFO and headed back to Amsterdam. I was totally okay with the idea of being single and when thinking about a new relationship, I always imagined that it would be with a male approximately\u00a0 the same age I was and with a regular career. But totally out of the blue I fell in love with a 12 year young woman, still studying at the university. \u00a0She had been in love with women before. For me it was a big surprise to be in love with a woman. But I quickly got used to the idea. I also had to get used to the idea of having a relationship with someone so much younger. The thing that puzzled me most however, was the idea of how \u00f1she as a young woman could fell in love with me, a middle aged woman.\nSuddenly the idea struck me that I unconsciously considered myself as an acceptable partner for a middle age male but not acceptable for a younger female. That was really funny, because in any relationship I would be the same person. And then I realized how preconditioned we are in any choice we make.\nI am married to her now, she gave birth to our son in 2011. And my daughters are very happy with my partner and their little brother. And my family, including all those highly aged uncles and aunts are totally fine with my family situation. It is amazing what has changed in the past 40 years. People can adapt very easily is my personal experience. But we have to tell stories like this to people to make them realize what is possible. This is very important\nThat brings me to one last story I want to tell in this mission. I always had the idea that in the 16th century, when The Reformation took place, that people were highly religious. And that the barriers between the Catholic and the Protestant communities which were so profound\u00a0 in the lives of my parents was a consequence of choices made by those communities themselves. I found out that most people in the 16th century, by the time all the battles were settled, were really very indifferent about religion.\nThis was also the case for the new regents who were going to govern the Dutch Republic from the year 1581 and further on. Especially their leader, William of Orange, was very tolerant about religion. However he couldn\u2019t convince his fellows to build a society with total freedom of religion and without any government interference in this domain. The dominant view at the time was that people could only by governed by having a dominant state religion and the fear for God as the ultimate instrument to let people behave in a way that was good for society. So the regents made an agreement that, whatever their personal beliefs were, they would act as if they were really very religious and in favour of the Protestant religion. After some years fiction became reality and people took their religion very serious.\u00a0 And almost 400 years later people were still marrying only within their own religious community.\nAgain, the stories we tell each other are very important. If our dominant view is that people are selfish, most people will behave selfish. But in our lives we see so many examples of people behaving otherwise. Especially now this is happening; due to internet and new technologies we see many new forms of voluntary cooperation among people. We have to emphasize this new form of cooperation.

That makes is even more startling that my parents and their brothers & sisters all structured their lifes , including something so private as the choice for a partner in life, within the boundaries of what their religion prescribes. It is not like in Italy that everybody was catholic. There were also lots of protestants families living in the same villages. They knew each other very well, but they didn't live together. And from a certain point of view it worked very well, the communities were living peacefully next to each other for hundred of years. Sure, after the Reformation took place the protestant religion was the only religion which was accepted and the catholics had to go underground. But even that worked out pretty well because no one was bothering them. From a societal point of view the Dutch did very well in being so tolerant. On the other hand, the decisions of the regents at the end of the 16th century very much affected the lifes of individuals even almost 400 years later.\u00a0And when you think about the crisis in our current economic system, we have to remember that most of the current system is based on financial innovations which were done in the beginning of the 17th century.

They also grew up in the East of the Netherlands, in two separate small villages. Both were born in 1936 as the younger ones in large Catholic families. My father has in total thirteen brothers and sisters, my mother has eight. So we are speaking of 23 people, including my parents. All of them, except for one uncle who was suffering from mental illnesses and stayed single, married with a Catholic partner.\u00a0 Only one of them divorced, all the other marriages have sustained until today.\nFor my parents and their brother & sisters it was out of the question to marry a person who was not Catholic. However, I never got the idea that my parents were raised in a very strict manner. It could be that some uncles or aunts fell in love with a boy or girl they weren\u2019t allowed to marry but I have never heard anything that indicates that these things happened. Somehow, the idea that you could only marry a person with the same religious background was incorporated as a normal fact of life in my family.\nWhen I was born, secularisation and the removal of traditional religious and socio-political barriers in the Netherlands were well on their way. I still was baptized, sent to a Catholic primary school, but religion was no longer part of the lives of my parents. By the time I was old enough to date with boys, there were absolute no issues about religious backgrounds.\nIn 1986 I went to Amsterdam to study, among others, Political Science. And shortly after that I started to live together with the guy I would marry in 1995. Before our marriage we already bought our first house (1992) en in 1997 we started to build our second house. In 1998 our first daughter was born, followed by a second daughter in 2000. In 1995 I was appointed as CFO of a small retail bank, which my parents considered as quite a achievement as they themselves were blue collar workers with no more than primary education.\nFor me however, being 37 years old, it was the moment where I really started thinking about my life. I outgrew my parents in terms of education and career but did I really do what I wanted to do. What did I do with the ideas I had when starting to study political science? And what about my marriage, was I really living the life I wanted or was it just a matter of doing the things I ought to do, influenced by societal conventions.\nTwo years later I was divorced, gave up my job as a CFO and headed back to Amsterdam. I was totally okay with the idea of being single and when thinking about a new relationship, I always imagined that it would be with a male approximately\u00a0 the same age I was and with a regular career. But totally out of the blue I fell in love with a 12 year young woman, still studying at the university. \u00a0She had been in love with women before. For me it was a big surprise to be in love with a woman. But I quickly got used to the idea. I also had to get used to the idea of having a relationship with someone so much younger. The thing that puzzled me most however, was the idea of how \u00f1she as a young woman could fell in love with me, a middle aged woman.\nSuddenly the idea struck me that I unconsciously considered myself as an acceptable partner for a middle age male but not acceptable for a younger female. That was really funny, because in any relationship I would be the same person. And then I realized how preconditioned we are in any choice we make.\nI am married to her now, she gave birth to our son in 2011. And my daughters are very happy with my partner and their little brother. And my family, including all those highly aged uncles and aunts are totally fine with my family situation. It is amazing what has changed in the past 40 years. People can adapt very easily is my personal experience. But we have to tell stories like this to people to make them realize what is possible. This is very important\nThat brings me to one last story I want to tell in this mission. I always had the idea that in the 16th century, when The Reformation took place, that people were highly religious. And that the barriers between the Catholic and the Protestant communities which were so profound\u00a0 in the lives of my parents was a consequence of choices made by those communities themselves. I found out that most people in the 16th century, by the time all the battles were settled, were really very indifferent about religion.\nThis was also the case for the new regents who were going to govern the Dutch Republic from the year 1581 and further on. Especially their leader, William of Orange, was very tolerant about religion. However he couldn\u2019t convince his fellows to build a society with total freedom of religion and without any government interference in this domain. The dominant view at the time was that people could only by governed by having a dominant state religion and the fear for God as the ultimate instrument to let people behave in a way that was good for society. So the regents made an agreement that, whatever their personal beliefs were, they would act as if they were really very religious and in favour of the Protestant religion. After some years fiction became reality and people took their religion very serious.\u00a0 And almost 400 years later people were still marrying only within their own religious community.\nAgain, the stories we tell each other are very important. If our dominant view is that people are selfish, most people will behave selfish. But in our lives we see so many examples of people behaving otherwise. Especially now this is happening; due to internet and new technologies we see many new forms of voluntary cooperation among people. We have to emphasize this new form of cooperation.

I think a good example of this is Under 30 Changemakers, which hosts discussions\u00a0and training through google hangouts. Instead of having broad web-chats they pre-choose discussion topics based off of community interests or world events and invite their memebers to bring in their perspective. That way people come in already invested in the topic and feel more connected to the community by interacting with members who share their passions. \u00a0Also, another activity that seems to go well it when people sign up to be matched with another random member for a skype session.

When ever an adolescent brings up a topic around \u00a0reproductive health or sex \u00a0education, they are usually severely punished \u00a0and regarded as been disrespectful to their elders. Due to this absence of discussion on sex education, many adolescent young girls face lots of challenges and stigma at their puberty stage, especially during menstruation.Most parents in Cameroon especially in the rural and grassroots areas, don't know that they have to provide pads for their girl children during menstruation. They don't even give their girls advice when these children even summon a little courage to inform them that something abnormal is happening with them .According to many parents, these children are very immature and still very young to be able to handle understand and process issues on puberty , reproductive health and menstruation. Because of this lack of discussion between parents and children on sex education, many of these girls, during menstruation are forced to stay away from school because of stigma from boys who often notice blood stains on their uniforms and also the unpleasant odor which \u00a0cames out of the bodies as a result. \u00a0Their staying away from school, makes them not to be performant as they ought to be like the boys and this plays a key role for their poor performances. Some stay away for two weeks and others for a month, just to avoid this stigma. As a youth advocate to encourage parent children dialogue on sex education and advoacting for Access to reproductive health knowledge, i have had time to hold some trainings with a few groups of adolescent girls to tell me about their experiences. \u00a0As a result of lack of menstrual hygiene, due to absence of \u00a0dialogue between them and their parents, \u00a0i was amazed by the stories i got. Some said, as they approached their parents \u00a0when\u00a0they noticed boold stains on their pants, they were thoroughly scolded and driven away and warned never to discuss any thing on menstruation. Some said, they were forced to carry dry dust and sand to\u00a0insert into their vaginas in order to stop the bleeding as they knew not what was happening to them. Other stories came up like using \u00a0dirty clothes to pad themselves, which was very in hygienic and gave them some genital infections. \u00a0As a result of this lack of knowledge on reproductive health for adolescent girls, many have dropped out of school because of unintended pregnancies, some have contracted sexually transmissable infections and others have been forced into early marriages , to the boys that impregnated them. Many of these \u00a0adolecents have lost hope for a better future, because they are now in condtions due to necglect and lack of reproductive health knowledge. \u00a0so i am hoping to enlightened parents and the community about the importance of sex education and also advocating for this curriculum to be taught in primary and secondary schools in Cameroon. I am hoping, to equally train these adolescent girls on matters of gender equality, menstrual hygiene , family planning and reproductive health as a Whole. In Africa, there is an ardage which says \"Charity begins at home\" if \u00a0discussions between parents and children are initiated at home on sex education, it will go an extra mile to enable parents understand their daughters and support them effectively , so that they will not be statistics of unwanted pregnancies , school drop outs and poor academic performance in school.
