I recall a lot of resistance to documentation of the ongoing projects of some residents in the unMonastery prototype. Documentation is important because of accountability. But it is also powerful in helping you stand your ground if and when you or your projects come under attack by loud critical voices, especially when they are wrong. Because there is a trail showing what you have been doing, why and progress- it makes your work legible to others even if they only experience a snippet and you give those who like your work the means to defend it with you. The Pisolino Libero initiative is a perfect example. The data is available: 20k likes, international coverage, private cafe owners offering space to do it inside their property. It was however not aggregated in one place prior to the email from one person in the local administration. Had it been then others in the local administration would have had no problem telling them to back off because... evidence says the project is contributing towards achieving the goals of the candidacy, whether or not one person freaks out. Or even the whole administration.\nThe other thing documentation does is gives you freedom because anyone with experience of doing anything complex knows that plans and priorities change. You may discover that the initial project or question doesnt make sense or is never going to work. Maybe you see something much more immediately relevant and actionable and want to do that instead. With continuous documentation you can follow this development and it makes it easier to tell the story of what is happening and defend the process.

And how come that trauma - such a heavy word, such a serious matter - is your passion?' That is what people ask me when they hear about my tour, about me and my bus traveling through Europe to talk and teach about trauma and to try to soften the pain of trauma. 'No, I am not on a mission (that is a far too 'religious word for me to befriend with) - and yes, trauma is my passion, and I do have a message.\nI really believe that pain should come in the open. That it should be de-tabooed: we should know more about it, understand better what traumatic pain is, how it functions, how it takes possession of us, we should be able to look at it more closely, to be with it (for a while). Trauma, pain, fear ... we'd rather not experience it or watch it happen in someone else's life. It is like with 'death': we know it is part of our lives, we all have to deal with it, and yet we don't - because it's (too) uncomfortable. How to talk about human mistreatments, heavy physical pain, profound disrespect of your person, or situations where you felt like if your life was in danger? How to share the feelings of loneliness and hopelessness that go with such pain? We often do not know how to do that, and try to ban painful events and feelings from our minds, we want to forget about it.\nIt is something in pain itself too. We're hardwired to avoid and suppress pain. It helps us survive, it helps us to go on. Avoiding, minimizing and denying pain is our most natural, short term solution to deal with pain. It is a survival mechanism. It often takes a while, from seconds to minutes, to physically feel the pain caused by an accident, a car crash or a broken leg. Not feeling the pain gives us more time to save ourselves, to get away from danger. \u00a0Out of the car, walk away and call the ambulance f.ex. On the long term, however, not feeling isn\u2019t very effective. Because it is impossible to heal from something we don't acknowledge. On the long term, suppressed pain comes back to us, like a boomerang. That is what trauma and traumatic pain is about: it is pain that doesn't seems to go away, pain that stays with us far too long, as a residue of what happened to us.\nI believe that this residual pain needs to be addressed more openly. \u00a0\nTraumatic pain can be softened - and it should be. Because unresolved trauma makes us sick, depressed and heavy-hearted. It deregulates us, deeply and on many levels: mind, heart and body. We know that traumatic pain lies at the heart of most contemporary diseases, be they mental or physical, we know that trauma adds to almost every sickness as a major contributing factor. And yet ... the knowledge about trauma and how to address it to lower its dramatic impact on our lives is far from common.\nThat is what my tour is about: I want the world to be trauma-informed.\n\n\n\n\nI want people to come and look at the pictures on the bus and ask questions. I want them to learn about trauma and realize that healing is possible. We can all learn best practices regarding talking and coping. We can all learn to calm down and regulate a body in fight, flight or freeze modus. We can all learn techniques to stop nightmares and flashbacks. We can all learn to help traumatized persons recover. It often takes not more than 15 minutes to help people sleep better: help them release tension before they go to bed, by offering a relaxing breathing exercise, or teach them to intervene in their dreams by using their imagination, by rehearsing a different ending for their nightmare f.ex.\nWe are all on a mission: to a certain degree we all need to become trauma specialists. First, we need to deal with our own trauma's and those of the people around us. We need to dare to feel and face our pain instead of running away from it. Second, there's too much suffering in the world as to leave its resolution to the clinical field or therapeutic setting. Therapeutic knowledge should be accessible to all of us, it should not be protected and copyrighted. Therapeutic knowledge should be alive in the world, not only in shrinks\u2019 offices. That is why I do what I do: share my knowledge about trauma with you, share insights, methods and techniques from the field of trauma healing ... so that we can all, together, ease and soften the pain in our world. \u00a0\nI don\u2019t know of any other projects sharing therapeutic knowledge in the way Trauma Tour does. But the idea of a trauma-informed world is related to a growing field of \u2018self care\u2019: taking responsibility for one's own (mental) health by reading self help books, attending self help groups, becoming experience experts, \u2026 It is long known that helping on this \u2018equal\u2019 level, is often more effective than any method or technique. It is also known that the relationship between \u2018therapist\u2019 and \u2018patient\u2019 is a major factor when it comes to healing. If we combine both, \u2018helping expertise\u2019 and \u2018being equal\u2019, it seems a very natural thing to come out of our offices and share therapeutic knowledge with those who suffer. It makes \u2018us\u2019 helpers and \u2018them\u2019 traumatized people equal human beings, fellow human beings.

We did it without them, but for them \u00ad and invited them to join us. It was the first time we came to know some of this population, and the more discovered and understood about them, the more stories and testimonies we collected about their lives, the less sense it made to just wrap everything up and move on to something new.\nOne of the follow\u00adups of this process was a book, in which we gathered and edited short stories from homeless people we\u2019ve met. It was published in both Flemish and French, and it made many institutions hate us, as many people in that book frankly complained about their work.\nOk, we have a bright and pretty broad vision of affairs. Now, what? We had to propose something, and the more I thought of it, the bigger it became in my head. It was overwhelming and ambitions, and I felt I can\u2019t start. That was until I met a woman, who happened to be my former student from the French classes I teach. She was a perfect partner: Flemish, woman, and a businesswoman on top of it. Together we framed the project and made it ripe for implementation in early 2012.\nIt started as a nonprofit in May 2012, but we still took a year to outline some of the details and propose a solid program. It remained complex and ambitious \u00ad and it\u2019s important to keep it that way. The organization managed to raise money from private sources to buy and renovate a building in Brussels (in fact we are still short of renovation money, and we are looking for 500.000 to get the job done). The space is so huge (650 square meters) that we can both offer support to many homeless people and invite other organizations working on the topic to use it. There is another reason why we made it so big \u00ad if the place was small and crowded with homeless from, say, Morocco, a Belgian single homeless person wouldn\u2019t enter, even if we offered what they needed. It would just feel overwhelming.\nThe mission of DoucheFLUX is to promote self\u00ad-esteem and help homeless people regain a positive image of themselves. The activities we propose do not make them feel intimidated. We forbade the usage of the words such as \"culture\" or \"art\" in the space, as well. Together with these precarious people, we produce a magazine, that is published 4\u00ad5 times a year. We also release a monthly broadcast, organize meetings in schools and film debates. Recently, we\u2019ve been busy designing a board game that allows regular people to understand and experience the hardships and challenges of homelessness. The idea wasn\u2019t mine \u00ad one of the homeless people proposed it as a way to engage with passers\u00adby. We are preparing the beta version to be ready for the Brussels Game Festival.\u2028After the opening of the building, which should happen by the end of the year, we will finally extend our services beyond going to the streets and establishing relations with the homeless. We will have 20 showers \u00ad 7 for women, 12 for men, and one for people on wheelchair. There will be also medical area and daily medical staff which our guests can appoint. This simple thing will hopefully fix once and for all the problem with access to showers in Brussels. We\u2019re in the capital of Europe, but for people on the street there is only La Fontaine, which provides one shower per person a week, and you even have to be lucky to get it.\nObviously, if we have showers, we need to have laundry. And the lockers. A huge problem among this community: there are virtually no lockers in Brussels, therefore people constantly get robbed and lose their things. As a result, they end up in a vicious circle of bureaucracy to get back whatever papers and permissions they need, and incredible insecurity. We will have 400 lockers, from super small for medicine and documents, to bigger ones.\nAnd finally, we would like to open a help desk at DoucheFlux one day. Which means we don\u2019t want to become the only organization covering all their needs \u00ad but to provide them with information on where they could be offered help with other problems. We want this to be accompanied by the first centralized website, simple and intuitive so that people who don\u2019t speak French or Flemish will be able to navigate it. It\u2019s incredible how untransparent Brussels is to these people \u00ad they have no idea where to find a lawyer, where to sleep, eat, get their medicine or find work. This idea is supported by everyone from the field in the city.\nWe are also facing some challenges around financing (we think we have reached the limits of private donations in the country at this point) and we consider turning the space into a public-\u00adprivate entity. Our bargaining chip is all our achievement \u00ad we hope the formal institutions will see it as a necessity to support an initiative that has gone so far on its own. We have 50 volunteers, we employ and pay only one person (we want to extend it to at least 2\u00ad3), and all that without a single euro from the state. I\u2019m optimistic about it \u00ad I don\u2019t think anyone would like to see us closed at that point.\nWould you like to share you experience with work with vulnerable social groups?

It has been designed by a team, led by the man who led the team designing the modern Fiat 500.\nWe also intend to make our technology available on-line, through the independent open source foundation we established called 40 Fires.\u00a0\nThe really exciting thing is that stewardship is embedded into the DNA of the company. The board are obliged by law to serve the purpose, which is \"to build and operate cars whilst systematically eliminating the environmental damage caused by personal transport.\" What's more the board are appointed by and report to, \"custodians\" who speak for different stakeholders - investors, customers, staff, suppliers, the community and the planet.

Slowly we realised - by classical 'analysing our own reality' - that the systems and relationships beyond our doors and beyond our direct influence were considerably more effective at creating disease and dysfunction than we could ever be at resolving it - especially on grant funded (frequently cut) project work, creating environments where people could find greater health and humanity.

And in it\u2019s current guise starts with Chickens. Describing his work under the banner of Urban Shepherding, it\u2019s core focus is the reintroduction of animals and agriculture back into the urban environment, at scale - as a means to influence urban development and improve social cohesion. The ambition being to establish new eco-systems in the working lives of a city\u2019s inhabitants -beyond theory- Jordan has been putting his ideas into action. \n\nIt\u2019s important to note before explaining this example of Urban Shepherding, that Jordan is an architect, working in the city\u2019s planning office and this is key to the work he\u2019s undertaking, because, in his own words \u201cwhen people can\u2019t see the whole system, they can do very unfortunate things, without even thinking\u201d.\n\nSo, it starts at his home in Gubb\u00e4ngen, a post-war suburb in the south of Stockholm. The area consists of 170 apartments spread out between 9 three storey brick houses. The structures were built in 1947 and had not undergone renovation in the last 60 years. In 2010 the landlord Stockholmshem - a state owned housing company - began an ambitious renovation project of all 170 apartments and the green space in between. Eager to take advantage of the planned disturbance, Jordan and a neighbour saw the opportunity to influence the spaces between the buildings. Using inevitable change as a channel of guided change, disturbance makes a good starting place. \n\n\nAt the back of Jordan\u2019s home, there\u2019s a garden, in the garden are two apple trees and for all intents and purposes, they were sick, ridden by a particular plague of moths that threatened the tree\u2019s wellbeing, ruining the fruits. \n\n[Strategy point: In this instance the trees were sick, but an interesting point was highlighted, if you want to unify your neighbours in a city, a good route can be to create a benign common enemy to unite against - in this instance it was the moths, but it could equally be Knotweed on an abandoned patch near ones home or something more fictional ]\nIn the first steps Jordan proceeded to explain to his neighbours the threat the moths posed, who in turn grew concerned, creating the excuse for a solution, to introduce chickens to the garden, since these chickens could eradicate the moths and their larvae, and are much more animated, fluffy and child friendly than the other alternative - pesticide\n\nThe system could not be realised alone. A small group of 4 neighbours started meeting, discussing tactics of permission and placemaking. As all residents have equal right and access to the green space, it was important to frame the system inclusively and not make this a private project. Whilst one neighbour raised the week old chickens under a heat-lamp in her bathtub (which also meant that she had to shower in the bathrooms of other neighbours), other neighbours were invited to join the \u00a0weekend activity of building a chicken coop - borrowing tools from those who had them. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis was the first move to creating a sense of shared responsibility, a social pact and line of communication between neighbours. With the coop established and the chickens growing up, a necessity grew to reinforce the social pact, caring for the chickens. Jordan introduced a \u2018sunday morning chicken tea\u2019, a regular event where neighbours could come together to hang out and clean out the coop together.\nJordan deliberately resisted putting locks on the coop, instead attached a sign explaining how to handle the chickens and their diet, so kids from the local area could feed, play with and engage the chickens. \n\u00a0\nWith the chickens becoming a natural feature, there was some significant unexpected side effects, people and the local authorities noted there had been a reduction in crime in the area. As well as the depth of sharing and communalism having visibly grown, suddenly neighbours knew each others names. By proxy of the coop the need to build and improve it necessitated the need for a shared tool shed and led to establishing almost 50 square meters of growing space. \n\nSlowly the introduction of Sunday morning socials led to more spontaneous social events between neighbours such as BBQs. Overtime this sense of collective ownership has contributed to a feeling of desirability, of a friendly neighbourhood - which led to the landlord being supportive of these developments, which in turn enabled residents to ask for the landlord to pay for elements that would improve their homes and surroundings.\n\nIn order to bolster this work Jordan also joined a local association so to influence the urban planning of the area, encouraging the architects to change the shape of shared space and their plans in order to lay groundwork for attempts to reintroduce more habitat and social space.\nIn the neighbourhood the plans don\u2019t stop here, now the tree is cured, apples can be harvested, eggs can be shared - it\u2019s led to an enthusiasm to do more, a drive to create more produce, next on the agenda is bees. Jordan described a trajectory contingent on growing responsibility, once they\u2019ve got bees, goats will be next.", "created_at": "2015-02-17 15:53:42", "updated_at": "2015-02-17 15:53:42", "tag_id": 1807, "post_id": 3614, "creator_id": 1974, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 3581}, {"id": 11327, "text": null, "quote": "After developing the concept entirely together with the explanation videos, we interviewed some of the involved stakeholders.

It is built from the ground up to provide individuals and community organizations with an alternative to State- and corporate-run emergency response infrastructures, such as making a 112 or 911 phone call in Europe or the Sates. It offers a flexible and customizable, intake, dispatch, and field support toolkit for coordinating collective action in the event of crises, whether large or small.\nUsing a smartphone or laptop computer, a community member can assemble one or more crisis support Teams, alert their support Team(s) of where they are and what they need by pressing a single button, and communicate in real-time with their support Team. Importantly, Team members can also coordinate with one another, independent of any communication from the person in crisis.\nBuoy is developed by a growing group of anti-capitalist, anti-racist, prison abolitionists calling themselves the Better Angels. We formed in the wake of the Occupy Wall Street protests in the United States, but are more inspired by movements of militant resistance against capitalist and nationalist domination such as the Zapatistas, and Rojavan Kurds abroad, and Black Lives Matter evictions of police occupation domestically.\nMany people are engaged in parallel efforts to both abolish racist systems of social control such as police and simultaneously supplant them with new systems and structures that genuinely serve a community's needs. As technologists, we recognize that technological advancement amplifies all existing power, which is why we focus technical development efforts to support pre-existing activist and community organization processes, rather than imposing new protocols or procedures. This also means we recognize that Buoy is useless for an individual without a pre-existing social support group, whether that be a Church group, family, or activist collective willing to use the tools together.\nFor this reason, Buoy is built so that it can be easily added to an existing community's social service infrastructure. Rather than embarking on creating new services, caregiving groups can add Buoy as a layer atop their existing websites. So Buoy is not a traditional \"app\" that users download in the app store, but rather a means of adding crisis response, emergency dispatch, and coordination tools to the repertoire of any organization already providing caregiving support to their membership.\nInherent in this design is a decentralized architecture that more closely mirrors the way real-life social networks and grassroots organizations are dispersed. On a technological level, it's also a practical return to the earlier days of the Internet before massive, centralized corporate services dominated the landscape of cyberspace. Nevertheless, Buoy makes use of state of the art mobile technology to provide highly accurate GPS-enabled mapping, live video, and other real-time communication tools that in many cases far exceed the meager capabilities of traditional State-run \"First Responder\" services. And we do it using strictly free software that adds no additional burden to a group's budget.\nExperience has demonstrated that there already exist a vast array of functioning alternatives to State-run care giving institutions and crisis response services. Moreover, for the vast majority of issues that people rely on State-run emergency services for, the State's responses do more harm than good. In contrast, community-run services staffed by the friends and peers of people in need provide a quality of care far superior to the level of care provided by similarly-tasked State or corporate employees. This is most obvious in the case of calling 911 in the United States for issues such as \"noise disturbances,\" which too often end in the murder of a marginalized person at the hands of a police officer.\nEnding such horrors requires, in part, providing ubiquitous access to equally-usable alternatives to existing corporate-State partnerships. Much of this alternative infrastructure already exists in certain areas, in the form of community health clinics and volunteer collectives. But one piece these groups are still missing is the technical \"last mile\" that connects community members in need with the resources that their community's already-existing volunteer services provide when and where they need it.", "created_at": "2016-09-26 23:05:55", "updated_at": "2016-09-26 23:05:55", "tag_id": 1811, "post_id": 717, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 684}, {"id": 20180, "text": "", "quote": "A gdy jest potrzeba zmiany, to zmiana jest kwiesti\u0105 czasu.", "created_at": "2020-07-07 10:14:07.901635", "updated_at": "2020-07-07 10:14:07.901635", "tag_id": 5440, "post_id": 58744, "creator_id": 6484, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 10660}, {"id": 20190, "text": "", "quote": "by\u0142y tam r\u00f3\u017cne mniejszo\u015bci", "created_at": "2020-07-07 10:26:01.789728", "updated_at": "2020-07-07 10:26:01.789728", "tag_id": 5834, "post_id": 58963, "creator_id": 6484, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 10660}, {"id": 11331, "text": null, "quote": "One of the challenges of alternative care provision is evolving tools that enable it around the needs of communities that use them, and support those who develop them.\u00a0I had a conversation with Amir Hannan, a GP working in the UK, about how\u00a0 chronic care requires patients to self-manage for good health outcomes (writeup coming soon).

It was a place where ideals could grow, and people could come listen to each other in an open dialogue. I started working on an open call to repurpose the empty Bourse building into a new Maison Du Peuple, right in the hearth of the city. But just days after finishing the text the attacks in Bataclan occurred and life in Brussels changed dramatically for a couple of weeks\u2026\nI gave it a rest and set my focus on a vacant building above the well-known music bar Bonnefooi: 4 floors, 500m2, and lots of potential, but also lots of work to be done. Without any budget or action plan, I started gathering people in the house, now called Huis VDH. The only thing I knew was that I wanted an inclusive project build from a common idea: Designing a semi-public space in such a way that the wellbeing of the neighbourhood / city improves. Huis VDH will therefore become a test case, because it isn\u2019t the first or last vacant space above a shop in Brussels: there are more than 23 000 m2 documented.\nSo there we were, having a space, an open concept and a lot of potential. The first thing we did was taking time to create a common practice: we designed our way of gathering through a futurism session created by Fo.AM that allowed us to gather all ideas from each person who wanted to get involved and, like a funnel, filter only the most common. For us, it was important to make Huis VDH as open as possible, so that any new member with the right mind-set could easily become a full involved partner in the building process. After a philosophical six months, we had the sprout of an idea: Huis VDH was born.\nIt\u2019s all in the name, for Huis VDH it is no other. \u2018Huis\u2019 means \u2018home\u2019 in Dutch and that is what we are aiming to become for people that are drowning in a sea of complexity of city life. We try to not judge each other, but rather think solution oriented: Help out where we can, and bring the right people around the table. Our space is designed to welcome each kind of small organization working on local issues: cultural, social or technological. We try to design each space so it can be multifunctional and become a temporary rest spot for thosein search of an anchor. We believe like edgeryders: \u201c that the power of a community is bigger than the sum of all parts.\u201d\nOne big challenge we will be facing in the next couple of years is to use our talent to organize ourselves within crisis.

Especially in the Balkans because of the tradition, male dominance and patriarchy dogma, we can`t even speak about gender equality. Violence against women is a common phenomenon, discrimination in employment, obtaining dismissal due to pregnancy, sexual harassment at work, on the street, not to mention the Roma communities, where women have almost no rights, the situation is bad, and even alarming.\nWomen are treated as less valuable, challenging their basic human rights. The right to education, freedom of movement, the right to vote, the right to decide about their marriage, not to be forced, mutilated or rejected by family, society if they do not abide by traditional rules and norms, teen marriage, teen pregnancy, violence against a woman, more often situation.\nThe violence being perpetrated against girls and women it takes on epidemic proportions.\nAnd instead of every day a woman to be given more heed, honored, a pillar of society and the family, it is at the margin, not only neglected but also abused, physically and mentally exhausted,, without the right to fight for themselves ,their \u00a0life, their well-being.\nWomen who are the most oppressed are precisely those without education, personal income . How many women and girls were sexually exploited, raped ...\nWhat are the primary tasks?\n\u00a0To be primarily pledge any form of violence and abuse, to provide education, training. Selection of partners is free will, the right to contraception, the right to health care, the right to equal pay, the right to be employed, not to be discriminated just because it's a woman, it does not get fired when she went on maternity leave, to receive compensation while pregnant, the right to social protection, in health insurance and care.\nThe right to engage in politics of his country, to participate in the economy, not only as a worker, but also as an entrepreneur, manager, trustee\nTo be more women in science, the arts, that were not created just to take care of home, children, family, that are free to read, write, engage in teachings, scientific research\u2026.\nMany seem that women seek the impossible, seek the same thing does not belong to them. Women do not seek a special status, not seeking privileges.\nWomen \u00a0demand the respect that every human being deserves, looking for the opportunity to be the best version of yourself, achieve talents, looking for an opportunity to live freely, go towards achieving its objectives without fear that they will be attacked, abuse, put down, ridiculed\u2026 crippled\nMany studies have shown the importance of women in large companies and how important it is to have greater participation of women in the labor,\u00a0The whole society has benefits and profit from that, also\u00a0economic empowerment of women can give them the strength and the power to fight for their rights.\u00a0What is I have to emphasis\u00a0totally crazy, to fight for something that is obvious and should be guaranteed.\u00a0But since we live in such a country and such a world, which I will say freely that's gone completely crazy.\nThe first thing we have to teach girls, because some things are taught from childhood, that the slap is not love, that no one have right to beat you, there is no reason to be afraid. You have\u00a0to forget that terrible sentence, you're a girl, you you have to let go, you have to listen, \u00a0you must be good,\u00a0obedient\nWell, \u00a0you do not have to do anything\nBe good and obedient and you'll be good and obedient patients\nIf you're a girl, you do not have to do anything that you do not like, house, kids, kitchen, It is not your job by default, \u00a0you can be scientist, pilot, astroanut, everything you want\nOf course, a question of love, partners, children, number of children, or abortion, should be your choice, initiation of sex and number of partners is also your thing, \u00a0to love, to be loved, free, jealousy is not proof of love, respect and friendship are very important, you have a right to do what you want when you want and not worry about social norms, because only happy persone have good thoughts and \u00a0works good, Society where women are sitting home and deal with the housework is dead. We need all the strengths and capable\u00a0and smart and successful women, because obviously while men are leding,\u00a0we can not talk about peace and prosperity, we should agree to disagree, to respect and appreciate each to give\u00a0positive example because children learn from their parents, scattered on the model, so change must start from family, parents, environment, kindergartens, schools ... this is serious story , a wide and large, but the success is guaranteed if we work together, jointly, it is not enough to have a law that sanctioned violence, because in every segment of society and at every step of women suffer some form of discrimination, some form of abuse, violence, really suffer if they are young and pretty, and if they are ugly and old, have always been the subject of ridicule, gossip, and never good enough and ther is \u00a0always something wrong , they have to be perfect to be loved because they are \u00a0upbringing in that manner, it is a huge burden, that burden must be rejected, it's okay to be imperfect it's okay to have a bad day, to smilie\u00a0and \u00a0to be good...\nIt is a great theme, and very serious and \u00a0requires indispensable\u00a0large and big steps to make the change, so we\u00a0won't\u00a0any more\u00a0read about dark statistics or to be a part of it,\nI forgot about inadequate or not existing\u00a0 health status of women and treating them, how horrible gynecologist acting,\u00a0a large number of cancers that are not detected at time, shame, \u00a0when they\u00a0give birth listen insults and so on...\n\u00a0I want you to understant situation in my country, importance of the problem and that action is needed, that will not be easy, but it is something that must do\u00a0because it is not a choice any more it is our obligation.", "created_at": "2017-06-26 13:35:11", "updated_at": "2017-06-26 13:35:11", "tag_id": 1823, "post_id": 858, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 825}, {"id": 11373, "text": null, "quote": "It\u2019s a virtual reality environment based on audio.

But, a technology that enables blind and vision impaired to mediate their perception of their environment and interact with their surroundings is actually empowering then to be independent from aid devices.\nMany blind and partially sighted people of all ages are unable to lead independent lives because they are not getting the support they need. The needs of people who lose their sight are many and varied and the support provided must be personalized if it is to meet individual needs. Teaching the blind to see with hearing using echolocation would be a way to make the largest impact, beyond the use of sight. \u00a0The benefits of acquiring this skill changes the way you interact with your surroundings on a daily basis. It decreases limitations and opens the door to new opportunities.\nThe Journey begins\n\nIrene Lanza, Management Engineer, CEO of SoundSight Training, knows it\u2019s possible. Irene came in contact with the Scimpulse Foundation while participating in the Challenge Based Innovation program of Ides2quare at CERN in Geneva. The challenge was to design something that enabled blind people to perceive the surrounding environment. It was then the idea was planted. \u00a0Many opted for a mobile device approach, something else called the attention of Irene. Teaching the blind to echolocate themselves?\nThrough this experience, Irene had the opportunity to interact with the visually impaired. Through working with mothers of blind children and getting to hear their stories, setbacks and concerns the more Irene wanted to do something to support and empower them. Guidance of blind and visually impaired people is a clear unmet need. However, most blind and visually impaired people want to go out and enjoy independent mobility.\nThe environment in which we live is becoming increasingly complex. Even a journey across a city \u00a0requires a range of skills including being able to avoid obstacles on the pavement, to walk in the right direction, play a sport and the list goes on. These tasks may seem trivial, but for someone with a vision impairment, this is a challenge and a skill that needs to be learned. SoundSight enables the development of a hearing talent that compensates for the missing eyesight.\nSee With Sound\n\u00a0\nSoundSight Training was developed to enable the blind to see with sound. Together, with Henrik Kjeldsen and Dr. Marco Manca the first prototype of an echolocation training system, was created.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a virtual reality environment based on audio. The training is completed with practice in the real world until the student becomes fully independent from the simulation. Further explanation of how can be found here. SoundSight attracted the attention of the Italian government and a number of organisations and advocates that offered its support. \u00a0Among them were, Cecilia Camellini, Champion Paralympic Swimmer. When asked what she thought of SoundSight, \u201cwith training and effort athletes can improve performance.\u201d \u00a0\nExperience the world more independently\nSoundSight Training is a spinoff of the Let Me See Project, the first from the ScimPulse Foundation \u00a0I.M.mortal research program. It was a 3 year journey that started from a workshop and now partners with governmental organizations to impulse the idea forward beyond the prototype stage. Now it has its own heartbeat. SoundSight Training designed to helping people explore the world more independently.\n\u201cThis software has the potential to enrich the lives of people who are blind and visually impaired. Everyone can learn this skill, it\u2019s accessible to everyone and when we design for greater accessibility, everyone benefits.\u201d says Irene Lanza. \u00a0\u00a0\nImproving performance, challenging yourself, to overcome limitations, all of this effects humanity\u2019s growth, expansion and well-being. The challenges for the visually impaired are enormous, so immense are the ramifications for those now living without sight, and so exciting is the initiative on the horizon.\nFor more information about SoundSight initiative, please visit www.soundsight.ch", "created_at": "2017-02-11 19:47:10", "updated_at": "2017-02-11 19:47:10", "tag_id": 1828, "post_id": 701, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 668}, {"id": 11378, "text": null, "quote": "Thank you for the comments regarding SoundSight. @andra Pop The project is moving along at its pace, as much time is dedicated to working with the blind community, as they are part of the co-creation team.

It is estimated that worldwide over 508,000 women died in 2011 from breast cancer (Global Health Estimates, WHO 2013). This represents about 12% of all new cancer cases and 25% of all cancers in women.\nIn all countries, early detection remains the cornerstone of breast cancer control in order to improve breast cancer outcome and survival. In health systems with developed infrastructure, physicians regularly examine the breast as part of a routine female check-up (usually once or twice a year) in addition to mammography. However, this routine procedure is \u00a0provided at varying levels of time investment and care.\nDiscovering hands has a number of advantages:\nBy using the extraordinary sensory capabilities of visually impaired women, a perceived \u201cdisability\u201d is transformed into a capability. A completely new field of meaningful employment is created.\n\u201cMedical Tactile Examiners\u201d (MTEs) are trained to deliver physical breast examinations at doctors\u2019 practices. During a 9-month training period they learn how to use a standardized diagnostic method for examining the female breast. Additionally, all MTEs are trained in communication skills and breast-specific psychology, as well as administrative tasks typically carried out by a doctor\u2019s assistant. MTEs are either directly employed by resident doctors or hospitals, or they work for different practices and/or hospitals on a freelance basis.\nConventionally, a regular breast examination carried out by a gynecologist takes between 1 and 3 minutes. The discovering hands MTE invests at least 30 minutes for each session, not only examining the breast, but also educating patients on how to cope with the risk of breast cancer. Patients feel that they are well taken care of and receive the best possible preventive examination in a pleasant environment.\nPreliminary qualitative results, conducted by the University of Essen, show that MTEs detect ~50% more and ~28% smaller tissue alterations in the breast than doctors (5-8mm vs. 10-15mm). A clinical, peer reviewed study is currently being conducted at the University of Erlangen.\nOur vision\nWe are operating as a social business because we believe in the our value proposition (to the healthcare sector, and institutions supporting people with disabilities). We are committed to the social \"win-win\" of our model: offering meaningful employment to blind women, and creating an opportunity for them where they have competitive strength; and helping to improve the breast cancer early identification situation and awareness for the most common cancer among women.\nCurrent roll-out\nDiscovering hands is planning to substantially increase the number of MTEs in the years to come. We currently operate in Germany and in Austria. In both India and Colombia we have pilot projects running with scale-up in planning. And we are interested in further country roll-out, which we operate through a social franchise.\nIf you are a social entrepreneur and would like to implement discovering hands in your country, contact us. Also, if you are an impact investor and are interested in collaborating with us to further roll-out the model, please contact us too.

A virtual gym to train echolocation, and while the idea of features and UX design accumulated quickly, the team pursued a proof-of-concept and something that others could think of as a minimum viable product.\nThe first prototype was a mess. To the users invited to a test, it must have seemed unbelievable how a software engineer could have thought that a piece of software reverberating in a fixed environment and artificial sound would have been enough to suggest how the platform would work. Not to mention, a command line interface, and a rather lengthy procedure to change the position within the simulated environment. But thanks to the outgoing and always positive outlook of Irene, they never thought of disinvesting: SoundSight was an experience for them.\nThe team worked hectically on Irene\u2019s feedbacks, and a really workable proof-of-concept finally became available around Spring 2015.\n\u00a0\nLet\u2019s leave it again to Irene\u2019s recollection:\nIrene: \u201cHello Mario[1], we are here again\u2026 this time I promise you will be impressed\u201d\nMario: \u201cHi Irene, it\u2019s a pleasure\u2026 and rest assured, last time I was already impressed, although maybe not as you hoped for\u2026 with my friends we have been laughing a lot about your engineer\u2019s idea of a prototype!\u201d\nIrene: \u201cOh no, Mario\u2026 don\u2019t abuse him, or who knows when we will find another person with the same talent and will to do something meaningful even with no immediate profit in sight!

Somehow contributing to its realization makes me proud. However, you need my honest opinions, and I think the ability to exploit the user\u2019s own tongue click will improve the experience terrifically.

It was a cathedral\u2026 now that I have told you, could you confirm it or would you still be doubtful?\u201d\nMario: \u201cLet me try to listen again\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u2026the simulator runs again shortly\nMario: \u201cYes Irene, now that I know, it could well be\u2026 I had some doubts, with no context it could have been a theater or a large gym, \u2026\u201d\nIrene: \u201cIndeed\u2026 now I would like you to do a few exercises\u2026 I will tell you this time what you are going to listen to, precisely, and you will have to focus on the features\u2026 later there will be a test\u2026\u201d\nMario: \u201cFor me or for the software?\u201d\nIrene: \u201cFor both, Mario, don\u2019t try to escape your responsibilities\u201d\nMario: \u201cAhahah\u201d\n\u00a0\nThey run the training set\nMario: \u201cWell Irene, we will see how I perform later\u2026 but you should consider developing an interface to feed information about structures, volumes, and positions, directly to your users\u2026 it is nice to chat with you, but if you really think of this as a tool for making echolocation training accessible to anyone, the fact that you need to have by your side another person as your interface to the system doesn\u2019t add up\u201d\nIrene: \u201cYou are right. Together with the real-time acquisition of users\u2019 clicks, this interface is at the top of our list of priorities. We are thinking of using a simple tablet of mechanically executed needles to offer a map of the space being tested and a natural interface\u2026 or some haptic 3D interface, but that may be more expensive and complicated. We have not yet looked into that enough\u201d\nMario: \u201cYou would need a lot of needles to offer a useful interface\u2026 you can try prototyping something quick maybe with Arduino\u2026 but I would be a lot more curious about the haptic interface. I have seen some applications with holograms and they looked impressive.\u201d\nIrene: \u201cWe will keep this in mind. Of course, we need to make it as simple and cheap as possible, but still functional\u2026 and we hope the prices of that hardware will be democratized soon. Now that we have taken a small break\u2026\u201d\nMario: \u201cWhat break? Are you not letting me off yet?\u201d\nIrene: \u201cMario, let\u2019s just take the test before the coffee\u2026 I will let you off then, for today\u201d\nMario: \u201cOk, ok\u2026 a no is not possible anyway, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nIrene: \u201cIt\u2019s always possible, but I will insist with a smile\u201d\nThey run the tests\nIrene: \u201dif we compare today\u2019s performances to those from the last tests, both with the software and in the lab with the moving panels, you have really gotten better Mario!\u201d\nMario: \u201cBut Irene, how can I be sure if I have truly learned? I mean\u2026 we should arrange tests where there are coupled with some sort of benchmark\u2026 maybe similar tests in real world, you could imagine a mobile lab to do so\u2026 or even just arrange competitions among users\u201d\nIrene: \u201cThat\u2019s a really good idea, Mario! We will seriously reflect on how to arrange this, but for the time being\u2026 do you think your partner would like to try it out against you?\u201d\nMario: \u201cBut she sees\u2026\u201d\nIrene: \u201cit should not be an advantage, and I promise you I will not show her the screen\u201d\nThis is now a different story\u2026 but after being initially baffled, Mario\u2019s partner took it to her heart to seriously compete with him, and in the end, she won one of the tests, confirming anyone can learn this skill.\n1\u00a0Please be reminded that Mario is a blind guy.

The use of \u201cpeople-first language\u201d* in English aims to \u201cavoid the subconscious dehumanization when discussing people with disabilities\u201d[2]. However, as the researches continue and after we interviewed a few people with disabilities, we soon realized that language is not really a problem. Every person we interviewed all said that the word \u201cdisability\u201d doesn\u2019t bother them at all and they don\u2019t mind being called \u201cdisabled\u201d because it is a fact. (Interview with Raul Krauthausen by @Moriel).\nSo here is the question, if the language / term / vocabulary doesn't matter as much as we think, where does the problem really lies?\nAnother example would be: why is it okay to say someone has dark hair but not okay to say someone is a gay or someone is a black especially in the western countries? It is because people who used these terms earlier in the history had a strong prejudice and discrimination in mind. In the end, language was created to describe things as how they are. There is nothing wrong with language itself if people don\u2019t think otherwise to begin with.\nCould it be that some of us\u2014people without physical disabilities\u2014think that the current terms we use are offensive is because we are subconsciously offending them in the first place? So the question is not how to change the language, or other visible things. The question is how we can change people\u2019s opinion.", "created_at": "2017-04-15 19:39:21", "updated_at": "2017-04-15 19:39:21", "tag_id": 1829, "post_id": 694, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 661}, {"id": 11384, "text": null, "quote": "I found this an interesting read.

In terms of players I found a couple really cheap at banggood.com (with earplugs & cable!) but I had problems ordering so I used various amazons (B001B43J8E and B01LAE19D6 ) for now. I actually want very limited capability on the players to start with so that you have to listen through a lecture to get to the infotainment/music part behind it. The cheapo players are fine for that. The other thing that is partially a feature is their crappy 110mAh battery. Currently I am testing the common failure modes, and it also looks like it will be possible to run them without battery directly from either a bucked 12V battery, or a boosted low voltage source (AAA), and of course sunny PV. All of those options (and more) will be in a full kit. In terms of wearing them - they work fine under a hat or headscarf. With 15g they should not be much of a nuisance around the neck either.\nAs for mp3 recorder I think you are right - there is no really cheap option. I've bought this ASIN B01G8OK1O6 for 20$ and it works very well so far. However at that cost I can't hand them out to just anyone, but I first have to find reliable candidates. Probably I'll also have to work with other recording formats in the beginning. There are a couple of other somewhat decent recorders around 10-15$ but they don't save into mp3 or aren't exactly inuitive.\nRegarding your translation (I assume mostly into audio format) this is what I would do: Go around at the schools and ask the teachers if they can recommend someone who has a nice voice and good pronounciation and English skills. Ugliness, bad eyesight, physical deformity, rural upbringing is all a big plus. Probably won't hurt if you let 3-5 try translating and recording the same piece. Then find someone above average knowledgeable in the actual field work who has a somewhat deeper understanding of the issues and let him/her review the recordings. That is your first team.

With a few technologists I\u00a0prototyped some systems that used voice recordings to play back these \"real\" expressions to others.\u00a0Again the emphasis was not on mental illness but on the similarities and the differences in the\u00a0longings of the inhabitants of particular locations - the project was inspired by thinking about\u00a0how it might be possible to\u00a0make networks in Nepal that in some way help\u00a0the expression and social processing of the shock around the earthquake.\u00a0However,\u00a0there had been a depth in\u00a0the experience of the interchanges that had happened\u00a0whilst\u00a0making the recordings that were\u00a0more interesting than the voice playback system. The interviews\u00a0always came out of a \"live\" sharing of experience (ie. the interviewee's expeirences and my own) and involved risk,\u00a0personal disclosure,\u00a0agency and shared discovery in a way that listening to a recording does not.\u00a0I am still wondering about\u00a0digital systems that allow\u00a0people to talk directly to each other in a structured way that could help them process their emotional situations. And I considered the various kinds of\u00a0conversations people might want - just to speak or perhaps a more formal recorded conversation that involved making a commitment.\u00a0Witnessed formal\u00a0statements - like rituals - can create marker points in people's lives.\u00a0Alchoholic's anonymous is probably a relevant example.\u00a0I wondered about the Samaritans model which sets up this sense that you can make a telephone\u00a0call if you are desperate and the \"Samaritan\" is steady,\u00a0sane and absolutely OK. I wonder about\u00a0a network\u00a0that simply says: whatever you are going through is part of the human experience ie. there is no\u00a0broken experience, but there certainly is incredibly challenging experience. \u00a0\nIt feels like a\u00a0given that two people who are\u00a0in grief may find solace in sharing their\u00a0real experience and connecting.\u00a0\u00a0And yet, to generalise,\u00a0Western communities often put empahsis on usefulness in society and direct\u00a0those\u00a0exhibiting signs of mental distress to simply \"be OK\"\u00a0/ go on medication / fix themeselves\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0I totally agree with the point you are bringing out that\u00a0\"the community\" is often woefully\u00a0dysfunctional at supporting or accepting unusual emotional situations. I wonder about a network that\u00a0links people as humans wanting to share something specific in a particular area of the world - so the region is the unifier, not the emotional suffering.\u00a0Perhaps I'm thinking of a more generalised target audience than you are considering but my sense is after walking Liverpool,\u00a0that everyone\u00a0who lives in a distributed\u00a0area\u00a0is in\u00a0someway involved in processing the emotions experienced in\u00a0that place. I'm aware this is a poetic notion but I think\u00a0various imaginative\u00a0re-framings\u00a0of the issue of mental health\u00a0is what's needed. Maybe this would only work as a\u00a0three way conversation with someone trained and with really\u00a0clear guidelines around use but my thinking here is that what's needed is not this expert / patient relationship but two humans sharing different experiences of living in a similar\u00a0place.\u00a0\nMy friend Denis Ngala at\u00a0TICAH, the Trust for Indigenous Culture and Health, an organisation in Kenya that works in linking\u00a0health and cultural knowledge was telling me about the work that was being done in Kenya\u00a0around victims of torture and reintegrating them back into society after they had given freedom again. The emphasis\u00a0he was communicating\u00a0was that recovery was not the problem of the victim\u00a0of torture\u00a0alone, but that it was the\u00a0community's task. They were working\u00a0to educate the community around how to support the individual live beyond\u00a0what they had lived through.\nReal-life conversations from real experience in which neither party is an expert\u00a0can be life changing.\u00a0I work a lot with VR and seeing through another's eyes is certainly helpful but what\u00a0really leads to\u00a0change is\u00a0honestly communicating difficult\u00a0experience and listening to others and accepting their experience. There's some sort of validation in the honesty of that\u00a0process that allows for shifts.\u00a0There are lots of CBT, brain training, \"look at things brighter\" apps around but perhaps\u00a0there's room for bold\u00a0digital networks - with some serious legal tick boxes in place\u00a0-\u00a0that\u00a0make possible structured honest relational\u00a0experiences between people in a particular place. It feels like using the digital to practice honestly speaking and\u00a0speaking in one's own name rather than anonymously would be helpful at this point. The histories of Snapchat et al. show the many superficial\u00a0ways that communication can go, but\u00a0there's a saviness emerging around\u00a0structuring and limiting online\u00a0encounter and creating a precise\u00a0invitation that makes me think it's possible. Online experiences\u00a0that move\u00a0into\u00a0relational and creative territory and away\u00a0from the sense that\u00a0mental difficulties have to be born alone like a scapegoat in the desert or solved once and for all\u00a0like winning in a\u00a0game - there's something about the unique experience of another person that is a random element that can startle out of insularity.

Show the world how Turkey has vowed to support Azerbaijan till the end. Remind them of our history and tell them our story. Our story through the millennia. Our story of struggle and survival and for our right to have our place on this fragile planet.\" Maria Titizyan\n\"The timing of these events should not be a surprise. Azerbaijan's economy is in terrible shape right now. Their currency dropped 40% in value against the dollar in January. Their entire economy is almost completely tied to oil and oil prices are at the lowest point in a decade. Mass protests against corruption and a depressed economy in Azerbaijan have increased in recent months. Invading Nagorno-Karabagh is an attempt to boost nationalism and act as a distraction from real problems at home. All that plus Russia's deteriorating relationship with Turkey, a strong political ally of Azerbaijan, creates a terrible condition for Azerbajian to act aggressively against Nagorno-Karabakh.\" \u00a0Erik Yesayan\n\"Armed with the knowledge of the history of this conflict, it is easy to discern that it is not in Artsakh\u2019s interests to break the peace and renew hostilities. Instead, it is Azerbaijan that wishes to retake control of land which, due to the political maneuvering of a third higher power, temporarily fell into its hands but over which it has no legitimate claim.\" Aram Hovasapyan\nRight now both sides agreed on a temporary ceasefire\u00a0while Armenia's president is meeting OSCE in Vienna and Azeri PM is in\u00a0Iran to attend a meeting with\u00a0foreign ministers of Iran\u00a0and Turkey...hope this will de-escalate sooner than later...\nAdditional reading:\nhttps://goo.gl/ci3lFU\nhttp://goo.gl/x4XTSJ\nhttp://goo.gl/j6jqUe\nhttp://goo.gl/1jv07R", "created_at": "2017-04-15 19:54:06", "updated_at": "2020-09-30 18:03:45.488002", "tag_id": 6758, "post_id": 33738, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 6587}, {"id": 11419, "text": null, "quote": "Answering that question requires examining the roots of the conflict, the context in which it arose, and the factors that have kept it going.

On the one hand, there\u2019s \u2018AI optimism: the view that the increasingly ubiquitous use of AI is inevitable, that we can\u2019t return to not using AI once we have deployed it in a given domain. The implicit assumption behind that view often seems to be something like, \"well, if AI is inevitable, there isn't really a point in trying to critique it ethically\"\u2014or to critique it politically, even. On this view, AI is nothing more than a tool\u2014and one that promises to have a decidedly positive impact on society. On the other hand, there is a dramatically opposing view that says something like, \u201cit is inevitable that all AI will lead to incredibly bad and harmful consequences\u201d. That\u2019s a different sense of inevitability right there. Tech pessimists seem to think that whatever we do, whichever domain we focus on in our AI deployment, the use of automated reasoning methods will always be somehow counterproductive or harmful.I think both views are wrong. The first view underestimates our ability to subject AI to productive scepticism, public oversight, and collective control. Even if it is inevitable that we will be using more and more AI in our collective decision-making processes, we ought to keep reflecting critically on AI\u2019s purpose. There might be some collective decision-making problem domains where it would be ethically and politically inadequate to use AI because we intuitively feel that when things go wrong in those domains, we want a human decision-maker to blame; we want somebody to justify to us why a particular decision outcome was reached. In those domains, we are often quite happy to not be maximally efficient or accurate. What we really want is to think and argue with each other about how best to arrange our political and social life, about what it would mean to have a just society, about how we can relate to each other as true equals. These are ultimately not just ethical, but fundamentally political questions. Of course, tech optimists might reply to the response that I just gave: \u201cbut clearly AI will optimize our collective decision-making!\u201d To that, I think a more nuanced and sceptical view might say in response, \u201cwell, optimising isn't everything\u201d. We must exercise our critical judgment to determine when optimising further and further, and thereby entrenching and accelerating our current social status quo, is actually what matters most. And in many cases, that might not be what justice requires. But at the same time, the second view that I outlined before\u2014the tech pessimists\u2019 view\u2014can also be misleading. It is misleading in the sense that it equates all forms of AI and machine-learning, including their ethical importance and impact, with each other. I do not think that that is plausible at all. Not all forms of AI will lead to the same kinds of harmful outcomes. It is especially important to ask: where and how can we use AI to mitigate injustice rather than exacerbating it? Nuanced ethical and political engagement with new technologies requires avoiding sweeping generalisations. But, it is clear that, as a general principle, if using algorithmic decision-making in a particular decision domain moves us further away from justice, then we have a strong presumption against using it in that domain.", "created_at": "2020-11-25 11:00:05.434371", "updated_at": "2020-11-25 11:00:05.434371", "tag_id": 7313, "post_id": 75832, "creator_id": 5479, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 13438}, {"id": 27110, "text": "", "quote": "Doing ethics well means getting comfortable with that sense of uncertainty surrounding these trade-offs: there is a risk that we might get things wrong, and a good way of confronting that risk is to keep asking questions, rather than committing to one ethical argument at one point in time (a view like: \u201cIrrespective of the domain of application, always prioritize accuracy over transparency!\u201d) and then trying to just apply it without ever revisiting it.

But, unsurprisingly, the world is shaped by a history of inequality and injustice, and technological models interact dynamically with the social world. So, whatever new data gets fed back into our algorithmic model will reflect those inequalities in our status quo to some extent.

They are breeding grounds for social innovations and new bottom-up-strategies. Often people take initiative when traditional or institutional forms of care and support decline or do not meet people\u2019s needs. Community gardens and urban agriculture- the field in which I am personally engaged- can serve as a good example. Without being part of planning, or political programs, these places are mostly created by local, self-organized initiatives. Based on local engagement and alternative forms of economy and often without public or financial support, community gardens contribute to the well-being, social inclusion, healthy and sustainable lifestyles, biodiversity, the physical- as well as the social climate. Not only they contribute to the physical health of their participants, but also to their sense of dignity and self-esteem.\nThere is also a downside to community engagement. While community organizations have to promote themselves with success stories to get recognition, political- and financial support, the negative aspects are often less visible. You hear a lot about precarious funding, internal or outside conflicts, political and economic pressure, multitasking, impossible workloads, competition between projects. At the same time, dealing with complex and often rigid political and social institutions, community activists have to become self-trained experts in finances, public relations, lobbying, community-organizing etc. But these fights are long and complex and the institutions and their procedures require a patience that easily outlive the time, the physical and mental resources individuals and grassroots initiatives are able to mobilize.\nOver time, this situation can result in what you might call an \u201eactivism-burnout\u201c. When this happens, physical, mental, and social damages are far too often just seen as a personal or biographical drama. These individual burn-outs are likely to be accompanied by a weakening or even a collapse of the organizations and initiatives that are often carried by the engagement of single individuals. The disintegration can lead to a situation where an organization loses knowledge, expertise, networks, and spirit.\nFor the reasons mentioned above, community care should also include structures to support the people that are directly invested in it. It should create securing and supporting networks. Instead of competing, it should allow people from different initiatives in different fields of engagement to share their knowledge of failure. There should be at once structures of collective learning and consultancy, which at the same time help the individuals to find spaces of trust and recreation. With the Neighborhood Academy, we started informal meetings with members of different groups and initiatives, not only to exchange experience and knowledge and to broaden networks and alliances, but also to deal with stress, conflict, fear, doubt, and failure on a more personal level. Even though this is just a tentative beginning, we experience a need for this kind of care and support structures, which was previously not expressed. Often issues related to the stressful conditions of organizations and community initiatives are externalized into the private and infuse personal relations . Therefore on a structural level, we see these caring structures also as a\u00a0form to win even when you lose.\nCommunity groups often focus on single questions, spaces, conflicts. They often react under economic and time pressure to immediate problems. They act within marginalized or weak political and economical communities. They deal with institutions and stakeholders with more time, much power, and resources whereas they rely on limited personal resources or precarious funding. Simultaneously there are a lot of joy, learning and personal empowerment involved as well as a sense of a meaningful life and community relations. However, the risk of failing is high, which can lead to frustration and disintegration.\nCommunity care structures can help to ease this stress not only in giving support but also in a form of what we call \u201ecollective learning\u201c. They can work as an archive for the knowledge, the experiences and know-how being created in grassroots and community initiatives. Thus, they allow activists to see themselves not only as part of a\u00a0singular local fight that you might win or lose\u00a0but as contributors to a collective living memory.", "created_at": "2017-02-28 01:19:00", "updated_at": "2017-02-28 01:19:00", "tag_id": 377, "post_id": 507, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 474}, {"id": 20070, "text": "", "quote": "Kr\u00e9dem na\u0161\u00ed spole\u010dnosti je b\u00fdt fair play \u2013 na tom je zalo\u017een\u00e1 na\u0161e firemn\u00ed kult\u016fra a mysl\u00edm, \u017ee i na\u0161i z\u00e1kazn\u00edci to oce\u0148uj\u00ed a d\u00edky tomu jsou loaj\u00e1ln\u00ed, win-win, ale j\u00e1 jsem tak byl vychov\u00e1n, tak\u017ee mi to p\u0159ijde jako p\u0159irozenost\u2026", "created_at": "2020-06-30 20:27:41.624916", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:26:33.691821", "tag_id": 822, "post_id": 62150, "creator_id": 6339, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 11247}, {"id": 27141, "text": "", "quote": "This sounds simple and intuitive, but it has dramatic implications for how we can and should tackle problems like unfair algorithmic decision outcomes.

These are theories about how we should distribute benefits and burdens in society, but also about how we should relate to each other. So, it\u2019s not only about allocating goods and benefits to people, but also about thinking about the social relations and structures that we ought to create and maintain: what it means to respect each other as equals, and what we owe each other on an interpersonal level. What does it mean to treat each citizen in our society with respect, given that there are going to be some inequalities that we possibly can't eliminate? For example, we can\u2019t change the fact that people are born with different natural talents and abilities, but most of us think that your access to basic resources and basic rights shouldn't depend on those \u2018undeserved\u2019 features that you are born with. In addition, it is also plausible to think that if an individual or group is structurally disadvantaged in society, we should prioritise the interests and the voices of members of that group in processes of collective decision-making in some form. So, if we are going to have inequalities in our society, those inequalities ought to be arranged in a way that benefit those who are worst off the most. Many analytic political philosophers, especially those working in the 20th century, have been thinking about that question. In addition, feminist philosophers and critical race theorists have called our attention to the idea that we should not treat the social and political status quo as just by default: justice is not only about ensuring compliance with the rules governing our existing social institutions\u2014it is also about  transforming those institutions as a whole, and about being accountable for historical patterns of injustice.", "created_at": "2020-11-25 11:16:06.041721", "updated_at": "2020-11-25 11:16:06.041721", "tag_id": 4874, "post_id": 75832, "creator_id": 5479, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 13438}, {"id": 20181, "text": "", "quote": "Wygl\u0105da na to, \u017ce post\u0119pujesz w\u0142a\u015bciwie.

FES bikes are quite expensive so where to go to try them? Many places and cycle lanes are missing so it requires some changes to infrastructure as well. But as long as nobody uses them it's a vicious circle. Therefore we need more awareness to reduce cost, change infrastructure and increase inclusion in the cycle community\nEven handbikes which are more popular can\u2019t be bought in a normal bicycle shop, but rather directly from a few specialized companies. The lack of marketing incurs high costs to manufacturers and hence to clients.\nMy own group\u2019s response as research and practitioners is to create a culture to promote this change, a project in the making. How can we promote actual experience based dialogue between users (who are maybe hackers) and researchers? There is an international community of researchers, so there should be a good chance of of finding local experts. As someone with a disability, you could connect with them and hack - evolve - test collaboratively cheap functional solutions in a healthcare hacking space. Dr Fitzwater, who is both a researcher and FES cycler, reports on the need to make benefits enjoyable in addition to positive medical outcomes: \u201cThe FESC function should be capable of being used on the open road with or without friends and family and be easily usable without any more assistance than that already required for the activities of daily living\u201d.\nWhy should you, me or anyone care about the future of research? you want to see your tax money spent well, don\u2019t you? And most importantly, this could be you or a relative who would like to go for a ride and have drastically limited options.

One such algorithm is called COMPAS\u2014a tool that various states in the US having been using for a few years now\u2014to determine whether an offender is \u2018high risk\u2019 or \u2018low risk\u2019, and that according to a well-known investigation by ProPublica, it was more likely to classify Black defendants as \u2018high risk\u2019 in comparison to similar white defendants. Of course, what it means to be a \u2018high risk individual\u2019 is subject to disagreement\u2014whether those who design algorithmic tools explicitly acknowledge that or not. Algorithms are not inherently neutral, because we still have to make conscious choices when we design systems, including choices influenced by implicit bias and stereotypes. Of course, we could try to approximate what riskiness in this context means by looking at things like: has this person committed previous offences? Is she in an unstable economic situation? Do her social networks include a lot of other people who recidivate? Some of those variables might be more appropriate to use than others, right? For instance, one might think it\u2019s inappropriate to make inferences from the behaviour of your friends and family whether you in fact will be guilty of criminal conduct again in the future. Some predictions might be more ethically and politically defensible than others. Similarly, we have to be attuned to the fact that even if you have a list of prior offences, that might be partially dependent on your social context, which we may want to consider as a mitigating factor. But it is often difficult to do just that when using algorithmic decision-making instead of human judgment: using tools like COMPAS doesn't allow us to take context into account sufficiently, and it simultaneously obscures the extent to which underpinning concepts in our algorithmic model are subject to wide social and political disagreement.", "created_at": "2020-11-25 11:18:16.857534", "updated_at": "2020-11-25 11:18:16.857534", "tag_id": 1467, "post_id": 75832, "creator_id": 5479, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 13438}, {"id": 20210, "text": "", "quote": "Sam staram si\u0119 by\u0107 po prostu w zgodzie z w\u0142asnym sumieniem i rozs\u0105dkiem.", "created_at": "2020-07-07 10:32:21.126534", "updated_at": "2020-07-07 10:32:21.126534", "tag_id": 5852, "post_id": 60160, "creator_id": 6484, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 10660}, {"id": 20248, "text": "", "quote": "The App, which is being marketed as a voluntary download, alerts users when and for how long they have been in contact with someone who has tested positive for the virus.", "created_at": "2020-07-07 15:18:10.610982", "updated_at": "2020-07-07 15:18:10.610982", "tag_id": 5876, "post_id": 79137, "creator_id": 5059, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 13906}, {"id": 20264, "text": "", "quote": "The App \u2013 developed by the German government in collaboration with Apple, Google (using their \u201cprivacy-focused\u201d technology) and Deutsche Telekom AG (Germany\u2019s largest telecommunication company) \u2013 has received quite a lot of praise for its seemingly data-friendly solution (", "created_at": "2020-07-07 15:25:53.116602", "updated_at": "2020-07-07 15:25:53.116602", "tag_id": 5883, "post_id": 79137, "creator_id": 5059, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 13906}, {"id": 20363, "text": "", "quote": "Ahoj, celosv\u011btov\u00e1 sb\u00edrka - hust\u00fd!

Do her social networks include a lot of other people who recidivate? Some of those variables might be more appropriate to use than others, right? For instance, one might think it\u2019s inappropriate to make inferences from the behaviour of your friends and family whether you in fact will be guilty of criminal conduct again in the future. Some predictions might be more ethically and politically defensible than others. Similarly, we have to be attuned to the fact that even if you have a list of prior offences, that might be partially dependent on your social context, which we may want to consider as a mitigating factor. But it is often difficult to do just that when using algorithmic decision-making instead of human judgment: using tools like COMPAS doesn't allow us to take context into account sufficiently, and it simultaneously obscures the extent to which underpinning concepts in our algorithmic model are subject to wide social and political disagreement.", "created_at": "2020-11-25 11:18:17.033534", "updated_at": "2020-11-25 11:18:17.033534", "tag_id": 5368, "post_id": 75832, "creator_id": 5479, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 13438}, {"id": 20374, "text": "", "quote": "P\u0159esto, \u017ee na Va\u0161em projektu vid\u00edm osobn\u011b na prvn\u00ed pohled jenom to poztivn\u00ed, cht\u011bl bych se zeptat, trochu trapn\u011b, ale jo, jestli jste u\u017e n\u011bjak jednali s vlastn\u00edkem/spr\u00e1vcem objektu (i proto, \u017ee ta bl\u00edzk\u00e1 \u017eelezni\u010dn\u00ed stanice mi Kliniku i p\u0159ipomn\u011bla)?
