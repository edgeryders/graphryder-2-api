Not for the obvious reasons; the show keeps delivering gruesome deaths and so many broken people you wonder if there will ever be a glimmer of hope. This makes Breaking Bad look like an 80s sitcom. We know what we are getting now.Instead, it is a storytelling problem we have to work ourselves through. The previous two episodes raised so many questions that we as viewers should have been entitled to some answers. None were delivered during this episode. Instead, it raised more questions for season 2.Over the last few years there have been far too many TV shows that drag on, that keep beating dead horses (or zombies, as it were) for the pure and simple reason of keeping viewers hooked and keeping that revenue stream flowing. I had hoped that the fact that the show's creator and runner, Brendan Clive-Jeff, has stated that there is already a three season arch written would mean that there would be a feeling of structure, even to the first season.
