Thinking about disagreement is, I think, very important when we think about design decisions linked to AI and machine learning. To give a concrete example, suppose that we are using algorithmic tools to predict the risk that a criminal offender will reoffend in the future. One such algorithm is called COMPAS\u2014a tool that various states in the US having been using for a few years now\u2014to determine whether an offender is \u2018high risk\u2019 or \u2018low risk\u2019, and that according to a well-known investigation by ProPublica, it was more likely to classify Black defendants as \u2018high risk\u2019 in comparison to similar white defendants. Of course, what it means to be a \u2018high risk individual\u2019 is subject to disagreement\u2014whether those who design algorithmic tools explicitly acknowledge that or not. Algorithms are not inherently neutral, because we still have to make conscious choices when we design systems, including choices influenced by implicit bias and stereotypes. Of course, we could try to approximate what riskiness in this context means by looking at things like: has this person committed previous offences? Is she in an unstable economic situation? Do her social networks include a lot of other people who recidivate? Some of those variables might be more appropriate to use than others, right? For instance, one might think it\u2019s inappropriate to make inferences from the behaviour of your friends and family whether you in fact will be guilty of criminal conduct again in the future. Some predictions might be more ethically and politically defensible than others. Similarly, we have to be attuned to the fact that even if you have a list of prior offences, that might be partially dependent on your social context, which we may want to consider as a mitigating factor. But it is often difficult to do just that when using algorithmic decision-making instead of human judgment: using tools like COMPAS doesn't allow us to take context into account sufficiently, and it simultaneously obscures the extent to which underpinning concepts in our algorithmic model are subject to wide social and political disagreement.", "created_at": "2020-11-25 11:21:27.447831", "updated_at": "2020-11-25 11:21:27.447831", "tag_id": 7535, "post_id": 75832, "creator_id": 5479, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 13438}, {"id": 20403, "text": "", "quote": "Ahoj Deniso, d\u00edky moc za sd\u00edlen\u00ed p\u0159\u00edb\u011bhu a za to, \u017ee sis k n\u00e1m na\u0161la cestu.

Thinking about disagreement is, I think, very important when we think about design decisions linked to AI and machine learning. To give a concrete example, suppose that we are using algorithmic tools to predict the risk that a criminal offender will reoffend in the future. One such algorithm is called COMPAS\u2014a tool that various states in the US having been using for a few years now\u2014to determine whether an offender is \u2018high risk\u2019 or \u2018low risk\u2019, and that according to a well-known investigation by ProPublica, it was more likely to classify Black defendants as \u2018high risk\u2019 in comparison to similar white defendants. Of course, what it means to be a \u2018high risk individual\u2019 is subject to disagreement\u2014whether those who design algorithmic tools explicitly acknowledge that or not. Algorithms are not inherently neutral, because we still have to make conscious choices when we design systems, including choices influenced by implicit bias and stereotypes. Of course, we could try to approximate what riskiness in this context means by looking at things like: has this person committed previous offences? Is she in an unstable economic situation? Do her social networks include a lot of other people who recidivate? Some of those variables might be more appropriate to use than others, right? For instance, one might think it\u2019s inappropriate to make inferences from the behaviour of your friends and family whether you in fact will be guilty of criminal conduct again in the future. Some predictions might be more ethically and politically defensible than others. Similarly, we have to be attuned to the fact that even if you have a list of prior offences, that might be partially dependent on your social context, which we may want to consider as a mitigating factor. But it is often difficult to do just that when using algorithmic decision-making instead of human judgment: using tools like COMPAS doesn't allow us to take context into account sufficiently, and it simultaneously obscures the extent to which underpinning concepts in our algorithmic model are subject to wide social and political disagreement.", "created_at": "2020-11-25 11:21:27.551426", "updated_at": "2020-11-25 11:21:27.551426", "tag_id": 7992, "post_id": 75832, "creator_id": 5479, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 13438}, {"id": 27171, "text": "", "quote": "Of course, we could try to approximate what riskiness in this context means by looking at things like: has this person committed previous offences?

What many people do not know is that fifty percent of American adults are currently in a facial recognition database that law enforcement has access to. These databases don't only include mugshots, they also include images from drivers\u2019 licenses. So, a huge part of the population is already assessable by facial recognition systems, here and now. In several American cities, including San Francisco, activists argued that they did not want their cities to deploy these tools, and subsequently, these cities decided to ban them. One primary concern was not only the fact that so many people are represented in those databases without having clear recourse mechanisms, so that there isn't a clear due process path for people who get assessed inaccurately by those facial recognition tools. A potential for mass surveillance obviously affects all citizens, but there is also a more specific, injustice-based concern that these kinds of tools have been empirically shown to be less accurate for people of colour.

There is no such thing as a \u2018purely technological issue\u2019\u2014technological choices are to some degree always political and ethical choices. Also, I think it\u2019s important for practitioners to bear in mind that ethical reflection is never a process that is done unilaterally, and it\u2019s never a process that is done, so to speak. We shouldn't approach AI ethics as something like a checklist. We should not think of ethics as a final \u2018quality control\u2019 check that we simply run once after we've developed a particular technology. We should have ethical goals in mind before we deploy, but we should also be very open to changing those ethical goals once we do deploy and once we see what effects that technology has in the world. Recall the problem of model-world interactions that I mentioned before: because of it, we might simply not foresee certain problems, we might not be able to accurately forecast the magnitude of problems, we might not be able to predict how different technological systems interact with each other, and we may not be able to accurately predict how humans change their behaviour once they know they are subject to algorithmic assessments. All of these problems require that we keep our ethical critique going, rather than approaching it as a static, one-time process.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n    Edit\n    Delete\n  \nNo Commentdiscrimination \u2192 racism\n  \n    \n    Edit\n    Delete\n  \nNo Commentdifferential impact\n  \n    \n    Edit\n    Delete\n  \nNo Commentsurveillance\n  \n    \n    Edit\n    Delete\n  \nNo Commentfacial recognition\n\n  \n    \n            \n            \n            \n                ethics\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                nuancing the debate\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                reframing priorities\n            \n        \n        \n      Cancel\nSave\n    \n    \n  \nAnnotate", "created_at": "2020-11-29 07:59:24.676813", "updated_at": "2020-11-29 07:59:24.676813", "tag_id": 4874, "post_id": 75832, "creator_id": 5479, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 13438}, {"id": 20510, "text": "", "quote": "propojit lidi, synchronizovat, p\u0159esv\u011bd\u010dit o smyslu a n\u00e1plni,", "created_at": "2020-07-10 23:32:21.257672", "updated_at": "2020-07-10 23:32:21.257672", "tag_id": 5999, "post_id": 64989, "creator_id": 6339, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 11686}, {"id": 20556, "text": "", "quote": "berl\u00ednsk\u00e9 zmrazen\u00ed cen n\u00e1jm\u016f na dal\u0161\u00edch 5 let - neomezuje vlastn\u00edky nemovitost\u00ed?!

There is no such thing as a \u2018purely technological issue\u2019\u2014technological choices are to some degree always political and ethical choices. Also, I think it\u2019s important for practitioners to bear in mind that ethical reflection is never a process that is done unilaterally, and it\u2019s never a process that is done, so to speak. We shouldn't approach AI ethics as something like a checklist. We should not think of ethics as a final \u2018quality control\u2019 check that we simply run once after we've developed a particular technology. We should have ethical goals in mind before we deploy, but we should also be very open to changing those ethical goals once we do deploy and once we see what effects that technology has in the world. Recall the problem of model-world interactions that I mentioned before: because of it, we might simply not foresee certain problems, we might not be able to accurately forecast the magnitude of problems, we might not be able to predict how different technological systems interact with each other, and we may not be able to accurately predict how humans change their behaviour once they know they are subject to algorithmic assessments. All of these problems require that we keep our ethical critique going, rather than approaching it as a static, one-time process.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n    Edit\n    Delete\n  \nNo Commentdiscrimination \u2192 racism\n  \n    \n    Edit\n    Delete\n  \nNo Commentdifferential impact\n  \n    \n    Edit\n    Delete\n  \nNo Commentsurveillance\n  \n    \n    Edit\n    Delete\n  \nNo Commentfacial recognition\n\n  \n    \n            \n            \n            \n                ethics\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                nuancing the debate\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                reframing priorities\n            \n        \n        \n      Cancel\nSave\n    \n    \n  \nAnnotate", "created_at": "2020-11-29 07:59:24.666731", "updated_at": "2020-11-29 07:59:24.666731", "tag_id": 7313, "post_id": 75832, "creator_id": 5479, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 13438}, {"id": 27262, "text": "", "quote": "Users report to  adapting  their speech when they communicate with Alexa, even on a very fine-grained level, so that Alexa will understand them.", "created_at": "2020-12-02 14:31:36.184325", "updated_at": "2020-12-02 14:31:36.184325", "tag_id": 8006, "post_id": 74497, "creator_id": 5059, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 13245}, {"id": 20649, "text": "", "quote": "Czy kto\u015b s\u0142yszy moje \u015bwi\u0119te oburzenie kiedy nie przynale\u017c\u0119 do \u017cadnej wsp\u00f3lnoty wyznaniowej?", "created_at": "2020-07-11 14:56:20.374168", "updated_at": "2020-07-11 14:56:20.374168", "tag_id": 5906, "post_id": 59207, "creator_id": 6484, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 10762}, {"id": 20650, "text": "", "quote": "Czy mo\u017cemy zaj\u0105\u0107 si\u0119 jako ludzka rodzina \u017cyciem a nie symbolami i ideami kt\u00f3re w przeciwie\u0144stwie do istot \u017cywych pozbawione s\u0105 czucia?", "created_at": "2020-07-11 14:56:29.494171", "updated_at": "2020-07-11 14:56:29.494171", "tag_id": 5822, "post_id": 59207, "creator_id": 6484, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 10762}, {"id": 20747, "text": "", "quote": "Governments can legitimize detention and violence.
