Time and again, European countries engage in solidarity protests (which they absolutely should), but they fail to turn that critical lens on themselves. Germany (where I grew up, was educated and which is the focus of my research) has major, ongoing xenophobic, racist and Islamophobic cultural practices and policies that it still hasn't addressed. At school, for example, there is also little mention of Germany's colonial history. \n\nSo, what should we do here? A LOT. For example: education reform that includes more and more critical discussion of (a) colonialism and its contemporary implications, (b) migration and diaspora communities, we need more action against right wing political parties that are on the rise across the continent and this needs to be paired with policy reform that (a) makes newcomers' access and inclusion within the economy and society faster and (b) takes the onus off of them to 'integrate' into our society \u2013 their perceived failure to integrate is often fuel for further xenophobic attacks (e.g. the countless attacks on refugee homes by right wing groups)\n\nWe need to mobilise international participation and support for the movement in the United States AND we have to confront the systems in our countries that are racist.\n\nImages from Berlin's so-called 'party protest' this weekend are case in point that there is a lot to be done https://www.dw.com/en/berlin-police-break-up-floating-party-protest/a-53652185\n\nPartiers floating on rafts along the Spree river and blasting techno music are not the images of solidarity we need right now, and holding up \"I can't breathe\" posters as you dance and drink on rafts makes for a hollow and frankly, tone deaf message.

It's deeply heartening to know that some people are taking these ideas seriously. The reason my post seems unusually well-developed is because in some ways it's happening already.\n\nThe idea of taxing carbon and distributing the proceeds of that tax equally to everybody as a 'carbon dividend' is well established and has extensive political and other support from across the political spectrum. It is the (Liberal) Canadian federal government's 'backstop' policy: it is supported by Exxon, Shell, Unilever and many other giant corporations (see https://www.clcouncil.org/founding-members/); it is supported by the (Democrat) California Leglislature and by the US Green Party; it is supported by James Hansen and many (possibly most) senior climate scientists, and by a wide variety of climate activist organisations from both the Right and the Left and neither/both (notably the Citizens' Climate Lobby - see https://citizensclimatelobby.org). Not least, carbon dividends are the defacto climate policy of the non-Trump, non-Tea Party GOP (see https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/07/science/a-conservative-climate-solution-republican-group-calls-for-carbon-tax.html).\n\nI chose Curbelo for my imaginary story because he is the leader of the Climate Solutions Caucus of the US Congress, which now includes 88 congressional representatives (44 Democrats and 44 Republicans) - over 20% of the US Congress (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Solutions_Caucus). While the Climate Solutions Caucus doesn't formally support carbon dividends, it was established by Citizens' Climate Lobby with Curbelo and so is saturated by that policy. Curbelo is also young, upcoming, anti-Trump and supports sane, bipartisan policies not only on climate but on immigration and other issues. I have no idea what his political ambitions are, but he would be a natural presidential candidate for the scientific, rational, responsible and genuinely conservative remainder of the US Republicans, and a realistic potential challenger to Trump. Whether such a challenge would succeed is, of course, another issue.\n\nIn terms of the wider picture of what I have called the 'Commoner Movement' in my story - that is also happening already to a certain extent. As you have an interest in these matters I am sure you are familiar with the emerging policy movements on Land Value Tax, QE for People and a Basic Income, and with growing interest in the concept of 'the Commons'. I have been immersed in these issues for five years now and engage almost daily with many of the key people involved, and I can assure you that there is plenty of evidence of overlap between them - in both the thinking (and actions) of the individuals involved, and in terms of the deeper philosophical and political-economic ideas. Three of these real, implementable policies (CD, LVT, and QE4P) are potential funding sources for the other (UBI) and this synergy is not completely unnoticed. Leading economic thinkers (Kate Raworth, Mariana Mazzucato, Francis Coppola, Steve Keen, Scott Santens, and many more) are already connecting these threads (at least in their private and social media conversations). Much of my time is spent encouraging these connections and trying to connect the silos of each individual policy movement under the organising concepts of the Commons and Raworth's Doughnut. You can find much more about my thinking on these matters from my website at www.grahamcaswell.com. \n\nFrom what I see, our world is ending. Most serious is climate change - and it may already be too late. Work/income disruption, housing costs and financial dysfunction are leading to the destabilising of politics and thus of our ability to even focus on our core, structural economic problems, never mind address them. And change depends on politics, politics is based on ideas and, in my opinion, these are the ideas that can save us. I think a structured process leading to a meeting/retreat of key figures can come up with a coherent political narrative (like Fredrich Hayek did with Mont Perlion). I also think such a coherent political narrative can be spread rapidly with a focused, coherent, contagious, professional and thus reasonably well-funded online effort.\n\nHowever there is absolutely no funding and support out there for such ideas and activities - especially outside of a very rarified formal academia. Personally I am in the process of trying to kill my passion for these endeavours and block my mind to the truths I know so that I can focus on getting whatever paid work I can to keep the electricity on and have some sort of social and self respect. It is easier to get funding to paint a mural about climate change than it is to work on the political-economics behind it. Grants are available to insure coastal holiday homes and to buy \u20ac100,000 electric cars - but none to work on and promote the core ideas behind why those grants are there in the first place. The bigger and more important the ideas, the less funding is available. And in my opinion none are bigger and more important than these. To me this is absolutely and utterly insane and shames everybody with spare money, and particularly those gatekeepers well paid to work on climate, homelessness, austerity and all the rest. But that's the blinkered, self-interested and risk-averse world we live in.\n\nMy apologies for the whinge. It comes from the feeling that I am wasting my time even talking about these issues when I should be focusing on unrelated paid work. This is not self-pity (I am luckier than most - I have secure housing and even live beside a beach!). But when faced with the multiple tradgedies in the news each day, the accelerating decay of our politics, and an awareness of the mass horrors to come, it strikes me as insane that the deep and core ideas behind it all are so irrelevant and ignored - especially in the practical ways (i.e. money) that count the most. I think it is a stupid, self-destroying, blinkered, idiotic and sheer waste.\n\nMy story about how we might live in 2068 and how we might get there is a positive one, but it is only one of the many futures we can choose for ourselves. All the pieces are there, waiting to be connected and expressed. If just a small fraction of a fraction of a fraction of the funding and support flowing to the symptoms were directed to the core causes and solutions I think we could have a real chance. But that's just my opinion.\n\nThank you very much for your response to my story and again, my apologies for the negativity. \n\nBest regards,\n\nGraham\n\nP.S. In terms of why US business currently supports carbon dividends and would support a candidate like Curbello, they do so because they recognise reality and see this carbon pricing policy as a way to keep the market free. This is also the reason for the substantial support by many rich and powerful business people for a Basic Income and, to a much lesser extent, for LVT and QE for People. These policies provide universal financial and other security for every man, woman and child while keeping the market free and within the 'safe space' of Raworth's doughnut. They support both the Left's core value of universal security and the Right's core value of freedom (especially market freedom). These policies are also firmly grounded in the universal value of equality of treatment for all.", "created_at": "2018-09-26 11:51:07.772824", "updated_at": "2018-09-26 11:51:07.772824", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1264, "wiki": false, "reads": 33, "score": 141.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [47567], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 51451, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 9575, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Perfect match for Volkan - I need to finally make him write about his business here!", "created_at": "2019-03-07 15:48:35.487920", "updated_at": "2019-03-07 15:48:35.487920", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 15, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 52.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 63886, "user_id": 3092, "topic_id": 11309, "post_number": 13, "raw": "And this might also be interesting for the Reef project!\n[https://environnement.brussels/news/be-sustainable-une-nouvelle-plateforme-pour-les-quartiers-durables-bruxelles](https://environnement.brussels/news/be-sustainable-une-nouvelle-plateforme-pour-les-quartiers-durables-bruxelles)\n\nLe mar. 12 nov. 2019 \u00e0 14:00, Chantal Vanoeteren <chantal.vanoeteren@gmail.com> a \u00e9crit :", "created_at": "2019-11-12 13:46:51", "updated_at": "2019-11-12 13:50:39.866761", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 54, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 21.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [63728], "is_liked_by": [2536], "is_private": false}, {"id": 64275, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 11309, "post_number": 17, "raw": "Guys, so the call today did not happen.

This is the trickiest part, because I cannot do it alone, not even close. This is because I still have no idea how this would work. @chantal_vanoeteren, this seems to be something for you: can you produce a step-by-step model of how a former industrial building is re-classified as residential? For example: step 1, an architect produces a reconversion plan with certain characteristics of access to natural light, fresh air, fire exits etc. Step 2: an application is submitted  (to whom?). Step 3, the application is approved (how long does it normally take?), and so on. This, I believe, also interacts with the *contrat de quartier*, which seems to be a process where zoning and reclassification of real estate gets called into question and rediscussed. Think of this model as a flow chart. \n* A **call to action**. I propose this is \"let's sign a 'light' MOU to explore how we could go forward in the future\".

Our notes are below, as well as the person specification for the ethnographers.\n\n\n## Multi-lingual ethnographic coding role specification\n\nPopulist themes resonate with a part of the European population. To people who reject populism, this resonance can be hard to understand and empathise with, as it seems at odds with the observed long-term trends towards societal prosperity and openness. Conversely, people who find populism attractive cannot reconcile what they perceive with the optimistic narrative of their political adversaries. Edgeryders is co-conducting a research project on populism in Europe, convening a participatory online conversation to learn what the rise of populist politics looks like from the point of view of Europeans living their daily lives. The project is a structured effort to listen to the voices of people on the ground, providing a breakdown of populism that encodes the point of view of the people directly affected by it, both  supporters and opposers.\n\nPOPREBEL is looking to hire ethnographers to collaborate with us on this project. This would run for about three years (January 2019 - August 2021), on a part-time basis. We have a total budget of XXX Euro.\nSkills:\n\n* Familiar with the theory and practice of ethnography.\n* Comfortable with online ethnography.\n* Experience with qualitative data analysis, specifically qualitative coding. The software is unimportant as we have our own, which you will learn. \n* Ability to collaborate with other ethnographers coding the same dataset in different languages.\n* Flexibility and willingness to engage in productive dialogue around coding decisions--- good communication skills are a must. \n* Good knowledge of English as well as one of the following languages: Polish, Czech, or Serbo-Croatian.\n\nTasks:\n\n* Code the conversations, using a tool we built in-house called Open Ethnographer. \n* Build an ontology of relevant codes, appropriate to ethnographic coding of the online conversation, and keep a detailed and organised codebook.\n* Collaborate with other ethnographers to maintain a consistent multi-language coding ontology. \n* Help to compile an ethnographic report at the conclusion of the project.\n* Participate in the discussion towards improving both Open Ethnographer and the SSNA methodology.\n\nThe kind of qualitative coding we do has an added element to it: we use the codes to build a social semantic network, mixing ethnography and network science to produce a visualisation of the convened conversation. Thanks to the ethnography, now edges carry information about the meaning of interactions. This method of inquiry preserves the richness of conversation but provides some hard quantitative measures. With social semantic network analysis (SSNA), we can identify networks of codes, and measure their cohesiveness; identify emergent networks of specialists, who interact around specific keywords; and validate individual contributors, among other applications (to learn more, see: https://edgeryders.eu/t/semantic-social-network-analysis-the-video/7939).\n\nAs part of the role, you can also use the ethnographic/SSNA data to produce publications. \n\nWorkplace:\n\n* You can do the work online, from wherever you are, but you will be requested to participate in one or more physical meetings. Your travel expenses for these meetings will be covered by POPREBEL.\n\n* If you happen to be in Brussels, you can also come to the Reef, but that's not a requisite. We coordinate and communicate through the Edgeryders platform.\n\nTo apply: write to INSERT CONTACT. Include:\n\n* A short motivation letter, explaining why you want to do this and why you think you can deliver. \n* A CV.\n\n\n## Overarching Ethnographic team specifications\n\n* Two projects double the size of OPENCARE each \u2192 with other language fora = approximately 1.3 OPENCARE\u2019s for ethnographic coding\n* POPREBEL starts in January 2019\n* Platform live in March 2019\n* Coding as soon as tech appears on the platform - keep abreast of the posting\n* NGI Forward will begin in early 2019, exactly when to be confirmed.\n\n\n## POPREBEL\n\n* UCL (Jan), UB, CUNI 5PMS across community management and ethnographic coding \n* = 2.5PMS each Task = 10% one person\u2019s time over 24 months = about 5hrs/ week over 2yrs\n* = 1 person in Polish 10% of their time + 1 person in Czech 10% of their time + 1 person in Serbo Croatian 10% of their time\n* **How much of the corpus do they want focused on each language/ context?\n* Is that enough for coding those languages?\n* What percentage of the dataset will be in each language?\n* Will that be enough hours for the other coders - eg. if we have a surplus of Polish posts. Need to plan for the event that we were to have for more in the other languages. \n* NB. Allocate less to Amelia to allow for engaging extra coding time on other languages if need be\n* Include in person specification for other languages that more coding for more time/money may be possible, so under \u201cideal\u201d specifications the person would have time to take on a bit more should we end up having large amounts of posts in their language on the platform. If not we can hire another person to work in that language, but this is the less ideal option. \n* If the coders are already researchers on the topic there may be spill in terms of their own research time. \n* Amelia - team lead/ontology + English coding + liaison on recruitment + report\n* Coding and lead 20% over 24 months + Ontology 10% over 20 months \n* Report 20% over 6 months\n* Right now sufficient and has capacity\n* Has to be in the thick of the coding to be able to build the ontology\n* How are you going to train and mentor them? Your needs?\n\n    * Academy course + kick off meeting\n    * Travel budget to have an in-person training meeting as coding kicks off (three language coders + Amelia to Reef)\n    * 1-2 days\n    * Establish coding practices, meet, graphryder demo etc.\n\n * Bi-weekly check-ins (every other week) \n\n**Objectives of T 2.3**\n\n* Code participant-generated content as it unfolds on the POPREBEL platform. By \u201ccoding\u201d, we mean the ethnographic sense of the word, \u201citeratively tagging to identify core themes in the conversation\u201d. Goals: the conversation coded in full at month 33.\n\n* Maintain a consistent multi-language and multimedia coding ontology across the project. Goal: each code in each language has exactly one equivalent in each of the other languages.\n\n**Description of Work Task 2.3 (Involved: EDGE, UCL, CUNI, BE. Months 6-30)**\n\n* We code the POPREBEL conversation in-platform. The edgeryders.eu platform, which hosts POPREBEL, comes with an application called Open Ethnographer, which does just that.\n\n* Ethnographers work in teams to ensure intercoder reliability, and report regularly.\n\n* This is done using strategies from Grounded Theory [Corbin & Strauss, 2008] to minimize the impact of researchers\u2019 pre-conceived ideas about data, while acknowledging that no \u2018neutral\u2019 or \u2018depersonalized\u2019 coding reg-\nimen can exist.\n\n* As we code, we produce and maintain a multi-lingual ontology of codes applied to POPREBEL\u2019s conversation.\n\nThis takes the form of a regularly updated wiki containing the list of codes in use; their definition; and their equivalent in each of the other POPREBEL languages.\n\n**Milestones and deliverables**\n  \nD2.3 Month13 Ontology, first version\nMS 2.5 Month 32 Coding finished\nD2.5 Month 32 Ontology, second version\nD2.6 Month 34 Report: an ethnography of European populism\n\n\n## NGI Forward\n\n* Other language coding\n\n    * French, Italian, Polish & German - 4 x language ethnographers each 10% over 24 months = 5hrs/ week over 2years\n\n* Amelia - team lead/ontology + English coding + recruitment of team + report\n\n    * Coding and lead 20% over 24 months + Ontology 10% over 20 months \n    * Report 20% over 6 months (feeds into other Policy Lab and NGI Visions)\n    * Not sure if there\u2019s a middle ground - ready to go full steam ahead. Is there a back up plan? \n    * --> Yearly contracts so can reassess each year\n    * Committed to lead the Ethnographic team and would hand over English coding and ontology if need be\n\n(Ethnographic coding and net / data analysis - @anique.yael need to separate out as different tasks)                \n\n**T2.4:Induce, visualize and analyse the semantic social network from the conversation [M1-M36] Partner(s): Edgeryders (Task leader), Aarhus University, DELab**\n                        \nMotivation for the task: To make the most of the wisdom and knowledge contained in the contributions to the NGI Forward conversation, we turn them into structured data and subject them to analysis. We do this by coding participant-generated content, discussions and debates as they unfold on the platform, enabling us and other participants to easily find previous conversations and connections, and collecting core insights from these conversations into an interactive quali-quantitative data visualisation, insights from which will directly flow into the articulation of our NGI Vision.\n                        \nWork plan: We code participant-generated content as it unfolds on the NGI Forward platform. By \u201ccoding\u201d, we mean the ethnographic sense of the word, \u201citeratively tagging to identify core themes in the conversation\u201d. We code the conversation in-platform, using our built-in application Open Ethnographer, Ethnographers work in teams to ensure intercoder reliability, and report back regularly. To ensure consistency, we maintain a consistent multi-language coding ontology across the project, with as our aim ensuring each code in each language has exactly one equivalent in each of the other languages . We visualise the data with an interactive dashboard built on Graphryder. This allows us to visualise conversations and strong connections, drilling down on specific topics (\u2018ethno codes\u201d) of interest.\n                        \nPartners role: This task will be led by Edgeryders, with partners consulted for topic and language advice when needed.\n\nRelationship with other tasks: Tagging content allows us to analyse in depth the conversations generated on the platform, building on the debates facilitated in T2.1 and T2.2. Analysis will flow into T2.5, will directly inform the final NGI white paper (T6.8) and future scenario building (T2.1).\n                        \n**Deliverables**\n\nD2.2 [Month 13] Coding ontology, first version\nD2.4 [Month 32] Coding ontology, second version    \nD2.5 [Month 34] Report: The collective intelligence of a human-centric NGI \n\n**Milestones** \n\nMS2.3 : Coding finished Month 32", "created_at": "2018-08-29 10:28:59.678337", "updated_at": "2019-03-08 15:20:07.637793", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1660, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 193.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3904, 4022], "is_private": false}, {"id": 72772, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 12953, "post_number": 13, "raw": "Absolutely! \n\nAs said we also talked a bit about how to make it into a discord game.

In fact it is *the* regulation, the nuclear trigger under the finger of antitrust authorities, [since 1890](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act_of_1890#Monopoly). The concept is that of \"dominant position\". Once a company attains a dominant position in a market, it can be forced to break up into smaller companies. This is what happened under the Carter administration in America to AT&T (\"Ma Bell\"), forced to decompose into regional companies (\"Baby Bells\"). That does not happen by chance, or divine intervention, but by a court applying a piece of legislation.\n\n2 is nationalization, and also requires regulation. 3 is just a solution applied after 1. \n\nI asked \"how to do it\" because antitrust regulation evolved in a state context. It is not clear if, say, a German court, could order Facebook (an American company) dismantled. It could, in theory, forbid it to operate on the German market, but that would require a Great Firewall of Germany or some non-existent technology. At the very least there would be some creative implementation to do, even if the political will could be found.\n\n[quote=\"matthias, post:2, topic:9797\"]\nlet\u2019s get rid of advertising altogether, both online, in print, on TV and in public space, whether for products or political parties.\n[/quote]\n\n\nFor this to be viable, we need a clearer idea of how it would work.

I don't know anyone with that particular mix, but I do have close friends - half Romanian/ half Hungarian - who moved to Scotland in search of a life with more opportunities.. but only because they have Hungarian citizenship as well, which appears to be more valuable if you want to work there. As a Romanian you have all sorts of restrictions and you end up doing menial jobs only, sometimes illegally. And I know that it's much harder to find a well-paid or decent job if you're an educated immigrant in Scotland, unless you know somebody who is Scottish and can help. do you agree.. ? do you think this happens pretty much anywhere or is Scotland not so friendly at a first glance?\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2011-12-05 16:19:35", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:55.025717", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 283, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 55340, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 10131, "post_number": 15, "raw": "Id go with tell us about you.", "created_at": "2019-06-18 07:09:32.237650", "updated_at": "2019-06-18 07:09:32.237650", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 7, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 37.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [55184], "is_liked_by": [1856, 3206], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9257, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 2568, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>THANK YOU!!!</b>\n\nAre you guys posting the slides somewhere?\u00a0\n\nI've started to put up WORKING OUT LOUD blogposts before the beginning of every week to let people know what we will be working on and how they can get involved.

We could, instead, build a system that goes from the particular to the general:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\"A snippet of text\" <code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">refers to</code> a <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">tag</code>.</li>\n\n<li>A <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">tag</code> <code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\">refers to</code> another <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">tag</code>.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThat's it. There's no other level. You can build levels concatenating tags. Let's explore some use cases.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Use case 1: generalizing/making hierarchies</h3>\n\nThe researcher is tagging snippets that refer to <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">widgets</code> and <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">gadgets</code>. At some point, she realizes that widgets and gadgets have someting in common, they are both expressions of technology. She creates a tag <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">technology</code>, and refers to it the <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">widgets</code> and the <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">gadgets</code> tags. Now we have a tag that both <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">widgets</code> and <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">gadgets</code> refer to \u2013 in this sense, a meta-tag. But in fact, it is is simply a tag: you could just as well assign snippets directly to <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">technology</code>, if they refer to expressions of technology other than widgets or gadgets. There are no meta-tags, just tags and relationships.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Use case 2: branching out</h3>\n\nThe researcher finds out that there are several snippets about technology that all refer to the same expression of tech: robots. She creates a <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">robots</code> tag, and refers it back to <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">technology</code>. This way, the coding file knows that all snippets coded <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">widgets</code>, <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">gadgets</code> or <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">robots</code> all inherit  <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">technology</code>. \n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Use case 3: collapsing</h3>\n\nThe researcher decides that, after all, there is really no difference between how respondents treat widgets and gadgets. Distinguishing the two does not really add any explanatory power to the study.

Overview <a name=\"chap-1\"></a>\n\nWe have arrived at a first, rough machine design, to be discussed / explored / improved. Note that this is still in the design / planning stage: no machine has been built yet, but we're close to that now as the planning work below is nearly finished.\n\n3D view of the structural parts (in the current state of the design work):\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/2/2b675ccbe07a880d115d433b1adc19abb2624ef2.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"690\">\n\nAnd a quick sketch of the machine parts and a description of their function:\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/2/27d2ea843c21e0024330a4dbf65444e018ddabef.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"309\">\n\nThe numbered parts and their function:\n\n1. **Feed funnel.** Coffee beans \"flow\" easily, so a simple funnel is enough to feed them in. No vibration is needed if the vertical tube after the funnel has a large enough diameter (50 mm is for sure enough). A grid sieve to keep out large foreign objects (such as branch pieces) is needed to protect the interior of the machine.\n\n2. **Slow conveyor.** The feed tube ends ca. 10 mm above a first conveyor belt. It is wide but moves slowly, moving 1-2 layers of beans.\n\n3. **Guide funnel.** Guides the beans to the center of the fast conveyor as they fall off the slow conveyor.\n\n4. **Fast conveyor.** To separate the beans, they fall off the slow conveyor onto a fast-moving one that is only wide enough for one bean at a time (assume 25 mm so there is enough space for the occasional foreign object, such as branch pieces). By moving faster and catching the falling beans from the slow one, beans will be spread out one after another on this conveyor. For a target of 100 beans per second and an average two-bean distance between beans, the speed of the conveyor would have to be 300 bean lengths per second, so 300 cm for an average bean length of 10 mm. 3 m/s is equivalent to 10.8 km/h. Might be too fast for a simple machine, in which case the capacity would be lower. But if we can achieve 100 beans / second this way, it would be equivalent to a throughput of 1.5 tons per day (see [here](/t/id/7122), section 4.2).\n\n5. **Linear solenoids.** They move sideways across the fast conveyor and have brushes attached to a lever by which they can move the beans into destination bins. This setup allows for any number of bins, unlike when directing the beans into an upper or lower bin when they fall off the end of the conveyor. In our case, we want three solenoids (of which only one is shown in the sketch). This allows four bins together with the end of the conveyor belt as final destination. Normal usage: (1) bad beans, (2) undecidable beans, (3) low-quality beans, (4) high quality beans.\n\n6. **Output funnel.** Guides the beans to one of the output bins. Similar to the bean guides after the solenoids, but this time for the end of the conveyor belt.\n\n7. **Camera.** Captures images of the beans while they are moving on the slow conveyor. An LED flasher will help to keep the images sharp even though the beans are moving with quite some speed.\n\nFor illustration, a 3D sketch of the path of the coffee beans through the machine:\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/8/8906d4a0f9272738491f75180179a069b05d8e34.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"283\">\n\nElectrical schematics for the coffee sorter by @mmajdeb (components roughly as in the side view drawing above):\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/0/0a5920b0cdaf006e27201a6866e672560a281b30.png\" width=\"400\">\n\n\n## 2. Usage  <a name=\"chap-2\"></a>\n\n**Programs planned for the \"version 1.0\" machine:**\n\n* **Standard program.** The standard program sorts coffee beans into \"bad, good and great\" coffee beans. There are multiple versions or configurations, accessibly form a menu and sorted by coffee plant variety, country and growing altitude. It uses a quick, color based decision algorithm (targeting 100 beans / second), which is adequate for \"normal commercial coffee\" but not as exact as it can be with the coffee sorter's hardware. This is the only program that will be available in the \"version 1.0\" machine, but \n\n* **Standard training program.** Training the machine with ones own beans will allow the most accurate sorting, but it needs manually sorted beans as input (good and bad ones) and some CPU time. A program on the Raspberry Pi will receive image data and calculate the configuration parameters for the color sorting algorithm.\n\n**Programs planned as later additions:** The coffee sorter is also able to run other programs for specialized purposes and higher requirements. We can think of at least the following, which will be prepared in the software architecture of the version 1.0 machine, but implemented later:\n\n* **Maximum accuracy sorting.** In contrast to the quick standard program that relies on color sorting, this program can also rely on an AI image classifier when unsure, or even exclusively, then using the AI image classifier for every bean. It would achieve a throughput of \u226410 beans per second; while that is much slower than the 100 beans per second of the color sorting algorithm, it is still acceptable as the people using it for this purpose can invest 3000 EUR to run 10 machines in parallel, again achieving 100 beans per second (equiv. 1.5 t/day).\n\n* **Training program for maximum accuracy sorting.** This is effectively about training a neural network model. It requires a network connection and a server (on the local network or the Internet) that will receive the image data and calculate the neural network model, then offering it for download. This cannot be done on the Raspberry Pi, as it would simply take too long. Using the server on the Internet will be free of charge, but in exchange the coffee bean images and the resulting model will be open source licensed.\n\n* **Flavor sorting.** This is a hypothetical use case: with some cupping experiments, it should be possible to train an AI image classifier to sort beans by flavor profile, using combinations of attributes / hints that are not obvious to the human eye.\n\n* **Size sorting.** In larger quantities, sorting by size will be done with sieves, but for small farms, the optical coffee sorter can easily take over that task as well. With its four outputs, it can separate three sizes and a remainder, which is then fed back in to separate out another three sizes and so on.\n\n**Serial operation.** When running a special program with many different output types (esp. size sorting), one can feed back the remainder into the same machine to separate out additional output types or (faster) feed it right into the input funnel of another, identical machine. The machine dimensions and the funnels will be designed to allow this.\n\n**Scaling.** The machine has a narrow format (only 5-10 cm wide), because the idea is to operate many machines in parallel if there is a need. All would be fed from the same feed tube, if necessary with a steep slope to cover longer distances. Similarly, the four outputs can be collected by parallel sloped tubes running under the bottom of these machines.\n\n**Redundancy.** Operating multiple machines in parallel has the advantage of high redundancy, as the machines operate independently. So when one machine breaks, one can simply keep operating the others without issue, while taking out and repairing the broken one and putting it back in. Of course the output will be lower while not all machines are active, but the idea with redundancy is that the highest capacity should be more than required. Redundancy is a better way to deal with failure than having a spare machine around: having a spare machine would need investment costs for twice the required processing capacity, while redundancy requires only (say) 120% processing capacity in the case of six mutually redundant machines. In addition, redundancy can deal with multiple failures (\"four of six machines broken\"), and when spare parts are not readily available, allows to combine broken machines with complementary defects into working ones.\n\n\n## 3. Bill of Materials <a name=\"chap-3\"></a>\n\n* **funnel assembly**\n\n    * **CNC cut parts**, plywood or plastic\n\n* **casing**\nWe want the casing (without the funnel) to fit inside a typical 600\u00d7400 mm [Euro container](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro_container) made from plastic. It will allow for simple and cheap transport on pallets, protect the machine during any transport and protect it during storage against rain, dust, humidity etc.. Due to the standardized [internal dimensions of Euro containers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro_container#Dimensions), the machine's side face should not exceed 540\u00d7360 mm in size. The width of the machine is rather unrestricted as Euro containers come in various heights. However, 10 cm width seems a reasonably achievable limit.\n\n    * **CNC cut parts**, plywood or plastic\n    * **nuts and bolts**, stainless steel\n\n* **upper conveyor assembly**\n\n    * **1 belt**, 25 - 75 mm wide\n    * **2 axles**, with bearings\n    * **1 stepper motor**, 5 V DC\nWe use a stepper motor instead of a simple DC motor to create more opportunities to improve the machine using better software. Among stepper motors, a 5 V motor seems best: they are readily available and can work with a cheap motor driver board without current limiting, such as the Adafruit 2348 board we have selected. And using 5 V products has the advantage that it can be the standard voltage of the machine, introduced by the requirement of the Raspberry Pi (\"[4.75 - 5.25 V](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/a/9584)\"). So we will only need one 5 V power supply for the whole machine, reducing costs.\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;Examples of suitable motors: Minebea 17PM-K031-02V ([here](https://www.ebay.de/itm/222694120610) and [here](https://www.ebay.de/itm/222830093841)), Nippon Pulse Motor PF35T-48 ([here](https://www.ebay.com/itm/271626108537)), generic 5 V / 416 mA stepper ([here](https://www.ebay.de/itm/132488486788)).\n    * **CNC cut parts**, plywood or plastic\n\n* **lower conveyor assembly**\n\n    * **1 belt**, 25 mm wide\n    * **2 axles**, with bearings\n    * **1 stepper motor**, 5 V DC\nA 5 V stepper motor seems best, see above.\n    * **CNC cut parts**, plywood or plastic\n\n* **gates assembly**\n\n    * **3 linear solenoids**, 5 V DC\nLinear solenoids are a common type of electromagnetic actuator ([introduction](https://www.electronicshub.org/electromagnetic-actuators/#Linear_Solenoid)). Among them, 5 V solenoids are quite common and cheap, and suitable for the light task here of \"just moving one coffee bean\". Using 5 V products has the advantage that it can be the standard voltage of the machine, introduced by the requirement of the Raspberry Pi (\"[4.75 - 5.25 V](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/a/9584)\"). So we will only need one 5 V power supply for the whole machine, reducing costs. Suitable example products: [1](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11015), [2](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2776), [3](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/_60294569928.html), [4](https://www.robotshop.com/en/5v-solenoid.html).\n    * **CNC cut parts**, plywood or plastic\n\n* **camera assembly**\n\n    * **1 camera**, UVC interface, not yet chosen, a camera for testing is available by using an Android phone and software that provides UVC access to its camera\n    * **1 LED flasher**, white LEDs, ca. 6000 K color temperature (\"cool white\"), for camera imaging of the coffee beans in motion. Current proposal is the [Adafruit 2433](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2433) DotStar LED Strip, or the same LEDs [bought individually](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2351) and mounted on [suitable breakout boards](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1762). In both cases, the LEDs are addressable, so can be individually dimmed and switched on / off. Communication with these DotStar LEDs uses 2-wire SPI, so does not create realtime requirements for the microprocessor. As controlling these LEDs seems simple, it seems a good capability of the machine. Because with the same technique, other additional LEDs could be added and controlled as well lateron, extending the lighting setup to multi-spectral and IR imaging.\n\n* **electronics**\n\n    * **1 AC adapter**, 5 V DC, \u22658 A, [Adafruit 658](https://www.adafruit.com/product/658) (25 USD)\nOnly one AC adapter is needed, as the whole machine will run on 5 V DC (Raspberry Pi, stepper motors, solenoid, camera. This reduces cost, complexity and points of failure. We currently have a \"Rydges SpeedPower 100-240 V to 5 V 2.5 A\" available that is sufficient for the Raspberry Pi, but will need a more powerful one for the whole machine: about 2.5 A for the Raspberry Pi incl. camera, 1 A per stepper motor, 1 A per solenoid. This power is normally never needed all at the same time, but over-dimensioning this does not hurt, as it makes the AC adaptor last longer.\n    * **1 Raspbery Pi 3**, available\n    * **2 motor driver boards**, I2C interface, [Adafruit 2348](https://adafru.it/2348) \"DC & Stepper Motor HAT for Raspberry Pi\", also known as \"Adafruit Motor HAT\" and \"Adafruit DC and Stepper Motor HAT\" ([see](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Motor-HAT-Python-Library)). Available.\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;These boards come with: [product info page](https://adafru.it/2348), [support page](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-dc-and-stepper-motor-hat-for-raspberry-pi/downloads), [manual](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/downloads/pdf/adafruit-dc-and-stepper-motor-hat-for-raspberry-pi.pdf), open source [PCB schematics](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-DC-Stepper-Motor-HAT-PCB), [Python library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Motor-HAT-Python-Library) (only depending on a GPIO library), [demo program in C#](https://github.com/adafruit/MotorHatDemo). There seems to be no C library, but Adafruit has a very similar board for Arduino (\"[Adafruit Motor Shield v2](https://adafru.it/1438)\"), which comes with a [C++ library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Motor_Shield_V2_Library).\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;The Adafruit 2348 motor HAT has no integrated current limiting, so it cannot be used with some types of stepper motors that require this. (Proof: The [manual](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/downloads/pdf/adafruit-dc-and-stepper-motor-hat-for-raspberry-pi.pdf) (p. 6) mentions that the board uses the TB6612 MOSFET driver. And in [another document](https://learn.adafruit.com/current-limiting-stepper-driver-with-drv8871/overview), Adafruit mentions that this chip has no current limiting.)\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;We intend to use these boards both for controlling the motors and the linear solenoids, instead of a relay board for the latter. This should be possible, as Adafruit [mentions](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-tb6612-h-bridge-dc-stepper-motor-driver-breakout/overview) for a board using the same TB6612 MOSFET driver that it can \"fire four solenoids, spin two DC motors or step one \u2026 stepper with 1.2A per channel\". After all, PWM output with 100% duty cycle is the same output as a relay would provide. Note that circuits with solenoids have to be protected against inductive kickbacks, but the TB6612 already includes built-in kick-back diodes (see [here](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/downloads/pdf/adafruit-tb6612-h-bridge-dc-stepper-motor-driver-breakout.pdf), p. 4) so no special protection has to be added.\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;One four-channel board is only enough for the two stepper motors, so we need two; the second would be able to fire up to eight solenoids (somehow). The advantage of two boards is redundancy (between machines) and fewer spare parts to organize. Also this way, there are several unused output channels for future uses or user-made changes. In addition, we get a MOSFET based design instead of relays, which should increase reliability by having fewer mechanical parts.\n\n\n## 4.

I left my hometown 14 years ago and I have been reconstructing my social world since then. I think the 'home bubbles' and the 'abroad bubbles' have always been fluid for me - 'home' and 'abroad' have blurry boundaries. Even in my darkest, least hopeful moments, when it felt like I didn't have a home anymore or a language that feels like home, I tried to remind myself that I left Romania for NYC because I was curious to learn about the world. This is also the reason for which I try to keep my bubbles porous - I believe that if I want to learn with others I cannot live in the comfort of a cozy space. My struggle has been to deconstruct ideas that society takes for granted - that 'home' needs to be a stable space, a comfortable one, a space of predictability and intimacy (hence my interest in co-housing). But most homes are not like that or, more accurately, they are like that only in the simplified narratives we create about them. From my experience, there is a lot of hard work involved in building a home both 'at home' and 'abroad'. So, it is this hard work of making a home that keeps me sane because I know that, if I am honest with myself, wherever I go I will have to engage in it. This realization has saved me from cultural shocks and the disappointment with old or new friends. Of course, some days it feels easier to fall back on given narratives about homes and homelands...but those days pass. More difficult is losing friends because of such relocations in space but then again friendships are dialogues and some dialogues end or morph into something else.

From thinking through my experiences with coding + analysis in Open Care and working with Nermine on Open Village, I want to propose we push further into the open notebook science terrain that we have been discussing since the beginning of Open Care. @Alberto and I had a discussion this morning to explore the idea further. \n\nI think that the key to keeping the coding standardised, accessible, and transparent is to have an **open codebook** that all ethnographic coders commit to updating systematically and regularly. This creates 1) a way of ensuring rigorous coding and 2) keeps ethnographers working on the project accountable to one another.  \n\nTraditionally, all ethnographers coding their data keep a codebook. But this codebook is usually kept private, often on pen and paper, and doesn\u2019t get published alongside the final product. Asking an anthropologist for her field notes or codebook, in usual disciplinary practice, would be strange. Further, as ethnography is usually a solo pursuit, the ethnographer only has to make the codebook make sense to herself. Instead, I propose a codebook that remains open throughout the coding process, attentively updated by the ethnographic coders and an object around which frequent discussions of coding choices can occur. \n\nSo what is a codebook? It is a living document that helps the ethnographer document and keep track of her coding decisions.\n\nFor each code, the following should be included in the codebook : \n\n1. **brief description** - the name of the code itself \n2. **detailed description** - a 1- 3 sentence description of the code\u2019s qualities or properties\n3.  **inclusion criteria** - conditions that merit the code \n4. **exclusion criteria** - exceptions or particular instances that do not merit the code \n5. **typical exemplars** - a few examples of data that best represent the code\n6. **atypical exemplars** - extreme or special examples of data that still represent the code \n7. **\"close, but no\"** - data examples that could mistakenly be assigned this particular code\n8. **similar codes** - if this code doesn\u2019t fit, what other codes might be useful instead? \n\n(5 and 6 are useful but since OE can auto-list examples of a code, may not be entirely necessary if we need to keep it more simple. At least 5 may not be.)\n\nFor our project, we can add:\n\n9. This code in other languages (linked)\n\nCodebooks also include memos, which are brief descriptions capturing the ethnographer\u2019s thought process in using the code. As Glaser (1978: 83) puts it:\n\n> \u2018(A memo is) the theorizing write-up of ideas about codes and their relationships as they strike the analyst while coding... it can be a sentence, a paragraph or a few pages... it exhausts the analyst\u2019s momentary ideation based on data with perhaps a little conceptual elaboration\u2019 \n\nMemos help the ethnographer keep track of her thoughts during the coding process. They are immensely useful in later stages of qualitative analysis when trying to theorize about the data, like when we will be writing up reports at the conclusion of the project. They help the ethnographer:\n\n* remember connections she made off the cuff,\n* formulate alternative hypotheses to those she made before, \n* propose new codes or question existing ones (especially in cases when not confident enough to want to make a change then and there), \n* integrate thoughts notated in previous memos or field notes, \n* help formulate or articulate concepts that are not yet fully-formed enough in her mind\n* help her future self or other researchers make sense of her choices. \n\nThe last point is crucial for our purposes --- keeping these kinds of memos in the codebook will help immensely when trying to undertake collective ethnographic coding. \n\nExamples of memos: \n**memo 1**: used `ship speed` since Luke was talking about outrunning other ship in Millennium Falcon\n**memo 2** : changed `ship speed` to `insufficient ship speed` to be more precise since there were negative complaints about the Millennium Falcon\u2019s speed.\n**memo 3**: I think it\u2019s possible that Han is trying to establish dominance through sarcasm and bravado, but is actually intimidated by Luke\u2019s undetermined powers. Luke seems oblivious to this dynamic but concerned with the group\u2019s survival. \n\n\nThe Open Ethnographer course goes into a lot more detail on ethnographic coding, so do let me know if this doesn\u2019t make enough sense and I can add information to explain further!\n\nLooking forward to continuing the experiment :)", "created_at": "2018-07-23 10:17:30.968549", "updated_at": "2019-09-11 15:20:03.860314", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 753, "wiki": false, "reads": 20, "score": 739.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3904, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 64909, "user_id": 5209, "topic_id": 11678, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hi all, \n\nNext week is the yearly Internet governance forum (IGF) in Berlin, where I co-organized a panel on AI ethics on Thursday from 11.45 until 13.15. \n\nThe panel is entitled: \"Beyond Ethics Councils - how to really do AI governance\" please drop by if you're also at the IGF! would be great to meet you IRL.

Needless to say, certain strategies are more valuable than others.\n\nOne might say that theories will always be theories\u2026 and when positive, usually with a positive impact in practice.

It seems to be that EdgeRyders is **doing** precisely what the doughnut theory speaks about: transforming action towards a more holistic approach.\n\nAlthough theoretical, experts increasingly recognise the thinning lines between society, economics and the environment. There is an active dialogue questioning the application of conventional economics, and whether it is time to rethink previous theories. Even radically - such as Piketty does (haven\u2019t read his stuff myself but came across the article https://www.wired.co.uk/article/thomas-piketty-capital-ideology).\n\nWith regards to the doughnut theory, it has been introduced in Amsterdam, as a tool for transformative action.

And you know how sometimes you're so far from the normal idea of home that you have a hard time understanding just *how* far? I don't even distinguish between nuclear family home and co-housing as a home, because this is not where the action is imho (even thogh it could be a crucial distinction for many, and rightly so). I think it comes down to the heart, in the sense of feeling of belonging, no matter how the home setup looks like. That was hard to rebuild after I left Cluj for good, simply because I had thought I belong there, because my people were there. Only to realise that having 2 homes is even more rewarding, feeling safe and at ease in two places, or more. But in the absence of this feeling, a sense of wondering the world would not do it, not for me. It does work for @natalia_skoczylas and others though. Maybe because you two and others are more at ease at engaging with the places you're in. \n\n@Nadia made this comment of your 'community of fate' being very much tied to land and rituals. I find it very interesting as well, this deep attachment:\n\n> How these narratives can carry people through rough times due to a sense of being a community of fate. The rituals, again tied to place and people, which everyone of the place has internalised often have the role of weaving together communities. The older they are, the more thoroughly they are grounded in your person - because of childhood memories etc. A solid common ground.

It's mostly dormant, we don't do much with it beyond using it as a kind of address book. Some of us try to find jobs there, and some of us maaaybe post status updates. But linkedin can be a powerful platform for drawing people and opportunities towards whatever it is one is doing. **Here's how we have been using it for Edgeryders activities, via the personal accounts of individuals who sign up to do so...**\n\nWe search for possible participants using key words through the whole Linkedin database (Premium feature) and invite them via personalised automated message system to the specific initiative. We follow their (positive) responses via email template which directs them to the dedicated form on the platform. There they can register for the event and meet the Edgeryders at the same time. Following the initiative, we contact them and propose the follow-up meeting to discuss possible collaborations.\n\n#### Good for you\nIt is a great way to grow your network and start conversations with people that might lead to new opportunities for you. Because you are bringing something of value to the table ( invitation to a high quality event or content, relevant to their interests). And have a context to follow up and develop that relationship. The key here is to only do this for events and content on topics that really interest you.\n\n#### Good for everyone\nThen better we collectively get at amplifying conversations, topics and activities at a low cost - the better we can leverage this to support the kind of things we feel are important, including our own personal projects.\n\n## How to get started\n\n1. Open the **Chrome** browser.\n2. Login to your **Linkedin** account.\n3. Upgrade to a **Premium Linkedin** account - **Sales Navigator Pro** option (you get a free month).\n4. Download and install **Dux Soup** browser plugin in your **Chrome** browser (you have to pay for this feature, remember to keep the receipt to get the reimbursement from us).\n5. Use **Linkedin**'s premium search function ( the sales navigator one) to look for relevant profiles. The search engine allows you to really set a specific profile from industry, keyword, geographic location, role/level of seniority, size of organisation etc.\n\n![Capture d\u2019e\u0301cran 2020-10-16 a\u0300 10.54.00|690x403](upload://mZpyn0C8f38qZikV6RMLKgCLtqI.png) \n![Capture d\u2019e\u0301cran 2020-10-16 a\u0300 10.54.30|690x395](upload://qs8GpK9KSOjqisvqmD2banHY5tq.png) \n\n# The easy part, let a robot do the work for you\n\nWe use the  Dux Soup browser plugin to automate the process of sending connect requests because it efficiently personalises each message. Here is how:\n\n1. Make sure you are on the page of the search results\n2. Click on the duxsoup plugin in your browser. \n3. There you will see the option to **visit & connect**.  In the text field you put an invitation to connect containing a link which directs them to the event info. To be truly effective it is better to include a request for their email so that you can send them a more personalised follow up invitation via email. You can see it in the example below\n\n![Capture d\u2019e\u0301cran 2020-10-16 a\u0300 10.52.25|690x292](upload://57JbGwjgbPeRRhj4BHFogXPjjzb.png) \n\n# Follow up is key!\nYou should check your message inbox on a regular basis to see who has gotten back in touch and then follow up with them:\n\n* **Send them a personalised email** - The best way is to create a standard text that you copy paste into each one, then personalise by adding their name in the beginning (Dear ...,).\n* **Tell them you emailed them** in linkedin message - otherwise you risk that they dont see it because we are all drowning in email, stuff ends up in spam etc.\n* **Download this contact management template** for keeping track of who you have been in touch with: [Contact Management Template.ods|attachment](upload://fTzBVHgnxyeMPCj0U3Uq9fmOFuA.ods) (15.2 KB) \n* Inform them on **Linkedin/Sales** messenger with a[ standard message]\n*  While doing this, read what they are actually saying in their answers and respond to legitimate questions properly.\n* **Repeat the follow up every few days** to stay in the loop\n\n## Urgh, I dont have time for all this follow up work - what can I do?\n\n* **Make sure your event info or content page is set up as an edgeryders form** like this example https://tell.edgeryders.eu/14599  ( see [instructions for how to set up a form](https://edgeryders.eu/t/using-edgeryders-forms/14230/19))\n* **Do not add request for email in the duxsoup automated message** - only direct them to the tell page for the event or activity.\n\n### Why is it good? \n\nBecause through the edgeryders form, people who register for an event or sign up for a newsletter/activity/whatever will at the same time be redirected to one place on the edgeryders platform dedicated to the event, where it is easy for the community managers and rest of the team to answer questions etc so you don't have to.\n\nCollect the emails from the people that have registered on the platform using [the query for it](https://edgeryders.eu/g/moderators/reports/30).\n\nSend them a final message with the **Edgeryders Zoom** coordinates or whatever it is you are inviting them to.

Maybe I wasn't clear, sorry about that. I meant that, at least for me, it's not this that will make more of a home or not, it's really the people. Yes, we need to expand on our narratives of home and re-shape those which are currently not working because they contribute to isolation, and all the things you say. But for me what was an unexpected admission was that my home is in people, not in any land per se or arbitrary house setup. So that comes after, rather than being a prerequisite. It's like the basic level of Maslow's pyramid, but layered for what makes a safe and loving home.\n It's also why I notice that some people can move out of their land or country courageously when they follow dear ones. It's like taking their soul home with them..\n\nSo what @Olimpia says about challenging the idea that '\u2018home\u2019 needs to be a stable space, a comfortable one, a space of predictability and intimacy'  - it's a little more difficult for those of us wired for safety and intimacy as a basis for anything else.", "created_at": "2019-11-16 09:43:51.859915", "updated_at": "2019-11-16 09:48:00.083073", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 221, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 27.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [64310], "is_reply_to": [64310], "is_liked_by": [5257], "is_private": false}, {"id": 65620, "user_id": 4861, "topic_id": 11863, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Welcome!

I still don't know if I have been accepted to the brainstorming tomorrow, but am in Brussels at the moment so hope to meet you all.       \n\n**Who I am**\n\nJorge was born into a family of artisans and salespeople in Puerto Rico, studied to be a diplomat in Washington DC, and came of age during the 2008 global crash and the rise of the digital economy. For the past 8 years I have worked as an ethnographer and strategist, for clients in places like S\u00e3o Paulo, Lyon, Guangzhou, and Jeddah. The output varied, but most projects have involved understanding emerging systems and behaviors, often demystifying the technologies and cultural context underpinning them. This has always been guided by actively supporting communities that foster social justice, freedom of expression and democratic mobilization - such as Fearless Cities North America, The Feast, and Digital Democracy. A moment of reckoning two years ago led me to Berlin to co-found Coliga, a values-led startup offering infrastructure for freelancers, cooperatives, and de-centralized organizations. I\u2019m currently focused on supporting projects innovating food systems  and food culture, as well as health - including mental and sexual health.\n\n\n**Why I'm interested in Science Fiction Economics Lab** \n\nAs a design researcher and activist, [I\u2019ve always incorporated Science Fiction into my work](http://www.thehumanandmachine.com/podcast/science-fiction-and-apps/) and the use of speculative methods to reveal narratives to guide us. Recently, I\u2019ve become preoccupied with the experiencing and sensing of the future - not just thinking about it was rational modeling but also subconscious somatism - as an integral part to fight the dystopia and provoke change. This is informed by my role in leading recovery efforts in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, and thinking of how to spark bold thinking in the middle of a crisis. In a larger frame, it directly related to piloting alternatives that might help us avert or minimize the worst of climate collapse and the domino effect in politics and society.Given that these topics all relate to the way people derive livelihoods, consume resources, and create well-being - in essence, economics - I\u2019m interesting in speculating on what these responses might be and even piloting some of them.\n\n\n**Areas of interest to work on** \n\nThere are two themes areas that I\u2019m interested in, within the context of my current research on peripheries and edges: developing work around black/grey economies and the spaces/institutions they operate in or around of. \n\n**Townsquares of the post-collapse**\n> Many depictions of the world post-crisis are famous for how the portray the post-collapse order, often responding to tropes of the Wild West or the Medieval period: the tavern owners, the blacksmith/technologist recovering leftover technology, the doctor making do. What can we learn about the institutions and archetypes that live on in the collective imaginary of the post-apocalypse?\n\n**The Smugglers** \n> Many sci-fi stories hinge on the figure of the \u2018smuggler\u2019 - the person operating in the grey zones between authorities, safe zones, or inhabited areas.  political economy around key \u2018smugglers\u2019 (including pirates and bandits) in science fiction lore, and attempt to understand the role attributed to \u2018black markets\u2019 and \u2018outlaw\u2019 areas within the context of future economies.\n\nFurthermore, and in line with the frame of experiencing the future, I\u2019m keen in working to transform or present any research or paper through a variety of media, from performances and installations to speculative exercises. For example, my most recent work was a two-week art residency called [Peripheral Intuitions](https://night-embassy.com/ambassador/peripheral-intuitions) in Berlin. In short, it was an attempt to model alternatives to the present and the future through art, workshop, and healing experiences.", "created_at": "2019-11-11 11:47:59.761989", "updated_at": "2019-11-11 11:51:14.256221", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 624, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 58.6, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 315, 5698], "is_private": false}, {"id": 73696, "user_id": 5667, "topic_id": 13134, "post_number": 8, "raw": "I join you tomorrow as well, so we see how to go further with it.", "created_at": "2020-04-06 10:37:57.687580", "updated_at": "2020-04-06 10:37:57.687580", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 15, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 46.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [73687], "is_liked_by": [4096, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 36485, "user_id": 3402, "topic_id": 704, "post_number": 39, "raw": "Till now I focused to build the team and our meeting place.

More collective forms of dwelling have their own histories. So, while I agree with you that 'home is in people' and with @johncoate that 'home is where the heart is', I would still add that home - as a feeling, a physical space, a social landscape - is built in relation to one or more societies (from which we leave, where we arrive). This is why I said that we need to deconstruct, to challenge our understandings of home, intimacy, safety. In order to stay sane we never simply deconstruct, we also build with others homes, but the exercise of deconstruction is important because it shows us why we choose to live in a particular way; it also renders the work necessary to live like that visible and more valuable.

What I do have is some personal memories that stretch back quite a bit, as I am fairly old. So, I remember the other side of this debate when I was an undergraduate student, back in the late 1980s. People then looked at academics, and found a lot of entrenchment. Once hired, academics were unfireable. The top layer of researchers stayed mobile, moving from one prestigious university to the next in order to find new stimuli and new collaborators; but, if you were a student in a peripheral university in, say Italy (Camerino? Bari?), chances were, your teachers had been in the same department for 10-25 years, and they would teach you what they saw fit to teach, with no accountability whatsoever. You just had to hope that they would be fairly up-to-date, reliable at office hours, reasonably interested in talking to you. If not, tough luck. Especially the senior ones were *really* entrenched. People called them \"baroni\", the barons. And since you got in there by co-optation, getting a job as a professor was very much about swearing fealty to one of these academic feudal lords. They would get you a job (very eventually) by making a deal with fellow barons: I upvote your flunkie in the competition, you upvote mine. The system was felt to be rotten and overdue for some disruption. This is the *only* reason why I myself, after taking a good look, decided not to go into academia. My friends that did become professors (in economics), they all had to migrate, get to somewhere where academic jobs were more contendible, acquire some leverage, then go back to Italy (and still do deals).\n\nAmerican unis, the lore went, did not do things like this. They encouraged their people to not stay longer than five years, then go look for someone else to play with. This would re-align all sorts of incentives. We should imitate them.\n\nAnd people did, or tried to, but of course they could not really dislodge the barons (rectors, deans, heads of department etc.). So what they did was the easy thing: precarize the lower tier of the academic job market. Then reformers appear to have lost interest and moved on. \n\nNot sure what we can learn from these stories. Maybe my point is that the older generation abused its privilege, and earned a pushback that of course affected others. And maybe another point is that, when reforming, you should really really pause and think about rebound and other second-order effects.", "created_at": "2020-06-17 09:57:27.238415", "updated_at": "2020-06-20 07:29:14.741640", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 442, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 33.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [78983], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 65954, "user_id": 4861, "topic_id": 11911, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Well of course, finances and maintenance are a big issue.

This will allow the seminar's core group to build a shared reading list, a platform to stand on as we try to tease out fictional economic systems. It's also in line with the Research Network's scaling, as we are exploring interesting ways to think together at the limit.\n\nNow is the time to **choose our first title and a date for the first reading group**! I've updated [the wiki](https://edgeryders.eu/t/econ-sf-a-selection-of-works-and-authors/8582/55) to include the various additional books suggested throughout the comment thread.

In the days following the summit, the group retreats outside of the city to spend time and strategize together.\n\nI am joining NELIS at a time when those who\u2019ve been in it for the past two years wish to grow into an efficient structure. This bubbling energy is something I\u2019ve seen before: struggling with meta-questions (\u201chow do we organize ourselves\u201d, \u201cwhat is the container?\u201d) and downright ambiguities (\u201cwho do we ask about branding?\u201d \u201cdo we need permission?\u201d \u201cWhich online channels do we use?\u201d). Co-designing an organization is a brave step, and it\u2019s not easy to reconcile it with the need for action. \u201cWe need to be deliberate about membership formalization, but not over-design\u201d, Caitlin was saying. @Shravan and I found ourselves agreeing that consensus decision making doesn\u2019t work because it is time consuming and doesn\u2019t scale well i.e. when more people are involved. \n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/d/def772ac69e900ff9d4e1d1ea2533ab1a039df4e.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"517\">\n\nNELIS is special because it considers local action the centerpiece of the global network. The model is: distributed local chapters and projects, connected by a critical mass of leaders. There is a need for risk management and distinctions between members and non-members, a lot farther from how I am used to building a community. And I remember distinctly Meelan\u2019s remark that the hard distinction between global and local can be handicapping. In a session I led ad-hoc during the private retreat following the summit in Tokyo, I argued that **finding a structure for the organization has to do with growing a culture of working together.** I made the case for openness and inclusiveness, as well the design focus on small, incremental wins and less on failure points at this early stage (documentation is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zoscneJxn26Z9HmFu2kzYogUIsaoRkEz/view?usp=sharing)). The feedback was very positive!\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/75ea7b25c7c219d31d65687d1a69f33b0369dc89.jpg\" width=\"460\" height=\"690\">\n\nI\u2019m sharing here some near future steps I\u2019m encouraging in an Edgeryders - NELIS partnership or a more informal collaboration:\n\n* **Integrate local-to-global into a web platform:** a NELIS web home, one that allows for autonomous local work but where people can communicate easily about local progress in a way that is generative: their communication, if public, becomes great storytelling for the network without additional work.\n\n* **Make the platform open:** several in the group have voiced the need to easily onboard new members i.e. volunteering for festivals (the Americas Festival). An open, interactive workspace allows training them in a very social way and point them to orderly historic documentation. My offer is a whitelabeled version of the edgeryders.eu platform ([example](https://biofabforum.org/)). NELIS could have such a platform, with the added benefit of network mapping tools.\n\n* **Don\u2019t invest in communication, invest in community management:** in addition to collecting information from members and sharing it across, community management is about actively nudging people to share and collaborate with each other, find overlaps in their work and connect more, both online and offline.", "created_at": "2018-06-18 10:13:13.482996", "updated_at": "2018-07-11 07:07:11.189663", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 646, "wiki": false, "reads": 27, "score": 295.4, "like_count": 7, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1935, 5, 4539, 4566, 2915, 3293, 2272], "is_private": false}, {"id": 63940, "user_id": 2551, "topic_id": 11055, "post_number": 10, "raw": "Registered!\n\nTime to get some tickets. \n@ilaria it looks like I'll take the bus from Marseille on Monday already, we'll likely have partially a similar route if you also go along the coast. \nLet me know if you'd like me to bring some extra kit (projector, mics, recorders, stuff for remote attendance). \nI wonder if there is some chance of a \"port themed accommodation\", perhaps they have \"old sailor's houses\" or something else that is relevant for the event itself perhaps?\n\nThe way it looks this is from where the buses will arrive to the event venue: https://goo.gl/maps/bBpAC8s6GiZC4fRQ6", "created_at": "2019-11-12 22:14:46.647065", "updated_at": "2019-11-12 22:14:46.647065", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 106, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 56.6, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4022, 3, 5201], "is_private": false}, {"id": 59873, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 10621, "post_number": 6, "raw": "Hi and thanks for your note, it is interesting to read.\n\nAs my understanding of the Polish language is non-existent, I am responding based on what I have understood from Google translate - so if my responses seem strange it could be because I misunderstood something.

Also ask people to bring their laptop if they have one.\n\n## During the event \n* **Make sure your documentation team are on location, have at least one laptop each and have fully understood the instructions for how to do the documenting.** do make sure that someone who is on your team is taking very thorough notes from the discussions. This means: sitting with a laptop and typing, word by  word, what different people are saying. It is important to differentiate when different people are saying different things giving each person a codename (their initials) (almost like the format for scripts that actors get to learn their characters' lines)  . \n\n **BEFORE each participant has left the room:**\n\n* Make sure that the documentation team have posted all their notes on the platform\n\n* Collect/double check each individual's email address/ and make sure that they have  received an email with instructions for how to access the notes! and \n\n*  Do a demonstration of the process of opening your email, going to the website, logging in and then going to the right place on the platform and then publishing your own notes.\n\n## After the event\nWrite a follow up email inviting people to share their stories and that the best stories will be rewarded a storytelling prize.\n\nHope you find this information useful!", "created_at": "2019-09-25 10:40:23.462450", "updated_at": "2019-09-28 15:02:03.592197", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 593, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 27.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [59774], "is_liked_by": [1856, 5123], "is_private": false}, {"id": 66446, "user_id": 6035, "topic_id": 12036, "post_number": 1, "raw": "**Ask the person who is speaking right now what their name is, and if they already have an edgeryders.eu account?

And we have come to the conclusion, we will be holding more follow-up events delving further into the economic renewal of different sectors of the economy. Not going back to \"normal\" but making use of this window to explore new paths into a [better, more resilient, future](http://resilience.edgeryders.eu/). \n\nOur coworking event held on July 21st was a great success with between 40 and 50 people from all over the world joining in to hear coworking space owners, technology providers and network organisers gathered to discuss some of the challenges ahead.\n\nJoin in the [conversation here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/distributed-teams-as-distributed-economic-development/14183), started by one of our speakers John O\u2019Duinn. He gives a good summary on what\u2019s changed over the past few years in the world of work that has and will continue to enable employees to work remotely - something which, he argues, will have a positive impact on coworking spaces.\n\nIf you feel like digging a little deeper feel free to browse [our recovery forum](https://edgeryders.eu/c/ioh/coworking-recovery/364) and you will find [nuggets like this ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/can-coworking-burst-small-world-complacency/14032)from Faye Alund, the chief executive and co-founder of Kampul, a co-learning platform, and president of coworking Indonesia association. His story is an interesting one as he has worked for an organization that builds ecosystems through coworking spaces.\n\nWe have also been thinking alot about the link between the global pandemic and surveillance. One of our latest posts discusses how the government of Romania has decided to translate its entire database of clinical data treated by the health authorities to its ministry of internal affairs. Let us hear your thoughts on this[ here.](https://edgeryders.eu/t/a-surveillance-pandemic-results-of-the-community-listening-post-on-risks-for-freedom-in-the-wake-of-covid-19/13183/48)\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nOne of our founders has been looking at SSNA data and if there is a way for ethnographers to identify posts before before they are read. If you have any thoughts on how coding could be made more efficient to show results with the highest predicted semantic density [take a look at this thread](https://edgeryders.eu/t/predicting-semantic-density-in-an-ethnographic-corpus-first-steps/14193) and be sure to join in the conversation.", "created_at": "2020-08-07 13:21:31.735411", "updated_at": "2020-08-07 14:57:27.742848", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 541, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 72.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6140, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 6107, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<em>This is a guide based on stories of personal, lived experiences collected through in-depth interviews with people in different parts of the world.

You truly are an amazing person and I really glad Edgeryders can benefit from your experience and journey. Thanks in particular for sharing some intimate details about your childhood, which I know must have taken some courage in a semi-public setting like this one.\n\nNow, there is one question I would like to ask - which transpires from your story although you do not make explicit reference to it: what is yout take on traditional education? You say you 'learned by doing' and I know you didn't complete university. I think this is an important part of the story to explore, because so many young people today are told there is only one path to transition - structured education - while you might be suggesting something else: that learning can happen in very different environments and different people will embrace it differently.\n\nMy second question has to do with your multilayered approach to work.

Thank you for putting in the time and care to make these videos. There was quite a lot to unpack there for me, so I'll go through it step by step.\n\n### Sharing data between systems is the way to go\nOk, you, @eb4890, @krav and others have convinced me, the \"one graph database\" idea is not a good one. It's not necessary and will just make cause more trouble than it's worth. Thanks for talking me out of it.\n\nI'm also throughly convinced that we're going to share data between the different systems. Now what?\n\n### A short summary of Leobards proposal\nSince it's a lot to unpack in the videos, I'm going to make a very concise summary so that people can follow the conversation without watching all of the material (you should though, it's a great primer into linked data). So, @leobard, correct me if I've got something wrong or missed something important. Even better, just change it yourself, since this post is a wiki.\n\n#### Points on RDF\n\n1. Different systems solve different challenges, and to develop quickly and efficiently they should be built with whatever stack of technologies that fits the job and is familiar to the developers.\n\n2. Rather than different systems sharing a database, they should make data available to each other through shared standards.\n\n3. RDF is a tried, tested and open standard which Leobard recommends us to implement. In practice, this would mean that each application had an exporter which converted data from whatever database it uses to serialized RDF and makes it available at an endpoint.\n\n4. One benefit of using RDF is that there are a lot of standard schemas available to use on Schema.org which makes it easier for other developers to plug their systems into ours.\n\n5. Each resource (dream, person, event, membership, etc) is uniquely identified with URI, which in this case is a URL, for example http://dreams.theborderland.se/dreams/437 is the URI of that dream. We could then choose fitting resource type for a Dream from Schema.org, for example [CreativeWork](https://schema.org/CreativeWork). We would use the schema properties when possible and our own custom properties when necessary.\n\n6. By sending serialized RDF data between applications, we could for example create a new thread on Talk for each Dream created on Dreams and list all posts in that thread on Dreams, as long as both those systems implement RDF exporters and listen to the each others endpoints.\n\n7. If Particip.io and it's projects would join the RDF and Linked Data community we would find kindred spirits with a very similar ethic and ambition to ours, and make some very interesting friends and allies.\n\n#### Points on authentication\n\n1. Leobard recommends OpenID for single sign-on.\n\n2. Tim Berners-Lees Solid implements both OpenID and RDF but is still in early stages.\n\n#### Points on architecture\n\n1. A graph database is usually not a great choice for your primary data storage, but is fantastic for indexing and getting an overview of how systems fit together.\n\n2. A visualisation app built on a graph database could easily pull all the standardised exported RDF data from the different applications and keep an updated graph of how things fit together.\n\n### My take on it and how it fits with our current momentum\n\nIn general, I love this way of thinking, and I'm convinced by the arguments. Like I mentioned above, this has made me back away from the single database idea and made me realize it's better to opt for sharing data between applications.\n\nHowever, we also need to move with our current momentum. We currently have two applications within the Particip.io umbrella that we've invested time and money in.\n\n#### Dreams\n\nDreams is now almost three years old, and has seen substantial development. It's built on Ruby on Rails, and while it does not have any APIs currently, implementing an RDF exporter and have it listen to other endpoints would not be a lot of work if we'd decide on a good strategy.\n\n#### Realities\n\nRealities is a new system that will be at the core of how we make sense of the Borderland in 2019. We're close to finalizing the first development cycle as @erikfrisk will [deliver the first MVP](https://edgeryders.eu/t/assignment-getting-realities-to-mvp/8998/14) in the coming weeks. [It's already deployed on a staging server for testing.](https://edgeryders.eu/t/assignment-getting-realities-to-mvp/8998/14)\n\nRealities is a javascript single page app built on Node, GraphQL, Apollo and React with Neo4j as a database. In this case, we're indeed using a graph database as the primary data, but only because Realities is not really much else than an application to edit and view the graph that describes how the needs, responsibilities and roles in an organisation are structured and depend on each other. \n\nReact was chosen because it's the front end framework with the biggest momentum today, and it's also what most of the developers were familiar with. GraphQL was chosen because it's become an increasingly popular replacement for REST APIs with React developers. GraphQL works well with graphs and it has seen some use with Neo4j as it's database. \n\nNeo4j was chosen mainly because it was the graph database with which I was most familiar at the time, and it's a system that's easy to prototype models in.\n\nAll of the technologies chosen are open source. Apollo, React and GraphQL fall under the MIT license and Neo4j falls under the GPL3 license.\n\n### GraphQL vs RDF?\n\nIn your video you described how Facebook and other walled gardens greatly decreased interest in RDF. Ironically, once Facebook grew as huge as it is, it needed to find good ways to share data within it's walled garden and built GraphQL, which it has now released it's patent for. Interestingly, some of the RDF terminology is used by GraphQL, which recieves JSON schema templates to request data and then returns data in the same format as the request itself. [You can see these in action in the Realities code.](https://github.com/theborderland/realities/blob/master/api/src/index.js) I'm not sure if you're familiar with GraphQL, but essentially Queries are only requesting data while Mutations are making changes.\n\nWatching your videos made me realise that it would probably be pretty easy to implement a GraphQL endpoint in Dreams too. There is a highly maintained [GraphQL library for Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby) which we could use to relatively easily interface Dreams and Realities! That's a pretty interesting idea since @questioneer who is joining us for the development week in Medenine in November is a Rails developer with GraphQL experience.\n\nAs for having a graph database collect all relevant data, the Realities graph database could simply double as an index for all data from Talk, Dreams and other systems, and we could build views to show and filter that data as we keep developing Realities to also show Dreams connected to Needs and Responsibilities. As long as all new applications we build also implement GraphQL, this would be reasonably straight forward.\n\n### But what about RDF, Solid and the linked data community?\n\nDamn it. Right. I really agree with you that it would be cool to plug into that world. How does RDF and GraphQL overlap? Is it two technologies solving a similar problem? Does one complement the other? Is there any sense in using RDF together with GraphQL? I don't understand enough what an architecture using RDF looks like in practice compared to our Realities stack. Maybe based on the information and thinking above, you have some ideas @leobard?\n\nThis is a really interesting conversation, and I'm enjoying it. I'm going to tag @matthias because I have a little bit of a suspicion that we would also find this enjoyable.

So I moved it here.\n\nPersonally I'm not against self-medication in a situation like this where time-tested medical solutions are lacking. But as with any hacks, people must know and understand what they get themselves into. In my view, anyone who did not invest tens of hours of reading and understanding about an unproven treatment and its risks should not attempt it.\n\n[quote=\"noemi, post:138, topic:12164\"]I\u2019m preparing to go on 2 trips (Berlin and Indonesia) amidst all the coronavirus panic and early cases sprung out in these areas too.[/quote]\n\nHere are some random thoughts from my side. Don't take it as medical advice, but apart from that, do with it whatever you want :blush: \n\nIf this becomes a proper pandemic, then it can be expected that 60-70% of the population will become infected, at which point the pandemic will run out of fuel as each case will result in less than one infected new case (since everyone else is immune already). For those who think that the pandemic will come, it's a matter of deciding if they want to really be part of the 30-40% uninfected (which is extra hard work for the next 6-24 months) or if they want to accept the risk of going through the infection and then being immune.\n\nFor young people (like us :) ) in my opinion there is a fairly limited risk to worry about when going through the infection. Of course I'd follow the recommendations re. hand hygiene etc. to avoid it if possible. But case fatality rate is <0.5% for the age group <50 y/o, while 8% for the age group >70 y/o, and even higher for those with pre-existing conditions. These numbers do not account for asymptomatic cases, which seem to be half of all infected (judging from one of the cruise ships, where everyone got tested, unlike the usual practice where only people with symptoms get tested). So <0.25% for our age group maybe? It's not *nothing* of course \u2013 up to your judgment if you're ok with this in a foreign country.\n\nPersonally I'm super careful around old people I like, though. For that, I think John took the right approach, i.e. self-quarantine when returning from travels in epidemic areas.\n\nOh and: like I hoped, chloroquine seems to work against this stuff (see this [advance publication note](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/bst/advpub/0/advpub_2020.01047/_article) from a clinical study in China).

So both Jan and I had this problem with changing languages in codes. Not a big issue, but still. Does it have to be the case that once we assign a language to a given code we cannot change it (even if we change the code itself?)\n![image|690x387](upload://y6fpElkmHrOIveJ0ckVe5Rgjugu.png) \n2. Second thing. When we looked for the code car this is what we saw. Has it always been the case that the system returns all codewords with these three letters in this particular order? \n![image|690x387](upload://ceUjHj6tXV5wFsn1bMaqlXYTA6r.png) \n3. I think I already wrote about it somewhere, but I may put it here as well. So Jan and I have a code \"Catholic Church\", not only did it automagically merge with already existing codes (we didn't do it, maybe someone did it, maybe the system's arcane algorithms) but it also divided them between alberto and johncoate. In Jan's panel in the backend and in our codebook which links to it (as presented in the second printscreen) we have my and his codes grouped together (as should be the case after merging), but when we use the search codes option in the codes tab it shows several churches and our codes are assigned to/merged with alberto's and johncoate's (as shown in the first printscreen).\nTo me it happens at random, several of my codes, despite having an already exisiting name, remain separate. Some merge without even asking me for permission...\nIt's also strange because Jan changed the name of the code to capital letters after the merger (catholic church -> Catholic Church) and my codes still show here as spelled lowercase.\n![image|690x387](upload://1N3k8jZgC9pXYMwgzORJdCBh5Ah.png) \n![image|690x387](upload://wuhv5hATw7YMp7G98fpcThe9deT.png) \n3.

We also noticed that when you change your language in user preferences, the system will stop showing you results of search codes in languages different than the one set there. Unless the language is English, that is. \nI had my language set to Polish and coded for a name of a radical-right organisation called \"all-polish youth\" (I tend to code in English first for some reason). The system had no problems finding it. But when I added the Polish translation (\"m\u0142odzie\u017c wszechpolska\") it returned no results for \"all-polish\" youth and was able to find the code only when I put \"mlodziez\". It all works in reverse when I set my language to English - I can search for English names of codes, but the system returns nothing for Polish translations. Do you guys have the same issue? Can we ever make it so that a given code can be searched for its English and native language name?", "created_at": "2020-07-16 18:18:59.082750", "updated_at": "2020-07-16 18:56:06.218750", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 501, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 12.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [80547], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 49612, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 9159, "post_number": 38, "raw": "Sure, and can I ask you to remove people's email addresses from this public thread? :-) see you in a bit!", "created_at": "2018-12-21 13:27:16.702365", "updated_at": "2018-12-21 13:27:16.702365", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 21, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [49610], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 67542, "user_id": 5191, "topic_id": 12189, "post_number": 3, "raw": "So the 2 most basic principles of Steward Ownership are: \n1. A company can never be sold\n2. Rewards to investors and employees happens in the form of a predefined, capped profit share.

Like we did. \n\nThe real challenge to be Steward Owned is that there is not (yet) a lot of liquidity on the investor market because it's a relatively uncommon model in the software world, and that you practically need to generate revenue as soon as possible. To get investments you need to convincingly show how you can make revenue, as opposed to just show that you can grow and then exit - which is difficult in the early days. \nHowever being able to generate revenue and profits is definitely an advantage because you naturally and sustainably grow, and are hard to kick off your feet once these gears are rolling.\n2 companies that recently switched was Buffer and Sharetribe.

It only works if all other parts are working (landing pages are easy to understand, there's a promo plan for promoting events, projects..). It isn't magical when a person sees our ad, they don't instantly convert (would be nice), it needs to be seen several times.  Its a never-ending work in progress to reach the right audience for each post promoted.** \n\n**It's my responsibility to inform everyone on low numbers to everyone, not other people to me. Mea culpa on that.** \n\nI'll start by posting a Q&A based on people's woes that I hope will ease their worry on paid advertising. \n\n\nQ: **We're getting some traffic from Facebook ads, but people aren't converting. Why?**\nA: Facebook advertising isn't magical, and people don't convert from seeing the ad once or twice. In the NGO world, NGO's spend on average over 300 dollars to get a new donor (couldn't find an average rate for subscribers), but this varies of course (source: https://mrbenchmarks.com/words/digital-ads). This will be put to a proper test with landing pages. \n\n\nQ: **We're getting traffic, but the numbers aren't all that big**\nA: Only paid advertising on Facebook untill now were boosted posts (boosted post on Facebook means that a post that was posted on a Facebook page was promoted to a larger audience so more people see our content. Boosted posts usually generate comments, likes on posts, but people don't usually click on those posts to visit the URLS promoted.)\n\n\nQ: **Why were the posts boosted and not promoted as a regular ad?**\nA: At the beginning, it was discussed in my strategy that we should promote the landing pages of wellbeing and IoH. But, very soon it showed that people who visit those pages on the platform don't fully grasp what Edgeryders is, why should they care about it and why should they contribute. This proved to be a waste of precious advertising euros. This is should be resolved by finishing up landing pages for wellbeing (http://wellbeing-europe.surge.sh/) and IOH as there it will be more clear what Edgeryders is, why should people care, they will be able to see stories and then they can contribute to the discussion on the platform\n\n\n**Q: What will be done once the landing pages for Wellbeing are functional?**\nA: As the information on those pages will show to our target audience more clearly what Edgeryders is, what wellbeing is and showcase stories, to achieve maximum results, they will be set up as stand-alone, ongoing advertising campaigns to our target audience\n\n\n**Q: How will you make sure we get people we want and not random people that would click, leave a troll comment perhaps and leave?**\nA: Landing page for each native language will be pushed out to target audience we want to reach (what will be used in targeting, which interests, pages, portals etc. will be showed to the outreach team, but I can share here as well if you're interested how Facebook advertising works). Campaigns will be re-targeted and monitored DAILY. Every two days, targeting will be adjusted to ensure we're hitting the right audience. \nAt the end of each week, report on the numbers will be made (with Facebook and Google Analytics numbers. Bear in mind, Facebook and Google Analytics have a discrepancy in showing visits. Here's why: https://boostlikes.com/blog/2016/08/facebook-clicks-google-analytics\n\n\n**Q: What can you do if a discussion starts on Facebook on the ad? we want that discussion to happen on the platform.**\nA: Here I propose a rule of 3. When a person comments on Facebook, he/she will receive an answer on their 3 questions. Fourth comment coming from Edgeryders will be an invite to join the platform and comment there. Fifth comment (if they don't respond to the invite) can be a personal message to their inbox inviting them to join. Note: likely not everyone will be OK with joining.\n\n\n**Q: what to do with those that don't want to join Edgeryders?**\nA: If they are active in a polite way (I propose anyone who starts calling people names, insults to be deleted without notice), they can become brand ambassadors and they can boost engagement on Facebook. The ad that has engagement is much more interesting than the one that has no engagement. \n\n\n\nTo finish this section, I'm attaching a report of Facebook engagement and Twitter engagement from the start of my role. You can see an increase in engagement and fans (note this is WITHOUT an ongoing campaign that will promote wellbeing and IOH). Note: lower number of posts were due to fluctuations of posting, now we're back to daily posts. Visits here are only those measured by Hootsuite, paid ads aren't measured. \n\n[Snippet 1](https://imgur.com/a/JhYRnYq) - Facebook\n[Snippet 2](https://imgur.com/PmUQ0XB) - Twitter\n\nAlso, [Here you can see see the average cost-per-click and average click-through rate for NGO's.](https://brandcdn.exacttarget.com/sites/exacttarget/files/Facebook-Ad-Benchmarks-SFMC.pdf) \n\nYou can see by seeing below that we're well above average. [This is a snippet from our advertising](https://imgur.com/8NhzNq8).\n\n\n\n\n**How to ensure that every cent used is spent as an euro in advertising?**\n\nBy following a re-worked digital strategy (which will be discussed in detail with the outreach team), this is just a summary.\n\nEdgeryders (from my understanding), has 3 main services through which people can join Edgeryders: \n\n* Projects\n* Events\n* Stories of members\n\nThese three services are all gateways of converting people, but, they are also branding sources for people to get to know what Edgeryders is and what it does and why should they care and join in. \n\nTo get people to convert, they need to see what Edgeryders is, why is Edgeryders there, adjust Edgeryders so it provides value to the target audience (if possible, if its not a project summary or general Edgeryders news)\n\nHow to leverage stories on Edgeryders digital channels: \n\n**Stories**\n\nStories need to be leveraged as: \n\n* Facebook post updates \n* Twitter posts \n* Linkedin posts\n* Instagram posts \n\nFormat of posts in which they can be shared:\n\n* Text/URL with the image below\n* Text/URL with GIF below\n* Text/URL with quote image below\n* Text/URL with the video below\n\n**Events**\n\nEvents need to be leveraged as: \n\n* Events on Facebook\n* Facebook posts that educate and inform the audience about the upcoming event/s\n* Twitter posts that and/or and promote the event\n* Linkedin posts that educate and/or promote the event\n* Instagram posts that educate and/or promote the event\n\nFormat of posts in which they can be shared:\n\n* Text/URL with the image below\n* Text/URL with GIF below\n* Text/URL with quote image below\n* Text/URL with the video below\n\n\n**Projects**\n\nOn social channels: they need to be clearly explained what they are, why they exist and how can people contribute (if they can and if it's expected of them).\n\n\n**Paid advertising**\n\nPaid advertising has a role to boost all above-mentioned services so they are seen by the right people, seen by a wider audience so they can see what Edgeryders is.\n\nNot all stories should be boosted, only those that are considered important and those that are related to the upcoming event(s).\n\nHow to ensure that we get the right audience for events, projects, stories?\n\n\n_**Event paid advertising**_\n\nOutreach managers to contact Inge and me and tell us who is the target audience and key messages (Inge and I can help here)\n\nThen I will research Facebook on how to get to that audience, together with Inge see how can we craft the message to get people on Twitter, adjust it for Linkedin and Instagram. \n\nAfter this, a post plan will be made for ongoing promotion of the event and upcoming events to make sure that posts are relevant and that the audience gets educated on what the event is. Tasks for this will be made as a checklist for each event. \n\n\n_**Project paid advertising**_\n\nFor the promotion of the project, a persona will be used as a base for online promotion (from sharing organic content to paid advertising). I or Inge will reach out the project managers to get the idea about the project, and key messages that should be promoted. after getting this, a detailed promo plan will be made so right people see info about the project. \n\n_**Stories paid advertising**_\n\nEvery week, a promo plan is made with general stories (with the outreach team), and expanded by posts related to upcoming events and projects. \n\nReporting\n\nAt the end of each week, a side-by-side report from social channels and Google analytics will be provided to everyone so it can be discussed. At the end of each month, a summary post showing that month's trend will be shared with everyone to see the overall performance. \n\n\n\n@inge @nadia @noemi @alberto @natalia_skoczylas @johncoate and everyone else who wants to contribute to this :-)", "created_at": "2019-07-26 12:55:17.627835", "updated_at": "2019-07-26 13:06:43.586590", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1587, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 67.6, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856, 4265, 137], "is_private": false}, {"id": 81729, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 14228, "post_number": 7, "raw": "I will be working all of August, but mostly off in September. :slight_smile:", "created_at": "2020-08-13 13:15:19.953138", "updated_at": "2020-08-13 13:15:19.953138", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 13, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 14.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [81720], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 73188, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 13013, "post_number": 14, "raw": "but you don't have to drink the stuff..", "created_at": "2020-04-01 02:24:03.570560", "updated_at": "2020-04-01 02:24:03.570560", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 9, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 8.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [73162], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1816, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 1783, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Today we published the initial release of the <a href=\"https://github.com/makerfoxnet/network_barter\">network_barter</a> RubyGem library, as free software (reminds me, I have to add a licence note ... oops).

University education nowadays is largely skills-based, so you get the particular training you need to, again theoretically, enter into the trade or industry that you have chosen to pursue. This is not only a waste of the potential good that higher education can provide, but I strongly suspect that it will come to be seen as insufficient in the not-too-distant.\n\nI am currently stranded in the US, where people come out of university with literally hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt and just a piece of paper and some initials to show for it that sanction that they are 'qualified' adepts at something. Yet I have met university graduates who show a stunning lack of competence in their 'qualified' field, and I have also those who have not graduated yet can think and act circles around so-called 'experts' in a given discipline.\n\nEspecially with the advent of the Internet, the ability of people to self-educate has increased in a way never before thought-of. The problem we're starting to encounter is that these self-educated people are becoming capable and willing to start <strong>doing things</strong>, but are frequently hitting a brick wall in the form of the monopoly on accreditation by increasingly-expensive universities and related institutions.\n\nIn an age where access to information is easier, and people are increasingly strapped for cash, can we really continue to require expensive qualifications, which were developed pre-Internet at a time when knowledge was hoardable, at the risk of denying hard-up yet competent people the ability to contribute?\n\nGiven my support for Classical approaches to education, I am not advocating the demise of the university. I think the university can retain its traditional role as a place where people can go to help them cultivate well-rounded perspectives. At the same time, I think we need to come up with new ways of recognizing competence that factors in the new and unconventional ways that people are acquiring skills and aptitudes.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-09-18 13:58:25", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:21.676421", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 446, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 37545, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 7248, "post_number": 2, "raw": "[quote=\"gehan, post:1, topic:7248\"]\nyou sell me your poverty, your ill-health, your unemployed status so I can sell my labour to agencies and organisations who sell \u2018positive outcomes\u2019 to well-intentioned programmes, sadly usually funded by the EU and governments\n[/quote]\n\nThis has accents of deep truth.

Present: @Jirka_Kocian @natalia_skoczylas @hugi @noemi @johncoate @marina @alberto @inge @anon82932460 and @nadia \n\n\n## ACTIONABLES:\n       \n**Everyone does:** \n\n1. Add your rough reflections, further questions etc following our call in one comment below\n2. Write down everything you know of in terms of your schedules activities, upcoming events etc in a separate comment\n3. Come to a weekly content call: community managers for different projects and languages quckly go through their picks of last week's content and Inge & Filip can ask questions. \n\n**Filip/Inge do:**\n\n* Set up Content plan\n* Set up flow of content on edgeryders that can tackle different aspects of the platform\n* Figure out the workflow\n\n**Nadia does:** \nSchedule the weekly call after consulting the team for a time that works for all. \n \n\n## MEET THE TEAM\n**Inge:** Anything that needs to go out into the world, ping inge and she can read &amp; optimise it - content. Needs help with: Messaging. \"_. When I started editing, i felt maybe I should explain why I am editing this way. Noticed some stuff is missing: What is the added value what we are asking people to do? And what are we doing with these stories? More generally there is a Platform wide chammenge: most people do not read full stories, people read one paragraph and then they leave. With every story we need one sentence description at the top. So if you have one on one conversations with people about your project, what do you say/ how do you explain what it is about? Send me that. Also ping me where you need help and explain what you think needs to be done with it. I might miss things, or you might have a cool idea that I havent thought of\"_\n\n* Noemi: \"_I see. But Inge, one thing: note that POPREBEL is engaging more with lay people, some of whom have really strong experiences of deprivation. so for them I think we need to show the rewards of the stories and paid positions more proeminently_\"\n\n* Inge: \"_can you explain &quot;lay people&quot; and deprivation?_\"\n\n* Noemi: \"_maybe I'm wrong and how you design it is: if the message is attractive, it should speak to digitally savvy and not; added value can be reward: like ladies who suffered abortion; or who are feminist activists; or priests; really, across the spectrum_\"\n\n* Natalia: _regarding the people who poprebel addresses: i'd call them &quot;regular&quot;people, not necessarily very internet-savvy, but also not too many left-leaning (which we have a majority of active on the platform atm, mostly because I try to just snowball movement by bringing relevant, strong stories)_\n\n**Filip does:** Social media wizard who knows how to get it out in the world in the right way - distribution to right people with the right content. Needs help with: _\"I am now creating a funnel, to see which kinds of content fit into which part of the funnel - I need you to tell me what you think would work with people I  Which are profiles of people who already come in? Which are stories which triggered them in the past? Also what we think will trigger them in the future...Also, I need you to tell me which kinds of cool content you already have which could work (video works better than images)\"_ Need to figure out the added value for reader - what is your program/project about? how do you explain the project in-person?If you have one on one conversations with people about your project, what do you say/ how do you explain what it is about? Send me that! Also ping me where you need help and explain what you think needs to be done with it. I might miss things, or you might have a cool idea that I havent thought of\"_ \"\n\n**Noemi**: Is the team leader for the community management in Wellbeing in Europe. Role is to build capacity and processes for our team, make sure there are sections on the site in the different languages. Need help with: \"_We assumed that the first thing that people who show up should be to sign up for the virtual cafe. So far Natalia has been talking to people one on one, which is not sustainable. I need help with spreading the message to get people we dont know to come to the virtual cafe:  1) outreach for community calls/ Virtual Cafes 2) Pushing out weekly summaries collected by community managers onto social media_ \"\n\n**Hugi**: Only works on NGI - outreach to the grassroots community; finding unusual suspects; go to the hacker communities and activists and engage them to come to the platform. One way so far has been an event in Stockholm, a pre-launch of the project/platform that brought in a seed community. I also go out to other events - ccc camp, Radical Networks and talk about the project needs help with: disseminate stories to a larger group, getting them to journalistic level editing for mass spread; out on social media.  For following event - help with messaging prior.\n\n**Natalia** needs help with: reaching groups of people we do not normally meet with, people with right wing views, needs help to engage them and. Feels platform is not so user friendly, it takes personal leading around before stories can happen. \"_Nadia has created umbrella story for how we tackle them - but it is not clear how to communicate them appropriately._ \"\n\n**Jirka**  -  I Mirror Natalia  - I work on POPREBEL, is community manager for the czech part of the wellbeing in Europe project- also involved in the post analysis of the content we will have. _I am trying to transfer this concept we have in mind and the into possibly relevant ideas for the czech engagement\u2026.we started to exchange ideas for last couple of weeks._\n\n**John:** Been in internet business for 30 years. As main NGI community manager focus is on the conversations themselves, trying to bring out the best and most ongoing communication amongst the people who show up on platform. Believes in events as good way to bring in people. Believer in the story basis - what people say about what they are doing, what they are coming from and what they are about. So far I think the discussions are high level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Background to call:<br>\nWith the addition of @inge and @anon82932460 the Edgeryders Outreach & Dissemination team is now set, it is time for a first call to introduce everyone who will be working together on community management and outreach activities.

Team Drives</h2>\n\nWe are now using Google Drive Enterprise. This allows us better overview of access levels and a stronger degree of isolation between projects when that is desired. Unlike files in My Drive, files in a Team Drive belong to the team instead of an individual. Even if members leave, the files stay exactly where they are so your team can continue to share information and get work done. Work in Edgeryders is heavily project oriented, so this approach fits our way of working.  \n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2. Access control</h2>\n\nA team drive can have one or many managers that set the technical policy restrictions of the drive. For example, a Team Drive manager can restrict users from sharing documents in the drive with users who are not added to the drive, or restrict it so that documents can be shared, but only with other users with edgeryders.eu Drive accounts. A manager can also allow or prevent commenters and viewers from downloading, copying, and printing files in the Team Drive.\n\nRead more about the difference between [different access levels](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7337554) and [sharing restrictions](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7662202) in the official Google Team Drive documentation.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--3\">3. Access your Team Drives</h2>\n\n1. Get an account on the Edgeryders Drive. Any director can make you an account, and @hugi can give support.\n\n2. If you already have another Google account, you can seamlessly switch between accounts by pressing your profile picture in the top right corner. Click \"Add account\" to add your Edgeryders Drive account to the menu.\n\n3. Go to drive.google.com and switch to the Edgeryders account.\n\n4. See the Team Drives you have been added to in the drop-down right under \"My Drive\".\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--4\">4. Security policies</h2>\n\nSecurity policies and settings are different for different Edgeryders Team Drives. Every Team Drive should have a document named \"\u00a7 Team Drive Policies\" in the root folder of the drive. Read that to understand the purpose of each drive and what the security settings of it are.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-1\">4.1. All Protected Documents Drive</h3>\n\nDocuments containing private or personal data (like contracts) for any project should be stored in the  [\u201cAll Protected Documents\u201d drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0AKk8C7TDXwEwUk9PVA), whose drive membership limited to directors and unit coordinators. Sharing of these documents with collaborators and project managers should be done on a per-document basis (e.g. share each contract only with the collaborator whose contract it is). \n\nFor each project, make sure to also put a folder \u201cContracts\u201d into every project\u2019s Team Drive, containing only a small HTML file with an explanation and the hyperlink to the actual location of contracts on the \u201cAll Protected Documents\u201d Team Drive.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--5\">5. Advanced topics</h2>\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--5-1\">5.1. Making files accessible to the public</h3>\n\nIn their infinite wisdom, Google decided that files in Google Drive Enterprise and GSuite cannot be shared to everyone. For one, sharing settings are only available for files, not for files and directories as in normal Google Drive. And then, link sharing for files is available but here only means \"share with everyone in the organization\", not \"with everyone\" as in normal Google Drive.\n\nOptions to solve this:\n\n1. **Share with individual accounts.** You _can_ share individual files with up to 200 specific Google accounts inside and outside the organization. Everyone without access will see a screen where they can request access, and then you get an e-mail about it and can grant access. Since this is a hassle for both sides, this solution is only applicable if you know all or most of the people who will ever need access and can grant that upfront, or if only very few people will need access at all (and thus have to go through the \"request access\" process).\n\n2. **Publish the document content in a view-only, web-optimized version.** Instructions for that are [here](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/183965?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en). Note that this will only publish the basically as a HTML export \u2013 it does not allow the viewer to do anything besides viewing it. So downloading it as PDF or in OpenOffice format, or adding it to ones own Google Drive \"My Drive\", or making a copy and adding that to \"My Drive\" are not possible. If you want to allow any of these, choose the second option below.\n\n3. **Create a public folder in \"My Drive\".** The folder will not be inside a team drive, but at least accessible under \"My Drive\" with Google Drive Enterprise accounts. Instructions:\n\n    1. **Create a folder** using a \"normal\" Google Drive account. It will not work when using one of the Google Drive Enterprise \"organization\" accounts.\n    2. **Set the folder to \"Everyone can: view\".** Or \"view and comment\", or \"edit\", as you like.\n    3. **Share the folder with Google Drive Enterprise accounts.** Include sending a note that explains they should add the folder to their \"My Drive\" to have it accessible comfortably. They will not be able to add it to any team drive.\n\nWe have used the third option from above to create a folder \"[Edgeryders Public](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1xe98rwP5lU7eSx2u3b-rEkXSTrt6Duci)\", containing some templates and other publications that we want to link to in file form from our platform. Anyone, but esp. Edgeryders O\u00dc directors using their `\u2026@edgeryders.eu` Google Drive Enterprise accounts, can add it to their \"My Drive\" section.", "created_at": "2019-02-04 23:47:30.487748", "updated_at": "2020-10-20 12:52:40.532470", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 996, "wiki": true, "reads": 20, "score": 389.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 15544, "user_id": 1842, "topic_id": 2812, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>a way of thinking and approaching challenges that allows the com</b>\n\nOran took the time to write a response, but couldn't log in. \u00a0So here it is (and my thoughts in return)\n\nOran:\n\n\"<em><span>Co-creation is a way of thinking and approaching challenges that allows the combined intelligence of all stakeholders\u00a0</span><span>involved to guide a process.

We believe that the power of playing can give us profound perspectives on how to move forwards out of this global mess.\n\nWhat happens when the success of each party involved in the game depends on the success of every other party? How these games can inform us for designing post-entrepreneurial models, mutual care systems, and untapping on different forms of investing and producing generative value. How can we heal the fabric of our society?\n\nWhether it is a canvas, a card game, a software, a business model, a video-game, a party game, an art installation or a social experiment or whether you're joining alone or with your team you're welcome to spend two days crafting games and approaches that are simple, replicable, suitable for different context.\n\n## YOU CAN COME ALONE OR WITH YOUR TEAM ##\n\n# AGENDA #\n\nSATURDAY\n\ufffd8.30 \u2013 we open door\ufffds\n\n9.00 \u2013 *we close doors*\nwe gather for a small breakfast at 8.30 am and we start sharp at 9am\n\n9.00\u201414 Deep Work\nwe'll spend the morning of Saturday trying to step back from the problem-solving mind and seeing the full picture\n\n14\u201415 Lunch break\n\n15.30 Check-in getting back from lunch\nIn the afternoon we'll dig into deep sharing and mixing of models, projects and approaches\n\n16\u201417.45 First Round of Working Tables\n\n17.45 tea break / stretch\n\n18\u201419.30 Second Round of Working Tables\n\n19.30 Break and Eating together\n\n20 Cacao Cerimony and Celebration\nWe'll celebrate in the night with an in-house party with cacao and nice vibes :)\n\n~ SUNDAY ~\n\u2013 we start at 11am harvesting the learnings from the previous day and continuing refining our experiments and helping each others to document and produce them.

Create an [edgeryders.eu](http://edgeryders.eu/) account\n2. Tell us about your [proposed project here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/about-the-propose-a-hackathon-project-category/10956).\n3. Look at the list below and pick one or more tasks that you can help with, and leave a comment here if there is a way for you to contribute. Very much appreciated!\n\n### How is this event being organised?\n\nThis event, and the festival it is part of, is coordinated on the edgeryders platform (where you are now) and co-curated through a series of community video calls. We have allocated a collaboratively managed budget for the festival and operate on a solidarity basis. Participants who need some financial support to organise or be able to participate in the festival are eligible provided they contribute towards making it a meaningful and generative experience for all - in the run up to, during and/or after the event. If you would like to join us but are unsure as to how to contribute, don\u2019t worry. Create an [edgeryders account](https://communities.edgeryders.eu/login), then [tell us a bit about yourself here](https://edgeryders.eu/c/ioh/tell-us-about-you) and we will guide you along from there.\n\n### How is this all financed?\n\nThis event is part of the NGI Forward project Generation Internet (NGI) initiative, launched by the European Commission in the autumn of 2016. It has received funding from the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 825652 from 2019-2021. You can learn more about the initiative and our involvement in it at [https://ngi.edgeryders.eu](https://ngi.edgeryders.eu/)\n\n![Ngi logo|150x61](https://ngi.edgeryders.eu/assets/images/ngi-logo.png)\n\n![Eu emblem|150x100](https://ngi.edgeryders.eu/assets/images/eu-emblem.png)\n\n### Does getting involved mean I endorse the funders views or actions?\n\nNo. What you are doing is contributing to an open consultation on the topic of how to build a next generation of internet infrastructure, technologies, business models etc that promotes the wellbeing of humans and the natural environment. The consultation methodology is designed in such a way as to allow for diversity of views, premises, disciplines, themes and contexts. We employ open notebook science principles and the results will be presented in the form of a research report accessible to everyone after the event. You can follow the process, review the methodology and open source tech we are using and engage directly with the research and coordination team here: https://edgeryders.eu/c/ioh/workspace\n\n### What is the code of conduct?\n\nIt is important to us that everyone in the room feels welcomed and safe; if you have any particular concerns or needs just send me a PM here on the platform or write to [nadia@edgeryders.eu](mailto:nadia@edgeryders.eu) .\n\nThe Edgeryders online platform technology and activities are intended for people to cooperate within and across projects trying to build a better world.

I posted two issues, which are simply bugs: [one](https://github.com/edgeryders/magic-spreadsheets/issues/1) and [two](https://github.com/edgeryders/magic-spreadsheets/issues/2). Here, I would like to discuss the logic of the prototype. I have a request, a suggestion and a question.\n\n###Request: separate clearly the budgeting functions from the bookkeeping ones\n\nRight now, the Magic Budget does two things (or it will, when it's finished). One is actual budgeting. Before the project happens, the project manager tries to predict _future_ cash flows: how much money will go out/come in, and (critically) when. **This is by far the most important function of the MB**: that's why it's called Magic Budget, and not Magic something else. The other is helping monitoring: as money gets spent and earned, the project manager can put her _past_ cash flow into the sheet, and check how well she is doing with respect to her predictions. \n\nI don't think I want to use the monitoring functions at all. The main reason is that FreeAgent does this already. If people want to use them, great. But I would like these two functions to be clearly separated (different sheets) so that I (and people who want to do like me) can just focus on the budgeting part, and never look at the rest. \n\nNotice that past cash flow data are not used to predict future cash flow. This is important, and it would be a mistake to do otherwise. All those transactions are summarized in the bank account balance. The Magic Spreadheet (aggregating all the magic budgets) starts from the actual bank account balance, adds future revenues and subtracts future costs. So, my refusal to do cost-tracking in the MB does not break the the MS.\n\n### Suggestion: adopt FreeAgent's item reference logic\n\nI would like for different rows in the \"Budget\" sheet to accept _the same_ item reference (column B). Furthermore, I suggest that the item references are the same as FreeAgent uses. This reduces the cognitive load of bookkeeping, because our different tools use similar logics. Look at [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/145avvcb6wno3tKGsUO1kYzp4kE5PjhA-iCuVcq5zKY8/edit#gid=2147433014): why cannot I have \"staff\" in B5, B6, B7 e B10? \n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a3af58418b56b72b84be10148cad546c900cb546.png\" width=\"412\" height=\"496\">\n\n### Question: how do we tell the Magic Spreadsheet to accept the data from any given Magic Budget?  \n\nYes :slight_smile:", "created_at": "2018-08-28 16:40:22.966784", "updated_at": "2018-08-28 16:40:22.966784", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 430, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 57.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 48659, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 9143, "post_number": 6, "raw": "[quote=\"anique.yael, post:5, topic:9143\"]For example, most of the time I work many more hours than I'm paid for \u2026 in this case I could use the third option of a weekly timesheet correct?[/quote]\n\nTechnically yes. Or you could use the timetracker and edit its records afterwards if it's \"too much\". Even better is to track / enter all your worktime, but only report as much as you can get paid in the project. Will help us to determine how profitable our projects are overall. (I edited this in to the wiki above.)\n\n[quote=\"anique.yael, post:5, topic:9143\"]So I'm just not quite clear on the the manual calculation of the subtotals per work package[/quote]\n\nNo longer needed. We (as Edgeryders O\u00dc) don't need that information in invoices we receive, so I removed that part from the wiki.\n\n[quote=\"anique.yael, post:5, topic:9143\"]On expense types [\u2026] I propose the following changes:[/quote]\n\nI used the expense type categories found in the Financial Reporting Template provided by NESTA. And I assume that UCL (once they provide their version of the template) will have the same or very similar ones, because they also appear in the [European Commission Reporting Template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OQu7wLbOqZRJjC9U13IaPN-GLvIs09HV/view) on p. 24. So these are \"official\" categories and we can't use others, right?\n\n[quote=\"anique.yael, post:5, topic:9143\"]non-eligible is changed to Indirect costs[/quote]\n\nGood point about indirect costs, I'm adding that category to the wiki (it will be used rarely of course since most indirect costs will appear in the core project, not related to a single project). Non-eligible _direct_ costs are possible, though, so I prefer to keep that category in. For example in OpenCare we had the case of funding the development of the consent funnel (non-eligible since it was reported too late or something) and for Noemi's work to clean up the consent data (non-eligible as it was not budgeted for, so we paid it from our profits \u2026 but it was still a direct cost).\n\n[quote=\"anique.yael, post:5, topic:9143\"]What I'm not seeing here is how people's hours are then translated into their PMs?[/quote]\n\nThat will be a task of our custom software. Since there seem to be multiple ways and we can decide (within limits) which one to choose, I'll ask you in time which one is the right one. Applying a standard of 1720 productive hours per year for everyone would already enough to derive the calculations.\n\nThe hourly rates, on the other hand, are not relevant for the reporting templates \u2013 these all use person months, and monetary values assigned to these. Hourly rates will be needed for people invoicing Edgeryders O\u00dc for a certain amount of hours, so it would avoid confusion to calculate these values and put them right into people's contracts. Not relevant for the software under discussion here, though.\n\n[quote=\"anique.yael, post:5, topic:9143\"]Periodic reporting depends on the project but I believe ranges 6 month (min)[/quote]\n\nI expected something like \"monthly\". If it's every 6 months, then custom software development for this as in my proposal is borderline uneconomical compared with manual data extraction. Since we have two projects at the same time and manual data extraction is just plain horrible (wanting to spare you \u2026 ;)) I think we'll still go ahead and create this piece of software \u2026\n\nSo far, so good. I think I know what I need to know to get this piece of equipment done (with @anu \u2026).

It was very grassroots \u2013 David Osimo, at the time a European Commission officer himself, persuaded his higher-ups to give us a room for free, and everyone paid for their own travel. Tom Steinberg was there, and Dom Campbell, and Lee Bryant, and Marko Rakar, the people that were breaking new ground at their respective national levels.\n\nIt was all very new. And yet, we were already speaking about the idea of holding personal data in \"digital wallets\" that people would then allow different applications to access, on a need-to-know basis. DECODE is going down the same way, if my understanding is correct. The idea just made a ton of sense, as it does now, and so it kept resurfacing at regular intervals. So, we need to be asking ourselves: why did it not happen in these ten years? Why is the Internet, if anything, _less_ decentralized now than then? How credible is the next attempt to go in the same direction?\n\nThere seems to be an understanding among non-naive thinkers (like [Alexander Galloway](https://castig.org/alexander-galloways-protocol-an-argument-summary/), [Vitalik Buterin](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274) and [Nathan Schneider](https://hackernoon.com/decentralizing-everything-never-seems-to-work-2bb0461bd168)) that we can not attack this problem with a sweeping, elegant theory, as all such theories are likely to be contradicted by facts. \"Be specific\", Schneider warns, and I believe he is onto something.

Our 18 guests from 13 European Cities were very interested and reacted with their own examples and some questions.\n\nThe representative of City of Porto for example, mentioned their project called \u201cBridge to the Future\u201d. They brought together elderly people, students, companies to discuss, understand and think solutions for elderly people problems. The best outcome would eventually be tested in a Shark-Tank like arena of investors, to pitch their core ideas. People asked if OpenCare has provided a budget also for prototyping. The EdgeRyders platforms rose interest in participants. Guests from France and Holland questioned if the platform was inclusive enough, given than it takes a degree of internet literacy to use it. Polish guests asked if, using English as a common language wasn\u2019t limiting. @Rossana_Torri and @Costantino provided answers and stimulated the discussions. The morning ended with a recap session where participants have been asked to provide a SWOT analysis of OpenCare.

The borders all over Europe and beyond are closing, and it is possible that nobody will be traveling anymore in the next months. Other Brussels friends whose families and businesses are in their home countries, are also coping and find themselves at the mercy of phone and Internet connections.\n\nIn my case, I was used to seeing family every two months, and most of my close friends remain there (@georgiana_b, @ponyo and @alex_stef among others <3).  We keep in touch by reassuring warm messages and sharing advice. Thanks to @Matthias, I can advise my mom on how to make their own disinfectant with this [WHO approved recipe.](https://edgeryders.eu/t/status-report-whats-up-with-you/12164/164) When no disinfectant or alcohol is available in our nearby shops, people like @alberto buy ethanol in bulk online and offer to share some! This makes one feel lucky, above all. \n\nI happen to have a solid partner in Brussels, but I can only imagine that these times are hardly good for hooking up with new people? Is love life in the times of corona suffering too? \n\nThe strangest thing is to follow two communities of which you belong to, all at once: numbers coming in from both Belgium and Romania affect me just as much, but it is only in one place that I can actually do something, as small as it is. \n\n# What are you doing to keep yourself busy and feel useful? \n\n**I follow and share Belgian news regarding support for freelancers**\nThe government offers to lower the taxes for social contributions for the first two quarters of 2020. If you need this - read more about it here: [in French](https://www.lesoir.be/284750/article/2020-03-05/coronavirus-les-independants-peuvent-demander-une-dispense-de-cotisations) or [in Dutch](https://www.vlaio.be/nl/subsidies-financiering/subsidiedatabank/overbruggingsrecht-voor-zelfstandigen-coronavirus?fbclid=IwAR0wN8I0_jUNNNMyc_WRI1Ts9Hbb0E2A5_j7II8Pgx_yWFsIEQY9vKETHn0)\n\n**I try to buy as local as possible, from the smaller shops rather than supermarkets.**\nSeeing people queue up outside of local health stores was a strong reminder of the communist times when every day you'd have to stand in line for your milk, bread and just about any food. But it's worth doing it if you want to support your local shops. This from thebulletin.be:\n\n> Belgium\u2019s measures against the spreading of the virus include the shutdown of cafes, bars and restaurants. Takeaways and friteries can stay open. Mong Tangton, the owner of L\u2019Epicerie, a small sandwich bar in Ixelles, is relieved he can stay open. \u201cNo one can sit here and have a meal any more - I closed the restaurant area,\u201d he says. Tangton underlines the importance of state intervention to help the sector. \u201cI work alone, but some don\u2019t. They won\u2019t be able to pay rent and their employees. The state has to help us here.\u201d\n\n**I practice yoga and support the teachers.** The yoga room in Brussels where I usually go immediately took measures and they are now providing [classes online](https://www.yoga-room.be/online/). Most of their teachers are freelancers, so they are among the hardest hit by this crisis - we all donate for the classes to support their income. This is important because it enables us to practice solidarity and support local businesses.\nYou do good by doing what you love.\n\n![yoga%20at%20home|690x517](upload://a63K1wYmtY1HaIEWX9pjrX0NtZ5.jpeg)", "created_at": "2020-03-17 09:51:00.138040", "updated_at": "2020-05-18 09:07:46.801258", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 647, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 294.4, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4096, 5, 2580], "is_private": false}, {"id": 44329, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 8534, "post_number": 11, "raw": "@yannick @ireinga would you be interested in taking part?", "created_at": "2018-04-27 16:16:38.336461", "updated_at": "2018-04-27 16:16:38.336461", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 9, "wiki": false, "reads": 42, "score": 68.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [44326], "is_liked_by": [3904], "is_private": false}, {"id": 49014, "user_id": 347, "topic_id": 9229, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Yes, Noemi, of course this makes a lot of sense!!\nYou are the expert here so, please jump in!", "created_at": "2018-11-27 14:17:54.951797", "updated_at": "2018-11-27 14:17:54.951797", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 19, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 7.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [49013], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16436, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4540, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Thanks \u2013 and how to use the issue tracker</b>\n\nThanks <a href=\"/u/hegazy\">@Hegazy</a>.

As a result, individuals who gain a certain level of education represent a specific cultural characteristics that allow them to address specific professional and social position. Still the formal level of education says about cultural capital held by the individual. University Graduates have different competences than the graduates of basic vocational  school. \n\nRejection of the importance of education as an indicator of validity of the person on the labour market takes place among people with a similar level of education \u2013 therefore possessing a similar cultural resources. The Edgeryders probably live in such social circles, where higher education is obvious and ceases to be a determinant of the difference. However, looking at society as a whole, education creates very different trajectories and constructs different social worlds.\n\nThe policy of educational expansion (as it takes place in the EU) can cause the impression that education ceases to be a channel of social mobility. But it is not the case \u2013 one cannot take any social position without passing through the system of selection and allocation. The problem is that, there is no longer a clear transition from education to work period. It is also the price for the increased the degree of freedom \u2013 we are no longer condemned to work in only one particular profession throughout our life.\"", "created_at": "2012-09-28 09:01:39", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:18.013325", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 274, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 15.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [13735], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 49148, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 9267, "post_number": 5, "raw": "I agree, though to be honest I like how, despite how wordy we are, we are rather minimal at codifying ourselves.", "created_at": "2018-12-03 18:17:22.772703", "updated_at": "2018-12-03 18:17:22.772703", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 21, "wiki": false, "reads": 26, "score": 55.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 42629, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 8197, "post_number": 12, "raw": "I was not aware of this RINA thing.

No one wants a repeat of the disaster of 2008, but the complexity of actual economic systems and the wide variety of proposals means we don't have anything new that has caught a preponderance of opinions.\n\nThe Left is hoping to foment the class war they have always wanted, and this worries me (aside from the potential for violence), because I have seen little evidence that most governments have not allocated resources more efficiently or justly than the private sector.\n\nIt seems to me that the education of children is the MOST important means to change the future -- NOT the short term political process, so I think developing and implementing a curriculum of social solidarity which is not based on nationalism is critical, and even one which is built around the consideration of humans as part of the ecology and applying that to all aspects of what schools do -- how does our language treat nature, how does our science treat nature, how do our societies treat nature, etc. And this will enable us to develop an economic system, based on what we can realistically do as human psychological actors. A lot of proposals are built around humans that are better than we are -- socialist systems so far have utterly failed because they were forced down the throats of people who want to see direct benefit from their labor, rather than altruistic benefits to people they don't know. We need to deal with human feelings by expanding the compass of who is \"us\" -- not artificially by force but organically by education.\n\nSo the psychology and sociology necessarily precede the change in economics, in my view.", "created_at": "2019-11-11 20:06:14.186775", "updated_at": "2019-11-11 20:06:14.186775", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 355, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 22.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 35045, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 6850, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Welcome then @SyMorin!

It's particularly true of an organization aiming at <em>stewardship</em>.\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>it is hard for the wider community to use a resource that isn't reliably available</li>\n\n<li>to preserve something over time, you must make sure there is always somebody available to maintain it</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nBut groups are made of people, and people aren't reliable. They forget, get bored, fall ill, leave.\u00a0\n\nSo the challenge is: how can unreliable people make a reliable organization?\n\nThis isn't a new problem. If you look at the big structures of society -- corporations, governments, markets, armies -- you'll find they are all shaped around the need to be reliable.\n\nThey do it in 2 basic ways:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Make people more reliable (e.g. through discipline or incentives)</li>\n\n<li>Make people interchangeable</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nTake an army, for example. Soldiers are trained into reliability (e.g. by following orders at all costs). Ranks and training are standardized, so that any individual can easily be replaced by another with the same skills and rank.\n\nOr look at a factory. Workers are disiplined into arriving on time and working for 8 hours. And they are given standard jobs -- if one worker doesn't get out of bed, someone else will take over and the assembly line will continue.\n\nNeither method works well for a group like Edgeryders. We (presumably?) don't want to treat each other as interchangeable parts. We (mostly?) want to choose our own lives, not subject ourselves to the discipline of the drill-sergeant. So we need to find new methods, making reliable groups without turning ourselves into robots?\n\nLet's discuss:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>how can we build reliable groups?</li>\n\n<li>which projects have managed it, and how?</li>\n\n<li>do we need reliability anyway?</li>\n\n<li>what methods could we adopt for edgeryders itself, or for our other projects?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nFormat: discussion group\n\nAttendees: min 3. no maximum -- we can break into smaller groups if more than ~8 take part\n\nEquipment: just space and somewhere to sit\n\nDate: 2014-10-24 09:30:00 - 2014-10-24 09:30:00, Europe/Brussels Time.", "created_at": "2014-09-22 18:37:59", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:20.129811", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 395, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 20.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 41691, "user_id": 2330, "topic_id": 7332, "post_number": 12, "raw": "Welcome!", "created_at": "2018-02-09 00:17:52.928187", "updated_at": "2018-02-09 00:17:52.928187", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 8.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 73928, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 13166, "post_number": 1, "raw": "*This is a wiki summary of one of our community calls.

With the Design University in Stockholm we have moved a workshop online and we are going to make a film project where students contribute their own snippets. We are going to search material representations of connections.\n\nOlivier: Doing an online course, and trying to to manage his time between calls and ebinars everywhere. He's unemployed, and wants to help people to improve their French. \n\nDanica: An architect focused on green cities and urban nature. 'This new situation has cut all of our funding. I'm thinking of not stopping, maybe deliver a podcast or similar, that can go online, so we can continue to share the knowledge.' Has an improvised studio in the apartment, so can start.\n\n> **This whole thing is going to force forward people's approaches in everyday life. We will recollect our actions and maybe change something tomorrow**\n\nDanica's association is part of a European Federation in 15 countries leading in green cities, and there is a lot of valuable information and experiences that we all share. \n> **I wanted to collect all and bring it to Serbia too. We are very very far from being a green city in Novi Sad, but the awareness of the people is starting to get higher. That's why I want to continue with my actions.**\n\nNoemi: proposed to think about urban greening together with the Edgeryders and Reef network - we would love to get new partners and see for example: what, if anything, from the [Green Urban Living](https://edgeryders.eu/t/the-future-of-ecological-urban-living/12097) repository created end of 2019 can be a topic for a podcast? \n\nEnzio: arrived 7 months ago in Japan at the Goethe Institute, before he worked in Sofia and Munich for a long time, also for Goethe. Many of his colleagues now have to learn how to teach the same things, but online (video, stage design,..), and struggling, especially those who are older. \n\nIn Kyoto the Goethe Institute run an artist residence:\n\n> **what to do here in a residence without residents? how to develop new ideas if you dont have the target group, the guests.. The challenge for his team of 6 is: what should we do instead? It's an inner crisis. Maybe we can find out some new methods to rethink the concept of a residency**\n\nIt's not clear how the Japanese groups will cope with this challenge - without an audience, without a job. It's the kind of work defining your personality. Japan takes a lot of time to think and develop new things.\n\n> **There are many challenges inside the institutions and personalities in culture. For example in Japan there is not much structure of independence, they invest 10% of what Germany invests in culture. It will be good this year to remove the masks at least online, to exchange about how others cope with this challenge**\n\n'I feel alienated', one of us said. This cultural shock is alienating. We are all 'forced to force ideas forward'.. It's an important step forward to try to search for other experiences with online means.\n\n[Noemi note: notice this gap - someone said something personal, but it's hard to continue because the personal is tied to the professional, so it becomes a conversation about 'our kind']\n\n# What would be innovation in culture? \n\n* **Build networks of artists and practitioners** who understand and know how to make use of support, and engage in constant ways of rethinking work (especially people between 20-40yrs). Example: Cultural Innovators Network, in particular in the Mediterranean area. For individuals - important to learn how to make use of networks and connections and don't expect the institutional environments to come up with resources, because the way they work is not compatible. Everyone minds their own business in a way.. \n* **Go beyond the high level art**, understand how to the social community work is connected to artistic production, how the needs of the city can connect with culture.\n* **Figure out how to embed the online: ex- how to put together an online residency.** There's a big gap between European/Japanese way of organising, but is there a chance to make this visible, experience-able online? Of course, it would never be the aim to make all cultural activities online. We will always long for direct, analogue contact.\n* **If it's digital it's free -** wrong. How to find ways for artists to put their work online to an extent? Or to even work online and use more affordable, open source tools?\n\n# Next steps: \n\n1) Which of these aspects would you like to see discussed at length in a curated session/ webinar?

One is a sort of rational economic perspective. In this case, organizations benefit from being shown in maps and directories because it brings publicity and makes them findable for the people they want to be found by. This incentive already exists, which is why many organizations do maintain their data, more or less, in centralized directories. What we're doing is allowing those organizations to *consolidate the effort of data maintenance for many directories into a single point.* That point is within the admin interface of the organization's own website. \n\nThe second way of looking at incentives is: how do you actually get people to do things? This is more about psychology and less about economics. Even when there's an incentive, annoying housekeeping tasks like the ones you mentioned often don't get done, not because they're not a rationally good idea, but because nobody gets around to doing them!\n\nCombining these two, our adoption strategy is something like:\n\n* Partner with existing networks to reach out to nodes at scale. Ideally nodes will receive invitations from multiple networks.\n\n* Make it *super easy* to adopt, with initial data automatically populated from the node's website.\n\n* Use gamified reminders and notifications to encourage nodes to update or check their data as needed, with the lowest possible barrier to action (key to this is the location of the update process within an admin interface where they already are, not requiring external URL or login credentials).\n\n* Add features that deliver quantifiable value (syndication of event listings, needs/offers, etc.) to increase the basic incentive to participate.\n\nThis strategy remains to be tested. Feedback and suggestions are welcome!\n\nRegarding your second question: you're right that all the data probably exists elsewhere already! But, after spending many months working with a few specific network organizations towards sharing data between very much overlapping directories, I am not convinced that any kind of centralized authoritative directory is the way forward in the long term. \n\nI am completely in support of the OpenCorporates project. I think it is relevant to but not a substitute for what we're working on because:\n\n* It doesn't include the kinds of human-relevant information we need (things like mission statement or organization description)\n\n* It's not organized by values or intent (we want to help movements for a more just and sustainable world see themselves, and OC doesn't include metadata that captures these intentions)\n\n* We need to include groups that are not defined by a legal entity\n\n\nMore abstractly, a beautiful thing about moving authoritative data into the hands of the nodes themselves is that can *allow the node to decide what about itself is important*. With centralized directories the directory decides what about the data subject is important, by defining the data fields. This means that, even if you have shared protocols, it remains difficult to make data usefully interoperable because what different directories think is important doesn't necessarily match. Even more generally, data out of context loses meaning. Corporate registries are a informational context that is institutionally defined, for purposes and context of the institution, not the organization the data is about. This relation of context and meaning might have something to do with why filling in government forms is an almost universally uninspiring task!\n\nWith self-defining data we can turn this around. Hopefully, the better fit the node is for a given directory, the more what's important will be a match between the two, and the node's presence within that directory will be appropriately rich.  \n\nThis approach is experimental, and will remain a balance between defining taxonomies that work for directories, and letting nodes define themselves through a wide array of possible fields. \n\nIf any of that is excessively obscure or doesn't make sense, I am happy to clarify!\n\nAgain, very interested in feedback from the Edgeryders community about all of this.

NOTES (16.06.2020)\n\n1.\tUsing the Codebooks: input codes in alphabetical order with a brief definition (see style guide), mark who is coding which threads\na.\tUse a dictionary where possible, use invivo description for invivo terms, use own definitions for original codes\nb.\tFor repeated codes, mark threads that contain the same code, e.g. \nInternet: (see thread on Non-Ubiquitous and Communal Internets).\nc.\tBe collaborative: highlight and comment on your own + other team members\u2019 codes \uf0e0 maintaining a dialogue about the coding process is key!\nd.\tMemos: capture your thoughts, comment on each other\u2019s threads, flag issues, things to monitor etc. \nExample: Memo #1 (Covid 19 Threads) CCS\nStarting to work on the Covid threads, noticing now that many of the initial ones are set up and primarily populated by people of the Edgeryder team. Not a lot of input from other participants on the platform yet. Also side-note, we probably need to make a decision about how we want to deal with the fact that people use the words \u201ccorona\u201d \u201ccovid\u201d \u201ccovid-19\u201d etc interchangeably (or so it seems). Any thoughts on this? I wouldn\u2019t want to add unnecessary splintering to the SSN graph when were really talking about one single thing (if that remains to be the case).  \nComment (Leonie)\nIt actually might be interesting to monitor this for a bit and see when each term is used and why. I am guessing 'corona' might occur more in less formal contexts for example. We could also monitor which term is being used the most/appears most frequently and then go with that.\n\n2.\tThree Codebooks: Main codebook, Environment, Covid-19\nWe mainly use the big codebook until we identify core thematic areas that we want to devote more time to. We move coding to thematically dedicated codebooks (e.g. environment, covid), but cross-reference these for overlapping codes/definitions\n\n3.\tTrouble-shooting: collaborative coding in a project without a clearly defined goal/ no clear theoretical framework can be frustrating: coding is often very descriptive as community members aren\u2019t yet bringing in a lot of personal narratives and opinions, not a lot of qualifying language. It is totally fine to continue with descriptive codes, but it would help to have more 2nd and 3rd rounds of coding the same thread and scheduling meetings around emerging themes + develop more theoretical frameworks for analysis, developing more specific social semantic codes (memos also help). \uf0e0 e.g. AI and ML \u2013 bring in fairness and accountability literature (that is less US-centric). \n\n4.\tGoing forward: more check-in meetings, discussing codes, identifying themes\n\n5.\tTime spent coding: It depends on the thread: some threads are dry and descriptive and can be done quickly/only require one round, others take longer and require several rounds of coding. In general, max 2 hours per session. \n\n6.\tMultiple codes per highlighted item are possible and encouraged (sometimes a little tricky to get the clicker to work).  \n7.\tEditing codes: its ok to make \u201cmistakes\u201d, to use codes as place-holders or change your mind about codes later \uf0e0 all can be edited!\n\n8.\tFocus on codes that have a lot of comments (particularly those with a range of community members \u2013 not just the community managers)\n\n9.\tMake your own posts: it is encouraged that we add our own content, bring in new ideas, flag questions for discussion, participate in discussions etc. but only when/if we feel comfortable", "created_at": "2020-06-17 10:30:37.247491", "updated_at": "2020-10-17 11:50:02.234783", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 659, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 32.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5059, 5479], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6678, "user_id": 1514, "topic_id": 4643, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>git+markdown</b>\n\nA combination of git and markdown is an interesting option.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>markdown is easy to learn</li>\n\n<li>git is the best revision control system</li>\n\n<li>git repositories are just \"directories\".

Also exploring [character strengths](https://www.viacharacter.org/survey/account/register) and research related to them.\n\n* I explore this platform, of course. Did not manage to find my spot in it yet, but I do like it a lot. \n\nWhen it comes to actively doing things, I found a lot of joy in encouraging other Stiintescu coordinators join an online meeting. We tried Hangouts and did not work as smoothly as our Zoom with you. But it was really nice to get in touch and find out about each other like this. We promoted it as a support group and talked mostly about work :sweat_smile:, but it was a good start I think.\nAlso, I found the courage to ask our local project coordinators (Stiintescu in Brasov) if they would enjoy an online meeting and 2 of them are on board. I plan to connect them with others in the country and...we shall see.\n\nThank you again for everything and... keep in touch. :star_struck:", "created_at": "2020-03-27 13:11:48.697615", "updated_at": "2020-03-27 13:11:48.697615", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 301, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 41.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 6360], "is_private": false}, {"id": 56620, "user_id": 4022, "topic_id": 10343, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Two stories from the last week mixed together in my mind for a \"what if\" idea.\n\n## Sand is finite, and we might run out\n\nThe first story is the one told by the excellent podcast 99% Invisible in their episode on sand. It sounds like a headline in The Onion, but it's not completely overblown \u2013 we're running out of good, easily available sand. And sand makes concrete.\n\nhttps://99percentinvisible.org/episode/built-on-sand/\n\nA few key takeaways:\n* We\u2019re adding the equivalent of eight New York Cities worth of buildings to the world every single year. Most of them are made out of concrete. \n* Easily available sand to make concrete is becoming scarce. The same thing that has happened with oil (fracking, offshore drilling) is now happening with sand - we're digging deeper and deeper to get it and doing more and more damage and using more and more energy.\n* Our most efficient way to reduce the \"embodied carbon\" footprint of buildings is to use them for longer before we allow them to fall apart or tear them down.\n* Also, some very cool things like mass timber (possibly enabling wooden (!) skyscrapers with a negative carbon footprint) are on the horizon to offer alternatives to concrete. \n\n ## There is a 55,000 square meter abandoned casino in Italy\n\nhttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/01/27/closure-europes-oldest-casino-leaves-italys-historic-como-exclave/\nOnce a ludicrously wealthy tax-haven, this town of 2000 people was completely supported by a single enormous casino. An enormous palace of gambling was built in 2007. Today, it's closed and gathering dust. And Campione has already turned into a ghost town, as the school and stores have closed. Now, there is a 55,000 square meter palace in the middle of nowhere on the border between Switzerland and Italy. I can't imagine any massive companies standing in line to move their headquarters to very flashy building far away from everything. \n\nIt becomes evident that one of the most positive environmental actions one could undertake right now would be to find out what to do with this building and this town.\n\nIs this an interesting topic for Climate KIC and the Edgeryders climate unit?\n @alberto, @ilaria, @noemi (and throwing in @matteo_uguzzoni because what a location for a game!)", "created_at": "2019-07-13 19:13:41.578652", "updated_at": "2019-07-13 21:18:22.907536", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 388, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 216.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4795], "is_private": false}, {"id": 51323, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 9559, "post_number": 10, "raw": "[quote=\"richdecibels, post:1, topic:9559\"]can anyone offer advice about setting up a fresh legal entity in Europe [\u2026] We are looking at setting up an Estonian company[/quote]\n\nWe have some instructions based on our experience here: \"[Setting up an Estonian Osa\u00fching (O\u00dc) company using E-ID](/t/id/5930)\"", "created_at": "2019-03-04 10:30:44.627435", "updated_at": "2019-03-04 10:30:44.627435", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 51, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 7.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [51304], "is_reply_to": [51304], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 68628, "user_id": 6085, "topic_id": 12393, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Dear project leaders,\n\nThank you for taking the time to prepare and submit the offline tasks.

The topic and the angle it is approached are definitely interesting for me personally and professionally, and hopefully I could bring a useful additional point of view to the discussion.\n\nBriefly, my story: after my studies in political sciences and international relations with a focus on human rights, I started working in the field of international development cooperation and humanitarian aid. I have worked for different kinds of organisations (NGOs, Italian Development Agency, European Commission, private companies), and for the last 5 years I have been project manager and trainer/consultant for a consulting company, especially working in the area of training and skills development for the development and humanitarian community, with the European Commission being our main client.\n\nDevelopment cooperation, with all its flaws and contradictory features, is (or should be) fundamentally driven by the goal of fighting inequalities and eradicating poverty. However, after 70 years of international development cooperation, while some progresses have been achieved, it is evident that inequalities are still growing.\n\nThe age of the Internet has brought many new opportunities and challenges for the global fight for justice and equality. Technological advances have made knowledge, services and goods far more easily available to a bigger share of global population. However, the control over these resources is increasingly concentrated in the hands of few stakeholders (usually private corporations, and to a lesser extent public entities).\n\nDuring my university studies, I followed a course about the governance of the global communication and information systems, which raised my awareness about the intimate link between how technology is designed and how much the users are (or aren\u2019t) protagonists of the decision-making processes that impact their daily lives.\n\nFor example, I am currently involved in the design and development of an online training programme, funded by the European Commission, to develop the skills and awareness of volunteers engaging in solidarity actions in Europe. We are just starting, but it is already evident that accessibility for everyone is key for the success and usefulness of the programme, as it is the direct involvement of learners in shaping the e-learning contents and modalities.\n\nAnother example is the possibility to use geo-spatial data to provide humanitarian or development services with the direct involvement of beneficiaries.\n\nIn general, my curiosity is piqued by the possibility to develop technologies that can re-shape development policies and practices towards a needs-based approach instead of a donor-driven approach.\n\nBesides strictly development/humanitarian aspects, I am interested in the role of technology, AI, social networks and IT tools that can empower citizens and foster democracy in an increasingly complex global society.\n\nI look forward to meeting you in Brussels.", "created_at": "2019-11-01 12:41:59.683074", "updated_at": "2019-11-01 12:41:59.683074", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 496, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 84.6, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4934, 2915, 4861], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16804, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 2256, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>FormStorm as the tool, the means to the end</b>\n\n[k],I think it's great if you manage to turn this into an entry!

And \"what is this Egderyders thing, I don't understand\".\n[/quote]\n\nYes, an online forum is a barrier. But in-person ethnography at this scale is an even higher one. So, we go for the lower one. Most people will not get it, and will not participate. That's OK. It's always been that way. \n\n@johncoate can tell you how people got on the WELL: get a floppy disk mailed to you, then install software and configure their modem, then endure dial-up speed and a text-only interface. And pay for the service. Of course, most people thought they WELL users were weirdos and would have not been caught dead doing any of this. That's OK, because the WELL did not need everyone. They only needed a few thousand people to get on board, and they got them. That's OK for everyone, both participants and non-participants. Free country.\n\nA good rule of thumb is not to go out of your way to accommodate people that will not go out of their own. Those early WELL adopters saw a clear value proposition, and accepted to jump through the hoops of 1980s computer-mediated communication in its name. With online dialogue, 95% of people are just not up for it. They are on Facebook. They are on Whatsapp. They wax lyrical about face-to-face contact. They point to UX glitches, but, in my experience, they are just not interested enough. Nothing you can do will get engaged. This is completely understandable, because written, online dialogue is hard work and not for everybody, including many smart, energetic, articulate people.  You still do work on your UX, but you do it to accommodate users, not non-users. The 5% who do see the value.\n\nIt's been the same for me throughout the years. Visioni Urbane, then Kublai, then Edgeryders 1, then Spot The Future, then OpenCare. We used Ning. We used Drupal. We used Wordpress. We used Discourse. We used Second Life, God have mercy on our souls. Identical results: a small minority gets very active and engaged. Everyone else shrugs and goes tight back to hang out with the cool kids.

The tradeoff we are facing is: \n\n* **If we break the four debates across four completely separate platforms** (different codebase, different database, no single sign-up), this is more appealing to the \"ontologist in our head\". Medieval history has a shelf in the library, business has another. This is a fallacy, because [ontology is overrated](http://shirky.com/writings/ontology_overrated.html), but whatever: it is how most people think at a superficial level. So the advantage is that it is initially more intuitive and easier to explain.\n* **If we keep them close and \"meshed\"** ( like different cats in the same Discourse instance: one signup, notifications from every topic that you contribute to, across all cats) we make moving from one debate to another easy, like wandering from one group of people to another at a party. We tried this in opencare, with significant spillover (explained above in [this post](https://edgeryders.eu/t/h2020-citizen-science-discussion/8297/12?u=alberto)).

And this part pretty much hits it: :laughing: \n\n> If it sounds utopian, it\u2019s only because of how far we have come from the idea of a city being designed to serve its *demos*, rather than its lordly masters. \u2026 As a professional cyberpunk dystopian writer, I\u2019m here to tell you that our ideas were intended as warnings, not suggestions.\n\nThere's only one part where I don't fully agree with Cory, and it's a minor technical item:\n\n> All of this is simply broadcast to all the devices in the vicinity, and your device can \u201ctune in\u201d to a stream of data simply by plucking it out of the electromagnetic spectrum, without activating a connection to the server that would leave a record of what you took an interest in.\n\nBroadcasting to the vicinity is a bit limiting, as one couldn't find out about a delayed bus from home for example. It's also not required. Just let everyone download *all* the city's data. Then the server also cannot know what somebody is interested in, as everyone gets the same stuff delivered to their device, and then the device apps extract what is of interest.\n\nThis data would be pretty compact and can be well compressed. There is still an overhead by providing everything to everyone, but it seems ok. We can compensate by transitioning away data intensive applications where the data transferred serves no justifiable purpose at all.\n\nFor example, [my favourite open source maps app](https://osmand.net/) works like that: everyone gets the whole download (say, the whole map of Germany) and all the updates to that (which are small). That way, the server never knows who is looking at what area, unlike with Google Maps.\n\n[quote=\"johncoate, post:4, topic:12534\"]\nAlso you mention \u201cJoin the alliance of autarkic cities.\u201d Is there such an alliance?\n[/quote]\n\nNo :| It's just a utopian idea so far.

In Belgium it's about collecting and learning from one another's failures and so on.\u00a0\n\nIt all starts with seeing and understanding one another's work, then making sense of how to move forward better.

All payments are processed centrally, and finally made from the Edgeryders account at LHV Bank. The actual person manning the bank account is always a company director: this is necessary given that directors are legally responsible for stewarding the company's assets. However, project autonomy means that the director making the payment does not necessarily know the context in which the payment is requested. \n\nIn Edgeryders, it is the project manager's (PM) job to approve a bill or other expense for payment. Once approved by the PM, the paying director (PD) will simply execute the payment, and only ask questions if something smells wrong. The process works like this:\n\n* Someone completes some tasks and issues a bill to ER. \n* The PM approves it: this means that the collaborator or subcontractor has delivered what she should have delivered. The payment is authorized. \n* The PM, or the collaborator herself, uploads the bill onto FreeAgent. It is important to assign the bill to the correct project.\n* The PM, or the collaborator herself with the PM's explicit authorization, creates a Dynalist task in the [Payment Queue](https://dynalist.io/d/7aI9WsBWMMgCS2aablD9uIjT#z=U3rGJI9xOAwAHdRfYxdx2GDT).

Something like: look, we know you love your swimmingpool. However, we have decided to close it down, and replace it with a better facility. The rationale for this move is [some reason]: more information can be found at [some link]. Give us a chance before you rise in anger, we actually know what we are doing. By the way, here is [a Facebook page] where you can ask any question that might bother you, we'll be reading and replying in all honesty. Thanks, your Mayor.\n\nIn Milano the new administration has extended the previous one's congestion charge experiment. Given that the issue is controversial, they opened a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/areac.info/\">Facebook group</a> in which the municipality engages with citizens. The result was surprising: while still heated, the debate has shifted. Now cyclists and pedestrians are vouching for themselves, and are at least as loud as the pro-car shopkeepers that traditionally monopolize this debate. The experience has led the city to organize <a href=\"http://barcamp.org/w/page/51089824/TrafficCamp\">TrafficCamp</a>, a Barcamp dedicated to urban mobility and a meeting place between the City and bloggers and social media activists, perceived as key opinion leaders that could influence the debate on traffic management.\n\nSo, MarukumuC, I guess I disagree: bridging this trust gap with information and open conversation is exactly what open government does best. :-)\n\n", "created_at": "2012-03-01 14:19:04", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:26.736449", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 269, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 78686, "user_id": 6425, "topic_id": 13811, "post_number": 25, "raw": ":) this link to registration form: https://edgeryders.eu/t/registration-form-for-events-template/13588\ncorrect?", "created_at": "2020-06-10 14:20:59.488386", "updated_at": "2020-06-10 14:20:59.488386", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 16, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 11.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 44392, "user_id": 3904, "topic_id": 7958, "post_number": 19, "raw": "<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a9ec789d52a93877f4e7ceb8dec2ec5f58bc9480.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"517\">\n_(this image is simply a sketch of some things that have made themselves visible and is offered merely as a starting trace of intersecting parts for the research network\u2019s healthy scaling and strategies)_\n\n## State of Play\n\nThe Edgeryders Research Network is in the process of scaling its activities and assets :mushroom:. This has most recently focussed on proposing a **work package model** - of community outreach, stakeholder dialogue and social semantic network analysis - into **eight Horizon2020 proposals across five work programmes** in the latest round (as above). We anticipate receiving results by early July, with project start dates ranging from October 2018 to early 2019. Should we win even two of these proposals, it will be necessary to **address significant operational scaling** - such as training through the Academy, community partnerships, project management and technical development. Whether it happens in this round or a subsequent one, preparing for this is a priority.\n\nAt the same time, the **activities of the research network respond to the interests and drive of its members**. At present, numerous interests and prospects have been raised - from applying commons-based and self-organising philosophies in collective research spaces; _to_ project ideas such as a summer school and the recent Econ Scifi event; _and_ important alignment with other Edgeryders\u2019 initiatives like SenseStack. \n\nThere\u2019s plenty to consider and for now I\u2019m going to cover **a few aspects that are rising to the surface now**. These have come through direct conversation from interested people (in particular @alberto) , as well as through a research network brunch in March with @alberto @nadia @amelia @ireinga and @hugi  They are framed by me here however this is offered as **an (evolving) starting point** - this is an **open and collective process** and I invite you to jump to and tag yourself where you\u2019re most interested, and share ideas and feedback in the forms that suit you. \n\n* _Philosophies of scaling_\n* _Interests and needs in scaling_\n* _Processes and operations to scale_\n* _Human resources and shared assets_\n* _Summer projects and next steps_\n\n## Philosophies of scaling\n\nSome members, are interested in how we co-create a healthy and open research community beyond silos of specific projects. My own research for example, explores processes and practices in collective thinking-making-living for resilient and autonomous livelihoods. Earlier in the year, @asimong and I had a conversation to begin exploring how the Edgeryders research network might scale - the conversation suspended itself in the wave of H2020 proposals and I\u2019d like to open it up again here and now. It\u2019s crux is **how we conduct research as a commons**. This compliments existing Edgeryders approaches around **open knowledge and data, and of course mobilising across our collective intelligence through knowledge sharing and ethnography**. \n\nFor me, the question has been evolving with the momentum of the Reef ecosystem and SenseStack\u2019s vision. I\u2019m thinking deeply about the composition and intersection of our social, economic and knowledge flows. I\u2019m thinking about the value of these flows and their capacity to self-sustain (across individual to local community to ecosystem). I\u2019m thinking about data and skill-sharing, inclusion and access. I\u2019m thinking about wellbeing and belonging in a network. I\u2019m thinking about curiosity and the paradigm shift. I\u2019m thinking about alliance. And I\u2019m curious as to what you\u2019re thinking about in relation, and how our shared interests and needs can support our scaling. \n\nHere are some questions @asimong and I began asking:\n* How do we craft a form of research whose output is knowledge that\u2019s actually available in a useful way to commons-oriented citizens?\n* How do we tie this back to the needs of the emerging new society? \n* How do we do this in the context of EU research \u201cindustry\u201d and the \u201cacademic precariat? \n* How might our collective research experiment with and apply self-organising and autonomous philosophies?\n* How can digital and open technologies support the human living systems we really want and through different modes and mediums of expression?\n* Ultimately, how do we support a growing living research community? \u201d...one that sustains itself not only intellectually but socially, culturally, emotionally\u2026 where people care, where people matter.. where the research agenda is not set by international capital...\u201d\n\n## Interests and needs in scaling\n\nVarious interests have been voiced around the research network, others are emergent and more are invited. Those noted include:\n\n* How different projects can be built on and benefit from each other: **interdependence and collaboration**\n* **Practice-based and P2P research**: citizen-led research, applied research, knowledge and skill-sharing and research towards societal transformation\n* Development of **ethnographic coding ontologies**: evolving open ethnography and multilingual, multimedia ethnographic research across communities\n* **Scaling the network**: collaborative social entrepreneurship, research, mobilsing grassroots impact and collective wellbeing\n\n## Processes and operations to scale\n\nAcknowledging the **emergent and self-organising** approaches cherished and practiced across Edgeryders, a key focus area is **how to scale the research network\u2019s activities with simple, effective and welcoming processes**. I, in particular, am interestedin  being prepared for a **collaborative agility** in coordinating multiple and interconnected research projects, especially those with higher stakes such as any incoming H2020 projects. Some points of attention and interest raised:\n\n* **Project planning**: open-source, accessible and agile planning/ reporting tools \n* Access: **navitable and inclusive pathways for onboarding** Edgeryders into the research network\u2019s activities. Aka \u201cplug-in here\u201d where there are clear entry points and a social contract for involvement - ping @ireinga - and knowledge-sharing events - ping @yannick @noemi.\n* **Documentation**: Opportunities for creative collaborations around sharing learnings and developing scalable models through in-situ project participation - ping @natalia_skoczylas @gregoiremarty\n* Communications: **internal/external communications channels** and ease of information access - ping @matthias @owen and @zmorda\n\n## Human resources and shared assets\n\nIn order to scale we need to consider management of our capacities and assets. This is clearly a huge territory and the following are a few initial thoughts that have arisen from the network. \n\n* **Onboarding and sustainability**: what models and processes can ensure trustful and welcoming onboarding into the research network\u2019s team and how can they be valued and cared for. \n* Activities to sustain the network and available assets: how do we **strategise and draw in** smarts, collaborators, partners and funds in line with our shared principles\n* **Shared assets**: how do we approach these shared assets - spanning project funds to collective ideas and the wellbeing of the ecosystem as a whole\n\n## Projects and next steps\n\nNOW:\n\n* Now is the time to step up and **show your interest** in the research network's scaling. This is a collective and open effort and collaboration is key. \n\n* I am meeting with the **SenseStack** team @nadia @hugi and @matteo_uguzzoni this week to discuss alignment and pathways\n\n* @alberto @yannick @ireinga @mariekebelle and I are meeting to explore potentially develop and hosting an **Econ sci-fi event** - as per @alberto\u2019s post [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/econ-scifi-can-we-imagine-a-completely-different-economic-system/8534/), this project is being explored as a first higher profile knowledge sharing event\n\n* We are a **subcontractor to a tender** with EuroParl that is being submitted this week and I will continue to explore **strategic opportunities** with the European research environment as per the above posts. \n\nSPRING/ SUMMER: \n* Review acquisition strategy and prepare to scale production pending results of H2020 round\n* Edgeryders **team retreat** where overarching longer term strategies and teams will be explored\n* Architecting and establishing **\u201cplug-in here\u201d process** (Collaborator and partner funnel with 3 steps + explicit social contract)\n* **Documentation** (Repository of projects, proposals and previous applications)\n* Host 1-2 community calls \n* Host 1 reading group (in preparation for Econ sci-fi if go ahead)\n* Host 1 meet&greet (integrate into Econ sci-fi if go ahead)\n\nSUMMER/ FALL\n\n* Test and implement effective and **open project planning tools** in preparation for multiple H2020 projects within the next 12 months\n\n* Econ Sci-fi if goes ahead\n\n* Operational scaling and acquisition campaigning pending Spring/ Summer review", "created_at": "2018-04-30 20:16:17.139287", "updated_at": "2018-05-01 06:48:11.290020", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1337, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 769.4, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [42179], "is_liked_by": [4022, 3, 3811], "is_private": false}, {"id": 69476, "user_id": 3782, "topic_id": 12544, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n**Hello my name is  *Hadeer Ghareeb*  I am from  *Cairo, Egypt* .

So:\n\n\n### A grassroots study of plant-based prophylactics for COVID-19\n\nRun a grassroots organized, placebo-controlled, double blinded study of the effects of various harmless and freely available substances for prophylaxis of COVID-19. Basically mail tablets around (half of which are placebos) and let people report contact numbers, symptoms, COVID-19 diagnosis, severity of disease etc. in a software.\n\nProphylaxis would not have to mean that people don't get sick at all, but that serious cases (and [permanent lung damage](https://www.rainews.it/tgr/tagesschau/articoli/2020/04/tag-Coronavirus-Lungeschaden-Forschung-Uniklinik-Innsbruck-6708e11e-28dc-4843-a760-e7f926ace61c.html)) should be prevented. Multiple molecules have been identified as potential prophylactics, and multiple of these are herbal-based, over-the-counter nutritional supplements that should be reasonably safe for a grassroots organized study like this. Among them are [quercetin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quercetin) and [luteolin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luteolin). For more information:\n\n* [Potential Inhibitor of COVID-19 Main Protease (Mpro) From Several Medicinal Plant Compounds by Molecular Docking Study](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202003.0226/v1) (2020)\n\n* [Small Molecules Blocking the Entry of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus into Host Cells](https://jvi.asm.org/content/78/20/11334) (2004) \u2013 This deals with the SARS virus, a closely related pathogen.\n\n* [Traditional Chinese Medicine in the Treatment of Patients Infected with 2019-New Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2): A Review and Perspective](https://www.ijbs.com/v16p1708.htm) (2020).

It does not seem like any institution is interested in doing any large study on these substances, as they rather want to find therapeutics (and even there, study progress is way too slow so far). So if we want to know, we'd have to find out ourselves.

It took 3 years to learn what to eat, and another 3 to learn the truth of 'you are what you eat' , and at this stage I would assert that you are also HOW you eat, as in - how you supply sustenance to self and kindred. \n\n2016 was the first year since 2008 that I was not hospitalised, and going strong since, the reason for this has been the slow acknowledgement that \"we are the soil\", or in more precise terms, our health depends on the bacterial ecology of the gut and this depends on the health and bacterial ecology of the soil (all of which is 'the ancestor' if you think about it deeply enough). Food shaped food , grown in chemical soup, with only 3 of 62 micronutrients, will not cut it. \n\nIn 2014 I secured the first 8k of funding from Plunkett and Carnegie on their Growing Livlihoods Program,  we started in March of 2015 with a quarter acre under 6 foot of mess and brambles, littered with litter, broken glass, and surface detritus. Beneath all of that though, there was a gold untouched by the chemical agriculture model whose manure had come from organic fields during the 300 year history of its use as an urban kitchen garden. \n\n Today, based on the near-basic-income of a post surgical disability allowance from the government, with passion, hard work, reasonable communication skills, and a whole lot of help in the driving of it, we have a beautiful space, feeding participants in our 'food commons' , and working projects with the community mental health centre, intellectual disability groups, schools, rehabilitative care clinics, and the general public. We also run research trials with DIT's Engineers   Without Borders on biochar, built 9 biodigestors on the island in 8 days with nat-geo explorer TH CULHANE,  welcomed OS Ecology inventor Daniel Connel for wind turbine workshops, grow food for conscious creativity events, started a local cottage market to support small scale producers, initiated a local inter green schools program, a community woodland, a community garden in a neighbouring village, an ecotouristic bee project, education and training with the national education network, etc.-and-ting. \n\nSo far we raised over 20 k for what is a relatively small project, now three urban and social gardens, and are looking to greater heights for the work to come on what will be our residential site at Tullanisk, a three acre walled garden with four bedroomed house, space for a yurt, and rich earth to bring to fruition in the service of the land, it's people, their health, resilience, and joy in what will otherwise be hard times for a country importing 98% of their vegetal foodstuffs.  \n\nA point on the why...Within months of the Normans coming to Ireland it is noted that \"they became more irish than the irish themselves\". In effect, your consciousness is cumulative and you contain billions of 'individual' life forms (there is no such thing as individual but for the whole you see). The normans ate from the soil, and became of the land. This is health and rectitude. The modern human is disconnected from others, from true self, from the land via work and food, and from the earth and all of its depth thereby. \n\nFor quite some time I have urged the tech community to put down roots. To date I have figured out the techniques of doing this, both practical, having trained with the legend Jim Cronin for 9 months, and structurally through time on the Community Land Trust research and development group at the Royal Institute of Architects, Ireland. I currently work with PJ FITZPATRICK,  a leading software and app developers and former high finance exec. whom I met in hospital the last time I was there, me for post surgical rehydration, he to have his bowel removed, a process I had been through years earlier.\n\nThere would be no such things as Crohns,  IBC, colitis, etc if not for our building into the world the shortcomings of our own nature. These are centralist, they deny the value of untramelled nature and simple work, they demand privilege and power over submission to the greater order of this earth, and they will get us all in big trouble in the very short term. We have open and honest work to do in which we take long hard looks at ourselves and what we are at,  take the self-protectorate lens off, and begin to do what, and as, needs be done.\n\n**Things team Edgeryders might note** - a 'venture' was the name given to the expedition of the 'adventurer', who formed a 'company' of mercenaries, and continued to plunder the material resources of others for their own and their masters profit. Those who 'invested' in the 'shareprice' of such 'ventures' divided amongst themselves the spoils of these journeys of rape pillage and murder without thought of the moral 'externalities' protected in the eyes of the law by 'royal patent'. I am not a venturer, nor a company-man, nor an investor, nor do I want any part of it all as one cannot build white houses of black bricks. By your admission of having 'some ideas about non-extractive business models' you openly acknowledge the extractive nature of your current setup. Intellectual and creative resource is little different to the material. \n\nWhile this approach exists, I will take no part in the doing. But if you can approach the Regenerative, and as principle of action, then I will work with you, and train your growers in the how and why of the soil such that they might feed you as you do your thence good work. \n\nWe have site and situation for the training, and it is not only how to x, but as anything connected deeply, it will ever be how to x in relation to the entire alphabet of the present predicament. We also have partners through which to engage higher order structural approaches.\n\nContact me directly at birrgrowery@gmail.com", "created_at": "2017-08-30 10:59:54.547173", "updated_at": "2017-11-13 21:26:04.332062", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1093, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 128.2, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 1457, 3804], "is_private": false}, {"id": 74176, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 13183, "post_number": 1, "raw": "![surveillance_by_Pete_Linforth|690x414](upload://9VhlkNiULhXNB7fp4rcrCBEP3Px.jpeg) \n\nGovernments and tech companies are reaching for tech-based tools to help defeat the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of the solutions under discussion imply restrictions to civil liberties and human rights, like the right to privacy (here is [Edward Snowden weighing in](https://youtu.be/k5OAjnveyJo)).\n\nThis is creating uneasiness in the communities I am a part of \u2013 a disturbance in the Force, if you are a Star Wars fan. People worry, but no one is sure what an appropriate diagnosis and response to the situation would be. Is the situation \"problematic\" or \"dystopian\"? Can we do anything about it, besides worrying?\n\nYou see, there are two kinds of problem. For the first kind, the more knowledge people gain about the problem, the less they worry. For the second kind, the more knowledge they gain, the more they worry. Nuclear power production belongs to the first kind; climate change belongs to the second one. Is government-corporate use of tech surveillance more like nuclear power, or is it more like climate change?\n\nThe puzzle is complex, and no single person seems to have all the pieces. But that does not scare me: I am part of Edgeryders, and In Collective Intelligence We Trust. So we organized a [community listening point to touch base with each other.](/t/13089) It was open to anyone, but we made a few targeted invitations to people who hold important pieces of that puzzle. What follows is a summary of what I learned in that meeting. It is only my personal perspective. I make no claim to speak for anyone else. I offer it in a spirit of openness, and in the hope to contribute to a broad, diverse, honest conversation. Taking part in such conversations is, I find, the main way we humans navigate problems as complex as this one.\n\n\n## About the listening event, and Edgeryders's role in it\n\nThe listening event took place on April 9th, at 17.00 CEST as a Zoom conference call. We made it public through [a post](https://edgeryders.eu/t/a-surveillance-pandemic-a-community-listening-session-on-emergent-post-covid-trends-from-contact-tracking-to-special-powers/13089?u=alberto) on the edgeryders.eu online forum. People learned of it mostly through Twitter. I have taken the initiative to reach out to some people whose opinion I was keen to hear. We discussed for two hours, with 32 to 36 people logged in at any given time. About 18 of them spoke at least once \u2013 I counted 11 male-sounding voices and 7 female-sounding ones. Their backgrounds and expertise was in:\n\n* The legal community.\n\n* The medical/public health community.\n\n* Digital tech. This was the largest group. People declared specializations in the fields of: information security; privacy; digital identity; artificial intelligence; big data analysis.\n\n* Privacy and human rights online.\n\n* Public policy and democratic participation therein.\n\n* Media.\n\nMy colleagues at Edgeryders and I participated as concerned citizens, like everyone else. But we were also working, because we we are part of a project called [NGI Forward](https://research.ngi.eu). Its role is to advise the European Commission on how to ensure that the future Internet upholds our common values of human rights and rule of law.\n\nWe adopted Chatham House rules. So, this post reports what people said, but not their names. The call was not recorded; I saved its chat to help me write this writeup, but then deleted the file. The [information sheet](https://bit.ly/SurveillancePandemic) contains full disclosure about our treatment of information from the event.\n\nI take full responsibility for any incorrect reporting, and welcome any integration, correction or additional point of view. Please respond to this post, and let's improve each other's understanding.\n\n\n## Result 1: there is cause to worry, but also leverage for defense\n\nThere are several good reasons to be on our guard.\n\n* Policy makers tend to overestimate the effectiveness of technology-based surveillance vis-a-vis the pandemic. People spoke of pervasive solutionism (in [the sense of Evgeny Mozorov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evgeny_Morozov#To_Save_Everything,_Click_Here:_The_Folly_of_Technological_Solutionism) \u2013 \"a little magic dust can fix any problem\").\n\n* Digital surveillance companies are treating COVID-19 as a business opportunity. Some of these have dubious track records on the respect of human rights online. In the words of one participant:\n\n    > In the last week, it's been reported that around a dozen governments are using Palantir software and that the company is in talks with several more. They include agencies in Austria, Canada, Greece and Spain, the US, and the UK.\n\n* The public is scared, so willing to accept almost anything.\n\nExample: in Italy, drones are being used to check distancing in public spaces. There are talks of equipping them with facial recognition algos. Is this necessary? Why? Is it going to become a permanent feature in our cities?\n\nAnother example: car manufacturer Ferrari has a plan called \"back on track\". It involves re-opening the factory with a scheme that includes mandatory blood testing and a contact tracing app. Is this the kind of decision that your employer should make for you? What happens if you test positive?\n\nThere are two lines of defense against abuse of surveillance tech:\n\n* Data protection laws, starting with the GDPR. They all state that any data retention should be \"necessary and proportionate\" to the need it tries to solve. This is a weak defense, because all such laws provide exceptions for public safety. Also, governments and corporates have a history of ignoring \"necessary and proportionate\".\n\n* If this fails, civil society can invoke the European Convention on Human Rights. This has its own court, which is not part of the EU, and so it is at arm's length from the EU political space.\n\n\n## Result 2. Contact tracing apps are ineffective against COVID-19, but may help in the next pandemic\n\nEveryone in the call, without exception, agreed that contact tracing apps won't help against COVID-19. The rationale for building one such app, people explained, is to quickly quarantine everyone who got exposed to the first few cases. Once the virus spreads, confinement, as we have now, is a more appropriate measure. It is difficult to think that even the best app would prevent more contacts than people staying at home.\n\nOn top of this, these apps are easy to get wrong. Among failure modes, people cited:\n\n* Data governance issues: possible breaches, difficulty to anonymize the data, and so on. More on this below.\n\n* Lock-in effects: for these app to work, they need 50-60% of the population to take them on. It's a \"winner-take-it-all\" service. There is potential for companies to lock authorities into long term contracts, invoke all kinds of confidentiality to protect their business models, and so on. This situation could prevent better solutions from emerging.\n\n* Loss of confidence: if the authorities roll out an app, and it does not deliver, the public may lose confidence in *any* app. This could happen as new cases rise again after lockdown is loosened, as is happening currently across Asia. This might burn an opportunity to help contain the next pandemic at an early stage.\n\nSo, why is everyone (including several people in our call!) building contact tracing apps? Because there is a political demand for it. It is linked to the end of the lockdown. Leaders are seen as doing nothing, while leaving people behind locked doors. They are eager to provide solutions. This, however, is very tricky to do. Evidence from Singapore shows that contact tracing is not working well to prevent new outbreaks. But what are the alternatives? Political leaders are reluctant to tell people \"the danger is over, go back to your lives\". This is sure to backfire in the political arena if the epidemics enters a second wave.\n\nThis is where solutionism kicks in: building an app can be presented as \"doing something about it\". On top of that, building apps is much faster, cheaper and easier, than, say, retooling the health care system. So, it's a political win, though not an epidemiological one.\n\nSeveral people pointed out that it is not a bad idea to build a contact tracing app. But it is a bad idea to rush it, because \n\n1. To be effective, tracing needs near-universal availability of testing, which is currently not there. Without this, contact tracing need to rely on self-reporting.\n2. To be effective, they also need a large, probably unrealistic, uptake (50-60%, where Singapore managed 12%). \n2. We will not need one until the next pandemic. Rushing development might lead to the deployment of evil, ineffective or broken solutions. One participant had this to offer:\n\n> I am currently involved with a group building a contact tracing app. But I am uneasy, actually thank you for giving voice to my anxieties. I do not see my colleagues discussing the use cases for this tech. I do not see them asking themselves if their solution is going to be effective. I do not see them discussing failure modes of the technologies. Almost everybody is hiding their head in the sand about the consequences of these solutions, intended or not.\n\nSo, the consensus in the group seemed to be for channeling tech repos\n\n> To keep it simple, most \u201cobvious\u201d solutions in an emergency turn out to be counter productive. [\u2026] You need to do your emergency homework in advance, and trust the experts. So for my contribution, I would argue you send every \u201cdevelop an emergency app\u201d/\u201cdo-something-itis\u201d developer to work on *future pandemic* solutions, rather than give them reign in a crisis.\n\n## Result 3. Immunity passports are an unworkable idea\n\nAnother idea that is making the rounds is that of [immunity passports](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/immunity-passports-could-speed-up-return-to-work-after-covid-19). The group agreed that they can turn into a civil rights nightmare, As one participant said:\n\n> They are going to be basically \"passport to civil liberties\". There are going to be a lot of perverse incentives around them.\n\nOne perverse incentive that came up:\n\n> Would that not create a huge incentive for people to go out and get infected, so they can get natural immunity? So nobody would want to do distancing, and we do not flatten the curve.\n\nOver and above such concerns, it seems unlikely that immunity certificates would be effective. Issuing certificates means that having capacity to do massive-scale testing. We do not have that. If that capacity was there, we would be much better off in fighting COVID-19 with traditional anti-epidemic protocols, and not need immunity certificates. The medical professionals in the call also reminded us that we do not know how immunity works with SARS-CoV-2. How long does it last? Does it prevent reinfection, or only make it weaker? So, it's not even clear what you would be certifying.\n\n\n## Result 4. Locational data are impossible to anonymize, and of limited utility. Capacity for data governance is bad\n\nParticipants agreed that it is not realistic to promise anonymization of locational data. A [famous 2013 study](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep01376) shows that human mobility traces are highly unique. Four datapoints were enough to de-anonymize 95% of individuals in a large cellphone operator dataset. As one person put it:\n\n> I never trust a policy maker when they say \"this data is going to be anonymized\". They do not understand what anonymisation means. And any solution will increase the amount of data in play.\n\nAs explained above, people were also sceptical on the usefulness of locational data in fighting the pandemic.\n\n> I do not think that you get any useful information from these apps. They will show that people get infected in places, like supermarkets or hospital, where people HAVE to come into contact with each other.\n\nOne participant offered these apps could help in assessing the efficacy of containment measures. That does not require granular data, but only pre-aggregated statistics. A [recent paper](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/03/30/science.abb6936.full) on Science argues that it is possible to do this securely. The EFF has just released a [policy proposal](https://github.com/BDI-pathogens/covid-19_instant_tracing/blob/master/Policy%20forum%20-%20COVID-19%20containment%20by%20herd%20protection.pdf) on this solution.\n\nThis was the one part of the conversation where I felt I could add my bit. After ten years of open data activism, I am pessimistic on the ability of EU governments and companies to do advanced, ethical governance of large datasets. The daily data on confirmed cases, hospitalizations and deaths are a mess. No standardization, no metadata, collection criteria that keep changing. Belgium, for example, on some days (but not every day!) reports on the same day the sum of two dishomogenous quantities:\n\n* number of people who died in hospital on that day, confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2, plus\n\n* number of people who died in the \"last few days\" in retirement homes, not tested ([example](https://www.rtbf.be/info/societe/detail_coronavirus-en-belgique-suivez-en-direct-la-conference-de-presse-du-centre-inter-federal-de-crise-11h?id=10479728)).\n\nOther example: the former head of Italy's pension administration authority deplored the lack of open data on unemployment benefit claims. Scholars and policy makers themselves are flying blind, with no reliable data. How can we trust people who cannot maintain a Google spreadsheet to steward a massive trove of sensitive locational data?\n\nA silver lining in all this is that contact tracing apps were battle-tested ten years ago. This means we have open datasets which can be used to model the impact of public health measures ([example](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/fileadmin/user_upload/research/centres/risk/downloads/crs-sao-paolo-virus-pandemic.pdf)). If the goal is modelling, there is no need for more surveillance.\n\n\n## Result 5. Where to look for (pieces of) the solution\n\nPeople offered several suggestions for where we could look for solutions, or at least improvements.\n\n* Medical and public health practitioners insisted on good execution over innovation. The WHO protocols, although devised for flu-type viruses, are well suited to coronaviruses as well. But their deployment was late and sloppy. Even at the time of writing, most EU countries cannot test at scale; they cannot provide adequate equipment. The medical community sees this emphasis on tech as misdirection. Part of any solution is to do public health well, without cutting corners. One participant from Italy remarked:\n\n    > For example, we closed schools and universities, but did not inform students that they should not be hanging out with their friends. We did not tell students from different cities and regions to go back home. The rules are simple: if you are ill, tell your friends, and tell them to get tested. But in Italy it is hard to get tested, so the whole protocol fails. Contact tracing is the last thing we need. It is useless from a public health efficacy point of view, and not proportionate.\n\n* Other participants highlighted the positive of labor-intensive \"boots on the ground\". A participant from the UK remarked:\n\n    > I am worried that people fall off the cracks, because they are not on government databases and we do not see them. Maybe they are disabled, but have a job. They never touch the state, and fund their own care. I am worried about people with learning disabilities, for example. If you are not on social media, you have not seen the messages of your local authority, telling you where to get help.\n\n* Several people remarked that the tech community can have the greatest impact by playing a support role. They identified three areas to do this in. One is supporting what doctors are already doing, for example remote diagnosis or e-mail prescriptions. Another is supporting community organizers \u2013 another example of \"boots on the ground\". The third one is the people manning the supply chain.\n\n* The tech community might find an important role to play in protecting the most vulnerable individuals from the worst consequences of the pandemic, and of the measures adopted to fight it. This was not mentioned in the call, but rather proposed in the ensuing online discussion. \n\n[quote=\"eireann_leverett, post:23, topic:13183\"]\nDare I say that if tech wants to make a contribution, a great way to do it, would be exploring the causal factors behind why minorities communities are being hit harder or perhaps not receiving the help required during this pandemic.\n[/quote]\n\n* There was agreement that it might helpful to lift IPR restrictions. We found one nice example in Italy, where a SME [3D-printed respirator valves](https://www.industriaitaliana.it/isinnova-stampa-3d-di-valvole-per-respiratori-polmonari-componenti-meccanici-e/) that could not be obtained on the market fast enough to save lives.\n\n    > We contacted the producer, a multinational, and asked them for the CAD file. They expressed reluctance and would not reach a decision. There are protocols, safety concerns. These are doubtlessly important. But there were people in need of saving, so we went ahead and reverse engineered it. [...] We have not been sued so far.\n\n* Several people suggested that studying history (of epidemics, of technologies, of health and technology policies) could be useful. Solutionism has been with us for a long time (at least since the 1950s, according to a participant). Studying its successes (not many) and failure modes (many more) might help us not make the same mistake twice.\n\n* And finally, people called for more patient, open deliberation.\n\n    > The dialog between the technologically possible and the politically acceptable needs to be had. Immediately it will be done by the elected politicians, that is what they are there for. Then, we should be moving to broader participation. We should be building technology for participation, as much as we should be building technology for tracing.\n\nAmen to that. :-)", "created_at": "2020-04-11 09:17:34.077365", "updated_at": "2020-12-17 14:18:48.747126", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 3006, "wiki": false, "reads": 61, "score": 6177.2, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [74461], "is_reply_to": [74461], "is_liked_by": [5, 8, 6413, 5209, 4861], "is_private": false}, {"id": 42628, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 8197, "post_number": 11, "raw": "I am still on the hunch that, for me, got started almost 20 years ago. when I first discovered mailing lists: modelling social dynamics.

It was phrased as \u201cbeen toying around\u201d, and as a suggestion to Owen, not a hard requirement. Had I known that you were adamant about it, it would have been a very different story.[/quote]\n\nThat's how I roll. I make an earnest suggestion, and if it does not work I'll step up the game. No need to tell people what to do as long as I can persuade them. In this case I basically forgot to follow up on the issue for too long :expressionless: \n\n[quote=\"hugi, post:56, topic:12063\"]Since the namespace already contains a [myriad of seldomly-used tags](https://edgeryders.eu/tags) and appears very ad-hoc, it seemed to me that this implementation would not mess with any carefully constructed order.[/quote]\n\nIt is not *yet* in order. :blush: Some tags are properly chosen and documented ([see](https://edgeryders.eu/t/-/6647#heading--3-3)), otherwise it's just chaos imported from Drupal, with chaos added on top. When I find a bit of mindspace, budget and time for it, @anu and me will certainly clean it up.\n\n(I deleted hundreds of tags already, but it doesn't show \u2026)\n\n[quote=\"hugi, post:56, topic:12063\"]For reference, I read this strong encouragement as being about using YAML rather than JSON in the config file displayed with the webkit.[/quote]\n\nOk, hmm. Never thought of that way to misunderstand it, but indeed it's possible. Communication is hard. Nevermind \u2026\n\n[quote=\"hugi, post:56, topic:12063\"]but is it also true that other selection mechanisms are as easily exposed with an endpoint as tags?[/quote]\n\nYes. If you can make a SQL / ActiveRecord database query to select topics you want from the database, then you can make an API endpoint to expose them.\n\n[details=\"tangential rant: API redundancy\"]\nThis reminds me of the other discussion I got involved in regarding the webkit: that adding any redundant API endpoints, like for topic selection by tag, is not a good idea in my view. Because redundancy is never a good idea.\n\nI don't care strongly about this part, as it doesn't mess up what Discourse users see. So do how you like \u2026 but maybe think about it again. Because I'm pretty sure that kind of software architecture will come to bite you later. It's implausible to me why you would want to add something *redundant* to an API \u2013 a \"nicer\" interface for a special-purpose application or caching before there has been an established practical need for caching are not compelling reasons to me.\n[/details]\n\n[quote=\"hugi, post:56, topic:12063\"]This could be a way of doing it, yes. But it is a bit harder for the end-user applying tags to end up on the webkit. It means the instruction to the end-user becomes a little bit more complicated.[/quote]\n\nAgain, I'd not see the webkit as a kind of fancy editor for text that should appear on websites. Sometimes it will have that role, but its USP is building websites from *organic* Discourse forum content. That's its true power: enabling content-rich, dynamic websites with very little manual creation and maintenance effort. And for that, mechanisms like multi-tag topic selection will be needed at some time. But not necessarily now.\n\n[quote=\"hugi, post:56, topic:12063\"]For example, a specific curation of articles for a slider on the webkit for a specific purpose \u2013 like showing an interesting cross-section of different Edgeryders projects. In this case, we need to be able to somehow mark these topics and the most out-of-the-box way to do that is with a tag.[/quote]\n\nThe most out-of-the-box way for this use case is a reference to a topic ID in the webkit site's configuration file. Tags or other mechanism on the Discourse side are only needed when Discourse users need the ability to add or remove content. For content where the selection of topics never changes in the foreseeable furture, references in the webkit config file are the easiest way to go about it.\n\n[quote=\"hugi, post:56, topic:12063\"]And if we don\u2019t use one topic per session, we also can\u2019t use the events plugin, which means that we lose access to good features like enforcing the date formatting we need to display on the front end.[/quote]\n\nIn the YAML/JSON-in-Discourse-posts method, you can enforce it using a JSON schema (also mentioned above somewhere). There is probably a YAML equivalent of that.\n\nAnother argument against the one-topic-per-session and one-topic-per-bio approach is the user experience of the editing process inside Discourse. Right now there are for example two tags #webcontent-ngi-summit-2020-bio and #webcontent-ngi-summit-2020-bio-small. Probably they have redundant content, such as the speaker's picture. That's an argument for reading the full set of data from one place and displaying pieces of that as required.\n\nJust try editing biographies etc. for two hours here in Discourse, and think if you like how that works, or why not. When doing the NGI Forward website, the first to fetch content from Discourse, I noticed that the user experience on Discourse is important. Basically, how easy it is to find and navigate the web content, and how easy it is to do the most frequent modifications.\n\n[quote=\"hugi, post:56, topic:12063\"]Hmm, but you can suppress a category for showing up in \u201cLatest\u201d, right?[/quote]\n\nIndeed. Didn't know that option, it might be a recent addition. Note, it's not set for [the category you mentioned](/c/workspaces/webcontent-sandbox).\n\n[quote=\"hugi, post:56, topic:12063\"]I think it might be the case that the curation for the summit will be quite different in nature than the curation we as Edgeryders care about, for example.[/quote]\n\nEven if; that set of curated articles will still be a good basis to build on after the summit. Tag naming is a signal, foremost, to the user of the Discourse platform. (Because that's what the feature is designed for, and hacking it is fine as long as it interferes with that original use not in significant ways.) If you can name the same tag differently so that it becomes more useful to the forum user, there's little reason against it.\n\nThere are always multiple ways to do it right. Hope you get the general idea of why I'm arguing against interventions on the Discourse side that are geared towards pushing content to one single, special-purpose website. As much as possible, it's better to make the website *pull* content from Discourse that is either totally organic, or made for the website but marked in ways established in Discourse, or known to the software via its configuration file by topic and post ID.", "created_at": "2020-03-07 20:19:50.076599", "updated_at": "2020-03-07 20:19:50.076599", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1171, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 11.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [71032], "is_reply_to": [71032], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 72770, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 12953, "post_number": 12, "raw": "this was such a nice experience, especially after the past few weeks of nothing but shitty news .

Other events that <em>have </em>been documented include Improving Reality in Brighton, again by Nadia, Unlocking the potential of the social economy in Rome, by Maria, Emrgent Festival Berlin, by Dann, and the RGS-IBG Conference, by Kei.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-02-08 14:54:06", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:36.452682", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 197, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 10.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [14825], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 70342, "user_id": 6195, "topic_id": 12420, "post_number": 3, "raw": "hello, Hadeer for your answer, actually I'm a graphic designer and I worked on design projects and media, not on marketing, marketing is  a part of every project I did because in every project we have to do a communication strategy if you want I can send to you some of my projects and also my cv which I have a little description of every project  thank you !\n\nLe ven. 24 janv. 2020 \u00e0 18:57, Hadeer Ghareeb via Edgeryders <contact@edgeryders.eu> a \u00e9crit :", "created_at": "2020-02-16 17:38:09", "updated_at": "2020-02-16 17:42:08.337101", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 86, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 36.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [69308], "is_liked_by": [5547, 6078], "is_private": false}, {"id": 35056, "user_id": 1935, "topic_id": 6818, "post_number": 2, "raw": "[text-direction=rtl]\n\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0643\u0645 \u064a\u0627 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u0648\u062f \n\u0627\u062d\u0628 \u0627\u0631\u062d\u0628 \u0628\u064a\u0643 \u0641\u0649 \u0627\u064a\u062f\u062c\u0631\u0627\u064a\u062f\u0631\u0632 ....\u0645\u0645\u0643\u0646 \u062a\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0643\u062a\u0631 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u0634\u0631\u0648\u0639\u0643 ...\u0645\u0645\u0643\u0646 \u062a\u0643\u062a\u0628 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u0649 \u0628\u0631\u062f\u0647 \u0645\u0641\u064a\u0634 \u0645\u0634\u0627\u0643\u0644 \u0639\u0634\u0627\u0646 \u0646\u0639\u0631\u0641 \u0639\u0646\u0643 \u0627\u0643\u062a\u0631  \u0648\u0646\u0639\u0631\u0641 \u0645\u0645\u0643\u0646 \u0627\u0632\u0627\u0649 \u0646\u0633\u0627\u0639\u062f \u0628\u0639\u0636 \n[/text-direction]", "created_at": "2017-08-30 11:55:34.524247", "updated_at": "2017-08-30 11:55:34.524247", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 34, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 6.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 48367, "user_id": 4607, "topic_id": 9140, "post_number": 10, "raw": "[quote=\"alberto, post:1, topic:9140\"]\n. This is interesting in itself: does the economic system need to be one? Can we have several ones that coexist? Can people move from one to another?\n[/quote]\n\nThanks! I've been lurking for a while but I'm deeply fascinated in both this topic and participating in Turkey. Bear with me as I was up late watching the US elections!\n\n So I started from one of the last prompts in your original post \"Does the economic system need to be one? Can we have several ones that coexist? Can people move from one to another?\"\n\nI immediately thought of the economic shift away from feudalism - and the Medieval conception of person-hood which didn't see the individual entirely as himself but through the group he belonged to; his(her) worth was only manifested within his social group, in particular the lord/authority over him(her)self. In that time, most people were serfs: if you occupied a space - land - your body essentially was indistinguishable from other property. It was a non-market reputation economy so to speak where serfs didn't have the honor/privilege of nobility and thus weren't considered persons as we consider them today (define along a particular amount of agency or rights); on top of that, in this economy they were indentured by default since their very existence depended on being able to work land that wasn't theirs. \n\nAll of these more dystopian economies I mentioned embody (pun intended?) a return to a feudalism of sorts, where there's severe inequality and oppression because most people forced into indenture (or very easily fall into it) to those that 'control' (or have the means to control) the very things keeping them alive: organs, (alive) time, agency (in the case of the Unincorporated Man). \n\nSo, I guess, I was bringing a question about reputation-based economies: what happens if there's no liquidity or easy attainment of reputation? If the market is distorted by a cartel or monopoly, does this automatically lead to oppression or inequality? And more importantly, if reputation is intrinsically tied to a particular 'worth' of your body, what is the interplay between body integrity/personhood and your reputation worth?\n\nWe already see insurance companies assessing people based on their personal risk, with clear economic and social penalties. Would we want that transposed over the whole economy?\n\nA below passage from the 'The Repossession Mambo' that might be interesting to illustrate the social conundrum. \n\n---\n\n> During the repo training seminars, they threw a basketful of statistics our way; out of the thousands that fell out of my brain as soon as they entered, one managed to stick in there: At any given time during the days before the Credit Union made widespread artiforg implantation possible, there were 120,000 people in the United States alone waiting for someone or another to die off and give up the goods. And despite the impressive methods with which many folks knocked themselves off during those years, there were never enough donors to meet the requirements, so a staggering number of citizens\u2014some good, some bad, all dying\u2014got sent on their way for want of a few organized cells.\n\n> But my point is that this is an anachronism; today, only the very poor or those who have abused their credit to the point of criminal activity are unable to secure loans for their artiforgs. Some cut-rate houses even cater to those with less-than-stellar credit histories, attaching their material goods as collateral. Heard about one place overseas which lends out Jarviks by the boatload, and all you have to do to get one is sign a note of indentured servitude of ten years. Decade of work for a new lease on life\u2014that\u2019s not a bad trade.\n\n>So when the Credit Union people approach with a ream of paper and a pen, the instinct is to clam up and sign, sign away.

With that in mind a design process can be used as an exploratory path - to draw a picture of where we want to go. There can then be a conscious selection process of what (if anything) do we want to execute and to what degree. Execution can deviate from the design and that deviation can be a conscious choice. Without a design as reference that cannot be a conscious choce and you can wonder aimlessly in execution (as many open-source/community efforts I have witnessed do).\n\nBecause our resources are limited I believe we have to be even more caring about how we use them?

They have a DIY lab in the back where they host workshops and artist space. The collective consists also of groups dealing with architecture, urban transformation and gentrification working with the neighborhood.\nTuce works as an independent curator and art writer, and she's originally from Turkey. She deals with archives, posthumanism, transhumanism. Into the idea of hacking as a tool for artists in different ways.\n\nOther guests - @uwe, who is in Berlin for 4 years and has an interest in Cultural Hacking - grassroots evolution achieved by different means: communication, honesty workshops, improv workshops, different ways of relating.\n\n@orangejon, who is using design thinking tools and background of UX and software design to create events, peer learning/ social events to achieve authentic human connection. He is in a transition phase - recently moved back to Romania, Cluj, a city with many interesting people and an IT industry. He wishes to take the success he has had with these events, supercharge them with technology ie machine learning and use it to solve climate change (ecological awareness, connecting on a bigger scale, other species, plants and nature and feeling value which we don't automatically get in urban life). One of his projects are introvert-friendly events. \n\n**Gideon Smilansky** (to join the platform) is an artist, a painter with a background in cinema studies. He runs an artist space in Tel Aviv. As he likes to tell the story - they put a hole in the wall in a southern unpopular part of the city and it became very successful. It has since transformed into a 650m art institute and turned out to be a learning process. Running a space was foreign to the collective, as they were the first of this new wave of artist-run space. They have to figure out how to run a space, how to curate, how to make up a team, what does it all mean?\n\nAs they progressed, they settled on creating hubs: with teaching space, an exhibition space, etc - an art institute. They have studios, workshops, exhibition space, run collaborations national/ international. The collective consists of 10-15 people and a nonprofit with everybody really giving their time - The Alfred Cooperative Institute for Arts and Culture.\n\nHow to build such a thing, from scratch, bootstrapping, without any knowledge?\n\nThe knowledge is implemented immediately, takes intuition and a big chunk of luck.\nThis establishment was like an icebreaker - they had to deal with not only understanding how to give value to our field, or making it up, but dealing a lot with registration, policy-making. This idea of a cooperative was not a legitimate status when it started. As a result, the project has impacted Israeli regulations and has changed it, so that public money could be given to such establishments. \n\nThe Artist-Run Alliance is the main research of the Alfred Institute, since a year. We managed to establish a platform which maps artist-run initiatives around the world. It's also a marketplace for opportunities which arise out of these initiatives.\n\n## Artists are not very well educated or wish to have experience in management. And there is no well-organized knowledge transfer of all the experiences independent cultural. We would need to have a forum for that, a resource center. \n\n**Jonathan**: I come from a needs space (more design oriented) I think there is some value to explicitly surface needs - both because it's interesting, but also because other people can fulfill them.\nPeople naturally think in terms of solutions - they tend to need some re-framing or prompting to figure it out.\n\n**Gideon**: I'm walking you through the story. If we were now finishing the story - looking into the future is to say: we've achieved those things, let's stop and re-think the rules. For us, **giving visibility to needs could be the starting point for the dialogue. Our biggest wish. Researching and resourcing knowledge is not a step that's been properly done.** And yet people spend PhDs studying sentences from Kafka (:-)))\n\nFrom an emotional standpoint, sometimes it's helpful to have a reflection done by someone outside the team. What happens is that the team takes so much energy from one another, that it becomes a mirror maze, and it could really disrupt your prospects for looking outside.\n\n## If you're an artist, you should be doing art. If you're putting your time into the establishment, then you're not well positioned for recognition.\nYou have a class, a workshop, everybody builds their own, one after another, so it's very centered on the individual. The pinnacle of your career is the solo exhibition. It's a lot about ego and individuality. For these people, the creative process works best when they are alone. Like mathematicians.\n\n**Jonathan**: Should the definition of success change?\nPrior to engaging with that thought - first to show that even your idea of success is having an int career and showing your art to a lot of people; changing the idea of success should be done in a non-academic way\n\n**Noemi**: what is best for someone to put their efforts into?\n\n**Gideon**: Building this alternative value: something we historically know - ie the feminist's struggle. Berlin is great not because of Gemalde, but the cultural playgrounds it creates. \n\n**Jonathan**: In terms of cultural change, I still don't tend to talk about the few individuals who have made great work, but about the organizations who have achieved something together. That surely matters to how we think about success.\n\n## **Gideon**: In collectives, very few people make art together. They actually stress the the point of not making art together.\n\n**Tuce**: being in a collective means that you are meeting on the common ground. In Istanbul in the 1990s we saw artist collectives flourishing again; some had amazing ways of doing exhibitions in a squatted place. Now everything is commercialized. But there has been a short, great moment in the early 2000s - my collective members said: we are a collective, we have a venue, and we won't show our own works, we'll let young artists in. That lasted only for 3 years, because it was too much of work. All these people said: we are artists, we want to produce art.\n\nWhat happens after you lose the space? 3 possibilities:\n\nYou're turning into an institution\n\nOr you die\n\nOr you accept to be in this fragile, precarious situation\n\n## TOP is an association renting out the space; as a tenant, they have to sustain the space - often without funding. In Berlin, every year 15 artist-run spaces get 30K prizes. We got it 2 years ago, and it helped them cover some of the expenses up until now. \n\nThis space exists as a project space for 10 years. But to sustain it, we turned it into a co-work, where each member pays a monthly fee and can use the space for events as well. We don't have a core group to spend the time to write the applications. So the existing model works because none of the people uses the venue too much - the space is just an addition to their work. \n\n**Gideon:**\nGreat case study - people do not value their potential, or the space, to its full. The gap between the potential and the value is big. The value proposition of the space to the international community is not as big as it could be.\n\nIf I ask someone/ an artist here a question - a curator, writer, artist - for them this space could be a jumping point to places they want to be in their career. But they are not integrating their needs in the way that they visualize this space. One of the reasons - there is no strong narrative that helps them to do that.\n\nAt an Art fair, which I recently visited in Stockholm, there were representatives of 15 artist-run spaces from different countries coming and everyone there was telling this apologetic story about how shitty their space is, how difficult it is to sustain it. This is a constant reflection to the asset holders - then they start to understand the value proposition they (could!) give, that it&rsquo;s higher than they thought.\n\nKey point needed in this field: a reflection about value needs to be done by the third party; in order for them to start thinking on a higher level of efficiency. Then it stops being this pocket project. Money is not the reason that most artist spaces fail:\n\nMost of the people in artist-run the spaces are engaged either in their own work or curating projects of people that were in the same status as them. That generates cultural value. But one person said: look, we must not only generate value to young artists, but also to young curators because they are going to be the people who build the next generation of shows in our locality. That's where this space started to move forward, stronger impact and reputation. He understood what other people didn't. The space members need to have more flexible and creative approach about the ways in which you create value.", "created_at": "2019-05-27 16:19:37.803196", "updated_at": "2019-06-24 08:36:32.106327", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1571, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 57.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 36542, "user_id": 2201, "topic_id": 7144, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Would love to do this, but I don't read/write well in Arabic...@alberto \n\nWhat is arabic needed for?

It is like a line in the sand. To cross on either side is to jeopardize the stability of that group. Robert Frost illustrated this concept in the Mending Wall. \u2018Good fences make good neighbors.' \n\nIn our efforts to embrace diversification we have not paid proper heed to those who would like to embrace their individuality. integration and diversity are great, but as a construct, they should not be used to reduce the individuality of any group. If a group chooses to insulate themselves from diversity then it should be their choice. It should also be respected by others without considering the individuals to be racists. Diverse lifestyles should be respected on par with segregated lifestyles by honoring the choices of the people who live those lives. In the end everyone wants what they feel deep in their hearts is best for them and their families.\n\nThe problem comes with oppression. When any group of people try to force their ideals on another person and desecrate their life choices. Whether it be a feminist trying to destroy the hijab, a white supremacist trying to impose a false superiority on other races, or a liberal and diverse group trying to take over a town founded and cultivated by white separatists, it is all wrong. And when someone tries to destroy your way of life, directly tries to destroy it, then you should fight back. By any means necessary.\n\nWhere this line gets gray is when one community has profound dependencies on another. Example, when an insulated white group has benefited from excessive amounts of diverse labor to build their ideal community. Well, there is a price to be paid beyond simple salary. Now there is a since of entitlement that mus be compensated. If it is ignored then it will lead to revolt. \n\nEvery people should be deeply involved in the process of securing a successful future for their people.  But, when another set of people use the entirety of your resources in order to propagate the future of their people, there becomes a feeling that the indentured party should have proper access to what they built. Whereas those who it was built for claim exclusive ownership. This is the case in many urban US cities. This is a platform for conflict.\n\nIn the end the problem only exist in shared spaces.

Had come across your [venture agreements handbook](https://handbook.enspiral.com/agreements/venture.html) some time ago - it comes to mind again as we move into the next phase of an initiative we are working on. Would be interesting to have a chat if you have time\n\nThe work we are doing in the OpenVillage is to develop a model of entrepreneurship that enables large-ish groups of people who do not know one another, to work together in getting a critical mass of healthy businesses off the ground. Usually in a situation of low-to-no cash available up front because you cannot or do not want to rely on VCs or grants. By healthy we mean: regenerative for  the individual participants as well as for the ecosystems in which we are embedded. The geographic focus of our work at the moment is the Eastern Mediterranean and Africa.\n\nAfter a couple of rounds of attempts to support \"free form\" collaboration through sharing experience and advice online, gatherings, residency programs, fellowships etc we found that a more structured, guided process was needed for catherding, peer mentoring and collaboration building. As well as legal frameworks for how this can work taking into account the vast differences between the regulatory frameworks, business culture, languages etc that we are navigating.\n\nAt the moment @zmorda and myself are stewarding the first iteration of this process in the form of an online peer to peer incubator program, the [OCI Lab](http://openvillage.edgeryders.eu/oci/). We managed to raise funds to cover the first round from the World Bank - but the intention is for it to become fully self-sufficient without external financing.\n\nThe focus this year has been developing the format and curriculum: at the end of february we will have a first round of \"graduates\" from the program. \n\nThe next step is a collective exploration/learning/building journey into the legals, economics and culture making. Might you be up for a community call hosted by @zmorda and myself sometime in February?", "created_at": "2020-01-22 08:04:35.661363", "updated_at": "2020-01-22 08:04:35.661363", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 351, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 57.2, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [69140], "is_liked_by": [4934, 5538, 4448], "is_private": false}, {"id": 86521, "user_id": 6658, "topic_id": 14593, "post_number": 21, "raw": "Dear candidates,\n\nThank you for your applications.

I think we are close to a solution based not on hearsay, but on documented knowledge.\n\nFirst of all, it turns out that the theme is treated in the 800 pages Horizon 2020 guidelines, precisely [here](http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/docs/h2020-funding-guide/grants/grant-management/keeping-records_en.htm). Following the link, you eventually hit on a [timesheet template](http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/legal/templ/tmpl_time-records_en.odt) with the minimum information required. The accompanying text is the following:\n\n[quote]\nFor persons who do NOT work exclusively for the action, the beneficiaries must:\n\n* show  the  actual  hours  worked,  with  reliable time  records (i.e.  time-sheets)  either  on paper or in a computer-based time recording system.\n* Time  records  must  be  dated  and  signed  at  least  monthly  by  the  person  working  for  the \naction and his/her supervisor.\n* If the  time recording  system  is  computer-based,  the  signatures  may  be  electronic (i.e. linking the electronic  identity data (e.g.  a  password  and  user  name) to the electronic validation data,  with  a  documented and secure  process  for  managing  user  rights  and  an auditable log of all electronic transactions)\n\nTime records should include, as a minimum:\n\n * the title and number of the action, as specified in the GA\n* the beneficiary\u2019s full name, as specified in the GA\n* the full name, date and signature of the person working for the action\n* the number of hours worked for the action in the period covered by the time record\n* the supervisor\u2019s full name and signature \n* a reference to the action tasks or work packages of Annex 1, to which the person \nhas contributed by the reported working hours. \n\nInformation  included  in  time-sheets  must  match  records  of  annual leave, sick  leave,  other leaves and work-related travel.\n[/quote]\n\nSo, here's my proposal.\n\n**Alternative 1: fully electronic** \n\n1. Time-tracking happens with FreeAgent. People log in with their own FreeAgent user, which should replace the electronic signature of the collaborator.\n\n2. We write some tools to save the timesheet in CSV form or something (this is for providing excel sheets to the consortium coordinators).\n\n3. The timesheet is downloaded in PDF format by the team leader that the collaborator is reporting to, or an Edgeryders director if the team leader is not herself an Edgeryders director. The timesheet as exported from FreeAgent already contains all information we need: the grant number can be added to the project title, for example `\"NGI Forward 852652\"`.\n\n4. The director signs the document electronically using DigiDoc and her Estonian e-ID. This generates a `.bdoc` file, which is essentially a zip containing the timesheet's PDF and the metadata: this file was signed by Ms. So-and-so, Estonian ID number 12345, date.\n\n5. Even more solid: the PDF (however generated) is digitally signed by *both* the collaborator and supervisor with the Estonian ID and DigiDoc. This can only happen when the collaborator is also an Estonian e-resident. But in fairness, Belgian cards should also be supported by the Estonian system, and anyway [Belgium has its own system](https://eid.belgium.be/en/what-eid). Maybe other countries too. \n\nThe weak point of this is the first step. It is unclear if FreeAgent has \"a documented and secure process for managing user rights and an auditable log of all electronic transactions\". The Estonian bit is, I think, bulletproof.\n\n**Alternative 2: paper**\n\n1- 3 as above. Then, the collaborator prints  and signs the timesheet, and sends it physically to Brussels, where an Edgeryders director countersigns it and archives it. \n\nWhat do you think, @matthias?", "created_at": "2019-01-24 16:37:49.675914", "updated_at": "2019-05-27 16:01:40.441699", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 617, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 162.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 72577, "user_id": 3622, "topic_id": 12984, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Just added the call tag so it shows up, also need to put the end quotation mark for the info bit. :)", "created_at": "2020-03-26 16:09:51.040639", "updated_at": "2020-03-26 16:09:51.040639", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 21, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 27.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4934], "is_private": false}, {"id": 74596, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 13204, "post_number": 3, "raw": "", "created_at": "2020-04-19 13:25:55.100803", "updated_at": "2020-04-19 13:25:55.100803", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 6.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26641, "user_id": 3165, "topic_id": 5953, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Mea culpa</b>\n\nHi,\n\nYou are right to be disappointed.

(And I'm not sure about the prices of the Indian-made models, they are probably more expensive than the advertised ~2500 USD.)\n\nA major reason is also that the roaster would be designed for 16 hours of unattended operation per day. Commercial roasters are only as large and expensive as they are (often 30-300 kg per batch) to get fixed cost degradation for the human worktime involved. That changes when the machine can roast on its own batch after batch \u2013 then, the machine can also be smaller and cheaper.\n\nIt seems that this new paradigm of small but automated machinery has not yet arrived in the roaster business world.

At the moment the main meeting places have ceased to function, the chuch has broken down and no-one can afford to go to the pub, its shameful but its true. The antidote is placemaking. We feel connected somewhat to a 'real-world' situation, but most are left to isolation and to fanciful illusion and this is not only morally and ethically wrong, conequentially it is dangerous.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhy is it important to have a place to go? There are many reasons, the most primary is information exchange. One man or woman shouting from the rooftops is not much good to anyone, there is a community communication at work in all natural systems that generate complx order from the seeming chaos of the random, we can all appreciate that by now if we choose to investigate. Currently, If we have no collectivelly established glocalised communications infrastructure that is cohesive then we are in trouble of largescale fractionalisation of different interest groups, using various fragmented communication structures with no general cohesion. In informational terms its a mess and in terms of actual life it is disconnection, basically what we have here, us on the internet working for a world we are not part of and us in the world working actually which seemingly has little to do with the world of information and more to do with emotion.\n\nIf this divide is as pervasive as it seems then it should have some function, and the function has to serve the well being of everyone involved in such a way as to promote their mutual understanding. Over on P2P at the moment they are talking about all moving to one place ion America...well thats like us all moving to Brussels and its bullshit really...definitely in terms of a singular solution. We have to get around the ivory towers and to do this requires exceptionally acuitous foresight and the appropriate design to go with it, basically, it requires more than one mind can muster and demands the facilitation of collective processes that turn information into action through communication in hands on work across the board- whatever that means to you.\n\nIf 'boredom breeds the devils work' and fear is the opposite of love then communication and activity are the remedy to stagnation. Confidence is reflected light as is anything else, if there is no trust, no community, then there can be no confidence, therefore a signifdicant key to all of this is to establish communication and mutually supportive structures. Dumb silence will not do, and peoples fears of inadequacy can only be overcome in the experiential case of that not being true , which is condition dependent. The myth of the the mechanically self-contained self is a joke, we are more than self-actualizing here, we are mutually self-actualizing according to an experience based lesson in collective consciousness. (the genie is out of the bottle , get over it !!! )\n\nTo engage community we do what we are now doing except with our two feet and a finger for doorbells in the real world. We are not trying to generate support for ideas we come up with in a lab, this is equivalent with architects fucking up the environment with their emotional creations being slotted into a shared world, it has poor effects on the perception from all sides. We have to design solutions based on the problems in the area that we understand from the perspectives of a balanced set of the age spread and gender distribution of the area of concern. Action, short of divine, is always a reaction to something and so its necessary to tune the will to the collective rather than run around barking 'orders'.\n\nInvolving the community in the design of the website...do you mean the local on the ground community or the edgeryder community? In the case of the former there is the possibility of local features by virtue of collective mapping and communication at the local level generated by this process, I have layed out my contributions on this here:\u00a0 http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/community-heroes/mission_case/what-do-you-want-new-edgeryders-platform-software#comment-4285\n\nBalancing individual with the collective successes demands further thought the question itself is already premature because we first need an understanding of the 'options for' engagement. I mean there is everything from crowdfunding, through social finance and philanthropy, to localised fund raising initiatives and everything in between and thats just in terms with coming up with the resources, the resources will only attract around a design, a plan, and so we have to ask what successes are you talking about? How are they to be achieved? What distinguishes a personal from a social initiative? Do you imply a market based solution as in soc.ent. activity in contrast\\addition to a\u00a0 cooperatively owned social business layer, or is it more of an impetus to plan along the lines of partnering EU funding with personal projects for 'public benefit' , because if this is the case then what is the reason for reinventing the wheel?\u00a0\n\nI dont like carrots and hooks, I like possibilities, and like art and beauty, their worth are assessed in the eye of the beholder. We cannot assume that certain things will appeal to all people, they won't. But, we can safely say that certain tools appeal to certain social groupings, be they politicians, artist, or bankers, and taking those into account will put everyone on equal footing because the work is already being done from so many routes of approach, for now they are all disparate, but not for much longer. Creative social financing can work with tools from the political domain such as EU funds/tax redeployment, with the impact investment and philanthropic communities through their social investment funds and grants, with the general public online through culturally engaged and viralised crowdfunding strategies, and through local engagement with community development of social financing methods which include all of the older methods of fundraisers and local community events dedicated to local social investment. All of these various routes can and will meld.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-11-15 17:49:02", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:25.601289", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1183, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8289, "user_id": 2201, "topic_id": 4522, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Welcome!</b>\n\nMarhababik @Driss, so glad to have you on board and looking forward to check the projects you will be suggesting for <a href=\"/t/case-study-adventures-armenia-belarus-egypt-georgia-morocco-romania-and-ukraine/4374\">case studies</a> in Morocco.\u00a0\n\nAdditionally, do not hesitate to ask me if you need any help.

Bartletts recent essay [Courage Before Hope: A Proposal to Weave Emotional and Economic Microsolidarity](http://richdecibels.com/stories/courage-before-hope/courage-before-hope.html). It rings incredibly true to me, and follows my experience closely of what I've observed being the successful factors in our community in Stockholm. I highly recommend it.\n\nIn short, it's a systematic approach to form socially cohesive groups that can achieve economic momentum. He outlines a template to form crews of 3-8 people, and how congregations of up to 200 people can act as incubator for people to form such crews. \n\nIn Stockholm, we've managed to build a very strong congregation, and there is an increasing apatite for people to form economically viable crews built on the trust and culture we have.\n\nI think Richards model is good enough that I'd like to take it for a test run. At the [Blivande house](https://edgeryders.eu/t/blivande-house-and-studio-beta-sneak-peek/9123), I would like to hold space for people to find their crew. I would also encourage them to also tie it to the Edgeryders congregation whenever that might make sense for them. In the meantime, I will also try this method with  a few crews of my own \u2013 a crew around the Participio development lab, and a crew around finding avenues for Edgeryders collective intelligence and sensemaking consulting in the Nordics.

I've been at the annual meeting of the Balaton Group for the past week discussing the rise of authoritarianism in an age of ecological fragility with some of the world's leading earth scientists, environmentalists, modellers and systems thinkers.\n\nThank you for your inquiry. Let me see if I understand correctly what you're asking. Are you asking if I see room or leverage for CILAS to engage with initiatives and actions taken on the ground? If so, I think you're absolutely right to suggest so. When I first conceived of CILAS I imagined a tripod: one leg dedicated to intellectual inquiry (or Discussion-Based Learning), another leg dedicated to experiential learning (or Experience-Based Learning), and the third leg to applied learning (or Project-Based Learning). \n\nCILAS has learned how to strengthen, that is contextualise and adapt, the first pillar or leg of the tripod. We have seen and studied both the importance and difficulties of working with text regardless of the language it is written in. It appears to be of importance to practice close reading and writing of text, to cultivate an appreciation for different styles and forms of writing (academic writing, prose, poetry, to give a few examples), to be able to read between the lines and perhaps most urgently to smell bullshit in one's own and in others' writing. There is furthermore the issue of language which considering the politics of knowledge production dominated by the lingua franca of our era. Considering the cultural and intellectual imperialism of the anglo-saxon world, most of our knowledge is produced and consumed in English. As Arabic native speakers we need to appreciate this fact and come to terms with it. In other words, we need to improve our English to be able to access much of the insight. Of course, this is not enough and needs to be complemented by efforts to translate into Arabic as well as co-create knowledge in Arabic. Those are some of the issues I consider important with regard to the first pillar or leg of CILAS.\n\nAs for the second which promotes Experience-Based Learning (EBL). I consider EBL as important as Discussion-Based Learning (DBL). EBL is engages with what lies beyond the textual format. Any forms of knowledge that are not written down, black on white and frozen in time. In other words, EBL is about engaging with both  audio-visual and embodied modes of inquiry, or forms of knowledge. That includes songs and podcasts, visuals and paintings, film or motion picture -- both fictional and non-fictional -- as well as the exploration of spaces or environments, be it on foot, on a bicycle, car, bus, carriage, sail boat or plane, to give a few examples. Experience-Based Learning is about movement. It is about moving and being moved, be it at the gut level, that is to say from within, or from outside, that is to say the exploration of what lies out there.\n\nNow comes your question about the third pillar or leg which aims at translating the insights gained from engaging with text, analysis or interpretation, and the exchange of ideas or discussion as well as the experiences gained from engaging with the audio-visual and the spatial into projects or applications. Any act of translation is a delicate act. It is delicate because as a translator you create and give meaning. In other words, you exercise creative freedom and express generosity. Both creativity (as opposed to productivity) and generosity (as opposed to greed) are undervalued by the neo-liberal market. How do you make or create applications in our day and age, and in particular in the context of Cairo? I suppose this is how I would re-phrase your question. Please do correct me if I'm wrong. The answer I'd give is that applications or Project-Based Learning would have to figure out ways to be co-creative and socially inclusive rather than necessarily productive (measured in terms of monetarily) and exclusive.\n\nThis is the short answer. I need to get back to the conference now. Let me say a bit more later. I'd be grateful for any comments or questions on this initial reflection.\n\nHug\nKarim", "created_at": "2017-09-18 16:19:35.010050", "updated_at": "2017-09-18 16:19:35.010050", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 717, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 72.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [35855], "is_liked_by": [1935, 3729], "is_private": false}, {"id": 74598, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 13226, "post_number": 18, "raw": "I registered us.", "created_at": "2020-04-19 13:40:06.492085", "updated_at": "2020-04-19 13:40:06.492085", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 3, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 27.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [74430], "is_liked_by": [2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7498, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2539, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>So who are they?</b>\n\nWow. \"Bridenapping\". :-( Thanks for sharing.\n\n<span>These Change Your Opinion people are clearly future builders in the STF sense.

Erin Westover is the European market lead at proptech company Upflex, which has seen an uptick in queries during the crisis, with organisations deciding to make a move toward distributed work.\n\nUpflex works with established companies that have staff working remotely and allows employees to see which co-working spaces near their homes are free. Westover said before the crisis she needed to explain the technology and its importance to clients but now people are aware of its merits and are showing more interest.\n\nThe fact that the company\u2019s technology allows its users to enter and exit co-working space using their phone as a key, is really relevant at a time when public health is a priority and contact free ways of doing things are encouraged\n\nSimilarly, Jonny Cosgrove, the founder of [meetingRoom.io](http://meetingroom.io/), which provides virtual reality meeting room software that focuses on collaboration for smaller groups of three to 20 people, has seen an increased number of sign-ups during the crisis and a lot of interest from coworking spaces who are sensing the change.\n\nAs many workers have become \u2018Zoomed-out\u2019 in recent months, Cosgrove offers a solution that focuses on human communication ncompassng oral communication with body language and space.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be an Edgeryders\u2019 summit without plenty of questions - we will be exploring further how we can retain the connectedness we have built during Covid -19 going forward.\n\nGary O\u2019Meara who is the chairman of the National Association of Community Enterprise Centres, co-working spaces in Ireland, and one of our speakers at the event. He has made the point that Covid 19 has helped us become more connected: \u201cHow can we build on that?\u201d\n\nMaybe the answer to that question lies in Faye Alund\u2019s thoughts that the power of community to \u201cactivate initiatives and make them more successful\u201d should be utilised in coworking spaces.\n\nFaye is the president of Coworking Indonesia, a community-focused coworking space of entrepreneurs and social activists, and will be one of our speakers at the event.\n\nMayur Sontakke is an owner of a coworking space in Goa, India. Like Faye, he is of the opinion that co-working spaces need to focus on community to prosper. Within his space, he focuses on community, customer services and building relationships.\n\nAnother coworking owner will also be speaking at the event - Nacho Rodriquez, based in the Canary Islands, Spain. For him coworking spaces can do more than just bring a community together, they can also bring affluence to certain areas that may not have attracted industry. With his long term plan is to extend his offerings to more rural locations.\n\nJoin our summit on July 21, by signing up [here ](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/how-to-support-the-recovery-of-the-coworking-sector-a-virtual-summit-tickets-111403930154).\n\nFor more information on our speakers read [this](https://edgeryders.eu/t/how-to-support-recovery-of-the-coworking-sector-an-online-summit-bringing-together-key-industry-figures-and-wider-sector-participants/13987) thread.\n\n\n---\n<image>![Weekly News (3)|690x388](upload://7X44lD05XKxxYIWTIVpPd1Omzgo.jpeg) </image>\n\n### Join Edgeryders\nSign up [here](https://edgeryders.eu/c/campfire) to: \n* \ud83d\udcac Find the right conversations \n* \ud83d\uddd3\ufe0f Get invitations to our events\n* :open_book: Learn & build new knowledge \n* \ud83d\udee0 Co-create new projects and programs\n\n\n\n</Text>\n</Content>\n\n---\n\n<Content id=\"Support our work\">\n<Text>\n\n##  You can help.\n\n**Get in touch.** Edgeryders can support the work of changemakers in more than 80 countries because people like yourself support us with knowledge, contacts and resources.\n\nContact us on [Email](mailto:nadia@edgeryders.eu)  /  [Telegram](https://t.me/joinchat/JawU61gzONdIftzzvAyvUg) \n\n \n\n\n</Text>\n\n</Content>\n\n---\n\n</Webkit>", "created_at": "2020-07-03 10:53:13.371134", "updated_at": "2020-12-15 19:54:58.152799", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 787, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 16.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 80981, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 11380, "post_number": 9, "raw": "I fixed the Graphryder dashboard installations.

This is not a bad place to highlight some of the differences between our old Drupal and our new Discourse. Note that an \"official\" explanation [is planned](https://github.com/edgeryders/discourse/issues/16) along the way, but for now my own understanding will have to do. As always: if you want to get more involved in building all this, the doors are wide open. Just let me know. Our customised Discourse is also itself open source and available at https://github.com/edgeryders/discourse. \n\nThe development and maintenance approach underpinning the platform is this: \n\n1. Start from an open source solution that is good at what the community does _most_. What we do most in Edgeryders is seeking truth by comparing experiences and debating them. So, Discourse. We get plenty of goodies out of the box, including, for example, an intuitive way to keep track of what's going on. When you logged in, you saw a small blue number close to your avatar (top right): that's a visual cue that one thread you have been active in (this) had been updated (by me), and you might want to check it out. Also, there are features like \"new\" or \"latest\" (which are misnamed in part, but [we'll fix this](https://github.com/edgeryders/discourse/issues/24)). And don't get me started on autosave. Sweet!\n\n2. Anything else we want bad enough, we will code. This turns out to be much easier than with Drupal, because the code base is so much smaller and because Drupal has plenty of cross-module dependencies. At the same time, adding features should not be too easy, because feature creep. This forces us to be economical and to \"live close to the code\", in the same way that traditional farmers live close to the land and know that, if they overexploit it, there will be hell to pay.\n\nSo: \n\n\n### Usability\n\nDynamically generated pages are difficult in Discourse, yes. But that is not a problem, because the community does not seem to be clamouring for them. We (meaning Edgeryders itself) do need pages on the platform that do not fit the Discourse mould. Edgesense and its younger cousin [GraphRyder](http://graphryder.opencare.cc) are a good example. So, [we develop for them](https://github.com/edgeryders/discourse/issues/4). In general, the new platform will feel, and be, more minimalistic. Some things will simply not be possible. Those that are possible will hopefully be easy and intuitive.\n\n \n### Semantics\n\nYou are attempting to map Drupal Commons entities onto Discourse entities. But that's not where the action is, because Drupal entities were always a compromise. Everything fit in them by definition (since the old platform was Drupal), but that fit was not always easy. So, what we tried to do instead is fit Edgeryders activities as we see them into Discourse entities. \n\nWe started from refocusing on our 10-years goal: building [OpenVillage](https://edgeryders.eu/c/open-village), our little open source utopia. That means doing two things: overcoming specific **challenges** (for example: how to build open source insulin?) and running complex **projects**, which encompasses several challenges (for example [OpenCare](https://edgeryders.eu/t/introducing-opencare/33), of which OpenInsulin is a part). \n\nNow: \n\n* Projects were \"meta-groups\", and recently a custom content type called \"challenge chains\". They are now top-level categories\n* Challenges were groups, and recently a custom content type called \"challenge\". They are now sub-categories.\n* Drupal nodes of all types are now topics. \n* Drupal comments are now replies.\n\nThat's it. \n\nA few loose ends:\n\n* I am not aware that our Discourse has a groups feature. There is a sort of \"implicit grouping\" based on interest: if you are contributing to a topic, or simply watching it, Discourse considers you a member of the ad-hoc group running the thread, so it will send you notifs, etc.\n\n* Discourse tags we plan to use in several ways. The most important one is to support OpenEthnographer and our own data strategy ([this short paper](http://bit.ly/digital-ethnography) explains what we are already doing and, how we plan to scale it another order of magnitude).", "created_at": "2017-07-23 09:18:17.601301", "updated_at": "2019-03-07 23:58:14.039945", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 699, "wiki": false, "reads": 26, "score": 95.2, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [33507], "is_liked_by": [1543, 2567, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 47348, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 9029, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Thanks for the offer, @sirine_b, and welcome to Edgeryders.

I have translated an [interview with a Swedish historian](https://www.svd.se/historiker-coronafester-ger-inga-pluspoang-har) explaining the cultural reasons for why Sweden is facing this crisis so differently than other countries.\n\nA couple of additions from personal observations:\n\n* A majority, around 60-70%, agree with the current way of doing things. At the same time, a very vocal minority is very upset and feels that this is reckless. There is constant debate around this in Sweden. So, while this article describes a general point of view, it is not universal.\n\n* Sweden has some of the best domain knowledge in the world. Stockholm is home to the ECDC, and its founding director and former Swedish chief epidemiologist Johan Giesecke has strongly supported the Swedish course of action in the media. \n\n* Ironically, I think we are also being protected by a pathology in Swedish society that I have spent a lot of my time trying to counter \u2013 [our individualist and socially distant lifestyle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n12Z9gKbI6Y).\n\nI have not posted this because I agree with everything this historian is saying, I don't endorse all of his views on \"Swedish exceptionalism\" but I do believe that he captures well why Sweden is behaving differently than the rest of the world. I thought I would post it here to provide another data point for to integrate into the sense-making.\n\n> Sweden stands out as the world's only major industrialized country that handles the new corona virus without tough restrictions, coercion and isolation requirements. Countries are amazed and appalled by the Swedish solitary position in the viral crisis. \"The picture that is given is a kingdom of invincible Vikings,\" writes the newspaper Le Monde.\n> \n> A dozen other media in the world report similarly, according to a review by SvD. \"People over the age of 70 are simply asked to stay home,\" France Info notes with surprise. Corona-affected Italy goes a step further. \u201cSweden swims against the current in an irresponsible way. Nordic modelling is a dangerous mistake, \u201daccording to La Repubblica.\n> \n> The British Financial Times calls Sweden's road a \"unique public health experiment\" while The Guardian reports that Sweden \"plays Russian roulette with its citizens\", and Swiss Le Temps amazes that \"in Sweden life goes on as usual\".\n> \n> The Swedish line is also noticed in Argentina, China and the Middle East. \"Sweden seems to live in a different world, and believes that the virus can be eliminated by giving citizens some simple instructions,\" writes Argentine newspaper Clarin Mundo. China Daily reports on \"unexpected cultural differences\" between Sweden and the Nordic neighboring countries, and Al-Jazeera is completely in awe of that gyms are open as usual in Sweden.\n> \n> The prestigious American magazine Foreign Policy has an in-depth article about the \"business as usual\", in Sweden. \u201cAlmost all Western countries have come to the conclusion of shutting down their communities - but one big exception stands out: Sweden. The Swedes seem to expect that their national culture can cope with public health threats that other countries cannot, \u201dit says. It is aghast at that Swedes who have just returned from skiing in the virus-infected Alps are now planning to travel to \u00c5re. The New York Times also writes about global wonder over the relaxed Swedish line.\n> \n> Rarely has Sweden and Swedish politics received so much attention in the outside world and been challenged so brutally for a public health strategy. International inquiries now rain over the Public Health Authority. Everyone has the same wonder: why does Sweden go against the current?\n> \n> Swedish historian Lars Tr\u00e4g\u00e5rdh is a specialist in Nordic welfare models and Swedish social values. He says that Sweden's actions are based on deep-rooted traditions and social structures.\n> \n> \u2013 First, there is a deeper trust in public institutions in Sweden than in other countries. It is not blind faith that make us obedient citizens but the belief in expert authorities who in turn trust the citizens. It is a matter of mutual trust.\n> \n> Therefore, Swedish authorities believe that it is enough to make recommendations such as staying inside if you feel ill and avoid large crowds. \u201cUse your brains,\u201d says Lars Tr\u00e4g\u00e5rdh. In other words, classic Swedish freedom under responsibility. May also be called common sense or sense of duty.\n> \n> Secondly, he thinks, the Swedish exception can be explained by the ban on \"ministerial rule\". It is a deeply rooted rule that goes back to Axel Oxenstierna's time in the 17th century when the foundation was laid for the Swedish state apparatus. This means that Sweden is governed, de-facto, by expert authorities and not directly by the government. Politicians who want to show strength in tough times should keep their paws away from unpolitical institutions whose decisions are based on skills and expertise.\n> \n> \u2013 This runs very deep in Sweden. Elsewhere in the world where one does not have this strict rule, many politicians now take the opportunity to prove themselves as strong leaders and impose harsh prohibitions, especially if it is an election year.\n> \n> This rule is also stronger in Sweden than in neighboring countries. This may partly explain the difference in virus strategy with, for example, Denmark being \"given a more populist political culture\".\n> \n> Thirdly, the answer lies deep in Swedish culture, says Lars Tr\u00e4g\u00e5rdh. In principles that can be summed up in two words: trust and care.\n> \n> \u2013 In Sweden, there is trust between people. When I go outdoors, I assume that others have taken their responsibility and do not go out with a fever or spit and cough on the street. You keep a decent distance. You self-regulate and at the same time create degrees of freedom.\n> \n> \u2013 Trust is good but control is better in many countries. In Sweden, on the contrary.\n> \n> Right now, the Swedish population is undergoing a stress test. It then returns to the typical Swedishness that is sometimes considered a bit boring and mellow, says Tr\u00e4g\u00e5rdh.\n> \n> \u2013 Conscientiousness. It sounds a bit old-fashioned, but if you look at the deep structures in society, this word always pops up. And it is exaggerated in crisis situations.\n> \n> He takes the example of provocative \"corona parties\" organized in some parts of the world.\n> \n> \u2013 It is seen as idiotic in Sweden, and nothing that gives any plus points. There is no party price mentality here with people spitting each other in the face to show how tough they are. Some may misbehave, but the majority act well.\n> \n> \u2013 People also do not run around and are careless in Stockholm. It is calm and quiet. People are careful and considerate. We do this in the context of allowing for greater freedom without breaking institutions and closing schools - a typical Swedish line.\n> \n> At the same time, extensive work is going on behind the scenes before the pandemic worsens, he says.\n> \n> \u2013 Students are carefully prepared for things to be tougher. They are trained to work remotely, given passwords and access to online teaching platforms. At the same time, we are preparing people to step into full time child care and help in a deeper crisis.\n> \n> There is no naive hope that Sweden will get away, says Lars Tr\u00e4g\u00e5rdh.\n> \n> \u2013 But here is another balance between taking care of individual sick people and our institutions and the economy. That discussion feels calmer and more mature in Sweden. In many other countries it is more hysterical and people are horrified by \"talk about protecting the economy when old people die\". That doesn't sound right in Sweden.\n> \n> In addition, a completely different atmosphere is created in society when one assumes that people themselves can manage responsibility in critical situations, he adds.\n> \n> In the outside world, Sweden is known for relatively strong state control from the cradle to the grave. Then why not control with a stronger hand in the corona crisis?\n> \n> \u2013 During the cholera epidemic in the late 1800s and the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s, Sweden was the worst in the class. We took the most draconian and almost horrific measures to deal with these epidemics. People were imprisoned and there was no talk of regard for freedom and individual rights.\n> \n> \u2013 Now there is a need for a greater freedom in society.

What we, as a company, stand to gain from Ourghema's success is two things:\n\n1. We gain a tight relationship with a small, but concrete, achievement in improving a local context in a middle income country. This means we can try to replicate it, adapt it to different contexts, scale it etc. together with you.\n\n2. We gain a potential partner, that can help us bring _other_ Edgeryders products in the region. \n\nWith this in mind, I would like to have time to sit down with both you, Yosser, and with @zmorda to discuss how, in practice, we could strengthen Ourghema and increase its local impact. Courses? Hackerspace? @Dorsaf's biohacking vision (by the way, I would love to sit down with Dorsaf too). Yosser, I would also welcome the opportunity to meet your father and see what he thinks. My French is good enough for this kind of conversation. Zmorda, are you planning to come to Medenine? If not, I can come see you in Tunis \u2013 my flight to Turkey is leaving from there anyway. I would also love to meet @Sohayeb.  \n\nAdditionally, I would like to repeat to Yosser my offer to give a small public event: a lecture, a workshop (on Graphryder and SSNA), something.

Except maybe if you have a well-funded partner organization to get you started and make you well-known. Or maybe by starting alongside whatever you're working in right now and see when it catches on and gets traction ... it can happen surprisingly fast at times, this is a networked world after all, and then that would be the point where you can make it a full-time startup then</span>.</span>\n\n<span>Personally I can relate a lot to \"working for what you care about rather than just having a job\". To me that's a major trait of freedom, while \"jobs\" are often borderline to forced labor ... . That pursuit of freedom / self-determination is also the reason why I am still in the startup world after 6 years of very moderate success.</span>\n\n<span>And that was also the reason why I started to rethink the way we do business, tracing the difficulty of creating sustainable startups back to the scarcity of money as a medium of economic exchange. There's so much wasted time and other resources that we could exchange if it wasn't limited by always-scarce money. So in the end, I developed <span><a href=\"http://makerfox.com/\">a tool to replace money</a></span> :-) (together with a brother of mine and input from the Edgeryders community). It should allow to engage in much more exchange, and could be an in-road for sustainability for all the initiatives that you will inspire your \"clients\" to start. For tax reasons, one will always also have to earn some money at some point, but it should make the start much simpler.</span>\n\nTell me what you think about it ... that Makerfox tool is just launched, so we're also looking for collaborations and ways to make it useful for the people :)\n\n", "created_at": "2014-05-12 12:25:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:49.794129", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 416, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 71705, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 14294, "post_number": 7, "raw": "I am good with topic 1..or 2 or any of them really.

Many have the platform messages forwarded to their own email, so they don't have to log in to ER to see it.  I think if we asked our ER friends and colleagues to go one of those topics to say what is going on from their perspective, a lot of them would do it.  Although it is a big group mailing, I don't see it as spam.  More like we are asking our friends to do us a favor.

With my brother, we realised it\u2019s not the thing to do, quite boring. After this first experience, I moved to France for a Master in Entrepreneurship and Innovation Management. The second touching point for coliving was this: as a class, we were 23 people in a very international group bonding very well, hanging out in the weekends and studying together. I learned what it is to be inside a community. In the student residency it was the opposite, everyone had their studio apartment, but no common areas, so just saying hello and bye on the corridor. I was also working on a student consulting for a coliving in London, and I got to know about coliving. At that time we were thinking with my brother we should do something in Berlin.\n\nWe started Happy Pigeons right after I came back from France, but took a long time. We wanted to rent something, but didn\u2019t find it. The landlords were not convinced. Took us half a year to find something, and in the end, even if it wasn\u2019t intended as such, it was the family business.\n\n![Happy%20Pigeons%203|690x464](upload://gVORzwUEtTw7bLuEX6K7cMgS4BA.jpeg) \n*Photo source: Happy Pigeons Co-living [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/happypigeonscoliving/)*\n\nWe were founding the company in 2016, and the first 3 room apartment was in March 2017, in Prenzlauer Berg. Since then we have been growing organically - in the first house, but also in the 2nd location in Charlottenburg, with 2 apartments for 5 people. All apartments we have are old building apartments, kind of community style. All have common spaces: livingroom and kitchen, as well as 1-2 bathrooms per apartment. You have small communities within a big community. We decided to keep it this way and not have one huge common space - it could have the opposite effect and everyone would stay in their room.\n\n**It was key to us that we want to have a connection to the neighborhood - we know the difficulties here, the tense situation of Berliners thinking \u2018these internationals\u2026\u2019, and the internationals staying in the bubbles.**\n\nThe relative majority of all applicants for Happy Pigeons is German (10-12%), and then international. Those who live here in the first house are an international mix: 4 German people (1 from Berlin), and everyone else came to Berlin. We have between 10-35 application/ week.\n\nThis year we had 450 applicants for 5-6 free spots. It\u2019s very nice, but also very difficult - for processing all. The applications are ongoing, but if we don\u2019t have a free room they get to the waitlist. If we have something we announce it to the people who applied. We decided to have an open application because there\u2019s nice things coming out of that i.e. people who will only use the work space.\n\nThe process to be selected:\n\n1. We have a funnel of 5 long questions helping people understand that it\u2019s about community - people who put time and effort in the application get texted \u2018we have a free room\u2019. We have to pay attention that we don\u2019t take someone who just needs the room and then you don\u2019t see them ever again.\n\n2. The second funnel is a skype interview after which we select the most interesting people\n\n3. The third funnel is an interview with someone who lives in the apartment.\n\n![Happy%20Pigeons%202|690x458](upload://kmAntxRzGgr8y4RxVIAPpxp7roh.jpeg) \n*Photo source: Happy Pigeons Co-living facebook [page](https://www.facebook.com/happypigeonscoliving/)*\n\n**The average turnover for coliving is 8 months. I think that\u2019s a good mix, we have people who stay three years and others who stay three months. We ask in the beginning how long you think you will stay, but then the rental contract is unlimited. 1 month cancellation notice, plus we cannot cancel the contract, it\u2019s their choice.**\n\n\n## What are the common activities and how do people use the common areas?\n\n* Some apartment residents have a weekly community dinner. Once or twice a month everyone comes together:\n\n* Some are involved in the selection process\n\n* We meet twice a month, all together: cooking together, drinking, having fun, going out.\n\n* Once a month we have feedback session, more thinking about what we can do next together. We wanted to do projects together, but it\u2019s not happening yet. It\u2019s more social things that we do together.\n\n![Happy%20Pigeons%201|690x517](upload://6u21X8XRLtAZrsgPWFOM0XiwjVv.jpeg) \n*Photo source: Happy Pigeons Co-living facebook [page](https://www.facebook.com/happypigeonscoliving/)*\n\nFor the common spaces, for example in the first house:\n\n* We have a co-working 9 am - 6 pm, with people from around joining and 3 residents who use it regularly\n\n* We have a common activity space from 6 pm, also public. Most weekdays we have something going on in the evenings - yoga, openmic, stretching, or more prof events like meetups.\n\n* On the weekends it\u2019s mainly for the people living upstairs, sometimes they have a common private party, and mainly the big kitchen is used.\n\nAll the activities during the evening are \u2018self-organised\u2019. Partners have the keys to the space, they come, make their setting and when they leave they prepare the space.\n\nOn the weekend it\u2019s also self-organised - mainly the people upstairs have the keys.\n\n*Do you guys live in the space as well? Tell me about the team and your life/work separation*\n\nWe are here during the weekdays. The team is me, my brother, and a part time community/ operation manager, and we are also thinking of projects together. Why we decided to hire someone? We wanted a new input, Marc and I are pretty similar. We wanted to bring the community stuff at the next level, bring some action.\n\nWe have 2 roles - part of the community, part organising the community. We used to live there in the beginning, to test, for 2 months. But since most of the time we are here in the co-working, it would be too much. We can get called sometimes in the weekend, because everyone has our number. We thought there has to be a separation. Now we have a business phone and whatsapp - with working hours, from 9 to 6, Monday to Friday.\n\n\n## How do people in the neighborhood join the common activities?\n\nWe don\u2019t do advertisements, people find us through google maps (Cowork Prenzlauer Berg). We have a test case -some people really like it, others don\u2019t feel it at all, they want a bigger space, anonymous co-working. The average time for a co-worker is less than co-living, 3 months. Most people are freelancers. For the activities, the yoga/ stretching it\u2019s a friend of mine who was looking for a space, we organise it together. For the singing club, not sure how they found us.\n\nPayments get negotiated on a case by case basis, and it\u2019s an evolving relationship: people can host and maybe develop a client base, and then they can pay a small amount based on their number of attendants. If new people want to do other activities - we say we want to make it fair, so we take 10% of whatever you earn.\n\n\n## Are there rules for living together? If so, who made them?\n\nWe have one poster showing the values in the kitchen and something similar in every apartment. We don\u2019t have house rules in the apartments. The values say indirectly how you should behave. Once we had a small conflict with the 3 room apartment, but they met, talked it through and it was OK.\n\n\n## What do residents say is the best thing about living together?\n\nA mix of being part of a community and have a good start in Berlin, and having cool people around. Everyone is similar in values. And also to have a nice, private small community in a big community. I think our rooms and the whole setting is not a serviced co-living, but the feeling of having a real home. A lot of co-living spaces - everything is planned for you. Here, a lot of things are self organised.\n\n\n## What if the management team would not be there, would it work?\n\nI think it could. You need a couple of people who are really motivated and involved, and then it could be self organised. We are lucky that we have 3 residents that are really involved, and that\u2019s a big help.\n\nIt\u2019s very important for people to feel comfortable, because it\u2019s their home.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Got any question?

Reduce complexity, avoid increasing it. Manage groups rather than individuals or items, automate and generalize \n* Information exists in networks, both tangible and abstract such. Links are what define network structures and thus significantly affect characteristics \u2013 if the network is useful or not. Use ubiquitous linking sensibly to manage information \n* Consider other sensible information practices (e.g. \u201cupstream first\u201d, originator, authority, audience, attention capacity / efficiency, review, transience / permanence, development / momentous / maintenance, relations (links), location, medium, overview, collaboration, cognitive funneling).

Jon is a [professor for creative technology](https://www.dundee.ac.uk/people/jon-rogers) at the University of Dundee, and was just about to wrap up a stint at [Mozilla Foundation](https://foundation.mozilla.org/)\u2019s Berlin office where he had been on loan, so to speak, as a Mozilla Fellow working on their IoT program with [Michelle Thorne](https://twitter.com/thornet). Over a few years they had been running the [Open IoT Studio program](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Open_IoT) during his first couple of years, and just shifted their primary collaborative focus on [OpenDoTT](https://opendott.org/), a EU-funded PhD program about responsible Internet of Things (IoT), jointly run by University of Dundee and Mozilla. \n\nRather than rehashing the whole interview (which ran quite long and you can [listen to here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/edgeryders-internet-of-humans-fellows-interviews-and-podcasts-with-peter-bihr/10423/3?u=pbihr)) I wanted to highlight a few bits and pieces I found particularly relevant, slightly edited for clarity below.

Settle in, grab a cup of tea or coffee\u2026 even the edited version is still a bit of a #longread. Here goes \u2014 enjoy!\n\n\ud83d\udc47\n\nP: In your practice, you come from a design research background where you do a lot of design research these days and think about how that applies not just to to physical products, but to connected products. What was your journey? How did you get there? You did engineering, you did some AI stuff, you did a lot of design research, how did you end up bringing it all together in in this space around IoT-connected products and connected services?\n\nJ: That's a good question. It's something I'm constantly shifting focus on. Essentially, I've always, in my professional life worked between electronic engineering, and product design and primarily interaction design. And actually, the thing that brought me into product design, and interaction design was really that these all have electronics in them, especially if you're thinking of the late 90s. Pre web as we know it. But effectively, electronics were the things in products that did the human interface, and then they converted that into electrical impulses. That was a radio, you press a button, it will change the channel for you. And the channel was in something electrical. So it was humans and technology coming together. And I've always done that. Flitting between them and at times I will emphasize more of the technology research. And at times more of the human aspect. Increasingly, I'm finding, maybe because I'm getting older, that it is harder and harder to differentiate the fields of engineering and design. Actually, I think the lines are getting more blurry.\n \nThey're getting way more blurred, because what the internet did was tell everyone they could make something. And that was the spirit of Mozilla, actually, in its earliest days was everyone can make something. And you know what? People listened. And so Arduino said, How can we do that? And Mozilla was making things like Web Maker and other tools, and all the stuff got people making. So we're all told we can make stuff, right? And so we did. I started teaching that to students in between design and technology studies. And computer science and engineering students would pick up an Arduino and realize that this was amazing. \n\nA the same thing with 3D printing. Rapid prototyping is natural. These used to be engineering tools. They were like CNC machines. And they would sit next to the CNC machine as another way of doing engineering parts. But of course, they slipped into art schools, and they slipped into people's bedrooms, almost unnoticed. And suddenly the thing that was an engineering thing was suddenly some making thing. Suddenly, people who make things are not just engineers, they're all sorts of people. And I think, again, these hybrid bridging technologies are enabling people to do things in this new way. So there is a blurring reality.\n\nP: You mentioned things slipping into our schools and bedrooms. The narrative of things slipping into bedrooms also, of course, is one you hear here often when you talk about systems like Alexa and Google Homes. That is a different kind of dynamic, because they also slip into all parts of our lives, but they're not tools for making. They are not creation tools, they're consumption tools. In the most benign reading \u2014 or surveillance tools if you\u2019re less benign.\n\nJ: I think there's a really big distinction to make here about tools for making. In the 90s, there was a big trend for bedroom DJs. And all the big names now that flood the circuit, and huge clubs all over the world - they all started in a bedroom. Because there wasn't a college of this, there wasn't a formal way to learn this. They also went to art school. So if there's a bedroom as a space for making, and it's yours, and you own that and you control it, and no one's gonna tell you you can't. I think that's where these edgy, potentially paradigm-shifting things come from. It\u2019s where Microsoft came from. Originally it's where Apple came from. And that's very different from consumer products. Coming into the bedroom and the things that are, for me, not things that should be put in without serious caution. And we're actually having the same thing I think with the thing about garages or the extension of a garage or your home, or your local street. Suddenly, even these last few weeks, where did all these E-scooters come from? And why was the one parked next to my bike this morning? I couldn't physically move this thing, and it's blocking my way. It's really weird. And I've seen kids around the park bobbing around on this thing in the park last night, they certainly weren\u2019t over 14. \n\nThese things are happening in different contexts in ways that we don't know. You know, you might say scooter: mobility. I might say mobile mapping device. Hugely invasive. That thing knows stuff from just the behavior of how it's been spun around or stopped. So that's the reality for teenagers. I get into an office district, right in the morning. These are different contexts and different ways of using scooters. So surveillance is now so huge, it wears so many clothes now that it's impossible to see. \n\nP: Like the William Gibson quote where the street find its own use for technologies, only here it\u2019s surveillance capitalism that finds its own use for the streets.\n\nJ: Like the quote from Jurassic Park where it's like nature finds a way, I think surveillance finds a way. And I think humans want to extend the reach of their sensors all the time. They want to do this for good, and they want to do it for harm.\n\nP: So how do you explore these questions? There's like a bunch of inherent tensions in these fields  right between, say, convenience and privacy and across many, many dimensions. It\u2019s like a minefield full of potential friction, right? How do you explore that? I know that once you helped commission a video together with [Superflux (Our Friends Electric)](https://superflux.in/index.php/work/friends-electric/#) and the extended opened-up IoT Studio to network around different personalities, different roles. Can you explain a little bit how that works and why you were doing that?\n\nJ: Yes, there's two things. One, from my perspective it's a very powerful tool in understanding the implications of technology in the future is to give people as near to an experience of being in the future as possible. Now, that doesn't mean putting on a VR suit, stepping into the future at some VR cave in a very expensive lab. \n\nFor me, it is storytelling. And science fiction writers have been doing this for the last 120 years. You brought out a William Gibson quote. We could bring out George Orwell. We have all these imaginative ways that people tell stories. And design is another very powerful way of telling stories, when coupled with filmmaking. So designs that can make props, near or far future technologies that can affect appear in a narrative. And it doesn't have to be a blockbuster science fiction narrative, like lightsabers. These can actually be domestic, ordinary, rather dull futures, the kind of futures that we're really going to inhabit. The future is going to be just as domestic and dull as it is today. The question is, can it be the domestic and dull that we want, or the domestic, and dull that's been forced on us that we don't want. And that's where making these films that can reveal in playful domestic ways, maybe there's a little humor, because people understand more with humor, if you can get across concepts. \n\nWhat we wanted to do in that film was to translate the research findings and complex conversations we had on a research retreat in Bellagio for five days, this is really important process for navigating the futures: Ask experts.\n\nSo how do you get this mess, lots of postings, lots of conversations, lots of notes, lots of typed documents into something that was understandable? One of the people that came was this filmmaker, founder of Superflux. And we asked her ([Anab Jain](https://superflux.in/index.php/about/#)) to work with us \u2014 us being University Dundee and Mozilla \u2014 to create a film around the future, the voice, which is a topic we were discussing in Bellagio. So that film is an embodiment of some of the snippets, and thoughts and reflections we had during and after this five day research retreat.\n\nP: So you gathered a bunch of experts, identified issues, challenges, approaches. Then you had professional speculative design fiction people turn that into a more tangible thing and the result was this video called Our Friends Electric. And it showed essentially three different personalities of voice assistants. One was a pretty controlling kind of nanny that would always ask you to do things. And other one was a kind of quirky, critical socialist or Marxist voice assistant. And the third was a voice assistant that would speak in your voice and could speak on your behalf, and you\u2019d control its mood and attitude.  If you had to call like a phone hotline or something, it would negotiate on your behalf, and you could just give it basic back parameters, like confidence and a friendly or angry attitude.\n\nJ: Do you want it to sound frustrated? Do you want it to sound relaxed? Do you want it to sound funny? Or do you want to sound serious \u2014 we wanted to embed all these and make them human-controllable.\n\nP: The one where you control the emotion, I found that really fascinating. The idea to have to be explicit about what emotion you want to display is so inverse from how we usually experience this, where oftentimes I think we're surprised by our emotions rather than think \u201cOh, I want to be angry.\u201d In this scenario, instead we flip the switch for the device to be angry now on our behalf, so I don't have to. That's fascinating.\n\nJ: And also, if only you can turn yourself down, right. You know, like people say, tone it down a bit. You have a tongue you control. That was where that started to come from. And we also wanted the conversations to feel real. So there is a term in English, the saltiness, from sailors in that particular language. That saltiness on the BBC is allowed to appear after what's called the nine o'clock watershed. So if the BBC made voice assistance, could you imagine the same watershed suddenly, after nine o'clock? \"What do you want me to fucking play now?\"\n \nP: I really love this movie. What was some of the feedback you got? Were there surprising insights when you showed us other people in how they reacted?\n\nJ: Yeah, we wrote this research paper published in [CHI](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3300344&dl=ACM&coll=DL) ([PDF](https://thewavingcat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/rogers-chi2019-ourfriendselectric.pdf)). So what was it like to have this film out there for a year two years and show it to students, design fairs, and events happening in the real world? Six months after we made the film, a voice assistant can make a call on your behalf: Google Duplex was announced. I guess we were six months ahead in a way we hadn't expected to be. But what it made me realize straight away was 'wait - Google Duplex didn't inform the caller it was an AI.' How terrible. That's disgusting. They shouldn't have done that. And that was the big debate. So when that voice assistant was calling people, it wasn't saying Hi, I'm an AI. It was saying Hi, I'm a person. That was wrong. \n\nThe way it said a lot of the things was also in this sugar-coated humaneness. The politeness. It wasn't like, *Hi, can I make a reservation for seven o'clock? Wait, what do you mean, you don't have that? No, I want that. Come on. Come on.* That's a real conversation. Not everyone is polite and hesitant. I've been called by people's personal service assistants. The power relationship is really interesting.  So again, we were able to investigate the power relationship between humans and machines. Which we also did in this film. That's so important. \n\nEverything has a an ideology. And so what we wanted to show was that if you had a voice assistant, you might be able to adapt it to appear like a monster. But if it was run by a capitalist, a company like Amazon, the only real existence is to try and sell you things.\n\nAnd that's the surveillance economy coming back to the ad economy. A suggestion economy. There's new silencing. Machines having ideologies need to be really clear. In an age of programability we need to be able to do that. And ultimately, machines will need to be accountable, right? Accountable to the people that created them. Not just having robot toys for robots.\n\nP: If you think in concentric circles: If you're a user, and you have a device doing a thing on your behalf, that's one thing, that's one relationship, right? Between you and the device, or the device maker, if it makes a call your behalf it likely already affects a third party who might not have consented. So already, we're establishing a completely new relationship. And then there's, of course, all the outsourced kind of externalized costs and external hidden effects that we haven't even touched upon. And that's really a whole new rabbit hole and a huge, huge field, right? That's only slowly starting get any attention.\n\nJ: And I think if you can look at the way in which a blockbuster movie enables you to convince you that this narrative is real, if only in a suspend your disbelief kind of way. Now we see with a deep faith in a very different way. What was fiction is now able to do this, not just suspend your disbelief. These things with the same production values are now going into changing your behavior, right, as they go into changing your mood during entertainment. Imagine those production values of the things that are coming to you. And that they will employ so many different techniques, embedded in different things. It\u2019s really important for the next generation of the internet to really understand these very powerful forces, to start to name them. I don't think we know yet. We call them advertising, but we don't know what they are really, it is new forms of controlling. We've known that we need to enable people to take back control to be able to read, write, execute and participate to be not just consumers, but creators. \n\nBut these need balancing against trust, opportunity, responsibility, ethics, and they need to be done in a way that's back to the person in control of this. And that's hard. Because if I put a 12 year old like my kids in the car, when they were younger they would love to be in control of the radio, then that's fine, but I wouldn\u2019t put them in control of the steering wheel. We've learned so much about dangerous systems in the past flying, driving, manufacturing things, you know, where the safety standards are so much clearer, so much more understood and have been adapted into human customs and behaviors,\n\nPartly because it was slower: Bits of metal were slower to form and communication was slower. The steam engine took a while to spread around the world. The infrastructure for train travel took a long time to build.\n\nP: Cars took a long time to become even somewhat secure even for the passenger, let alone the environment. \n\nJ: Exactly. The systems - control and manipulation - grew up with them. I think what's happened with big tech is that the systems of control and manipulation and law and lobbying and policy to enable your product to get to market and through government control are as hugely sophisticated as the automotive industry. They ported those same people into big tech. But what hasn't been ported is a sense of safety, responsibility, workers rights. All this stuff has been jettisoned. We require new understanding of what have we left behind rightly, to figure out what we left behind wrongly. What do we need to bring back, what new skills and things do we need for this very fast economy?\n\nP: Have you seen any promising approaches? Or do you have a gut feeling where you think how we could even tackle these large-scale change problems? There's a lot of talk about , generally speaking,  social media and all these wrong incentives and all these like public discourse platforms that lead to outrage rather than consensus, how that undermining democracy and the democratic process completely. So the tools are currently not that strong it seems to me.\n\nJ: There's two things we have - two pieces.  One piece we've talked about, where you're able to make films and speculate about the future and tell stories about the future, in a very clearly produced way that is built on expert views from many, many points of view, gets written into a narrative by filmmaker and designed in order to show this to have many different lenses looking in the future. So we know how to do that.\n\nP: So these are essentially objects that you can then coalesce a whole conversation around.\n\nJ: What we then could do is say, okay, we first will use experts to create this vision of the future. But then we need other experts to critique this. So the piece we don't have, and that comes back to democracy and control is, we are seeing powerful emergent techniques around informed citizens, such as the citizens assembly. And actually another thing, which I found out recently with citizen juries: Imagine 12 members of the public chosen at random, and who get to cross -examine experts. So could you imagine these speculative films about the future in a series of 12 or whatever number, get to basically see these films then interview the experts behind the films, also experts that present a counter viewpoint to the film. So in the case of Our Friends Electric, you would show these films, and these would be on trial, the future would be on trial. And then these 12 people come from all aspects of life, completely normal from all across Europe, let's say, Would then be able to interview the people behind the film who made it and everyone who went to Bellagio. They would also be able to call people who would counteract that. So maybe Google Duplex would be there saying what's wrong with this film? Why their Duplex is better. And you could have someone from Facebook say, okay, we don't have to go with a blown up thing. It wasn't what these researchers and the Guardian is saying, and have this thing on trial.\n\nSo why don't we put trust in data on trial, and show what that looks like? Let's show the crimes or the impact; it doesn\u2019t have to be crimes - it can just be what does the future look like different visions for the future? And put them on trial, before the problems have happened. So it's a kind of predicted, not predictive, responsibility.\n\nP: It's participatory prediction.\n\nJ: It\u2019s about future responsibilities and how we in the EU or globally can deal with them. \n\nAutonomous vehicles are gonna ride like scooters, everyone's gonna go. We read about these and we knew they were coming. But we didn't know they were coming next week.\n\nP: And even if we did know that, then unless there's a way to actually participate in the decision making process it doesn't matter.  \n\nJ: Could you imagine like in the old days the cinema had the news before the film, could you imagine if you said, okay, you're coming to see science fiction, you're highly, highly, highly motivated by futures. And we're just going to show you the five minute film beforehand. And then everyone gets to vote on the future with a few questions. And could you imagine how that would be as an experiment - ways of putting things in front of people that start to use people's time more wisely.  \n\nP: Another example that surfaces this issue is Aadhar, the Indian centralized government ID based on finger prints. It frequently doesn\u2019t work for people who do manual labor. The fallback plans for when it fails, like iris scans, are a big problem for people with cataracts. But also some will say well, I don't trust it. I just want there to be a person to talk to. But of course that also doesn't exist. Like so many fallback plans: They always get scrapped. It's like, oh, we have a new shiny system. So everything now works perfectly. But if then anything doesn't work entirely perfectly everything goes belly up. Everything comes to a grinding halt. \n\nYou mentioned that the next generation is really important in this, and you started this PhD program called OpenDoTT. What's up with that? How does it work? What's your goal with that? Because to me, that's a pretty groundbreaking new thing, the way you frame these these PhDs?\n\nJ: I think it comes down to a simple, maybe naive observation of the world and this was a response to a call, which is about identifying gaps in training, where you need seriously strong academic leadership, and have industrial experience to go into this gap in the training. And the gap in training I can see globally. But some way Europe can foster it is closing the gap in the training of how we design for trusted objects within the internet. We don't know how to design for trust. We know, as designers, we might know how to design for reliability, we might design for speed, we might know how to design for people with poor eyesight. We know how to design for so many things. Yet, we don't have design for trust. \n\nSo we realize that this isn't something you're going to tackle with just putting up a 10 week course on a bachelor's program. It's a graduate program that we needed for this intensive training. And that's what we applied for, and won the funding for. We're really looking at this trust, and the internet, across all the physical, different scales that the Internet of Things will be happening. Because on one level it's either on or in your body or it might be in your home, it might be around your home, it might be the bedroom or kitchen. Friends share things in homes. So the homes are important, as is the body. And also we're going to have a kind of informal network and community level. We can say we want some technology in here. And then zoom out again, on the biggest scale, you have things city, this so-called Smart City, infrastructure and so on. And there, things are coming in a different way. And all this is calculated by trust, of which we now don't even know how to read this now, visually, or otherwise have been informed. So we have designed a program designed for trust.\n\nP: That's also what I really appreciated about this is the framing, that\u2019s what I found really interesting. But also you take a clear stand based on values. This is a very opinionated program in a way. It's not just about building sensors, building IoT stuff, but about make it trustworthy. That itself is such a strong frame.\n\nJ: We all have heroes and heroes. One of mine, John Sacra, he's had a lifetime  - 50 years of experience in journalism and design and technologies and big systems. And he just said recently, in an article in the magazine for us: *You know that for all these incredible sensors, and 50 sensor based and open source technologies that are emerging in the world, how much difference is that actually making to people? The icebergs are still melting. And disasters are crashing even faster and closer. So while we're sitting there measuring and being all kind of very self congratulatory about this citizen science approaches, they're not making a difference*. And they're really not. If it was well done, we would have been able to slow down this stuff.  \n\nI want to relate this to another piece which is relating it to trust. The next thing I think, which is if the Next Generation Internet (NGI) has to comply with is all the other work that's going on around climate change and humanity. Is this a human centered Internet of Things, or can we bring being humanity *and* planetary centered into that? Let's not do an iteration, let's do a paradigm shift. So let's not do it to keep the internet things going, it's going to keep going. But let's not just make it more human, let's just make it serving the planet. \n\nWe already have a framework that's been discussed for years and years and years through the Millennium goals, and now has become the UN Sustainable Development Goals, so-called SDGs, 17 of them. Carefully planned so that by 2030, the planet will be in a better shape. The thing I will ask as pushback is, isn't the Next Generation Internet going to be here before the next generation arrives? It's got to be compliant with the SDGs and how much work has been done? As far as I can tell absolutely nothing. So this has to be the priority area of designing for the SDG for the next generation internet. Trust, but plus the SDGs.\n\nP: That's really strong framing because it makes it more easily relatable to policy, which I think is always a huge thing. I see people are now moving from the product itself to, Oh, actually, we need to always go upstream. Always one more step: What's the economic model and its policies around it? What's the regulatory framework? That might be the the peak of that particular mountain, that peak of the stack where you go, Okay, look, if it doesn't fit in the framework of the Sustainability Development Goals, then maybe it's not a thing we can be doing.\n\nJ: On the surface, the sharing bikes, I know, look like something that meets sustainable development, because they're going to have cleaner cities, they're gonna have cleaner energy than, say, a car or a train or bus. But actually, if you really look at them, in terms of leaving no-one behind, this model leaves everyone behind, except the company owners behind it. You can no longer repair these things. We both have bicycles, and I know without looking at your bike, I can take the saddle off mine and put it on yours. If your brakes failed, I can take the brakes off mine and put it on yours. If your tire needed fixing, I could use my punch repair kit right. All you need is a good bike dealer. You could recommend the repair shop around your corner, and they will fix my bike without having to check which model it is. Now, the sharing bikes are doing the opposite. No parts are interchangeable. You can't change the saddle, the brakes, or the lights. So when my bike go bust, you have to throw everything away. So they are not meeting the Sustainable Development Goals. But they're also not reaching the next generation internet goals. They're not reliable or trustworthy. We have no idea what's happening with your data. We have no idea what's happening to the communities that use these and so on. No idea what the app connects to.\n\nP: But we do know that none of them put a premium on privacy data protection, we do know that they don't do the same for sustainability. We do know that none of them make a point of say minimizing external costs through paying a fair labor, we do know they don\u2019t have a sustainable business model. That's why you see these explosions of bike sharing companies and then they all get gobbled up by  one. It's the purest version of the downside of the venture capitalist model. \n\nJ: What the problem is, is not that this is happening, that's just a result of that consequence. My problem is the only counter movements of protest ones, there's no lead by example. So we can have this next generation internet then let's have a set of values as defined by the UN Sustainable Development Goals. And then let's start to create these stories and compare them right through citizen assemblies or citizen juries. Let's have a debate about this. So if you can say, here's a film made about E-bikes, so good from Lyft, or whoever's made them from Uber. And here's a film made by researchers and designers, like as a counter narrative. Don't just leave them as opposition on Twitter and Facebook bubbles, bring them together, and critique and analyze and then draw the best bits out and use policy to regulate and inform so that these companies are not about eradicating these companies. It's about them being more informed, and evidence-based ways of making change.\n\nP:  I read this amazing thing from [Deb Chachra](https://twitter.com/debcha), who in her newsletter just drops this one line, \"sustainability always looks like under extraction, when you compare it to extraction.\" And there's so much in that sentence. lf it's sustainable, it'll just not be as in your face as the hyper growth model that we're so used to. That I found really interesting. Maybe a little slower, a little more humble approach might not seem like it's a fantastic business model that scales from here to Mars. But it's something that we could keep doing without limiting future generations. \n\nJ: With these models, we're trying to bring them back with other forms of resilient sustainability, you know, and ways in which we could do this, we still haven't got it right. Farming is still not a place that probably could ensure it, the lessons of history have been for now, of course, this is affecting wildlife all over the planet. Because of these huge farms that have been grown from machines to harvest and marketers to sell not for people to eat and animals to live with. Again, flipping the framework, if we had all the farming meet the SDGs everyone would be fed, because that means that animals and the environment would flourish with farmers. And we have to look at technology development in the same way.\n\nP: So if I tried to like sum that up the key takeaways: Sustainable development goals should be the guiding framework for all that happens, the Next Generation Internet and beyond. Participatory futuring, if you want to call it that, or participatory processes in evaluating futures, would be the foundation to help us guide within the framework.\n\nJ: I think it\u2019s one of many useful tools in understanding. I'm not saying this is the magic effect. All I'm trying to propose is that this form of future storytelling involving designers and film makers is one incredibly powerful tool to add to many ways in which we academically and professionally evaluate the the world around us and propose futures. So I want it to be given due credit in a broad spectrum approach. Because it has to be right. No one method is going to find this future. It's just not going to happen.\n\nP: Is there anything else you\u2019d like to share?\n\nJ: The main thing I do want to stress is that I don't think that pursuing technology standards first as I have seen in the current NGI approach is going to do anything. I really don't. I think it is a really problematic approach. What we need is humans first, and the planet first. Then find out what standards and cultures and practice fit together in order to exist in that world.\n  \nHumans will find ways of being more human. But if you put technology first humans will find a way find a way around it. Always.\n\nAll these futures exist. The future is a sphere, not a line. And it can go in so many different directions. Why don't we just choose the ones we want to go. \n\nThe other thing I think about the future, which is really, really important - this is a thing I've talked about recently is. I could say to you there's the park next door to here, right next to the office, and I know a particular oak tree right round about the middle of that park. If I tried to describe that oak tree and ask you to navigate, you would probably get somewhere in the right part of the park, because we could say that you'd really study and would get to some oak tree but you'd probably have one of a hundred chances of being at the right one. However, if I took you to that tree, right and said, find your way back to the chair you're sitting on the resident office right now.. No problem.\n\nMy argument for this speculative approach is: let's take people there, and ask them to walk back and see the consequences to where they are now. Because it's always easier to get back from the future to now than it is to blindly navigate into the future with just some advice from experts and standards.\n\nP: Thank you so much for making the time. Thank you.\n\n\n*Full disclosure: I\u2019m married to Michelle, I\u2019m an industry supervisor in the OpenDoTT program, our non-profit ThingsCon is a training partner there.*", "created_at": "2019-12-20 09:37:49.710244", "updated_at": "2020-12-10 15:12:00.665999", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 6111, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 454.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 57024, "user_id": 5248, "topic_id": 10368, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Just checked this out!

We are a social enterprise, dedicated to finding innovations that emerge at the edge of society (hackers, activists, artists) and scaling them up to the mainstream. Most of our clients are international public sector organizations like the World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme, UNESCO.\n\nWe are currently working on a new concept for urban living: a hybrid living-working space that can nurture a social, happy, \"deep green\" behavior in the people that live in it. We call it The Reef. To realize it, we have partnered up with EIT Climate-KIC, Europe's main climate innovation initiative. Climate-KIC has already contributed seed funding to our initiative. \n\nWe would like to deploy the first-ever such space in Brussels. This is because we believe there is an appetite for it, but also for personal reasons: many of us live in Brussels, love the city and we would like to contribute to its continued prosperity.\n\nWe believe this is a great opportunity to rethink urban living, and put Brussels at the forefront of the European Green New Deal that the new Commission has committed to. However, we are aware that, to proceed, we need to build a solid and diverse coalition behind this idea. \n\nWe know you have a deep knowledge of urban dynamics in Brussels.

A team of designers came out with a project for a round display designed for restaurants to represent allergies to food and customers needs in case they are allergic to specific kind of food.\nAfter the post called [AllergoKi | Agile kick off at WeMake](https://legacy.edgeryders.eu/en/allergoki-agile-kick-off-at-wemake), on july 31st a post titled [Allergo K\u00ec | User journey experience, interviews and prototyping](https://edgeryders.eu/t/allergo-ki-user-journey-experience-interviews-and-prototyping/6603) was published. Then a post about [Allergo K\u00ec | How to represent allergens with icons](https://edgeryders.eu/t/allergo-ki-how-to-represent-allergens-with-icons/6615) describing the study on the icons, and on august 10th a post named [Allergies challenging restaurants by open design](https://edgeryders.eu/t/allergies-challenging-restaurants-by-open-design/6605/2) followed, deepening on some social critical aspects about the situation allergic people must face if they decide to lunch in a restaurant. What is really of concern here is the attention to this topic given by people involved or simply interested in opencare represented by a quite above average numbers of [reads](https://edgeryders.eu/c/opencare?order=views). \n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/4/46f3e8cdfc79ac6ea81232007a1fe8780e660b2f.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"542\">\nFollowing Allergo K\u00ec team vision we should develop and disseminate new ways and artifacts to bypass classifications (i.e. socially defined differences) about our daily lives, bodies, disorders and habits. In the case of food allergies the usual and social representation tells about people with food allergies as exceptions of the tacit and shared rule about what should be eaten in a restaurant and how we should behave as \u201cpaying eaters\u201d. We can eat hindi, japanese, italian, tex mex, fast food, but what about serious global issues about food instead of laypeople geography represented by the restaurants? Fast food restaurants are said to be global, but what about global issues about their food when customers ask for a lunch without onion (Star, 1990)?\nMoreover, it is a real contradiction between health global issues and how restaurants shape customers when we pass from the view in the food industry to the one shared by the World Health Organization tells about something that sounds like: we have on one side the \u201cnormal\u201d people, while on the other \u201cthose who cannot eat this or should check labels carefully\u201d.\nFood allergy is a rising global health problem and, as reported on the White Book on Allergy (WAO, 2013), it was in 2013 a problem for 240 million people up to 550 million. In Europe (Mills, et al., 2007) numbers are also impressive and count between 11 and 26 million people interested by the problem. These statistics are of course not updated and the situation might have become much critical. There is concern about GM foods (FAO, 2001). The same White Book includes in the key statements about food allergies: the issue of quality of life of sufferers (mainly children) and the need for advocacy of \u201cstakeholders\u201d that \u201cmust be prepared to meet the needs of patients by enhancing the diagnostic process, the traceability of responsible foods, and the availability of substitute foods, assisting hospitalized patients, and preventing mortality\u201d (p.54). Although labelling such people as patients, the problem is tangible in the healthcare world, but less outside and in the wide social context of food industry and restaurants where it is still considered a sort of exception that may not occur in the daily work routine while is about a growing percentage of possibile customers.\nRead more about Allergo K\u00ec challenge: [https://legacy.edgeryders.eu/en/allergoki](https://legacy.edgeryders.eu/en/allergoki)\n\nFAO 2001 \u201cEvaluation of Allergenicity of Genetically Modified Foods\u201d Report of a Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Allergenicity of Foods Derived from Biotechnology 22 \u2013 25 January [ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/007/y0820e/y0820e00.pdf](ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/007/y0820e/y0820e00.pdf)\n\nMills EN, Mackie AR, Burney P, Beyer K, Frewer L, Madsen C, Botjes E, Crevel RW, van Ree R. 2007 \u201cThe prevalence, cost and basis of food allergy across Europe\u201d.

In addition, it is open source.\n\n* A version of [LibreOffice Online](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice-online/). As listed on that page and explained [here](https://www.collaboraoffice.com/community-en/understanding-the-differences-between-libreoffice-online-code-and-collabora-online/), there are several options:\n\n    * Vanilla LibreOffice online, which lacks integration with a file storage solution as such.\n\n    * [Collabora Online](https://www.collaboraoffice.com/collabora-online/), which is open source software with commercial support (i.e. you pay for support to get access to the code, but the code itself is open source). There is an [online demo](https://www.collaboraoffice.com/collabora-online/).\n\n    * [CODE](https://www.collaboraoffice.com/code/), the Collabora Online Developer Edition. It seems to be the exact same codebase as Collabora Online ([see](https://www.collaboraoffice.com/code/#what_are_the_latest_updates)), just that it \"will warn you when it starts to look like it is being used in an enterprise \u2013 ie. more than twenty documents or ten users\" ([source](https://www.collaboraoffice.com/code/#what_is_code)). Of course, since it's open source software, that can be disabled.\n\n* A self-hosted file storage software with LibreOffice Online integration. About 20 options are listed [here](https://www.collaboraoffice.com/code/#what_is_code), though for our purposes [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) seems best, followed by ownCloud.\n\n* Optionally, other self-hosted open source software that integrates with LibreOffice Online and the file storage solution and allows us to replace Google Calendar, GMail as a web-based e-mail client, and other tools.\n\n    * Out of the box, Nextcloud already comes with the following extra functionality: chat and video conferencing (incl. [mobile](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nextcloud.talk2) [apps](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/nextcloud-talk/id1296825574)), CalDAV backend to sync between compatible calendar applications, CardDAV backend to sync contacts between compatible applications, and a \"Federated Cloud ID\" system that allows to share files and folders with anyone signed up on _other_ instances of Nextcloud, ownCloud or Pydio (I suppose so that they see the files in their _own_ instance).\n\n    * Notably, there is [Kopano](https://kopano.io/). It also integrates chat and video conference calls.\n\n\n## Affordances\n\nWhat we get from this combination:\n\n* Fully self-hosted and \"stackless\" solution.\n\n* Synchronous collaborative editing of text documents, spreadsheets and presentations. The way this works in LibreOffice Online is just like in Google Docs etc.: you see the changes and selection made by others in realtime. There is also \"File \u2192 Save\", but that just means everyone's changes live in memory on the server until somebody saves them (to Nextcloud, for example).\n\n* In-browser editing that works on mobile devices, as demanded above. For that, all text selections come with large handles that can be moved on a touch based device.\n\n* You can download the actual original document format, unlike in Google Docs / Sheets / Presentations where you can only download exported documents (which may look different when re-importing to the Google application).\n\n* Since Nextcloud files can be opened via [file syncing](https://nextcloud.com/install/#install-clients) and [WebDAV mounts](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/14/go.php?to=user-webdav) on a local computer, editing them with the _desktop_ LibreOffice applications is totally possible. To avoid version chaos, we would need a file locking function or convention so that only one person can check out a file for local editing.\n\n* Advantages over Office365 and Google Docs / Sheets / Presentations due to the unusual, image tile based rendering of documents in LibreOffice Online (see this [conference talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0eic6A3yHU) for details):\n\n    * No memory or performance issues with large documents, unlike Google Docs. The browser only renders a few images, no actual text. This creates a small lag when updating content, but not more than when editing Google Docs content in a non-trivial document. Certainly ok to work with.\n\n    * All document look exactly the same in the browser interface, mobile browser interface, desktop application (LibreOffice) and in print.\n\n    * The user interface is essentially the same as desktop LibreOffice, including advanced features like a style editor etc. that are not available in Google Docs for example. Complex dialogs like the style editor are rendered as \"canvas\" elements, which means they are images in your browser, rendered on the server, complete with the Windows UI look & feel. But speed-wise, these dialogs are ok to work with, so there's nothing much against them.\n\n    * LibreOffice Online will not be a buggy nightmare. While there are still a few bugs to rule out, they are all related to the communication with the server \u2013 and that is comparatively simple, with the server sending only images. The server itself is stable software, running \"standard LibreOffice\" with an API interface.\n\n* Options for extension and further developments: since all of this is built around LibreOffice and its Open Document Format, there is quite some future potential for own and others' developments, including the following (that I would personally like to see):\n\n    * Making LibreOffice online respect the LibreOffice desktop application's [lock file mechanism](https://help.libreoffice.org/Common/Collaboration). That way, while one user checks out a document for editing in a desktop application, others can only view it but not edit it, whether using LibreOffice Online or LibreOffice. Or in the case of Calc, [multiple users can edit using the desktop application](https://help.libreoffice.org/Common/Collaboration#Collaboration_in_Calc).\n\n    * Support for collaborative synchronous editing in LibreOffice Calc (which [already works](https://help.libreoffice.org/Common/Collaboration#Collaboration_in_Calc)) in combination with others editing the same document in LibreOffice Online.\n\n    * Synchronous collaborative editing also in the LibreOffice Writer, Draw and Impress desktop applications, all in combination with others editing the same document in LibreOffice online.", "created_at": "2019-01-29 16:32:06.749094", "updated_at": "2019-12-27 20:19:55.493423", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 988, "wiki": false, "reads": 21, "score": 29.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [50307], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2326, "user_id": 115, "topic_id": 2293, "post_number": 1, "raw": "I do not have a call to action in this blog post.\u00a0\n\nI just wanted people to know that some of us are re-thinking the web copy that will explain how a revenue making\u00a0arm of Edgeryders will present itself to the world. As a corporate communications guy, I am especially hands on at this stage of the game and pay close attention to the rhetoric that brands use to sell ideas.

An economy's inaction based on its certainties is creating a global deadlock. Permanent micro-adjustments are no longer enough. Fortunately, intellectuals on all sides reject the status quo and imagine more desirable futures.

Our contemporary economy seems reduced to a sad, uninspired numbers game. Leading us downward rather than forward, current economic thinking has lost the radicality of the Marx and Keynes, and the audacity of the Fourier, Owens and Olivetti. \n\nFortunately, there are still intellectuals on all sides who refuse the status quo and imagine a more desirable future. It is perhaps in the field of science fiction that we find today the newest, most radical and transformative ideas. Far from fanciful clich\u00e9s, SF makes it possible to free oneself from the constraints of habits, to project oneself into the future. New worlds and \"fictional economies\" are emerging under the pen of its best representatives. Very often, they carry within them the seeds of a more just and humane society. \n\nThe Sci-Fi Economics Lab organizes the meeting of the two worlds around an exceptional day of programming. \n\n### \u27a4 A day dedicated to the future with world-renowned speakers \n\nOrganized in Brussels on November 11, 2019, the Sci-Fi Economics Lab is divided into 3 phases open to all. \n* Reclaiming Utopia (14h30 - 16h30 in Kano) Organized in collaboration with Extinction Rebellion, this innovative workshop aims to mobilize our energies to create a more just, greener and more humane economy. \n* The Major Debate (18h - 20h at LesRichesClaires) Cory Doctorow, an essential science fiction author, will give the response to a renowned economist (announced soon) on the subject of the viability of \"fictional economies.\" The conference will also be accessible via livestream. \n* The Party! (21h30 - 01h at La Tricoterie) Because the concentration of energies requires their release, an open stage/jam session will take us late into the night. Bring your talent and instruments!\n\nFor those who wish to contribute to making the event last, a brainstorming session is organized for the next day at the Solvay Brussels School of Economics & Management (14h30 - 16h30). Goal? Produce the topics for articles to be published in 2020. \n\n### \u27a4 A global movement \n\nThe Sci-Fi Economics Lab is part of a more global movement of reflection on the post-capitalist era. It is organized by Edgeryders, a global community committed to building a more humane, more just and greener world. It is supported by EIT Climate-KIC, the largest European initiative dedicated to climate innovation issues. As such, it represents a rare opportunity to influence the political agenda at the EU level. \n\nTo seize this unique opportunity to transform our economy, help us with our crowdfunding campaign.

If this is not an ethical dilemma for the Prime Minister to negotiate, I don't know what it is). If you have read some Edgeryders mission reports, you will have noticed that there is not a lot of trust in organisations - be they institutions or companies.

It would be ideal to own a building, or be donated one, but I would settle for renting, it is more important that the space exists.\n\n4) I would need to be able to give my full time and energy commitment to the project for a couple of years.

I wish you continued process along this path, or any other that you may choose. \n\nI cannot speak for Edgeryders, or anyone else really. But I find it hard to believe that any human cultural tradition can lead to living in harmony with nature. We belong to a species that has [driven the megafauna to extinction wherever it touched land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapiens:_A_Brief_History_of_Humankind) \u2013 and we are not speaking of modern adventurers with guns, but of hunters-gatherers with spears. That, according to the latest interpretations of archaeological evidence, existed in an almost constant state of warfare to keep density below one person per square mile ([reference one](http://books.google.com/books?id=y_XD7KHgGWkC&pg=PA177&lpg=PA177&dq=leblanc+%E2%80%9Cas+the+city+folk%E2%80%9D&source=bl&ots=ntUHi8ntQu&sig=axP0-BKlJeIeza0WCC4f-U83mmk&hl=en&ei=xvA6Su3LGIfGMpSevagO&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1), [reference two](http://www.economist.com/node/10278703)). That has an [innate preference for in-group individuals](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10543.html) (\"those like us, not those others\"), demonstrated by research on children as young as six months (this is the biological kernel of racism and discrimination \u2013 and we all have it). This is rape, not harmony. Extraction, it seems, is at the very core of our species's success. Non-extractive _homo_ have gone extinct. We are the descendants of the best slash-and-burners.\n\nAs for ecology, nature thrives wherever man leaves it alone. The Chernobyl radioactive disaster area, just about human technological folly at its worst, has [thriving wildlife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_the_Chernobyl_disaster#Studies_on_wildlife_in_the_Exclusion_Zone), with lynx and bears and bisons and wild horses (wild horses! In Europe!). This has led elder ecologist Stewart Brand to [suggest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_Earth_Discipline) that mega-cities are the greenest solution for hosting homo sapiens. If you love nature, he says, set her free... of your presence. \n\nThis in no way diminishes the usefulness of what you are doing. Of course there is much practical knowledge to be gathered from living from the land. But it seems more likely that care beyond the family and the band is a modern invention. I will look for it in the future, not in the past.

the possibility of doing a research project together with the biohacking community. It looks like we will try for it! The architecture of community involvement is as follows: \n\n1. [ReaGent](https://reagentlab.org/en/) is to be a full partner (with @JasperB in the lead). I also stole the lovely image above from their website. :-)\n\n2. Other labs in the community (@rachel, @ramykim, @dfko, @thomasmboa, @Dorsaf ...) to participate via fellowships that will be run by Reagent. This call is big on international (extra-EU and EEA) cooperation, so we need to make sure you non-European labs are fully paraded in the call. I do not yet know how: we will seek assistance from other partners.\n\n3. Other non-community partners include the [Lisbon Council](https://lisboncouncil.net/) (BE), [T6](http://www.t-6.it/) (IT) and [DESIS network](http://www.desisnetwork.org/) (IT). \n\nThe deadline is March 15th, and we are likely to need some help. For now, you can read the first version of the concept note [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l54mILoKcW6qgrLp0dbtN4gl_KXgm-F_3eyOdtKm388/edit#) (especially you, Jasper!). Since the EU has the tradition of giving vaguely Cold War-military acronyms to research projects, I called this one EPICS, for EPistemological Insights on Citizen Science.  :smile:", "created_at": "2019-01-28 21:34:57.093978", "updated_at": "2019-03-07 23:47:39.215354", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 237, "wiki": false, "reads": 20, "score": 114.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4034, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33884, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 6517, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2017-08-01 15:08:24.472365", "updated_at": "2017-08-01 15:08:24.472365", "deleted_at": "2017-08-01 15:09:23.156227", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24274, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2416, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Here's some feedback </b>\n\nThanks for the very clear and professional wrapup.\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Nadia is ok traveling to Egypt that week.</li>\n\n<li>I support the idea that [Noemi] would be the one going to the Black Sea.</li>\n\n<li>I see a potential drawback with using people close to UNDP as engagement managers: they would stay in their bubble.

Puis est venu vivre en France. Il a fallu que je prenne conscience de tous ces m\u00e9langes en moi, que je d\u00e9tecte les traces qu'ils avaient laiss\u00e9es malgr\u00e9 l'\u00e9rosion caus\u00e9 par l'adaptation \u00e0 la culture fran\u00e7aise.

Mais il a fallu surtout que j'en parle, fasse conna\u00eetre ce m\u00e9lange en moi et que j'affronte l'\u00e9tonnement ou le malaise de mes interlocuteurs. Le pls difficile est le malaise de ceux qui reconnaissent en moi la partie qui leur correspond, qu'elle soit italienne, espagnole, corse et m\u00eame alg\u00e9rienne.

Ils changent les explications qu'ils donnent \u00e0 propos du monde.\n\nCela ne marche pas tout le temps.

I dont know if you saw I did a TEDx presentation last saturday but it was on a relevant topic so you may find the content useful...I've posted the slides here: http://www.scribd.com/doc/102438722/TEDxULg-Presentation-by-Nadia-EL-Imam\n\nPersonally I have found that being forced to communicate my thoughts and ideas to an audience helps me to achieve clarity and focus. And also being forced to keep it short is great for filtering away anything but the most essential thing you want to achieve and can do with the resources at your disposal. So maybe putting something like that together would be a good idea.\n\nAlso rather than try to establish general rules I would suggest starting with identifying a number of people and who both would appreciate/ need concrete support from other community members, and would be willing to help others with their own projects. Try to prototype a good process and based a design on it, rather than the other way around.\n\nAs an example I recently did a workshop during an event in Berlin where I was asked to talk about Collaboration. Instead I just had the people in the session do a simple excercise:\n\nWe start with a simple round of introductions: your name and something you are obsessed or very interested in. As well as why you are in the room. \n\nNext we do a little exercise around trust: I ask people to split up into twos with one blindfolded and the other leading them to the one end of the room and back using only verbal instructions. We sit down and I ask people to describe their experience and we reflect on it a bit and talk about what this means. It's open ended but ties to collaboration and that is why we are there. When it feels like we are ready I ask people to do the following:\n\n1. Write down names of people you know you can turn to for help, people who would be the first you would ask. Take 2 minutes to do this.\n\n2. Now you are asked to next to each name write some things you thing they are good at. Do this for each name, you have 5 minutes to go through the list of names so you have to be fast.\n\nFinally we sit in a ring and everyone reads out what things they have written next to the names (without reading the names). People are asked if they would find any of those things useful and note down the connections to do a follow up email afterwards...\n\nPerhaps some version of this could be done online?", "created_at": "2012-08-10 14:38:55", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:59.923175", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 474, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 30.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 6, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 52271, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 9693, "post_number": 5, "raw": "I think tech determinism is unlikely to achieve what you want Matt.

In my limited experience, most EU doctoral programs are biased towards young, highly competitive candidates. Usually, more senior individuals access doctoral tracks by tertiary funding (e.g. the company hiring them covers the full university costs, and maintains them on payrol).\n\nCan you share with us how the idea of a PhD was selected, among other alternatives? Is it for the student status/visa? Or for the need to receive economic support? If their titles/certificates are at hand (which I presume, since they do not want to enrol in a bachelor, but in a doctorate), why not seeking a professional position (lecturer, lab technician, ...)? If they have tried and failed, could you share a bit more about this, to figure out what is the situation...\n\nIn general, no one size fits all in academic careers... It's my humble opinion, but for the double issue you are bringing to our attention,\u00a0I\u00a0am somewhat skeptical that anyone will be able to say \"get in touch with X\" or \"look up on Y\"... each solution will be custom tailored on the history and professional profile of the person.

Aujourd'hui, au Qu\u00e9bec, c'\u00e9tait le grand lancement, en grandes pompes - <em>Ta Ra Ta Ta</em> - du groupe Qu\u00e9bec ouvert et l'annonce du d\u00e9p\u00f4t du rapport Gautrin au premier ministre du Qu\u00e9bec. 60% des participants \u00e0 l'\u00e9v\u00e9nement GouvCamp \u00e9taient des employ\u00e9s du gouvernement. Hein? Quoi? J'ai sursaut\u00e9 sur ma chaise quand j'ai lu cela.

Cela rel\u00e8verait du simple 'bon sens'.\n\nJ'aurais attel\u00e9 pendant des semaines la vingtaine de gens du groupe Gautrin sur le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, les tweets et les courriels, pour rejoindre l'ensemble des participants \u00e0 la consultation publique, et m'assurer qu'un pourcentage de ces gens seraient pr\u00e9sents en personne \u00e0 l'\u00e9v\u00e9nement. Cela aurait exig\u00e9: 1) une mini-strat\u00e9gie de mobilisation; 2) des budgets pour inviter (payer le transport et s\u00e9jour) des gens. Peut-\u00eatre que cela a eu lieu, mais je n'ai rien vu de tel.

Nous pourrions prendre une photo de chaque projet gouvernemental dans chacun des pays, et l'analyser s\u00e9par\u00e9ment, puis rassembler le tout en un plus grand portrait, pour v\u00e9rifier l'\u00e9tendue de la pr\u00e9sence de la 'grande strat\u00e9gie'.

If you come in person, please arrive at 17.45. Let us know you are coming, so we can make arrangements. \n\n\n## Where (online)\n\nIf you are not in Brussels but you still want to participate, we will be welcoming you online at https://zoom.us/j/803380244 \n\n**Zoom requires download of the [the Zoom client](https://zoom.us/download#client_4meeting). Please allow a couple of minutes to download the app before joining.**\n\nTo save bandwidth, we will be streaming the meeting in audio only. Remote participants will have two ways to participate: via the chat in the Zoom app, and by speaking to the room. An MC in Brussels will be watching the chat. When you want to speak, say so in the chat and the MC will give you the floor. We appreciate it if you speak from a reasonably quiet room, wearing headphones and, ideally, a headset. \n\n\n## What we will talk about\n\nWe will discuss the economy in Annalee Newitz's _Autonomous_ ([review and synopsis](https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/23/16350130/autonomous-annalee-newitz-science-fiction-book-review)) and the kind of society it supports. We are especially interested in answering questions such as:\n\n* Why is intellectual property so central in the world of _Autonomous_?\n* What is the relationship between indenture and IPRs?\n* Labor markets are never discussed explicitly, but Newitz has made them part of her world building, and probably spent some time thinking about them. What can we say about labor markets, with a dual labor force (indentured and autonomous)? How do we imagine they work?\n* In the world of _Autonomous_, the Intellectual Property Coalition represses copyright piracy in blood. Yet, open culture seems to be tolerated. Is this realistic? Is it stable? Why?\n\n\n## Preparation\n\n* Ideally, read _Autonomous_! Over and above the economy of its world, it is an enjoyable, celebrated work of SF. \n* If you do not have the time for that, you can just skim the book and only read the flashback parts. They explain how and why Jack's biopirate operations were established. The why is particularly important, because a big part of it is the system of pharmaceutical patents and their economic and social consequences, as perceived by Jack, Krish and the rest of the Bilious Pills. You recognize the flashback parts because the sections of _Autonomous_ have dates: flashbacks start in 2115 and go over to the early 2120s. The novel's \"now\" is 2144.\n* If you do not have time even for that, read just the rest of this post. I try to supply some basic elements and quotations below.\n\n\n## Cheatsheet: discussing _Autonomous_ before reading it\n\n_Autonomous_ is mostly a meditation on freedom. The economy of its world, while more developed than you would find in most SF, is not a central consideration for Newitz. Additionally, what economics we can glimpse in the book is not fundamentally different from the advanced capitalist system we live in. In this sense, _Autonomous_ is very different from Doctorow's _Walkaway_.\n\nThere are two original, well developed differences between our economy and that of _Autonomous_: an overdeveloped, encroaching patent system, and indentured labor.\n\n\n### 1. Intellectual property rights \n\n_Autonomous_ runs on a capitalist knowledge economy. Pharmaceutical companies make money like they do in our world: they invent and market drugs. A lot of their business seems to be not so much in curing illnesses as in upgrading humans: life extension drugs, intelligence enhancing drugs, productivity drugs etc. The business model is based on patenting molecules and licensing out the right to manufacture them, like in our world. However, the system has degenerated. Copyright law is extremely severe; its enforcement is the responsibility of the International Property Coalition (IPC), which appears to be a treaty organization. IPC is allowed to maim and kill to repress patent violation, and it overrides national regulation:\n\n> Eliasz wasn\u2019t bound by the rules of this jurisdiction anymore. He answered to a higher authority: the IPC.\n\nAnother way in which the copyright system has degenerated is that companies want to increase the cost of compliance. \n\n> One of the CogSci guys asked why you couldn\u2019t just visit the patent office and get the drug\u2019s recipe directly from the publicly filed patents. She quoted from a recent article by a Freeculture legal scholar at Harvard, who had analyzed how much time and money it would take for an ordinary person to retain lawyers and experts who could actually navigate the expensive patent databases and figure out how a drug had been put together. Most drugs that made it out of trials were a confusing hodgepodge of licensed parts and processes, and it took corp money to figure out how it had been made. \n\nWith high costs on figuring out whether you are violating copyright and a risk of being killed of you do, most people take the path of least resistance and just pay extortionate prices to the pharma companies.\n\nEconomically, patents are legal monopolies. Economists normally dislike monopolies, because [they can be proven to be inefficient](https://econtutorials.com/blog/economic-inefficiencies-of-monopoly/). The argument for granting temporary monopolies over knowledge is that they put in place incentives to innovation and creation. However, there is a tendency for the regulation on copyright to be extended so that it allows rent extraction, i.e. economic activities that appropriate value rather than creating it. Three ways that this happens are: the extension of the duration of copyright protection (from 14 years to 70 years after the death of the original inventor or creator); \"upstream\" patenting (patenting building blocks of technology and creation, like the alphabet, or the wheel); patenting inventions resulting from publicly funded research. A recent critique of \"excess copyright\" in economics is found in Mariana Mazzucato's [The value of everything](https://marianamazzucato.com/publications/books/value-of-everything/). Clay Shirky [argues](http://www.ted.com/talks/defend_our_freedom_to_share_or_why_sopa_is_a_bad_idea.html) that copyright holders aim to \n\n> raise the cost of copyright compliance to the point where people simply get out of the business of offering it as a capability to amateurs.\n\nIn the world of _Autonomous_ excessive copyright protection affects access to advanced medical care. Since \"advanced medical care\" is mostly about upgrading humans, copyright laws end up driving large and persistent inequalities. \n\n> Krish compared the patent system to the indenture system, which Jack thought was kind of a stretch. But she had to admit that the patent system did seem to be at the root of a lot of social problems. Only people with money could benefit from new medicine. Therefore, only the haves could remain physically healthy, while the have-nots couldn\u2019t keep their minds sharp enough to work the good jobs, and didn\u2019t generally live beyond a hundred. Plus, the cycle was passed down unfairly through families. The people who couldn\u2019t afford patented meds were likely to have sickly, short-lived children who became indentured and never got out. Jack could see Krish\u2019s point about how a lot of basic problems could be fixed if only patent licensing were reformed.\n\nAlmost all the \"good guys\" in _Autonomous_ are copyright opposers; free culture/open knowledge activists like Krish, or downright pirates like Jack and Frankie. And yet, Newitz does not offer a reflection on free culture as an economic model, and is rather fascinated by their cultural expression (parties, body mods etc.). I have the impression that the cultural tropes of cyberpunk fiction demand that the hero is jaded, which prevents a reflection on motivational engines powering the economy. [We have seen](https://edgeryders.eu/t/the-economics-of-cory-doctorows-walkaway/8828/3?u=alberto) that this is, instead, very present in _Walkaway_, where \"human nature\" is intensely debated. \n\n> For a moment, Jack allowed herself to be charmed. These students loved their work at Free Lab so much that they came here when they weren\u2019t in class, first thing in the morning, just to find something \u201cintriguing\u201d to research. It had been a long time since she\u2019d worked on a drug project with people doing it for the thrill of discovery. Usually her lab teams were motivated by death or money, half-crazed with a desire to cure the former and bathe in giant tanks of the latter. She wasn\u2019t sure which motivation made better fuel for innovation: na\u00efve but ethical beliefs, or the need to survive.\n\n\n### 2. Indentured and non-indentured labor\n\nIndentured labor starts with the emergence of machine self-awareness and \"human-level intelligence\". When this happens, society decides that intelligent machines should be indentured to their creators, who can then sell their right over them. Paladin finds this out while visiting a museum dedicated to bot history.\n\n> Under IPC law, companies could offset the cost of building robots by retaining ownership for up to ten years. She scanned a legal summary that outlined how a series of court cases established human rights for artificial beings with human-level or greater intelligence. Once bots gained human rights, a wave of legislation swept through many governments and economic coalitions that later became known as the Human Rights Indenture Laws. They established the rights of indentured robots, and, after a decade of court battles, established the rights of humans to become indentured, too. After all, if human-equivalent beings could be indentured, why not humans themselves? In the Zone, however, there were no laws that allowed humans to be born indentured like bots.\n\nIndenture of intelligent robots is justified with an economic argument: it gives manufacturers the incentive to make them.\n\n> There were entire text repositories that focused on eliminating the indenture of humans. Their pundits argued that humans should not be owned like bots because nobody paid to make them. Bots, who cost money, required a period of indenture to make their manufacture worthwhile. No such incentive was required for humans to make other humans.\n\nIn _Autonomous_, bots are created as valuable resources. They are law enforcers (Paladin, Fang), researchers (Med, Actin), culture workers (Bug), and of course sex workers. There is not much talk of automation taking working class jobs. Working class jobs, it seems, are worked by indentured humans. This shows in the experience of Threezed:\n\n> \u201cI got slaved when I was five. My mom sold me to one of those indenture schools. They taught me to read and make an engine.\u201d His attention wandered back to Metropolis, whose evil bot was frozen in the middle of a passionate speech about worker uprisings. \nOutside, pale blue lakes flashed between dark pines. There were no cars on the road and it was almost evening. \n\u201cSo how did you end up with that fusehead?\u201d \nThreezed was clearly feigning disinterest now, idly advancing the movie frame by frame. The bot clutched her breasts with agonizing slowness, eyes wide. \n\u201cThe school went broke and auctioned off our contracts.\u201d \nJack had read about tough cases where indentured had their contracts bought out from under them, their terms changed overnight. But she was still surprised to hear that one of the AU indenture schools, even a bankrupt one, had sold its wards without any background checks. \n\u201cThey sold your contract to that guy?\u201d \nThreezed shrugged and poked the bot\u2019s action forward on the monitor. \u201cNo, they sold me to this machining lab, and then the lab decided to cut corners, so they auctioned me out in Vegas.\u201d", "created_at": "2018-09-20 09:19:58.703235", "updated_at": "2019-03-08 01:04:35.522502", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1957, "wiki": false, "reads": 25, "score": 405.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3904, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 44547, "user_id": 3904, "topic_id": 8585, "post_number": 1, "raw": "As I walked in I was offered a desk and made to feel at home. I was at DARE space - the co-working, workshop and event space of [MCISE](http://www.mcise.org/en/) - and having run late for my meeting with @adnane, I got a chance to do some work of my own as he finished off other meetings so we could finally meet! It was an apt intro to MCISE and its work - the **Moroccan Centre for Innovation and Social Entrepreneurship** - where access is open, people are welcomed and ideas flow. \n\nSo there I was in the midst of my work amongst the bustle of DARE, and Hind the young women who heads up MCISE's communications and I got into a dialogue about what we were each doing. A natural opening and I was being introduced to the MCISE's vast array of work. Follow that up with a solid and passionate meeting with @adnane (Adnane Addioui, MCISE's co-founder and president), and there's some exciting prospects for collaboration that are emerging. As a starting frame, the social innovations and entreprises emerging from MCISE span **agriculture (30-40%), access to energy/ energy consumption, access to education/ teaching methodologies, access and quality of health including training, food business/ inclusive farming and production.**  \n\nI'm going to summarise what I got on their relevant programs, and highlight where I see potential opportunity in terms of partnership and alliance.\n\n## **DARE space**:\n\nan accessible co-working, workshop and event space open to anyone and host of a wide variety of events spanning innovation, science, art and more. \n_Here I see an **opportunity for sharing events and live-streaming** to expand the reach of Edgeryders' knowledge sharing and MCISE community's access. For example, hosting an event at DARE space in real-time with an [Edgeryders' Academy](http://academy.edgeryders.eu/) webinar (as discussed with @nadia @matteo_uguzzoni @hugi and @owen in our last call).\n\n## **[DARE inc](http://dareinc.mcise.org/en/program/)**:\n\nthe flagship program of MCISE from what I understand, it's \"a three-track program [over 4months] that aims to support social entrepreneurs from the moment they decide to tackle a social issue until they incite systemic change by means of a viable startup. The program is designed to respond to the specific needs of each startup at each stage of their development.\" They've supported 150 start-ups with [27 funded to prototype](http://dareinc.mcise.org/en/startups/)/ \"accelerate.\" \n\n_Here I see two specific and connected opportunities at this stage: _\n_1. expanding DARE Inc (and MCISE's other activities) to the **Edgeryders platform** to sustain the network after first contact, continue the conversations, support P2P knowledge sharing and offer access to the global experience and expertise of Edgeryders' network._\n_2. foster a pathway through Dare Inc into the **OpenVillage dense network** towards autonomous co-living/ co-working spaces for these program's \"graduates\" to establish themselves autonomously, yet supported by the network's knowledge and resource sharing. Note here MCISE's strong partnership network._ \n\n## **[Wuluj](https://www.wuluj.com/) / the Alliance**:\n\nThis is a crowdfunding platform developed in partnership with [happysmala](http://www.happysmala.com/). \n_Here I see an opportunity to explore the Alliance in its true vision, as we are also in conversations with happysmala as per [this post](https://edgeryders.eu/t/openvillage-and-happysmala-crowdsourcing-crowdsolving-skills-development-new-organisational-forms-research-coliving/8500). Whether it's specifically about Wuluj or another project, there is a powerful **opportunity to expand potential collaboration beyond B2B partnership into a constellation of allied SMEs/ not-for-profits to leverage our programs to scale and impact.** Ping @ericasmar, perhaps worthwhile having a group call with @adnane about this in the near future. I'll do a separate post shortly around the the medium-term vision of the Alliance and ping you, but let me know what you think about a call to discuss collaboration across._\n\n## [Tamkeen](http://www.mcise.org/tamkeen-2/):\n\nNot directly relevant right now I wanted to mention Tamkeen because of how it shows MCISE's experience in scaling and impact. Tamkeen is an awareness initiative targeted at high school students to promote and build capacities in social innovation and social entrepreneurship. It's reached 500 students across 36 districts so far, and includes a regional competition followed by the national level.\n\n## [Enactus Morocco](https://www.enactus-morocco.org/):\n@adnane also heads up Enactus Morocco (and happens to be an [Ashoka Fellow](https://www.ashoka.org/en/program/ashoka-venture-and-fellowship)) :tophat: Enactus Morocco program is focused on mobilising networks of university students in social innovation projects, prizes and pilots on the ground. Interested in reinventing public education it reaches 10,000/year. \n_As with DARE Inc I see opportunity here in outreach for the OpenVillage and offering these students access to the Edgeryders' and OpenVillage networks._\n\n## Next steps\n\n@adnane and I were clear that the alignment is strong and partnership worthwhile. We came up with an initial idea as to how to move forward and I think it's a great second case after FRIDA for evolving the Alliance partnership framework.\n \n* **Clear on offer and needs**\nLet's start by getting clear on what we can offer and what we need. For example, @adnane was very clear that he sees a lack in MCISE that could be met by Edgeryders through our **expertise network, scaling opportunities, access to global markets and resources**. And it's clear to me that MCISE's processes for onboarding and guiding young people in the local Moroccan context, as well as their dynamic network of young social innovators, social entrepreneurs, community and international partners meets our needs in scaling. \n\n* **Mapping the landscape** \nGetting clear on where our programs are going, partnerships are forming, and importantly for MCISE, what kind of experts can their community have access to. \n\n* **Three concrete areas to collaborate around**\nAs with any collaboration, let's be concrete. I've highlighted above opportunities I see. Curious as to what @nadia and you @adnane think of those places to start with.  Immediate concrete opportunity is a webinar live streamed to DARE space towards the end of May/ early June. \n\nThis is a seed for a longer conversation and activities! I do think another call will be useful soon, and collating a document with our specific needs/ offers. For now, I'd love to hear the collective's thoughts and let's see what takes hold here.

The space is ready for you to arrive. \n\nWe can figure out together the optimum use of the space according to the group needs.\n\n@hadeerghareeb  started the [first aid wiki](https://edgeryders.eu/t/our-pharmacy/8015/4) so we can fill our pharmacy with the needed stuff.\n\nThere are some unfinished buildings around Sidi Kaouki, there are at least 3 near our house, and some others near the center. we still have no idea about the owners and why is these buidlings uninhabited and unfinished. This info might be useful for a potential openvillage academy in sidi kaouki for a longer term. \n\n**2. Securing some tools.**\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/30302ef8b7f4d07f1c70c5d89c3433378a7bb524.jpg\" width=\"517\" height=\"690\"> \n<small> photo of our tools wardrobe </small>\n\n* There is a trash market ( used parts flea market ) every Sunday in Essaouira. It is a nice place to find spare parts, tools, cooking utensils, some electronics ....etc, it ends at a regular trash market where there is even and [art corner inside](https://edgeryders.eu/t/your-toys-out-of-trash-arabic-english/6687/15?u=hazem).\n\n* Getting tools is still an ongoing process as there are some tools that we will need and don't have yet. Also preparing a nice workshop space to be done near the local technique room.\n\n* we got in touch with someone in Essaouira who has a **120*120 cm CNC** machine that we can rent and use.\n\n**3. Mapping Essaouira - Sidi Kaouki**\n\nCheck out our points of interests [map](http://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/essaouira-pois_193062#13/31.3407/-9.7587), There you can find our mapping for Essaouira, Sidi kaouki and the nearby places. ( you can find instructions how to use it and add your own points in the house manual )\n\n**4. Local community meetings**\n\n* We meet up with a [local initiative](https://edgeryders.eu/t/sidi-kaouki-local-initiative-meeting-documentation/7997) in Sidi Kaouki and touched upon our potential collaboration; specially regarding the trash problem and the school.\n\n* we had an informal meeting with some young folks starting their own restaurant cafe in the Center, They are happy to get involved in our activities, and join the different workshops, movie screenings...etc.\n\n* A quick visit to the school to see the status quo, quite a small \"school\" just 2 rooms with a small empty area as a playground. A charitable organization from Casablanca should have connected Electricity and fixed the bathroom this week. \nThe schol has 63 children [ 27 girls, 36 boys] and 3 teachers ( didn't meet them yet ). Only Classes from 1 to 6 and class 7 and up in Smimou, Tidzi, Ghazuoa or Essaouira, \nThe visit was rewarding as we found our nearest ( not too salty ) water well near the school :D\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/69a5990b7160602037b642c6ee73594aa38c592e.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"517\"> <small> The school </small>\n\n\n## 4. Way ahead\n\n@alberto already arrived and made us some delicious italian food. February is the time where most project teams arrive and we get into action. \n\nIn the first 10 days we have already the local radio workshop planned and the initiation of the coffee sorter and BitCut project.", "created_at": "2018-02-01 20:02:29.421547", "updated_at": "2019-03-08 15:15:27.588377", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1025, "wiki": false, "reads": 27, "score": 465.4, "like_count": 7, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 3811, 5, 4257, 8, 3703, 4265], "is_private": false}, {"id": 50341, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 9421, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Noted, thanks for the explanations and keep up the good work!", "created_at": "2019-01-25 12:51:35.009221", "updated_at": "2019-01-25 12:51:35.009221", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 11, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 38.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [50321], "is_liked_by": [4736], "is_private": false}, {"id": 58975, "user_id": 4163, "topic_id": 10552, "post_number": 10, "raw": "Hi Alberto, \n\nFirst of all, I'd gladly add my tips to the wiki myself asap :). Secondly, I see you have quite some travelling to do. If it would be possible for your to stay in Berlin (or Copenhagen) for a couple of days, you could consider travelling by train from Berlin to Copenhagen, and travel to Helsinki by train and ferry from there. It will still be a long journey, 25 hours, but you can generally book private space/a bedroom on a ferry. This would allow you to get some work done on the way. Speaking from personal experience, these ferries are generally pretty comfortable and feature (tax-free) shops and restauration as well. Again, the Interrail global pass covers ferries as well! #bonus!\n\nIf you want to spend more time in Copenhagen afterwards, you could take the plane to Copenhagen from Helsinki, and then take the train back from Copenhagen to Brussels. If that's not the case, you can fly straight from Helsinki to Copenhagen. Both scenario's would reduce your number of (long-distance) flights from 2 to 1. \n\nThe last scenario would look like this: \n\nBrussels-Cologne-Berlin, total 7h \n\nBerlin-Hamburg-Fredericia-Copenhagen, total 7,5h\n\nCopenhagen-Stockholm Central-Stockholm Tegelvikshammen(ferry)-Helsinki Katajanokka-Helsinki; total 25h\n\nHelsinki-Brussels (by plane)\n\nWhat do you think?

It's called a twitterstorm, it's happening on Saturday (16/9) and we need your help to make it happen. Please do the following\n\n1. [Add 3 or more tweets on to this list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aEEAfWxnghveX8c1mocrPDW1Qfw3KnRUMvZpEcHlSjE/edit#gid=1049567654) right now!\n\n2. Make sure that you are online at 10:30 am CET!\nFollow @edgeryders with #openvillage\n <br />\n\n\n## Whaaaaat is this?!?\n\nOn Saturday we announce the OpenVillage to the world in style. Through a Twitterstorm!  \n\nFor those of you who are unfamiliar with this format it's like **a massive press conference where everyone is talking to everyone on twitter**. Think of it as a flashmob on the internet\n\n**The audience participates by opening two twitter windows.** One in which they are following the @edgeryders account. In the second one they do a search for the #openvillage hashtag and watch the search results. <br />\n\n**People who follow the @edgeryders twitter account get the *big* story about what is happening** for those who have never heard about it - told in one 140 character sentence at a time. <br />\n\n**People who follow the #openvillage hashtag search results get a large amount of tweets from many different accounts talking about the same thing.** They get a big diversity of tweets from twitter accounts because different members of the community are telling their own version of the story focusing on what is especially relevant or interesting about the OpenVillage project and festival for them and their audience.\n\n\n## Why should You Participate?\n\n**Good for you:** You can feature your own project as part of a massive conversation where many people are paying attention. Because you can quickly meet others in the community and get an overview of what is happening. Because together we draw a lot of attention to the bigger story and collective effort to make social impact - you can show how your own work is an important part of big movement and that it should be supported!\n\n**Good for everyone:** This action is a good way to show people who are struggling to make the world a better place that they are not alone. That there are many ways in which peers are working on the same challenges, and many ways to support one anothers' efforts.\n\n\n## How to join the Twitterstorm\n\n1. **Right Now:** Go to the spreadsheet where we are preparing the materials and make your own contribution in the form of [3 or more tweets here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aEEAfWxnghveX8c1mocrPDW1Qfw3KnRUMvZpEcHlSjE/edit#gid=1049567654).\n\n2. **On Saturday at 10:30 - 11:30 CET make sure you are logged into Twitter and open 2 tabs**. One where you have search results for the #openvillage hashtag. Another where you can post your status updates. At 11:00 CET , start posting your tweets and reply to comments or questions that pop up int the #openvillage search results.\n\n\n## Want to do more to help?\n\n Yayy! Help spread the word about the twitterstorm. Invite friends to join us by sharing this update and flyer on twitter:\n\n> _See you Saturday?! Everything you need to know about the people and projects joining #OpenVillage. We lay out our grand vision for the festival and what comes next in a 30 minute mini-conference on Twitter.

Last year's part B was 60 pages long; and sections that have a similar role in the table of content were of very different lengths. For example, section 1.2.2 (description of the work carried out in WP2) was 6 pages long, while section 1.2.3 (description of the work carried out in WP3) was 16 pages long. In this section, I recommend omitting discussing results (covered by Part A) and certainly not listing the events we participated in (also covered by part A). Refer, do not repeat: repetition will only annoy the reviewer. \n1. Impact section by partner. I wrote a short project-wide \"Impact on science\" \u2013 that we share, as a project. But the \"Impact on business\" will differ across partners. So I only wrote Edgeryders's, and I invite you do to the same for your organisation.\n1.

He was about to expand the space, invest in a complete kitchen and production space. **What happened in March was that 95% of the business went down because it was event based. Did not have the cash flow to keep running costs (rent), so looked a bit at what he really wanted to do with fermentation.** Could do short circuit production, work with the biomarket next door and also found a local farm where Yannick can put a workshop inside the farm. Major concerns now are the broader logistics (certification, how to bring it to customers and to shops). \u2018I see a lot of small projects that don\u2019t want to become a reseller on a big level, struggling at that point.\u2019\n\nWith covid, I saw lots of small producers coming together and creating networks that worked well in that urgency, but now with coming back to normal you don\u2019t see where it\u2019s going. There is a willingness, but it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s economically good.\n\n> The flow I see, maybe in oct-nov the events and classical restaurants may go back to a normal pace. We know that we can reopen the restaurants, but only 4 people at a table and on a capacity between 30-50% of what we are normally doing. I\u2019m skeptic that once business goes back to usual, everyone goes back to their own little place and their own fires to put out. **For small food producers, there is a lot the problem of scalability if you want to be fair, to have good products, good transport.** - Yannick\n\n@Puja: Hasn\u2019t this issue of logistics been there all the time, before covid19?\nYannick: This has been enhanced when everyone is trying to use logistics and delivery options. You saw that they were making barbecue packs, or setting together a shop to sell, and it created a faster start to work together. Everyone was talking about it, but no one had the time. Now you had to create those possibilities.\n\nJohn: In the UK, we\u2019ve seen a combination of small producers setting up a route to the market - ie a digital portal that they would sell through -  and another network called \u201cIn my backyard\u201d, where on a local level they can parcel together. In that way they can also be represented online. In New York, people who have premises, who might have been doing one thing, are now becoming an outlet for small producers i.e. a bookstore which is now part bookstore, part a hub to sell directly.\n\n**This uncertainty: what happens next? How much distancing will we continue to have, therefore how would your restaurant be able to continue? I\u2019ve seen an emergency reaction - a restaurant who will go to delivery, but that\u2019s employing one chef and maybe his son. The uncertainty is what\u2019s bugging most people at the moment.**\n\nI\u2019m interested in how community can be a resource. Slow food people around the world: the first reaction was we need to look at our community, the closest to us, that\u2019s proved to be the salvation.\n\n# **The challenge is now going forward. If everything reverts to normal, how do we not lose that intimate connection that was made in a community?**\n\nJohn: We are at a moment when doors have been opened to people who did not use community before. How do we keep them from returning to the grocery stores?\n\nYannick: Our shop is turning into a group buyers place. I want to continue to support the producers with whom I work all the time. I asked them: \u2018Would you be interested to work 2 hrs a month and buy from fermenting producers?\u2019 I found 25-30 people who want to spend 2 hours that want to be part of that model.\n\nWhere it blocks is in the administrative and legal.\nIf you lose the entity of the company to create a cooperative this poses legal problems. \n\n# **How to invest a community while being able to follow all the rules, especially in food?**\n\n@angelo: in Italy, what I\u2019ve seen that surprised me in rural areas is that the old shops in neighborhoods got a revival. In crisis, the people were discovering again the sense of community. I was surprised, I was convinced that the hypermarket was the future.\nI think that we\u2019ll never get back to the way we were. I\u2019ve seen it in wines for instance. The restaurants remain the main point of sales for them. They started some strange wine tasting events on zoom, but the online selling of wines for them was not known. Most of them simply didn\u2019t give value to it. So maybe you can find some new people who are interested in doing this.\n \nJohn: That question of how many would stay that way - I think people have been reminded very brutally that hunger is not far away. It\u2019s hard because in a way you are in a good place, but practically it is a struggle. 6 months ago, people were less open to that sense of community. It\u2019s valuing what\u2019s around you - in your street, village or wherever. We run a hashtag that Eating local is the new normal. I think people want to believe that local is the new normal and some think  that we can come out of this better.\n\n@Nadia: We have a community member who\u2019s a developer but wanted to be in cow-herding. Marco was working on an app and was interested in these small mom&pop shops. They were missing out on a lot of consignments. There has been an explosion of initiatives that work on one or other part of these problems. **First, there\u2019s a community wrt neighborhood** (which may or may not connect), people who have a relationship with each other culturally or along languages. **Then there\u2019s people in one part of the food sector at the fringes (niche).** It\u2019s all of these smaller factions - dealing with  logistics on how people move across the city. **Then there\u2019s infrastructure - Digital, and Buildings & transport**\n\n**The issue that\u2019s closest to hand is maybe transport and delivery. We have a model (food delivery apps) and UPS (logistics companies). There are open source softwares that could be used by people in food sectors.** Right now, I think Uber is taking a 30% cut on their revenue. In Brussels, there\u2019s already taxi drivers that developed their own alternative to Uber. When you call the hotline, the people on the call decide which people would drive which routes. So they set up their own app called the Victor app. The difference is that you can pay cash or by card. It solved a problem for the taxi driver - knowing in advance what they\u2019ll be paid.\n\nJohn: My take would be to speak to similar networks that share your value, Yannick, and see what they can. They might be very well connected and may know others who are swimming in the same sea and can make an ecosystem.\n\n# Geographic scale is key.\n\nYannick: I want to get back to what Angelo said. I think it\u2019s the locality at the geographical level is really important. In Schaarbeek, the restaurants, the producers, they all played along. It resonated with people living there - who thought \u2018I can support my local space\u2019.  \n\n* The moroccan and the Indian scene is interesting. They have their own solutions. Example, dabbahwallas (lunch-box delivery systems in Indian cities). Grey economy alliances, peers in moroccan, Indian mom and pop shops. I like to say that Edgeryders should be like a Bangladeshi supermarket family\n\n* Cycle coop is already up and running. They are happy to help, we would need to fundraise a bit to cover their coding time because it\u2019s income they need to keep the software going and well maintained\n\n* The Cabas initiative - a cooperative that was built in Brussels that wants to make a basic payroll for food producers. It\u2019s between being an office structure and independent.\n\nNoemi: There\u2019s an issue with scale and logistics for small producers.\n\nCaroline is the owner of Hummus x hortense (best plant based restaurant in Brussels): \n> We created a veg box service to help a farm that only sold to restaurants - 5 restaurants. He could have broken even at 50 boxes, but we sold 200-250 boxes every week.\nOur restaurant is very much about storytelling - to tell them stories about the farms and the people around it. To nurture them, not just to feed our customers. If we look at the behaviour of our guests, there was only a minority who expressed eco-consciousness in their daily behaviour. There was the biggest group that were moderately conscious and I think that group has become more conscious in their food choices. I think that group is quite critical. Of course, there is a minority of people who are not moving anywhere.\n\nJohn: Is there anything we could do to keep and nourish them? Other than continuing, do you think there is anything we can do?\n\nCaroline: We have different levels - individual, social, political, societal. We have to tackle it at all different levels. I\u2019ve noticed it\u2019s helpful if you can connect all these little dots. Now there are so many people involved and creating networks and communities is so powerful. There are pioneers and there are followers. We are the pioneers but we need followers to push the wave forward.\n\nJohn: One of the suggestions we were looking at was even practical advice on how to live more ecologically would be helpful. \n\nNadia: How much of this comes down to technology? We\u2019ve seen in edgeryders that there are people who are working in different communities and come together in a free flow network. What kind of challenges are practical and can be solved by use of technology or better logistics? What are the main obstacles for things scaling up?\n\nCaroline: If I think of tech, I think of SoMe. Are you talking about tech concerning farmers or in SoMe?\n\nNadia: Technology in supply chains and flow of information. We have a lot of technologists in our community. We have case studies that are very community driven and were looking at what are threats to their community. We saw that these were coordination costs - the missing glue. \n\nCaroline: I think data-collection is as we see with our farmers. They have a range of flowers and vegetables. After the first few years, he updates what is available and what has to go. If he has an overload of certain veg, we buy them and make cocktails and dishes with them. That helps us reduce food waste as well as supporting a farm.\nHe had a lot of shiso, so we bought it and made pralines with that. \n\nYannick: I think there\u2019s a part of it that could be coordinated. It\u2019s a question of scale. I like to do everything myself, but sometimes it takes a lot of time. In my case, it\u2019s not interesting enough for them because I\u2019m the only supplier in that space. \nSome basic needs could be supplied by technology. If there\u2019s a website that I\u2019ve built myself, there could be a follow-up and help update it regularly.\n\nNadia: I have a questions regarding capacity for restaurants. How much of a difference would it make to use outside spaces? Would it help the regulations about lowering capacity?\n\nCaroline: Normally, we have 32 seats now reduced to 22 seats. In Belgium, the weather is unpredictable. In our case, we can handle 22 seats. If we need to employ more staff, then it would be a case of our values.\n\nPuja: https://www.tasteofhome.com/article/amsterdam-restaurant-greenhouse-dining/ \n\nNadia to Caroline: Could some of the clients volunteer to help?\nCaroline: It\u2019s really interesting to work in our kitchen. We offer that opportunity. Have 3 interns this summer staying for 1-3 months. There are international interns coming and we work with people who come for one day and get the feel of the restaurant. We tried to organize different events. We\u2019ll organize a 3 day event at the field, with dinner in the fields. We\u2019ll also organize one day with young chefs to inform them of this new way of running a farm, with the Culinary Institute Ter Duinen, Koksijde. Hopefully, they\u2019ll also work with local farmers. We also work with a renowned culinary institute with chefs in training.

It was an opportunity to reconnect with the people within the network, as well as make new friends.\n\n![|387x690](https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b4198baf2998ab87e36550b5c0245a7191164c9c.jpg)\n\n[Arrival by night: a poem inspired by the journey to the retreat ](https://medium.com/@theworldsetfree/arrival-by-night-1a1eb8496a2e)\n\nOur discussions on the roadtrip to the venue were wide ranging. We covered the work of Carl Jung; the alchemy of communities; theoretical physics; and the practical applications of magic in the hands of the storyteller! All normal discussions to have in a car full of Edgeryders.\n\nThese topics provided me with a context for the following days. All my discussions and conversations then became viewed through these strange lenses. After a few months in the wilderness it became clear to me how much i value and rely on the Edgeryders community.\n\nThe next steps on the Edgeryders journey seem so exciting and challenging. So much of our current journey is looking at how we live together better - with discussions happening around the OpenVillage format; developing physical spaces that we can live and work together and improve the quality of life for both ourselves, and the communities in which we live. While this inevitably involves thinking about the technological solutions, the ways we communicate internally and externally, and the future of the work/life relationship, there are other factors at play as well. As a writer and cultural manager, i\u2019m most interested in the ways in which we express ourselves artistically in these new environments. Where is the space for artistic expression (both within our own lives and in our external relationships with the wider world) within this framework? With increase time and scope for self-actualisation and better work/life balances, where is the gap for play? And what might that look like across Edgeryders spaces and places?\n\nI see a lot of creative and cultural practitioners in the community, working in diverse areas; for institutions and for communities; artists; writers; cultural organisers; journalists; videographers; etc. The whole spectrum of artistic and cultural practice wither exists on the site, or has passed through our community either online or at live events.\n\n***I\u2019m frequently asking myself: \u201cwhat brings us together, here\u201d and \u201cwhat can hold us together, here\u201d.***\n\nThere\u2019s evidently something within the discussions, practices and research on this platform that attracts those working within these intersections. So how do we find ways of tapping into that creative energy and provide opportunity to people from those backgrounds to explore their practice through the Edgeryders framework?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a series of big questions. Not all which we\u2019re close to answering yet, but there\u2019s a good core of people for whom these questions keep coming up, and i want to try to utilise that connection and the energy that comes from it to craft something magical. Something special. Something unique, that can only come together out of the alchemy of this community.\n\n**So what does that mean on a practical level?**\n\nWe are  **looking for interesting partners and funders**  who are aligned not only with Edgeryders current goals and principles, but also those whose partnership and integration may help us to grow in the directions we are most drawn to. We look to people whose interests align to help shepherd that process.\n\nSecondly, we are undertaking a comprehensive  **mapping exercise to reexamine the conversations and people in Edgeryders over the years,**  re-ignite interests and reconnect with people whose journeys with us may have been brief, and to see if this new strand of idea fits with their current practices. This is well underway, but any input into this is welcome, to ensure that we don\u2019t miss out on the edges of our own Edge. Fortunately we have the option of using EdgeSense and GraphRyder to help us do some of the work! Score one for the data scientists!\n\nThirdly, we are looking at building a  **research project to look into how digital arts and artists can intersect with modern communal living.**  Edgeryders exists so firmly within the digital sphere but as we look to create more permanent real world spaces how can these two worlds come together. What might that look like? How do we marry the world of funded digital art with the ideas of \u2018outsider\u2019 and community arts practices? This idea is still in the creative and shaping stage, so we\u2019re looking for input from anyone who feels like this idea has particular resonance to their own practices (whether artist, or living)\n\nFinally, we continue to think about how the Edgeryders live event formats that we have run and loved fit into this project. There seems to be an overlap where those of us with cultural backgrounds are drawn also to the  **event production and the live spaces.**\n\nWe see that there is a need to continue to provide the chance for people already within the community together face-to-face in ways that both support and challenge. We have ambitions to see these events grow and to remain a core part of the ER development process over the next few years. Without the obvious tenpole of projects such as OpenCare, we need to find new ideas that can act as the strong attractors for the community. There are already ideas in the pipeline, but more are always needed.\n\n**Example ideas: A Making-of-community-art kind of camp**\n\nNoemi and I are both interested in collaboratively constructed events that produce real world artefacts, as well as live experiences. We\u2019re inspired by events like poc21.cc (among others), but with an interest in how these events can be used to solve structural social problems, or to investigate community cohesion through artistic and cultural expression. Encouraging participants to attend with their own ideas or practices and to expand them into finished artifacts whilst on site. Edgeryders interests and skills at capturing the processes could help create some interesting data as well as the finished work. Meanwhile, we all get to live and work alongside each other as people. Perhaps the camp expands after the final day to become something for the wider public? Inspired by the festival ethos of places like Borderland and Burning Man.\n\nIt\u2019s a continuation of the LOTE idea, and the OpenVillage Festival design process. But, with opportunities for growth and development of cultural practitioners through creative means.\n\nSimilarly, we are in discussions looking at the next steps for the EconSciFi group. We are exploring how this reading and discussion group grows into a live event, with iterations over the next 12 months. With these events there is another chance to reach out to new interesting groups; participants; partners; and wider audiences. More ways to bring a small slice of the Edgeryders way towards the centre.\n\nI know there are many other ideas like this bubbling under the surface\n\n**So how can you help? We have the 3 core next steps that you can respond to**\n\nWho could be good sources of funding to help support the development of the research project, and/or the live event ideas? Who should we be talking to that may be perfect partners for delivering either of these ideas?\n\nHow could we create a self sustaining research topic that can interest and engage as many people already within the ER network as possible, whilst also providing useful outputs to help us on our journey?\n\nWhat do you see as being the next step for Edgeryders events?

And where does it come from?_\n_What does spirituality mean in the 21st century?_\n\n**_\"One can&rsquo;t live by bread alone.\"_**\n\nAs the economic and political landscape of the previous generation continues to change, people experience growing uncertainty and feel threatened. It seems that the resulting anxiety is not necessarily connected to material insecurity of a person, as many of those whose livelihoods have improved experience some sort of\u2026 emptiness and unrest. It shows, that bread alone is not enough.\n\n**Is it possible that the moral and spiritual values with which we raise our children to prepare them for their future lives are different, compared to the past many of us grew up in?**\n\nEnvironmental disasters, global pandemics, the use of weapons gravely contaminating specific war-torn areas, terrorist attacks, the ever-present threat of war with apocalyptic consequences, the pushing of the borders of human experience and existence in the medical, social and psychological senses \u2026 are just some of the contours of the new reality, a long-term social crisis, of which we, too, are protagonists. This particularly holds true for geographic localities such as the Western Balkans region, whose residents have personally experienced the evil nature of the new global social reality. Faith in a future that will bring us satisfaction, better health and education, safety and relief has been substituted by fears and doubts of whether life will even be possible in the future that awaits us.\n\nWe&rsquo;d like to think together about what can be done to provide people around us with emotional and psychological support that would allow them to be better prepared for the challenges of our time. What are the elements of our past(s) that can help us to maintain our spiritual and moral wellbeing as individuals and as communities, and which ones are no longer useful to us?\n\nFor example In Poland, the Catholic church provides the majority of people with such support - 90% of Poles declare their belonging to the Catholic church, most of them attend weekly mass and pray at home. At the same time, the growing numbers of young people turn away from the Church and religious practices. As the PEW Research Center shows the gap between the religiosity of older and younger generations is growing. Can we conclude from this that people are simply turning away from spirituality? It is not so simple. For example while the Czech Republic is one of the most secular countries in the region according to the Czech Statistical Office, the values of culture and symbolic representations of wellbeing are associated with a high degree of spirituality.\n\nThese changes are a result of a modern lifestyle - moving to big cities, having access to higher education, better health care. The better we live, the less we&rsquo;re interested in God, it seems - and that is the case with most of the developed and developing countries. Secularisation around the world usually goes hand in hand with the improvement of economic conditions.\n\n**And yet, isn&rsquo;t there something missing in this picture?**\n\nMaterial success alone does not provide us with happiness and a sense of fulfillment. Each generation seems to follow a moral direction, without which it would be difficult for it to achieve peace of mind, and, well, yes, spiritual fulfillment. Regardless of whether we participate in weekly masses or decide to take a break from the Church, we continue to ground our lives in some values and try to follow role models who shape our decisions and actions. They tell us how to relate to our neighbors and relatives, how to treat the nature that surrounds us and how to raise our children.\n\nIf we look below the surface, we are seeing the rise of out of church movements and new spiritual and cultural outlets such as women&rsquo;s gospel choirs (The Generation Center in Liberec) or even yoga! In Poland some people are responding by expressing an overwhelming support for parents occupying the Parliament in an attempt to improve the lives of their disabled children. In Greece people are practicing values of solidarity to deal with the breakdown of the healthcare system; from Serbia we hear the plea for equality and empathy with LGBT minorities.\n\nAs the economic and political landscape of the previous generations continues to change, we notice a feeling of instability and anxiety experienced by many citizens in different parts of Europe and beyond. **Perhaps there is a need for reflecting on what we need to cope and be psychologically and emotionally healthy in this new time.**\n\nWe want to learn how your culture is similar or different to how people in other parts of the world in this respect. As well as what can we learn from each other. How do your personal belief conform to or disagree with beliefs of people you know? Do you consider yourself the norm or an exception in your country? And how are you contributing to common values and a contemporary &quot;national culture&quot; ?\n\nThese questions are significant in light of our search for understanding well-being from a variety of perspectives, including living well together in our countries and with other Europeans.\n\n# We have created a special forum for this need, where we can safely talk about important topics. \nWe will avoid conflicts and insults here, we will provide all participants with the right conditions to express their own experiences, opinions and feelings. Without judgement or imposing our ideas on one another.\n\nThanks to you, we will understand what are the life experiences of anyone who has something to say about it.\n\nThose who are especially active in the conversation are eligible to get a 200 \u20ac reward for their contributions if they are based in Europe.

Part of this involved bringing together Scifi authors/filmmakers etc and Economists - [More on this here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/science-fiction-economics/13927).\n\nThere had been some work going on under the radar for some time but it officially kicked off last year when Cory Doctorow (Scifi author) and Kirsten Dunlop (  CEO of EIT Climate-KIC)  joined Alberto at the first Science Fiction Economics Lab. \n\nI was marginally involved at the time, only stepping in to help the crew with the crowdfunding. Cory did a stellar talk and I learned a alot about the realities of rewiring different actors in the contemporary economy from Kirsten. \n\nAlberto approached me about taking over development of the lab after the first edition. Part of this involves developing the format of the events so they are part of a co-creation journey. Another is to figure out how to do this in a setting where people can speak their own languages and involve their own local communities in a transnational conversation. Plus all this needs to happen online.\n\nWe decided to do a variant of our OCI Lab (a peer to peer incubator for developing business ventures) - but geared towards policy. We had already prototyped the basic process with the World Bank last year with promising results. Basically it's a series of webinars around specific cases where people have done really inspiring work on rewiring local economies. Figure out some follow up tasks and then architecting some kind of environment that supports people to put what is learned into practice. With some follow up etc. \n\nIt's not the easiest task - the European Union alone has 24 official languages and heavens knows how many regions (depending on how you use the terminology). But it's well worth the effort when you get to discover and learn from the remarkable work of people like Gaetano and the rest of the collective in Messina. \n\nAlberto did a nice writeup about it some time ago, i recommend you read it before showing up at the event: https://edgeryders.eu/t/an-innovative-social-investment-model-in-messina-sicily/9451/3", "created_at": "2020-08-16 09:41:32.814166", "updated_at": "2020-08-16 11:10:02.962599", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 470, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 18.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 74305, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 13206, "post_number": 1, "raw": "*These are notes from our community call on Coping with Loss of work. If you were there, feel free to press Edit below and make additions or changes. We focus on the new people in the conversation, so special thanks to @seh_notts for joining and sharing today.*\n\n\n@seh_notts is based in Nothingham, joined Edgeryders in 2014 when the unMonastery Matera adventure was on (!)\n@Noemi: facilitates the calls. Sees Edgeryders conversations over the years become more organic and more focused on wellbeing, not just project making.\n@MariaEuler: in Stockholm, in the country where they're not doing anything right now: 'we just follow the news of what others are doing. Some people stay in, but we also had neighbors downstairs having a party.'\nOlivier @oliiive: teaches French to people who are not native speakers: 'It's nice that on a weekly basis I have a contact with people.'\n\n@seh_notts **worked** **at a** **UK** **University for 20 years, largely in IT and** **now in** **a role supporting teachers to use technologies.**\n\n> Our team had to decide how we were going to respond immediately. Each Faculty came up with a teaching continuity plan, how they would continue, which platforms would be supported. Zoom was not used much. Lots of universities in the UK are Microsoft customers so a decision was made to use Microsoft Teams, as access is restricted only to the campus users so it is more private than Zoom. This concern about using Zoom proved to be a good one, given recent news stories about privacy issues with the platform.\n\n### What worked well/ not so well with the e-learning shift, and working as an educator online?\n\n> One of our senior staff already teaches a Distance Learning course online, and other colleagues had already contributed to MOOCs. Other than that, not many people appeared to be interested in the Edgeryder themes locally. \u2019\n\nAt the start of this crisis teachers had been on strike in the UK nationwide for two weeks before. The crisis refocused everything, because many Higher Education Institutions have made recent financial announcements to lay people off (\u2018furlough\u2019 them), if their roles were not considered essential at this time. Some disciplines (eg Arts and Humanities) feel more vulnerable in these circumstances. Furloughed staff are able to claim 80% of their wages from the Government but it is unclear how long this might be for or what the future might hold for all staff in the sector.\n\n### Challenges of eLearning and mental health\n\nThe main challenge with eLearning is going to be to enable students to continue to complete assessments. Many staff have experienced the mental impact of having to move to new and unfamiliar ways of working. When we asked about how students are doing, @seh_notts said:\n\n> I think the mental impact on students is huge and is not always fully appreciated by Higher Education Institutions. In the UK there is a real epidemic of anxiety and mental health issues among youngsters [in general]. Is this similar in other countries?\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/17/universities-having-to-adapt-fast-to-the-coronavirus-crisis \n\n\n## From around the Edgeryders network\n\nIn the past we have had students at UDK in Berlin speaking openly about mental health. But in that case, the connection was between creative focus and mental health, not so much the particularities of this age group.\n\n@pauline wrote this heartfelt story:\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/under-pressure-on-the-relationship-between-creativity-and-emotional-mental-health/647\n \n\n![SSNA1|690x448](upload://f19NCjZ5r2EcPQHBGNeYq7sCnF1.jpeg) \n\nIn a discussion problematising other similar conversations, our ethnographer was analysing the stories and commenting on the co-occurence of issues like mental health, art, and trauma: *I\u2019ve been seeing an expansion of the discussion on mental health\u2014 not just focused on refugee issues, but also mental health issues across populations. Youth come up frequently, as do feelings of hopelessness in the face of the current labour market. There has been a repetitive feeling of disconnect between one\u2019s own dreams and desires and the way cultural and social norms, as well as existing labour and $ structures, require one to live and attribute value to activities* [(source)](https://edgeryders.eu/t/new-round-of-coding-what-do-we-see/6081).\n\n## What is your experience with this issue?

Each with a contribution between 1k to 10k usd for example we can develop any Software infrastructure and rent offices in 1000 cities for a wear, finance a seed funding ourselves.\n\nI imagine a collaboration process based on the Open Enterprise model [https://www.opencompany.org/resources/whitepaper.pdf](https://www.opencompany.org/resources/whitepaper.pdf?fbclid=IwAR0K1wVbP4uekMYCBIKw45hHXopE6jKuWxaxGrZ5FhjGDJrU49wqDL2wJTo) or holacracy https://www.glassfrog.com/  with a landing page with profile mirroring (skills, interest, knowledge, ..like https://www.co-founders.club/NACE/ for new members, take some tutorial for orientation about how the process works, , check the open proposals/mission under discussion (loomio), check open projects, engage in open tasks, propose new ideas and new tasks, ..  https://www.comakery.com/\n\nThe Ai driven Business-peers incubation i have wrote about before is actually in this sense a process to transform new program  products of such an open enterprise  into reality. Most of entrepreneurs miss the standard skills like finance and marketing or coding to bring their business ideas\n\nThe problem is how to bring people to work on the same process? If they build it together! AND there is an economic value in it so we can survive while we are working together intensively to transform the world radically as one nation organization. \n\nI think thousands are working on similar solutions but without collaborating on it. I see the trajectory that within the next years we will see some of these solutions working and coming closer to each other so they produce better solutions. My issue, that we are losing and hurting more causing more destruction and extension  the more time we wait for global paradigm shift.\n\n#GlobalCommunityOpenEnterprise\n\n![](https://ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/images/cleardot.gif)\n\nOn Tue, 22 Oct 2019 at 13:48, Maria Euler via Edgeryders &lt;[contact@edgeryders.eu](mailto:contact@edgeryders.eu)&gt; wrote:\n\n> ![\\ 45x45](https://ci4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/sIlZKmjxRIHun8daWswNq_xUfRjska1sBHDrZp8dYksIJi2LzRnN5cwU9FLerQ-SlpEbfyAdMl74Z9u9maWaqjfhEDzxjE7IySadzBtbbHrfLcwEkbo8k6xsGA=s0-d-e1-ft#https://edgeryders.eu/user_avatar/edgeryders.eu/mariaeuler/45/9955_2.png) [MariaEuler](https://edgeryders.eu/u/mariaeuler)\n> October 22\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> I think this is a relevant topic for many people here and on their own in the world trying to balance idealistic ideas, the mental, technical and material resources to realize them and the necessities that life and society expect from them.\n>\n>\n>\n> When I am pinging anyone here I am by no means implying that you are not doing great and are moving forward amazingly with your project, but just that I know that you are dealing with this delicate balance act since you are working on idealistic project ideas of various size and form as well and if you feel like it, just share a few experiences of challenges and maybe even examples how you overcome them or adjust your thinking and acting to deal with them.\n>\n>\n>\n> [@JollyOrc](https://edgeryders.eu/u/jollyorc), [@BlackForestBoi](https://edgeryders.eu/u/blackforestboi), [@mrchrisadams](https://edgeryders.eu/u/mrchrisadams), [@eb4890](https://edgeryders.eu/u/eb4890)\n>\n>\n>\n> please ping people who are also balancing reality and realising dream projects!", "created_at": "2019-10-23 04:49:25.833320", "updated_at": "2019-10-24 23:25:04.494764", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 673, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 57.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62035, "user_id": 2567, "topic_id": 10326, "post_number": 50, "raw": "Definitely possible, yes we'll find the best place in the building for this to happen !", "created_at": "2019-10-23 09:00:06.608000", "updated_at": "2019-10-23 09:00:06.608000", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 16, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 29.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [61856], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 35076, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 6856, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2017-08-30 16:32:03.271637", "updated_at": "2017-08-30 16:32:03.271637", "deleted_at": "2018-03-09 17:23:34.307074", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 83066, "user_id": 6677, "topic_id": 13876, "post_number": 9, "raw": "I am not an economist as to be able to answer this 100% sure.\nBut for resilience, I would recommend always economic and money diversification.\nNot only fiat and social currency, but also exchange and gift economies, individual and collective.\nFor a world transition, I guess, first we would need a change in world's monetary system.

However, they offer the opportunity of playing with finance, via the residuals and margins discourse, and most important of all, to cut on the liability represented by personnel transforming it into an externality...\n\nHowever, the account of the personnel is just as partial as the discourse on amortisation of purchases: personnel grows qualitatively, often exponentially relatively to the investments in continuing education, and can be part of learning organisations, which is not true for machine learning (let's be reminded that today this is very far away from the inflated/hyped general artificial intelligence many imagine when thinking about deep learning and other machine learning approaches).\n\nThe challenge to us (and this is beyond journalism) is how to change this culture of accounting and management.

It's a scary inertia.\n\nSome economists have started: William H. Janeway is attacking the supremacy of efficiency, pushing effectiveness again in the limelight; Mariana Mazzucato is attacking the entire language of value, pushing back the tsunami of finance that keeps hold of our economies since the 1970s...\nBut we can work to speed some things up, and one would be proposing an alternative frame for accounting, where emphasis of what is measured is put on effectiveness and value creation...

He\u2019s been at events and workshops I\u2019ve attended, \u2026 and he\u2019s usually engaged in issues I\u2019d not yet thought about too much. One of the last times I\u2019d spoken to him he was organising around precarious workers issues. The next I came across Michael was through Edgeryders. His [post](https://edgeryders.eu/t/mobile-independent-clinic/827) raised some thought provoking points - what might be gained by seeing the migrant crisis as a training ground for other crisis? We met for a chat at a cafe so I could write up this intro and it was the first real opportunity I\u2019d had to find out a bit more about Michael\u2019s background.\n\nSo I asked him how he came to get involved in migrant solidarity and the other issues I knew he'd worked on. Michael was studying economics at university when he first got involved in environment justice campaigns. He started to see the way in which many of these issues linked up at a structural level. The budgets to fund nuclear submarines and missiles such as those based just outside Glasgow could be diverted to tackle necessary climate measures.\n\nMichael was involved in founding Plane Stupid Scotland - a campaign airport extension as the fastest growing cause of climate change. While there were successes that came from the campaign; the targeted airport expansions didn\u2019t go ahead - the campaign didn\u2019t achieve the growth of a movement that it had hoped might come about. Towards the end of the campaign people were left pretty exhausted - that topic of burnout that seems a pretty familiar theme on the Edgeryders platform. Michael experienced these tough times when you had to rest up from exhaustion as not all bad but as an opportunity to reflect, to learn and adapt. His resilience is rooted in gratitude even when things are hard going.\n\nFrom there Michael got involved in the Climate camps; Heathrow, Kent, Blackheath, Edinburgh and Mains Hill at the tail end of the anti-globalisation movements. The camps involved a lot of collective learning and opportunities to do things on a bigger scale. They were places to get exposed to new ideas and feel connected to other people in throughout the UK & EU. Michael understands their importance more as being a means to give people a taste of large scale communal protest experiences. He acknowledges they had less impact on climate issues but sees the camps as an empowerment process that fed in to other ventures and movements. \n\nThen he saw the wave of hope and optimism that was Copenhagen 2009 rise and fall. His memories of the experience were pretty bleak. This confirmed a change of direction that was away from protest politics towards more direct means to deliver change. He deliberately sought out issues that he'd researched as likely to become increasingly problematic in future years. \n\nThese two factors led him in to migrant solidarity. He got involved with the Unity Centre in Glasgow. This involved lots on legal case work, anti-deportation, and people in detention and housing rights. There Michael helped out with Unity's newly formed charity, which distributed clothes and other necessary items to those in need and with founding the Unity Cafe - a soup kitchen and food bank. Michael was involved with helping to house migrants before there were any night shelters in Glasgow. It was another period where he saw too few people doing too much. But he has warm memories - describing times when there were always people round for dinner. When they got by 'on their wits\u2019 by \u2018skipping' for food (rescuing food waste from the dump) and the sense of companionship and agency that came from finding a way to solve problems as they arose, finding another plate of food or another bed on the floor - at a time before these kind of actions became more popular. \n\nA logical progression from this work came in the form of the [Golden Trailer](https://edgeryders.eu/t/mobile-independent-clinic/827). A few friends watched Storming Sarajevo - and hatched an idea. It took two years between idea and implementation. They put useful skills like engineering, mechanics, nursing together with an abandoned trailer they\u2019d come across. They kitted the trailer out to offer basic medical aid, music, respite and a cinema to migrants in Italy and Serbia. You can read more about this on Michael\u2019s post here [link]. Some of the challenges were staying motivated while the idea got off the ground and started to take shape and pulling in untied funding. Funding that wasn\u2019t conditional enabled the trailer to respond to needs as they came across them - they weren\u2019t tied to a specific place and they could identify areas where other aid wasn\u2019t getting through and target these. \n\nThe experiences Michael had with the trailer were an opportunity to observe events first hand but he told me he'd started researching related issues prior to setting off. His research covered areas such as disaster sociology which suggests there is no such thing as a 'natural disaster\u2019 - rather there are always social factors that contribute to crisis. Other themes that drew Michael's interest included the influence that crisis can have on people\u2019s behaviours and responses - the well known tendency for people to take responsibility and demonstrate more solidarity during disasters. How could this tendency be cultivated beyond times of catastrophe? \n\nThese are the kind of topics Michael hopes to explore as part of the [Emergency Mutual Aid](https://edgeryders.eu/t/emergency-mutual-aid/6437) session on Day 2 of the Open Village. What are the barriers to this form of direct response and how do we overcome these? How might we turn hard-won personal experience in to collective expertise to up-scale a collective response?

The Brehon legal tradition, prior to its abolishment via the tanning case, was an ecological legal order, where the trees were divided into three classes in the forest, the nobles, the commoners,  and bushes, they had status,  based on their function as preserves of the life of the forest upon which the people depended. In a short few hundred years of common law the great forest was levelled to smelt iron ore for weaponary and to build the ships of colonialism. This push came from more ancient compatriots of your homeland, it is perhaps not surprising that you share a certain fatalism.\n\nWe live by our enstructured values and beliefs.\n\nIn the present we see efforts being made via the common legal tradition to revert to common legal practices. It is not a yearning for the past, but a recognition that the future without change is grim death at scale. It is also a recognition that the separatist extractive and self interested ego, in the pursuit of one or another form of power, is a prevailing feature of the detriment.\n\nOnly a fool denies that he needs to eat, and that the food must come of the land, and that the quality of each are important to one's well being and survival. That said, the world has ample evidence these days of such foolishness.\n\nIn the Daoist tradition the sage immortal is often found riding backwards on a donkey through the mountain villages. The children laugh and ask, 'why are you travelling, facing backward on the donkey?' - \"It is not me\", replies the sage, \"but rather that the donkey does not know where it is\ngoing\".\n\nTo know where one is is the key to taking appropriate next step. To know where one is, one must know how things have come to create the conditions of the present. Things ever come into being by the same process and as such cycles can be observed in the evolution of things. And so, as such, it is wisdom to look backward, as one moves forward, the ego is a donkey, it does not know where it is going.\n\nCare beyond the self beyond the family or  band is hardly a modern invention, though I appreciate where you are coming from. The Avalokitsevara details the 37 principles of the bodhisattva, an ancient acknowledgement of the spectrum on which all things find themselves. To one side pure nefarious self interest, to the far extreme on the other of bodhisattvic altruism. The distinction is one of practice, by which one comes to disidentify with personal as self, and take responsibility for all\nof creation, through the lived medium of self; that is, for practitioners. For the unpracticed life there is apparent separation in what is inherently unified, and an evolution from there of Lila, the will to live play breath bleed and die unto new life.\n\nEither way for us we want to live, with some degree of wellbeing, and this requires basic sustenance. You have posed a fatal argument,  basically that our nature is unchangeable and that we are fucked in the greater scheme of things, and while I agree to some extent, I can choose how I live. It is not by personal choice that I experience the breaking of the normal bodily function, near death, healing, and the change that that requires. I wish for others that they see the problem now as it is, and choose to heal, without the global  invention of dire necessity. In the meantime, conscious of the prevailing stupidity, it is wisdom to be prepared, and practiced in resilience on behalf of those short of insight.\n\nGood luck to us all.", "created_at": "2017-08-31 10:48:11", "updated_at": "2017-08-31 17:59:06.967134", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 627, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 7.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [35118], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 41643, "user_id": 3904, "topic_id": 7958, "post_number": 9, "raw": "Yes that was my thoughts exactly with repurposing.

It kicked off with a thought-provoking presentation from CEO Kirsten Dunlop. Most of it was about C-KIC itself, but here I would like to call our attention to its description of the context we find ourselves in. \n\n1. **1.5\u00b0 has failed**. Climate change marches on, and with it [the Jackpot](https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2020/02/william-gibson-apocalypse-it-s-been-happening-least-100-years): several social and environmental dynamics interacting in a complex way. 2020 is starting to look like a drill of what's to come. \n2. **But the global governance system seems to have shifted**, at least in Europe. Consider: \n    * EU Green New Deal: 1 trillion to be announced before the summer.\n    * Horizon Europe (the successor to Horizon 2020 for 2021-2027) is adopting a mission-driven approach, with climate-neutral cities and climate change adaptation (\"including societal transformations\") as two of the missions.\n    * Additionally, [the COVID stimulus is set at 2.4 trillion](https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response_en). A lot of that money also gets channeled towards climate-neutral, inclusive etc. etc. \n\nThere are no precedents of any human society throwing 3 trillion on the table. This will be a profound shock to the system, in good and in bad ways. It is also a one-off: it can be a large opportunity, maybe it will be used well, maybe not. But our generation won't get another. \n\nA shock that is easy to foresee: all financial and administrative pipelines will get clogged. Our public sector simply does not have that capacity. Spending bodies are going to need help, boots on the ground, eyes on the street, makers of maps. \n\nIntuitively, **there seems to be a role for collective intelligence here**. A lot of sensemaking is needed, for one; and the need for participatory process is only going to increase, as exhausted bureaucrats handle scary amounts of money, under punishing deadlines, at considerable cost to their careers in case of mishandling. In terms of a high-level strategy, **I would like Edgeryders to claim a role, forge collective intelligence into a sharper tool for contributing to the societal transition, and try to make a positive impact.** I can think of valuable work to be done by the [Research Network](https://research.edgeryders.eu), [EarthOS](#earthos), the [Culture Squad](#culture-squad), the [Sci-Fi Economics Lab](#earthos:sci-fi-economics), [The Reef](#earthos:the-reef)... we have been working on this very same transition since 2011.  \n\nBut we don't live at the high level. We live at the ground level of the current projects, our growing, but still limited, network of business partners, the next batch of calls. I have no idea how, in practice, we would respond to a historical challenge like this. **What do I need to do tomorrow to help us all take a step in the direction of becoming contributors to the transition? What do you?** \n\nTogether with the Edgeryders board, I will be thinking hard about this question in the coming weeks and months.

Seeing that the first use case for Realities is the Borderland, we'd like to have a version of it ready around January 2019. This means that we'd have to get started as soon as possible.\n\nCurrently, @erikfrisk is working on getting the basics ready. By the time he's done, [the Borderland will have an event on October 20th](https://www.facebook.com/events/1022532107944976/) to test the current version and to define some feature requests, recommendations and use cases. After that, we're ready to do a Particip.io hackathon to experiment and co-design, followed by a focused development week where 2-4 people will work full time on getting the next release of Realities ready and running. \n\nCurrently, my idea is to have a hackathon followed by a development week in the last two weeks of November.\n\n**Proposed dates, pending availability of developers, are:**\n**Hackathon:** November 16-18\n**Focused development:** November 19-25\n\nFor the Hackathon, we need a mix of skilled developers and other people with great ideas and the willingness to learn and contribute. It will be open to up to 10 people, and accommodation, food and travel are payed for.\n\nFor the development week, only people who've already contributed to the code before the hackathon are eligible. Being on this team for the week following the hackathon means that accommodation for that week is payed for, and in addition to that there is 1000 EUR compensation for 7 days together (and also, I imagine, quite a bit of fun). Following a hackathon with a development week also allows people who've contributed to the hackathon to spend some time with us during the development weeks and, if they want to, put in some volunteer hours and contribute to the code to be eligible for future development weeks or freelance work.\n\nSince we need experience with the codebase for the development week, that means that we're probably limited to the eight developers who've currently contributed to the [Realities repository on GitHub](https://github.com/theborderland/realities/graphs/contributors). This means that I need commitment from at least some of them to make these dates work, and I've reached out to them to post their availability status here. However, if someone else makes vetted contributions to the repository in the coming month, that person could be eligible too, but I'm not counting on that on such short notice.\n\nLocation of the hackathon and development week will depend a bit on the availability of key developers to travel, but if possible I'm pretty excited about the idea to maybe base it in Medenine, Tunisia. @haykel and @Yosser, still in early stages and can't confirm anything right now, but what do you think about that?", "created_at": "2018-09-13 15:45:40.659477", "updated_at": "2018-09-28 11:27:45.588355", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 483, "wiki": false, "reads": 29, "score": 605.8, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 3812, 4635], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28067, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 2715, "post_number": 14, "raw": "<b>Let's have a google hangout instead?</b>\n\nGuys, like Ben I am seeing a lot of speaking at and past one another.

Event description**\n\n_Overview of the event:_\nBehind every social innovation, there is a great story to tell. Our experience incubating social innovators showed that the most-exciting projects are not the most data-rich or the most clever, but those that have the best stories. And who is better to hear our stories than kids?\n&ldquo;KID PITCH&rdquo; is a presentation session in which 8 social innovators pitch their ideas in front of a judges panel constituted of 5 kids. Social innovators are required to take the judges through their journey and answer all the questions asked by the panel. The social innovator will have only 5 mn to present, followed by 8 mn questions from the judges&rsquo; panel. The judges&rsquo; panel will be constituted of 5 curious kids between the ages of 10 and 12 that are actively engaged with [Sciencia](http://www.sciencia.tn/about), a Tunisian social enterprise that works on offering a set of products and services for kids to enjoy discovering and learning Sciences and Technologies.\nParticipation criteria for social innovators will be defined by the leading organization.\n\n_The objective of the event:_\nIn the entrepreneurial sphere, it is said that if you can&rsquo;t explain your business model well enough for kids to understand, then you are not ready for prime time in front of investors.\n&ldquo;KID PITCH&rdquo; event aims at improving social innovators&rsquo; ability to communicate their projects succinctly and compellingly based on a strongly grounded story. The ability to communicate effectively will make them more prepared to engage with investors, partners, and other potential actors.\n\n_The benefits of the event to your community:_\nKids are very honest and are comfortable asking unbiased questions about things they don&rsquo;t understand. By having a panel made of kids, entrepreneurs are pushed to hedge their language and practice the art of simplicity and conciseness. The skills are extremely crucial when it comes to pitching for funding, measuring impact and seeking partnerships.\nThe social innovator winner will receive the KID PITCH award which consists of a professional video for his/her project made by the leading organization and communicated through all its channels.\nThis event is not only helping change the way that social innovators pitch their ideas but also it allows kids to learn critical thinking, practice problem-solving skills and see entrepreneurialism in action.\nThe selected 8 social innovators will post their projects on the Edgeryders platform to connect with the global online community.\n\n**B. Proposed Program**\nKID PITCH is a one-day event that brings together 8 social innovators willing to enhance their presentation and communication skills and refine their project pitch.\nThe morning session will be a 2-hour intensive training on storytelling and presentation skills. After that, participants will be given 1 hour to refine their pitch and practice their presentation. After the lunch break, the open presentation session will take place for 2 hours. Following the winner announcement and the vote of thanks for judges and participants, the attendees will be invited for a networking buffet in which social innovators get to receive more feedforward from the attendees. The event will take place on Saturday, November 30th.\n![Proposed%20Program|613x265](upload://t7Tbt3DGnQwuZsbzSj3kTWPxsps.png)\n\n**D.

Thank you for sharing this, and for your work in this space.\n\nYou probably know these cases, but since some others in this thread seemed interested also in related/relevant/analogous examples from (kind of, at least structurally) adjacent areas including IoT and AI, here are a few that might be interesting in the sense that I hope they complement your argument:\n\n* At our most recent annual ThingsCon conference (2018), Manon den Dunnen shared her experience of reporting gone bad through unintented consequences when police officers would exchange phone numbers with both victims of crimes as well as suspects, and the Facebook apps would often do its network matching/contact proposal thing and *directly propose to connect victim and suspect/perpetrator*. It's quite horrific, and a super important case study about data minimization and network mining (it's also a short video): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6MRVQG8Vh0\n* A number of studies have shown algorithmic bias at its worst where policing and/or justice related algorithms were trained on training sets that had massively racist data points, including statistics created based on policing behavior that was deemed illegal/racist by courts at the time, but somehow remained part of the data sets. (AI Now Institute has mentioned this multiple times across their annual AI Now reports.)\n* NYC's policing algorithm (in)famously measures effectiveness by fairly simply metrics like numbers of arrests and severity of the causes of arrests. This has created horrific incentives for police to report highly selectively so as not to ruin their (perceived) performance, including going so far as to structurally intimidate rape victims to change their charges from rape to minor offenses. The podcast [Reply All had a mini series](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/o2hx34) on it that's very accessible.\n\nThose just came to mind and maybe they're helpful for some of the people reading here. And I couldn't agree more with your conclusion that tech won't be the solution to a complex social issue such as this. \n\nThanks again @katejsim for sharing this.", "created_at": "2019-11-01 14:51:12.686311", "updated_at": "2019-11-01 14:51:12.686311", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 354, "wiki": false, "reads": 21, "score": 89.2, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 4934, 2915, 1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16906, "user_id": 472, "topic_id": 1281, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>\"Dades amb Pa amb Tom\u00e0quet\"</b>\n\n<span><span>Grazie</span> <span>Alberto</span><span>,</span> <span>\u00e8</span> <span>una bella storia</span><span> :)</span></span>\n\nLyne said: \"If you want something done right, do it yourself\".\n\nI prefer another proverb: \"Better ask for forgiveness than permission,\" I have used it several times ...\n\nThere are some things in your story I want to comment:\n\n1 .- You say that Spaghetti Open Data - yes, it is one of the best names of OpenData services :) - is prior to the official italian government portal OpenData. Is the Italian Government did not consider that he had a OpenData portal in Italy was offering open data?, As we say in Spain, does the Italian Government reinvented the wheel?\n\n2 .- I personally love that Spaghetti Open Data is created by civil society itself, is the best way this portal offers useful service to society. But also acknowledge that if the government gets involved much better, especially because it is who has more data and better quality, as well as financing for the portal.\n\n3 .- I do not understand why statistical data can not be opened. In fact, I believe that statistical departments are a major source of data to supply OpenData portals. Another issue is to discuss whether these data are \"raw data\" or data developed. I personally believe that, in general, are not \"raw data\" although specific level, and depending on each reuse can be reached as \"raw data\", so the difference is not clear... but, is it important?, the important is the data reuse, nothing else.\n\nCongratulations for this initiative!\n\nIn Catalonia we should have created \"Dades amb &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pa_amb_tom%C3%A0quet\"&gt;Pa amb Tom\u00e0quet&lt;/a&gt;\" portal :)\n\nMarcG\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-23 23:14:29", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:34.498014", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 327, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62445, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 11285, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Heads up: there is a Deep Dive call scheduled for 17.00.", "created_at": "2019-10-29 10:01:50.798303", "updated_at": "2019-10-29 10:01:50.798303", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 12, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 12.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 15811, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 6249, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Looks promising</b>\n\nI used to have a contact in the Commission...

They believe (for their report) that lack of education is the key to fixing the other stuff, so to be constructive and make our point be heard, let's say it is so.\n\nThough I believe it is not: better education (even in its broadest sense) is not the only measure to take. It is sufficient as the only goal (thought experiment: everybody wakes up tomorrow morning with the perfectly educated mindset and the best values on earth ... we'd not have suicide etc. problems, not even need police and neither government). But to arrive at best education, it needs more than directly implementing it via schools etc.: we can't program people by uploading some data, instead only immerse them in great healthy environments for long times and hope it helps. So, we need not just schools, but also something against bullying etc.. (And probably, we should avoid schools!)\n\nSo maybe focus on education / empowerment / value aquisition, including \"provising healthy environments\" for that. And see what Edgeryders have come up with for that. I'm thinking of James Wallbank and Access Space for example.\n\nI agree about avoiding buzzword soup (by all means). Instead of recommending action directly, I would propose a collection of 20 real-world off-center solution examples form Edgeryders, and then a short section that derives trends and action recommendations from that. I know policy documents always indulge in generic terms, and that's why they are so powerless in my view :D So I'd have no issue with an out-of-the-box form that focuses on Edgeryders examples instead.\n\nJust my 2c worth of proposals of course!\n\n", "created_at": "2012-07-18 18:06:04", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:23.511002", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 302, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [24642], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 75289, "user_id": 4022, "topic_id": 13261, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Blivande is happy to continue in the Reef network.", "created_at": "2020-04-28 21:52:08.532225", "updated_at": "2020-04-28 21:52:08.532225", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 9, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 27.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23926, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 4987, "post_number": 12, "raw": "Hey hey\n\n\u00a0\n\nI was just in a bus from utrecht to brussels and guess what.

Odysseus works with Elementary OS, and it's available from its AppCenter.

He wanted to have a place where they'd have these machines (laser cutters, cncs where they could cut/repair/remanufacture things in service of the municipality). There is a big problem with vandalism in the city. On one side, we'll be able to make things, and on the other those who usually break things could maybe get involved to build something, for a change.

I am curious about how my own projects will be impacted by other edgeryders and feel energized and supported for my upcoming ventures.\n\nPeter Skead", "created_at": "2019-11-24 16:42:48.519077", "updated_at": "2019-11-24 16:42:48.519077", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 202, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 31.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 69636, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 12557, "post_number": 12, "raw": "love this!!!!!!!!!!!", "created_at": "2020-01-30 11:09:39.326926", "updated_at": "2020-01-30 11:09:39.326926", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 22.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [69633], "is_liked_by": [4022], "is_private": false}, {"id": 72850, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 13019, "post_number": 1, "raw": "*Hi! This is a guide to help you generate an online conversation on edgeryders.eu on a theme of deep interest to you. It is a wiki document, so you can help improve it by clicking on the <kbd>Edit</kbd> button at the end of the post.*\n\nThe material below is useful if: you have taken on a role of a community manager, community engager, storycrafter or similar, and you set out to create a conversation that engages many different edgeryders members and newcomers.\n\n# What is a conversation?\n\nA conversation on edgeryders.eu takes place in different posts ('topics') across the forum with a common theme, and the reactions ('replies' or comments) they each generate. It can span a single project category - [Wellbeing in Europe,](https://edgeryders.eu/c/wellbeing) [Internet of Humans](https://edgeryders.eu/c/ioh) etc. or it can span different projects - like [covid19](https://edgeryders.eu/tags/covid19). It really doesn't matter much for our purpose here.\n\nSome elements of a conversation unfolding on edgeryders.eu are:\n\n* **Call(s) for participation**: topics created by the hosts of the conversation inviting the community to contribute content and expertise to figure something out, collaboratively. \n* **Sourced stories:** high quality, carefully edited stories that are authored by either community members or hosts, and act as seeds for the conversation. They are contributions to your theme, contain knowledge with some level of expertise, creativity and craft, and are promoted across the network to inspire new contributions. Example:  \n* **Spontaneous new stories (and comments):** community contributions coming in as a result of the call and source stories. This is crowdsourced content that helps grow everyone's understanding of the theme, and leads to collective intelligence: emerging insights, ideas, projects that come about through the ongoing conversations.\n\nIn all of these, edgeryders community managers provide support, help connect the theme with ongoing conversations, page community members onto the new topics created etc.\nEdgeryders outreach team is helping promote the calls for participation and the incoming stories.\n\n# Ways to source stories\n\nPick those that work best for you, and start anywhere. Really, done is better than perfect.\n\n* Decide on a theme you wish to explore in depth (duh!)\n* **Summarize existing content on edgeryders.eu on the theme** and its related aspects. A good tip is to use the Search function and type in the theme, or any other related words. See this example for #covid19. Read through the results carefully and create a new post with your personal reflections and conclusions. End the post with a call to action: what should readers react to? what questions should they answer?\nExample: [Heroines of Poland: which of these three stories speaks to you the most?](https://edgeryders.eu/t/heroines-of-poland-which-of-these-three-stories-speaks-to-you-the-most/10037)\n\n* **Interview or chat with someone from your network with experience/ expertise** on the given theme. Ideally this is a person with deep lived experience, or strong expertise, authoritativeness, or charismatic figure. There could be many people with knowledge on your theme, so start anywhere! Don't forget to report back in a post. \nExample: [\u201cIs the communitarian Internet back in the wake of COVID-19?\u201d A conversation with Howard Rheingold ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/is-the-communitarian-internet-back-in-the-wake-of-covid-19-a-conversation-with-howard-rheingold/12971)\n\n* **Publish your own story!** Setting the example is a good way to get started and inspire others!\nExample: [On being a self-entrepreneur](https://edgeryders.eu/t/on-being-a-self-entrepreneur/633)\n\n* **Host an online community call or a series or a webinar.**\nDecide on an appropriate channel for the call:\n1. Edgeryders zoom call: we have a subscription. \n2. Edgeryders own call room: https://calls.edgeryders.eu/\n3. Any other channel works.\nThe important things are: you should announce it about a week ahead on edgeryders.eu and/or social media; you need to facilitate it; you need to create a summary/notes with what was discussed during the call and what the next steps are. \nExample of documented call: [How can community foundations and local NGOs maintain their programs and move online? ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/how-can-community-foundations-and-local-ngos-maintain-their-programs-and-move-online/12899) \nReference: [Community Management Manual - how to organise community calls](https://edgeryders.eu/t/cohttps://edgeryders.eu/t/community-management-manual/2245#heading--2-2-1mmunity-management-manual/2245#heading--2-2-1)\nOur community managers will help you and set it up.

Please try to write every word \u2013 sometimes a single word can unlock a lot of thoughts!**\n\nThere is an space-project happening in Berlin called *ComINunion* that aims to open and establish a culture of just being together again. There is no need to do anything there and still it is an open space and anything that the people who join would like to share, be and experience, can happen. It is meant to be rather an encounter than \"another event\" (there are soooo many), taking place on a regular basis (2 a month) in a closed group of people who pay a \"membership\". \n\nDuring the exchange the idea of an incubator for ones own being comes up. Yes, *ComINunion* could be an incubator of being and becoming ones best version of oneself - to love oneself and enjoy others and diversity.\n\nBeyond the monthly meetings offline, there is a closed online group on facebook where the members can meet, share, ask for support, bringing a soup when one is sick. It is really about a *feeling of belonging* and sharing, whilst providing an open space and freedom.\nThere is no fix programme of the happenings, yet fix programmes can be set from time to time depending on what we want do experience/share/create/do/be.\n\nThe membership is good and important for\n- the valuation of the \"community manager\" and her energy and work and time and dedication\n- paying the spaces\n- calling upon comittment and the decision \"yes, I really want to be a part of this group\" \n\nThe group is closed which allows a certain flow of intimacy and yet it  opens every 3 months to new members.\n\nThe comittment is also in terms of 3 months which means that after 3 months a person can leave.\n\nIt is a prototype..3.0 of \"such encounters\" that Freyma does initiate and facilitates. \n\nIt is actually only going to happen with at least 12 people and max 22 in a run of one year.. and then we will see :)\n\nFreyma envisions it as a possibility of a means for a \"new\" culture of community in an urban setting.\nActually everything is there already.. just the how of the creation of the space and its set, regular meetings, and that there is no one guru and no one idea is different. *ComINunion* is lived diversity.\n\nThe question arises of how to reach enough people.\n\n\n**Where does it go from here? How do you want to continue? What are you curious to explore next?**\n\nThe first encounter happened. Two more for 2019 are in the line and in 2020 we actually start - regularly and focussed.\n\nThe idea comes up to make a video and explain the space of *ComINunion* \n\nI am curious to explore how it is going to dismantle and what time and process will show to us.\n\nI am curious if there is anything similiar happening somewhere on this sweet earth\n\n\n\n**name:** Freyma", "created_at": "2019-11-24 22:29:00.439860", "updated_at": "2019-11-24 22:29:00.439860", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 528, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 66.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4934, 5144], "is_private": false}, {"id": 66201, "user_id": 3703, "topic_id": 11858, "post_number": 7, "raw": "Hello @mohamed75 \nIf I understand well, your team has already developed the prototype?

I wonder if there's some extrapolation that can be taken from them.\n\nFirstly, many supermarkets in the Uk have charity partners in the local community. They hold them for 3-4 months each. Every shopper who spends over a set amount (i think it is \u00a320) is given a small plastic token. They are then encouraged to drop these tokens into a box by the main doors, selecting one of the 3 charities to recieve their donation.\n\nAt the end of the period the tokens are collected and counted and all the charities recieve the amount of money that has been donated to each box from the supermarket company. Its a basic mechanism and it only raises small amounts of cash, but the charities are often very small. Also, (and i think this ties in with your idea in a comment above) the money raise goes towards the delivery of a specific project or purchase.\n\nIt is often the case in the UK that fundraising from grant making charities is tied directly to projects. It is very hard to get funding to cover ongoing overheads, and business expenses.\n\nI think that this model would work best with the Fairbnb platform. People chosing to use the platform as hosts and 'customers' would be able to see the successes that funded projects provide,. I assume that a large section of the platform would be dedicated to sharing the success stories with the service users?\n\nI know i would look to use a service like this instead of an airbnb service if it were available.\n\nI guess my question would be what plans do you have for encouraging participation in the platform outside of major cities? I can foresee that these are the areas where uptake of new platforms are often slowest, but that they are often areas with high levels of charity support and high levels of poverty. I'm thinking for example of an area like Cornwall in England (high use of holiday lettings and airbnb style accommodation, but also high levels of regional un/under-employment and low levels of Government engagement in service delivery)\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-18 13:24:02", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:16.743103", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 414, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 79039, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 13898, "post_number": 2, "raw": "guys @katejsim is already here, hey Kate!", "created_at": "2020-06-17 11:52:54.179905", "updated_at": "2020-06-17 11:52:54.179905", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 7, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 17.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5479], "is_private": false}, {"id": 75177, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 13171, "post_number": 9, "raw": "@lylycarrillo, we had to leave zoom.

It's an event that focuses on  **accelerating learning between a broad range of participants who are driving environmental change in their own community** , both in ports and other industries and creative hubs where innovation happens.\n\nFrihamnen, the port in which we are located, has been the main container terminal in Stockholm. In 2020 it will be replaced by Stockholm Norvik Port, while Frihamnen will keep receiving ferries to Finland and the Baltics, as well as larger cruise ships. In the next decade, the development of a new residential area will commence. Blivande is one of the very first new creative communities that move into Frihamnen. \n\n## Blivande at the Ports of Stockholm\n\n![46493162_1942022589434306_1586453502010327040_o|690x505](upload://wqKpDEHrWbJax3HNitfog6Au4zJ.jpeg) \n\n\nWhat can creative communities contribute to innovation in maritime hubs? Our community organization Blivande is working with the Ports of Stockholm to answer that question. In November last year, we got the keys to a 1000 square meter house in one of the harbors of Stockholm.\n\nThis house is now home to a growing ecosystem of initiatives and organizations. Over 300 people have some affiliation with Blivande and make a monthly financial contribution. Most are monthly donors of 10 EUR per month and participate in daily community events, but some have moved their art practice or business to Blivande. Blivande houses a workshop for makers, artists and professionals craftspeople. We have a beautiful co-working space with a creative and familiar vibe. \n\nBlivande is an especially good fit for entrepreneurs who need access to both beautiful offices and light machinery and equipment for prototyping. Having space for entrepreneurs that create something material or do contract work sets us aside from other co-working spaces. We are not an incubator trying to foster the next killer app, we are first and foremost a community and an ecosystem where people benefit from each other's skills and services. Businesses at Blivande include a welder, a plumber, a simulation expert who builds his own sensors, two architects, a robotics expert, a YouTuber, multiple programmers, an industrial designer, two photographers and artists in a wide range of disciplines. \n\n## Urban Heritage and Creative Communities \n\nIn UNESCOs [Recommendation on the Historic Urban Landscape](https://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/638), Urban Heritage is roughly taken to mean that a place contains traces of past generations. Keeping traces of what came before creates continuity and identity in a city. For us at Blivande, this means that when the freight containers disappear from Frihamnen, we would like to keep some of them behind. This is exactly what creative communities are often good at doing in industrial and post-industrial environments.\n\nFrihamnen just celebrated its 100th anniversary. In honor of its history, we collaborated with the Ports of Stockholm to build the first phase of a creative hub with containers. We built a colorful container village full of art and activities as a backdrop for their celebrations, which now gets to stay for at least one year, and hopefully longer.\n\n![21_09_2019_%20Blivande%20at%20Frihamnen%20Live%20(5)|690x388](upload://oPme7koPv2WnAUAuqnH16f5nwke.jpeg) \n\n![71594751_2488691034527996_6375157404996206592_o|669x690](upload://rhZawD2AZdNrqh6XwL0jPbJPHLK.jpeg) \n\n![IMG_0448|690x517](upload://s8Bi0qEfUiWSnUNmrqezx1F2oxk.jpeg) \n\n\nOur colorful container village allows us to:\n\n* Build exhibition rooms for the art created at Blivande, as well as provide space for outside artists to exhibit their works in containers, on top of them, and in the square.\n* Create space for a caf\u00e9 and restaurant, especially to create an attractive public place for the summer months when the demand for indoor event spaces dips in Stockholm.\n* Experiment with free public space and invite citizen initiatives to try ideas that would be difficult to get approval for in a public park or square.\n* Create room in containers for more heavy machinery that we can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to have indoors. For example, a laser cutter which needs ventilation, a noise CNC mill or welding.\n* Give space to a lightweight industry zone outside the house needed by some of our members.\n\nFrihamnstorget should be a true \u201c[third place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place)\u201d. It is not just a place for culture and art but is itself a beautiful and exciting work of art. Frihamnstoget questions established principles of city planning and placemaking in Sweden today, and we are tilling the earth for the creativity of its members.\n\nFrihamnstorget is a work of art with no single vision. It is co-created by the initiatives and creativity of the different people and organizations involved. This process of co-creating a public place through citizen initiative is itself a work of art and an experiment in democracy and creativity. It should feel like a tiny container village, full of art and culture, but also workshops for craftspeople, creative businesses, food, and drink.\n\nFrihamnstorget and Blivande should also be a foundation for community-run and community-owned businesses, creating an opportunity for people to create good lives for themselves and others.\n\n## Temporary permanence: Learning from other port cities\n\nAs we all know, nothing lasts forever. Eventually, our containers will have to be moved. However, some buildings live longer lives than others. For example, we are hoping to stay in the house for at least 10 years. Other structures we occupy or build might have shorter lifespans. You might call it a philosophy of _temporary permanence_. We are learning a lot on how to build a community in these conditions from the creative communities of Aarus. One of them is [Institute for (X)](https://institutforx.dk/), perhaps our biggest inspiration for Frihamnstorget.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Carw5-0ipKg\n\nInstitute for (X) have become experts at building \"temporarily permanent\" structures that create infrastructure for creative communities. \n\n![43|690x455](upload://rv3UDB1Ru4SMdij8crXyQliVOli.jpeg) \n\nIntegrating these sorts of structures into industrial or post industrial spaces can mean that areas that would otherwise be devoid of human activity and culture suddenly come to life. Institute for (X) have referred to this as moving from a model of instant reconstruction which leaves big open wounds in a cityscape for years.\n\n![50|690x475](upload://43Zmwi2S4ASgsjsl5SSOiT0fzyM.jpeg) \n\n## Adaptive reuse as a green policy\n\nAn important part of becoming more sustainable and energy-efficient is to switch to more modern technology. New technology often requires new buildings and infrastructure. One example of this is how container freight shipping makes warehouses in ports largely redundant. \n\nAccording to the World Green Building Council, 11% of worldwide carbon emissions come from construction. This means that the embodied carbon footprint of a building is immensely important. If a building is in use for longer, more value is extracted from that embodied carbon. Putting these buildings to use instead of tearing them down might be among the most efficient sustainability actions one can undertake.\n\nOf course, old buildings have other problems. They are badly insulated and air-conditioning or heating them is often very inefficient. This causes problems if you rebuild them into hotels, traditional apartments or high-end offices. Creative communities often solve these things differently as they are often looking to minimize costs. Expensive air-conditioning often isn't an option. A music venue, a photo studio, an art workshop or a gallery space does not have to be temperature controlled in the way an office does. Creative communities also often find innovative ways around these challenges, like building custom insulated parts inside buildings.\n\nIt's also the case that a high concentration of creative communities is likely to foster experiments in urban greening. It's hard to imagine that the wildly successful [High Line Park](https://www.thehighline.org/history/) would have become a reality without the creative communities of New York pushing for it. A bridge with a huge embodied carbon footprint became a green oasis. \n\n## Discussions at Deep Dive\n\nI'm really looking forward to the discussions we will have at Deep Dive. Involving and nurturing creative communities is only one aspect of developing sustainable maritime hubs, but I think that the case for creative communities being a way to extend the life of buildings and infrastructure and lowering the impact of the embodied carbon footprint could be an especially interesting topic to explore.\n\n*Supported by:*\n\n![EIT-Climate-KIC-EU-flag|690x254](upload://fsdKpqMpGPFDTcZgx338atkSh0Y.jpeg)", "created_at": "2019-10-23 00:53:18.431527", "updated_at": "2020-01-22 16:19:13.448920", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1407, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 473.2, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 4, 5201, 4096, 2551], "is_private": false}, {"id": 78083, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 13702, "post_number": 7, "raw": "The call is for 90 min from 3rd June, 5PM CEST.

Community members, on the one hand, find escaping the bubbles they grew up in (this often manifests in the concrete experience of deciding to `leave one's home country` and go somewhere else) leads to `personal growth` and change. The bubble-worlds of their home countries, while sometimes feeling safe, feel limiting. \n\nBut there's an interesting thing that happens after that -- often, they seek another kind of bubble in another place-- this time, around shared beliefs and `values` rather than shared `national identity`. \n\nThere's an interesting tension that emerges here, though. Many community members say that it was in encountering difference (people from different places, with different worldviews) that they developed as a person, grew and developed their own values. \n\nHowever, there is another kind of difference that community members avoid -- they cite a `values mismatch` between them and other people (sometimes these are people from their home country, who haven't changed their ways of thinking, or people in the new country whose politics and ways of life seem alien and wrong). \n\nMy first research question proceeding from this, then, is: **what kind of encounters with human difference are enriching, pushing you outside of your comfort zone to grow as a person, and which kinds of difference do you avoid because you see it as damaging? How do you know this beforehand?** \n\nI find it fascinating that encounters with difference have the capacity to both grow us and negatively affect us, and am interested to dig deeper into the kinds of pushing outside of one's bubble that are productive, and which are not. As a follow-up question, I'd like us to interrogate the bubbles more: **When is a bubble a way of hiding from other views that might lead to the kind of expansion of worldview that many community members cite as central to their growth and development as humans, and when are bubbles a way of building safe communities away from threat? How can we tell the difference, when encountering difference (getting outside of bubbles) is often what pushes us to grow and change, too?** \n\nI'm also interested in interrogating the relationship between one's origin country and one's adopted country -- there's an emotional element to the writings on this by communities so far that have been interesting. Some find a deep `emotional connection` to the politics in their origin countries, even after having been away for years, that they cannot develop in new countries (often because they never feel totally a part of the culture in the new country, often hanging out only in bubbles with other transplants). Others try to immerse themselves in the new country and `disconnect emotionally` with the old. But it seems, by and large, that those old ties remain strong emotionally.\n\n This leads me to ask about people's decisions to stay or go, and then after that to stay connected or detach: community members have talked about this in terms of a kind of `fight-or-flight` response. So I'm interested in the question of **how we decide whether to fight developments we see as negative, particularly in our countries of origin, and how we decide to detach and focus our limited energies elsewhere?** This is related to the bubbles question -- **do you stay and work to better your old communities that were yours by birth and upbringing, or do you turn away from trying to change other people and instead build your own communities, of like-minded people?** I want to be clear that there isn't a right or wrong answer here, but I'm seeing different strategies emerge, both which have significant emotional impacts on people. Leaving is hard (physically leaving and emotionally detaching from politics): but so is staying. \n\nThere is another question worth exploring, which is: **how do we design events that will be impactful in addressing and acting on actual issues that people face?** I expect to see links in the SSNA between `event planning, non-transformative, defining purpose, solidarity networks and building collaborations`. This is, of course, a question near and dear to us at Edgeryders. Community members have attended a lot of non-transformative events, in which panels of 'experts' talk at them, with little visible connections to actual issues they face or little commitment to concretely producing social change. **How do we invent better blueprints for transformative, impactful events? How do we move away from the same rote, flat scripts and formats? Can we fork, instead of fighting, or is fighting necessary to enact change in powerful spaces that refuse to change** (e.g. spaces we all have to inhabit in which white dudes with power talking at everyone) -- related to the above questions on bubbles and where to engage/spend your time and who to spend your time with. \n\n Beyond these questions, I see topics that I expected to see: a dislike of `patriotism`, which many feel leads to `alienation` and `exclusion` of groups based on identity markers (race, ethnicity, class); overreach of institutions like the Church that perpetuate` traditional (harmful) values` (though some see the Church as a potentially positive entity in political and social transformation), and how to tackle `ignorance` and `indifference` (though some think that cultivating indifference can be healthy, when it comes to things you can't change (follow-up question: **how do you decide when people or situations can't be changed?**). \n\nI expect to see a lot more tensions and questions emerge as we go on, and would love to hear more voices and stories on the English platform to work on! \n\nI'm also looking forward to reading the preliminary write-ups of the rest of the ethnography team: @Jirka_Kocian, @Jan, @Maja, @supernova.    \n\n@noemi @natalia_skoczylas @alberto @nadia @inge @johncoate @hugi", "created_at": "2019-11-14 10:16:02.989903", "updated_at": "2019-11-14 22:08:42.773436", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1002, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 211.4, "like_count": 8, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 4022, 1856, 4096, 2915, 4, 3206, 428], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8814, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 4706, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>The deepest story from Future Makers</b>\n\nThis was for me a highlight ever since I read it a year ago, and now revisiting it with\u00a0great interest.

Exact reproducibility in a quantitative sense is obviously out of the question, so many scholars decide they have no duty to make the reasoning leading to their papers transparent. So, we have no best practice to fall on. The main epistemological move behind SSNA is to treat conversational exchanges as data. That makes it natural to adopt the culture of data stewardship that comes from different communities, in my case the open data community.\n\nWhen we documented OpenCare, it worked like this. \n\n1. At the beginning of the project, we wrote a [data management plan](https://github.com/opencarecc/opencare-data-documentation/blob/master/Data%20management%20plan/Data_in_Opencare.pdf). This type of document is now a requirement for EU-funded research.\n1. Graphryder fetches the data from the edgeryders.eu database via API. So, we [documented the API itself](/t/7904).

That makes a lot of sense and I agree it is important to document the research process. In our case, we have started to do that by writing down our coding memos in which we explain why and how we make decisions, as well as ask each other questions. As @amelia mentioned we plan to publish these regularly on the platform. \n\nOne of the things I was struck by in your initial email was the capture of data with regards to time spent on the platform (\"for example, the duration of the conversation can be inferred from the timestamps of the posts; the duration of the coding from the timestamps of the annotations; the number of researchers involved from the names of the annotations\u2019 authors\"). \n\nI was wondering to what extend there had been an epistemic-level conversation about what this kind of data does and does not capture? Because time-stamps are only partial data, in the sense that a 2 hour coding session on one thread could tell you: 1. it was long, 2. it was complicated, or 3. it was interrupted by, the need to read up, (grab a coffee), go back to some literature, 4. some other reason entirely etc. etc.  \n\nI think this might be an interesting conversation to circle back to once we get to a stage of (meta) analysis of such data. \n\nanyways, just my .2 cents!

More/better photos, the design of the cooking\u00a0 module could/should be 3D modelled (there are photos I added a couple of months back on the <a href=\"http://www.appropedia.org/Forest_biochar_rocket_stove\">Appropedia page</a>) etc.\n\nThere are possible improvements to the design that could be implemented, but this is probably more suited to a new build rather than modifying the existing stove.\n\nIm also planning to interview some of the people that have regularly used it for cooking to see if they have any thoughts about improvements.\n\nInterested in what you make of everything and how you may like to be involved?\n\n", "created_at": "2015-10-31 17:55:28", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:21.942728", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 235, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 6.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 49169, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 9229, "post_number": 13, "raw": "Yep, same for mee!! thanks Matt, looking promising!", "created_at": "2018-12-04 14:20:35.881030", "updated_at": "2018-12-04 14:20:35.881030", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 8, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 7.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [49161], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 78543, "user_id": 5667, "topic_id": 13757, "post_number": 13, "raw": "I'm in this room - https://now.edgeryders.eu/room/team for the meeting now.", "created_at": "2020-06-09 08:00:27.039691", "updated_at": "2020-06-09 08:00:27.039691", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 15, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 6.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [78491], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 80622, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 14079, "post_number": 7, "raw": "Send a private message through the same platform: \n\n![image|441x202](upload://bbMX5i1Bp27uxR4TQ8jpXsbvTG4.png)", "created_at": "2020-07-16 10:55:33.271822", "updated_at": "2020-07-16 10:55:33.271822", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 13, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 6.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [80620], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18131, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 1884, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Do opportunities exist if you are not aware?</b>\n\nI think this is an interesting question.

I think the idea is very useful for the general public, and can definitely work, as demonstrated by BlaBlaCar. While BlaBlaCar is for planned rides between cities, maybe this is rather for spontaneous rides over short distances inside Cairo and other metro areas? In that case, [Carpool Kathmandu](http://carpoolkathmandu.com/) for cars and [Tootle](https://tootle.today/) for motorcycle and scooters are examples I know from the Kathmandu metropolitan area in Nepal.\n\nBut platform building is hard. What can jumpstart platforms like this though is a decent crisis. In Nepal it was the fuel blockade in winter 2015/16 at the Indian border that made people look for and organize ride-sharing initiatives.\n\nAlso, if you don't have them yet, look for investors. This is an investable idea for sure, and investments make the required marketing activity of platform building much more feasible. BlaBlaCar [got over 300 million USD](https://www.indexventures.com/news-room/news/blablacar-raises-200-million-to-meet-global-demand-for-ridesharing) in funding \u2026 which is crazy for European standards.\n\nSome tech related ideas:\n\n* There could be the unintended side effect of drivers using their car as an informal taxi service. Nothing to worry in the initial stages, but once it becomes a thing, this would rather contribute to traffic congestion than solve it, as it replaces buses. You have a simple way to solve this, though: prevent drivers from offering more than a certain amount of kilometers a week in rides. Drivers can't create two accounts to work around that, since you already verify driver licences.\n\n* Excluding commercial \"Uber style\" transportation offers completely is also not the best, though. Small buses for \u22658 people make sense on routes not served by \"regular\" public transit. These drivers could get a special \"commercial\" account without the kilometer limit, and you could charge them different fees.\n\n* Could be interesting to offer multi-hop rides with different drivers for people who can't find a \"direct connection\".
