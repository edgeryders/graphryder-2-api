He told me how he preferred prison, because at least in prison you got a release date. He told me about the electric shock therapy, which left your mind totally scrambled for two or three days, then left you feeling more or less ok for two or three days but with no memory, after which they did it all over again. He told me about being chained to four big guys who were there to 'look after him', even when he went to the toilet. About how if he didn't go along with something that they wanted him to do, sooner or later he'd get held down and recieve a knock-out shot delivered to his buttock, which resulted in unconsciousness and a noticeable reduction in his ability to stand up for his rights. Essentially, he didn't have any rights. He was mad. They could do whatever they wanted to him. The detail that most appealed to my Kafkaesque understanding of faceless institutions, was that the refusal to accept that he was mad was taken as evidence that he was still mad. Refusing to take the pills that made him heavy and slow and stupid was seen as proof that his sanity had still not returned. Now you just try to imagine regaining your mental balance under this kind of perverse authority. They say what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, but I'm not so sure I believe them. Dave's approach was to break out of the place and find himself a squat to live in with a couple of mates and several total strangers, one of whom had been recognised by Kieron from a free party, when they bumped into each other down at the job centre. Its amazing what gets hatched down at the job centre, and I'm not talking about anyone finding a job. But anyway, when we turned up at the squat, Dave was living on the sofa in the lounge in a haze of ashtray cigarettes and cheap cider, eyeing the curtains nervously and never far away from a large knife. You got the feeling he was pretty keen never to go back inside that place if there was anything he had to say about it. And he wasn't leaving the house, or even that room much at this time. Absconders from mental health institutions tend to be automatically served with arrest warrants by the local magistrates, and I don't suppose that was helping his mental health any either. Dave seemed to be doing pretty well as far as I could see, considering everything that he'd gone through so far in his life. He told me his Dad was always drunk and often violent. He said his mother had been killed, shot by a farmer standing in front of her dog trying to protect him while out for a walk. That was when he left home. He'd had a job as the look-out for a gang of thieves that robbed industrial units at the age of nine. A little later he'd gone to live with a family of Irish travellers who'd trained him to be a bareknuckle boxer, a discipline at which he was apparently quite talented. Some time after that he'd bought a house, back when they gave mortgages to people with no job, no credit rating and no intention whatsoever to make even a single repayment. That episode lasted a few months, during which time he acquired an addiction to crack and heroin, or 'brown n white' as it was known on the estate. That was when the mental health issues really kicked in. I could sometimes see the different personalities fighting for control inside Dave's head. So much suffering just couldn't be contained inside one self-image, so the ever resourceful ego just created a couple of others to help take the strain. I think it was fair to say that Dave was feeling the pressure. And of course, he couldn't go to get any medication, because he knew the Doctor would just arrange to have him arrested as soon as he arrived at his appointment. \n\u00a0\nOn the one hand, Kieron and Billy were quite happy to have Dave and his knives living on the sofa. After all, this was a squat, and you never know what might go down. Sometimes you have to defend a place, and while Kieron liked his drill, that was about the limit of his handiness. And if anything serious went off you'd most likely find Billy in a cupboard. So Dave had his uses. And anyway, they were mates. But in this condition, he wasn't exactly easy company. So naturally, Billy and Kieron started to pal up a little. They shared a floor in the house with a kitchen in it, they went outside from time to time. They liked to get stoned together, and have a laugh. But this was unsettling to Dave somehow. He'd been mates with Billy for years, since the time he bought the house. He had no family left, no real friends after all the alcoholism, the drugs, the crime, and the madness. Billy was about all he had. And now he was feeling him drifting away. It all came to a head one full moon. It 'd been building for a while. You could feel it all through the house, under the neon strip lights in the corridors. Tension. The more Dave got wound up, the more Kieron and Billy retreated into their little flat. Sometimes you could hear him shouting incoherently in the lounge on his own. It wasn't very reassuring. But on this particular night, we found him shouting slightly more coherently, and it wasn't at himself. It was directed at Kieron. Dave was pacing the lounge, muttering to himself, wild-eyed. Then suddenly, something snapped. He grabbed his largest knife from under the cushions of the sofa and stormed out in the direction of the stairs. Larissa, sharp as ever, phoned Kieron fast and told him to lock his door. She was just in time. \n\u00a0\n'Yer fuckin big gay bastard! Open t'door.' \n\u00a0\n'Fuck off Dave' said Kieron, with his foot set hard against the door to keep his demented friend from getting in. \n\u00a0\nIt wasn't looking good. Dave was stabbing the door repeatedly with his enormous blade, while Kieron, who fortunately for him liked to eat a hearty meal, was leaning against it with all his weight. \n\u00a0\n'Open t'door or I'll fookin kill yer both'\n\u00a0\nIf I open t'door, that's when you'll fookin kill us both, was more what it looked like. \n\u00a0\nThe rest of us were gathering downstairs in the lounge. We'd known these people a week, and this was the only place we had to live. We were not ecstatic about the situation. And besides, we were worried, as much for Dave as for Kieron and Billy. We really liked Dave. He was a lovely lad, underneath all the addictive behaviour, the paranoia and the threat of imminent violence. I'd had a good connection with him from the start. We both had Irish ancestry. We shared a dark sense of humour. Dave's kind of funny was to make unbelievably hot curries, knowing that Billy didn't like them, but that he had no money and that there was no other food in the house. And then to watch Billy eating them, as his face got redder and redder, and his expressions grew ever more absurd. That was like Dave's perfect joke. So anyway, I headed up the stairs, with Dom close behind. The stairwell was pulsating, neon, harsh light. Nowhere to hide. Kieron's door was closed now, with the giant knife stuck in it, wobbling, and Dave half-shouting half-sobbing, desperately scared of losing his friend, his mind, his freedom. I wondered about his family history, and how much comprehension he had of his own emotional reality. It can't have been easy for him. And I thought about my own safety. But however erratic he'd been acting, I didn't feel any kind of malicious intent would be directed towards me.\n\u00a0\n'Dave, Dave. Dave man, it's me.'\n\u00a0\nDave was in his own world, and it was breaking down.\n\u00a0\n'Dave, what's up man? Why don't you put the knife down?'\n\u00a0\nHe kicked the door a couple of times, just desperate now, more than dangerous. My heart broke for him.\n\u00a0\n'Dave, you're bleeding mate! Look. Let me see that hand.'\n\u00a0\nDave looked at his palm, which had been cut by the knife as he had rammed it repeatedly into the door. It wasn't serious, but it was badly enough to make a fair mess. The sight of his own blood seemed to bring him back to himself. All the fight had gone out of him now. You could see he was ready to be taken care of.\n\u00a0\n'You should get that seen to Dave. You want me to come with you mate, we'll go down to the A&E dept at the bottom of the road?'\n\u00a0\nHe let me lead him away, still staring at his bloody palm, and I placed my arm around his shoulders as Dom discretely removed the knife from the door and hid it out of sight. The crisis it seemed, was over. At least for now. But still, we had an evidently pretty broken human being on our hands, and what the hell were we going to do about that?", "created_at": "2017-01-22 19:18:23", "updated_at": "2017-01-22 19:18:23", "tag_id": 1446, "post_id": 502, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 469}, {"id": 10040, "text": null, "quote": "What a story, @Timothy_Daly.

The Malagasy people seem to have lost the desire to resist standing up to defend their rights, even though they are being trampled on a daily basis. According to statistics, 92% of Malagasy lived below the poverty threshold but no one rose up. When social pressure is too much, the point of rupture is not far, and the accumulation of frustration and deprivation often results in bloody explosions. However, this can be avoided. Just put yourself to nonviolent civil resistance! Nowadays, the Malagasy people are tired of going down to the streets to claim their rights as citizens. Why make the strike if it is to have each time the same scenario: Teaser bombs, lost bullets and blood flowing, as was the case in 1972, 2002, or in 2009? Why manifesting because it is the politicians who benefit in the end? Today, people prefer to stay at home and rant about the social network instead of expressing their frustration in public and questioning their leaders. And yet, it is not the subjects of contestation which are wanting. Traffics of all kinds, corruption, bad governance, lack of accountability of elected officials, non-respect of laws, hamper development of the country. It is now essential that the Malagasy rediscover that power belongs to them and that they learn how to fight against injustice, without dilatory maneuvering of the politicians, and without violence. As Martin Luther King Jr pointed out, active nonviolence is not a method for cowards. On the contrary, it is a real resistance. It is the art of using non-violent power to achieve sociopolitical objectives, especially through symbolic protests. This practice was popularized from 1921 by exemplary personalities like Gandhi in India, by Nelson Mandela and Steve Biko in South Africa, or Martin Luther King Jr in his fight against segregation. The Malagasy also experimented with nonviolent civil resistance, for example through publications in satirical journals under colonization, but the practice gradually lost face to the rise of the military and police repression, but Also facing the weariness of the main concerned - the citizens. Contemporary movements such as Wake-up Madagascar are now trying to awaken citizens' consciences and to revive non-violent civil resistance. Short-lived symbolic actions that do not create crowds and are therefore not illegal are regularly organized to denounce the fact of society that make jasper. Expose empty plates to say that the Malagasy are hungry, to walk in the streets of Antananarivo to demand the ratification of a charter on democracy or to make the dead on the place of independence in the city center of the capital to denounce the words which undermine the country are for example, part of the non-violent civil resistance. It is precisely to spread this philosophy on the desire for change through non-violent actions that many projects such as LIANA or Learning Initiative Aiming at Non Violent Action which was initiated by Wake Up Madagascar, Liberty 32 and the WYLD program Women and Youth's League for Democracy with the support of the International Center for Non-Violent Conflict. Since the 70's during the 1st Republic in Madagascar, Malagasy people have been manipulate and influenced by politicians who wants a place on government by force.

The absence of funds is making living in remote Greek islands extremely precarious if you happen to have an accident or life threatening illness. This process of conquest and colonisation by (relatively) faceless forces is no different than the earlier incarnations of colonialism whether we look at the spread of the East India Company or the colonisation of Egypt by the UK in the second half of the 19th century. The major difference today is the rather impressive propaganda whereby people are given the impression that \"there is no alternative\" (TINA). There always are alternatives at every stage in the unfolding of a war. The leader of Greece's SARIZA party, Tsipras, understands this when he says the conflict is between capital and people, and in the same breath states that it is not inevitable that Greece either imposes an austerity package or is kicked out of the Eurozone.

Three things to remember: First, nations have renationalised their resources frequently and often without serious negative consequences to their economic position (cf. Argentina renationalising its oil company, or Bolivia's Morales nationalising the natural gas reserves). Capital screams, everyone is upset, and then they move on.

With Luca, Jacopo and Alice we started\u00a0Dynamoscopio\u00a0(\"those who observe change\"). We are a strange mix of designers, researchers, and practitioners of urban transformation. We are anthropologists, architects, economists.\nIn 2012 we got interested in a neighborhood called Giambellino-Lorenteggio, in Milan. It was undergoing change, and a tension ran through it. Its eastern end is a heavily hipsterized area, with lofts and cool parties connected with the mighty\u00a0Furniture Fair. To the west there are large industrial settlements (Vodafone Italia, for example). Line 4 of the Metro is under construction here. The value of real estate is going up, or soon will. But the neighborhood itself remains low-income, home to many marginalized people. 25,000 people here qualify for subsidized-rent accommodation. Many of them can survive only because they do live in subsidized housing. Many more would have a right to, but the city does not have enough apartments available. So they are stuck in a queue.\nThe neighborhood was (and still is) vulnerable to gentrification. It only takes a small increase in rents to price many people out of the neighborhood. We took a political stance that people should not be driven out, and moved in.\nFirst we investigated the area, and put our findings into a documentary film (trailer). As we did so, we fell in love with the local market,\u00a0Mercato Lorenteggio\u00a0(henceforth ML). This market had a problem: in 2005 a large supermarket had moved into the area. Its competition was driving many local shops out of business \u2013 including several of those in ML. It was clear that the market was on its way out.\nBy then, we had figured out that the neighborhood lacked resilience. Nonlocal Milanese never go there, and why would they? And even the locals do not form the thick web of social relationships you find in a healthy community. We knew one thing: working in Lorenteggio meant spending most of our time dragging people out of their apartments.\nWe tried to draw a sort of map of desires and problems surrounding the market. We mapped the social actors around it: the local people, the municipality, the nonlocal Milanese, the shopkeepers. The shopkeepers seemed the most promising agent of change. They are local businesspeople: if the neighborhood does well, they do well. ML itself could serve as a focal point. If we could revive it, we could show the local community that it can work its way out of a bad situation.\nSo we did several things.\n\n\nWith the shopkeepers, we redefined ML's unique value proposition. The supermarket would always beat us on price, and on opening hours. So we invented a brand we call DOP, Denominazione di Origine Popolare (People's Designation of Origin). This means local products \u2013 Milano is a farming city, with many farms to the immediate south of the city. It also mean \"new local\" products, for example we sell\u00a0teff\u00a0used in Eritrean and Ethiopian cuisine.\n \n\nWe made it clear that these businesses are the natural allies of the neighborhood. For example, we have solidarity campaigns. One is called \"Fai la spesa per la tua scuola\" (shop for your school). Shopkeepers donate part of their income to the local elementary school. Other local partners expressed interest in participating.\n \n\nWe mobilized the community on restoring the fa\u00e7ade of the ML building. A Milan-based company donated the materials; the local people contributed manpower. Physical work on the space creates ownership and mobilization. Also, it was a great party (timelapse video)!\n \n\nWe pushed the mixed use of ML as a place for culture and socializing as well as commerce. For example, we organize courses of Arabic languages (requested by many migrant families), knitting events, etc. The market has wide corridors, and can host up to 1,000 people.\n \n\nWe moved in ourselves. Dynamoscopio runs a tiny cultural space (20 square meters) inside ML. We offer wi-fi too.\n \n\nIn general, we are trying to reinvent the physical space of ML and the kind of local commerce that it offers.\nWho pays for this? We started out with grants. Milan is home to several charitable foundations, and some of them focus on the poorer neighborhoods. With time, we are moving towards a more sustainable mix of revenue streams. Even the shopkeepers, now, are chipping in: this is great, because it a sign of increased sustainability. Also, the work we do in Lorenteggio is good PR, and it helps Dynamoscopio get clients.\nWe think we are carers, in a way. We care for the community as a whole, rather than for any one person in it. \"Taking care\" in this context means keeping ML open and thriving; and that, in turn, means contributing to them getting income. The shops in ML are holding the line of the viability of the whole community.\nWe are not open by default, but we do use some of the strategies of the open source movement. Example: some migrant families from Arabophone countries wanted courses of Arabic for the children. We helped them set them up, and set them up in the market. The logic is this: if the market becomes an open platform for people to do stuff, more people will go there. This will create more business opportunities for the shops: you went for the Arabic lesson, it makes sense to do your groceries there too.\nConsidering, our work with ML is going rather well. In 2012 it was on its way out, with several shops closed: in 2016 all stalls are in use, and the market is thriving. The space has become more beautiful and welcoming.\nStill, there are many things we would like to improve. For example, last year we organized two \"swap markets\", and they failed badly. Both events were popular, with a lot of people in attendance. But these were people from outside the neighborhood, many of them hipsters. This created tension, because the locals see them as harbingers that they will be priced out of the neighborhood. Another pain point is that we are unable to monitor our impact. Shopkeepers are reluctant to disclose how much money they are making. We do not even have a system to count the number of people present in the market. We would love to have some kind of tool, but somehow this sort of work always gets deprioritized, there is so much to do.\nAlso, we are not sure how much longer we can afford to stay engaged with ML. But we worry. What happens when we stop pushing? Another example: for a while, a guy named Manuel ran a vegetable garden outside ML. People loved it. But when Manuel withdrew, the whole thing dried out. These dynamics look great, but they are not always sustainable.\nDo you know of any similar experience? We would love to compare notes.", "created_at": "2017-01-10 17:25:16", "updated_at": "2017-01-10 17:25:16", "tag_id": 1395, "post_id": 804, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 771}, {"id": 10118, "text": null, "quote": "We face two main challenges.

Thanks for your feedbacks. In 2014, we started with the positive expiratory pressure therapy for CF children. It was in fact not the best move as the exercice takes about 30 minutes daily, which would require a lot of resources to have interesting games, plus the fact that the exercice is quite strict, so challenging to make it interesting. We then thought about other, more free gameplays, which we have to develop. We are now working on mini-games for asthma, that are about triggers and how to take the medicine. We want to reuse the work done for CF to build short games for aerosoltherapy.\nRegarding tests, we did a prestudy with ten children in a hospital, to see their interest, and that was positive. We are preparing two studies with focus groups to test the games that have been improved.\nMany learnings were also about setting the collaboratife framework, platform, etc. We are writing a few articles about that, that should be released in the next month. The initiative mostly advances during events as our community is always small, but we start to have funding and are going to redistribute them, with the aim to mobilize contributors on the long run. One big challenge is also that our non-exclusive model is not easily understood by authorities, so it takes a lot of time to explain it, and many fundings are not available as most competitions support profit-driven organizations. So we are thinking about creating a specific structure to be able to access these resources. Another thing is to move from proprietary to free softwares, for example from Google docs to a wiki, or from Unity game engine to another one. So they are lots of interesing challenges at different levels.

With Luca, Jacopo and Alice we started\u00a0Dynamoscopio\u00a0(\"those who observe change\"). We are a strange mix of designers, researchers, and practitioners of urban transformation. We are anthropologists, architects, economists.\nIn 2012 we got interested in a neighborhood called Giambellino-Lorenteggio, in Milan. It was undergoing change, and a tension ran through it. Its eastern end is a heavily hipsterized area, with lofts and cool parties connected with the mighty\u00a0Furniture Fair. To the west there are large industrial settlements (Vodafone Italia, for example). Line 4 of the Metro is under construction here. The value of real estate is going up, or soon will. But the neighborhood itself remains low-income, home to many marginalized people. 25,000 people here qualify for subsidized-rent accommodation. Many of them can survive only because they do live in subsidized housing. Many more would have a right to, but the city does not have enough apartments available. So they are stuck in a queue.\nThe neighborhood was (and still is) vulnerable to gentrification. It only takes a small increase in rents to price many people out of the neighborhood. We took a political stance that people should not be driven out, and moved in.\nFirst we investigated the area, and put our findings into a documentary film (trailer). As we did so, we fell in love with the local market,\u00a0Mercato Lorenteggio\u00a0(henceforth ML). This market had a problem: in 2005 a large supermarket had moved into the area. Its competition was driving many local shops out of business \u2013 including several of those in ML. It was clear that the market was on its way out.\nBy then, we had figured out that the neighborhood lacked resilience. Nonlocal Milanese never go there, and why would they? And even the locals do not form the thick web of social relationships you find in a healthy community. We knew one thing: working in Lorenteggio meant spending most of our time dragging people out of their apartments.\nWe tried to draw a sort of map of desires and problems surrounding the market. We mapped the social actors around it: the local people, the municipality, the nonlocal Milanese, the shopkeepers. The shopkeepers seemed the most promising agent of change. They are local businesspeople: if the neighborhood does well, they do well. ML itself could serve as a focal point. If we could revive it, we could show the local community that it can work its way out of a bad situation.\nSo we did several things.\n\n\nWith the shopkeepers, we redefined ML's unique value proposition. The supermarket would always beat us on price, and on opening hours. So we invented a brand we call DOP, Denominazione di Origine Popolare (People's Designation of Origin). This means local products \u2013 Milano is a farming city, with many farms to the immediate south of the city. It also mean \"new local\" products, for example we sell\u00a0teff\u00a0used in Eritrean and Ethiopian cuisine.\n \n\nWe made it clear that these businesses are the natural allies of the neighborhood. For example, we have solidarity campaigns. One is called \"Fai la spesa per la tua scuola\" (shop for your school). Shopkeepers donate part of their income to the local elementary school. Other local partners expressed interest in participating.\n \n\nWe mobilized the community on restoring the fa\u00e7ade of the ML building. A Milan-based company donated the materials; the local people contributed manpower. Physical work on the space creates ownership and mobilization. Also, it was a great party (timelapse video)!\n \n\nWe pushed the mixed use of ML as a place for culture and socializing as well as commerce. For example, we organize courses of Arabic languages (requested by many migrant families), knitting events, etc. The market has wide corridors, and can host up to 1,000 people.\n \n\nWe moved in ourselves. Dynamoscopio runs a tiny cultural space (20 square meters) inside ML. We offer wi-fi too.\n \n\nIn general, we are trying to reinvent the physical space of ML and the kind of local commerce that it offers.\nWho pays for this? We started out with grants. Milan is home to several charitable foundations, and some of them focus on the poorer neighborhoods. With time, we are moving towards a more sustainable mix of revenue streams. Even the shopkeepers, now, are chipping in: this is great, because it a sign of increased sustainability. Also, the work we do in Lorenteggio is good PR, and it helps Dynamoscopio get clients.\nWe think we are carers, in a way. We care for the community as a whole, rather than for any one person in it. \"Taking care\" in this context means keeping ML open and thriving; and that, in turn, means contributing to them getting income. The shops in ML are holding the line of the viability of the whole community.\nWe are not open by default, but we do use some of the strategies of the open source movement. Example: some migrant families from Arabophone countries wanted courses of Arabic for the children. We helped them set them up, and set them up in the market. The logic is this: if the market becomes an open platform for people to do stuff, more people will go there. This will create more business opportunities for the shops: you went for the Arabic lesson, it makes sense to do your groceries there too.\nConsidering, our work with ML is going rather well. In 2012 it was on its way out, with several shops closed: in 2016 all stalls are in use, and the market is thriving. The space has become more beautiful and welcoming.\nStill, there are many things we would like to improve. For example, last year we organized two \"swap markets\", and they failed badly. Both events were popular, with a lot of people in attendance. But these were people from outside the neighborhood, many of them hipsters. This created tension, because the locals see them as harbingers that they will be priced out of the neighborhood. Another pain point is that we are unable to monitor our impact. Shopkeepers are reluctant to disclose how much money they are making. We do not even have a system to count the number of people present in the market. We would love to have some kind of tool, but somehow this sort of work always gets deprioritized, there is so much to do.\nAlso, we are not sure how much longer we can afford to stay engaged with ML. But we worry. What happens when we stop pushing? Another example: for a while, a guy named Manuel ran a vegetable garden outside ML. People loved it. But when Manuel withdrew, the whole thing dried out. These dynamics look great, but they are not always sustainable.\nDo you know of any similar experience? We would love to compare notes.", "created_at": "2017-01-10 17:25:28", "updated_at": "2017-01-10 17:25:28", "tag_id": 1461, "post_id": 804, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 771}, {"id": 10143, "text": null, "quote": "We believe in the utter necessity of revolution, of the development of material lines of power.

That project outlined the history and present conditions of the Scajaquada River. The river was buried under the city of Buffalo in the 1800\u2019s as a way to keep from dealing with the smell and pollution found in the water. Parts of the river remain buried and it continues to be polluted even as it is monitored by state and federal organizations.\u00a0 My research and installation took about three years to put together, and it presented the complexity of how economy, government policies, lack of planning, lack of accessible information and climate change can dramatically erode an environmental and cultural asset. \nIt was during this installation that I was approached to consider doing a similar project about the Bagmati River that flows though the middle of Kathmandu, Nepal. I was excited about extending my body of work beyond the Western Hemisphere and to working with a culturally diverse community. After initial discussions with professionals, museum staff and community members in Kathmandu, it was clear that there was a great deal of interest in me starting a new project investigating the Bagmati River. I was granted a residency at the Kathmandu Contemporary Arts Center a few months later, and my research began in earnest. Jason Dilworth joined the venture early in 2016 and his work has been integral to the project\u2019s success. During Jason\u2019s and my first trip to Kathmandu in March of 2016, we were able to strengthen past connections to the project while building a larger network of individuals and groups committed to improving conditions in the Kathmandu Valley and the communities outside the valley who live along the river. Support for the Bagmati River Arts Project has grown steadily from the beginning through the assistance of Hatchfund donors, travel support through SUNY Fredonia and a Burchfield Penney Art Center grant. It has continued to grow through the sales of the project\u2019s publications and the sales of my artwork. \nThe Bagmati River Arts Project\u00a0includes:\nA. an exhibition at the Siddhartha Art Gallery at Barbar Mahal Revisited in Kathmandu opening on November 20th, 2016. My artwork, water data from the Bagmati River and the video documentary will be presented on the second floor. The first will include artwork by Nepalese artists whose attention focuses with issues related to the Bagmati River. We are also working with the fine art faculty and students at Kathmandu University who will be creating work related to their cultural connections to the river.\nB. a book is being published (available in November 2016) that documents the importance of the Bagmati River, the cause for the pollution, climate change effects on the Kathmandu Valley and its groundwater, and plans to improve the condition of the river. The role of this publication, like the exhibition, is to use aesthetics as a way to make the scientific data accessible to a wider audience. Artists from the United States and Nepal will be included in the publication. The publication will be made available in Kathmandu at no cost to the residents to assure wide dissemination of its data to a diverse communities. It also will be available in the United States and sold as a way to fund other parts of this project and future projects. A link to this finished book is available on this website.\nC. a documentary video will document the project and include interviews with water quality and health professionals, community members as well a policy maker in Kathmandu. Songs by traditional Nepalese folk singers are incorporated throughout the video including a commissioned song about the Bagmati River. A link to this finished documentary is available on this website.\nD. a brochure and poster written in Nepalese will also provide important accessible scientific and health data about the river. The poster and brochures will be distributed to the communities that live along the entire length of the river in Nepal. Members of the Bagmati River Expedition 2015 team, who created a comprehensive report about the river\u2019s water quality, microinvertebrates, avian population and plastics data, have already established connections in these communities. We are working with Sujan Chitrakar and his graphic design students in designing the posters and brochures. Sujan is the Academic Program Coordinator and an Assistant Professor for Kathmandu University\u2019s School of Art, Center for Art and Design.\nAll elements of the project listed above will be finished and presented at the opening of the exhibition in November 20, 2016 when Jason and I plan to return to Kathmandu.\nAn exciting extension to this project is the plan to ship the artwork, publication, documentary, brochures and posters back to the United States where it will tour around the country and, possibly, internationally. Water issues are a worldwide concern and the Bagmati\u2019s perils are not unique. Our hope is that, by touring the exhibition and by combining it with site-specific exhibitions, audiences can create connections between their region and other global communities. There is a good deal that can be learned from the history of the Bagmati as well as from the grass roots efforts that created the Saturday Bagmati River clean-up program and the successful community health initiatives supported by the non-government organizations. All of these efforts has unified the underserved residents of the Kathmandu Valley to address the basic needs in their communities while creating hope and motivating government involvement.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Burchfield Penney Art Center in Buffalo, New York is very interested in the merits of the project and they have volunteered to promote and organize the touring exhibition.\nFor more information please contact alberto@albertorey.com.", "created_at": "2017-01-06 19:38:06", "updated_at": "2017-01-06 19:38:06", "tag_id": 1474, "post_id": 752, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 719}, {"id": 10160, "text": null, "quote": "And @albertorey , about your initiative: the arts may indeed prove to be a key to get collective organizing going for river protection and cleanup.

So back in July, a friend from Mumbai was looking for ways to catch the garbage while it's carried in the river and before it reaches the shore, and together we found this barrier boom technology, produced locally in India by a company from Bangalore.

There is a great reason for us to team up and work on the challenge together: Hacking, internet security, and medical devices.

This means she has to implicitly trust the programmers, and despite her and Eireann\u2019s years of assessing devices for security holes, they wouldn\u2019t normally be \u201callowed\u201d to investigate the security of such devices.\nThis implies how little a regular customer of similar devices is informed about the ways they work, what protocols and tools they use, where their data is stored, etc. It has everything to do with person's safety - and still, companies keep most of the key information secret from the users, making them more vulnerable.\nI suggest you watch this great video from 32C3, where Marie and \u00c9ireann tell about their journey.\nObviously, the issue of safety transcends this case and applies to a whole range of tools that increasingly improve our quality of life and longevity. The security flaws are potentially causing exactly the opposite, making for a health/life hazard. There are concerns about privacy too, where your medical data flows around the world to companies that may or may not be taking measures to protect it.\nBut that's not all - \u00c9ireann works also as an advisor for European Network for Cyber Security (ENISA), has founded http://www.concinnity-risks.com/, and works as a Senior Risk Researcher at Cambridge Centre for Risk Studies.

He's also offering insight into vulnerability research and standards-based research, contributing safety and transparency knowledge to this huge, open swarm OPENandChange wants to become.

The costs to the company forces developers to do their very best (in theory). Yes, it's not open source to the regular customer, but what would it serve?. Afterall it takes an expert to understand. Regulations are born to protect the consumer, but they are resource expensive meaning that devices become excessively expensive in confrontation with production price.

Also there is the issue of possibly not being able to support the current complexity of the domain in the longer term.\nLastly, I think work in the techno-medical-regulatory domain may help overcome indifference towards the consequences of technological choices, as illustrated in Alberto's comment.", "created_at": "2017-01-27 19:13:51", "updated_at": "2017-01-27 19:13:51", "tag_id": 1483, "post_id": 21955, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 679}, {"id": 10201, "text": null, "quote": "First off, let me apologise for the long delay. I have been truly buried in work, and my life got heavily disrupted by personal matters for a couple months.\n@Rune\nI think we have some miscommunication here. I'm not suggesting open source is more reliable, or the only way to go with medical devices. However, there is an issue of transparency of the code to the patient, that has 'similar' issues to the issues of open source.\nOn your other points though, you rightly note that there is a lot of safety and regulation around medical devices. However, we still know that user input issues pervade the safety of medical devices. For examples, see the paper Preventing Medication Errors by \u00a0P Aspden, J Wolcott, J L Bootman, L R Cronenwett:, or any of a number of papers by Harold Thimbleby. The paper Killed by Code written by Sandler et al, also details many case studies that you might be interested in. Getting back to the point about safety regulation, I don't believe that safety regulation takes security into account as regularly. This istarting to happen, but very slowly. This is why the paper \"Pacemakers and implantable cardiac defibrillators: Software radio attacks and zero-power defenses\" is so powerful. They took an FDA certified device, and showed it was possible to make it operate unsafely after some security analysis.\nThere are many more things we might discuss about regulation, such as the FDA's limited resources for looking at the code of the devices. However, there are some good things too, such as the MAUDE database. http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfMAUDE/search.CFM\nBy making this database available, we can search for adverse events and study this in an evidence based approach, as you rightly request.

If one cannot bring a simple solution to the market because of the iters for safety and quality certification, and this we agree is bad, the solution should not be \"ok, let's ignore this step and bypass it\".\nThere are a number of issues here. 1st and foremost, one has to describe how safety and quality are reasonably assured, and what safety net would be put in place should something still happen (although we know they are not perfect, to use an euphemism, today a number of tools and services exist to cover for assistance, accidents' costs, etc on the side of providers).\nOf course, one could ignore this. Depending on the IP scheme, no safety nets would be needed (although it would nice to think of them), for example. But this brings us to a second issue, one that\u00a0is almost\u00a0\"ethical\": transforming every patient in a maker can leverage the citizen-scientist effect only if (this is presented as\u00a0gut feeling here, but I am open to discuss it in depth later)\u00a0the right IP scheme is adopted. And only if radical openness is adopted one can truly claim no responsibility over the final \"accidents\" that will always happen (only that which does not work, will not break).\u00a0Should the creator preserve control of the IP for itself, one will always find a court that will consider the business model \"exploitative\", and enforce the order to establish the aforementioned safety nets (there is an interesting case about a fire happend in an AirBnB apartment that touches on this topic)... falling back to the problem one wanted to work around, just a bit later.\nSo, what would be the general ecosystem' services that would keep this garden grow orderly? I don't see this answered (that's not an easy one,\u00a0indeed)\nResearch, and \"citizen science\", target the pioneers and early adopters...

Let's be honest with ourselves and remember that researchers are very optimistic people (I belong to the category, so this is self-criticism). They will produce proof of concepts, hardly ever demonstrators (although they usually confuse the terminology), and they don't normally ask themselves questions like \"how long will this work continuously?\", \"what will be the safety mechanism once it turns off, as instance because of battery exhaustion?\", how many scenarios are realistically recapitulated in the lab I used for the tests, and how well does this solution generalize?\",...\nLet's not dive in the argument of healthcare provision on this topic. Sometimes it is the right reflection to face, some other it is populistic...

When ever an adolescent brings up a topic around \u00a0reproductive health or sex \u00a0education, they are usually severely punished \u00a0and regarded as been disrespectful to their elders. Due to this absence of discussion on sex education, many adolescent young girls face lots of challenges and stigma at their puberty stage, especially during menstruation.Most parents in Cameroon especially in the rural and grassroots areas, don't know that they have to provide pads for their girl children during menstruation. They don't even give their girls advice when these children even summon a little courage to inform them that something abnormal is happening with them .According to many parents, these children are very immature and still very young to be able to handle understand and process issues on puberty , reproductive health and menstruation. Because of this lack of discussion between parents and children on sex education, many of these girls, during menstruation are forced to stay away from school because of stigma from boys who often notice blood stains on their uniforms and also the unpleasant odor which \u00a0cames out of the bodies as a result. \u00a0Their staying away from school, makes them not to be performant as they ought to be like the boys and this plays a key role for their poor performances. Some stay away for two weeks and others for a month, just to avoid this stigma. As a youth advocate to encourage parent children dialogue on sex education and advoacting for Access to reproductive health knowledge, i have had time to hold some trainings with a few groups of adolescent girls to tell me about their experiences. \u00a0As a result of lack of menstrual hygiene, due to absence of \u00a0dialogue between them and their parents, \u00a0i was amazed by the stories i got. Some said, as they approached their parents \u00a0when\u00a0they noticed boold stains on their pants, they were thoroughly scolded and driven away and warned never to discuss any thing on menstruation. Some said, they were forced to carry dry dust and sand to\u00a0insert into their vaginas in order to stop the bleeding as they knew not what was happening to them. Other stories came up like using \u00a0dirty clothes to pad themselves, which was very in hygienic and gave them some genital infections. \u00a0As a result of this lack of knowledge on reproductive health for adolescent girls, many have dropped out of school because of unintended pregnancies, some have contracted sexually transmissable infections and others have been forced into early marriages , to the boys that impregnated them. Many of these \u00a0adolecents have lost hope for a better future, because they are now in condtions due to necglect and lack of reproductive health knowledge. \u00a0so i am hoping to enlightened parents and the community about the importance of sex education and also advocating for this curriculum to be taught in primary and secondary schools in Cameroon. I am hoping, to equally train these adolescent girls on matters of gender equality, menstrual hygiene , family planning and reproductive health as a Whole. In Africa, there is an ardage which says \"Charity begins at home\" if \u00a0discussions between parents and children are initiated at home on sex education, it will go an extra mile to enable parents understand their daughters and support them effectively , so that they will not be statistics of unwanted pregnancies , school drop outs and poor academic performance in school. If Access to knowledge on reproductive health is improved upon \u00a0for parents and adolescent girls, then sustainable development will be ensured.

Women do not seek a special status, not seeking privileges.\nWomen \u00a0demand the respect that every human being deserves, looking for the opportunity to be the best version of yourself, achieve talents, looking for an opportunity to live freely, go towards achieving its objectives without fear that they will be attacked, abuse, put down, ridiculed\u2026 crippled\nMany studies have shown the importance of women in large companies and how important it is to have greater participation of women in the labor,\u00a0The whole society has benefits and profit from that, also\u00a0economic empowerment of women can give them the strength and the power to fight for their rights.\u00a0What is I have to emphasis\u00a0totally crazy, to fight for something that is obvious and should be guaranteed.\u00a0But since we live in such a country and such a world, which I will say freely that's gone completely crazy.\nThe first thing we have to teach girls, because some things are taught from childhood, that the slap is not love, that no one have right to beat you, there is no reason to be afraid. You have\u00a0to forget that terrible sentence, you're a girl, you you have to let go, you have to listen, \u00a0you must be good,\u00a0obedient\nWell, \u00a0you do not have to do anything\nBe good and obedient and you'll be good and obedient patients\nIf you're a girl, you do not have to do anything that you do not like, house, kids, kitchen, It is not your job by default, \u00a0you can be scientist, pilot, astroanut, everything you want\nOf course, a question of love, partners, children, number of children, or abortion, should be your choice, initiation of sex and number of partners is also your thing, \u00a0to love, to be loved, free, jealousy is not proof of love, respect and friendship are very important, you have a right to do what you want when you want and not worry about social norms, because only happy persone have good thoughts and \u00a0works good, Society where women are sitting home and deal with the housework is dead. We need all the strengths and capable\u00a0and smart and successful women, because obviously while men are leding,\u00a0we can not talk about peace and prosperity, we should agree to disagree, to respect and appreciate each to give\u00a0positive example because children learn from their parents, scattered on the model, so change must start from family, parents, environment, kindergartens, schools ... this is serious story , a wide and large, but the success is guaranteed if we work together, jointly, it is not enough to have a law that sanctioned violence, because in every segment of society and at every step of women suffer some form of discrimination, some form of abuse, violence, really suffer if they are young and pretty, and if they are ugly and old, have always been the subject of ridicule, gossip, and never good enough and ther is \u00a0always something wrong , they have to be perfect to be loved because they are \u00a0upbringing in that manner, it is a huge burden, that burden must be rejected, it's okay to be imperfect it's okay to have a bad day, to smilie\u00a0and \u00a0to be good...\nIt is a great theme, and very serious and \u00a0requires indispensable\u00a0large and big steps to make the change, so we\u00a0won't\u00a0any more\u00a0read about dark statistics or to be a part of it,\nI forgot about inadequate or not existing\u00a0 health status of women and treating them, how horrible gynecologist acting,\u00a0a large number of cancers that are not detected at time, shame, \u00a0when they\u00a0give birth listen insults and so on...\n\u00a0I want you to understant situation in my country, importance of the problem and that action is needed, that will not be easy, but it is something that must do\u00a0because it is not a choice any more it is our obligation.", "created_at": "2017-06-26 13:34:49", "updated_at": "2017-06-26 13:34:49", "tag_id": 1523, "post_id": 858, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 825}, {"id": 10344, "text": null, "quote": "In Cameroon, parent children discussion on sex education is a taboo. When ever an adolescent brings up a topic around \u00a0reproductive health or sex \u00a0education, they are usually severely punished \u00a0and regarded as been disrespectful to their elders. Due to this absence of discussion on sex education, many adolescent young girls face lots of challenges and stigma at their puberty stage, especially during menstruation.Most parents in Cameroon especially in the rural and grassroots areas, don't know that they have to provide pads for their girl children during menstruation. They don't even give their girls advice when these children even summon a little courage to inform them that something abnormal is happening with them .According to many parents, these children are very immature and still very young to be able to handle understand and process issues on puberty , reproductive health and menstruation. Because of this lack of discussion between parents and children on sex education, many of these girls, during menstruation are forced to stay away from school because of stigma from boys who often notice blood stains on their uniforms and also the unpleasant odor which \u00a0cames out of the bodies as a result. \u00a0Their staying away from school, makes them not to be performant as they ought to be like the boys and this plays a key role for their poor performances. Some stay away for two weeks and others for a month, just to avoid this stigma. As a youth advocate to encourage parent children dialogue on sex education and advoacting for Access to reproductive health knowledge, i have had time to hold some trainings with a few groups of adolescent girls to tell me about their experiences. \u00a0As a result of lack of menstrual hygiene, due to absence of \u00a0dialogue between them and their parents, \u00a0i was amazed by the stories i got. Some said, as they approached their parents \u00a0when\u00a0they noticed boold stains on their pants, they were thoroughly scolded and driven away and warned never to discuss any thing on menstruation. Some said, they were forced to carry dry dust and sand to\u00a0insert into their vaginas in order to stop the bleeding as they knew not what was happening to them. Other stories came up like using \u00a0dirty clothes to pad themselves, which was very in hygienic and gave them some genital infections. \u00a0As a result of this lack of knowledge on reproductive health for adolescent girls, many have dropped out of school because of unintended pregnancies, some have contracted sexually transmissable infections and others have been forced into early marriages , to the boys that impregnated them. Many of these \u00a0adolecents have lost hope for a better future, because they are now in condtions due to necglect and lack of reproductive health knowledge. \u00a0so i am hoping to enlightened parents and the community about the importance of sex education and also advocating for this curriculum to be taught in primary and secondary schools in Cameroon. I am hoping, to equally train these adolescent girls on matters of gender equality, menstrual hygiene , family planning and reproductive health as a Whole. In Africa, there is an ardage which says \"Charity begins at home\" if \u00a0discussions between parents and children are initiated at home on sex education, it will go an extra mile to enable parents understand their daughters and support them effectively , so that they will not be statistics of unwanted pregnancies , school drop outs and poor academic performance in school. If Access to knowledge on reproductive health is improved upon \u00a0for parents and adolescent girls, then sustainable development will be ensured. I believe that women and girls form an essential link in sustainable development.", "created_at": "2017-05-29 22:01:41", "updated_at": "2017-05-29 22:01:41", "tag_id": 1524, "post_id": 849, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 816}, {"id": 10345, "text": null, "quote": "This R&D project considers how an art institution and collection can be held as a shared asset.\nIndependent curator Helen Kaplinsky and artist and director of Islington Mill Maurice Carlin will share their research so far into models for ownership and funding from various industries.

I had never exposed myself or talked about my feelings. As time went by I got better and better at it. A very good listener my friends called me. Even today I still find myself shifting the subject of the conversation whenever it gets to me.\nI tried to act like I was Ok, or maybe I was just not aware. I had an eating disorder and a sleeping disorder and it got pretty bad at some points. Almost every night I'd stay in bed awake waiting\u00a0for my family members to go to sleep, then I'd storm the fridge eating like 4 hungry people, go back to bed feel horrible and couldn't fall asleep.\nI lived like that for many years, sometimes it was better sometimes worst. I can't tell what drove into seeking help but around the age of 22 I told my mother I think I need help. She was very happy that it came from me rather than her as she was thinking the same.\nI started\u00a0going to therapy. It took me nearly 4 months to gain the trust I needed to open my heart but with time my therapist and I became closer and through our conversations I slowly began to understand what my life was missing: love, family and friends. Yeah I've had my loving family, a few friends and a number of short romances but none of it real because I didn't allow it to be, I've never been me.\n4 years later I'm studying industrial design and doing Erasmus in UdK Berlin.\n\nAs part of our human centered design course \"Hacking Utopia\", my partner Pauline and I are focusing on the challenge how we might boost each other's mental and spiritual resilience. After posting here story to Edgeryders, our team member Nele was recommended in a comment to watch Brene Browns Ted talk, The Power of Vulnerability. We have found it so inspiring, it was exactly what we were talking about.\nAt the moment we are trying not to have any idea of how our product will look like so that we can have a neutral research and hopefully a surprising result, but we are looking in the direction of a design intervention that will encourage people to be vulnerable and share their feelings with their loved ones.\n\nBoth Pauline and I went through therapy and we both agree that what was missing in our lives was the ability to share our difficulties with our close ones. We discovered that both of us had to use objects in order to speak to our therapists. I had to put a cushion over my knees and Pauline was always keeping her hands busy by playing with hair bands or ripping pieces of paper, avoiding eye contact.\nWe were wondering whether you might have made any similar interesting experiences/observations to share with. Do you feel comfortable sharing your feeling with others? Can you get people to open up to you?\nWe are trying to gain insight on what kinds of stressors people find difficult to talk about and how we might make it easier for people to overcome shame and share their feelings, drawing inspiration from any culture, any time.\nAlso, if you have any other Ideas, thoughts, articles, projects, products or whatever you think can inspire us further please let us know.\nThank you so much for reading so far,\nTeam JUS.\nP.s. - We really liked this short video and wish we could make a sofa that feels as good as the hug in the picture above.", "created_at": "2017-01-22 22:39:51", "updated_at": "2017-01-22 22:39:51", "tag_id": 1538, "post_id": 678, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 645}, {"id": 14151, "text": "", "quote": "AuxiLife will reduce time and energy consumption to look for the \u201cPersonal Care Assistant\u201d to be with the person with disabilities.", "created_at": "2018-07-31 22:29:01.831533", "updated_at": "2018-07-31 22:29:01.831533", "tag_id": 3179, "post_id": 34574, "creator_id": 4155, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 6764}, {"id": 19804, "text": "", "quote": "Na szczescie przezywamy rozne rzeczy", "created_at": "2020-06-15 11:03:53.323711", "updated_at": "2020-08-31 20:32:43.667214", "tag_id": 5648, "post_id": 60832, "creator_id": 6484, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 10419}, {"id": 10393, "text": null, "quote": "thanks for getting back to me.

Our team is working in the Hacking Utopia project at UDK (University of Arts) in Berlin. We are two product designers and two communication students.\nMain target group are refugees why we mostly talked to young men from syria. Of course they are facing a lot of problems and some are probably more serious tha the one we are trying to solve. We found out that -waiting for german bureaucracy to give them the needed papers and learning german- a lot of them feel lost in their new environment. Although our focus is on refugees Newcomer is for everyone, who is new in the city.\nOur App combines different types of challenges in a city-rally taking place in Berlin. They make them explore the town and talk to people. So for exapmple it asks them to take a photo of something, that reminds them of their origin. Also we are inviting Institutions like Bars, Caf\u00e9s and Eventspaces be a part of our project. So for example we lead a participant to a caf\u00e9 and ask him to drink a coffee with someone. Both drinks are half priced so they get in contact by using this discound. With a growing community different app-users could match and meet to solve tasks together and have a nice experience.\nSo our app definitely is no tourist guide. It is more like a motivation-tool to go out and socialize. In two weeks we are starting a crouwdfunding-campaign on start next. Until then we clarify our concept and test it with people.

We take a health issue like histamine intolerance as a concrete example for which it is clear and mandatory that food intake and lifestyle are determining the severity of the health condition. In defining \u201cCare\u201d I would like to work around the question: Is our diet and lifestyle shaped around products or can we brake out of this path and empower ourselves in designing products - an app in this case - that help us define which food and lifestyle combination is better for each unique person? Can a tool help eventually finding one's way to still eat or drink that food by combining it differently and so on?\n\nNeed or problem you are attempting to solve*\nHow can one learn to listen to her body and track, compare, and be systematic with the help of technology. The idea is to help people to be more in touch with their body rather than alienate from it. How to empower users with a system that guides them in tracking aliments and environmental reactions, observe cross behaviors, and share that information with other users. A guided digital diary can be very helpful in a case like histamine intolerance where the combination of foods, cooking and food preservation, as well as lifestyle, and environmental conditions, all play a great role, in an intricate and complex combination. Histamine intolerance has been chosen as a concrete case to work with because it's a health condition I suffer from myself and for which I would like to have a tool that helps me deal with it. From a developer standpoint it will be a tool that I can test in first person. Next to it, there are more and more friends who have found they are affected by this condition, so it will be as well easy to find a group of people for preliminary usability testing.\n\u200bBeneficiary, single person and/or community*\nBeneficiary will be both single persons and the community in a mutual exchange between users affected by the health condition and those who want to participate and make use of the app like doctors, researchers, practitioners and more.\n\nSolution, brief description of the project*\nA first version of the app will be essentially A GUIDED FOOD DIARY.\nObtain information and make your own list of safe foods, referring to a build-in food list of: high-histamine, anti-histamine, anti-inflammatory and cross- check it with a list of typical symptoms and reactions.\u00a0The idea is to allow users to add #tag foods, behaviors, and symptoms with the intention to generate knowledge and work in the direction of creating a community and use data-analysis for a second version of the app.\u00a0The food diary can help create awareness and be a systematic tool in finding out which foods provoke reactions and to which degree.\u00a0It can help to expand one's diet, follow elimination diet systems, help re-introduce single foods, and monitor whether these provoke any reactions or not. It can help apply more logic to why certain symptoms occur and when. It can be used to help one's general practitioner or specialist in doing more targeted testing. It can be a great support in case of multiple intolerances as well.\n\u200bTechnologies already adopted or that you are planning to adopt*\nWe are a two-women team whit design and development skills.

The aim is to focus on reducing\u00a0the number of inpatients over fifty years of age with entering the hospital with preventable ailments such as heart disease, high cholesterol, dementia, and lung cancer.\u00a0\nThe hospital is based\u00a0in The Liberties in Dublin, which got its name in the 12th century due to its location just outside Dublin City's walls \u2013 lands united with the city, but still keeping their own jurisdiction (hence \"liberties\"). The area's history is still very relevant to the health of its residents.\nBeing outside the city walls, the Liberties became a hub for trade and craftsmen. The 19th century saw the Liberties become dominated by large brewing and distilling families, most notably Guinness who built the world's largest brewery there. With this industrial wealth, however, came dire poverty and slum living conditions. Today the Liberties\u00a0is a city neighbourhood of opportunities and innovation, but its history -\u00a0positive and negative -\u00a0pervades. Although having undergone much urban regeneration as well as gentrification,\u00a0the Liberties still embodies that juncture between being a centre for enterprise and commercial life as well as being home to large blocks of inner city social housing. Homelessness, drug use, and lower than average life expectancy are some of the problems facing\u00a0in the Liberties today.\u00a0\nOn researching in the area first-hand, it was observed that there was a distinct lack of male presence in local community centres, as well as a high number of men drinking alone in pubs. The Liberties Local Health project draws on this observation to engage those lone drinkers to become members of a local brewing club, where beer is brewed by locals, for locals.\nThe\u00a0project takes its inspiration from the highly successful Men\u2019s Sheds mental health initiative whose\u00a0motto is, \u201cmen don\u2019t talk face to face, they talk shoulder to shoulder.\u201d\nHOW?\nThe\u00a0brewing club for men over fifty\u00a0in the locality \u2013 where they create a low percentage beer brewed by locals,\u00a0for locals \u2013\u00a0harnesses existing local\u00a0skill sets of the hundreds of Guinness factory retirees.\nThe brewing club, \"Sl\u00e1inte\", takes it name from the Irish word for \"cheers\", also meaning \"health\". The aim of the club is to\u00a0encourage\u00a0more responsible drinking through\u00a0appreciation of the brewing process\u00a0as well as forming a sense of pride and comradery among members. The project was commended by health industry professionals after its presentation at Dublin\u2019s Active Age Conference 2012.\nWith Ireland's craft beer market having hit\u00a0\u20ac59 million in 2016 (up form \u20ac40 million in 2015) and volumes of beer from Irish microbreweries having increased by 415% between 2011 and 2015, the brewing club \"Sl\u00e1inte\" has high viability potential to run itself as a social enterprise overseen by members, bringing with it a sense of pride, achievement, and overall better health.", "created_at": "2017-05-22 18:35:03", "updated_at": "2017-05-22 18:35:03", "tag_id": 1572, "post_id": 841, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 808}, {"id": 10540, "text": null, "quote": "We are operating as a social business because we believe in the our value proposition (to the healthcare sector, and institutions supporting people with disabilities).

Yet, many of the young people I interviewed expressed that this presence brought them comfort and helped in their recovery, because the memory of their loved one is permanently embedded into their social media networks and uses, and the digital footprints they share can be achived and memoralized on the\u00a0digital\u00a0platform of social media (they pay less attention to the\u00a0public\u00a0nature of some of these platforms).\nMemorialization of the dead for the dead who can no longer speak for themselves is indeed tricky.

Is it possible to \"jump a generation\" in the organization of health care provision in developping countries? This is the underlying question of the \"modern\" collaborative care expriences we are going to share in this post about Coeur d'Or.\nAs a short backgrund, Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) induce yearly about 17 millions of deaths. Over 75% of those deaths occur in LMICs where risk factors are highly prevalent and the health system is poorly adapted to deal with chronicle and highly expensive emergent conditions. In Benin, the prevalence of high blood pressure is about 30%. Health promotion on this poorly funded issue, in this limited resource setting, requires innovative communication tools. To this end, C\u0153ur d\u2019Or (www.facebook.com/groups/coeurdor/ ) was created in 2011, to test the feasibility of using social media for providing promotional and preventive care against CVD in Benin, in a collaborative way.\nWe aim\u00a0here to present briefly\u00a0C\u0153ur d\u2019Or , and some lessons learned so far. We use a case study approach based on participatory observation, (in) formal in-depth interviews with different stakeholders and documents reviews on the solution. \u00a0Social media analytics tools are used for the quantitative analysis of the profiles of the solution users and activity.\nC\u0153ur d\u2019Or is an open Facebook group of 21615 members, mainly from Benin (West Africa). It runs as a tool of keeping in touch with a huge number of the community members, allowing for a double-sense communication, spreading cutting-edge information on CVDs and building a community-based leadership on CVD. The targets are young, mainly from urban and semi-urban areas, educated and active on social media. They connect to the platform using mainly smartphones.\u00a0 A wide range of subjects related to CVDs and Non-Communicable Diseases are discussed from several perspectives. Members can initiate a discussion stream, receive inputs from several profiles of members and get a summary from a medical expert based on key evidence-based prevention measures against CVD.\nThe group stands also as a social mobilization and community participation tools influencing the agenda setting at the national level. It is currently a member of the Multisectorial National Committee against NCDs in Benin, as a leading actor supporting the organization of national campaigns against CVD in Benin each year since 2011.\u00a0 Using its online critical mass and its growing network in traditional media and several public and private institutions, the group is capable of mobilizing each year since 2013 material and financial resources up to 25,000 \u20ac to organize offline activities such as a walk (about 5000 participants each year), risk factors screening, interactive conferences during the world heart day. All those activities help at reaching people that are not active online and are done with the leadership of members that are not health workers.\nThe rapid development of telecommunications improves the access of a growing number of people to Internet and social media. A critical mass of the group improves its political influence and creates a web tool that can help for a viral diffusion.\nC\u0153ur d\u2019Or demonstrates the feasibility of using social media as an innovative approach for offering promotional and preventive care on health issues in sub-Saharan Africa.

There's this beautiful play between the physical world and the non-physical (spiritual), which goes beyond words and at the same time can be very simple in heart. In my experience we are learning to trust and act upon our hearts' desires and letting go of the certainties of the known. Learning to be fully into life and at the same time peacefully creating the life that's feels really good, often being unpredictable, confronting with new challenges along the way of growth. Yet, totally clear from another perspective, which is often only afterwards understood.\u00a0\nTo me there's roughly two aspects to creation, finding love and expressing it. In whatever way feels most relevant. So creating new realities is about this expression. Expressions of love, expressions of fascination, of being intrigued by a question. This passion, like life can often only be looked upon afterwards. Yet is highly stimulating during the process. At the same time, we can experience a deep peace from within. Growing and integrating. Expressing and being silent. Creating new realities requires both in my experience. Going into something, almost blindly. Being into the question, into life, almost unconsciously. Letting go of what I already know. And at the same time being fully aware of what's happening, even when I don't know where I'm going. I'm fully aware of what I'm experiencing, all of the feelings and sensations, getting to know myself. To me, creating is about holding space and love, it's also about exploring new states of being. More expansive versions of myself. Going into the unknown. Creating new realities, riding the edges, exploring new perspectives, and at the same time, taking care of each other, holding space, accepting all of yourself and everyone around you. Knowing the lows to accept the others and overcoming doubt, finding highs to thrive and create a more amazing life.\u00a0\nSo can we\u00a0do that?\nCreate new realities and find deeper love within and for each other? Can we create and hold space? Can we set up a world that's a reflection of the love and creative potential? Can we shine light on some of the systems that enslave us (like the way money is used to control us) and create new systems that support the dynamics of our potential? Can we let go of heavy concepts and perceptions such as ownership? Can we create a world that's natural and harmonious, yet inspiring and unknown? Can we co-create out of passion rather than looking for security? Can we step into the unknown and create with love? So how do we deepen the understanding of ourselves and our behaviours? And more importantly, how can we let go of everything that doesn't serve us. Can we accelerate into loving ourselves? Which techniques can we use? Which perspectives can we take? And physically how can we create lifes that actually feel inspiring and authentic?\n\nOver the last years I've been organizing several series of meetings about personal transformation and\u00a0living from the heart\u00a0(for instance;\u00a0Vrij met Geld/ Free with Money). Also I've worked and lived with changemakers communities, for instance at the Synergyhub in Rotterdam and several ecovillages/ ecocenter's, as well as intensely researched the topic of enlightenment and spiritual growth and the physical world. Over the last months I've started writing a book: Step into creation - guidebook for a co-creative universe. Recently I've started a platform \"Creating new realities\". One of the important lessons I learned is: \"you can't co-create if you don't resonate\" and \"a little shift in perspective\" is often all you need to get back into flow. When I stop resisting, things happen. \"When I let go, I know\". Behind the known is a infinite field of potential. There lies true excitement. There is infinite inspiration at our disposal. And at the same time, it's nice to play with the physical. So to make the world a reflection of our spiritual growth. To let both go hand in hand. To grow and deepen the quality of relationships and communities. To develop the society and create things that represent our love for the world and the mystery of creation. These are some of my most important reflections over my experiences. That's what I'd love to inspire and catalyze! To create realities that are infinitely inspiring and joyful.\u00a0\n\nLooking forward to co-create with you!\n\nEwoud", "created_at": "2017-05-22 17:58:52", "updated_at": "2017-05-22 17:58:52", "tag_id": 1610, "post_id": 846, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 813}, {"id": 10623, "text": null, "quote": "Changing attitudes and culture takes more.

I have been employed in the non profit sector as a Project Manager on various projects, after having explored and tested theatrical/drama techniques and incorporating that into Science Communication and Health Messaging. And let me tell you, I am completely motivated and inspired by this community and others toward this goal and Public Engagement.\nMy experience as a process facilitator includes various participatory methods including: photovoice, drama, collaborative/participatory video, workshop design and events design. I've resigned from my formal job in order to test additional methods which I believe have the power to stimulate dialogue, forge relationships across difference sectors and reach larger audiences in organic, fun and interactive means.\nSince resigning from my formal employment, I've begun developing concepts using Street Arts and collaborations to install live arts installations driven toward Public Engagement. Now, Public Engagement as a term itself is not void of ambiguity and misuse for the purpose of funding or green-stamping our professional works. This isn't anyone's fault as it's a field that is developing. We should strive for full participation in our works, not merely using the term as a stamp of approval. My project aims to forge relationships with very different bodies of knowledge and social status, i.e. biomedical professionals/scientists, community members and artists, all of whom I argue have equally important and necessary knowledge to combat illness, increase the status of general Public Health and, simply put, fight a battle using a full arsenal of knowledge and weapons.\u00a0\n\nAllow me to rewind, ever so slightly to paint a picture. I've previously sought to test photovoice as a participatory method by forging relationships with community members from an under-resourced community in Cape Town, South Africa, and Scientists from the University of the Western Cape. The project sought to bring these varied parties together in a participatory workshop process, after which community members were trained on DSLR cameras and instructed to capture the lived experience of food in their everyday lives. They could capture anything related but not limited to\u00a0the purchase, consumption or disposal of food. This project revolved around Cardiovascular disease and the Scientists involved were Seniors at the Cardiovascular Research Unit at the University of Stellenbosch. The array of visual material and accompanying narrative was phenomenal and utterly beautiful. It shed light on the constant negotiation of food and consumption in these communities, including the availability of food, what kind of food was deemed healthy or not, when it was suitable for food to be disposed, food as celebration and community building etc. To me, and the Scientists involved, this process unveiled knowledge on food consumption behaviour and more structural issues imposed on these communities. It was never simply a \"I want KFC and I shall buy KFC\". This food choice is always compounded by budget, compromise, available options, time of the month, etc. People are consciously and constantly negotiating and re-negotiating choices. My heart broke when a Senior member of the project sample pulled me aside mid-project and told me ...\n\"Nabeel, I've suffered from Type 2 Diabetes for 15 years. At least thats what the doctors told me. They gave me medication and send me away each month. But never before has anyone told me what Diabetes is in a way that I understand. Never before have they taken time to talk with me. But now I have these scientists in my backyard. And they can't leave until I know my body\"...\nIt's necessary to point out that even though this community has an approximate population of 100 000 it only has one superstore that either of us would immediately turn our back on. Most food products are sourced from small kiosks on the corners. Yes, I am still in shock. How and why are the most vulnerable excluded from knowledge and provision of services? An alarm bell rang in my head that I could not ignore since I resigned. We've been running projects with a very specific agenda which more often than not in the non-profit sector provides an income and life for the administering organization. The sad truth is peoples knowledge are not given the kudos and respect it desperately needs. And in this battle, that may just be our most prize weapon.\u00a0\nFastforward 8 months and I've developed a concept which: 1. aims to bring 3 very different bodies of knowledge together in a participatory,\u00a0collaborative and egalitarian process; 2. forge relationships between these traditionally-deemed exclusive fields, i.e. arts and science and; 3. test organic and participatory processes to create events and arts installations that extends this knowlege to a broader audience in a fun interactive means.\nNow. Back to my current project...\u00a0\nI have recently collaborated with the University of Cape Town's Swallowing the World project which is a curatorial project focused on the lived experience of TB. My team of graffiti artists and I joined the festival, set up 2.5 x 2.5m canvas in the middle of campus and contributed to this project on International TB Day. As the focus of the fest was on Destigmatization, we followed suit and allowed interaction between the audience and ourselves to influence or define the artpiece. A\u00a0short video of our work:\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThis project will be installed in South Africa, India and Botswana simultaneously and attempts to use culturally- and community-sensitve street art forms. As such, we are holding participatory principles as central to the success of the project as we would like to design the project trajectory, outcomes and art installations/events with all participants. You may be thinking that no Funder finds this ideal. Alas, we're all wrong. We have had alot of interaction with a potential funder who chose to view the testing phase on UCT in livetime. This live time viewing feature of our project is something we would want to function very much like Edgeryders as it allows for collaborations and creativity between individuals and entities that may not traditionally interact.\u00a0\nThis leaves me at your feet as I'd love feedback, interaction and potentially consider collaborations with not only this project but others moving forward. I'd love to work in varying contexts and establish relationships between and across scientists, community members and artists from varying countries. This will be my next step. Apart from the actual arts installations and events, as products, we will be developing a best practices publication focused on the entire project in each 3 countries. I will also carry my \"researcher\" hat for the duration of this project as I wish to study: the interaction;\u00a0immediate knowledge transfer between scientists, community members and artists; retained knowledge and overall impact. I would openly accept any suggestions or feedback...\u00a0\nFor now I continue on my mission to test community- sensitive and -relevant means of expression and trying to find ways of using those tried and tested methods as communication tools. After all, what we want are healthier , expressive and inclusive communities whether you choose to define that territorially or otherwise.

Young adults are increasingly affected by issues like anxiety or depression. Their circumstances make them particularly susceptible to psychological stress. As many leave the familiar framework of home and school and move into an uncertain future, the newly independents have to find alternative support structures. New living situations, potentially in a new city or even country, starting university or a job, all these developments entail a multitude of mental pressures. In a time where social media is so influential, standards of self-representation are an added factor. According to one of the psychological guidance counsellors at Studentenwerk Berlin; stress, loneliness and self-image issues are very common results among many students.\nAs part of our research, we interviewed several university students from different backgrounds about negative emotions like these. One question was how they handle situations of feeling sad, stressed or lonely. The main insight was that everyone experienced this shit, but no one liked to deal with it. A prominent theme in the conversations was the difficulty to talk about emotional problems \u2013 be it a missed project deadline, a loss in the family or an eating disorder. It was mentioned\u00a0that it was easier for them to open up to someone who had similar problems and could empathize. However, it is difficult to identify the people that can offer support\u00a0when everyone tries to hide their struggles.\nAs a result, most people\u00a0don\u2019t decide to seek help until they had been in increasing pain for a prolonged amount of time. Yet at this point of outreach, recovery is still far. As we learned from our interviews, it can take months to find care that is suitable to the individual and more months to see any progress. While there is a great spectrum of available options, the general idea of psychological treatment is still stigmatized. It is often not even perceived as a possible solution. The psychologists we interviewed mentioned that many of their patients came to them only after being referred by a general practitioner or friends who had tried therapy themselves.\nYet, we cannot force people to seek help. Keeping quiet about insecurities is a justified mental defence mechanism. When we share our feelings, we are vulnerable, exposed.

Citizens are told to stay home, stay out of the way as the professionals dust off their contingency plans\"\nIt seems that this is true in\u00a0cases where: a) a contingency plan already exists (e.g. Earthquake in Nepal, Disaster Relief in Sub-Saharan Africa) The above examples are plans for\u00a0disasters that occur frequently and regularly in places that share a geographic similarity or border.\u00a0It would seem logical to expect that, for example, a disaster relief plan for helping people in Nepal would also be of use if a similar problem occurred in Kashmir, or Bhutan. Since similar types of disaster are likely to occur in those place it makes sense to defer to NGOs on the ground in those areas.\nBut,\u00a0in order for us to 'leave it to the professional' there have to be NGO's willing, and able to step into that role in the space.\nWhat has happened in\u00a0Greece and Calais is\u00a0we have seen NGOs step up initially, but then step back from the problem.\u00a0Often because they cannot work with the changing political situation. I am thinking here of\u00a0MSF pulling out of\u00a0Lesvos after\u00a0the EU-Turkey repatriation deal occurred. (http://www.msf.org.uk/article/why-is-msf-closing-its-moria-project-on-lesvos)\nThe French government's\u00a0reluctance to acknowledge the legitimacy of the Calais camp\u00a0has created\u00a0a\u00a0vacuum.\u00a0So,\u00a0NGOs have struggled to work in that area. Because they cannot work\u00a0under license, they cannot reduce\u00a0the suffering there, except on a micro\u00a0scale.\nPerhaps the idea of sub-optimality in the system comes back to a\u00a0wider\u00a0idea. One that is floating around in other areas of the site, that of 'unlicensed behavior'. Once\u00a0an organisation or NGO becomes 'legitimate',\u00a0it tends to deal\u00a0with Governments. It starts to operate at a higher level politically. This brings with it more constraints on the way it can act (at least overtly).\u00a0It becomes more constrained to\u00a0do\u00a0things 'the correct\u00a0way' and less able to focus\u00a0on doing what is required.\nWhen there isn't a precident\u00a0for dealing with a disaster on the scale or in that location two options remain. Either improvise or adapt. Both options work with sub-optimality from different directions.\u00a0\nThe NGO is most likely to adapt. They will find solutions used in other areas, or to address different problems, and adapt them to the new situation. These solutions are 'tried and tested' and so they can point to evidence that shows where they have worked in the past. The NGO avoids looking bad\u00a0if this approach fails, because they can show ways it has worked before. Their cultural and political capital stays strong and they can work on a new response in the long term. I expect that the lessons learned by MSF et al during this decade's\u00a0refugee crisis in Europe will lead to contingency plans that will be used around the globe in the future. They struggle to deal with the problem in real time though.\nAt the other end the improviser continually adapts what they are doing to try new solutions. They are willing to try anything. They are willing to\u00a0fail\u00a0because they have no social or political capital to diminish, except with the people they work with directly.\u00a0This means they do not provide a consistent service, but they can evolve new solutions quickly through ongoing prototypes.

Worried for her safely her parents asked her to come home to Wexford to visit them, otherwise they would have to insist on visiting her in Dublin.

Les outils sont l\u00e9gions : Trello pour les fanas de post-it digital en mode collaboration, Slack comme forum organique et le saint graal de la collaboration d\u00e9centralis\u00e9s : Github. Tous ont une arm\u00e9e de fans, mais tous ont le m\u00eame probl\u00e8me : si il n\u2019y a pas une base de valeurs collaboratives sur quoi travailler, ces outils restent un beau d\u00e9cor. C\u2019est comme donner des outils de permaculture \u00e0 un fermier industriel : si il ne voit pas que les valeurs partag\u00e9es sont un atout majeur, il restera avec ces m\u00e9thodes classiques.\nLa Culture de la collaboration\nComme n\u2019importe quelle autre id\u00e9e soci\u00e9tale, elle devient omnipr\u00e9sente quand elle est vue comme une partie de notre \u2018culture\u2019. Mais aucune id\u00e9e n\u2019a fait partie de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 sans avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 confectionn\u00e9e d\u2019une mani\u00e8re ou d\u2019autre. Un premier pas pour aller vers cette \u2018Culture de la collaboration\u2019 est de voir l\u2019information comme un bateau qui doit arriver \u00e0 bon port. Ca ne sert \u00e0 rien de tenir l\u2019information pour soi, partage la avec la bonne personne, passe les bonnes id\u00e9es comme si c\u2019\u00e9tait un plateau de charcuterie \u00e0 une soir\u00e9e raclette. Chaque personne prendra bien soin de choisir l\u2019info qui lui convient le plus.\nCar une information qui v\u00e9hicule librement aide \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer le deuxi\u00e8me point : Ne perdez plus d\u2019\u00e9nergie \u00e0 r\u00e9inventer la roue mais essayer de contribuer avec des projets d\u00e9j\u00e0 existant. C\u2019est en ajoutant de nouvelles grilles de lectures, en rentrant dans un projet avec un autre angle ou d\u2019autres informations qu\u2019on apprend beaucoup. Rester dans son enclos n\u2019aide personne, m\u00eame si le r\u00e9flexe protectionniste se comprend : vous voulez contr\u00f4ler votre id\u00e9e contre un opportunisme qui pourrait se cacher derri\u00e8re chaque recoin. Mais si nous acceptions, comme c\u2019est d\u00e9j\u00e0 le cas dans les recherches universitaires, d\u2019avoir un syst\u00e8me de mentions g\u00e9n\u00e9rales pour la collaboration de projet, nous devrions avoir moins peur de cet opportunisme.\nRecr\u00e9er la membrane de confiance\nCar voil\u00e0, le grand probl\u00e8me qui se cache derri\u00e8re cette peur inn\u00e9cessaire de la protection d\u2019information: on \u00e0 perdu notre membrane de confiance entre humain. Tout dans notre entourage nous dit de se m\u00e9fier de l\u2019autre. Car comme disait ce bon vieux Sartre: L\u2019enfer c\u2019est les autres. Mais si nous relisons la th\u00e9orie du Darwinisme social nous voyons que c\u2019est notre aptitude \u00e0 collaborer qui \u00e0 fait que nous avons surv\u00e9cu aux animaux dix fois plus grand que nous, aux p\u00e9riodes glaciaire et aux famines.\nPour recr\u00e9er cette membrane de confiance nous ne devons pas croire dans \u2018les grand mouvements\u2019, car comme les grandes histoires, elles sont mortes avant d\u2019entrer dans la p\u00e9riode post Moderne. Soyons comme Enspiral, un r\u00e9seaux de petit groupes. Cr\u00e9ons des petits faits, pour r\u00e9apprendre \u00e0 se faire confiance. On ne doit pas d\u00e9crocher la lune, mais simplement savoir aider son voisin. La petite pierre que j\u2019apporte \u00e0 cet \u00e9difice est de prendre le caf\u00e9 chaque matin avec quelqu\u2019un d\u2019autre, d\u2019\u00e9couter son histoire et de voir ou je peut faire du lien.\nL\u2019ego doit donner place \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e\nDans notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 contemporaine nous donnons encore et toujours trop de place \u00e0 l\u2019ego, qui l\u2019emporte souvent en discussion de l\u2019id\u00e9e. Mais voil\u00e0 si nous voulons vraiment cr\u00e9er une culture de la collaboration nous devons mettre en place des freins \u00e0 l\u2019ego. De pouvoir \u00eatre fier de l\u2019ajout qu\u2019on a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 une id\u00e9e. Ne plus voir la collaboration comme une simple \u00e9conomie du (mauvais) couple, ou chacun donne et qu\u2019on fait les comptes quand \u00e7a ne va pas, mais se focaliser sur l\u2019id\u00e9e et les valeurs v\u00e9hicul\u00e9es en commun.\nPour \u00e7a la collaboration doit se faire par les faits et non par les mots. Trop souvent la r\u00e9union pr\u00e9c\u00e8de la participation, mais c\u2019est en faisant qu\u2019on apprend plus de la personne, que chaque personne est mise \u00e0 nue.

A country like Bangladesh, which is constantly facing threats of so many kinds of natural disaster, is being increasingly ignorant about its natural conservation. This country has only 17% of forests within. This by the way is getting narrower. Even the largest mangrove forest Sundarbans, which is an internationally recognized world heritage site, is also facing terrible manmade disasters and constant environmental pollutions. It has reached such a zenith, that the global-ecosystem is threatened with the loss of a majority of all species, by the end of this century. Everyone knows, but some chose to ignore it, some choose to remain silent about it. But I thought the simplest solution to address this problem is just plant more trees. It\u2019s a simple yet most productive solution to involve the youth, who first of all should be concerned about it; secondly should take initiatives to mitigate this problem. The idea to run an online campaign came to me due to the massive participation of youth in social media. My goals were very simple, engaging the youth to talk about the problem or at least make them realize how important it is to address the issue. Secondly, mobilize my community to take an initiative in real space so that they feel the necessity to do something about this particular problem.\nAlong with few friends, I started inviting people over facebook to join the event. All they had to do is plant 5 trees and nominate 5 other friends on facebook to replicate the same. This way it will work like a chain reaction and we will be able to see a huge number of trees getting planted in a short period of time. The campaign is still going on and more people are joining. I know it has not gone viral and the number is not that high. Because in reality if you want to mobilize your community for a good cause, you have to ensure some motivations for them. Social norms are something that people tend to follow. Online campaign is there to help create a buzz, to create an objective. Which means if someone can bring out the movement from online space to offline, it moves faster and better. This is exactly why I have planned to run this campaign both online and offline.\nPrimarily I even offered few things extra to carry on with the campaign. Since I am an online based entrepreneur and I have a client tale which is 3 years old, we kind of have a personal trust relationship with each \u00a0other. So I personally offered my clients, I'll plant trees on behalf of them for every sell worth $10.\nTo bring the campaign to reality, a part of that plan involves talking to the civil society and involving them. Therefore, we are in touch with mayor\u2019s office to propose an idea to tell the citizens, if they plants 5 trees, they'll get a discount on their TAX. The CEO\u2019s of top notch companies to take part in this initiative where we want them to initiate a tree plantation program as a part of their CSR activities. Encourage their employees to plant trees so that they can get a better record at the end of the year in the ACR. We've asked the Headmasters of local schools to run the campaign along with the students, whoever plants more trees and takes care of them properly, will get an excellence award & certificate from the school. Recently our PM received the award of CHAMPION of the Earth for her outstanding initiative on\u00a0increasing forests and going green. I am simply trying to follow her path to make a change. Because I believe, OXYGEN is the most needed thing on earth and one can not simply buy a healthy environment with money.

I\u2019ve worked a lot with refugees, doing legal orientation, helping them to find houses, jobs, but also writing projects to get funds to create new spaces of inclusion.\nFor me it\u2019s interesting to see how many edgeryders are interested in migration or refugee issues and what are the connections to spring up from the many well known problems of working with refugees. I think that it\u2019s possible to underline some key issues when talking about care in this context .\n\nHelping Relationships vs Peer Relationships\nKnow your rights vs Rights as a cage\nIntercultural problems and Empathy\nInclusiveness in our society/community: avoid ideological and too theoretical approach\n\nA little bit about my experience: In particular I would like to speak about my working period during the so called \u201cNorth \u00a0Africa Emergency\u201d for 3 years. It was a really hard situation for our (Italian) reception system. We were in the paradoxical situation to tell them: \u201cyou are an asylum seeker, you HAVE to be an asylum seeker, if you want to have any chances to stay in Europe\u201d.\nIn effect after the Arab Spring Revolution (2011) everything changed. A lot of people that came from Horn of Africa or from other Sub Saharian regions and were in Libya for work decided to come in Europe. Gaddafi\u2019s death meant the end of every agreement \u201cPetrol vs Migrants\u201d that Italian Government had signed with Berlusconi in 2009 (for more details, this Guardian article). So you\u2019d have more asylum seekers in Europe, but also different routes, different countries of origin, different reasons to leave their countries.\nIn 2011 asylum seekers in Italy were more than 40.000 (4 times more than 2010, Eurostat) and Italy became the fourth country for the number of claims submitted, mainly from Nigeria,Tunisia, Ghana and Mali. Most of them have lived for many years in Libya, illiterate in their own native language, living in segregated conditions of work or in the terrible detention centers.\nThe history is long and I\u2019 don\u2019t want to become boring, but only to say that it\u2019s not possible to speak about refugees in general when trying to be of real help. We have to think about the countries where we are and where they come from (for example 90% of Syrian refugees that arrived in Italy decided not to ask asylum here, but in other north EU countries), the migration routes, the particular war conditions, but also the economical ones..\nFor all these reasons it was hard to prepare asylum seekers during North Africa Emergency because they came here for Lybian crisis and most didn\u2019t leave their countries for reasons of \u201crace, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion\u201d (Geneva Convention) or for war crisis in their countries (subsidiary protection). And so it was difficult to explain them that formally they have to be asylum seekers, that we need to find these elements in their stories. How could we help them? I usually do some group or individual meetings to inform them about procedures, about what does it mean to ask asylum and I prepare them for the Audition. How to help them to underline important elements in their stories, not lying... A lot of also ethical questions..(Legislation vs Reality)\nA relation of care: teaching a foreign language\nThe relations between us is a relation of help. Sometimes you can help someone too much.\nThe question is more to create opportunities for people to be really active (refugees as #nospectators). There are language barriers, cultural misunderstandings, different contexts of life, different expectations.\nIn this complex and nonlinear context of work that I would like to start from the first point: the challenge to learn a new language, the language of the recipient country. It could be difficult and, in some situations, also impossible, like a WALL.\nThis could be because learning a language means that you accept to be in a country, you decide to start again your life. For a lot of vulnerable people that are victims of violence (in their countries of origin or during the migration travel) it could become a catalyst of bed experiences.\nSo learning a language becomes the first step to say: \u201cI\u2019m here. I would like to take part in this new society and new community.\u201d\nFor all these reasons we needed to share knowledge and experiences about \u201chow to teach in more effective way?\u201d, we needed to create a community - or better to create a space for a community of italian schools! So we started with: www.milano.Italianostranieri.org\nIt is a platform of the Municipality of Milan to help foreigners find a school of Italian; there are a lot of problems to find the right schools, also because there are a lot of schools but not connected.\nWe saw that there is this tendency to work alone, providing a service but without \u00a0sharing knowledge, critical points.. We knew people that attend 3 different classes, for months, \u00a0but they couldn\u2019t speak Italian!\nSo we decided to open our website to every school, private, public, run by volunteers, by NGOs.\nIt\u2019s not simple to help, to take care of someone. It\u2019s a relation full of responsibilities, and good intentions often aren\u2019t enough. We noticed also some schools that are so active in helping their students, helping them in legal stuff or finding jobs.. But all these activities could be dangerous, create a bubble, a dependence relation, mixed with ideological thoughts ..\nYour students are not yours.\nTo create a community we realized \u00a0real life meetings between teachers and schoolmakers. Every school has the possibility to post directly activities, news. So everyone can have an always updated map of time classes, levels, locations etc; But also a moment of exchange between teachers, methods and materials. The teachers all together wrote also an handbook for teachers (in Italian only). We also created an e-learning database to help people to find free resources on internet and a lot of videos (in 5 languages) to explain Laws. Education system...\n\u00a0\nI\u2019ve been asked what projects I think can really make a difference: Projects that work on the concept of resilience,\u00a0avoid that people identify themselves with their own pain.\nWe saw a lot of people that 5 or 6 months after their arrival start to fade, to turn off. During the first months you hope that your rights became effective, job, home.. But nothing happens. Your life becomes full of complaints.\nA very interesting school that is part of the community is for example, Asnada. It\u2019s a Montessori/Experimental\u00a0school. The idea is to teach in a different way. Helping people to use this new language not as a \u201cstranger\u201d language. Usually you start to have 2 languages: the native one that is the language of feelings and relationships and a second language that is the language of bureaucracy. The idea is to teach a language that helps you to construct your new identity, \u201ccreate your new life here in a new language\u201d.\nSo the lessons became a workshop where we, all together, construct the language, with different ways, methods (arts, music, plays..) and also being a community.\nSo in my opinion it\u2019s really important to be able to find new ways to take care, creating effective spaces of meeting, of real exchange.\nWork on resilience, opening workshops where people can create something (for ex. FabLabs, Makerspaces..) using open technologies (like Raspberry Pi) could become new ways to take care of people in really big troubles, with strong vulnerabilities and help them to start again.\nMaybe Opencare, Edgeryders community could be the right place where to start!!\nWhat do you think?", "created_at": "2017-04-22 22:06:12", "updated_at": "2017-04-22 22:06:12", "tag_id": 1659, "post_id": 515, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 482}, {"id": 10853, "text": null, "quote": "I am wondering if the\u00a0community would have gotten better if it was organised by the\u00a0groups in question\u00a0instead of the municipality.\nWhen talking about Italianostranieri you mentioned that it was useful as a coordination tool for schools - to help them come together and share knowledge.

Through our social and educational work, we try to answer a question: how can we live together taking care of our specific differences?\u00a0 Far from the identity concept, we make the most of our similarity, using the new language (Italian) as a common ground. We have opened a first school for refugees and asylum seekers and, some years later, a school for unaccompanied minors. We are now nine (eight women and a man) coming from different backgrounds (Journalism, Pedagogy, Classical Studies, Education, Psychology, Cultural mediation, Languages) and ages (from 25 to 55).\u00a0\nOur schools are the places where we try to build up familiar relationships and a sense of community, but also the place where we try to understand, together, the contradictions of the world we live in. The learning group has here an essential role because it\u2019s the context in which every single student find his place, support and the courage to express himself. The variety of writing and speaking levels we look for in the student group is meant to lead to a free and informal circulation of knowledge and language skills, creating a context where the directory of teaching is also transversal, not only vertical.\nThe language we teach is not only the language of the daily routine, but an intimate language which allows people to reshape and rename their past and present experience, together with their aspirations and future projects. In order to allow everybody to have the opportunity to express himself or herself, we don\u2019t only use the spoken and written language: theatre exercises, songs, handcraft workshops, games, silent books, pictures and images, silk-screen printing, short films are the means through which explore the new language and ourselves.\u00a0\nMontessori\u2019s instruments give an important support to the learning process, as they help reading and writing but also studying grammatical and syntactical structures. We both use original instruments (for example, sandpaper letters, movable alphabet, set analysis and grammar symbols) and readapted tools we calibrated on purpose for the whole group.\nDuring these years we\u2019ve been meeting more than six hundred people coming from all over the world. This exchange of unconscious knowledge constantly creating new ways of schooling and in these years made us organize specific projects based on students real needs or passions:\u00a0\n\nThe discover of the importance - especially for illiterate students - of learning at a slow rhythm, also thanks to practical activities, is the reason why, three years ago, we started to organize \u201cThe ground language\u201d (La lingua della terra), a class around the growing of a vegetable garden and the study of the organic agriculture principles.\u00a0\nThe comprehension of the role of the mother tongue in our life, as the skeleton of our soul, press us to find a way to support and promote all the mother tongues. So, we hold up a group of story-tellers named \u201cRoots and Branches\u201d (Radici e Rami) sharing traditional and fairy tales, poems and myths in the first languages and in Italian.\u00a0\nDue to the need to use as soon as possible the new language also in order to better understand the world where we are living, with its contradictions, injustices and opportunities, we started to explore the city not only as tourists but as researchers: recorder, camera and a set of questions are the equipment with which we walk through the city asking people we meet to share their ideas, their point of view and experience about an issue which is meaningful for all the group.\nThe importance to look at the students as men and women having resources, abilities and strength enhance equal relationships.\u00a0\n\nFrom 2016, Asnada collaborates with the groups Nuovo Armenia and Gina Films. The City of Milano has assigned to us a farmstead (Cascina) situated in the centre of Dergano, a neighbors in the north of the city, in order to build up a place where migration issues could be faced through a cultural production, developed with the foreign communities themselves.\u00a0\nOur goal is to reshape the collective perception of the migration issue with the direct experience of a possibile living together, in order to avoid the usual relationships based on charity or humanitarian help. The \u201cCascina\u201d will be the place where, besides our schools, will be held a multilingual cinema where foreign and Italian people will watch movies in original languages, but also a cafeteria (with controlled prices) and a coworking area. The collaboration of schools and cinema\u00a0wants\u00a0to start a process of thought consciousness by crossing these two situations: italians dealing with foreign languages, and foreign people dealing with Italian and other foreign languages.\nThe \u201cCascina\u201d will be also a place for permanent education in intercultural field, where we will set meeting, readings, conferences and workshops open to all citizen, with a particular regard to the foreign communities of the neighbors.", "created_at": "2017-05-22 18:09:38", "updated_at": "2017-05-22 18:09:38", "tag_id": 1659, "post_id": 828, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 795}, {"id": 10855, "text": null, "quote": "It finally was the comment of a fellow student, which led us to modify our topic to what it is about now.

It was organized C-Mine Genk, an innovation laboratory in the old coalmines of the Flemish region of Limburg. I got selected as one of the finalist for my solution for a solution for the intergenerational gab, commonly known as the kids that don\u2019t visit grandma anymore because she is to old\u2026\nFor my solution I started by looking at the obvious part: intergenerational contact is good for the health of the elderly and also good for the development of the kids on multiple levels. So what was missing is a tool that brought them together.\nI grew up in a rather unconventional setting for people of my generation and later (90s kids like the internet would say) My parents and i shared the house with an elderly woman that wasn\u2019t my grandmother but the godmother of my dad. She was rather cultivated woman with brought knowledge about geography, literature and history. She helped me out on my schoolwork and we shared our interest in reading the news. When she started having difficulties to move out of the house, I helped her staying young by introducing her to the then new technology called DVD and PS2. We played bowling on the Wii and if she would have stayed around longer, I\u2019m sure she would have used my tablet. In opposite to my grandmother who was visiting us every week, my \u2018m\u00e9m\u00e9\u2019 stayed young in her head, and i think it was patly thanks to our dayle exchanges. She would learn me about history and i would learn her about technology.\n\u00a0\nSo when designing my idea i took this story and tried to create the mechanisms that made it work and what was needed to scale up. I found that people where already implementing wii\u2019s in elderly homes to give them exercise. While this is a good idea for them to exercise, the intergenerational part was still missing. So how could we create a game where kids needed to come to the elderly without them having the feeling it was a burden?\nWell you know those games on your phone where you need to do repetitive tasks to go up levels to beat new monsters, like 99% of all mechanics of Role Playing Games? Why not extrude those mechanics of training to the elderly. Give them exercises they can do all day to gain skill points. Arm movements will help the Atk stat for example, Balance will help Def stat and so on. The twist is that the kids playing the game will need to go physically to the elderly to get their little guy leveed up. Want to beat a new boss, but you miss some skillpoint, well go to one of the elderly homes where they play the game and go talk with them. Maybe the first time the discussion will be pure mechanical, but when returning a bound will be created between the people and discussions will be about more then only the game. You have to see it as an incentive to bring people together.\nAfter presenting this project i finished third and got 500 euro\u2019s to spend on material for the project. At that time i was even less into the entrepreneurs world and i failed to continue this project.\u00a0 I still think there are some logics and mechanisms that could be interested to work out.

While there has been an immense growth of international organisation in many areas (NGOs e.g. Greenpeace, TNCs e.g. Vodaphone, GM, Tata), there has been a dearth of overtly international political movements since the collapse of communism. In the context of Tsipras' remarks, we need transnational, pan-european political and social movements. We have the structural underpinnings - in the form of a common language (English dominates the EC) and technologies (social media, etc.). We have the political context in that it has become more and more clear that decisions are no longer made by our national governments for a whole range of issues. We have a clear democratic deficit (the weakness of the European parliament is well known). All this augurs well for a revolution in political action which crosses international boundaries and co-ordinates its activities. There are three movements which have to varying degrees expressed this: the Greens and more recently the Pirate Party and the Occupy Movement. Thus while the time may be ripe for revolutions, wars and other such unpleasantnesses, it may also be a opportunity for political maturity across the board, across social classes and national divides. This may sound somewhat utopian but looking at the realities of today in Europe we could just as easily tip into war (real hard war) as we could into creating trans-national political organisation with specific demands and legislative agendas.

Health care practices vary considerably across Amish communities and from family to family. Many Amish use modern medical services, but others turn to alternative forms of treatment within their community. \u00a0The Amish society accepts responsibility for their own actions and chooses not to depend on services offered by the state and Amish communities opt out of the government-funded insurance.

In any case, a massive case of market failure occurs around personal data, where people simply cannot understand the value of their personal data, and the way it aggregates to become incredibly powerful.\nSo that's the cut-and-dry economics, but, much more than ever that ever before,\u00a0Patrick\u00a0persuaded of a rational position which is sceptical of economic theory. In his view, using money to value things causes people to have a different psychology. It makes it easier, for example, to abuse natural resources, because it makes them abstract. So when I explained that the market is a wonderful way of allocating resources, that it does a magical computation to prioritise what people most want, he agreed. But at the big scale, the environmental scale, the use of money causes this damaging psychological disconnect. When people explain to me why they don't like economics, I often feel it's because they don't get how powerful it is, our conversation didn't follow that pattern.", "created_at": "2015-02-19 12:22:21", "updated_at": "2015-02-19 12:22:21", "tag_id": 1702, "post_id": 3889, "creator_id": 1974, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 3856}, {"id": 10972, "text": null, "quote": "\u201csharing\u201d economy was a running theme throughout various sessions, and the conundrum of how to tap into excess resources while not disenfranchising those who rely on existing economic systems was at the center.
