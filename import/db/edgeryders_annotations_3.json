Is usually delegated to the patients the duty of providing the accurate information about their health condition every visit.\n\n\n\tThe missing digitalization of the gathered health data and the consequent discontinuity of the healing process.\n\n\n\tThe limited precision of the anamnestic research due to the high number of patients and the short time available.\n\n\n\n\n\tFinal User, individuals and\u00a0community target\n\n\n\n\nResQ is conceived to ease the communication among physicians (involved in critical context such as emergency hospitals and refugees reception centers) regarding the health state of foreigner patients who don\u2019t know the language of the hosting country. In this way, the tool is designed for physicians, but the main benefits will come for migrating patients whose this services is dedicated to.\n\n\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/embed/MZSMi316E-Y\n\n\n\n\n\tSolution, brief description of the project\n\n\n\n\nResQ is a mobile management tool that improves the communication among healthcare workers (especially physicians, but also volunteers, nurses etc etc...), getting as a result the reduction of the language barrier that very often doesn\u2019t allow foreign patient to fully explain their symptoms or their own pathologies.\n\nThe personal pathological condition besides being a psychological kind of weight, for instance when a patient has to explain multiple times his/her condition to a series of different medical specialists, it could also lead to misinterpretation and diagnosis issues when there might be a language barrier.\n\nResQ is conceived to to be used mainly during the period in which the migrant still doesn\u2019t own a \u201cCodice Fiscale\u201d (personal unique fiscal code), but only a STP card (Straniero Temporaneamente Presente), that makes her/ him able to benefit from the main national healthcare services (for 12 months maximum).\n\nThe reception centers that provide the STP card and give the first medical assistance, have to deal with a very high number of people in a stressful situation that often lead to a superficial treatment.\n\nIn this way we designed an agile gathering data tool that saves time and in few minutes would be able to fulfill a complete health history of the patients. Also, the digitalization of such a document would make possible an extensive sharing with colleagues that later will take care of the same patient.\n\nTherefore the physician will have the chance to communicate autonomously among themselves without misunderstanding through the management tool.\n\n\nResQ-board.jpg2045x2500 640 KB\n\n\n\n\n\n\tTechnologies we will adopt\n\n\n\n\nThe tool we are designing will be developed in order to be accessible from the main devices available on the market. Therefore we envision applications possibly developed in their native languages as Java or Android and Objective-C foe iOS ambients.\n\nEven though we believe a mobile tool might be most suitable solution for the specific usage context we are working on, we would like to provide also a multi-platform responsive app developed in HTML5.\n\nThe cloud service might be developed in NodeJS, with database in MongoDB and MySQL.\n\n\n\n\n\tWebsite", "created_at": "2017-11-28 02:23:13.063560", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:24:52.389468", "tag_id": 737, "post_id": 866, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 833}, {"id": 12364, "text": "", "quote": "Here is how drones will be useful in Poland though I know it's not relevant.

People quickly made the conclusions that border control could be discriminatory or make mistakes. Similar to the Austrian example, there are claims that if you are an immigrant, or a woman with a child, the systems reduces your chances of getting access to resources to re-enter the employment market.Here we see the trouble with the systems, because they are already racialized and discriminatory systems of population control.

The concern about automated decision with discriminatory effect misses the point that a border system is already a very racialized and very discriminatory system. With regards to social welfare, especially unemployment systems are most likely to impact people with low economic resources, and a good portion of that is likely going to be immigrants. People quickly made the conclusions that border control could be discriminatory or make mistakes. Similar to the Austrian example, there are claims that if you are an immigrant, or a woman with a child, the systems reduces your chances of getting access to resources to re-enter the employment market.Here we see the trouble with the systems, because they are already racialized and discriminatory systems of population control. That they\u2019re discriminatory is not just at the level of the algorithm, but the whole system. The fact that it\u2019s optimizing over that population is already very problematic, because it\u2019s going to optimize with respect to somebody\u2019s understanding of what is optimal. The discriminatory effect is just an additional factor, but it\u2019s not the main factor. How can government agencies who employ AI start making claims about fairness, when they\u2019re in themselves problematic institutions.", "created_at": "2020-11-24 17:04:27.983306", "updated_at":

We organize practical workshops for children from all backgrounds to get them in touch with biology in a fun way. We do this because the role of biological technologies will become increasingly bigger as we move towards a circular society. Education plays a fundamental role in allowing people to be a part of this process.\n\nWhy are we doing this? My personal motivation is best shown through\u00a0a memory from my biotechnological engineering studies. We went on a company visit to Monsanto. At the time, I was not particularly aware of the dirty business they were in. We got to see the production facility, water treatment installations and large glyphosate tanks, which are all used to produce Roundup. During the luxurious lunch, which Monsanto employees also attended, a fellow student whispered to me: \u201chow can they sleep at night, considering they work for such a questionable company?\u201d. That was the only thing that I heard about the issue from anyone at school, both teachers or students. I didn\u2019t (now to my shame) know anything about Monsanto at the time and had to look it up myself afterwards. I was baffled and disgusted. What are we teaching our students?\n\nAside from the perspective we teach, relevance is important as well. I hated biology in high school. If you had told me I\u2019d be a bioengineer someday, I would have laughed in disbelief. The content of biology class often remains descriptive (you\u00a0learn about the parts of a plant cell), while higher education and jobs are all about application (you use these plant cells to grow something useful, like a building). A child that likes\u00a0engineering, design and coding should consider\u00a0studying biology. This is fundamental if we want enough people to develop sustainable technologies for the future.\n\n\nIMG_20160831_204348_0.jpg2500x1875 357 KB\n\n\nReaGent has been going for about a year. We\u2019ve experimented with several ways to bring biology closer to society. We've had children work with enzymes, build\u00a0their own microscope, extract DNA and much more.\u00a0The coming year, we will expand to reach more children and this scale-up entails several challenges.\n\nCell division\n\nAs a first step, we have decided to continue the project under a new name: Ecoli. The DIY biolab in Ghent will stay as ReaGent, while Ecoli will provide biology education to children and underprivileged groups. A DIYbio space or biohackerspace and child education are not very compatible regarding administrative or legal aspects, like insurance and licenses. Another reason for the split is the different story we want to tell.\n\nThe story to inspire a citizen scientist or biohacker is different from the story to inspire a child. Moreover, DIYbio has had issues with public perception. We find it important that knowledge is spread equally and that everyone can participate in an open discussion. We would not like a distorted image to shape decisions and opinions of people, leading them to self-censor and potentially miss out on learning opportunities.\n\nThe creativity, mindset and ethics\u00a0present in a DIYbio lab strengthen and form the way we educate. We feel like we get the benefits without the drawbacks if the DIY biolab and educational project are two separate entities.\n\nFunding education in a fair way\n\nThe question that I posed in the initial post\u00a0was on how to fund education outside of, but as an addition to, the traditional state-funded system.\n\nMaking a project like this financially sustainable is a challenge. The groups where we have our biggest impact, and thus create the most value, are also least capable of paying for it. We have set up a way to partially fund this by doing workshops in the classical school circuit. Our impact there is equally important and they can afford to pay (a little) for our services. It remains to be seen if we can sustain ourselves in the long term.\n\nChances are, we\u00a0will\u00a0have to find funds elsewhere \u2013government or industry. Government is the obvious choice, since education falls under their responsibility. Though, as often with government, it would be na\u00efve to count on funding. Additionally, it entails somewhat of an administrative burden (especially in Belgium and the EU) and it\u2019s a slow process.\n\nSo, do we want to cooperate with big biotech companies? How will this affect what we want to achieve with Ecoli? Do we risk that public opinion, or opinions of parents, ultimately influences\u00a0what a child learns? Biotech has plenty of shortcomings \u2013funding and market mechanisms, ethical,\u00a0ecological\u00a0and the list goes on. But it\u2019s a technology, a tool that can be used for good and bad. The drawbacks that I mentioned are effects of the way it is used and not inherent to the technology. If we are scared of biotech, it is because we are scared of ourselves, and rightfully so.\n\nWe still have the option of telling a nuanced story. Especially if we can highlight these issues during education, which is a rarity. My personal Monsanto experience is only one example.\n\nCaring with science\n\nMore fundamentally, care is everyone\u2019s responsibility in one way or another. Earlier this week, one of our team members went to visit an institute that accompanies people with a mental disability. He visited them to explain what we do and to offer them biology workshops for their audience, the responsible\u2019s jaw dropped as she launched off in enthusiasm, pointing out all the ways we could cooperate. She said nobody ever thought of deeming their people worthy of science oriented workshops. Even if it\u2019s just for entertainment, science or technology can be used for care. People have a tendency to underestimate capabilities of certain groups, like little kids or special needs people. On the other hand, there\u2019s a tendency to overestimate the intelligence required to grasp or play with basic principles. The power lies in how it\u2019s communicated.\n\nThis is only one of plenty of groups that don\u2019t get equal chances for quality education. It is part of the mission of Ecoli to provide those groups the opportunity to learn and discover.\n\nBeyond the tools\n\nWe are likely at the start of a similar revolution like the digital revolution. That means we have the chance to try and anticipate this time round; to try and prepare people; to embed values, like openness and inclusiveness, that make sure we don\u2019t need to fix the problems of accessibility and literacy afterwards.\n\nWhat we do can be considered an experiment and in many ways, it\u2019s not necessarily about biology. We hope that, in addition to growing a basic biological literacy, we help to build\u00a0a shift in attitude. When we watch global developments, it is clear that the biggest problems we face don\u2019t require technological solutions. Even problems that are directly caused by a misuse of technology, like climate change, could be headed towards a solution by changing our attitude, especially when combined with more sustainable bio-based technologies. A change in behaviour is not likely to happen overnight, but if we can build institutions that promote caring, collaboration and trust, we might be on our way.\n\nWe are engaging with the Edgeryders community because we hope our actions can be part of a bigger solution. One where different actors work on improving their respective fields. By sharing experiences of our project with the Edgeryders community we hope we can grow more resilience for everyone.\n\nWe will be attending the workshop in Brussels on the 24th of September and would be delighted to meet you!\n\nIf you connect to our story, let us know! We love feedback and discussing the subject. Here\u2019s some other questions that occupy our mind. Should this type of initiative stay an addition to the state-funded system? Is this form of bottom-up activism, independent of the government or in spite of it, ultimately a desirable strategy?\n\nThe production of this\u00a0article was supported by\u00a0Op3n\u00a0Fellowships\u00a0-\u00a0an ongoing program for community contributors\u00a0during May - November 2016.\n              \n  \n  \n    \n    Edit\n    Delete\n  \nNo Commentcitizen science\n\n  \n    \n    \n      Cancel\nSave\n    \n  \nAnnotate", "created_at": "2017-11-28 14:00:02.854014", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:24:53.067713", "tag_id": 766, "post_id": 530, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 497}, {"id": 12567, "text": "", "quote": "Hi @mariekebelle\n\nI may need a bit more information before even trying to share any suggestion...\n\nFirst thing, I would like to ask you to confirm my understanding.\u00a0There are two separate issues that would need to be faced:\n\n1) how to enroll in a doctorate while being classified a refugee [this one should be reasonable]\n\n2) how to enroll in a doctorate as an already senior professional\n\nThe latter\u00a0is a bit complicated.

Is it for the student status/visa? Or for the need to receive economic support?

Attraverso un processo di ricerca abbiamo evidenziato come un approccio olistico, che a colpo d\u2019occhio fornisca un quadro clinico completo, comporterebbe indubbi vantaggi a medici e pazienti.\n\n1.2 Acquisizione di idee, spunti, intuizioni\n\nLo spunto iniziale che ha dato l\u2019avvio al progetto \u00e8 scaturito da una serie di interviste condotte tra medici e pazienti. Questi ultimi in particolare lamentavano la scarsa preparazione del medico rispetto al loro specifico caso clinico, delegando pertanto al paziente stesso, la responsabilit\u00e0 nel fornire informazioni dettagliate circa la patologia da affrontare.\n\n1.3 Definizione del problema\n\nIl problema che abbiamo affrontato pu\u00f2 essere definito come una carenza di comunicazione. I diversi professionisti della cura non possiedono, ad oggi, uno strumento semplice e veloce che possa tenerli aggiornati rispetto alla progressione clinica di ogni loro paziente. Le informazioni sanitarie sono disgregate e appartengono allo specialista che le ha prodotte attraverso la propria visita. Queste informazioni tendenzialmente non hanno altro modo di essere condivise, se non attraverso il paziente stesso, cui si delega il compito e la responsabilit\u00e0 di fornire tali informazioni allo specialista successivo.\n\nDoc.doc si propone essenzialmente come un aggregatore di informazioni, un unico database medico nel quale possano essere convogliati e organizzati i dati dei pazienti che si hanno in cura. In questo modo il medico pu\u00f2 affrontare ogni nuova visita avendo gi\u00e0 chiara l\u2019anamnesi pregressa del paziente in questione. Doc.doc inoltre fornisce tutti i contatti degli specialisti che hanno condotto una determinata visita in precedenza, e rende estremamente semplice (un clic) la possibilit\u00e0 di mettersi in contatto con un collega per richiedere un chiarimento o un parere rispetto ai dettagli di una certa una cartella clinica.\n\n2.0 Definizione\n\n2.1 Analisi delle soluzioni\n\nIn seguito ad una estesa sessione di una particolare forma di brainstorming, il brainwriting, sono stati vagliati diversi possibili approcci per affrontare il tema proposto dal bando OpenCare. Questi sono stati categorizzati in modo sistematico secondo la tecnica detta delle 4Cs (le quattro\u201dc\u201d: components, characteristics, challenges, characters) e quindi circoscritti in macro-aree che puntavano ad un certo specifico orientamento verso la risoluzione delle problematiche riscontrate in ambito sanitario.\n\n2.2 Ideazione del concept\n\nIn seguito ai risultati scaturiti dalle tecniche di brainstorming, \u00e8 stato realizzato un questionario da sottoporre ad un certo numero di pazienti, parenti dei pazienti e professionisti della cura (non solo medici, ma anche infermieri, farmacisti, fisioterapisti etc\u2026).\n\nQueste interviste si sono rivelate cruciali nel definire il percorso che doc.doc avrebbe intrapreso.\n\nInfatti, abbiamo riscontrato presso la maggior parte dei pazienti intervistati, una sostanziale insoddisfazione riguardo i processi di comunicazione con i propri medici. In particolare, nel caso di patologie particolarmente complesse, dove \u00e8 necessario il coinvolgimento di molteplici specialisti, spesso i medici coinvolti sono parzialmente o totalmente all\u2019oscuro riguardo i progressi dei colleghi nei confronti di uno specifico aspetto nella cura della patologia. La comunicazione di queste informazioni, avviene, ma quasi esclusivamente per mezzo del paziente, il quale \u00e8 costretto ad assumersi la piena responsabilit\u00e0 dell\u2019accuratezza e completezza delle informazioni fornite.\n\n2.3 Proposta della soluzione\n\nIn seguito alla ricerca svolta, \u00e8 stato quindi logico cominciare a pensare alla progettazione di uno strumento gestionale che permettesse ai medici di avere immediatamente disponibili tutte le informazioni concernente un certo paziente, comprese le informazioni di contatto dei colleghi responsabili di una certa visita.\n\nAbbiamo cos\u00ec progettato uno strumento gestionale che facilita l\u2019organizzazione degli appuntamenti di un medico, ordina in maniera chiara le cartelle cliniche dei pazienti per tipologia e cronologia, permette in un clic di contattare un collega tramite telefono, chat o email, infine rende pi\u00f9 efficiente la visita stessa poich\u00e9 doc.doc consente al medico curante di aggiornarsi circa i progressi del proprio paziente nei minuti precedenti alla visita.\n\nDoc.doc infatti pu\u00f2 essere programmato per concedere uno spazio di tempo (tendenzialmente 10 minuti) tra una visita e l\u2019altra, che permetta al medico di prendere visione della cartella clinica del paziente che sta per incontrare.\n\n3.0 Sviluppo\n\n3.1 Progettazione e prova del prototipo\n\nDoc.doc allo stato attuale consiste in un prototipo interattivo realizzato attraverso la piattaforma proto.io.\n\nPrima di ottenere questo risultato abbiamo sostenuto una approfondita analisi UX che ci ha consentito di effettuare scelte precise circa lo sviluppo di certe funzionalit\u00e0.\u00a0In particolare, attraverso tecniche di Brainwriting e alcune empathy map abbiamo circoscritto l\u2019ambito di lavoro.\n\nA seguito di alcune interviste di orientamento con pazienti e professionisti sanitari abbiamo definito ulteriormente gli obiettivi del progetto, concentrandoci su una \u201cone primary task\u201d, che nel caso di doc.doc consiste nell\u2019aggregazione semplificata dei dati di ogni paziente. Considerando quindi alcuni ipotetici scenari di utilizzo del nostro servizio (presso specialisti\u00a0o medici di base, in studio o in visita a domicilio etc\u2026) abbiamo sviluppato una prima logica di user flow e infine la sua realizzazione grafica interattiva, della quale si pu\u00f2 avere una tangibile esperienza d\u2019uso qui: http://bit.ly/2oOXbmK (una volta scaricata l'intera\u00a0cartella \u00e8 sufficiente aprire il file index.html con il proprio browser, meglio se Chrome).\n\nInoltre in seguito allo sviluppo del prototipo \u00e8 stato condotto un piccolo usability testing\u00a0che ha evidenziato piccole problematiche, immediatamente risolte con il rilascio della versione successiva, di cui si pu\u00f2 prendere visione al link sopracitato.\n\n3.2\u00a0Prova della fruibilit\u00e0\n\nE\u2019 stato condotto un piccolo usability testing, parzialmente moderato, che ha sostanzialmente confermato tutti gli obiettivi di usabilit\u00e0 stabiliti a monte. In particolare i nostri utenti test sono stati, per la maggior parte, in grado di portare a termine le operazioni richieste, quali: 1. Consultare una cartella clinica, 2. Consultare la rubrica pazienti e professionisti, 3. Aggiungere un nuovo appuntamento, 4. Contattare un collega. In questa fase abbiamo ritenuto prematuro considerare ulteriore metriche di controllo oggettive quali tempi e statistiche di errore, concentrandoci piuttosto su misurazioni di gradimento soggettive e mantenendo come unico conteggio obiettivo il numero di operazioni portate a buon fine.\n\nSono stati riscontrati alcuni problemi nella fruibilit\u00e0 dei dati della cartella clinica e delle funzionalit\u00e0 ad essa collegate (\u00e8 infatti possibile anche iniziare una conversazione\u00a0con un collega). L\u2019organizzazione dei contenuti di quella determinata schermata \u00e8 stata quindi modificata sulla base dei feedback ricevuti, cos\u00ec come l\u2019intero look&feel dell\u2019applicazione \u00e8 stato rivisto coerentemente rispetto alle modifiche apportate.\n\n4.0 Rilascio\n\n4.1 Completamento del prodotto/servizio\n\nIl prototipo \u00e8 gi\u00e0 stato testato, ma andrebbe ulteriormente verificato su un campione pi\u00f9 esteso di utenti, seguito eventualmente da un A/B testing.\n\nConclusa la fase di usability testing sul prototipo, si proceder\u00e0 quindi con lo sviluppo di programmazione vero e proprio, la\u00a0cui funzionalit\u00e0\u00a0verr\u00e0\u00a0verificata\u00a0ad ogni milestone raggiunta.\n\nInfine, verranno concepite strategie di distribuzione, idealmente con il coinvolgimento delle ASL locali, per permettere un capillare ed effettivo utilizzo del servizio.\n\n4.2 Rilascio finale\n\nE\u2019 in fase di definizione una timeline di sviluppo che presenti le milestone necessarie al completamento del prodotto, secondo specifiche tempistiche.\n\n4.3 Produzione\n\nIl team di sviluppo tecnico \u00e8 ancora da definirsi, ma stiamo valutando una collaborazione con I-SEE\u00a0(http://www.i-seecomputing.com), specialisti nell produzione di software in ambito medico/ sanitario.", "created_at": "2017-11-28 14:07:49.723556", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:24:53.401425", "tag_id": 771, "post_id": 33729, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 6578}, {"id": 12575, "text": "", "quote": "But, in light of the collaboration with Anders this week, @Alberto , this seems like it would be a really cool dataset to compare with Open Care.

Also what works well is to set a clear invitation and some simple guidelines, such as the ones I described. They help the group process and give a certain structure to build up momentum.\u00a0My experiences have been diverse. I've experienced beautiful gatherings where love, depth and understanding were shared among all participants. Sometimes when the group was mixed deeply sharing also lead to some confusion as these depths were not familiar to everyone and not everyone seemed to grasp the depth of the experience of someone else. Although I think it didn't harm or shock anyone too much, I do think it may have lead to some confusion. For instance, I once went very deep receiving the talking stick and staying silent for a few minutes, all attention on me, I didn't want to \"just say something\" so I stayed present with my inner dynamics (and doubts) in front of everyone. Finally, I said something that felt true to me. So I remained connected to my inner truth. The woman who was sitting next to me didn't know how quick she had to say something when I gave her the talking stick. Ever since our contact between me and the woman have been somewhat weird. Coming to think of it, I should have probably talked to her sometime and exchange perspectives lightly....  (oops).\u00a0\n\nThis particular meeting was organized by a friend of mine btw and was a gathering of about 20 people, which is quite big for such a sharing. I'd say depending on the size of the group there will be different forms and formats that suit best the conversation. Not necessarily the bigger the group to more superficial. Groups can go very deep together when they are guided properly. This is a true art. And ideally, one question/ sharing leads to another, being able to deepen the conversation coming closer to opennings. And, maybe most importantly everything is good. So not resisting anything nor having an agenda helps for creating the space to be who you naturally are.\u00a0\n\nI believe the Circles of openness serve best around a certain theme that is loaded and which everyone has experiences with: I organized a series about money and I participated in one about sexuality. Both topics lead to a very vulnerable and warm sharing and brought everyone closer together. Also I think Circles work well for existing communities that work or live together, as tensions may arise during the daily practices. The latter I have some experiences with at the Synergyhub and the principle we used was to share from what's alive in you at the moment. This worked pretty well.\u00a0\n\nI also initiated a circle once during a workshop where people didn't really know each other and there wasn't a real theme or topic. In that setting it didn't feel really appropriate to do a sharing, as apart from being human and sharing a similar human experience (so there's always (some) interest), \u00a0there wasn't really a common intention or relevance to have this talk together. So I wouldn't organize a circle \"out of the blue\" again.\u00a0\n\nMost of the meetings I was with had both familiar people and strangers. As long as the intention for the meeting is clear, it's no problem and good examples will follow.\u00a0\n\nMost circles I went to lasted for about 1 to 2 hours. Although probably you know about retreats/ satsangs for instance with Bentinho Massaro that take about the whole day (with sessions of about 1,5 to 2 hours each). Have to say that during these days Bentinho (or some other \"teacher) is the one who does most of the talking. Yet, he knows how to bring a group into depth. So, even though it's a different form, there's also huge transformation happening during these meetings.\u00a0\n\n@Nadia about organizing this at The Reef. I would say a circle is very appropriate and effective if there is a theme or topic that has great interest. When this is the case, we can do it. You could also guide it yourself if you feel excited.\u00a0\n\nAnd is there a learning curve, @Noemi ? Yes, for me personally very much. Through sharing so openly in a public space among others really gave me confidence to be vulnerable and fully present. Also for many others I feel sharing with each other has this effect. During some of my meetings I really saw people transform, releasing some of the doubts and limiting beliefs they had about themselves! Truly magical to be there when that happens! Moments I have very exciting and warm memories of.\u00a0\n\nSo let me summarize my experiences:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nSharing from personal experiences - yet not getting caught up into the story. The aim is to gain clarity to let go of stories and have space te create the new.\u00a0\nCircles work well around certain (loaded) theme's and communities who work/ life together with a clear invitation.\u00a0\nListening from the heart, listening from beyond the personal perspective (not taking anything personal)\nEverything that pops up from a genuine sharing is welcome, even if it's off topic. What's alive here and now is relevant, provided it serves the conversation & transformation of the whole (including the individual).", "created_at": "2017-11-28 14:17:46.509066", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:26:33.651831", "tag_id": 819, "post_id": 24534, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 6368}, {"id": 12587, "text": "", "quote": "Check this idea\u00a0https://www.google.it/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://www.cisjournal.org/journalofcomputing/archive/vol6no1/vol6no1_3.pdf&ved=0ahUKEwiWsJ2qvffQAhUC2BoKHUNyA3cQFghBMAk&usg=AFQjCNGWv8ye9eDz8YbpRoss1KcMGNuXAg&sig2=UbefAdHIiZeESxyUpu6u6A\n\nA great idea of preventing harm when falling", "created_at": "2017-11-28 14:18:28.863691", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:26:33.730190", "tag_id": 823, "post_id": 17293, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 6035}, {"id": 12588, "text": "", "quote": "I can't say to you the exactly number of hours that my parents or grandparents take to have their own farming.\n\nMy parents have their jobs and they do these things on free time, weekends...", "created_at": "2017-11-28 14:19:39.213914", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:26:33.768435", "tag_id": 824, "post_id": 10918, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 1573}, {"id": 12591, "text": "", "quote": "feeling of insecurity towards the not yet known", "created_at": "2017-11-28 14:22:23.138252", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:26:34.067670", "tag_id": 829, "post_id": 669, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 636}, {"id": 12873, "text": "", "quote": "the nature of work in care-full societies;", "created_at": "2017-11-28 19:51:42.139650", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:31:38.582506", "tag_id": 1047, "post_id": 6304, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 6271}, {"id": 12874, "text": "", "quote": "Career guidance and counselling", "created_at": "2017-11-28 19:52:09.765128", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:31:38.587356", "tag_id": 1047, "post_id": 6293, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 6260}, {"id": 12875, "text": "", "quote": "What I make of this is that it's not about choosing between the open source or current proprietary\u00a0code/technology approach.

Many have found themselves in places and situations in which they never expected to be at this time in their career (eg having to go back home to live with families, shared resources etc). This affects some more than others and we must not assume that carrying on studying and teaching is possible in all circumstances. Most Higher Education institutions in the UK have responded by introducing exceptional regulations for assessment and the subsequent progression and degree classification results which arise from this.\n        \n  \n  \n    \n    Edit\n    Delete\n  \nNo Commentunequal opportunities\n  \n    \n    Edit\n    Delete\n  \nNo Commentteaching\n  \n    \n    Edit\n    Delete\n  \nNo

There are also many classes and participants around; so many tables, activities, computers, cables and..of course, people. There is a heterogeneity at work that makes such peculiar activities possible;\u00a0 half way instructional, half way productive.

I think in that sense, optimization systems, or machine learning, or AI propose a very specific model, and it\u2019s a very narrow model to organize allocation of resources. Given how little attention has been paid to these issues, it is really time to move beyond data and algorithms, and to focus on the forms of governance these technologies are brining and whether they fit with our imagination of how we want to govern our societies? Currently things are the other way around: technology companies are redefining forms of governance and proposing optimization as the only way to organize resource allocation. To succeed, these companies backdoor into the world through users. They use investment money to disrupt existing markets and outrun competitors. If and when they become the last ones standing, it may be too late to have the discussion whether we want the models of life that they propose and implement.", "created_at": "2020-11-24 17:13:27.226287", "updated_at": "2020-11-24 17:13:27.226287", "tag_id": 7308, "post_id": 64014, "creator_id": 5479, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 11514}, {"id": 19631, "text": "", "quote": "This is very interesting!

The story of a social studies teacher who gives an assignment to his junior high school class to think of an idea to change the world for the better, then put it into action. When one young student creates a plan for \"paying forward\" favors, he sets in motion a wave of human kindness which went nation wise. There was one main emotion which did lead these actions but also was produced or given back \u2013 love or/and compassion. Can this happen in real life?\nBoth psychologically and scientifically has been proven that positive emotions affect our health in a very positive way was well. Positive emotions release healthy hormones into our body and not only; the unhealthy release of cortisol and stress related hormones is lower as well. The most important emotions are gratitude, peace, joy, hope, and love. This external boost of positivity also creates neuro-pathways in the brain that are positive. This means that we are able to affect on the biological part of our brain and create a source of positivity which is supported externally as much as internally. Behavioral psychologists retain that even if aggressivity might be considered part of human nature, meaning that it is imprinted in our brain because of our ancestors or as part of human nature, a non aggressive behavior or approach can be taught. What would happen in the world if there would be more love and less aggressiveness?\nThe teacher on the movie says: \u201cIf you could help change the world, would you? What does the world mean to you? How often do you think about things that happen outside of this town? Do you watch the news? We are not global thinkers yet. What does the world expect of us? What if the world is just a big disappointment? Unless, you take the things that you don\u2019t like about this world and flip them upside down. How about, is possible? The realm of possibility, exists where? In each of you. So, you can surprise us. It\u2019s up to you. Or you can sit back and let it be. Make an attempt to interact with the world.\u201d And the kid gave his idea: \u201cPerson A, is me and I help three people in doing something that they cannot do by themselves.\u201d There was one condition, each person who was helped by the kid had to do the same thing with other 3 people, so there would be 9 people helped. And so on, each person with 3 people, and then other 3, and 3 more\u2026 A whole network of people helping one another.\nIn this world is so easy to be skeptic and cynic. It is bad but also the media is playing a big role in reinforcing the bad. Without even being aware we cause and attract negativity to ourselves. We fight, we hate, we break promises, and we disrespect nature, over think of our role as humans in this planet. This movie is one of those that stick with you and I have always wondered if this is something that can be applied in our everyday life. I was talking with a friend and colleague of mine \u2013 we have this new and fresh NGO, with no offices yet and we are trying really hard to get some money at least to cover costs for activities. I talked to her about the movie and the idea, if there is any chance to transform it into a project. The point where we are stuck is that we have not been able to find a way to measure the results and how to report it to the donor. However, what if we could start a campaign, spread the idea out there, and try to do it with no donors in order to not report to anyone. It needs money anyway.\nBut, what if it is possible? What if we can learn and teach how and to love? There is this video on youtube of a young man acting quit aggressively on a tram. You see all the people scared and panicking. All but an old lady, who took his hand on hers and just stayed like that sited near to him. The young man calmed down. That insignificant gesture of kindness might have saved his life and of other people who might have reacted the same way to him or with fear. Or for just ignoring him.\nThis is a project that we would love to see in practice really soon and maybe in this activity that you are organizing we might meet the right people or find the proper way to do it.

Attraverso un processo di ricerca abbiamo evidenziato come un approccio olistico, che a colpo d\u2019occhio fornisca un quadro clinico completo, comporterebbe indubbi vantaggi a medici e pazienti.\n\n1.2 Acquisizione di idee, spunti, intuizioni\n\nLo spunto iniziale che ha dato l\u2019avvio al progetto \u00e8 scaturito da una serie di interviste condotte tra medici e pazienti. Questi ultimi in particolare lamentavano la scarsa preparazione del medico rispetto al loro specifico caso clinico, delegando pertanto al paziente stesso, la responsabilit\u00e0 nel fornire informazioni dettagliate circa la patologia da affrontare.\n\n1.3 Definizione del problema\n\nIl problema che abbiamo affrontato pu\u00f2 essere definito come una carenza di comunicazione. I diversi professionisti della cura non possiedono, ad oggi, uno strumento semplice e veloce che possa tenerli aggiornati rispetto alla progressione clinica di ogni loro paziente. Le informazioni sanitarie sono disgregate e appartengono allo specialista che le ha prodotte attraverso la propria visita. Queste informazioni tendenzialmente non hanno altro modo di essere condivise, se non attraverso il paziente stesso, cui si delega il compito e la responsabilit\u00e0 di fornire tali informazioni allo specialista successivo.\n\nDoc.doc si propone essenzialmente come un aggregatore di informazioni, un unico database medico nel quale possano essere convogliati e organizzati i dati dei pazienti che si hanno in cura. In questo modo il medico pu\u00f2 affrontare ogni nuova visita avendo gi\u00e0 chiara l\u2019anamnesi pregressa del paziente in questione. Doc.doc inoltre fornisce tutti i contatti degli specialisti che hanno condotto una determinata visita in precedenza, e rende estremamente semplice (un clic) la possibilit\u00e0 di mettersi in contatto con un collega per richiedere un chiarimento o un parere rispetto ai dettagli di una certa una cartella clinica.\n\n2.0 Definizione\n\n2.1 Analisi delle soluzioni\n\nIn seguito ad una estesa sessione di una particolare forma di brainstorming, il brainwriting, sono stati vagliati diversi possibili approcci per affrontare il tema proposto dal bando OpenCare. Questi sono stati categorizzati in modo sistematico secondo la tecnica detta delle 4Cs (le quattro\u201dc\u201d: components, characteristics, challenges, characters) e quindi circoscritti in macro-aree che puntavano ad un certo specifico orientamento verso la risoluzione delle problematiche riscontrate in ambito sanitario.\n\n2.2 Ideazione del concept\n\nIn seguito ai risultati scaturiti dalle tecniche di brainstorming, \u00e8 stato realizzato un questionario da sottoporre ad un certo numero di pazienti, parenti dei pazienti e professionisti della cura (non solo medici, ma anche infermieri, farmacisti, fisioterapisti etc\u2026).\n\nQueste interviste si sono rivelate cruciali nel definire il percorso che doc.doc avrebbe intrapreso.\n\nInfatti, abbiamo riscontrato presso la maggior parte dei pazienti intervistati, una sostanziale insoddisfazione riguardo i processi di comunicazione con i propri medici. In particolare, nel caso di patologie particolarmente complesse, dove \u00e8 necessario il coinvolgimento di molteplici specialisti, spesso i medici coinvolti sono parzialmente o totalmente all\u2019oscuro riguardo i progressi dei colleghi nei confronti di uno specifico aspetto nella cura della patologia. La comunicazione di queste informazioni, avviene, ma quasi esclusivamente per mezzo del paziente, il quale \u00e8 costretto ad assumersi la piena responsabilit\u00e0 dell\u2019accuratezza e completezza delle informazioni fornite.\n\n2.3 Proposta della soluzione\n\nIn seguito alla ricerca svolta, \u00e8 stato quindi logico cominciare a pensare alla progettazione di uno strumento gestionale che permettesse ai medici di avere immediatamente disponibili tutte le informazioni concernente un certo paziente, comprese le informazioni di contatto dei colleghi responsabili di una certa visita.\n\nAbbiamo cos\u00ec progettato uno strumento gestionale che facilita l\u2019organizzazione degli appuntamenti di un medico, ordina in maniera chiara le cartelle cliniche dei pazienti per tipologia e cronologia, permette in un clic di contattare un collega tramite telefono, chat o email, infine rende pi\u00f9 efficiente la visita stessa poich\u00e9 doc.doc consente al medico curante di aggiornarsi circa i progressi del proprio paziente nei minuti precedenti alla visita.\n\nDoc.doc infatti pu\u00f2 essere programmato per concedere uno spazio di tempo (tendenzialmente 10 minuti) tra una visita e l\u2019altra, che permetta al medico di prendere visione della cartella clinica del paziente che sta per incontrare.\n\n3.0 Sviluppo\n\n3.1 Progettazione e prova del prototipo\n\nDoc.doc allo stato attuale consiste in un prototipo interattivo realizzato attraverso la piattaforma proto.io.\n\nPrima di ottenere questo risultato abbiamo sostenuto una approfondita analisi UX che ci ha consentito di effettuare scelte precise circa lo sviluppo di certe funzionalit\u00e0.\u00a0In particolare, attraverso tecniche di Brainwriting e alcune empathy map abbiamo circoscritto l\u2019ambito di lavoro.\n\nA seguito di alcune interviste di orientamento con pazienti e professionisti sanitari abbiamo definito ulteriormente gli obiettivi del progetto, concentrandoci su una \u201cone primary task\u201d, che nel caso di doc.doc consiste nell\u2019aggregazione semplificata dei dati di ogni paziente. Considerando quindi alcuni ipotetici scenari di utilizzo del nostro servizio (presso specialisti\u00a0o medici di base, in studio o in visita a domicilio etc\u2026) abbiamo sviluppato una prima logica di user flow e infine la sua realizzazione grafica interattiva, della quale si pu\u00f2 avere una tangibile esperienza d\u2019uso qui: http://bit.ly/2oOXbmK (una volta scaricata l'intera\u00a0cartella \u00e8 sufficiente aprire il file index.html con il proprio browser, meglio se Chrome).\n\nInoltre in seguito allo sviluppo del prototipo \u00e8 stato condotto un piccolo usability testing\u00a0che ha evidenziato piccole problematiche, immediatamente risolte con il rilascio della versione successiva, di cui si pu\u00f2 prendere visione al link sopracitato.\n\n3.2\u00a0Prova della fruibilit\u00e0\n\nE\u2019 stato condotto un piccolo usability testing, parzialmente moderato, che ha sostanzialmente confermato tutti gli obiettivi di usabilit\u00e0 stabiliti a monte. In particolare i nostri utenti test sono stati, per la maggior parte, in grado di portare a termine le operazioni richieste, quali: 1. Consultare una cartella clinica, 2.

Is usually delegated to the patients the duty of providing the accurate information about their health condition every visit.\n\n\n\tThe missing digitalization of the gathered health data and the consequent discontinuity of the healing process.\n\n\n\tThe limited precision of the anamnestic research due to the high number of patients and the short time available.\n\n\n\n\n\tFinal User, individuals and\u00a0community target\n\n\n\n\nResQ is conceived to ease the communication among physicians (involved in critical context such as emergency hospitals and refugees reception centers) regarding the health state of foreigner patients who don\u2019t know the language of the hosting country. In this way, the tool is designed for physicians, but the main benefits will come for migrating patients whose this services is dedicated to.\n\n\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/embed/MZSMi316E-Y\n\n\n\n\n\tSolution, brief description of the project\n\n\n\n\nResQ is a mobile management tool that improves the communication among healthcare workers (especially physicians, but also volunteers, nurses etc etc...), getting as a result the reduction of the language barrier that very often doesn\u2019t allow foreign patient to fully explain their symptoms or their own pathologies.\n\nThe personal pathological condition besides being a psychological kind of weight, for instance when a patient has to explain multiple times his/her condition to a series of different medical specialists, it could also lead to misinterpretation and diagnosis issues when there might be a language barrier.\n\nResQ is conceived to to be used mainly during the period in which the migrant still doesn\u2019t own a \u201cCodice Fiscale\u201d (personal unique fiscal code), but only a STP card (Straniero Temporaneamente Presente), that makes her/ him able to benefit from the main national healthcare services (for 12 months maximum).\n\nThe reception centers that provide the STP card and give the first medical assistance, have to deal with a very high number of people in a stressful situation that often lead to a superficial treatment.\n\nIn this way we designed an agile gathering data tool that saves time and in few minutes would be able to fulfill a complete health history of the patients. Also, the digitalization of such a document would make possible an extensive sharing with colleagues that later will take care of the same patient.\n\nTherefore the physician will have the chance to communicate autonomously among themselves without misunderstanding through the management tool.\n\n\nResQ-board.jpg2045x2500 640 KB\n\n\n\n\n\n\tTechnologies we will adopt\n\n\n\n\nThe tool we are designing will be developed in order to be accessible from the main devices available on the market. Therefore we envision applications possibly developed in their native languages as Java or Android and Objective-C foe iOS ambients.\n\nEven though we believe a mobile tool might be most suitable solution for the specific usage context we are working on, we would like to provide also a multi-platform responsive app developed in HTML5.\n\nThe cloud service might be developed in NodeJS, with database in MongoDB and MySQL.\n\n\n\n\n\tWebsite", "created_at": "2017-11-28 17:54:35.509982", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:31:36.079071", "tag_id": 936, "post_id": 866, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 833}, {"id": 12737, "text": "", "quote": "[@Noemi\u2019s note] I was happy to connect with Emma Jones, who is in her words, a third of the We Mental Health Nurses team at WeCommunities, along with Vanessa Garrity and Mark Brown. This story serves as a first encounter with Edgeryders. It also includes written reflections by Vanessa.\n\nWeMHNurses hosts regular mental health themed twitter chats, as part of a network chat calendar, with wildly diverse topics ranging from \u201cThe use of digital technology in everyday practice\u201d to \u201cWorkplace democracy in mental health\u201d. The core team runs the day to day operations, on a purely voluntary basis, with the WeMHNurses account, also linking into the wider WeCommunities, which covers many different branches of Nursing and Health Care professions and specialism. Topics for chats tend to mostly emerge from topical conversations within the community or where there is, for example a national policy directive or key piece of published journalism relating to mental health. The community also run sponsored chats for national bodies such as the Dept of Health, Care Quality Commission and NHS England. The WeMHNurses team see their role as being about facilitating broader conversation in a democratised digital space, where everyone can have a voice, regardless of positional authority. The team also see their role as being to make national policy more accessible, in terms of the language being used. The community also has a particular focus on discussing the everyday implications of policy on mental health nursing practice.\n\nThe chats are generally facilitated by one of the @WeMHNurses team, with guests are often invited to participate in the chat where the person brings specific expertise to the conversation. This is an open process, whereby anyone can contact the team to suggest a chat topic or to ask to host a chat.The team provide support to individuals who want to host a chat from the @WeMHNurses Twitter handle.\n\nOur ethos is very much that \u201cyour opinion matters\u201d and we focus on the user point of view, getting people talking to each other and bringing a variety of perspectives to the conversation. We enjoy working with people who have previously been in services or are currently in services because we really value the lived experience perspective. As we are an independent voice, we will also cover topics that might be considered controversial, political or critical, as we believe that these conversations are important in setting the future direction for mental health nursing.\n\nOn reflection, we think that the liveliest and most informative chats are often where there is a real mixture of perspectives, including for example, clinicians, people accessing services, managers, leaders, academics, researchers and policy makers. The conversations that we have online are often very powerful for this reason as we can\u2019t think of many examples from our own professional lives, where there has been such a variety of voices in a room to debate a topic in such a level and democratic way. An example of this is a chat that Vanessa and Mark ran with the Health Service Journal, where we discussed the reduction of inpatient mental health beds across the country. This chat was very much brought to life by people sharing their experiences of how this impacted on them personally when they needed to access inpatient care.\n\nThe demographics for our chat suggest that we have a largely UK audience. However, because of the global reach of Twitter, we do have some international representation within our community and we love to encourage this because of the dimension that it brings to the conversation\n\nBefore we run a chat, we produce some pre chat information on the wecommunities website. This is generally written in a blog style, so it is broadly accessible reading. We are also looking at how we can make our chats even more inclusive, such as by providing audio for people who struggle to read or who have visual impairment. The challenge for us is that we are all volunteers, so we have to find ways of delivering information quickly.\n\nHow come this twitter format for talking about mental health? Is there something in the medium that helps learning, or alleviation for individuals?\n\nAs with everything there are always pros and cons. Some would say \u201cthere\u2019s only so many characters on twitter\u201d and mental health can be a very complex topic to discuss with limited characters, especially when people are talking about personal experience. On the other hand, it can help you be more focused and concise in what you are trying to say.\n\nI suppose using twitter to talk about mental health is quite personal, as is twitter use in general. There are many who find it hugely therapeutic and helpful, either getting involved in chats, communicating/ networking with others or for gaining support. It is a fab place for the sharing of information, including research and it's also a great forum for challenging stigma and moving the mental health agenda forward.\n\n\nWeMHNurses1_0.png900x480 120 KB\n\n\nWordcloud from\u00a0participants twitter bios in a recent chat -\u00a0source.\n\nIs there a cutoff number for participants in a chat? Or a number that makes it effective? I\u2019m wondering because you have such high regularity - every week.\n\nThere is not a maximum number of people in each chat, it can be anybody using the hashtag. Often people pop into the chat with just one or two tweets, whilst at the same time, we are having a conversation with other people, who participate in the entirety of the chat. When you are facilitating a chat, which is busy, it can be a challenge responding to every single tweet, but we do try to do this and often we find that people branch off and have separate conversations with other participants, within the chat, which goes down a different path to the structured questions of the main chat. Providing they still use the hashtag, we still capture this conversation in the transcript at the end. This is an example of the latest archived chat on a Tuesday evening, counting 133 contributors, 1200 tweets and with a reach of 7,561,098! This was a joint chat with @wenurses and @weldnurses.\n\nWith our over 6000 followers, plus the wider network, I suppose it is hard to say how many people we reach constantly. However, analytics for the chat are captured within the wecommunities website. Nick Chinn is the technical person behind this at Wecommunities.\n\nWhat do you think draws people in? What makes it a community for you? Is it people interacting with each other, learning, figuring out stuff?\n\nI suppose it is all of that. Everyone involved in the chats is interested in that particular area and that shared interest drives the discussions and questions in the chat, which will often support the development of links between people. Often people in the chats might say: \u2018this is a good chat\u2019, and \u2018why don\u2019t we do one on this other topic area?\u2019 It then keeps expanding, and there are more things that we get involved in. So, in essence, the community is about sharing knowledge and learning, being open to thinking in different ways and developing a support network as well.\n\nWhat for the future and how can we support your work?\n\nWe are\u00a0very aware that people establish relationships and friendships offline with people who they have connected with on Twitter and that these relationships are often a great source of strength and support for people. Vanessa and Teresa Chinn, Founder of WeCommunities organised an unConference earlier in the year, through crowdfunding, which brought together 300 people from the community into a physical space to get together and to debate and discuss the future direction of social media in health care. We also provided a parallel online agenda throughout the day, so that the twitter community could still very much be part of it, even if they couldn\u2019t physically attend. Vanessa and Mark from WeMHNurses and Mental Elf on Twitter are also in the process of setting up a Digital mental health conference service, which we are launching at #PDDigital16 later in November.", "created_at": "2017-11-28 17:55:24.319021", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:31:36.121633", "tag_id": 941, "post_id": 551, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 518}, {"id": 12724, "text": "", "quote": "UnMonastery in Cairo", "created_at": "2017-11-28 17:49:10.052078", "updated_at": "2017-12-02 16:05:41.255353", "tag_id": 2757, "post_id": 1239, "creator_id": 4180, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 1206}, {"id": 12725, "text": "", "quote": "waste management", "created_at": "2017-11-28 17:49:23.376353", "updated_at": "2017-12-02 16:05:41.263837", "tag_id": 2758, "post_id": 1239, "creator_id": 4180, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 1206}, {"id": 12726, "text": "", "quote": "electricity shortage", "created_at": "2017-11-28 17:49:29.741773", "updated_at": "2017-12-02 16:05:41.272932", "tag_id": 2759, "post_id": 1239, "creator_id": 4180, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 1206}, {"id": 12728, "text": "", "quote": "unPiligrimage", "created_at": "2017-11-28 17:50:52.826629", "updated_at": "2017-12-02 16:05:41.281498", "tag_id": 2760, "post_id": 27931, "creator_id": 4180, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 1206}, {"id": 12729, "text": "", "quote": "Afrilab's (20 Hubs across Africa) network", "created_at": "2017-11-28 17:51:09.008749", "updated_at": "2017-12-02 16:05:41.291302", "tag_id": 2761, "post_id": 28503, "creator_id": 4180, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 1206}, {"id": 12730, "text": "", "quote": "Hackers", "created_at": "2017-11-28 17:51:14.827896", "updated_at": "2017-12-02 16:05:41.295936", "tag_id": 2618, "post_id": 28503, "creator_id": 4180, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 1206}, {"id": 12733, "text": "", "quote": "thermal energy", "created_at": "2017-11-28 17:52:41.245843", "updated_at": "2017-12-02 16:05:41.304487", "tag_id": 2762, "post_id": 3491, "creator_id": 4180, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 3458}, {"id": 12734, "text": "", "quote": "paper pelletizer machine", "created_at": "2017-11-28 17:53:10.438219", "updated_at": "2017-12-02 16:05:41.314665", "tag_id": 2763, "post_id": 3491, "creator_id": 4180, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 3458}, {"id": 12738, "text": "", "quote": "dreamhamar", "created_at": "2017-11-28 17:55:25.183532", "updated_at": "2017-12-02 16:05:41.194194", "tag_id": 2751, "post_id": 1873, "creator_id": 4180, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 1840}, {"id": 12739, "text": "", "quote": "network design process", "created_at": "2017-11-28 17:55:37.169758", "updated_at": "2017-12-02 16:05:41.176823", "tag_id": 2749, "post_id": 1873, "creator_id": 4180, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 1840}, {"id": 27008, "text": "", "quote": "This is a very narrow view of the problems that can arise when optimization systems are applied in the public sector.

Poland most likely is the only country in the world that had abortions legal by law (1956-1993) and changed it \"backward\".\u00a0We ended up having one of the most restrictive laws in the world, and the legislators were smart, by\u00a0avoiding criminalizing women (with whom society would sympathize) and focusing instead on everyone else who assists with abortions (the penalties are up to 8 years in prison), creating a system of fear and paranoia.\u00a0\nThe first thing that strikes\u00a0about abortion in Poland is the statistics - according to Polish Ministry of Health in 2013, there were 744 legal abortions and 718 of them due to the risk of birth defects. 3 of them due to rape and 23 due to the risk posed to women health. In 2015 there were 1044 legal abortions. For a country with 38 million inhabitants, these numbers seem just wrong. In Spain or UK, these numbers are 200 or 400 times higher. And it's estimated that illegal abortions every year account for between 80.000- 200.000 cases in Poland.\u00a0\nSo, what kind of abortions are available in the underground and how do women access it?\nChirurgical abortions are one of the common ways. They\u00a0usually happen in\u00a0hidden spaces, often barely up to any standards, with basic equipment, sometimes only in the presence of doctor (women who come to get the abortion might end up assisting them). The price of an abortion is at least\u00a02000 zl (500 euros), and it tends to go up with the standard. In some cases, when doctors are well connected, they can even perform them in hospitals, which would double the price. Many doctors who refused to perform a legal abortion are perfectly fine with doing it illegally after settling the price with their patients.\u00a0\nConsidering that the minimal wage in Poland is 1850 zl, and the average is 4000 (yet many people struggle to get contracts, work on 3/4 of full time, or often work on irregular gigs earning even less than 1000 z\u0142 a month with no minimal wage per hour), the price is quite prohibitive and exclusive. Many women end up taking\u00a0loans to pay off their abortions.\u00a0\nNowadays, women contact pro-choice organizations to find out\u00a0who can help them with abortion. Since the 90ties, press and internet advertisements were the ways to find\u00a0doctors who'd perform them. Such services would be named as \"painless restoration of menstruation\"\u00a0- and involve either chirurgical help or access to drugs, highly overpriced. In many cases a friend or a relative knows who does it in your town. The fear and paranoia remain anyhow - women are asked to leave the clinic right after the procedure is done, regardless of their condition, in order not to bring suspicion. They're asked to park their cars far away from the place of appointment.\u00a0\nSome of the informal groups specialize in organizing abortions abroad. Ciocia Basia, a group of volunteer activist, helps to organize legal abortions in Berlin. For a price of 290/390 euros, they arrange pharmacological and chirurgical abortions in clinics, help with translations and offer a couch for the women coming over. Another popular destination is Slovakia and Czech Republic - it's super easy to find websites in Poland of clinics in these countries that provide with professional and anonymous help. Prices are similar to those in Polish underground.\nAnd then you have the pharmacological abortion. There are two drugs containing\u00a0misoprostol registered and available in Poland, one of which can be bought without the prescription. Women usually end up making up stories about stomach pain or rheumatic grandmothers to buy them. Sometimes both of them can be obtained from \"under the counter\", forums also advise to ask a man to help\u00a0buy them. Misoprostol should be accompanied by mifepristone to increase effectiveness (the combination of both has 98% effectiveness, while only misoprostol alone is between 80-90%), but the latter drug is not registered in Poland. In this case organizations such as Women on Waves help to buy and ship\u00a0them from other countries (they ask for donation of minimum of 70 euros, but they do support women in economic difficulties by providing them for free). It is well known that some of the doctors write prescriptions for these drugs (a pack of 12 costs 25 zl, but can be sold 10 or more times more expensive on the black market) and help women get access to them via advertisements. It's impossible to track as these drugs are not refunded by the state - therefore not registered anywhere.\u00a0\nDue to lack of widespread support, some of the women organize support groups on online forums. They look for other women who seek\u00a0abortions or just had one, share their stories\u00a0and explain to each other what happens to their bodies, how to access drugs, if nausea is a normal reaction to pills, etc. As in some cases, pharmacological abortion can lead to prolonged bleeding and even death, they offer each other a call of support during the abortion, which takes up to a day. It's recommended to call for an ambulance in case of emergency - doctors cannot tell if the miscarriage was illegally inducted or not, and that save\u00a0lives in some\u00a0instances of home abortions.\u00a0\nI am still reading some more about the abortion underground in Poland, and if I find some more interesting facts, I will updated this text.

Probably after decades of liberal regulations to some extent women are aware of the fact that abortions are needed, but catholic brainwashing has been so effective, that they're trapped between the moral and the pragmatic views on abortion. Now what seems to prove this is that women are not interested in lobbying for their right to abortion - they somehow agree to comply with the rules by having them underground and accepting the stigma, rather than fighting\u00a0for their rights. Imagine even if the lowest estimate of 80.000 women having illegal abortions a year is right, and 10 percent of them would be up to fight with the system on that, we'd have a pretty great leverage to change the law by now. But we don't. have that. Well, at least until now - but this remains to be seen because we also have a conservative revival going on and if the church steps in, you never know who'd stay on top of things.

This led straight into individual and collective reflection and the mapping of questions that mattered to participants. Here, three key issues emerged, which participants gathered in three working groups to address.\nOne group tackled the question of \"How can we provide care and preventative care adequately and accessibly?\" in a process of collective brainstorming and idea development. As a central starting point was the agreement that care and prevention services should be provided by real people for real people, and thus to counteract the further dehumanization in care - both toward those being cared for, but also the caregivers themselves, as has been spreading as a result of the savings and efficiency measures, particularly in the public sector care, such as hospitals and nursing homes,. Based on this arose an idea for central, physical places and spaces in which cross-generational knowledge sharing communities with a decentralized \"bottom-up\" structure can develop. This should activate the local community at large and encourage more people to visit and thus bringing them together. Simultaneously, through the use of modern telecommunications and the Internet, communities that are located in remote areas will be included \u2013 the challenge of inadequate or even non-existent Internet connections in these areas could be countered by open-source technology solutions, such as balloons that are equipped with Internet. The necessary financial resources could be generated by a crowdfunding campaign, also to generate more public attention, especially online, for teaching/learning/exchange spaces for this innovation and strengthen the cohesion of the existing community. A key component of the engagement in these areas could be workshops of all types and themes to be organized, offered and held by participants themselves. These spaces could make a contribution to the initial formulation of questions, because a social community that is open and accessible for all faces the challenge of accessibility to prevention and care, supported by the Internet. Care and prevention again become a matter for the community, and are thus realized in a humane and proportionate way.\nThis common \"bottom-up\" structure was made tangible in a first prototyping, which opened the question \"How can we engage individuals to support these structures, even if they ostensibly do not (yet) benefit from them?\"\nThe prototype incorporated the approach of small and relatively autonomous systems where the supply and demand of communities for health and social themes can not only be met, but also that such knowledge can be bundled onsite and via the internet everyone has access to the spaces. Decisions about the design of health promoting coexistence are shaped by the particpating actors themselves. Finally, assumptions were formulated, which should be examined, scrutinized and discussed in the network in order to make this approach more effective and more efficient. Because even subtle or unconscious perceptions and attitudes can potentially be found in each concept, it needs to be balanced by many, diverse and also conflicting perspectives on the concept to make it more resistant. It was also reflected that a certain basic attitude is required of all potential participants to form these care and prevention networks. Another important point is posed by the question of: \"How can momentum be created for these spaces and networks?\"\nAnother group addressed the question of: \"How can we, based on commonalities, learn more from each other?\" In a idea development and brainstorming process on this issue, the importance of local and personal interaction was recognized. This includes the networking of stakeholders and users, potentially through an interactive map on the Internet such as used by www.berlinimwandel.de. It also requires the organizing of engaging workshops where actors can share their enthusiasm for relevant topics with others by presenting them as relevant themes, and optionally also to demonstrate activities to make them tangible. In addition, activities such as role reversals to expand the individuals' horizons of experience are possible, as is done, for example, in working with \"age suits\" \u2013 young people slip into full-body suits equipped with weights to enable the experience of having an aged body.\nIn a first prototype lifting the existing resources were, theoretically and practically, visualized through a mapping of individual and collaborative networking, both online and offline and person. This process led to the realization that everything is actually there to the realization of this idea already what is needed, when the dedicated actors gathered as OPENandChange workshop, work together and share their resources and combine theory with practice. These assumptions to check it seems important in the first step to begin with themselves, so to make the possibility of designing a different world tangible. This iterative process leads to fresh insights. But the community-based approach not only leads to new insights, but can lead to a higher incidence of fun and joy, and ultimately health and well-being by strengthening group working experiences.\nThe third working group focused on the question: \"How can we increase the societal appreciation for a public welfare oriented social system?\" Also during this idea development and brainstorming process, the need for people to meet in person in \"their\" area, city, country was emphasized. For example, working in interactive groups can lead to an intensification of togetherness and can make prevention and care topic. The supposedly negative connotations otherwise associated with these concepts such as disease, death and a feeling of helplessness are thus transformed. A positive attitude towards the subject is promoted, fears can be reduced, and at the same time the respect and appreciation for the work of nurses and caregivers is increased. In particular, a playful approach to the subject can support this project and convey the idea that all can benefit. Another important aspect for answering the initial question is to explore the current actual situation in care. The question as to why the appreciation in prevention and care sector is so low can lead to valuable information to help find solutions. In prototyping, the motto of \"living appreciation\" was made tangible and concrete: Care and prevention spaces would be established in the middle of society, fulfilling the basic needs of all, which ensures the participation of all so that this approach corresponds to the wishes of all and fulfills their needs. To test this assumption requires a thorough basic research of existing resources, as well as bureaucratic hurdles, and to examine stakeholders, especially those who are not participating.\nBased on the work of the three groups, the following definition of the problems was generated:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Dehumanization of health and social systems \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The focus on treating symptoms rather than promoting healthy lifestyles \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Privatization and capitalization of public goods, which should be accessible to all \nThe concrete solution that the participants collectively devised, states that:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0All we need is there if we work together and share our resources\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0A paradigm shift is needed: \"From Pathogenesis to Salutogenesis\" \u2013 Solidary Health Promotion System with Global Knowledge Network and Local Action Spaces \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Working \"with people for people\" and connect visionaries, experts, institutions and places through concrete actions \nThis solution leads to the following intended:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Employing existing treasures: Mapping for individual and community networking, online and in person, in theory and practice \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Practising appreciation: Create care and prevention spaces in the middle of society to fulfill the basic needs of all and create new incentive/recognition structures in the long term \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Local systemic change: Developing new skills, resources and infrastructure that can be used by all of us: children, young people, adults, seniors (people in all phases of life). \nStrong arguments for the proposal are:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Bottom-up structure with small relatively autonomous systems, who self-regulate the supply and demand of health and social services for individuals and communities \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Only through shared ownership effectiveness and sustainability can this be secured \nOur approaches, technologies and tactics are:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Active participation of ALL leads to a prototype that works for the majority and meets their needs (human-centered development of global platform and local spaces) \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Collective, iterative structure combining theory and practice \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Global Knowledge Network \u2013 CAREPEDIA: bundled knowledge (Internet / platform) all have access to the \"central office\" \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Local Action Spaces: Locally designed and managed spaces for health-promoting coexistence \"From Pathogenesis to Salutogenesis\"\nWe believe our solution will work because: We have existing needs (more than 80% of people want a functional and appreciative system for care and prevention ) and real effects from a dehumanized health and care system. We know many people and institutions that are interested in cooperating and who would gladly contribute their respective expertise. Another world is within reach. There are many projects and movements to prove it. We shall make this even more visible. Everything we need is already there. We need the courage to try it, to experience and live it. We can make an active contribution to this. Financial resources are not a challenge or necessity to achieve this.\nAs expected results \u2013 in the context of existing cases \u2013 we use the following examples: Successful EcoVillages such as Mondragon (a community in the Basque Country without police). Giving spaces, exchange meets and free shops. Micro-agriculture in the city. Urban gardening. Community-supported agriculture creates new relationships between city and land. There are urban farming initiatives in Detroit, critical consumption movements in Italy (GAS), alternative currency systems such as WIR in Switzerland, and solidarity networks for food supply and health clinics in Greece, as well as Networks such as SOLIDAGO and Artabana in Germany. And many more.\nFurthermore, our proposal is confirmed by literature and scientific consensus such as in the field of neuronal research: Fear paralyzes reason and creativity and leads to depression due to stress and alienation . Yet willingness for lifelong learning, creates new neural connections. Further scientific findings such as the Hierarchy of Needs Maslow, the concept of The Ever-Present Origin (Stuttgart 1949-1953) by Jean Gebser, the classic theories of J.M. Baldwin, G.H. Mead, J. Piaget (The Psychology of the Child) and L. Kohlberg as well as related work by C. Gilligan, F. Oser and M. Parsons. Also the literature and research by Ken Wilber, Aurobindo Ghose, Ervin L\u00e1szl\u00f3, Don Beck, and Michael Murphy; \u00a0work on Emotional Intelligence by Daniel Goleman, und the research by Kropotkin, who proved that cooperation is more important than competition in the animal kingdom and is effective for the survival of the group. Also the ample literature on the topics of sustainable lifestyles, Solidarity economy, Holacracy and Sociocracy support our suggested solution.\nHowever, it is necessary to keep sight of the risks. Here there are also a number of examples that could occur either externally or internally: The risk that corporations hijack the ideas and commercialize them, such as happened with Carsharing and CoLiving. External factors such as war, social conflicts, the collapse of the financial system, climate change and its consequences, privatization of public goods such as drinking water, and environmental disasters could endanger our plans.\nBut also our inner monsters, such as greed and the hunger for power \u00a0could torpedo the project. There is always a danger that the idea is not accepted, that the needs of the stakeholders are not met or met only partially; that there are \"too many cooks\" or that the concept can not be implemented due to conflicting priorities, or dependencies between partners and networks arise.\nYet we see possibilities to work against these risks. Reality has proven that it already works, and many people are working toward this aim worldwide:\nWe are many! We cooperate and we are a network. We have sufficient human capacity. Our approach is flexible and can be used in existing structures and institutions. Dependence on existing systems and infrastructures can be solved via an \"open-source\" approach that leads to a multiplying effect, where copying is allowed and actively encouraged.\nThis leads to the reduction of fears, relaxation, deceleration, satisfaction and happiness. There will be systemic relief or elimination of the superfluous, as well as personal and societal development potential through inclusion and the integration of \"fringe groups\" such as unemployed, refugees or marginalized citizens.\nFor evaluation it is intended to study these criteria and assumptions in order to confirm them: Self-organization in groups works. Positions, attitudes and values are part of a common vision. Skills are included and allocated according to an open source principle.

In your rural development example, I see that they worked through offline meetings, convened in cities and on weekdays at 11.00 am. That choice is going to prevent the most interesting potential participants (the local entrepreneur, the teacher, the parent of small children...) from showing up. People who reliably do show up are the people paid to participate, like representatives and lobbyists... but those already have channels to talk to the government. The other option would be to convene during the evenings, but, at least in Italy, civil servants do not like this at all. The option is almost never even discussed. So, most of the collective brainpower is ruled out before the process even starts.\nThe \"technology of participation\" (the town hall meeting) is non-scalable. This means (a) every participant\u00a0will spend most of her\u00a0time being talked to and (b) people will need to keep any intervention short. This means there is no time to explore issues and scenarios. This is why I like so much online forums like Edgeryders: you can participate in your own time (when you are off work, when your children are asleep...); take time to make your case; and no one is forced to be reading anyone else. We\u00a0choose\u00a0to engage with contributions we find interesting.\nThe social contract underpinning participation is often not clear. I participate, then what? What we suggest gets implemented? What we suggest gets considered? How do I know decisions have not been made beforehands, and the decision maker ris just looking for a rubberstamp? Recent example: after an online and offline consultation with 1.8\u00a0million\u00a0participants on Italian schools, number 1 request that emerged was to have teachers evaluated by independent experts, and not by their own headmasters. The government, nevertheless, decided to reject that request. Assuming the average participants spent two hours participating (very conservative assumption), that means the waste of 3.6 million hours. In European standards (1,732 productive hours in a year), that the equivalent of about\u00a02,000 years of human work. Not cool. The social contract issue is the easiest one to fix.\n\nI have recently been involved in contributing to Italy's 3rd action plan under the Open Government Partnership (as an activist, unpaid). My brothers-and-sisters-in-arms and myself made these points quite forcefully, and they have been adopted by the government.

It was never simply a \"I want KFC and I shall buy KFC\".

Let me say that 2 years ago I started spending some time with them, to enquire about their daily challenges, and to shadow some of them (who kindly volunteered) during their daily routines, I had conceived this as any other didactic activity of my university education, excitingly on the field, but not more special\u2026 how wrong could I have been!\nLong story short, I had reached out as part of a design thinking exercise, after brainstorming with my colleagues over social and technical literature to find solutions to the challenge of blind people navigation through living environments, \u201csimply\u201d to extract narratives about what we thought their problem to be and, thus, tune our solutions\u2026 We had succeeded obtaining the information we wanted, we had lists of the defeating features of currently existing solutions, descriptions of use cases, but while working on the desired features, something started to emerge for some of us in the team: another narrative had been seeping through our conversations with the blind volunteers, that we did not consider in advance. Most of the blind people we had talked to, despite agreeing to the obstacles imposed by visual impairment, did not consider that a defining condition and were rather cold to any assistive technology they tested or we described. Instead, narratives of empowerment, education, disintermediation, were flowing through most of their replies, even when our conversations were explicitly biased towards solutions\u201d.\nLet this sink for a moment. And remember that the number one challenge of helping another person is falling in love with the solution one wants to offer, losing sight of the\u00a0person\u00a0in exchange for the\u00a0problem.\nSo we asked Irene to recollect her most significant conversation for us:\nIL (Irene Lanza): \u201cGood morning Maria[\u00a0I would like to thank you already for your time\u2026 it is truly precious to me to be able to talk with you\u201d\nMBC (Mother of an 11years old blind child): \u201cGood morning Irene. I have heard about you from my friends and fellows from the blind union\u2026 they say you are a very polite and smart girl\u201d\nIL: \u201cAww\u2026 how much will they ask me to pay, now? \u2026haha\u201d\nMBC: \u201chaha\u201d\nIL: \u201cDid they also already tell you about what I would like to talk today?\u201d\nMBC: \u201cvaguely\u2026 apparently, you are working on a new technology to assist blind people in their daily life\u2026?\u201d\nIL: \u201cThat is fairly accurate, but luckily they did not spoil our fun by letting you in too many details. In facts, we are working at the proof-of-concept of a wearable device that could analyze the surroundings in real time and feed information about objects, their velocities, and positions to a visually impaired user, to allow him/her moving naturally through a living environment\u2026 our challenge is to allow a blind person to play a football game competitively against people with normal vision\u2026 well, we would still not provide talent though\u201d\nMBC: \u201cSo, are you thinking of something like those apps on the smartphones?\u201d\nIL: \u201cWell, not really\u2026 we would have dedicated hardware, and we would like to collect your opinions about how to design the user interface\u2026 a smartphone app would be a proof-of-concept compared to the kind of product design we are pursuing\u201d\nMBC: \u201cI don\u2019t like this kind of assistive technology much\u2026 you never know it will let you down. So many factors: the signal may be lost, the battery may go down, the app could crash\u2026 what should I do then?\u201d\nIL: \u201cThis is exactly what I am here to listen to\u2026 you see, we will collect all these opinions, and try to prioritize features in our design concept\u2026 so, have you already tried some of those?\u201d\nMBC: \u201cI am constantly exploring and searching for new tricks and tools that could help Mario, so I often talk about this topic with my friends at the union, and I try some them after reading their reviews or hearing their presentations. Most of them are quite far away from real life, for they are very specialized on single use cases, and they rely on infrastructural investments that in our Country are stagnating for too long already. Mario\u2019s problems extend well beyond walking through an airport or a shopping mall or reading the label on a tomato can. The only tool I really find useful is the reader with vocal synthesis on the smartphone: it works pretty well and it\u2019s so precious to be able to listen to any book when audiobooks are still not the norm\u2026\u201d\nIL: \u201cSo could you tell me more about Mario\u2019s experience? What do you think are the most commonplace barriers he experiences when going to school? How does he roam around?\u201d\nMBC: \u201cHe is training with the stick. Many people dislike it, but it is rather dependable and attracts sufficient attention to ensure that other people will be more cooperative and safely behaved. However everyday life can become very problematic. Architectures are often hiding traps that would surprise for the naivety of those who designed the spaces: you would never imagine the feeling of dread when you have just seen your son missing an unprotected element from a window, protruding out of a wall with its sharp corners\u2026 and the use of the spaces themselves can be even more challenging! Hanging wires, doors opening directly on stairs, elements built in non-shock-resistant glass. Many of these, if you ask me, would be dangerous to any child, but if you factor in the inability to forecast what you are going to meet next\u2026 The risk of bad practices escalates quickly!\u201d\nIL: \u201cSo school is not a safe haven for Mario\u2026?\u201d\nMBC: \u201cNot just that\u2026 most activities are not structured to include children like Mario. Schoolbooks are more difficult to find as eBooks for the vocal synthesizer than others. Even then, many graphics, whether didactic or there for testing purposes, remain inaccessible\u2026 and even the teachers, despite being adorable with Mario, are not informed about methods for inclusive teaching\u2026 For example, my husband is a musician, and he has always tried to exploit musical theory to organize our family games (she mocks for me a couple of games based on recognizing the tones, or what an object at home could be based on analogies of noises). We constantly try to use acoustics as a tool to explain concepts, and risks to our child\u2026\u201d\nIL: \u201c\u2026and this, of course, doesn\u2019t happen at school\u201d\nMBC: \u201cNot even closely. School sometimes becomes a very frustrating experience\u2026 a place of isolation to remind Mario of his diversity. Irene, you are young, you must remember your lectures of geometry, for example\u2026\u201d\nIL: \u201cyes, indeed\u2026 mostly graphics are drawn on the blackboard\u2026 I see what you mean\u201d\nMBC: \u201ceven our language is geared for the idea that\u00a0seeing is believing. Mario often tells me that he has seen a schoolmate with a certain outfit or some event that he is going to tell me about\u2026 he does enormously to find his place in society. And my husband and I do our maximum to help him surpass the social barriers: we teach him games that he can play with his friends, we accompany him to familiarize with the places where he will have to interact with his mates, and we drill into him, constantly, how to react to the unexpected, hoping that panic will never prevail. Technology, instead of these half-baked attempts at substituting vision for simple tasks, should take on education\u2026 there is so much more that is lost in our societies when one cannot see than just reading on a can whether it is tomato or green peas, and nurturing those skills that we all have as fellow humans, rather than focusing on what we lack, would be so much more empowering.\u201d\nIL: \u201cwhat you say is very inspirational\u2026 so you believe education is the true mean of supporting Mario\u2026 and what is the place of technology in your vision?\u201d\nMBC: \u201cwe live in a time obsessed with technology, and we forget that it is just a tool. I have not hidden from you, I am not a big supporter of the idea. For example, we use the e-reader with voice synthesizer\u2026 the problem is extremely important, but not mission critical, and so the technical solution makes sense\u2026 I am not sure I would delegate to technology, or to other humans for what is worth it, many other things on a regular base\u2026 what would be the meaning of life, if you give up on the very experiences that make it worth sharing and living? We are social animals, someone more important than me said once\u2026\u201d\nIL: \u201cMaria, thank you really for letting me peer into your family life\u2026 and thank you for your kind guidance. I hope that we will be able to live to your expectations, but I can already promise you that we will at least try our best!\u201d\nMBC: \u201cIt has been my pleasure Irene, it is so nice to meet a young person trying with enthusiasm to tackle a problem we have to deal and cope with every day. I wish you the best of luck, and I look forward to hearing about your progress!\u201d\nWhen Irene went back to the team after this conversation, she was confused, for having just experienced the most confrontational conversation about their project. Irene was moved emotionally by the passion and interest expressed by the mother. An experience that would leave her forever changed and stretched.\nWith Irene insisting, a small group of three people from the original team started diverging from the original path of designing a wearable \u201csmall world\u201d navigation system. They started brainstorming wildly about educational concepts.\nIndependently from the rest of the team, which opposed the need to bring to completion the academic assignment, they sought a new agreement with their mentor and started optimal\u00a0thinking at 360\u00ba. Using 3D ultrasound-based haptic interfaces to offer interactive geometry education or simulators for practical tasks that would completely substitute visualization for acoustic and tactile feedbacks? Most of the early ideas were dropped when their mentor, or people not involved in the team that he suggested to talk to, would object other low-tech solutions (e.g.: wooden models for 3D geometry) could deliver almost the same experience, significantly undercutting the complexities of the projects.\nIt was during this na\u00efve and intense search, that their mentor showed them a video of a blind person using tongue clicks to echolocate while biking (!!!). The rest, as they say, is history, and we will share with you a few details about the early testing in a next post\u2026 so follow us The challenges for the visually impaired are enormous, so immense are the ramifications for those now living without sight, and so exciting is the initiative on the horizon.\u00a0\n*To protect the privacy of individuals the names and identifying details have been changed. \u00a0There was a brand indicated, which we discovered is trusted among the blind community, but we do not think it is relevant here.", "created_at": "2017-06-26 14:02:29", "updated_at": "2017-06-26 14:02:29", "tag_id": 18, "post_id": 577, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 544}, {"id": 4565, "text": null, "quote": "Hi @Gehan, it's a pleasure to meet you.

We have the structural underpinnings - in the form of a common language (English dominates the EC) and technologies (social media, etc.). We have the political context in that it has become more and more clear that decisions are no longer made by our national governments for a whole range of issues. We have a clear democratic deficit (the weakness of the European parliament is well known). All this augurs well for a revolution in political action which crosses international boundaries and co-ordinates its activities. There are three movements which have to varying degrees expressed this: the Greens and more recently the Pirate Party and the Occupy Movement. Thus while the time may be ripe for revolutions, wars and other such unpleasantnesses, it may also be a opportunity for political maturity across the board, across social classes and national divides. This may sound somewhat utopian but looking at the realities of today in Europe we could just as easily tip into war (real hard war) as we could into creating trans-national political organisation with specific demands and legislative agendas.

But I don't think it's quite that simple. \"Being different\", going by a different value system, is itself entropic. Here's why: to accomplish anything, we humans need other humans. Other humans are attracted by \"successful\" (as per the dominant canon of what \"successful\" means). Moreover, we suffer from a documented psyhological bias called the halo effect, that makes us assume that success trasfers across domains. If you are a successful marathon runner, I will rate higher your\u00a0chances of starting a viable company, even though the skills involved with running marathons are not the same ones needed to run a business.

Considering the increasingly ubiquitous 3D technology, many of the medical tools can be soon printed cheaply by anyone. Small ethical pharmaceuticals will be able to produce their own medicine. And all the wealth that is sucked up from the communities will stay there, making them stronger and independent.

What is the problem/question you are trying to solve/explore?\u00a0Frame it as a design question!\nHow do the differences between family relationships influence the concept of care?\u00a0\nFamily is the space in which we learn to care about other people and in optimal situations are being care for from others. Apart from the abstract idea of a close all-loving family, the reality often looks different and a multiple of imbalances can arise within and across different families. Viewing care as a fundamental good necessary to every human being, different family structures influence the social life of people and create misunderstandings across all the ecosystem. Someone who does not, for whatever reason, have access to care from his \u201cnatural\u201d family, has to seek somewhere else, but meets the difficulty to be part of a society in which different types of care are structure and differentiated, i.e. typically hard emotional situations that need a specific type of care are dealt with the family members. Outside of these close circle, misunderstanding arise as why people should care and how to communicate the need for it.\u00a0\nDifferent family-backgrounds often produce individuals who deal with their emotional life differently. We live in a time where family relationships are being redefined and even though alternative families (single mother, single father, same gender marriages, etc.) are officially being more accepted in the open discourse, the psychological and practical implications are being overlooked. For example, turning your friend or lover into the main care giver\u2014role officially being taken by your parents and/or brother/sisters\u2014still carries social stigmas and difficulties in assessing the fluid role-relationship in play.\u00a0\n2. State the ultimate impact you would like to have. What would make you feel like you did something meaningful with your time?\nRe-think the traditional role of the family as a protection-space and care-giver; deconstruct its traditional proposes and definitions and underpin the imbalances, paradoxes, holes in the system. Center care as an extremely important aspect of our lives, a fundamental good which can have a domino-effect on all other aspects of our lives when not dealt with properly. Create a common linguistic understanding of different family backgrounds and correlate them to the psychological and social implications they carry out. Care is a fluid good and can be shared without the traditional format of a family.\n3. What are some possible solutions to your problems or ways to answer your question? Think broadly. It's fine to start a project/learning process with a hunch or two, but make sure you allow for surprises.\nThe definition of family might be broaden or the caring role and relationship be redefined. At the end, the important aspect is to awaken a conscious thinking about caring and its connection to vital energy, well-being and social possibility with other people. The intimacy by which we hide some aspects of our emotional life must be addressed with the hope a post-traditional exchange system can born out of it.\n4. Write down some of the context and constraints that you are facing. They could be geographic, technological, time-based, or have to do with the population yo're trying to reach.\nInitially the question should be limited geographically and anthropologically to the western world.

In Germany alone, 4 million people are affected by issues like anxiety or depression. Yet, it\u2019s a secret we all share. Seeking help for psychological struggles is still strongly associated with shame. Even being sad or stressed or unproductive is seen as personal weakness.

Most people that are in emotional distress don\u2019t decide to seek help until they have been in increasing pain for a prolonged amount of time.

I call it the \u201cGallery of Angels\u201d. It\u2019s a dream space to have my own semi-permanent solo show.\n\u00a0I fell in love early in life and built a little purple cottage in the countryside of Galway. \u00a0Lorraine and I got married and had two wonderful boys, Jaeden and Zach.\nMy twin Ivan, a sculptor now living in Whales, and I as young artists took on spaces for exhibitions because we didn't want to charge extra to clients as in commercial galleries. I was always interested in spaces, and ended up building my second home as well, with a purpose built Montessori school which I ran with my wife Lorraine. I took care of the project management and the arty play part. I feel some choose our school because there was a male influence and contribution, and feel it helped with some of the more distant relationships between some hard working fathers and their kids.\nWhile working on other creative projects, I also developed a therapeutic painting Workshop fusing my passion, with my training and skills in NLP (Neuro Linguistic Programming) and Timeline therapy. I call it \u201cButterfly Wings\u201d. It was suddenly the time to put it into action. \u00a0I had recently separated from my wife and was seeking many new positives changes in my Life. \u00a0I started searching for a healing place to host my therapeutic workshop.\nMy grandfather used to own Cregg Castle and then was passed to my Aunt, so I thought I would visit Cregg and see what the new owners were doing with it. When I got there the Castle was in disrepair and had been sadly boarded up for 4 years.\nI contacted the new owners to see where they stood and a few months later I sent them my strong proposal where I aimed to take on the castle as is, and start an artist\u2019s residence and a cultural music venue. Thankfully they accepted my proposal and we have a great Win Win arrangement in place. I had a lot of red tape and restrictions holding things back however I\u2019ve been pretty much living my dream here at the castle for 4 amazing years. It\u2019s a perfect space /place for artists to live and work together. It certainly is for me, I love it here, so much because it just feels like the right path for me and also I got to connect with so many creative, talented people here.\u00a0 When my Aunt had the Castle as B&B with a strong\u00a0 traditional music energy here, Dusty Springfield, Sinead O Connor, Shane Mac Gowan from the Pogues, all stayed here on occasion, back in the day. Dusty wrote in the guest book, it was her special healing place.\nI\u2019ve had quite a few artists in residence over the years, come and go, and have hosted many music and cultural events, film and photo shoots, bush craft courses and other random stuff. I have now most parts of the castle as liveable again. Artists have helped me fix up spaces as and we needed them, each artist having a living/studio space and also use of the many large communal spaces. Last year I opened one room for Airbnb guests. I have many foreign visitors all year and they are all delighted to come and stay in a real Irish Castle. https://www.airbnb.ie/rooms/7479769?preview\nhttps://www.facebook.com/creggcastlefriends/?pnref=lhc\nMy Pony - Arrow, Donkey - Houdini and Cat - Pixie are a huge contribution to the positive healing energy here.\nRecently when An Ait Eile approached me about with the Monastery concept I was very interested. It was easy to see how it could map onto what my hopes and plans for the castle. So we held a PreMonastery event which was a great success. And since that I with Kashi from Cos\u00e1in, a local wellness group hosted an amazing \u201cButterfly Wings\u201d weekend. (Therapeutic Painting Workshop)\nOver the last year or so, I did a lot of work designing and fabricating two, 40ft high cube containers which I have created all on site at the Castle. My aim was firstly to create a purpose built mobile event venue and an alternative workshop space. The design includes a large indoor/outdoor space between them, with a mobile roof covering and a neat modular floor system.\u00a0\u00a0 More work is needed however to bring them to the standard required for holding events, and with the added potential as developing it further as a demo concept home. This project has me excited, motivated and inspired. I see it as a real positive alternative to the mainstream approach of building another traditional home.\u00a0 I took the opportunity to create a new start in life, moving towards a positive creative lifestyle.\u00a0 Freedom is my top Value and this approach has given me that sense of freedom to move.\u00a0\u00a0 Also it gives me the ability, to build my own home for a lot cheaper than traditional building.

I have been employed in the non profit sector as a Project Manager on various projects, after having explored and tested theatrical/drama techniques and incorporating that into Science Communication and Health Messaging. And let me tell you, I am completely motivated and inspired by this community and others toward this goal and Public Engagement.\nMy experience as a process facilitator includes various participatory methods including: photovoice, drama, collaborative/participatory video, workshop design and events design. I've resigned from my formal job in order to test additional methods which I believe have the power to stimulate dialogue, forge relationships across difference sectors and reach larger audiences in organic, fun and interactive means.\nSince resigning from my formal employment, I've begun developing concepts using Street Arts and collaborations to install live arts installations driven toward Public Engagement. Now, Public Engagement as a term itself is not void of ambiguity and misuse for the purpose of funding or green-stamping our professional works. This isn't anyone's fault as it's a field that is developing. We should strive for full participation in our works, not merely using the term as a stamp of approval. My project aims to forge relationships with very different bodies of knowledge and social status, i.e. biomedical professionals/scientists, community members and artists, all of whom I argue have equally important and necessary knowledge to combat illness, increase the status of general Public Health and, simply put, fight a battle using a full arsenal of knowledge and weapons.\u00a0\n\nAllow me to rewind, ever so slightly to paint a picture. I've previously sought to test photovoice as a participatory method by forging relationships with community members from an under-resourced community in Cape Town, South Africa, and Scientists from the University of the Western Cape. The project sought to bring these varied parties together in a participatory workshop process, after which community members were trained on DSLR cameras and instructed to capture the lived experience of food in their everyday lives. They could capture anything related but not limited to\u00a0the purchase, consumption or disposal of food. This project revolved around Cardiovascular disease and the Scientists involved were Seniors at the Cardiovascular Research Unit at the University of Stellenbosch. The array of visual material and accompanying narrative was phenomenal and utterly beautiful. It shed light on the constant negotiation of food and consumption in these communities, including the availability of food, what kind of food was deemed healthy or not, when it was suitable for food to be disposed, food as celebration and community building etc. To me, and the Scientists involved, this process unveiled knowledge on food consumption behaviour and more structural issues imposed on these communities. It was never simply a \"I want KFC and I shall buy KFC\". This food choice is always compounded by budget, compromise, available options, time of the month, etc. People are consciously and constantly negotiating and re-negotiating choices. My heart broke when a Senior member of the project sample pulled me aside mid-project and told me ...\n\"Nabeel, I've suffered from Type 2 Diabetes for 15 years. At least thats what the doctors told me. They gave me medication and send me away each month. But never before has anyone told me what Diabetes is in a way that I understand. Never before have they taken time to talk with me. But now I have these scientists in my backyard. And they can't leave until I know my body\"...\nIt's necessary to point out that even though this community has an approximate population of 100 000 it only has one superstore that either of us would immediately turn our back on. Most food products are sourced from small kiosks on the corners. Yes, I am still in shock. How and why are the most vulnerable excluded from knowledge and provision of services? An alarm bell rang in my head that I could not ignore since I resigned. We've been running projects with a very specific agenda which more often than not in the non-profit sector provides an income and life for the administering organization. The sad truth is peoples knowledge are not given the kudos and respect it desperately needs. And in this battle, that may just be our most prize weapon.\u00a0\nFastforward 8 months and I've developed a concept which: 1. aims to bring 3 very different bodies of knowledge together in a participatory,\u00a0collaborative and egalitarian process; 2. forge relationships between these traditionally-deemed exclusive fields, i.e. arts and science and; 3. test organic and participatory processes to create events and arts installations that extends this knowlege to a broader audience in a fun interactive means.\nNow. Back to my current project...\u00a0\nI have recently collaborated with the University of Cape Town's Swallowing the World project which is a curatorial project focused on the lived experience of TB. My team of graffiti artists and I joined the festival, set up 2.5 x 2.5m canvas in the middle of campus and contributed to this project on International TB Day. As the focus of the fest was on Destigmatization, we followed suit and allowed interaction between the audience and ourselves to influence or define the artpiece. A\u00a0short video of our work:\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThis project will be installed in South Africa, India and Botswana simultaneously and attempts to use culturally- and community-sensitve street art forms. As such, we are holding participatory principles as central to the success of the project as we would like to design the project trajectory, outcomes and art installations/events with all participants. You may be thinking that no Funder finds this ideal. Alas, we're all wrong. We have had alot of interaction with a potential funder who chose to view the testing phase on UCT in livetime. This live time viewing feature of our project is something we would want to function very much like Edgeryders as it allows for collaborations and creativity between individuals and entities that may not traditionally interact.\u00a0\nThis leaves me at your feet as I'd love feedback, interaction and potentially consider collaborations with not only this project but others moving forward. I'd love to work in varying contexts and establish relationships between and across scientists, community members and artists from varying countries. This will be my next step. Apart from the actual arts installations and events, as products, we will be developing a best practices publication focused on the entire project in each 3 countries. I will also carry my \"researcher\" hat for the duration of this project as I wish to study: the interaction;\u00a0immediate knowledge transfer between scientists, community members and artists; retained knowledge and overall impact. I would openly accept any suggestions or feedback...\u00a0\nFor now I continue on my mission to test community- sensitive and -relevant means of expression and trying to find ways of using those tried and tested methods as communication tools.

Parts of the river remain buried and it continues to be polluted even as it is monitored by state and federal organizations.\u00a0 My research and installation took about three years to put together, and it presented the complexity of how economy, government policies, lack of planning, lack of accessible information and climate change can dramatically erode an environmental and cultural asset while creating insafe health issues to underserved populations.\n It was during this installation that I was approached to consider doing a similar project about the Bagmati River that flows though the middle of Kathmandu, Nepal. After initial discussions with professionals, museum staff and community members in Kathmandu, it was clear that there was a great deal of interest in starting a new project investigating the Bagmati River. I was granted a residency at the Kathmandu Contemporary Arts Center a few months later, and my research began in earnest. Jason Dilworth, a colleague at the State University of New York and a graphic designer, joined the venture early in 2016 and his work has been integral to the project\u2019s success. During Jason\u2019s and my first trip to Kathmandu in March of 2016, we were able to strengthen past connections to the project while building a larger network of individuals and groups committed to improving conditions in the Kathmandu Valley and the communities outside the valley who live along the river. Support for the Bagmati River Arts Project has grown steadily from the beginning through the assistance of Hatchfund donors, travel support through SUNY Fredonia and a Burchfield Penney Art Center grant. It has continued to grow through the sales of the project\u2019s publications and the sales of my artwork.\n The Bagmati River Arts Project (http://www.bagmatiriverartproject.com/) includes exhibitions, lectures and a website that houses a project\u00a0 overview, daily of blog of research in Kathmandu, sketchbooks, data, videos and links to the project's publication and documentary:\n \n  an exhibition at the Siddhartha Art Gallery at Barbar Mahal Revisited in Kathmandu opening on November 20th, 2016. My artwork, water data from the Bagmati River and the video documentary will be presented on the second floor. The first will include artwork by Nepalese artists whose attention focuses with issues related to the Bagmati River and related health concerns in the area. We are also working with the fine art faculty and students at Kathmandu University who will be creating work related to their cultural connections to the river.\n  \u00a0a book ,Complexities of Water: Bagmati River, Nepal and Beyond, is a publication that will examine how the holiest river in Nepal became spoiled by decades of pollution and policies that did not address issues related to climate change. It\u2019s present condition is a result of is the result of government mismanagement and oversight, lack of concern for underrepresented communities who live along its banks, and extreme flooding and droughts due to climate change. Recent reports have ranked Nepal as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change due to the high rate of urbanization, unchecked industrial development, severely low water supply, high pollution levels, increasingly frequent extreme floods and droughts, predictions of worsening conditions and lack of appropriate planning to mitigate or adapt to these conditions. Reports also list Nepal as an LDC (least developed country), which indicates its potential limitations to address these issues. This project hopes to bring international attention to this issue and hopefully some support to help provide finances to assist in addressing these issues.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While examples of pollution and the effects of climate change can be found throughout Nepal, there is no better example of how bad the situation has become than what has happened to the Bagmati River. The river is the most sacred Hindu and Buddhist river in Nepal and its banks border the holiest Hindu temples and several UNESCO heritage sites. Yet, it is the most polluted river in Nepal. The Bagmati River is also a prime example of how adversely climate change can affect a community while, at the same time, highlighting the resiliency and commitment of the residents to continue the fight to mend their river. The importance of the river to the people of Nepal and residents of Kathmandu had resulted in inspiring city-wide community events that have tried to restore the sacred waters. While their efforts are admirable and have motivated government action, little has been done to mitigate climate change causes or to adapt communities to their present conditions or to future projections. The proposed book, documentary and related programming connects the science of water quality and climate change to effects of urban migration, social norms, economics, industrial development, and government policies. The book will also investigate how the river\u2019s condition has affected religious rituals and culture. The inclusion of interviews and artwork by professional artists whose work deals with the Bagmati River will provide a unique visual perspective on Kathmandu\u2019s cultural connection to the river. While the issues investigated are specific to Nepal and the Kathmandu Valley, the general causes of the pollution, degradation of the water and its connection to climate change is reflective of many rivers and communities throughout the world.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Through aesthetically-interesting and related imagery, maps, and graphs, we hope to provide a new perspective on the interconnectedness of science, economics, environmentalism, health issues and art as it relates to the complexities of clean accessible water and the related social issues.

It also will be available in the United States and sold as a way to fund other parts of this project and future projects. A link to this finished book is available on the project website (http://www.bagmatiriverartproject.com/project-publication-2/).\n  a documentary video documents the project and include interviews with water quality and health professionals, community members as well a policy maker in Kathmandu. Songs by traditional Nepalese folk singers are incorporated throughout the video including a commissioned song about the Bagmati River. A link to this finished documentary is available on the project's website (http://www.bagmatiriverartproject.com/videos/bagmati/).\n  a brochure and poster written in Nepalese will also provide important accessible scientific and health data about the river. The poster and brochures will be distributed to the communities that live along the entire length of the river in Nepal. Members of the Bagmati River Expedition 2015 team, who created a comprehensive report about the river\u2019s water quality, microinvertebrates, avian population and plastics data, have already established connections in these communities. We have worked with Sujan Chitrakar and his graphic design students in designing the posters and brochures. Sujan is the Academic Program Coordinator and an Assistant Professor for Kathmandu University\u2019s School of Art, Center for Art and Design. We will be collaborating with the students at SUNY Fredonia to finish the design of the brochure and poster.\n \n All elements of the project listed above were finished and presented at the opening of the exhibition on November 20, 2016 at the Siddhartha Gallery in Kathmandu, Nepal.\n An exciting extension to this project is to have the artwork, publication, documentary, brochures and posters tour the United States and internationally. The Burchfield Penney Art Center in Buffalo, New York is very interested in the merits of the project and they have volunteered to promote and organize the touring exhibition.Water issues are a worldwide concern and the Bagmati\u2019s perils are not unique. Our hope is that, by touring the exhibition and by combining it with site-specific exhibitions, audiences can create connections between their region and other global communities. There is a good deal that can be learned from the history of the Bagmati as well as from the grass roots efforts that created the Saturday Bagmati River clean-up program and the successful community health initiatives supported by the non-government organizations. All of these efforts has unified the underserved residents of the Kathmandu Valley to address the basic needs in their communities while creating hope and motivating government involvement.\n \u00a0\n For more information please contact alberto@albertorey.com.\n \u00a0\n \n \u00a0\n Project Leaders\n Alberto Rey \u2013 Distinguished Professor in the Department of Visual Arts and New Media at the State University of New York at Fredonia and for the past 18 years has been the Director and Founder of Children in the Stream Youth Fly fishing Program (https://albertorey.com/s-a-r-e-p-youth-fly-fishing-program/).

In this initiative, \u201cAlliance Fran\u00e7oise\u201d and CounterFoto being our strategic partners supported along with their venues.\nCase studies:\nI do believe that they are \u201cDifferently Abled\u201d and this terminology brings the positive vibe\u00a0\u00a0 and disability is at the end about our mindset and exclusion free society is important through more engagement and employment but still struggling for inclusion.

From that venture, we felt more motivated to engage them while creating a space for their income generation. After that, we initiated more activities towards arts and crafts, with a successful art exhibition at the residence of Netherlands Embassy, May 2016. We got more opportunity to interact with the creative people and one of our artists Muhammad Sohel Ahmed got the opportunity to start his career as graphics designer at \u201cRed and Orange\u201d communication ,before him it was another deaf and mute youth who bagged a job in a local advertising media, DOT3PRD, who is Shafayth Hossain Asif (23) working as a graphics designer in advertising media.\n\u00a0\nJannatul Ferdous Srity (23) another deaf and mute female artist, who worked as an intern along with a national NGO, Democracywatch.

As the head of Chancery Mr. Tanvir Kabir\u00a0 from Bangladesh High Commission in Mexico\u00a0 bought the deaf and mute artists paintings and an exhibition was held in Mexico City as well. The thing is still now the popularization of\u00a0 buying paintings and it\u2019s customers are limited, so we are focusing on more innovative design according to the demand of the market and apart from paining, we are also selling wool made products, handmade potteries and miniature arts as well through the online page of \u201cMagical Art of Silence\u201d.

So back in July, a friend from Mumbai was looking for ways to catch the garbage while it's carried in the river and before it reaches the shore, and together we found this barrier boom technology, produced locally in India by a company from Bangalore. So the tech part is solved in principle (and the barrrier can even be installed in a way that lets boats pass.) But we are at a loss how to organize people to get this thing purchased (or DIY made) installed. After reading about your approach, it seems to me that an arts and documentary project could be the missing social catalyst in a case like this. Showing people the progress they have made already, and how a river barrier is the logical next step for a lasting solution. Well, or that people stop littering, but let's be realistic for the near term", "created_at": "2017-01-06 19:42:42", "updated_at": "2017-01-06 19:42:42", "tag_id": 62, "post_id": 10812, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 719}, {"id": 4734, "text": null, "quote": "participants.

How can we explore more of our loving and creative potential as well as create a world that reflects this inner beauty and love?\u00a0\nThese are two vital questions for me and why I'm\u00a0\"Creating new realities\". There's this beautiful play between the physical world and the non-physical (spiritual), which goes beyond words and at the same time can be very simple in heart. In my experience we are learning to trust and act upon our hearts' desires and letting go of the certainties of the known. Learning to be fully into life and at the same time peacefully creating the life that's feels really good, often being unpredictable, confronting with new challenges along the way of growth. Yet, totally clear from another perspective, which is often only afterwards understood.\u00a0\nTo me there's roughly two aspects to creation, finding love and expressing it. In whatever way feels most relevant. So creating new realities is about this expression. Expressions of love, expressions of fascination, of being intrigued by a question. This passion, like life can often only be looked upon afterwards. Yet is highly stimulating during the process. At the same time, we can experience a deep peace from within. Growing and integrating. Expressing and being silent. Creating new realities requires both in my experience. Going into something, almost blindly. Being into the question, into life, almost unconsciously. Letting go of what I already know. And at the same time being fully aware of what's happening, even when I don't know where I'm going. I'm fully aware of what I'm experiencing, all of the feelings and sensations, getting to know myself. To me, creating is about holding space and love, it's also about exploring new states of being. More expansive versions of myself. Going into the unknown. Creating new realities, riding the edges, exploring new perspectives, and at the same time, taking care of each other, holding space, accepting all of yourself and everyone around you. Knowing the lows to accept the others and overcoming doubt, finding highs to thrive and create a more amazing life.\u00a0\nSo can we\u00a0do that?\nCreate new realities and find deeper love within and for each other? Can we create and hold space? Can we set up a world that's a reflection of the love and creative potential? Can we shine light on some of the systems that enslave us (like the way money is used to control us) and create new systems that support the dynamics of our potential? Can we let go of heavy concepts and perceptions such as ownership? Can we create a world that's natural and harmonious, yet inspiring and unknown? Can we co-create out of passion rather than looking for security? Can we step into the unknown and create with love? So how do we deepen the understanding of ourselves and our behaviours? And more importantly, how can we let go of everything that doesn't serve us. Can we accelerate into loving ourselves? Which techniques can we use? Which perspectives can we take? And physically how can we create lifes that actually feel inspiring and authentic?\n\nOver the last years I've been organizing several series of meetings about personal transformation and\u00a0living from the heart\u00a0(for instance;\u00a0Vrij met Geld/ Free with Money). Also I've worked and lived with changemakers communities, for instance at the Synergyhub in Rotterdam and several ecovillages/ ecocenter's, as well as intensely researched the topic of enlightenment and spiritual growth and the physical world. Over the last months I've started writing a book: Step into creation - guidebook for a co-creative universe. Recently I've started a platform \"Creating new realities\". One of the important lessons I learned is: \"you can't co-create if you don't resonate\" and \"a little shift in perspective\" is often all you need to get back into flow. When I stop resisting, things happen. \"When I let go, I know\". Behind the known is a infinite field of potential. There lies true excitement. There is infinite inspiration at our disposal. And at the same time, it's nice to play with the physical. So to make the world a reflection of our spiritual growth. To let both go hand in hand. To grow and deepen the quality of relationships and communities. To develop the society and create things that represent our love for the world and the mystery of creation. These are some of my most important reflections over my experiences. That's what I'd love to inspire and catalyze! To create realities that are infinitely inspiring and joyful.\u00a0\n\nLooking forward to co-create with you!", "created_at": "2017-05-22 18:01:11", "updated_at": "2017-05-22 18:01:11", "tag_id": 71, "post_id": 846, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 813}, {"id": 8555, "text": null, "quote": "Ever since the election in the UK I've been doing a lot of vox pop on the streets (Liverpool, Paris, Brighton) and listening to people around the question\u00a0of what do you long for in the place where you live?\u00a0I've been\u00a0trying out different ways of\u00a0leading people towards this question, either through asking about their dreamlife or asking them to imagine themeselves into a future they would like to live in. Through these talks it\u00a0came up again and again that a lot of people\u00a0really were living through enormously challenging situations and traumas\u00a0and very willing to normalise it in conversation\u00a0and shrug it off. Listening to people simply as humans without any judgements around what kind of state they were in (eg. seeing all the people I met simply as humans experiencing the world, rather than classifying some as\u00a0experiencing states that were\u00a0\"abnormal\" or could be classed as\u00a0\"mentally ill\")\u00a0felt like a helpful thing -\u00a0the urge to have one's experience understood unites everyone. I was thinking about networks that could help this (and thinking around\u00a0digital networks - Airbnb / dating apps etc. and looked at\u00a0some mental health apps\u00a0)\u00a0I was mostly thinking about place and the fact that it\u00a0is true of all places that there would be really wretched experiences in need of processing and how this reality is something that\u00a0needed stepping up to. \u00a0I don't know of many\u00a0political\u00a0utopias that really take into account neurodiversity and conditions like\u00a0dementia.\nThis\u00a0perspective is drawn from my experience of talking to a multitude of strangers\u00a0these last few months and I realise there are many many issues when it comes to mental health. But I'll share my naive view as\u00a0I've been considering the role that I'd\u00a0taken\u00a0up in\u00a0wandering about listening\u00a0to whoever wanted or needed to talk and about the emotional healing of groups of people and how we so inadequately meet that in product driven cultures. The experience\u00a0left me thinking that peer support was exactly what was needed by a lot of people. Psychologists are too expensive for most and online tick boxes are not at all like being listened to or sharing experience.\u00a0There is something in spoken expression, being listened to and accepted that is\u00a0just vital for emotional processing. With a few technologists I\u00a0prototyped some systems that used voice recordings to play back these \"real\" expressions to others.\u00a0Again the emphasis was not on mental illness but on the similarities and the differences in the\u00a0longings of the inhabitants of particular locations - the project was inspired by thinking about\u00a0how it might be possible to\u00a0make networks in Nepal that in some way help\u00a0the expression and social processing of the shock around the earthquake.\u00a0However,\u00a0there had been a depth in\u00a0the experience of the interchanges that had happened\u00a0whilst\u00a0making the recordings that were\u00a0more interesting than the voice playback system. The interviews\u00a0always came out of a \"live\" sharing of experience (ie. the interviewee's expeirences and my own) and involved risk,\u00a0personal disclosure,\u00a0agency and shared discovery in a way that listening to a recording does not.\u00a0I am still wondering about\u00a0digital systems that allow\u00a0people to talk directly to each other in a structured way that could help them process their emotional situations. And I considered the various kinds of\u00a0conversations people might want - just to speak or perhaps a more formal recorded conversation that involved making a commitment.\u00a0Witnessed formal\u00a0statements - like rituals - can create marker points in people's lives.\u00a0Alchoholic's anonymous is probably a relevant example.\u00a0I wondered about the Samaritans model which sets up this sense that you can make a telephone\u00a0call if you are desperate and the \"Samaritan\" is steady,\u00a0sane and absolutely OK. I wonder about\u00a0a network\u00a0that simply says: whatever you are going through is part of the human experience ie. there is no\u00a0broken experience, but there certainly is incredibly challenging experience. \u00a0\nIt feels like a\u00a0given that two people who are\u00a0in grief may find solace in sharing their\u00a0real experience and connecting.\u00a0\u00a0And yet, to generalise,\u00a0Western communities often put empahsis on usefulness in society and direct\u00a0those\u00a0exhibiting signs of mental distress to simply \"be OK\"\u00a0/ go on medication / fix themeselves\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0I totally agree with the point you are bringing out that\u00a0\"the community\" is often woefully\u00a0dysfunctional at supporting or accepting unusual emotional situations. I wonder about a network that\u00a0links people as humans wanting to share something specific in a particular area of the world - so the region is the unifier, not the emotional suffering.\u00a0Perhaps I'm thinking of a more generalised target audience than you are considering but my sense is after walking Liverpool,\u00a0that everyone\u00a0who lives in a distributed\u00a0area\u00a0is in\u00a0someway involved in processing the emotions experienced in\u00a0that place. I'm aware this is a poetic notion but I think\u00a0various imaginative\u00a0re-framings\u00a0of the issue of mental health\u00a0is what's needed. Maybe this would only work as a\u00a0three way conversation with someone trained and with really\u00a0clear guidelines around use but my thinking here is that what's needed is not this expert / patient relationship but two humans sharing different experiences of living in a similar\u00a0place.\u00a0\nMy friend Denis Ngala at\u00a0TICAH, the Trust for Indigenous Culture and Health, an organisation in Kenya that works in linking\u00a0health and cultural knowledge was telling me about the work that was being done in Kenya\u00a0around victims of torture and reintegrating them back into society after they had given freedom again. The emphasis\u00a0he was communicating\u00a0was that recovery was not the problem of the victim\u00a0of torture\u00a0alone, but that it was the\u00a0community's task. They were working\u00a0to educate the community around how to support the individual live beyond\u00a0what they had lived through.\nReal-life conversations from real experience in which neither party is an expert\u00a0can be life changing.\u00a0I work a lot with VR and seeing through another's eyes is certainly helpful but what\u00a0really leads to\u00a0change is\u00a0honestly communicating difficult\u00a0experience and listening to others and accepting their experience. There's some sort of validation in the honesty of that\u00a0process that allows for shifts.\u00a0There are lots of CBT, brain training, \"look at things brighter\" apps around but perhaps\u00a0there's room for bold\u00a0digital networks - with some serious legal tick boxes in place\u00a0-\u00a0that\u00a0make possible structured honest relational\u00a0experiences between people in a particular place. It feels like using the digital to practice honestly speaking and\u00a0speaking in one's own name rather than anonymously would be helpful at this point. The histories of Snapchat et al. show the many superficial\u00a0ways that communication can go, but\u00a0there's a saviness emerging around\u00a0structuring and limiting online\u00a0encounter and creating a precise\u00a0invitation that makes me think it's possible. Online experiences\u00a0that move\u00a0into\u00a0relational and creative territory and away\u00a0from the sense that\u00a0mental difficulties have to be born alone like a scapegoat in the desert or solved once and for all\u00a0like winning in a\u00a0game - there's something about the unique experience of another person that is a random element that can startle out of insularity. An app for conversation for people in a particular country? A way of marking personal commitments to the self and receiving some real social validation for it? A whole raft of comedy solutions that normalise\u00a0being in dire straights and make\u00a0it feel like it's worth making the epic journey back to life?\u00a0Not sure, but you're right that there is a real need for help\u00a0with\u00a0processing emotions and it's something that a healthy culture should be able to give.", "created_at": "2016-12-27 19:43:13", "updated_at": "2016-12-27 19:43:13", "tag_id": 1140, "post_id": 16456, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 5625}, {"id": 13181, "text": "", "quote": "I really liked the concept of \u201cOpenVillage Houses\u201d as it will bring people together.

The absence of funds is making living in remote Greek islands extremely precarious if you happen to have an accident or life threatening illness. This process of conquest and colonisation by (relatively) faceless forces is no different than the earlier incarnations of colonialism whether we look at the spread of the East India Company or the colonisation of Egypt by the UK in the second half of the 19th century. The major difference today is the rather impressive propaganda whereby people are given the impression that \"there is no alternative\" (TINA). There always are alternatives at every stage in the unfolding of a war. The leader of Greece's SARIZA party, Tsipras, understands this when he says the conflict is between capital and people, and in the same breath states that it is not inevitable that Greece either imposes an austerity package or is kicked out of the Eurozone.

A cost-conscious,\u00a0community-based take on American healthcare may be able to teach the general population a thing or two about dealing with a broken healthcare system. Health care practices vary considerably across Amish communities and from family to family. Many Amish use modern medical services, but others turn to alternative forms of treatment within their community. \u00a0The Amish society accepts responsibility for their own actions and chooses not to depend on services offered by the state and Amish communities opt out of the government-funded insurance.

(For an account of how I came about this decision and my take on the crisis please follow this link here on Edgeryders) During my residence abroad I was working as a business consultant and marketer. After ten years, I decided to return to my Greece to contribute to the local community and help with the bringing about of change. I am currently (amongst others) working on a project called \u201cReal Food Utopia\u201d as a co-facilitator with a foreign research partner, dealing with the mapping of alternative food systems in the region of Thessaloniki. (For a full list of all the projects I'm working on currently and the great and exciting things we are creating in Greece and in EU and links to many of them please look here at another of my posts).\nThe workshops of the project are related to alternative economies, peri-urban gardening, refugees and food through a participatory procedure between people who belong to informal initiatives all around the city. This procedure also includes training in participatory video making and working on all its processes (ie. storyboards, editing) in order to create audiovisual material and share the technique with everyone who is interested in it.\nI am a member of the URGENCI International Network of Community Supported Agriculture, the European Research Group on CSA, and the European Movement for Food Sovereignty. I have been working as an activist on matters related to Food Sovereignty for 5 years and I am currently cooperating with a team of another three more advocates to create a legal entity to represent grassroots initiatives. In the near future, we would like to expand our network through an open call all over Greece and reclaim our existing collaborations and good synergies abroad.\nI am interested in self-sustainability and viable solutions with regards to how we live and thrive and hence I beleive that the future lies in the creation of new types of communities, ecovillages etc, and the promotion of practices like permaculture and the blue economy model of zero emissions that can create self-sufficient farmers and viable, circular economies that not only do not pollute, but actually create more resources instead of depleting them.\u00a0 I am trying to encourage Greek people to be more involved in Community-Supported Agriculture (CSA) schemes, to share risks with their farmers during the cultivating season and create a new concept of human relationship within the community they interact with. Additionally, the enhancement of CSA would support small-scale farmers who lack access to the local market and cannot (should not) get involved in complex food chains.\nWe would like to address the needs of small-scale farmers who wish to obtain access to European food markets at fair prices, but also consumers of all ages who become more conscious about food production and consumption. I would like to engage in interactive campaigns and seminars that target informal collectivities who are interested in food sovereignty, but lack financial resources and technical support. Our community project will form a new hub that will host them and their projects.\nWe are interested in creating a new agricultural production model in Greece, focusing on agroecology and self-sufficiency in the context of land and food management, considering limiting factors such as economic hardship. All in all, we pursue the transition to a new way of thinking and living through an \u201cumbrella\u201d project which consists of several innovative schemes.\nThe main scope of the project is to empower rural farmers and inspire rural lifestyle, by combining traditions and technology, based on the principles of permaculture. We wish to enhance small-scale agriculture, in order to revive Greece\u2019s rural areas and promote an economy that is based on social solidarity and alternative currencies.\nWhat we have in mind is summarized in the following fields of action:\n\n\nExporting network of agricultural products in Northern Europe (especially citrus, olive oil and \u201cugly\u201d fruits) that are produced by small-scale farmers to solidarity collectivities at fair prices.\n \n\nPromotion of food security and food sovereignty in Greece.\n \n\nRespond to the mainstream challenges by using our ingenuity and creativity for social \u2013nonpersonal- benefits.\n \n\nReduce food waste promoting \u201cugly\u201d fruits and vegetables focusing on good quality.\n \n\nBoost local economies and offer technical support to Community Supported Agriculture schemes.\n \n\nCreation of an official Greek hub for non formal groups working on food sovereignty that lack financial support.\n \n\nSaving of Greek agricultural land from the Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund and ensuring its utilization through concession or purchase by our group in the context of communal ownership.\n \nIncrease awareness and educate farmers and consumers in order to become more conscious through seminars, campaigns and training sessions about sustainable farming methods and consumption patterns.

We have people sharing their experiences making something for themselves or their loved ones (like Night Scout), but we also have people talking about their organizations and the people who are benefitting from them (like Orange House), which is still a step removed from, for example, getting stories from refugees themselves. Yet I wouldn't consider this any less of a personal experience. Similarly, students who have been given formal exercises to formulate their ideas, to me, are also valuable community members whose stories of creating technologies to deliver care are also important. From reading their posts, their contributions fit into the framework ---- presenting a problem, offering a solution. Then community members on Edgeryders interacting with them to ask for more information, make connections, etc. The important thing, from my perspective (and as @Alberto points out) is for them to stick around and respond to the comments. The value of sharing stories is to understand a) what kind of problems around care people are picking up on and addressing and b) how others react to their approach --- do they share similar problems, are they problematising the way that they are approaching it and offering other solutions, do they think the questions need to be reframed, etc. These reactions can take place on the platform (this is ideal) or in the actual world (still good, but we need a way of documenting this, as you point out @Moushira ).\nIt depends on what we are interested in. If we are trying, as @Alberto is, to map networks of people talking to one another, it is not entirely ideal to have someone reporting someone else's experience. If, though, we are going for a repository of knowledge and ideas, it doesn't matter so much.\nOnce we get to talking on a more macro level about the purpose each of the posts serve (much like we are doing now) we get into slightly different terrain. This is higher-level analytical work we are doing (for example, @Moushira , the content of your comment). I am trying to group these kinds of discussions under a \"methodology\" tag.\u00a0\nHere would be my ideal:\u00a0\n1) Tell stories in the first person as much as possible. To capture information, we need people writing on the platform itself rather than linking to information elsewhere. So, as the students are doing, writing about their projects.\n2) If someone has commented or interacted with you in the actual world, in my view it would be most helpful to record those in comments below the post. We are still thinking through how to do this, but creating dummy accounts would be a way of capturing interactions. Alternatively, if this is too difficult, it is okay to put it in the body of the post itself--- we will capture the content (knowledge, ideas, reactions) but we will lose the interactive node element.\u00a0\n3) non-stories are fine too --- analysis is really important, especially for writing reports, generating new and innovative methodologies, and making sense of data. We can gather these kinds of conversations and use them to make higher-level decisions about the project itself, what the data means, etc. I can still capture this information through codes and hierarchies.", "created_at": "2016-11-12 23:35:41", "updated_at": "2016-11-12 23:35:41", "tag_id": 1143, "post_id": 23595, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 5949}, {"id": 4818, "text": null, "quote": "@Noemi I mention @To-Steki in my story but it was before it's participation so I must correct the name and tag it.

I have been running my own Design business for the past 9 years ever since I have left the corporate hospitality world. I started with my company Design2Style in partnership with my Husband, designing residential & interiors and developing brand design for companies. Over time, my interest and knowledge of design thinking and strategy increased, gaining experience in projects and from attending various conferences on the subject, which resulted in moving forward, evolving personally and professionally. I launched Belgium Design Council, which applies design thinking on the project's infrastructural level. This allowed me to move from aesthetic design to applying design thinking processes in \u2018designing\u2019 communities.\nWe're working on several projects at the moment. I've got increasingly interested in Business Improvement District concept over the last couple of years, which existed since the 1960\u2019s/70\u2019s in the Northern America, and concentrated on socio-economical regeneration for business and communities as a whole. The combination of a geographical zone including businesses, community, people and the collaboration of those elements creating successful public, private and citizen partnerships, in order to enhance people's lives and environments. Creating sustainable socio/economic regeneration. BIDs and similar partnerships have been launched around the world - in Sweden, Scotland, Germany, England - and one of them is our non-profit organization of BIDs Belgium. We're also planning to launch BID EU in the near future, in order to create a platform for sharing best practices with each other and filter these down to ground level. I'm planning to concentrate on specific target groups - besides the regular social innovation aspect, there will also be the social inclusion of elderly, youth, special needs people and on ways in which we can involve them and make them feel more as a part of the community. There is a plan for the pilot version to be launched in September in my own community in Brussels, Koekelberg, in collaboration with the municipality. We will address the project to both 300 businesses of this district and 3 other neighboring districts.\nWe have also been developing and presenting the general information and interactive sessions for the BIDs in Brussels. We invited architects, developers, retailers, freelancers and members of the communities and explained the concept, but also ask them for feedback. There has\u00a0been positive feedback and some are really keen on implementing, but they need guidance - and we want to prepare and adapt the framework which has been shared by other BID countries, which would be useful and simplify the launching of BIDs across Belgium. The model works this way: by defining the geographical zone, having a collaborative approach to working together as a community, whilst addressing the issue that is of priority and defining the projects for that area. BIDs can be supported by a levy that business owners, citizens, and the municipality contributes to. Crowd-funding has also been used to support local projects. Some cities have it already in Belgium, albeit these are a slightly different models - Mechelen and Ghent for example. The BID is a non-profit organization, with a task force representation with an open source, collaborative and transparent approach and it needs to be inclusive of the Open Care element.\nI also have a personal project close to my heart - in which Belgium Design Council works on also. It's about special needs children. As there is a personal background to it - one of my sons is nearly 11 yrs old and\u00a0is autistic, with emotional and behavior regulation challenges. As we have been dealing with this since he was 2 yrs old, I have observed there is a big gap between what's available on the grassroots level for parents and at an institutional level. There is no support in the communities for parents with children with special needs for example. This personal project is about injecting more tools and awareness with creating more inclusive care in the communities themselves - also by using design thinking and visual tools, beyond pictograms available online. I have realized how much sensory input and additional energy my son needs and how much its presence could help him move around and understand things better - and visual designers and illustrators could greatly help such children. As Belgium Design Council we are planning now to fill this gap - one way is to work with the schools where children with special attend. \u00a0Our son will be changing to a further\u00a0specialised school closer to our\u00a0home now. I have spoken\u00a0with the principal\u00a0and he is very interested some of the creative\u00a0inclusive projects I have suggested,\u00a0but the school has\u00a0no time to initiate these - I have the experience and the knowledge and wish gather some support from other parents and see if we can move forward. Same for the people in the municipality, who are very much interested in this kind of work.\nMy Husband and I are also heavily involved in another nonprofit organization in Brussels and volunteer at a local football club, with over 300 youth from various backgrounds. We also have a goal of making this youth more inclusive and open - both for children with special needs, but also for refugees, who get refused from other football clubs around the city for example. We will introduce the first refugee children into the club for the coming season, which we are very proud of, as we see this as part of the wider community work we are involved in.\nIt seems to me that the initiatives, such as BIDs, should, in fact, be initiated by the city itself - and whenever I speak with the politicians, they understand it but resources and knowledge bases are at times limited. It can be challenging when systems and organizations need to change, understand and adopt design thinking themselves in order to be open for such initiatives and collaborations between private, public and citizens. The concept and ideas can appear too complicated, too political, too new and disruptive, yet many cities around the world are seeing the value this can bring.\nThis is why we decided to be active citizens, to get involved in various initiatives we are working on, pulling in our network and knowledge base - and turn things around by, inspiring, collaborating and sharing information, including enlisting more volunteers from the football club to the BIDs projects, showing that non-hierarchical organisations welcome everyone. It's important to talk, share, bring people together, because it's part of the process of change - and this is where OpenCare comes as a partner.\nDo you design better communities yourself? Do you have experience in different projects that solve problems of local groups by mobilizing them and the resources available at hand? Or maybe you know of an interesting project that feeds into this challenge?

In one project taking place at the lab, members are engineering yeast to express milk proteins from non-animal sources - next generation of vegan cheeses and milk. Others are busy developing an eco-friendly bacterial sunscreen.\nOpen Insulin is one of these projects, and its goal is to make it simpler and less expensive to make insulin, starting by investigating some novel ideas for making insulin in e. coli using fewer, easier steps than in common industrial protocols. If successful, the members hope it can be a step towards making generic production more economical, and might also enable more participation in research related to insulin, or production of the medicine at smaller scale, closer to the patients who need it, further reducing costs and giving access to more patients who lack it.\nCounter Culture Labs was founded by a group of hackers with diverse backgrounds and interests in the period from 2011 to 2012, with some members coming from Sudo Room, another hackerspace in Oakland that I participated in founding. Many were also involved in Occupy Oakland, and wanted to establish a more permanent organization with the same community spirit and values. Other members came from Biocurious, another biohacking space in Sunnyvale, in the southern end of the Bay Area. I became involved both because I shared the desire to build a community-focused institution, and because I have diabetes type 1 myself, which means I live with the frustration of costly and tedious treatment regimens day in and day out, and I know how much the standard of care for diabetes patients lags behind what recent research suggests might be possible. So, for my own sake, and for the sake of the others with the condition, I sought to take whatever steps I could to close the gap between the research and what is available to patients on the market right now.\nAbout a year ago, some long-standing discussions around making a bioreactor to produce insulin, which had inspired a few previous attempts, turned more concrete when Isaac Yonemoto, another independent researcher of medical treatments, made some suggestions to us about interesting possibilities for innovation and improvement in existing protocols. We started organising regular meetings, and out of those we then organized a successful crowdfunding campaign, which then opened up connections to professionals who work on various aspects of the problem, both the science and engineering around insulin, and the questions of access to medicine. Through this it came to our attention that access to insulin lags far behind the need even now, and even in the most developed countries - costs of insulin are prohibitive even to many people in the US - and all in all, roughly 50% of those in the world who require it have no access to insulin at all, according to the 100 Campaign, a group working on improving access to insulin around the world. There is almost no generic insulin on the American market at the moment - the first one appeared on the market about two weeks after we finished our crowdfunding campaign last year, but it is a long acting type, which is only part of the therapy required by people with diabetes type 1 (about 15-20% of diabetics in USA have type 1; the rest have type 2). And for those who use an insulin pump, short acting insulin is necessary.\nThe general problem in the first world is that the incentives and interests of producers and patient communities are not aligned.\nRight now we\u2019re focused on achieving the first scientific milestones, which is to produce proinsulin, the precursor of the active form of insulin, in e. coli, in our small-scale community lab. Our lab runs mostly on donated and salvaged equipment and reagents and might be comparable in its capabilities to a lab in a less-developed area of the world where there is the least access to insulin. If we succeed, it would show the possibility that small-scale producers in remote areas might be able to make insulin to satisfy local demand, in places where centrally-manufactured supplies can\u2019t reach due to lack of infrastructure - where what roads there are, if any, do not let refrigerated trucks pass to ship needed pharmaceuticals in. Once we have a protocol that embraces everything from production to purification to near the level of purity of pharmaceutical grade insulin, we plan to approach established generics manufacturers with a case for the economic feasibility of serving the unserved market for insulin, and to partner with them to do the rest of the work of achieving sufficient purity of the product and scaling the methods to production. As we proceed with our work, the main batch of patents around the various forms of insulin are expiring, which will further help us make the case for a comprehensive portfolio of treatments to potential generics manufacturers.\nProvided all this goes well, we might then pursue another idea, closer to our original hope of a bioreactor that produces insulin, and a kind of \u2018holy grail\u2019 goal in the DIY bio world, which is a desktop biofactory, an analog of desktop 3D printers, but for proteins and biologics, which we might develop to first execute one of our protocols to produce insulin, but which we might also design with more flexibility in mind. This would consist of a bioreactor portion that could grow a culture of e. coli or yeast, and then extract and purify a product from it - very roughly speaking, the union of a fermenter with an FPLC, a piece of equipment that purifies proteins. If that is possible, supply of insulin could be placed very close to the demand of the diabetics around the world in a simple, economical package, and reliance on distribution infrastructure would be minimized. It would also reduce the need to have skilled technicians with years of lab experience to execute these protocols by hand.\nUltimately, I hope that opening up the tools for research to more people can help to bring research on cures to patients, and not just treatments. Let me mention a few of the more promising ideas that have had some success in research settings. One approach is to implant functioning pancreatic cells from a donor and protect them from immune attack by various means - hard to scale if you need a constant supply of donors,but it might be possible to grow cultures of the cells in vitro to address this. Another approach is to get the immune system to cease its attack on pancreatic cells, and promote the regrowth of the body\u2019s own insulin-producing cells, either in the pancreas, or in another tissue via gene therapy - a simpler approach to apply once it is developed. Some of the ideas use very inexpensive supplies such as adjuvants, the materials in vaccines that provoke an immune response - and there has been some success using adjuvants alone, or with carefully chosen additions, to get the bodies of diabetic patients to reduce or cease their autoimmune attacks. Other concepts address the metabolic changes behind type 2 diabetes. Several drugs between the research and commercial worlds of medicine can act directly on the metabolic control mechanisms of the body, changing its pattern of energy use and other aspects of metabolism back from the pathological state of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes to the normal, healthy base state. Some of them are small organic molecules, easier to make than proteins such as insulin, but due in part to reasons of cost and incumbency, are not mainstream treatments yet.\nAt the most general level, what we seek to prove is that if an order of magnitude more people get involved in research and development of science and technology, medicine can progress much faster, and might no longer be held back by institutional constraints and perverse incentives in the economics of the institutions. Right now, we\u2019re a group about half a dozen people working regularly on the project, with a few dozen more people in touch every now and then to help out, and a hundred or two in the extended community, ready to answer a question or call for help. Every week or two, someone new comes to the group, who just learned about the project via the media or our regular meetups, and wants to help. Some are complete beginners and end up taking our introductory classes to biohacking, some already have experience but got tired of the limits of the institutions where they worked, or have relatives with diabetes and want to contribute to progress. Though we\u2019re building up a broader community of participation in research slowly, we hope our efforts can plant many seeds out of which future innovations will grow.\nMeanwhile, we are looking to broaden a circle of people who can advise us, experienced scientists and engineers who can help us troubleshoot issues that inevitably come up when investigating the unknown, but we also hope to inspire other groups to work independently in a broader community of innovation. We would like to set up a network of both institutional and DIY researchers living all around the world who have different approaches and ways of making insulin as well as tackling other diabetes and health related issues. Beyond producing drugs, participants might research questions of access to medicine, investigate what patient communities need the most, look at academic publications to identify the most promising research that is not making it out to serve patients, or help establish the effort to build the desktop biofactory. Part of our goal is to prove it\u2019s possible and worthwhile for people outside institutions to take the initiative on these questions, and inspire others to take the lead in their own efforts and bring about the broader changes we seek.\nDo you have any projects in health, medicine, or biohacking that you\u2019d like to work on, but lack people, knowledge, or resources to make it happen? Are you working on a diabetes-related solution? Or do you feel like a network of care biohackers is something you\u2019d like to get involved with?

Operating as a nonprofit technology company, we develop free and open-source tools that can be adapted for specific uses, backed by evidence. Health workers currently use Medic Mobile to register every pregnancy, immunize infants against illnesses, track disease outbreaks faster, keep stock of essential medicines, and communicate about emergencies. Our platform is built for the last mile of healthcare, supporting over 12,000 community health workers in 23 countries.\nWe currently have 52 staff and three hubs: San Francisco, USA; Kathmandu, Nepal; Nairobi, Kenya. Not all of our staff works out of these hubs - about \u2153 of the team is remote. We spend a lot of time on Slack!\nOur approach has its roots in service and human-centered design. A lot of people are using these ideas now. Seven years ago, when we started, they were not so well known. We have a whole team of designers, including regional designers who use a participatory, ethnographic, HCD approach. They do in-depth site visits and investigate the context in which the apps will be used, and use a variety of techniques to do so: system mapping, role playing, in-depth interviewing. Some questions they might ask: \u201cWhat is the current workflow? Ideal workflow?\u201d, \u201cWhat is the day-to-day like for end users?\u201d It\u2019s an intensive and essential process.\nWe\u2019re inspired by a whole host of organizations in this space, including IDEO, Acumen, etc. 100% of our staff do a HCD crash course. Specifically for our designers, we have our own design curriculum, and many of them come from an HCD or anthropology background.\nWhat are the services that Medic Mobile provides?\nMedic believes that health is a human right. We know that global health disparities around the world are vast, and it\u2019s estimated that one billion people will never see a doctor in their lifetime. In many places around the world - especially low and middle income countries - community health workers (CHWs) are closing that gap. CHWs are community members - sometimes volunteers, but ideally paid - who provide basic AND complex health care for their neighbors. Our vision is to equip these CHWs with mobile technology and the right tools to increase their impact.\nFor example, a community health worker can support in the following ways:\n\n\nIdentifying and supporting pregnant women;\n \n\nHelping ensure the pregnant woman gets four antenatal care checkups, and identify any danger signs. (Having frequent checkups increases the chance the mother will give birth in a facility and survive child birth.)\n \n\nEnsure that children are vaccinated fully;\n \n\nScreen children and adults for common diseases (diarrhea, malaria), malnutrition, mental health, etc.\n \n\nIn many of these scenarios, community health workers serve as first responders, so that patients can start getting treatment quickly.\nMedic Mobile\u2019s tools are oriented around specific evidence-based use cases that have a clear impact logic. For example, we know that if we support a pregnant woman receiving a full course of antenatal care, she is more likely to deliver in a facility and survive child birth. Our use cases currently are:\n\n\nAntenatal care\n \n\nChildhood immunizations\n \n\nUnder 5 child health\n \n\nStock monitoring\n \n\nDisease surveillance\n \n\nWhat the means is that in above areas, we have a ton of evidence and experience that our tools work. For a new use case - say, an area of health services or protocol that we\u2019re not as familiar with - we have to do a lot of design. The design and product development teams are very tightly integrated.\nAs far as tools, we have tools for basic phones and smartphones (Android exclusively). We work with implementing partners and/or governments to equip health workers with these tools.\nI was interested that you mentioned delivering advanced/complex care this way?\nBroadly, when you\u2019re dealing with delivering care for complex health conditions in resource-poor settings, there\u2019s two issues:\n1) Practically, you need what Paul Farmer calls \u201cstaff, stuff, space, systems.\u201d You need expert knowledge. For example, to treat cancer, you need a professionalized cadre, you need certain goods like chemotherapy drugs, etc. All of that won\u2019t be delivered solely through community health workers.\n2) Where community health workers can come in for complex health conditions is in coordinating access, screening, and adherence to treatment. For example, with HIV. Thirty years ago, the World Health Organization suggested that delivering HIV care to the ultra poor was \u201ctoo difficult, that there wasn\u2019t enough money, it was too difficult to get people to adhere to medications out in the community.\u201d Partners In Health (whose work is very influential for us) showed that community health workers can support people in adhering to HIV medication.\nSame for TB. They proved that if you make the drugs available, you can even support the treatment of Multi-Drug Resistant TB through CHWs\u2013 where you have to take drugs daily for almost two years (and they have terrible side effects). Again, this is through trained community health workers in a process they call \u201caccompaniment,\u201d where CHWs are following up every day, providing support and guidance and ensuring that people are taking meds. In India, there\u2019s been a lot of success with the Home Based Newborn Care protocol which provides guidance to community health workers around the first 45 days of life and navigating the major risks to a child\u2019s life during that period.\nCommunity health workers are starting to be used in the US, too \u2013 in Harlem, First Nation communities, and the rural South. So CHWs can definitely support health issues that are complex and difficult, and in fact, can probably do so more effectively and with more touch points than a physician could.\nDo health workers have to be literate to use Medic tools?\nIdeally, yes, but we\u2019ve worked with many CHWs\u00a0that have mixed or low literacy. For example, the Female Community Health Volunteer (FCHV) network in Nepal has mixed literacy. We\u2019ve equipped them with basic phones where the FCHV can text something very basic like \u201cP 12 Jill\u201d to mean \u201cJill is pregnant, her last menstrual period (LMP) was 12 weeks ago.\u201d Then, Medic Mobile will send the health worker SMS messages, reminding her to remind Jill about her antenatal care checkups. Someone with a low level of literacy can still use these messages, and we provide booklets/guides to make sure they can remember how. We also have a thorough training process, where we start with teaching these health workers (if needed) how to turn on their phones, how to enter characters, everything from soup to nuts. In Nepal specifically, many FCHVs have reported feeling more empowered and motivated after being trained to use these mobile tools for their work.\nHow are your tools evolving?\nThat\u2019s a very timely question. We are combining what we\u2019ve learned over the last 6-7 years and developing apps that support key shifts that we\u2019re seeing in global health care delivery.\nWe are moving beyond data collection to decision support. Previously, our tool was often a substitute for form filling (ie. registering a pregnancy), but more and more, we are helping community health workers make decisions \u2013 around complex protocols for under 5 child health, for example. We\u2019re moving towards supporting integrated performance management of CHWs, managing CHW targets and providing support for supervisory meetings between community health workers and their managers. Also, integrated health systems require integrated technology tools that will support families over time and across a variety of health issues. If we simply organize health information by specific conditions or by form, we could miss opportunities to provide longitudinal support, leave out important social and historical context, and create unintuitive workflows.\nIn general, we know that reactive systems that rely on sick patients showing up at facilities don't achieve equitable health outcomes. Health systems should be proactive and timely by design: mobile tools have an important role to play in bringing health workers to families' doorsteps often and early.\nHow do you coordinate with local government and politicians?\nWe are usually working with long term community-based partners. Ideally, organizations who already work\u00a0with the local government. At some point, we want the local government to take over our mobile tools; the goal is always for the ministry to take over. We also sit on advisory committees and advise national eHealth and mHealth strategy in many of the countries where we work. We are committed to sustainable use of our tools. For that, we have to work hand in hand with local and national governments.\nIs it open source? Can I deploy my own?\nAll our software is open source. You can certainly deploy our tools yourself, especially our DIY toolkit. All of our code is available online at Github.", "created_at": "2017-02-11 19:53:12", "updated_at": "2017-02-11 19:53:12", "tag_id": 1144, "post_id": 564, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 531}, {"id": 4850, "text": null, "quote": "Open Insulin is one of many projects at Counter Culture Labs, a biohacker space in Oakland, CA.

Open source methods of production are relevant not just to aligning incentives and improving the economics of software development, but also to scientific reproducibility and transparency, and in both software and science, open source can enable more participation and progress than trying to hold secrets close.
