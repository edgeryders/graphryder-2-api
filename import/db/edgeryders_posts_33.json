If you have specific comments on the wiki itself, feel free to comment on that thread instead. \n\nAn update from me: right now I am done with my coding sprint and am finishing up my coding categories -- this should make it much easier to navigate my codes and apply them to your datasets. I'm in the process of using these to refine and merge my own codes before doing a final code review on each of your codes. Looking forward to seeing all of yours as well! \n\nAs a reminder, we are going to finish this coding sprint by **July 1st.** Please finish coding by this date (including creating your categories) and take til *Friday this week* to comment on others' codebooks and especially look out for overlapping codes, so we can merge codes and have clean codebooks before I initiate the SSNA visualisation. If you need more time, please say so ASAP. \n\nWe'll then schedule a call for late next week to discuss the visualisation and plan the writing of the update. \n\nThanks and happy coding!", "created_at": "2020-06-29 09:51:17.582214", "updated_at": "2020-10-17 12:03:23.476019", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 243, "wiki": false, "reads": 25, "score": 50.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4794, 6484], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31389, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 3943, "post_number": 23, "raw": "<b>Good news!</b>\n\nThanks for taking a look, Dan. For potentially later doing live-syncing to CATMA, we would also needd if code hierarchies can be managed independently of the codings themselves. Finding it out can wait until if and when we get to the live syncing part. From the data structures (just looking at the <a href=\"https://github.com/mpetris/catma/tree/master/testdocs\">CATMA example files</a> that you found), it seems possible. Code hierarchy and codings are in the same <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">document_user.xml</code> file (so we'd need to figure out partial imports), but at least it's possible to refer to existing tags by ID, so no need to re-import them every time which would replace a hierarchy built inside CATMA.\n\nAll fine on this front, so far.

So I decided to do it the way I know best. So I just started trying things out hoping to bump into something cool. \n\nI was fascinated by a mycelium and kombucha basics workshop I followed. So the first thing I did after the workshop was trying to grow some kombucha myself. I  was really hyped to try some things out on my homegrown  material. But then the waiting period started. The first days checked on it daily. I after a week or so my interest was fading away. I started to get rather frustrated with the slow growing pace.  \n\nAfter a day or 12 I decided to harvest my kombucha \u2018sheet\u2019. It wasn\u2019t that thick yet but I was tired of waiting and wanted to start experimenting.

Do you think a private company with such huge impact should not be held accountable for their actions? Also, why do you think a company more powerful than most countries does not affect policy making for its own purpose?\n\nWhat news outlets? Do you see the difference between news outlets today and 50 years ago? What makes you think news outlets are independent entities actually publishing real information? That used to be their purpose...today they are the most powerful weapons used as such. What am i talking about, it started long time ago. They were used to create paranoia and were an essential weapon for extermination of Native Americans. They were used also to sway public opinion when England went to war versus the Zulus. Again, used to spread the damn racist theories about all native peoples in order to further justify appropriating their lands and making slaves out of them. They are weaponised and they need to be treated as such. News outlets...please, let's be real. They do more damage today than any weapon we used in warfare over the last 60 years...\n\nThey manufacture consent in supposed democracies with false information or filtered information to create certain world view. That makes any democracy obsolete. I am okay with that actually, let's just call spade a spade. Just declare martial law, officialise fascism and declare freedom of speech is an illusion. In short, I have no problem with any of the actions they do. I just wish we called things their right names. See how much public support they get then. I also wish there were consequences for their actions, and judging by your answer...no wonder there are none. Who will hold them accountable.\nI wonder would you say \"well they report what they report\" if they all dehumanised your people spreading lies, with goal of convincing the rest of the world it is okay to wage war against you.

Citizen education and open source projects seem to be collective-but-not-institutional solutions, rather than individual ones.\n[/quote]\n\nGood point, important distinction to be made here. \n\nThere's a theme of `individualising responsibility` -- that responses to problems that are created by and large by institutions are being proposed on the individual level (e.g. improving your own privacy settings, making decisions about what you're willing to trade off, becoming more educated about the promises and perils of online behaviour). \n\nThis is not altogether surprising, since it's something academics point out quite a lot (especially re:climate change, that the onus being put on individuals to do green things like recycle does not match up solution-wise in changing the big picture culprits of climate change, corporations). \n\nThe difference or question here may be: what about the collective responses that aren't institutional, like those you suggest (open source projects and citizen education). Are these the areas we might be able to effect change in --- bigger than the individual, but not as daunting as trying to change the behaviour of big corporations head-on? \n\nThis is a question I definitely want to pursue further, as it might get us out of some of the typical conversational/argumentative binds we find ourselves in. \n\nFollow-ups emerge from this, in part inspired by talks yesterday: how accessible are these collective responses (e.g. are open source movements accessible to more than just a small amount of homogenous people in terms of socioeconomic demographics?

Unfortunately I have seen in practice that the bigger players are immune to it, and they are the ones getting so much money indeed. Why? Well locally they simply have too much influence.\n\nOver regulation is very counter productive.

The computerization/mechanisation of the public sector has largely been driven by the hope that logical government (deterministic decisions, given certain input deterministic output) will make society more \"just\" and \"equal\" (i.e. a computer does not have the social sensitivity to discriminate, for instance, and even when it does - for instance through statistical short-comings - we can normally measure and assess the discrimination that occurs). But we are now half a century in to computerization - has it worked?\n\nI think \"lasagna-style\" technologies, which are vertically separated as a matter of technology, are more likely to lead to an outcome of increased \"justice\". Because I think of justice as something which guarantees to individuals freedom to act - commercially and socially - and this freedom can only be obtained if market entry barriers are low, or if technologies lend themselves to a multitude of entities cooperating on different levels. I'd prefer, for this reason, WiMAX and Wi-Fi over LTE systems and cellular networks, and I am for this reason cautious about 5G.\n\nWith my rudimentary understanding of Italian, the 15 proposals for justice would impact technology development - would they be advanced by technology development?

New configurations of offline-online work and leisure time, like [work-life balance vs work-life integration ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/remote-work-for-everyone-what-we-stand-to-gain/14192/35), have been topics of discussion. Part of the impact of covid-19 has been a shift to online  and a corresponding sense of loss: of  public space, of  social engagement, with mental health impacts. One way of addressing this has been to seek a  sense of community by reworking offline spaces to increase  social interaction even as work and education increasingly shifts online. These are connected to larger questions about imagining the future and building alternatives: the Next Generation Internet is about more than just online social dynamics, and what we bring to bear on it is this question of what it does to communities, how we make them, and how we imagine other worlds together, through our everyday engagements with internet technology and its impacts.\n\n![Screenshot 2020-10-05 at 11.00.11|690x558](upload://v6iYh3D5yl8mPXDEOkPflWfydqK.png) \n\n Work-life balance is diversifying, so workspaces won\u2019t all look the same, and because of the capacities of online communication, we can potentially begin to radically rethink what a workspace is, to make it more conducive for the well-being of more people (especially if we can resist exploitative surveillance tech). We\u2019re also learning about the limits of online communication \u2013 fatigue and capacity. Digital policy is still about holistic human experience, so the internet's effect on public space and its uses are still huge factors in crafting it.\n\n**Negotiating Privacy/Personal Data Trade-offs** \n\nThe crucial subcategory here is the relationship between corporate interest (particularly of \"big tech\" companies) and public good (part of the profit/power nexus discussed in the report). Key topics here include user agency and control and the trade-off that sets up with user experience: how much effort community members without a high level of technological expertise can or want to to put in to controlling their personal data and deciding what trade-offs are worth it. \n\nThere\u2019s an emergent theme of  individualising responsibility: that responses to problems that are created by and large by institutions are being proposed on the individual level (e.g. improving your own privacy settings, making decisions about what you\u2019re willing to trade off, becoming more educated about the promises and perils of online behaviour). Removing this onus from the individual is important, but individuals also feel overwhelmed at the power yielded by large corporations and unable to see where they can meaningfully intervene when they want to. But what about the collective responses that aren\u2019t as institutional, like open source projects and citizen education? Are these the areas we might be able to see people effecting change in \u2014 bigger than the individual, but not as daunting as trying to change the behaviour of big corporations head-on?\n\nWho owns data is also a key theme here, relating to the issue of data governance and control over personal data. \"Defining terminology\" is a code often tied to some of the models themselves, which indicates that more clarity is needed when entering buzzword territory around data governance models.  \n\n**The promises and possible shortcomings of Open Source technology.** \nOpen Source is a hot topic on the platform, discussed by a wide range of community members (from grassroots activists to academics, technologists and beyond). Questions emerge around whether open source solutions can lead to greater empowerment, human-centred design, and imagining other alternatives to the status quo (of \"big tech\" control). \n\n![Screenshot 2020-10-05 at 10.49.23|690x505](upload://xbiKTiFLfdXNRrN8rf39ARDl5zD.png) \n\nFollow-ups emerge from this: how accessible are these collective responses (e.g. are open source movements accessible to more than just a small amount of homogenous people in terms of socioeconomic demographics? Do these citizen education projects still serve to shift focus and blame away from big tech/corporations, or do they offer another way forward in terms of collective action?)\n\n**Algorithms, AI and Regulation** \n\nContent moderation, misinformation, safety, inequality, transparency, and oversight all come up in relationship to artificial intelligence and algorithms. Understanding how community members discern the truth (related to issues of information quality and access) has been a key theme on the platform, and one only growing with both the US election results and increasing regulations around covid-19 and contact tracing. These concepts are also related to smart cities and human rights, as sensing and tracking technologies in smart cities are tied to a question of whether to trust data-gathering government tech or resist these sensing technologies and automated decision-making systems -- and if the latter, how to do so. \n\n![image|505x515](upload://oV5qfJaw7McKsGCl6SfgVJV9oCm.png) \n\n**Runner up: environmentalism and internet technology** \n\nWe could possibly still focus on this, since Green New Deal topics are rapidly expanding on platform. The physical waste produced by digital technologies as well as the possibility of online shifts having a positive effect on climate change (lowering emissions and reducing carbon footprints) are topics of discussion. \n![image|601x247](upload://tt6qFpMC7YA6pIpwaLQUXHkCiHv.png)", "created_at": "2020-11-10 11:55:02.822764", "updated_at": "2020-11-10 12:02:24.004134", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 920, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 12.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [86473], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 40222, "user_id": 4040, "topic_id": 7772, "post_number": 30, "raw": "Bonjour,  d'accord je vais d\u00e9velopper avec @Sohayeb un workshop sur la cr\u00e9ation de l'identit\u00e9 visuelle et les diff\u00e9rents supports graphiques :slight_smile:", "created_at": "2017-12-11 12:08:28.301017", "updated_at": "2017-12-11 12:08:28.301017", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 23, "wiki": false, "reads": 20, "score": 144.0, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [40199], "is_liked_by": [3703, 3947, 3, 4094, 3904], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18290, "user_id": 31, "topic_id": 1680, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Grow Options In Many Small Boxes</b>\n\nAlberto MZ,\n\nThinking outside the box is almost a job, if we want to.\n\nFor years I've looked into specific lateral thinking tools (basically, look at how our ideas flow inside our minds, and then challenge every assumption so that flow will go to other places). The point I want to make is that, even though the specifics of each tool change, the biggest emphasis is in <u>focus</u>.\n\nThe broad focus is we want to help\u00a0society help the change-maker. How can we slice and dice the work so that we will find new ideas for each smaller focus point?\n\nFirst, slice and dice ... I think \"society\" is too vague a word, and can be <u>mapped</u> as \"all the concentric circles around the change-maker\". Or maybe as \"a set of networks of which he or she are a node\". Or even \"the networks of which the individual is _not_ a node\". Or maybe there are other ways to model reality?\n\nIn any case, the outcome of this first step is that the specific foci would be \"we want to help X help the change-maker\", where X = self, family, friends, neighbours, other change-makers, regional businesses, regional institutions, regional governments, country and international entities, etc ... leaving room for the yet-to-be-invented, and for cooperation among levels.\n\nI'll be off-line for a week or so, but maybe we can be systematic about this? <u>For each X</u>, look at what works (you have experience, I don't), what the blocks are (same), what the ways forward could be (I can help with that, maybe). Looks almost like a spreadsheet to me, and some rows (each X is a row) are possibly not even touched yet, or touched in an effective way!\n\nAfter that, cross-pollinate between rows, select a number of ideas, process them further to select one or two first-steps for each, and end up (actually the process never ends, so release-early-release-often) with a two-pronged fork: a number of ideas to be suggested as policy _and_ also to be left in the open so individuals and networks may act on them.\n\nIdeas don't grow or move themselves. But we can kick the can just one more step forward, openly, keep the questions open (thank you!), and invite each other to keep at it doing what we like. (Cooperative thinking is work, but may feel like play.)\n\nMaybe?\n\n", "created_at": "2011-12-30 13:39:02", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:42.162064", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 444, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 1.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 57733, "user_id": 4793, "topic_id": 10409, "post_number": 18, "raw": "@noemi @alberto @natalia_skoczylas Yes, I will!

Example: you said that the code `regulating 5G` should be split into `regulation` co-occuring with `5G`, because other parts of the conversation might evoke regulating something else, for example `recommendation algorithms`. If this is indeed the case, you are able to see the discussion on regulation on a broader level, as `regulation` will then link to both `5G` and with `recommendation algorithms` in the semantic network. At a high level of interpretation, this ends up allowing the space for regulation, as the community sees it, to emerge. \n1. The Codebook is now on a GDoc. By doing this shoot-from-the-hip prototyping you are zeroing in on functionalities that future iterations of Open Ethnographer needs. The fact that you use them is a strong indication that you need them, as in really need them.\n\nAnd speaking of this: @matthias, it seems the ethno team uses comments a lot. They took the trouble of rebuilding the whole codebook on GDocs, and it looks like this:\n\n![Codebook%20as%20wiki|690x366](upload://nEdg60laJ642OckUaUNR6oeKIiV.jpeg) \n\nI think, however, that the codebook should be automatically generated by OE. The codebook proper is a list of codes (that are all in the database) followed by their respective descriptions (also in the database). Can we make them commentable? Or maybe just generate codebooks that can be exported?\n\n@amelia @Leonie @CCS", "created_at": "2019-08-22 11:13:16.277487", "updated_at": "2019-10-14 09:23:59.973410", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 340, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 108.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3323, 2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14909, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 1235, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Do you personally compromise for Kyopol? </b>\n\nDear Pedro,\n\nCommitting to making such a change in the way govts and citizens communicate must take some time.\u00a0I see you have been interested in civic engagement for some time now.

It has worked for medicine for thousands of years, why cannot it work for technology now? \n\nThe original Hippocratic oath is, of course, a pre-capitalist institution: a fossile, if you will. The creators of the Tech Pledge are clearly aware of it, because the pledge says, among other things:\n\n> I commit [...]\n>* to always put humans before business, and to stand up against pressure to do otherwise, even at my own risk.\n>\n> * to never tolerate design for addiction, deception or control.\n\nI am not enough of a technologist to take the pledge myself (or am I?) but I wonder if @matthias and @hugi would be up for taking it for the Edgeryders team. \n\nI also wonder: how powerful is moral suasion in preventing creepy (but lucrative) stuff to happen?

This article examines different future imaginaries present in Future Internet Architecture (FIA) projects funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) from 2006 to 2016, whose goal was to incorporate social values while building new protocols to replace Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol to transfer and route information across the ever-expanding Internet. I examine the findings from two of the NSF\u2019s FIA projects\u2014Mobility First (MF) and eXpressive Internet Architecture\u2014to understand the projects\u2019 trajectories and values directives through their funding cycle and their projections into the future. I discuss how project documentation and participant articulations fall into the following three distinct themes about past experience and speculation: understanding the public, negotiating resources, and carrying project values into the future. I conclude that if the future Internet is to promote positive sociotechnical relationships, its architects must recognize that complex social and political decisions pervade each step of technical work and do more to honor this fact.\"\n\nKeywords\nfuture imaginaries, Future Internet Architectures, Values in Design, networking protocols, critical informatics", "created_at": "2020-12-05 13:24:58.915535", "updated_at": "2020-12-05 13:25:36.672013", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 261, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 67.2, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2915, 3310, 3323, 4934], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26261, "user_id": 30, "topic_id": 1670, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>Fabulous work, guys</b>\n\nVery, very good work, guys.

It is already happening as this how Cairo functions, and as explained above by @hegazy it is a special\u00a0 kind of informality, but we need also to be aware of the the informality failures and to to romanticize the informality as a general case.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-12-20 12:00:29", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:16.738188", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 349, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2566, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32620, "user_id": 2636, "topic_id": 4517, "post_number": 36, "raw": "<b>I'm in as well!

You can't build that with an IoT device.\n\nIn the UK, part of the problem is that the approach of using \"Free Market\" solutions for this cannot provide an equitable system for everybody. Because companies are legally required to make a profit for their share-holders, they are forced cherry-pick their market segments accordingly.\n\nThis is not a problem when you're making and selling mobile phones or laptops. Market segmentation is an entirely appropriate strategy to maximising profit, as your customers aren't forced to use your products.\n\nIt's a problem when you're fulfilling service sector contracts. Because the tendering process has been set up, so that there are different geographical regions covered by tenders. The for-profit companies are legally required to cherry-pick the best contracts, and turn down the most expensive.

All of the people in the workshop were people I know, except for one, and I can say that this was the most honest discussion they have ever made while talking to someone in a workshop, maybe because of the methodology followed by @Nadia maybe, it engaged people from the start.\u000bWhat was common for all the people in the room, is that WE ARE HERE, we want to change the situation in Medenine, because it is not fair for us to not be given opportunities that you easily find in other regions of the country.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b91d668376dbac8dd932e89ab871a89a2ec6bf62.jpg\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\">\n\nMost of the people talked about the communication, they mentioned the non ability for the youth in here to communicate correctly, because we don't communicate often, and that is what they loved about the workshop, they were TALKING to each other and saying everything they think about, and COMMUNICATING in a very passionate way.\u000bMost of them complained about the severe lack of activities that we can do in here, it is as I said in my story, people has nothing in between job and school to do, the life in here is passive and full of deadly routine, there is no space for innovation and mental productivity. What I loved the most and captured me the most is that people were talking with passion about what we can do in Medenine, it wasn't like individual perspectives and projects like the case in Monastir and Tunis! But it was more about what we can do to HELP Medenine. I was always told by @Nadia and @Zmorda that I am so in love with Medenine, but then after this workshop I think it is obvious that most of the people in here are so in love with it.\n\n\n## 2: Social Innovation Camp\n\nA similar thing I noticed in both the workshop and the training is how emotional the participants get when talking about Medenine. A lot of the participants tackled the social problems that they feel related to, but did they start working on it? No. You\u2019d find most of the participants in both the training and the workshop blaming the mindset for what is happening, but now I see that the problem is deeper than that, in terms of the perspectives, so maybe the mindset that everyone was complaining about is in them, maybe they are blocking themselves?\n\nMy point is that people complain, people feel that something is wrong, their brain tells them something is wrong! But what is next? Does it get any deeper than sensing the existence of a problem? You\u2019d find people in here so passionate about Medenine? But why things are not changing? Some of them started to work on these problems, but is it working? If yes, why? If no, why?\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/4/4eff79c160c641ab04be276cf90f51f2423cc2a7.JPG\" width=\"690\" height=\"517\">\n\n\n## 3: OurGhema in all of the above\n\nAll of that was mentioned  will lead to a different orientation for OurGhema, that will focus on CRITICAL THINKING, because now I think that the youth of the region should learn how to analyze the problems, what solutions can be applied? Medenine is full of problems, that means it is full of opportunities, how to work on these opportunities.\n\nI find that this place is full of potential, opportunities and I don\u2019t appreciate if someone from Medenine acts as if it is some place full of ignorants that is waiting for help, and in the different experiences of collaboration with international organization / embassies, I met some of those people that I personally think are affecting Medenine, so I think OurGhema should focus on the appraisement of Medenine, and abolishing the underestimation of it, and works on a valorization of the existing resources.\n\nI can say that this experience enriched me, in terms of skills development. I took part of different international experiences, with different institutions (Institut Fran\u00e7ais, American Embassy, European Cultural Foundation, Minbar, CFI \u2026) but the Edgeryders experience was different because somehow it feels warmer, and you would literally that there is a whole community that is supporting you!\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f7faa3134e4d3ddd1a746ea83f0eac28bd70638d.jpg\" width=\"257\" height=\"172\">\n\nWhen I started working on the physical location of the project and preparing the space I was surprised by the amount of support I got from the youth of the region, that I have had people spending the nights with me and helping me \u2026 that was so emotional for me and gave me more reasons to keep on working on the space.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/c/ce62e5cd6247898cc2148064739e663aab7adb3a.jpg\" width=\"195\" height=\"260\">\n\nOurGhema is launched: On the 6th of May, 2018 I finally made it! And it was in the local news, people were happy about it and I am only receiving positive feedback about my baby OurGhema; I started working on the critical thinking part (which I highly say that it was something that I knew I should focus on the most through my experience with the Edgeryders) through a different series of events.\n\n\n## 4: What is next?\n\nI am quoting from @Dorsaf: \u201cIt is funny how I found a life changing opportunity to develop my work on what I love in Medenine, in a local place, and not in Tunis the capital where I spent 5 years studying there!\"\n\nHearing that made me realise that I am actually helping change the reality in here! I always say that OurGhema is an opportunity hub, and here it is providing them for the youth of the region \u2026\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/75328509bea5d76c2e0502148f81af06890b3ea8.jpg\" width=\"400\">\n\nI love what I did with Edgeryders, the innovation camp, the workshops\u2026and until this moment I still have different people coming to me and asking me what is next? Are we going to have something else? And my answer is: you never know! I think a lot of work maybe done in the future, now that I have OurGhema working, and it had a very good first month, with an average of 40 people coming per day, I strongly believe that we can have a lot more to do!\n\n* The incubation program is something we certainly can work on, in fact two days ago, about forty young men from Medenine died in the sea while they were trying to illegally go to Europe, Medenine now is mourning its youth, a woman lost her four babies in this accident and this give me one more reason to keep on working on the incubation program! \n\n    Think of it this way: OurGhema provided a job for two young men right from its start! If we incubate different people and help them start their projects they will be creating job opportunities for others! For those who are so desperate that they will risk their lives to get a new life in Europe.. Investing in people is the key. \n\n* Digital Medenine is also a project that I am sure will have a very good positive impact in Medenine, putting a light on the good sides of Medenine, attracting people to it leading to creating jobs for the youth! A lot of places used to be touristic in Medenine and included a lot of jobs but for some reason the government have cut the touristic cycle in it, leading to more problems. ping @matthias\n\n**Edgeryders is all the community, is all about finding new ways, and it is something that I am strongly working on in Medenine, and I am going to keep on working on it under all circumstances \u2026**\n\n**My fellowship was a great experience that helped me learn more about a lot of things, including my own project, and learning and self development is an endless process:**\n\n**So why not collaborate more in the future?

It is an open source plug-in for Drupal, and we use it to add semantic markup to edgeryders.eu content, empowering both our ethnographic research, website visitor's navigation and discovery, and semantic search engines. Open Ethnographer is developed by the Edgeryders LbG company, with the support of the Rockefeller Foundation.\n\n<strong>What's innovative?</strong> In contrast to existing <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-assisted_qualitative_data_analysis_software\">QDA software</a>, semantic markup (\"coding\") is not inserted into an offline copy of the online conversation, but right into the live content. This preserves the context, enabling extended analysis later. In addition, the semantic markup can be created collaboratively, the saved coding effort allowing more detailed research later. Lastly, the semantic markup can be public, enhancing the original author's content with semantic web integration \"for free\".

With our activities expanding and more opportunities presenting themselves, Edgeryders in 2018 seems to be close to one such situation. A few months back, it became clear that we needed to up our game if we were to overcome the challenges implied.\n\nBut we had one thing going for us. Edgeryders is not exactly an entity. It's always been more of a network, a set of relationships. Networks have no sharp borders between an \"inside\" and an \"outside\"; what they have is a _gradient_, from less central to more central. So, the default mode of growing is to pull closer to their center people who are _already_ in. This, we reasoned, can be effective and fast, but still quite safe, because we would be working closer with people we already know well, and have already worked with. With a community approaching five thousand members, this did not look impossible. \n\nSo, in late May a group of close collaborators and friends decamped to southern Turkey for a company retreat, dreamed up and organized by the wonderful @noemi. We rented a large house in the coastal town of Kalkan, and explored how we could work together to build on these past four years of Edgeryders, set ourselves new goals and live out new adventures.\n\nAt the and of three very intense days, I see the start of a new phase in the life of our wonderful little mutant of a community/company. The main changes are:\n\n* **Much larger and more diverse core group**. Several people could not make it to Turkey. And yet, there were thirteen people in the house, plus a facilitator. This is a much larger, stronger core than we ever could count on. Also more diverse: this group includes people in their twenties, other in their seventies, and every age group in between; there were people holding passports from 12 countries on four continents; and coming from different disciplines, including engineering, performing arts, philosophy, economics, architecture, design and business.\n* **Teams**. Working in Edgeryders happens in almost total autonomy. This is hugely enjoyable for most of us, but it can be disorienting, especially at first. We are encouraging the formation of small teams, whose members work quite closely with each other. Autonomous teams, we think, combine decentralization and resilience with a sense of shared purpose and camaraderie. The #research-network is the first formalized team in Edgeryders in this sense; we have several more in the making. My colleagues will be announcing them on the blog as we go. \n* **Process reform**. The new scale of Edgeryders means we need to rethink the way the run operations, while staying faithful to our principles of individual autonomy, mutual responsibility and resilient architecture. @matthias is leading the rethinking, but we will all be involved. Meanwhile, for the benefit of the larger groups, I had a first stab at writing down the [principles for collaboration](https://edgeryders.eu/t/principles-for-collaboration-and-operations-in-edgeryders/8729/1) underpinning Edgeryder's architecture and processes, both current and future.\n* **Induction and board enlargement**. We also had to come up with a process to onboard new people into the core group. We are doing it mostly with one-on-one mentoring by the standing board members. Some people have expressed interest in joining the board of directors, and we came up with a process for that too. \n\nIn the picture, left to right, you will find the smiling faces of @matteo_uguzzoni, @nadia, @hugi, @owen, @mariacoenen, @noemi, @alex_levene, @zmorda, @bob,  @anique.yael,  myself, @hazem and @johncoate.

Write like a journalist.When you\u2019re not precise and comprehensive, you create delays or interruptions in the future, or both.\n3. **Collaboration**: Asynchronous work as the new default. We can\u2019t stress this enough: by default head for asynchronous work (different place and different times).\n5. **Socialising**: For distributed teams, it\u2019s a conscious effort. Because it does not happen on its own anymore, but is essential for team health and frictionless communication.\n6. **Tools**: In a distributed setting, you cannot not use a tool. Because even when talking, you use a tool.\n7. **Organization Building**: More than working from home during Covid. When you can change more basic things in your organization around, use that power to become distributed-first.\n\n### You are already on your way! But you may need to slow down now, to go faster later...\n\nMost organisations and teams had to adopt some amount of remote working during Covid.\n\nIn general they took what they were doing offline into the online environment. The intuitive approach is to see work as being done in a constant dialogue, like in a room together \u2013 in a distributed environment that causes interruptions. For example when they make meetings to be zoom meetings, or worse, zoom meetings with post it notes.\n\n**So how to do distributed and remote work well?**   **Aspire towards a culture and management framework where asynchronous work is the default.**\n\nWhen people have the freedom to choose their own worktimes and are rarely interrupted by urgent demands or questions, that\u2019s a good indicator for an asynchronous work environment.\n\nHow the Edgeryders does it:\n\n1. Autonomy: Give collaborators high level of autonomy in managing their own time and workflow - goal oriented management. Use the least invasive successful way of management for everyone individually. Surveillance is expensive and counterproductive: you don\u2019t want to know their mouse position at each moment.\n2. Organisation manual: documenting is a skill (and mostly value-based). The onboarding process is cheap when your org is properly documented.\n3. Parallel work is what avoids interruptions: When you get blocked, switch to another task and wait until your colleague unblocks your progress. For that, we communicate tasks including their dependencies. Tools that allow to express these dependencies help.\n4. About tools: If you\u2019re happy with the tools you have, don\u2019t change a thing. But don\u2019t let yourself be forced to use tools that don\u2019t work for you and that you can\u2019t adapt for your purposes. We decided we rather want to trade some polish for the freedom of free software that allows us to shape our work environment.\n\n**Not every organisation can or should make the full transition to this model.**  But even taking a few small steps can make significant contributions to saving time and money and reducing mental strain.\nLearn more about how Edgeryders can help your organisation to adopt good practices for remote work and distributed organisations at [remote.edgeryders.eu](http://remote.edgeryders.eu/)", "created_at": "2020-12-02 19:29:32.445732", "updated_at": "2020-12-03 13:46:00.007675", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 543, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 21.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [88028], "is_liked_by": [5083], "is_private": false}, {"id": 772, "user_id": 3448, "topic_id": 739, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Autistic children have limited behaviours about social connections and they can easily get confused from hearing more than one sound when they are outside.

That being said, I'm slowly beginning to prepare them so I can acquaint. \n- As per the Design rationale, it seems it's time to discuss how this can be adapted to align with the **Horizon2020 financial reporting** templates I provided you with for ease of reporting to the Commission as we talked about. Or have I missed something?\n- Just to confirm I understand: the magic budget is for projects and the magic spreadsheet aggregates all project data together for company wide cashflow and accounting?\n- On first entry, it'd be good if there's more space for team members in the Overview for those that have bigger teams.

They may also find a second column or entry, dedicated to the money already paid to X or spent on travel.[/quote]\n\n    Our current plan ([here](https://dynalist.io/d/7aI9WsBWMMgCS2aablD9uIjT#z=dACbQz0ghBvq1DmCJQcQPeJ1)) for the budget spreadsheet is to allow to gradually refine a budget, from a rough version submitted in the first stage of proposals to a very detailed version at the end of the project. To refine it, one would take a budget position and add sub-level entries below it that sum up to the budget position. The last hierarchy level of these sub-level entries will always be actual expenses \u2013 one entry for one expense. If we go with this, preparing a payment request would mean that the project manager records a corresponding line in the budget spreadsheet, authorizing the expense by doing so. Then, the person making the payments will look this up, check if the total budget is not exceeded, make the payment and add the payment date back into the budget spreadsheet. (This will make the expense count into \"money spent so far\", and also include the expense with this date into the cashflow graph rather than a predicted date in another column.)\n\n3. If this process is acceptable (\"payment manager enters payment date into budget spreadsheet\"), it also solves a difficult issue that we had with the planned budget spreadsheet template so far: how to import expenses as CSV records back from FreeAgent into the spreadsheet ([details](https://dynalist.io/d/7aI9WsBWMMgCS2aablD9uIjT#z=wE2FZTvMQcgUhoJqoAB3Fh-c)). It needs some work to \"reconcile\" imported expense records with budget items, and I had no good idea how to do this with minimal work (once per expense record, not once per expense record and import). But that would be solved now! :)\n\n4. In addition to the payment date, the payment manager would enter a link to the FreeAgent record for the expense or bill.\n\n5. We might want to treat the budget spreadsheet as the \"payment task list\", without a need to notify the payment manager individually. Just fill the \"Payment requested now?\" column and wait. Notification e-mails might be send to the payment manager automatically.\n\n6. Later, to ease the job of the payment manager even more, we can create a one-click solution to fill a whole FreeAgent expense or bill form from a row copied from the spreadsheet (using [Form-o-Fill](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/form-o-fill-the-programma/iebbppibdpjldhohknhgjoapijellonp?hl=en) or similar). The same to fill the online banking form. (The person will still have to check the form before confirming it.)\n\nThis way, budget spreadsheets would become the original data source. There are some loose ends with such a setup, still: where to store the receipts and PDF invoices before they make it into FreeAgent, and how to deal with the fact that payment requests for reimbursement cover an arbitrary number of expense records in FreeAgent (so that there would not be a single place to look up the payment authorization). But these seem solvable.", "created_at": "2018-06-13 20:26:23.464036", "updated_at": "2018-06-13 22:21:07.529898", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 672, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 11.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [45592], "is_reply_to": [45592], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 41999, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 7122, "post_number": 16, "raw": "Notes from the \"P2P project sharing session\" on 2018-02-22 at OpenVillage House Sidi Kaouki, where we presented the two projects in the House to the other team.\n\n@m_tantawy: \n\n* First concern: The coffee sorter will change the lifestyle of people.

First, not managing NELIS  from the centre and allowing for autonomy; second, replacing that with community management, and third, showcasing incremental wins.

Do you think this is a role that you could mentor? Perhaps under the more immediate guidance of @shravan who is coordinating. \n\nBut even with this in place, it is extremely important for those at the local level to spur and instigate action in their own ecosystem as this is key to NELIS' success.

In my experience, the most difficult part of fostering these dynamics is finding the \"first mover\" entrepreneurial person in the periphery of the network, and helping them along. You need a poster child, someone to inspire the other people in your network. If people look at NELIS and perceive a strong central leadership (the secretariat or whatever), the best people will be inspired to join the center. If they see a swarming of cool, locally impactful initiatives they will be inspired to act in their locale.

Essentially all very centralized.\n\nIn contrast: once (bio)engineered and given the right nutrition to keep the organisms alive, you could have a \u201cliving library\u201d that is immediately deployable. \nAlso, a producer/designer/... who uses these materials becomes more independent of price, since using biofabrication is possibly infinitely scaleable: no precious raw materials are required and production could be decentralized from supplier because the complexity of producing materials will be performed by the organisms metabolism itself(assumption). \n\nSo no need to drive up the prices in the value chain due to earning back heavy investments in equipment (reactors,...) or limited availibility (geographic, volume,...)\n\nOn the condition biomaterials/biofabrication become on par with traditional materials on engineering point of view (structural, chemical stability, environmental durability, etc) I think this will actually shake up some economic models within manufacturing and thus the choices you will make as an engineer or designer, due to reduced cost and increased availibility. \n\nWhich means we\u2019ll actually find ways to embrace the new aesthetics of these materials. This is similar to the transition from wood, metal, stoneware to plastics in the beginning of the 1900s, where that new line of (cheaper) materials \u201ceconomically pushed\u201d towards designers/manufacturers led to new aesthetics in the following decades.", "created_at": "2018-06-20 19:25:20.317078", "updated_at": "2018-06-20 19:25:20.317078", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 292, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 74.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3362, 2095], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3426, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3393, "post_number": 1, "raw": "RF is back:\n\nhttp://www.100resilientcities.org/pages/100-resilient-cities-challenge\n\nDo we want to give it another try? <a href=\"/u/arthurd\">@ArthurD</a>? <a href=\"/u/lucasg\">@LucasG</a>?\n\nWe could even allocate the fundraising person to do some legwork..\n\n", "created_at": "2014-07-26 22:39:57", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:18.731314", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 51, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 80502, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 10273, "post_number": 27, "raw": "@MariaEuler and @marina I am updating everything here - what I am missing is the list of festival events - could you add them @marina ? @MariaEuler is busy with the event next week", "created_at": "2020-07-15 09:54:41.158417", "updated_at": "2020-07-15 09:54:41.158417", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 31, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 6.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 64372, "user_id": 4664, "topic_id": 11459, "post_number": 6, "raw": "hello, I missed a really important point during our call due to connection problems so I want to make sure everything is clear concerning our next steps. \n\nWe already had the Zindi Approval to host the competition in their platform.

In order to do that you have to request a verification with them via phone at least two days in advance, I did that with my personal account, so apparently we were ready to go.\nYoutube Live is using Hangout for the \"trasmission\" so basically it appears for the users as a Youtube page, but in the background the conversation is hosted on Hangout (Hangout on Air a version developed by Google just for this).\nLong story short, two hours before the webinar we started testing Hangout on Air with @owen and it wasn't working, at all!!\n\nAfter 30 minutes of trying we decided to test Crowdcast, one of the alternative out there, I've setup the account, -the free trial- (apparently no limitations), and we tested: it was working!\n\nSo I invited the guests to test the platform, share screen and whatever. We did the test and it was working, then we went live and BOOM/CRASH!\n\nThe system started glitching, with delay on the images and it was impossibile to share the screen for the presenter. \n\nSo @hugi made a big effort and make it trough half of his presentation, sharing the link on Drive of his doc, but then we had more then 20 people connected (wow!) and Crowdcast was costantly crashing :))\n\nLuckily Jessica (of the attendant) offered her Zoom pro account and we did the rest of the conversation in there (after a pause).\n\nWe will test all the solution that were suggested in the conversation, but reality is that only when you have 20+ people connected from all around the globe (with different connection band) that you will really test the technology.\nSo next step could be testing all the suggestions that emerged in the conversation and see if there is one that has all the features that we like (open source, +20 attendants, recording of the webinar, no plugin/installation required, etc..), maybe with the monthly call? (ping @zmorda and @anique.yael)  \n\n**Time zone:** that\u2019s was a big one and affected a lot the quality of the webinar, the stress of the guests and the participation of the attendants.\nWe decided to host the webinar late in the afternoon for a timing that was good for the two co-working space/partners that were helping us in the organization.\nSo the final time was 5 pm Tunisia and Morocco time zone, which, internationally is known as CET.\nBruxelles (CEST) is +1 compared to CET, so that will results at 6 pm.\n\nThe website took the time zone wrong and the countdown was ending at 5pm Bruxelles time, so we had half of the attendants ready to participate 1 hour BEFORE the other half of the attendants (partners from MENA region).\n\nAs @hugi said before going live, never ever trust the international time zone code, but always explicit the city that you are taking as a reference.\nWe are going to to that!!\n\n_\nThose were the things that weren\u2019t so good, but then we saw a lot of interaction happening and the conversation was, in my opinion, very interesting.\n\n_\n**Hosting:** From a personal point of view, being the host, I found the experience very similar to a live presentation from a stage in term of energy that you have to deliver, with the downside of not having live-feedback from your audience (eye-contact, nodding..) and that was super weird.\n\nI\u2019m not sure that I\u2019ve managed to summarize the answers to the questions at the end of every round (the three guests were answering round-table style to the questions emerging), because it was very hard to read all the written conversation AND listen to what was being said.\nIn television and radio they teach you to remember every now and then the topic that you are talking about so new-comers or people that get lost and distracted could enter again in the conversation, not sure the effect of doing this also in a webinar.\n\n\n**Questions and structure:** in order to share content also before the official start of the webinar, Hugi offered to share one presentation that he did one week ago, that was very useful and a good introduction. Maybe is something that we can repeate, is a good way to let people enter in the webinar without loosing the discussion.\n\nThen we had prepared a loose structure of questions preceded by a personal presentation from the guests.\nBut the interactions from the audience was really good and powerful that we basically answered what was on the comment sections and not looking at our structure.\nThen later I had a look at that and I saw that the questions from the participants were expanding the sequence of questions that we had written, but, because generated by actual experience, the questions were more interesting and the answers were useful instead of theorical.\n\n**Duration**: finally the webinar lasted 90 minutes for the MENA participants and 150 minutes (2h 1/2) for the first attendants.\n90 minutes is the length for this kind of event, also because at the end, speaking of myself, the energy was pretty low.\n\nBut yeah, that one was my first experience with that and a very positive one: interesting mix of being together with others, the energy of the interactions, the excitement of going \"live\", cool!\n\nIn the next days we will share the webinar's video, so stay tuned :)", "created_at": "2018-07-03 21:40:23.688383", "updated_at": "2018-07-04 08:44:47.758267", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 969, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 118.2, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 4566, 3703, 4085, 2569], "is_private": false}, {"id": 45860, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 8800, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Phew this was fun, thanks so much to everyone of the 25 or so people who attended.

You are looking at the conversation on stewardship that we developed in the runup to, during and after <a href=\"/en/lote4/welcome-to-lote4\">Living On The Edge 4 \u2013 The Stewardship</a>, the 4th meetup of the Edgeryders global community. It is a network representation of the conversation on the Edgeryders platform: participants are represented as dots, and interactions across them (in the sense of leaving comments to each other) are represented as arcs. The orange-colored part of the network represents participants involved in the stewardship conversation, and their interaction in the context of that conversation.\n\nThe conversation on stewardship brought together edgeryders who are highly central in the conversation, as well as quite a few low-connectivity individual \u2013 many of them are probably newcomers, that got involved in Edgeryders because they are interested in this specific topic. The central position occupied by the main orange clusters signals that stewardship is quite close to the heart of Edgeryders as a community.\n\nThe visualization was created reusing data generated to produce an <a href=\"/t/a-visual-more-tables-in-the-ethno-report/4293\">online ethnography of stewardship</a>. Besides stewardship being interesting in its own right, doing an ethnography on it allowed us to test <a href=\"/t/open-ethnographer/578\">Open Ethnographer</a>, a shiny new tool for online ethnography we developed for the Edgeryders platform. We acknowledge the support of the Rockefeller Foundation in building it, thank you guys!

To be honest, open source code does not solve the challenge that for powerful and stable video conferencing you need reliable high performance infrastructure backing it up, and infrastructure costs money.

At the same time, I am gathering that two priorities with further broadcasts like this are: \na) reliable video conferencing application and\nb) sharing the Edgeryders community - its approaches and techniques - at its best\n\nConsidering this, I think it is important that we do everything we can to extend our commitment to open source technologies to public broadcasts and the Academy.

I'm probably not remembering details exactly - but it shouldn't matter for the general idea. I offer it as inspiration.\n\nThe story takes place in a UK university where for some reason a student checked the situation of large oak beams that supported the ceiling of a very large 400 year old hall. He found that there was rot and issued a warning. The university discussed the subject and were very worried that it would be impossible in this day and age to find such massive substitute beams.\n\nDuring the meetings/discussions it turned out that the university had a forest manager - someone who was in charge of looking after numerous forest areas that belonged to the university. They called him in and asked him what to do and he calmly replied that there is no problem. When the hall was originally built, 400 years ago, oak trees were planted to grow alternate beams - since it was obvious to those involved in the construction that eventually the massive beams would need to be replaced. And indeed, for 400 years, those forests have been managed, the trees looked after and growing and waiting for someone to ask for replacement beams.\n\nCheers to you for raising the bar staring into the future.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-10-07 17:29:23", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:41.463407", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 245, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1438, 1457], "is_private": false}, {"id": 80276, "user_id": 4022, "topic_id": 13292, "post_number": 89, "raw": "It remains to be seen.

So I'll offload them here, and leave it to you to find anything of value in there :smile:\n\nThis time, the ideas are for the Southern Mediterranean region, otherwise often called the \"MENA region\". If you're interested in even more ideas, have a look at my previous list: [Seventy-One New Business Ideas for Nepal](/t/id/5712).\n\nNote that my inspirations are largely from [our project in Sidi Kaouki](/tags/project-sidi-kaouki) (Southern Morocco, right at the Atlantic coast) and our various [activities in Medenine](https://edgeryders.eu/search?q=medenine) (interior Southern Tunisia), attracted by @Yosser's space [OurGhema](https://www.facebook.com/OurGhema-372596423158704/). \n\n\n## The List\n\n#### (1) Colorful pavement blocks from recycled plastic\n\nWe had an issue in Sidi Kaouki: there was no trash collection, so [lots of plastic was laying around](/t/id/7961/11). However, the plastic can also be collected from the beach, informal trash yards, the roadside etc. and used as a raw material.\n\nThe idea to utilize the plastic must be able to deal with large amounts of mixed plastic with little worktime, so the [Precious Plastic](https://preciousplastic.com/) machines are not that suitable. But how about this:\n\nRoughly clean and sort the plastic (by type and color), grind it, mix it with bright beach sand, and bake or extrude it into pavement blocks of about 20\u00d710\u00d710 cm. They will all have slightly different colors due to the different plastic mix in each, letting people create nice colorful courtyards etc..\n\n\n#### (2) Digital mapping service for businesses etc.\n\nThis is about \"putting you city on the digital map\", by collecting, digitizing and updating information about businesses, tourist attractions etc.. There are various ways to run this as a business, for example: \"entry is free, update costs money\".\n\nWith @yosser and @zmorda we're in the initial phases of [organizing this in Medenine](/t/id/8780), and we also have [a technical manual](/t/id/9067) for it.\n\n\n#### (3) Producing water filters for the home from clay\n\n\n#### (4) Low-cost solar desalinators for the home\n\nCoastal regions around the Mediterranean sea have access to a lot of seawater and sunshine, which they can be used to distill water for drinking, gardening etc.. I have not yet seen any homes using low-tech solar stills there, so here is that idea.\n\nFor instructions, see for example the booklet \"[Simple Solar Still for the Production of Distilled Water](http://www.fastonline.org/CD3WD_40/JF/JF_VE/SMALL/16-374.pdf)\" (1965, 9 pages). The device described there can produce ca. 3 l per day with an area of 120\u00d750 cm.\n\n\n#### (5) Custom stone structures from interlocking CNC cut stones\n\nThis is a potentially unrealistic idea to make use of the enormous amounts of natural stones lying around in arid and wind-eroded areas.\n\nIt starts with creating a 3D CAD design of a structure one wants to build, and that can use all kinds of fancy shapes. The computer will then calculate what stone blocks would be needed to build this; these would be both cuboid blocks and those in irregular shapes for vaults, adjacent to vaults etc..\n\nThen, there would be a 5-axis CNC controlled tool with a large diamond cutting blade, cooled with water. Such a blade needs way less machine complexity than a water jet cutter, and allows to create shapes (like zig-zag cross-section grooves) that are not possible with a waterjet. The maintenance and replacement costs will be similar to that of a waterjet cutter after finding the best supplier for the blades (probably a Chinese manufacturer) and ordering large volumes at once directly from the factory.\n\nThe machine will then scan a boulder / natural stone put inside, calculate what to use it for, and cut that shape out of it. It would engrave numbers on all its faces; each number is used on one face each of two stones only, telling to connect these faces when building the structure. This way, the structure / building is simple to assemble: make a foundation, start with the first stone, and connect the other stones as told by the face numbers.\n\n\n#### (6) Weather resistant bicycles for coastal regions\n\nBicycles really suffer in salty air, but that can be minimized: use only aluminium, use a rubber belt instead of a chain etc..\n\n\n#### (7) Date coffee for the international market\n\nYou should talk to @islem about this, it's actually her idea :)\n\n\n#### (8) Surf boards made from recycled plastic\n\nSurfboards have to be made with foam on the inside, but this could perhaps be produced with thermoplastic that is mixed with baking powder (or another gasing agent ) and then heated.\n\n\n#### (9) Trash collection robot for beaches\n\n\n#### (10) Silent vertical wind generators for rooftops\n\nThere is a _lot_ of strong, consistent wind on the Moroccan Atlantic coast. And while they are starting to build large wind turbines now (for example around Essaouira), houses don't use wind power yet.\n\nHowever, since the wind is so strong and consistent, even small wind turbines could be economical in these places (which they are not in a lot of other places).\n\nTo make a small wind turbine as unobtrusive as possible for use in settlements, it should cast no changing shadows and visually not change colors when rotating. Some types of vertical wind turbines fulfill these criteria.\n\n\n#### (11) Retrofit insulation for houses from recycled plastic\n\nThe plastic would be extruded into fine fibers. Plastic fibers are used as insulation in sleeping bags, so it should work for homes, too.\n\nAnd it's not only about keeping the warmth in, more about keeping the heat out during the summer.\n\n\n#### (12) Solar room heating\n\nWhen it's getting cold in rural Morocco, people burn wood. However, the sky is usually clear in winter, so on most days rooms could be heated by having large thermal solar collectors outside.\n\nIf necessary, a heat storage that covers a few days could be added.\n\n\n#### (13) Soilmaking\n\nCollect kitchen trash and any other biodegradable trash from cities, compost it, and mix the compost with sand, crushed stone, wood ash or whatever else it needs to become fertile soil.\n\nMany areas in windy southern Morocco are heavily eroded, which means, in need of new soil. In the coastal areas, agriculture would be pretty well possible if there would be soil (and if it would be properly protected from the wind by permanent vegetation, i.e. using permaculture).\n\n\n#### (14) Wiki for government processes\n\nGovernment processes in Morocco were quite obscure and it was difficult to find out what to do at all to (for example) extend a visa or legalize a rent contract. Probably it is similar in Tunisia, Egypt etc..\n\nThis is an opportunity for a startup: document the processes in a wiki-style website, perhaps funded by a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/) user base (that can include supporters from institutions and government).\n\nThere was a very interesting initiative like that in Nepal at one time, called [NaliBeli](https://feedbacklabs.org/blog/a-wiki-for-navigating-the-nepali-bureaucracy/).\n\n\n#### (15) Custom small wooden boxes\n\nMade-to-order website [for furniture](https://www.regaltischlerei.de/), [for flightcases](https://www.google.com/search?q=flightcase+made+to+order), for custom hydraulic hoses etc. are are regular sight in Europe now.\n\nHowever, there is nothing yet for small custom boxes, for example made from wood, with various inner compartments as needed for the instruments or objects to store.\n\nThat's a business opportunity for areas in the Southern Mediterranean region that have skilled carpenters, such as Essaouira, Morocco, and its surrounding villages.\n\nA startup would set up a website with an online configurator to collect the orders, and forward them to the craftspeople (for example by handing them an automatically printed blueprint in 1:1 size). Then the startup comes back later, purchases the object, and sells it with a surplus to the original customer in Europe. This needs direct parcel shipment, obviously. \n\nIn addition to wood, alternative materials are acrylic, glass and various plastic sheet materials.\n\n\n#### (16) PET greenhouse\n\nPET seems quite UV resistant and is certainly more wind resistant than the PE film used for polytunnel greenhouses. So there should be a way to connect shingles made from PET bottles together to create sturdy greenhouses.\n\n\n#### (17) Plastic floor and wall tiles\n\nMade from recycled plastic. With nice textures by mixing different colors.\n\nSee the similar idea \"(1) Colorful pavement blocks from recycled plastic\" above.\n\n\n#### (18) Building blocks made from natural stones encased in plastic\n\nThe stone will show on both sides of the wall, but the other sides are made even by molding plastic around the stone (and through it, by drilling 20-30 mm holes through it before). The plastic case will have interlocking elements like LEGO.\n\nWith these building blocks, buildings, garden walls etc. can be built quite easily, and even in a re-configurable way. The plastic is of course made from waste plastic.\n\n\n#### (19) Art broker\n\nThere are quite several artists in Morocco who remain quite poor because they are not connected to enough paying customers.\n\nThere is an opportunity for a startup that would offer works of local artists on the Internet, manage the sales and shipment, and collect a fee for that service.\n\n\n#### (20) Night bus service with beds\n\nA new and comfortable travel option that does not yet exist. In the absence of long-distance railways, it would allow a new, climate-friendly alternative to air travel. For example \"Essaouira to Tangier\" in one day.\n\n\n#### (21) Vehicle mounted machine to produce gravel and interlocking pavement blocks\n\nPeople would just feed in stones they find in the local area onto a conveyor belt. The machine analyzes them (hardness, 3D scan) and where possible cuts a pavement block from them. Where that is not possible, the stone is made into gravel; the same is done with all cut-offs. The machine would be mounted on a truck, for example a small container on a pickup truck.\n\nSuch a machine is able to produce everything needed to make a street. Gravel would be produced in two or three different types of coarseness, as needed for a streets. The machine would move along slowly, leaving a complete street behind.\n\n\n#### (22) Biogas plants\n\nNo need for distributing LPG bottles anymore.\n\n\n#### (23) Unbreakable bicycles and a mobile bicycle workshop\n\nIn villages, even getting a bicycles repaired is difficult as there is often no local bicycle workshop. So in rural Morocco, everyone drives around on broken bicycles, or rides a donkey.\n\nMaking or upgrading bicycles in a way so they don't break would fix most of that. An off-road truck that visits villages twice a year and carries a mobile bicycle workshop would fix the rest.\n\nUnbreakable bicycles would have to include unbreakable bicycle lighting (made from 3D printed, open source parts) and thorn resistant bicycle tires (already existing as \"touring tires\", but there should be a way to make these cheaper).\n\n\n#### (24) Stone collection tools\n\nIn arid or wind-eroded areas in the Southern Mediterranean region, there are a gazillion stones lying on each field, in various sizes from ca. 1 to 30 cm. \"Harvesting\" them would yield a great raw material for gravel, sand and for stone cutting and masonry. However, collecting them by hand is probably less efficient than having a quarry and would not be done.\n\nAs a solution, a robot could collect them. Or (more realistically) tools for people that make it more efficient to collect these stones, such as grippers for large stones, a collection stick for small stones and an electrical, off-road wheel barrow that can carry 250 kg of stones even on a sandy path.\n\n\n#### (25) Stone slicer for building stone walls\n\nA machine that would slice natural stones and boulders into standard thicknesses (2 cm, 4 cm, 8 cm, 16 cm) and optionally also cut them to a standard depth. Another machine would create grooves on the flat top and bottom surfaces of these stone slices, allowing mortar to stick to them properly or even to simply glue them together with no need for mortar (using a zigzag groove pattern with narrow tolerances).\n\nThis will result in nice-looking stone walls as their outer surface is still looking like natural stone. The inner surface will be either cut (good inside homes for cleanliness) or also natural. The walls will have a more orderly look though as the stones are laid in layers, and they will be faster to build.\n\n\n#### (26) Water delivery robot\n\nMany villages have one or a few wells in this area. The government is trying to connect households to water supply, but this is a challenge and quite expensive.\n\nGiven the current advancements in self-driving vehicles etc., another solution seems possible and could be more economical: a self-driving water delivery robot. It would move slowly (ca. 6 km/h) and only at night (to be most safe for others), and would be electrically operated to not annoy people. It would carry 2000 - 4000 l of water at once, visit pre-mapped refill tubes of houses and pump water into each until the tank of the house is full again.\n\n\n#### (27) Hill gardening robot\n\nIn Morocco and Tunisia, there is quite some land on hills that could in principle be farmed, but is difficult to do. In Asia and Southern America, terracing has been done in such cases (also for erosion protection).\n\nBut there might be another option now: a robot that can drive on two narrow footpaths at once, one uphill and one 2-6 m downhill. The two parts of the farming robot would be connected with a beam that holds the farming tool attachments which can move along the beam.\n\nOf course, the question is still how to deal with soil erosion in such a setup.", "created_at": "2019-01-13 16:10:59.007885", "updated_at": "2019-05-05 17:29:24.831941", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2336, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 237.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3904, 2095], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7755, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 4343, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>There is no problem</b>\n\nThe bug is not as you describe.

The barons of capital will do everything in their power to make sure they stay on top draining everyone else of their resources.\n\nBut that will not fly this time.  Even if there is enough white solidarity to return Trump and his GOP toadies to office in November, infection, unemployment, racial tension - it will get worse, not better.

Examples of mission are \"put a manned mission on the Moon's surface\" and \"split the atom to discover the universe's fundamental structure\".

Is this society feasible if its population are shaped by a mixture of normative influences, walkaway and non-walkaway? \n* Likewise abundance or postscarcity sometimes feel like quite \"all or nothing\" concepts. Is it necessarily so?

Are there side effects that the novel doesn't anticipate? \n* Would we expect any kind of cyclicality in such an economy?\n\nIn regard to the last question, I guess it would be great to think about links with platform co-operativism, but I'll try to think of a more concrete example.\n\nHope that makes sense, I'm melting on a train and not even sure who I am any more", "created_at": "2018-07-26 14:33:22.297406", "updated_at": "2018-07-26 14:33:22.297406", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 251, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 313.8, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [46378], "is_liked_by": [3904, 3, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12429, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1360, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Never enough!</b>\n\nOne course is never enough, in any learning environment, is it?

I have three remarks.\n\n\n### 1. Extending the codes data structure to support codebooks in OpenEthnographer\n\nThis seems not to be a problem. Right now, a code in OE looks like this:\n\n```\n{\n    id: 13,\n    name: \"accessible laboratories\",\n    description: null,\n    creator_id: 3323,\n    created_at: \"2017-09-05T16:09:52.870Z\",\n    updated_at: \"2017-09-05T16:09:52.870Z\",\n    ancestry: null\n}\n```\nCodes are stored in their own table in the Discourse database. Adding fields should be very simple \u2013 we already have a `description` field (corresponds to your long description), that was hardly ever used. \n\nMore problems arise when codes are modified. In your example, the memos are added with time, and the second one even refers to a change in the code's denomination. This looks like a revision history to me. Might it make sense to \"wikify\" codes? Should we, like in wikis, allow people other than the author of a code to modify it? Should we stick to free text fields, or even just one that gets edited over time? \n\nOn the side: the second memo might also refer to a change not in the code, but in the annotation; the `ship speed` code lived on and was used elsewhere; but in the post where Luke is talking about distancing the other ship it was changed to `insufficient ship speed`. Of course the ethnographer knows this, but here we assume that the codebook is going to be read by people other han her, like me. Open codebook ethnography is meant resolve these ambiguities in the interests of collaboration. \n\n\n### 2. The codebook\n\nShould the codebook be itself a database object? Once upon a time, @matthias had proposed something called a \"collection\", which would be a set of codes used for the purpose of one study. Then, I think, he changed his mind. You could also define a codebook indirectly, by running a database query like this:\n\n```\ngive me all codes that\n   {\n      are contained in posts bearing the tag: \"#ethno-poprebel\",\n      and whose authors are: (\"amelia\" and \"ivan\")\n   }\n```\nThis is elegant, but it has two problems:\n\n1. Not clear how the `codebook` tab would be created in the user interface, because maybe I want to see Amelia's codes but not Ivan's. You would have to have a kind of wizard to generate the codebook. There is a hint of this with the \"toggle view other people's codes\" right now.\n\n2. I may want to include some, but not all, of Amelia's posts in my own study. This would call for a codebook to be indeed associated to a study. Then, codes and content can be associated to it. This is a much more substantial modification to OE, either way.\n\n\n### 3. Network-based similarity between codes\n\nYour point 7 made me think of a neat trick we might use to _compute_ codes similarity. Just think of the semantic network as an n-dimensional grid of length 1, with the connection to each code mapped onto a dimension. Each code's distance from every other code is either zero (not connected) or one (connected). Taking any two codes, you can then compute their [cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity). This works best with highly connected codes in large networks, though. Also, it might be more appropriate for a data analysis phase than for the coding phase.\n\nI love your example based on Star Wars! :smile:", "created_at": "2018-07-23 13:17:23.094211", "updated_at": "2019-03-07 23:48:18.142330", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 570, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 27.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 88701, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 14987, "post_number": 36, "raw": "but I would tag the posts directly so we can just generate the list when we do a search and it is alot less work for you", "created_at": "2020-12-09 10:17:44.136985", "updated_at": "2020-12-09 10:17:44.136985", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 27, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 12.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [88698], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 81566, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 13926, "post_number": 75, "raw": "I propose you look for an answer on [meta.discourse.org](https://meta.discourse.org/).

Hence, here my comments on matters that do not need knowing the letter:\n\n(1) Indeed asking for re-evaluation does make sense only if a major distortion of the evaluation process is detected. In the given circumstance, it seems useful to know whether the coordinator (in hind-cast) shares the perception that the ' * methodology does not credibly define how the participants in the online conversation will be identified and recruited or how many participants are envisaged.*' or whether s/he recognises that the information about methodology was not placed with appropriate visibility in the proposal.   \n\n(2) With noticeable difference to the situation 30 years ago, today EU services have very limited say in the findings of the evaluation of a given proposal. EU Member states did insist to trust their nationals that work as experts, and did dislike EU services having influence in the evaluation outcome of a given proposal. Hence, the essential bit in proposal writing is to get the information *\"out to the experts*\".   \n\n(3)  Furthermore, what I wrote under (2) applies in most cases also for the relative ranking of the proposals. This implies, considering the variability of evaluation findings that the relative sequence of 'good proposals' has an element of randomness. Nevertheless, most very good and morst very bad proposals make it clearly into the top and bottom box, respectively. The relative ranking of a good proposal has little 'qualifying power'. \n\n(4)  During the last decade, the share of high-quality proposals was such that *\"less than 50% could be funded\"*; that is, many high-quality proposals got rejected. \n\nI know that my comments do not help with the disappointment. Also, saying that you have to write *outstanding* proposal to maximise your chances does not help. Likewise, considering proposal submission to be a lottery does not help. \n\nSo what to do, in future? Difficult to advise.

This led me to the discovery of a few discrepancies:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>The first one is the reference to unexisting users as posts and comments authors. The view I am currently using (opencare_users_rename) is a clone of the old one (opencare_users) where the fields are simply renamed.\u00a0This issue concerns 139 posts and 635 comments (plus cascading responses) so that's quite a bit of them. I am wondering whether the problem may come from the filtering parameters as currently we select group_ID=4260 whereas other views select group_ID=5954. Could you validate which group ID we need to consider?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>The second issue I have encountered is the triplication of some comments (old ones, published before 2015 apparently) and posts (only differing on according to their group definition). This is not really a big problem for the comments but not so for the posts as only one group ID is supposed to be defined per post (or at least I thought so?). Is this normal or should we further refine the views?</li>\n\n</ul>", "created_at": "2016-09-30 17:08:23", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:32.229870", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 205, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 46522, "user_id": 3904, "topic_id": 8908, "post_number": 6, "raw": "I think this speaks to a key point in terms of what we want the reading group to be and how we see it evolving accordingly. I come from a background of reading groups that are unstructured - from room arrangements to conversational flow - to allow for the many different ways in which people think access into the collective knowledge sharing. \n\nFor me reading groups are unique spaces of collective study and merit as much space for emergence and flow as possible. Platforms like conversational threads leading up to and after the reading group are useful and offer more structured paths for the thinking to take shape. But in the actual room itself I hesitate to create too much structure.\n\nThat's my two cents and as always very committed to collectively creating a learning space responsive to the unique approaches and needs of the group at hand. \n\nAs for tech, this is why having the chat open is a useful tool too. As we saw with Lise, some people are more comfortable contributing that way (ie. when I read out her comments); and what can happen is that separate conversations take place there too, and then spill into the room. The intersections can become quite fun!\n\nWe also had Beatrice join for the first third and @jolwalton come in the final minutes.", "created_at": "2018-07-28 14:18:21.555956", "updated_at": "2018-07-28 14:18:47.476433", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 222, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 52.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [46510], "is_liked_by": [1935], "is_private": false}, {"id": 46533, "user_id": 3362, "topic_id": 8910, "post_number": 4, "raw": "They, and we, are in touch :) Michael has been quite active in the biohacking community, he was also at the global summit in Boston in September and at the Biofabbing conference in Geneva", "created_at": "2018-07-30 10:14:05.285675", "updated_at": "2018-07-30 10:14:05.285675", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 33, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 72.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [46521], "is_liked_by": [1856, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 46495, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 8910, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Came across this and thought immediately of opencare.

It is one of the noisiest and most polluted cities as well. There are lots of stories in between its different layers, but this is not a story about Cairo, its about the ones who are escaping it building a new life outside.\n\nBeing the capital of a highly centralized country, Cairo is usually where most Egyptians migrate to in order to find work, studies, and different opportunities. However lately more  people are trying to leave Cairo and experience another way of life in smaller settlements \u2013 in places like Dahab, Fayoum, Siwa, Nuweiba- Some are privileged enough to be able to leave and \u201cwalk away\u201d showing the road to others who want to follow in their footsteps.\n\nIn this small [video report](https://vimeo.com/239618020) (English translation is available) for example, two young people explain why they are living in Dahab. After obtaining their university degrees from Cairo they decided to leave the capital and go live in the small town of Dahab in southern Sinai. Dahab became lately an attraction point for young freelancers in Egypt, was mentioned several times during some discussions on the platform and is where @imake lived for a short while just before joining us in Sidi Kaouki. Also, @m_tantawy  as I remember stayed there for short while as well.\n\nIn Nuweiba, a much more daring project is going on right now. It is called [Dar Jan](https://www.facebook.com/DarJanForce1/) (House of Jan) where a couple decided to \u201cquit the big city and corporate life and move to Neweibaa in the desert of Sinai between mountains and the sea\u201d bought a piece of land to build and farm on. They are working hard in steady steps towards a healthier, calmer way of life. \n\nOn a quick call with the lovely couple, they explained a bit their journey and how they imagine their space as a space of sharing knowledge, productive space, a farm, an art and crafts space,  space for local community engagement, and above all a home. As you can see it is kinda in line with the OpenVillage vision.\n\nChoosing this life is a conscious decision, it is not an easy pathway as well, they are as well facing different challenges and need to attract genuine people who are interested in co-creation and meaningful collaboration.\n\nBeing remote is not easy, the small coastal town is facing different challenges as well, one of them that we touched upon during our call is the huge amounts of plastic waste, this is something that they see themselves that they can contribute back to the local community where they are staying. Still, it is not easy to build the \"[Precious Plastics](https://preciousplastic.com/)\" machines in a remote place without nearby fabrication machines (plus other problems that one usually face in daily life while being based in remote small town, some of us had some experience in this during our stay in Sidi Kaouki).\n\nThey are passionate about what they do, and want to share their knowledge and experience as well. They see the value of open source documenting of what they do so that their model could be easily replicated and updated, and are interested to join us here in Edgeryders to start their own wiki.\n\nI am sure that a lot of people from the Edgeryders community would find this interesting and would love to contribute as well to Dar Jan, whether by doing [toys form trash workshops](/t/id/6687/17) (@HadeerGhareeb), to [recycling and composting](/t/id/6755/14) (@MonicaZacharia) to self sufficiency technology (@matthias) or by building from local materials (@m_tantawy) \u2026 etc..\n\nI believe it is a good chance for collaboration in general and sharing it here makes sense as we are discussing repeatedly here different scenarios of [walking away](/t/id/8828/3) and building new economies or engaging with the status quotrying to change it (or \"Exit vs. Voice\" as @alberto describes it in [this post](/t/id/7633/11)).\n\n\n---\n\n## :ar: **_Arabic version_** <a

Some of those gray nodes there are super-active Edgeryders members like myself and @matthias. We interact across many different conversations hosted on the platform, but not all of them are represented. Only the ones relative to the two projects are, and they belong to either one or the other project. The color-coding choices mean to represent a dataset where the *interactions* only pertain to one project, but the *interacting participants* might be participating in one, or the other, or both. You can also think of this as a two-layer multiplex, but since most nodes belong only to one of thew layers a 2-D representation is intuitive. \n\nIn turns, this representation has a social science interpretation. This: there are people who participate in one debate who are also exposed to the other. Generalizing (which I can actually do by computing a whole-platform interaction network), that means that there is at least the possibility that relevant knowledge could be \"transported\" from one conversation to the next, carried by people who participate in both. **In other words, you have the possibility of an efficient collective intelligence engine:** a new project attracts domain specialists, who only participate in the one project, but also some generalists with historical memory of what happened before. The latter can point to relevant contributions made in the past, re-involve people that made them, etc. \n\n[quote=\"brenoust, post:4, topic:15080\"]\nYou could use a word2vec modeling as we did together back in Milan to measure the distance of codes, or use a Burt\u2019s approach (coming back to the roots of layer entanglement, with his article Relation Content in Multiple Networks). You can also get interested in using entanglement itself, it has been publicly release on py3plex (and I can give you something on Tulip if you want).\n[/quote]\n\nAs I recall it, we were not so happy with word2vec... are you referring to the work done by that Spanish researcher? But that was in Bordeaux, no? I am not familiar with that Burt article, I will look it up. And about entanglement... good idea, how would you describe the rationale for using it in this case? I am looking for paths to reduction whose rationale is (1) theoretically grounded, and (2) fairly intuitive to anthro/ethno researchers. \n\n@yudhanjaya, you surprised me! Here is something else we have in common besides starships exploding in deep space. Is that Tulip I'm looking at? :wink:\n\nI am not sure the method you propose here is applicable to codes co-occurrence networks. These are not social networks, nodes are ethnographic codes. What is your thinking?\n\n@brenoust  Here is a quick hack based on setting \"interpolate color\" to \"on\" in the scene.

Is it in a subject domain that we know about? Was it created by someone we're connected to? Do I recognize some topics on the map that are relevant / of interest? Does the description give a clue about the purpose of the authors? Basically, that's the process of discovering the latent links between your own working \"map\" (point of reference or line of inquiry) and what you see in front of you on the canvas which was created by some peers. If there is no obvious connection, then most likely you pass on by and forget it. But if at least some of the topics are relevant, then perhaps you start there and see what is connected to them on that map, or else deeper in the system (the \"topic view\" approach mentioned above). You don't need to process or comprehend the whole thing at once to interact and find value there. Although, it's certainly nice when that happens easily, which is part of the skill in building really great maps for the purposes of presentation and broad engagement. Same with authoring a blog post, or an infographic, or...most any media.\n\nI think we are starting to see different \"modes\" of mapping, some of which are very divergent and exploratory (and hence probably hard to parse for a visitor - like a \"brainstorm\") and some which are very clean, elegant, convergent, and generic, like a refined diagram to illustrate a particular concept, narrative, or dynamic. Soon we'll have a better implementation of \"favorites\" leading to \"featured maps\" which should reveal more of the latter, up front for curious visitors.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-03-09 16:27:20", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:48.592671", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 299, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [19425], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 86637, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 13292, "post_number": 199, "raw": "Progressives can't win using violence.

Is this really needed? The problem with the LOTE3 minisite is, it's a bad thing in terms of user navigation: users arrive at some site that does not share anything (no menu, no header) except the domain with the rest of the Edgeryders site, yet are told in the process to register at the Edgeryders site. And from there they will not have a link back to the minisite ... . That's confusing.\n\nI'd propose to put the edgeryders.eu mainsite menu back in the minisite, which means that the minisite menu will be seen as a second-level menu bar. Then link the LOTE3 main menu item to the minisite instead of the \"Making LOTE3\" group, and add a menu item for \"Making LOTE3\" to the minisite's second level menu bar.

My approach to this is slow but effective. In Athens I spent about a year getting to know people, as many as I could working in very different areas and from all different cultures and countries. I would call this \"Taking Inventory\" or Auditing. I met hundreds of people and listened. Listening to people is important. Also remembering what they say. When someone say they have an arc welder in their garage that they are not using, remember that, write it down! Then when you meet someone trying to build bike trailers for moving things in the city (for example), you know where to send them. It would also help to meet someone who knows how to weld. If you don't know anyone who knows how to weld, find them. If you don't know anyone who know how to do things with their hands, then I suggest changing scenes for a while.\n\nAt the time I was auditing, I didn't know what projects I wanted to do in Athens, but eventually some came ideas came up and when I needed resources, I knew where to ask for them, and who to connect with to get things done. It's like having an endless bank account, because everyone benefits from these things, especially if they make money. It takes a lot of time, concentration and inspiration, but once you build of network like this, it's almost like having funding without money.\n\nI could give more examples of this during the workshop?", "created_at": "2015-06-19 11:38:16", "updated_at": "2017-09-10 23:10:56.250447", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 270, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [21775], "is_liked_by": [2580, 2738], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22887, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 3977, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Taking over</b>\n\nGoing to work on this now in the RQDA variant.

I took a look---- I understand now that we don't have room for the more extended example. So it looks like we stick to the very quick one about stress and the means of relieving it.\n\nI don't think we have the space in the paper to go into a more detailed discussion of conclusions about OpenCare itself, since the paper seems to have taken the form of a methodological summary/argument for an approach. Like you say, instead we indicate how one might go about using this for analysis.\n\nI could add a sentence describing a very wide conclusion (In OpenCare, it [the co-occurrence network) has allowed us to theorise that people are each other's healthcare technologies) or something along those lines---- the issue, as I see it, is that we have a series of conclusions thus far that have emerged from the complexity of the onsite interactions, illuminated by the co-occurrence graph. These were in part detailed in the prelim findings post, but they're in other posts as we've been going along as well. It strikes me as better to gesture to the method of analysis rather than presenting a very small subsection of our specific analytical conclusions based upon the OC data.\n\nOn the bright side, it means that we could have an entire other paper that just details the richness of the ethnographic findings as illuminated by the co-occurrence graph. Content + methodology, but heavy on the content! Obviously this is what the ethnographic report will be, but I could also express it in journal article form and tease out a central argument.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-06-24 17:54:44", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:07.187368", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 287, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [22817], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 46876, "user_id": 3904, "topic_id": 8972, "post_number": 3, "raw": "[quote=\"hugi, post:1, topic:8972\"]\nAs Edgeryders moves into having physical locations and branches, it's probably wise to have it as a rule of thumb that a branch should bear its own overhead cost in normal circumstances.\n[/quote]\n\nGreat point. \n\nAnd congrats on getting this off the ground :seedling:", "created_at": "2018-08-24 09:56:18.408936", "updated_at": "2018-08-24 09:56:18.408936", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 51, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 68.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [46873], "is_reply_to": [46873], "is_liked_by": [4022], "is_private": false}, {"id": 46868, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 8971, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2018-08-23 21:00:29.643453", "updated_at": "2018-09-03 19:22:11.211957", "deleted_at": "2018-09-03 19:23:56.166874", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23135, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1946, "post_number": 23, "raw": "<b>Wow!</b>\n\nWow, [Ben] lots of stuff to process in your comment.

Meanwhile, let me make a technical point about the list of things that could go into the landing strip (by the way: what would you call it? Think a single word we can put in the main menu).\n\nIn Drupal, a page is very much like a post, except it does not \"roll over\" as more recent pages are produced, as posts do. You can put into it static HTML, but not PHP. So, text, images and embedded media are OK but anything dynamic, that requires querying the database and printing the result to the screen, is not. Your 3rd and 6th bullet points are of the latter kind, as are the 1st and 2nd from my own list.\n\nThere is a different kind of page that does enable you to incorporate the stuff returned from DB queries: it is called System Page (<a href=\"/people\">example</a>). You have an admin account, so you can build one; but it is not a very linear process, and it requires at a minimum that you use Views and Panelizer. How good are you at Drupal? If you are not confident you can crack it alone, maybe [Dorotea], [Auli] or I could help.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-09-15 17:17:02", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:08.461191", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 233, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [20640], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 46914, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 8972, "post_number": 10, "raw": "\n\n@Hugi - you found yourself a pretty amazing place I have to say! \nDo you have a plan to live there as well?

This will will see us starting two Horizon2020 projects double the size of OPENCARE each from 2019 - 2021. It will also see Edgeryders in full flight and you are invited to join in.\n\nThe first project is **POPREBEL,** as briefly introduced in [this post](https://edgeryders.eu/t/poprebel-win-get-ready-for-edgeryding-populism-from-2019/8870) and a research project to address populism and boost democratic engagement\n\nThe second project is **NGI Forward**, and is a part of the topic _Next Generation Internet - An Open Internet Initiative_. It's focused on \"developing a more human-centric Internet supporting values of openness, cooperation across borders, decentralisation, inclusiveness and protection of privacy; giving the control back to the users in order to increase trust in the Internet.\" You can read more on the topic [here](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/topics/ict-24-2018-2019.html). Edgeryders is a key member in the project focused on harnessing collective intelligence to inform long term strategies and policies for the future of the internet. As you can imagine, THIS IS EPIC. \n\nWe'll be sharing more on both projects once grant agreements are signed, and taking it slow to prepare but drop us a line below if you're interested in learning more and why. \n\nFor now, this is just a little heads up that Edgeryders is scaling and that from 2019 this space is going to spark.\n\n_[Image credit: Richard B Clark \"Peacock\"]_", "created_at": "2018-08-24 12:08:46.563007", "updated_at": "2018-08-26 12:40:50.124072", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 283, "wiki": false, "reads": 35, "score": 647.0, "like_count": 8, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4265, 4022, 4034, 4633, 4, 5, 3362, 3521], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24343, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 3055, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>this is what Alberto is talking about now:</b>\n\nhttp://www.slideshare.net/haiku66/online-conversation-as-foresight\n\n", "created_at": "2014-06-25 12:51:31", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:14.947185", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 21, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24564, "user_id": 2201, "topic_id": 5170, "post_number": 9, "raw": "Ok so, I talked to my friend and he will be joining us on the 27th (hope he will stay longer and attend some of our sessions too as he's really cool and got lots of fuckup stories to share)!\n\n<a href=\"/u/kiravde\">@KiraVde</a>\u00a0kindly agreed to provide sponsorship for his travel costs(approx. 50 Eur) from Paris to Brussels from the Antiheroes fund/the Support Fuckupreneurship tickets\u00a0(he is coming with his truck and bringing his equipment for the fire show).\u00a0\n\nHe's very rustic and does not use internet but will try to get him register on the platform :-)\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/628d0b2b5d5d08658dab9c3f4176ebb40a42e937.jpg\" width=\"368\" height=\"500\">\n\n", "created_at": "2016-02-05 14:40:57", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:16.077500", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 132, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24760, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 2014, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>our target audience: Loters and outer communities </b>\n\nWe are not trying to attract media attention in particular, but it would be a good side effect, in so far as press coverage can be a\u00a0side matter.

It's a tool to make visible the actual dependencies and leaderships in a decentralised organisation, and the [idea behind it is described in this white paper](https://edgeryders.eu/t/realities-project-white-paper/9064). To give some context, this tool is being developed with a certain organisation (The Borderland) in mind as to not make the concepts too abstract, but its features will not be specific to that organisation. From the mission statement summary in the white paper:\n\n> We will develop a software system that helps people in a decentralised organisation plan and execute co-created events without traditional top-down management. As to not make the use case too abstract, we will use the organisation The Borderland and its participants as our user group and develop explicitly for them, while not adding features that are only relevant to that organisation. Realities should give users the ability to create Needs and then Responsibilities and to assign a Guide and a Realiser to each Need and Responsibility. Needs and Responsibilities are connected by Dependencies which clarify how they are connected. Creating and assigning Needs and Responsibilities and connecting them with Dependencies should be simple and intuitive. The UI of the software should also transparently indicate the correlations of these elements to each other for a faster overview of the larger scope, for example by drawing graphs and connecting them to each other.\n\nDevelopment of Realities started in December of 2017, but halted after a few months as priorities shifted. We got quite close to an MVP stage though, so our first priority is to finish that work and get the codebase to a stage where Realities can be deployed and used. We also want the codebase to be well documented and structured so that it can be worked on collaboratively in an organised manner.\n\nIn light of this Erik Frisk, one of the developers who laid the ground work for Realities in 2017, has been allotted two weeks from the freelance developer budget to do the following:\n\n1. Refactor and document the code to prepare for collaborative development\n2. Implement removal of Needs and Responsibilities\n3. Adding Guides and Realizers\n4. Adding dependencies between elements\n\nWe think that two weeks of work should be enough, but will discuss extending it if necessary.\n\nErik, feel free to introduce yourself and post about major milestones. :slight_smile:", "created_at": "2018-09-05 14:37:11.980431", "updated_at": "2018-09-28 11:27:27.071714", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 407, "wiki": false, "reads": 28, "score": 100.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4660], "is_private": false}, {"id": 87904, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 14998, "post_number": 2, "raw": "I would like to bring up the editorial work of putting together the community journalism output....

Plants are not objects. \"Plant a tree\" sounds good, but are we planting trees in order to fight pollution? So we should pick those less affected by particulate. Let's say it's oaks (I'm inventing). Are oaks adaptable to every soil? Every climate? Are they predatory towards other species? Do we want to have a monoculture of pollution absorbing trees? What about biodiversity? How the fauna could react to this? How about the ecosystem? Which are the long term risks? And last but not least: is this ethical?\n\nMy point is: if we look at this from a closer perspective, we see how complex things are.

In the space we saw, the rooms are on the upper floow, and a large kitchen and a public co-working space are downstairs. The kitchen is large and friendly, as one would imagine it best serves a growing community. Notice boards and value boards are all around, as one would imagine they support group organising. The co-working space is open to others from the neighborhood who are able to buy affordable membership. We liked that it acts as a front shop for the community - it opens to the street, and you can almost just walk in! It is also a mixed use space, working by day and enjoying other activities in afternoon and evenings - yoga classes, open days, or other events. \nThis ensures a very nice mix between those living there and those wanting to hang out.\n\nWhat I liked the most is this focus on community first, in the midst of a growing market for co-housing this really can make the difference! No more residential hotels, thank you very much WeWork! \n\nWay to go Kai and team!\n\nIf you're in Berlin next time, make sure to drop by.

I always divide the city in 3 parts:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>The historic core, mostly pre-1952 and definitely pre-1970's (Downtown, some former suburbs that are pretty much downtown now) \u2192 It was planned, built to a stringent building code and evolved somewhat naturally since.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>The slums, which started appearing in the 1980's (Form a belt around the city, and surround the ring road, basically repurposed former farmland (!) ) \u2192 Basically illegal, completely unplanned and barely serviced by utilities.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>The desert satellite cities, mostly from the 1990's onward. (Government master plans to move people to the desert and protect farm land) \u2192\u00a0Built ~30 of km's away from the city center, mix between light dense walkup apartment buildings, public housing, and upscale compounds. Extreme urban sprawl</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nOut of these, 1. is from another era, 2. is unplanned and developed organically and 3. is government master plans.\u00a0\n\n3. The desert cities are a slowly unfolding disaster and are completely car-centric and dependant.\u00a0\n\n2. The slums are interesting in that they are the perfect embodiment of le Corbusier's building style: An efficient concrete skeleton and stairway, and everything else red bricks. They were built according to no building standards at all, and are thus very problem prone as well.\u00a0\n\nI find it is interesting how a western building style was appropriated locally and replicated so widely, most probably due to the its cheap costs.\u00a0\n\nComparing the unplanned (2, slums) and the planned (3, desert cities) from the modern era I can't quite conclude which is worse. The slums house communities and somehow work, but are universally detested and are highly problematic: Hygiene, safety, services etc. The desert cities overburden the utilities, are a drain on public money and are very fast experiencing extreme congestion as they are completely car reliant!

The rest of us, we can chip in as friendly fire to help one of the sides and put pressure on the other.

We want to approach activism broadly to include its various forms al the way to participation in protest actions. So, I propose the following coding scheme for \"activism.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s code three dimensions of activism.\n\n1.\t**Area or domain** (in which activism occurs). For example, housing, political parties, health care delivery, etc.\n2.\t**Form of activism**: institutional versus non-institutional. This a traditional distinction in the study of politics. A person can either engage in an institutional action via an existing institutional channel or via contentious action or protest activity.\n3.\t**Scale or scope**. I really want us to try to catch this. I propose four levels (2 and 3 can be merged to create a three-level scale):\n3.1.\tLocal\n3.2.\tRegional\n3.3.\tNational\n3.4.\tTransnational\n\nI also want to emphasize the importance of the political \u201cscale\u201d Wojtek has already introduced in this threat. So, we propose a seven-point scale:\n1.\tExtreme right\n2.\tRadical right\n3.\tCenter right (conservative)\n4.\tCenter-liberal\n5.\tCenter left (social-democratic)\n6.\tRadical left\n7.\tExtreme left\n\nWhy? The idea of dividing the right side of the scale into three \u201csectors\u201d is taken from Cas Mudde\u2019s recent book *The Far Right Today*. **He divides far right into radical and extreme**. I simply replicate this three-fold typology of the right in my analysis of the left. Extreme left are somehow similar to Soviet-style communists (or socialist). The radical left are socialist parties with programs are more radical than those of social democrats.\n\nNow, these distinctions, however useful analytically I believe them to be, may be way too fine for our work. In most cases people will simply talk about \u201cleft\u201d or \u201cright.\u201d So, I propose to code such self-identifications in vivo \u201cleft\u201d or \u201cright.\u201d So, what\u2019s the use of this seven-point scale?

Namely, I suggest a few rules for our Code Club:\n1. When **you want to create a new suggested hierarchy**, open a new tab (add a new sheet using the + symbol in the lower left corner of the page), name the category and place all the codes you think belong there by removing them (cutting them out, ctrl+x->ctrl+v) into the new sheet)\n2. **Close the blank spaces** left in the Every Single Code sheet by deleting blank rows\n3. **Write comments** when necessary and review other coders' suggested hierarchies at regular intervals\n4. The sheets for hierarchies will without doubt proliferate, but I've been told that each google sheet document can hold up to 200 sheets, so, considering that we will be focusing only on hierarchies that are relevant to the project (at least in the beginning) it should be no problem.\n5. **Removing the codes from the Every Single Code sheet** will help us keep track of how well we're doing, but may be a problem if somebody \"steals\" a code you wanted for your category in order to use it in theirs. If this happens, all disputes should be resolved peacefully, via comments in the documents or oral communication during our coding meetings, without resorting to any form of violence (review other prople's hierarchy sheets).\n6. **Any newly added codes should be introduced into the Every Single Code** sheet by means of placing them at the top of the list (I left a few blank rows, you can always add a few by right-clicking on the row number), which should facilitate placing them into appropriate hierarchies afterwards.\n7. **The sheet introduces Jan's idea for our project's grammar** using colour markers (flashy, I know, but I wanted them to be distinct, visible, and in most cases easy to find in the colour menu, apart from dark cyan 1 maybe for Institutions). It's a preliminary version of how it may be applied, so I'd welcome your input on how it works for you.\n8. **When you place your cursors over a given code, five links should appear**. They will take you to show/edit/annotations/merge/copy respectively. The most useful is show (the first link), but you can also try and visit other websites using this method.\n\nI will keep working on it (creating suggestions for hierarchies, commenting and colour-coding Jan's grammar).

I personally prefer sticking to noun forms, so instead of using, say, \"bother(ing)\" I'd just use \"bothering\". I'm also wondering about the use of adjectives and/or adverbs, as in \"bilingualism\" instead of \"bilingual\" or \"fascism\" instead of \"fascist\". It may be purely aesthetic, so just let me know what you think.\n2. What do you think about using names of people instead of names of countries? For example, coding \"Russians\" instead of \"Russia\"? Our project does not really focus on the beauty of landscapes or geographical aspects of given places (unless those geographical aspects somehow affect the social, political and other dimensions). I just believe that whatever \"Russia does\" is done by its people, and whatever happens to Russia happens to its people. What I'm suggesting is a distinction between a country, seen as an entity, piece of land on the map, and a country as a collective of individuals who self-identify as members thereof. It may turn out that, in the context of Poland, \"Ukraine\" and \"Ukrainians\" may not be salient enough to appear in the graph with the strength of co-occurences set to some higher values and yet BE salient enough to deserve a place on the graph.\nFor example, when people talk about migrating somewhere what they really mean is changing their geographical location, and thus we should use the name of a country. But when they talk about the atmosphere in that country, some political, economic or social processes that take place there, we should code for its people (since they pertain to its people and not the land). \n3. What do you say we change the definition of \"education\" to something like \"acquiring knowledge and learning new skills\"? I've just visited it and it has quite a few annotations mentioning education outside of schools? Maybe we should fork it and add \"formal education\" or \"schooling system\" or sth?\nBTW I co-code it with \"private sector\" when somebody mentions paid courses, etc.", "created_at": "2020-11-22 10:18:19.636132", "updated_at": "2020-11-22 10:51:19.716689", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 347, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 6.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 47809, "user_id": 4286, "topic_id": 9077, "post_number": 7, "raw": "Thank you for your reply @alberto ,In Egypt there are only two dominating cities (Cairo and Alexandria)\nwhere all events are centralized in them", "created_at": "2018-10-06 16:25:39.790576", "updated_at": "2018-10-06 16:25:39.790576", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 24, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 51.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [47800], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32059, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1688, "post_number": 46, "raw": "<b>Get the UK path cleared maybe?</b>\n\nDarren, would you be up for exploring the UK path and getting to a bullet point list of the requirements and context advantages?

Humans indeed have no physical specialization, but I'd argue that we have a very specialized brain, capable of symbolic and logical thought and communication.\n\nSo following your train of thought, humans would rely on their mind (their specialization) to survive in their environment. That has two parts. One is symbolic communication, which is again a social thing and connects to your idea of \"being social\" as the key to survival. But the other is symbolic thought and understanding, supporting survival with results like understanding the forces of nature, complex tools, observations about plant growth, agriculture, more useful plant varieties and so on.\n\nWith a bit of a stretch, these two large areas of applying the human mind map to extroverted and introverted people. \"Being social\" is not so much of a priority for introverted people, as they can be quite happy for some time trying to understand, tame and utilize inanimate things or non-human living things. Those who are introverted enough to be considered geeks or \"on the spectrum\" tend to have one \"passion activity\" on which they can focus all their attention and never get bored.

We don't have a code currently for \"public interest/the public/etc\" \n* `forming a coalition`: do we have a code for when groups/people come together as `strategies of pushing back` ? it's not quite the same thing as `connecting people`\n* Having read through the report, I think it's important to keep track of human vs. machine abilities.

I think this is a great opportunity to me, to live here, in MAtera, because I can share my experience with the locals, to inspire one another and to give them an alternative living model. That's the reason beacuse I have been thinking about opening my house and create a co-living (inviting people from outside the region in order to maximise the sharing) and at the same time create a collaborative space where I can share the space, time, experience and tools with others, minimizing the financial part (we share expenses) and maximising the value and the oppurtunities that together we can build up.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-26 15:17:13", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 13:12:50.710758", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 259, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 25.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 47435, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 9046, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2018-09-18 11:40:47.429740", "updated_at": "2018-09-19 07:29:36.050453", "deleted_at": "2018-10-01 19:22:38.831397", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 2915, 3904, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 47461, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 9049, "post_number": 1, "raw": "@hugi and @alex_levene and @noemi, I got this random invitation:\n\nhttp://www.intercult.se/en/ars-baltica-creative-dialouge-8-10/?utm_source=Intercult+Sverige&utm_campaign=77050c9290-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_09_19_09_07&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_f3d928eb85-77050c9290-152163073   \n\nI am not sure it is anything to write home about, but makes me think that Edgeryders's presence in Stockholm might be a boon for those of us looking into culture.

Law states principles that are supposedly good according to some criterion, for example \"every human being has a right to life\". Econ is then tasked to \"foot the bill\": organizing production, distribution and consumption of resources so that those principles can be honored. \n\nThe great appeal of SF is imagining societies that operate on principles different from those we see in real life, sometimes wildly so. Econ-SF is about looking for a tight coupling between those imagined societies and the imagined economies that sustain them. In this sense, for me _Autonomous_ falls partly short. Patent economics is solid, but we [don't need to get that from SF](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/06/eus-copyright-proposal-extremely-bad-news-everyone-even-especially-wikipedia) as it is already here, and pretty evenly distributed, too. Labor economics is interesting, but a bit cloudy. All these bots that seem to be very expensive, ultra-specialized workers... and humans being indentured to do cheap labor... this makes me think there must be a cadre of high value human workers (\"botadmins\" like Lee, for example). I also struggle to imagine how production works. And consumption:  who buys all these expensive meds? Is there a large, prosperous, middle class? You never see it in _Autonomous_, unless it's researchers (and they are mostly grad students anyway).\n\nSo, reclaiming value etc. is a great idea, but what kind of _actual_ organization of our economy would support that?", "created_at": "2018-09-25 13:28:57.862642", "updated_at": "2018-09-25 13:28:57.862642", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 296, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 32.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [47554], "is_reply_to": [47554], "is_liked_by": [4497], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10467, "user_id": 1680, "topic_id": 5436, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Yeah</b>\n\nI'm more worried about people hacking into my computer.

At any rate, we have clear points of difference from this historical work, and we can articulate them. Our task is to continue to read and see if this bears out, and if we need to make our poinnt of difference/main project more clear. (or call it something else, like 'conceptual' network analysis). Other papers are more closely related to SSNA, it seems, so we read on with these thoughts in mind. \n\nWe need to do the work of reading the literature and 1) talking about its relationship to our work and 2) organising them to give a review of prior literature (@alberto points out). So while we continue to move through the readings, let's be sure to write what the relationship of that reading is to our work (what are our points of difference, departure, etc) and perhaps try to categorise it relative to other literature we have read so far.

So we have to take the participant's word for it, and as we know in anthropology, people do not always do what they say or say what they do :) \n\nSimilarly, their use of the 'online' is different (as in, conversations aren't convened online to discuss actual-world issues --- the topic of analysis is the online world itself, a gaming space. So while the paper discusses both social networks and digital ethnography, both are used in different ways from our usage. Interesting paper though! Allows them to talk about how gamers might construct social networks that support their gaming, leading them to over-play. The causal direction though was up for grabs (whether gamers who played a lot surrounded themselves with people positive about gaming, or whether being surrounded by people who were positive about gaming lead to more playing).", "created_at": "2018-10-23 10:35:07.458158", "updated_at": "2018-10-23 10:35:29.073872", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 300, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 61.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [48032], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5469, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 5436, "post_number": 1, "raw": "https://securitybrief.com.au/story/information-security-professionals-may-not-be-prepared-iot-after-all/\n\nAs you might expect, the IoT is fraught with security holes and a growing population of users who are rather unconcerned about it - mainly because they don't know and don't think about it enough. \u00a0But do you want someone hacking into your Google Car? \u00a0This article points out that many IoT devices and projects don't even know all that connect to them.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-03-17 14:19:47", "updated_at": "2018-05-26 08:41:26.801861", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 86, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 48037, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 9061, "post_number": 36, "raw": "T. Van Holt, Johnson, J. C., Carley, K. M., Brinkley, J., & Diesner, J. (2013). Rapid ethnographic assessment for cultural mapping. Poetics, 41(4), 366-383.\n\nThis piece is about coding scaling/automation and coding accuracy. The authors try to find a way to analyze large swaths of online textual information, recommending semi-automated coding (balanced recall and precision) which they say is preferable to both fully automated coding, which is usually inaccurate (high recall, low precision) and human coders, who are slow (and have low recall, high precision). \n\nThis article is definitely worth @alberto @melancon and @markomanka reading as well. \n\nIt focuses on ethnographic coding, which has the goal of maximizing the 'contextual properties of the original texts'. Their goal is a 'rapid analysis of a culture, the socio-economic and environmental drivers of  culture, and how these processes change over time'. They compare 3 coding strategies which are outlined in more detail (fully automated, semiautomated, and human). the semi automated employs a 'human in the loop' approach (what they call a data-to-model process, or D2M). The coder reviews a list of automated strategies and can change them, resulting in a list of concepts and their frequency. Then those concepts are categorized into ontological categories using a machine learning technique. The categories are again vetted by a human. Then links between categories are made -- automated, using a proximity-based approach where user specifies a window size within which all concepts are linked to each other. This results in a network representation of textual information -- each concept is associated with an ontological category, with concept networks containing weighted, bi-directional links. Then it is visualised using software. \n\nIn short- -- interesting, everyone should read, and we will almost definitely need to cite.

Studying crowdfunding and charity there are some rules that help: people like \"successful\" initiative (the achievement of a specific goal that adress a specific need), to produce a somehow quantifiable contribution (for this reason the pledge should be done directly by the users) and to have some choices (this reinforce engagement part).\n\nI think also this model would help us to involve smaller organizations that could be more willing to support the promotion activity for fairbnb.\n\nFor the support of Fairbnb outside big cities, I think two are the consideration needed:\n\nThe first is that Fairbnb should help valorize places that are underrated.\n\nFor example, I'm from Italy (from Rome) and in my opinion, there are so many little places that are worth visiting, is really upsetting knowing that just a few cities here have the attention of international travelers.\u00a0\n\nFor example, I rarely suggest to go in Rome (especially if you are young), go to Sicily if you can :)!!\n\nMore in general the money generated through the Fairbnb system are split 60% goes around the area where you traveled (it can be the entire region) and the other 40% can be given to any project inside the platform.

We were there in the heroic phase of the unMonastery: the power of art when it got in sync with these broader social and economic dynamics was staring at us in the face. Nadia's argument to the art world was more or less this: \n\n> Art is relevant when it allies itself with some societal forces. These forces can be for conservation or for progress or change. You can make fantastic art in both directions, by the way: Michelangelo and Bach both chose conservation, as they put themselves in the service of the powers that be, and helped celebrate their might and leadership. Other great artists chose change, like the Italian futurists or Beethoven, choosing to engage with Napoleon (then sweeping Europe on the wave of revolutionary ideas) with the Heroic Symphony. Change is happening _right now_, at the edges of society. _Where are you guys?_\n\nI guess our idea at the time was that artists should be in the unMonastery with us. Or doing science, or technology, or finance. Perhaps funded by research grants, or hedge funds, instead of art institutions. We might even be able to help a bit! They should be working with the movers and shakers, some of which will be rebels. I am not sure if this even makes sense \u2013 it appeals to me, but what do I know? To the extent that it does, it explains my lack of enthusiasm for rural dynamics. But that is personal, and totally irrelevant to ER's trajectory.

Again, very sorry we did not meet in Edinburgh when you were not here. Just to let you know that I was one of the founders of IETM and know well many of the 'old stagers' who were in wales (including Henk Keizer, whom I have worked with on several projects). I also am very familiar with the work of Heba El Cheikh and Mahatat based on Cairo. She is really a 'star' who is working under very difficult circumstances. Most of the tools she has used are available on the Mahatat website.

I'm not really sure if EdgeRyders are 'ahead of the curve, but I would be interested to hear who you have identified on the platform that is engaged with current themes.

The various ways in which these phenomena impact Europe also need closer scrutiny.\n - Proposals should produce country and regional analyses of the interplay between religion, politics and identity... Proposals should involve relevant actors (e.g. policymakers, religious leaders, representatives of civil society) to ensure mutual learning and take-up of results.\n - Expected Impact: The action will improve the knowledge base on violent extremism in the broader MENA region and the Balkans. It will ensure a step-up in mutual learning between the EU and third countries in light of common challenges.\n\n- [**Social and economic effects of migration in Europe and integration policies**](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/topics/migration-03-2019.html)\n - RIA, 3million (9million total), due 14 March 2019\n - A greater understanding of the social and economic effects and impacts of migration in Europe is needed in order to obtain an objective overview of developments and to address misperceptions.\n - Interdisciplinary research with combined insights from disciplines such as sociology, economics, history, anthropology, cultural studies and psychology among others is needed.\n - Furthermore, proposals should analyse the local and interactional dimension of integration processes and their effects on the provision of local services, workplace conditions, productivity and innovation. They should comparatively examine integration policies (labour market, education, health, civil rights, social welfare, housing, family policies, etc.), and the role of transnational institutions and networks in shaping integration at a local scale.\n\n- **[Innovative solutions for inclusive and sustainable urban environments](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/topics/transformations-03-2018-2019.html)**\n - RIA, 3million (6million total), due 14 March 2019\n - We considered the CSA last round and I have some contacts for potential coordinators.\n - The challenge is to identify the main drivers of inequalities in different urban and peri-urban contexts and to identify best practices and initiatives, including digital solutions and alternative participatory growth models, with potential for upscaling that can promote upward social mobility, social inclusion and cohesion, resilience and sustainable development.\n - Proposals should assess the scale, dimensions and drivers of socio-economic inequalities in urban and peri-urban settings across different city typologies, across Europe and across demographic diversities, paying particular attention to gender differences.\n - Expected Impact: By linking research, innovation and policy, the action will support urban strategies, policies and planning practices to promote equitable, inclusive and sustainable growth, including the uptake of new, participatory and alternative growth models.'\n\n- (Wild card...) **[Enhancing social rights and EU citizenship](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/topics/governance-04-2019.html)**\n - RIA, 3million (9million total), due 14 March 2019\n\n- **[Digitisation, Digital Single Market and European culture: new challenges for creativity, intellectual property rights and copyright](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/topics/dt-governance-13-2019.html)**\n - We are already in discussion about this\n\n_(Note to self to look into the Other Actions in the WP)_\n\n## SwafS work programme\n\n- **[Open schooling and collaboration on science education](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/topics/swafs-01-2018-2019.html)**\n - RIA, 1.5million (4.5million total), 2 stage call - first deadline 2 April 2019\n - We already have one potential partner who are leading a RIA in the WP interested in this call with us, and @winnieponcelet has also flagged interest \n - This is a good time to expand opportunities for science learning, in formal, non-formal and informal settings... Therefore, collaboration between formal, non-formal and informal science education providers, enterprises and civil society should be enhanced to ensure relevant and meaningful engagement of all societal actors with science and increase the uptake of science studies, citizen science initiatives and science-based careers, employability and competitiveness.\n - The proposed action targets the creation of new partnerships in local communities to foster improved science education for all citizens. This action aims to support a range of activities based on collaboration between formal, non-formal and informal science education providers, enterprises and civil society in order to integrate the concept of open schooling, including all educational levels, in science education.\n - Expected Impact: It is expected that in the short term the development of partnerships between schools, local communities, Civil Society Organisations, universities and industry should contribute to a more scientifically interested and literate society and students with a better awareness of and interest in scientific careers. \n\n- **[Exploring and supporting citizen science](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/topics/swafs-15-2018-2019.html)**\n - Consider another go at this call for 2019\n - RIA, 2million (10million total), due 2 April 2019", "created_at": "2018-09-26 21:18:03.217364", "updated_at": "2018-09-26 21:19:15.815334", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 934, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 79.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 47613, "user_id": 3904, "topic_id": 9068, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Oh and as per existing discussions, there may be movements around :\n\n[Innovative and citizen-driven food system approaches in cities](https://edgeryders.eu/t/food-for-thought-innovative-and-citizen-driven-food-system-approaches-in-cities/8843)\n\nand\n\n[Collaborative approaches to cultural heritage for social cohesion](https://edgeryders.eu/t/well-i-just-got-excited-collaborative-approaches-to-cultural-heritage-for-social-cohesion/8852)", "created_at": "2018-09-26 21:29:43.186930", "updated_at": "2018-09-26 21:29:43.186930", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 64, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 8.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 47753, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 9066, "post_number": 6, "raw": "Hi @bob, agree with you on the cities front.

Since Hugi is now involved in setting up an Edgeryders presence in a community event / art workshop venue in Stockholm, we'd like to do it first there and see how it goes, but also see if other cities or partners are interested in this format of online building of essentially a community art show with an activist flavor and real discussions.\n\nIf we approach the work as creators with full execution mandate, it might be better not just for us, but also for these cities.. they have their consultants already.\n\nSo beyond this, Bob, do you think IETM is a good fit for Edgeryders new collaborations? I would really like your opinion. It seems like their events programs are built way before members register and there is little space in the format to host new conversations.. Would you recommend another approach, more generative for us?\n\nI think a call is due with everyone interested in this kind of work.

This cooling is used for providing cool shades for poultry house. The water from high head is taken in pipe from river and sprayed on top of house from spring jets. As there is enough head for water pressure to run sprinkles there is no use of any other source of energy. The water continuously cools the upper roof sliding and cooling lower roof. Thus innovation can start at home with use of simple logic, locally available resource and less investment.\n\nMethodology:\n\nThis kind of system does not require any external energy for operation. The water head difference and kinetic energy of water is able to drive sprinkles. The regulated flow of water will rotate sprinkles which helps to cool upper roof successively sliding down via steel roof to lower roof.

In short, this is getting hairy. \n\nBefore I start going down the path of ripping the tulip library apart, I will probably want to try installing the API on another machine, like a VPN running Ubuntu or something similarly standard. Perhaps there is some incompatibility between recent MacOS releases and some dependencies of the tulip library.\n\nAnother possibility is that there is some other branch of the code that is actually running for the OpenCare data, which would also explain why the documentation and example conf file was so out date.

Their tagline 'integenerational coaching' sums it up well: older people passing on their skills to young people with a migrant background. Is that something you envision as well? It might be insightful to talk to them as well.\n\nIn my home town we have a related story going on. The old movie theater \u00a0in the city centre, a beautiful building with a rich history and emotional meaning for\u00a0a lot of people, was bought by project developers after bankruptcy. They plan to install service flats where elderly that are still okay can live in co-housing with people who need care, like other elderly or young people with a disability. Yet the whole project has a very commercial smell hanging around it. Do you meet similar stories, is there an impact on the sector?\n\n", "created_at": "2016-10-11 20:37:38", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:13.076135", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false,

organization like this one before, I haven\u2019t seen anything like it when I was a kid in Qus. It started with a discussion on a local cafe ( \u2018Ahwa) between some young people including myself and other relatively older men; At that time we didn\u2019t have a clear vision on where are we going to make our activities and these stuff were not easily done during 2010 for security reasons but being in a small town like Qus where almost everyone knows everyone we started with a facebook page; After that we get in contact with the head of the local Governmental  Cultural space ( called culture palaces in Egypt) , He liked the idea and we started with a cultural salon as a first activity for \u201cQus Baladna\u201d ( translated to Qus our country )  initiative.  The cooperation with the space with beneficial for both parties, we got to have a space to do some of our activities and this in turn made the space more alive with more visitors and brought new people in. \n\nWe started with some basic activities like gatherings for poetry or singing or science clubs, then make a small theatrical play for cheap tickets (2-3 pounds ) and via these activities we started to be known for the wider local community in Qus.   \n\nIt was quite a small initiative in the beginning build by young people without any experience but it was welcomed by the local community and the older people and the intellectuals in town looked at it as valuable thing that is creating a new character in town eliminating the differences between families and classes and getting away form the revenge culture ( tar - a culture of customary provisions ) , as everyone was welcomed to join. Girls joined as well the initiative which was one of our biggest challenges at that time. \n\n\n\n\nThen Comes the Revolution 2011\n\nWe started to increase our activities and we had political awareness campaigns, health awareness campaigns, and Science classes ( simplified ) in the nearby villages. We started to cooperate with community based organizations in the nearby villages as well. \n\nDuring this time, our group started to grow as well, lots of university and high school students joined us and we started to have a bigger and better structure. We gained the trust of the people by refusing to be affiliated with any political party or family, we were being known and respected to be independent and till now after 8 years people the initiative still works and people join our different activities.\n\n\nWe organized ourselves, so each activity had one or more coordinators, and we make yearly internal elections to decide who will be the the general coordinator and he is always the person who is available with relatively more experience.\n\nWe started some educational activities; we had an English language and French language club for primary and secondary school students, to have an alternative way of education instead of the traditional education that we had in schools which is not effective ( as in my generations case ), after this we started a project ( Geel Lebokra - a generation for tomorrow ) for school students to train them to overcome challenges in learning or in other words learning how to learn, this was done in 2 schools; Omar Ibn Elkhattab school in Elhomr village and Elneel primary school in Qus.  With these activities we hope that some of the younger generation get to have better education than the one that we had. \n\n\n\nQus Cinema club started 3 years ago and I was the main coordinator\n\nFor the past 10 or 13 years we didn\u2019t have a cinema in Qus, since the demolition of Abdelwahab Cinema, so there was a need for a new cinema. Till now we screened 44 movies in Qus Cinema club, in the beginning we faced some opposition/ problems with some strict conservatives and we used to go in long discussions and arguments after the shows but afterwards they lost interest and the cinema continued regularly, and Currently it is run by a group of young women ( university students) I still help and support when needed but they are the main organizers now. The fact that now the cinema is run by young women is a result of 8 years of continues work of Qus Baladna. \n\nAnother activity is the kids club where we provide recycling workshops for kids ( and elderly as well) the ones in charge are young women as well who study industrial studies. The products are shipped to the city of Nagada which is known for handicrafts  to be displayed in fairs and some products are sold this way. \n\n\n\nWe worked on 17 different activity in general in  cultural, social, and economical spheres. \n\nDuring the past 8 years, a lot of people joined the initiative and a lot left as well, almost all of the founders and main initiators left Qus for work whether in Cairo or Gulf countries, as there are not enough job opportunities in here, for example I graduated from Faculty of mass communication with very good grades and was the first students in my year but unfortunately I can\u2019t find a good work opportunity in Qus, but the initiative itself is continuing and each generation passes the responsibility to the next one. \nDuring Ramadan we started a small campaign called ( coupon campaign) , which in turn was the seed for a new project called Nabta, where a number of families in need get to have a coupon and they can buy their needs from a nearby supermarket instead of giving bags with pre-ordered stuff that they might not need. \n\n\nFinance\n\n\nThe initiative is self-financed, we have a monthly pay/subscription for 5-6 years now where each member pays monthly, and this makes us independent but also limit us a bit and we can\u2019t create all what we dream.\n\nOf course we reduce our purchases as much as possible and we work within our financial limit, for example the cinema started with a laptop of a friend, and the space was provided by a local organization and we only got to buy a projector. \n\nThe only project that we accept donation for is Nabta, which supports the families in need with seed funding for small projects; Most of the families are from the nearby villages, we go there and research each case and get to know them and then decide which project fits their situation in participation with them.\nWe funded around 39 projects in 8 different villages, the average cost of one project is around 2500-3000 Egyptian pound, we follow up with them regularly and try to provide support and help in marketing, we are in a small town and this helps a lot in marketing as we know the people. \n\nOne of the projects is manufacturing ropes from palm leafs ( or midribs ) thes is made manually and sold in the Monday and Tuesday markets in a nearby village which is considered a commercial hub. \n \nBreeding pigeons and ducks is another well adopted project, most of the projects are made in houses or in areas around the houses, so depends on the space and people, usually most beneficiaries are widows from the villages. \n\nThe only special project that costed more was a furniture workshop, the beneficiary had a space in his house and the whole project costed 11000 LE and half of the money will be paid back to support other families.\n\nAll the projects in Nabta are made in cooperation with community based organizations in the villages themselves and by time we gained mutual trust and we work smoothly together. \n\n\n\nDealing with cultural institutions in Cario\n\nCurrently I am living in between Cairo and Qus,  I have visited a lot of cinema clubs and cultural hubs in Cairo, but till now a lot of  people from cairo, even the ones in cultural institutions don\u2019t believe the idea of having a cultural live in other regions of Egypt not to mention a cinema in Qus in upper Egypt. \n\nI am not really enjoying living in Cairo, it is quite different than the community of little town, the people are different, it\u2019s noisy, always busy, but most of us come here for work. \n\nI face a lot of difficulty in convincing people that such a cultural initiative is happening in a small town called Qus, I always get ignored or  non-interest in cooperating and supporting us in Qus. \n\nWIth small exceptions like zawya, we cooperated with them in screening a movie from the European film Panorama in Qus last year and other films as well and will screen a new one from the European films this year as well. But in general people are lazy to come and give lectures/ talks/  workshops because of the long travel time or lack of funding or lack of interest. \n\nWhat could help the initiative at the moment is to support the current team with trainings and workshops in cultural and  societal work, this is something that we are missing in Qus. Some of our members get accepted in some trainings or workshops in Cairo every ones and while but most of the team are amateurs with lots of energy and are eager to learn and get more experience in the field. \n\nFinally Qus baladna is still working and continuing with a new generation getting the steering wheel from the older one while building the basis for new leaders. \n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/8/8f17866049aaff8b844f975078a313288cc3db8f.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"690\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/d/db823a24f198156dc7351a7cc61e69c9dc19fb65.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"690\">", "created_at": "2018-10-01 15:16:55.397367", "updated_at": "2018-10-01 15:19:18.828103", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2791, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 177.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4085, 3782], "is_private": false}, {"id": 56433, "user_id": 4861, "topic_id": 9076, "post_number": 62, "raw": "[quote=\"alberto, post:61, topic:9076\"]\nI owe you one.\n[/quote]\n\nI will try to remember :slight_smile: (next year at GEN Conference or Fusion Festival...)\n\nAlso, feel free to reach out for me in case of need for consulting, moderation/facilitation, debugging help or anything hardcore-IT.", "created_at": "2019-07-09 17:49:13.038048", "updated_at": "2019-07-09 17:49:13.038048", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 47, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 55.8, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [56297], "is_reply_to": [56297], "is_liked_by": [5, 4022, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 56467, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 9076, "post_number": 63, "raw": "[quote=\"felix.wolfsteller, post:62, topic:9076\"]\nAlso, feel free to reach out for me in case of need for consulting, moderation/facilitation, debugging help or anything hardcore-IT.\n[/quote]\n\n\nNoted!

I have studied the science of complexity since it turned physicists \nblue a few decades ago, and I feel that it needs to be understood as it \napplies to human interactions and our impacts on Earth and all its life \nforms. The necessity to deal with the unpredictable nature of complex \nsystems is critical in designing patterns of governance. Also of prime \nimportance is recognizing that complex systems at all levels can only be \ncontrolled or changed by dealing with the basic rules that govern \ninteractions of the players, not by focusing on the system\u2019s symptoms, \ni.e. the observed problems generated by those interactions. Too often \nour habit is to address fixing only the symptoms, when the basic rules \nthat govern a complex system need to be discovered and changed.\n\n>* How should the experiments in governance deal with current disasters \nand the fact that they are likely to continue as a result of global \nwarming, overuse of resources, and human overpopulation? Can Europe \nprovide models of how population levels can be held in check?\n\n>* How should governance address the current extremes in religious belief \nand issues such as abortion, where morality is at stake: one side \nbelieving sacred human life begins at fertilization and others believing \nit is evil to bring any unwanted child into a life of such suffering. \nThe current divide in this country is mind-boggling.\n\n>* Is all governance simply regulation? How else can we identify and \nprotect the commons from deterioration and overuse--the commons being \nclean air and water, healthy land and oceans, sources of food, \ntransportation and places to live? Somehow the commons distribution \nneeds to be balanced fairly.\n\n>* How do we deal with politics that refuses to consider options beyond \ntheir single focus on \u201cno regulation\u201d on business (as in the U.S.now) or \non winning \u201cuber alles\u201d in spite of rational evidence? Is Earth on a \npath like Easter Island, where ten communities competed for resources \nuntil they were all used up. The four-way stop intersection near our \nhome is a great example of simple governance by taking turns--first one \ncar goes first or the one on the right goes first. Humans can do such \nreasonable regulation.\n\n>At your Istanbul meeting or elsewhere, feel free to use any of these \nideas or any of the material (including basic complexity information) on \nmy website http://caryneeper.com and the other sites listed under my \nemail signature. My books\u2019 information is on http://archivesofvarok.com. \nI would also recommend looking at Herman Daly\u2019s website \nhttp://steadystate.org. They are putting out essays detailing that \neconomic theory, which has developed over all these years since I was \ninspired to write a fictional portrayal of what the steady state \ninvolves--The Archives of Varok. The fourth book on overpopulation \n(coming out in 2019) is the series\u2019 historical novel. The books are not \nreal science fiction--the \u201cellls and varoks\u201d are my Oz characters, handy \nfor bouncing off ideas of human identity and steady state economics. I \nam a science realist--writing for astronaut.com on how large the \nuniverse is \u201cso we had better take care of planet Earth.\u201d We\u2019re not \ngoing anywhere, so we need to face up to the carbon challenge and \nprepare for the big hits already coming. We saw it coming in the 1980\u2019s, \nbut determined to try and be positive. My husband\u2019s latest blogs (parts \n1-7) might also be of interest. \nhttp://neeper.net/american-angst-part-4-of-7-fascism/  \n>In my blog on  Goodreads https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1263662.Cary_Neeper/blog \nI have been doing short book reviews of nonfiction that deals with \ntoday\u2019s economic wierdness here in the U.S. and other books worth \nreading for those concerned about the future. Please let me know if I \ncan be of help in any other way-- and sincere thanks for the invitation. \nI\u2019ll be tracking your web sites.\n\n>Below I am providing the steady state laundry list from the Nautilus \naward winner The Webs of Varok. It can stand in for my presence in \nIstanbul if you like.\n\n> From The Webs of Varok: Appendix A. Conn\u2019s Recommendations For Earth\n\n> 1. The most efficient thing to do is to cap energy use--lots of luck. Be \nsure to cap off specific resources, based on known reserves. Be sure the \nuse of non-renewables does not exceed their waste. The no-brainer is to \nbe sure renewables are one-hundred percent regenerated before you use \nthem up.\n> 2. Population numbers should be stabilized--all of them, region by \nregion. Everyone gets to replace themselves. Of course, they can buy up \nsomeone else\u2019s replacement certificate, or sell theirs. Use incentives \nto encourage replacement only. No nasty coercion allowed. Education, \nwomen\u2019s rights, and birth control help--a lot.\n\n>\n* Inequality leads to revolution, which usually doesn\u2019t work unless \nsomeone has a real plan--like letting workers determine wages and salary \ndifferentials. No more than fifteen percent difference in income; that\u2019s \nenough for needed incentive. Employee business ownership and co-ops \nhelp. Everyone, that\u2019s every sentient being, gets a Citizen Income, an \nautomatic unconditional payment from the government, funded by \ninheritance and luxury taxes or something more inventive.\n\n> * For goodness sake, stabilize the money supply. Encourage localization \nwith local currencies. Print just enough to run the global government, \nwhich should be busy counting resources and not much else. Banks can \nmediate loans but must keep one hundred percent reserves, I.e., loan \nonly what others have saved. Loans should require collateral--remember \nthat word? Banks could also stash jewels in rented safe deposit boxes, \nbut do little else.\n\n> * Forget the gross domestic product (GDP). Try Bhutan\u2019s GPH or the \nGPI+--something that measures well-being. Just don\u2019t count the cost of \ncleaning up someone\u2019s nasty pollution as great economics. Separate the \nends like well-being from the means.\n\n> * To insure meaningful and full employment, shorten work times to \ndistribute jobs where needed and increase leisure and creative time. The \ngovernment, like the city council, might do some job guaranteeing in the \nfields of education and medicine, or fixing bridges, but no subsidies \non polluters, please.\n\n> * Set prices, business revenue, to include all capital costs, \nenvironmental and disposal or recycling costs. Think social benefit, not \nprofit. Tax away excess profits, income and harmful practices, like \nintrusive advertising (junk mail).\n\n> * Localize. Localize. Localize all goods and services. Raise tariffs if \nnecessary to protect local business. Free trade is just another example \nof \u201cWinner Take All,\u201d so keep money and labor at home. Institute a Tobin \nTax on exchange of currencies. Hire locals. Finance local businesses \nlocally. Quit shipping tasteless apples all over the world, and eat more \nlocal kumquats. Share appliances. Cluster ventures that need a large \ninfrastructure.\n\n>*  Revise lifestyle ethics to emphasise \u201cenough is enough,\u201d cliche though \nit is. You don\u2019t need a new one, a prettier one, a shorter one, an \nuglier cool one. Share appliances. Fix what\u2019s broke and require \nmanufacturers to take responsibility for their products, all the way to \nthe junk or recycle heap--like some Europeans do. Spare parts businesses \nwill boom. And no producing gewgaws for gewgaws\u2019 sake. Encourage art and \ngames instead.\n\n>* Print this on your forehead: the economy is a sub-system of the \nenvironment. It\u2019s not the other way around. The human population is \nalready too big for Earth to absorb its wastes, much less produce new \ndell phones for everyone. Everyone needs clean water to drink. Now! \nInvent more new ways to explore how to stabilize, not grow, the economy. \n                                Love and good luck, Conn*\n*Conn\u2019s recommendations are based in part on the economic theories of \nHerman Daly and CASSE (Center for the Advancement of the Steady State \nEconomy).", "created_at": "2018-10-09 12:34:26.624603", "updated_at": "2018-10-09 14:04:06.288507", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1593, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 27.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 47826, "user_id": 3686, "topic_id": 9086, "post_number": 1, "raw": "hello,\n\nSo the Forestry commission in Scotland is looking for alterative to pesticides to control the pine weevils that are eat newly planted conifers. \n\ncurrently Monsanto's gazelle is used. it is a neonicotinoid that is a key factor in Colony collapse disorder for [bees.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_collapse_disorder)\n\nI work for the forestry workers co-op. we are campaigning against The use of pesticides in forestry.

Everyone wants \"interdisciplinary\" and \"embedded in a real community\" in theory, but is CAPSSI prepared to fund a project that de-prioritizes software development in favor of prototyping (not of software, but of <em>practical solutions</em>) and of new methods of enquiry on collective awareness that <em>reuse</em> existing software? And the answer is unambiguously YES.\n\nSo. We do our care thing. We focus on building exciting prototype solutions and summoning a vibrant community around them. We run ethno analysis. We use the ethno coding to do a semantic social network analysis, which Ben, Guy and I have a hunch is the way to go for online conversation harvesting. This will definitely require sticking together some simple-to-use tool (think <a href=\"http://edgeryders.edgesense.spazidigitali.com\">Edgesense</a>, but with semantics), but this will reuse existing libraries and not aim to build commercial grade, sleek, deeply integrated software.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-02-19 07:42:52", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:16.726194", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 178, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 51229, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 9091, "post_number": 21, "raw": "Facebook continues to try to police the world's speech...\n\nhttps://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/men-are-scum-inside-facebook-war-on-hate-speech?fbclid=IwAR2rvNX63FVY7tx5g-Vy2wTHtyqqujOSzi-ZbXmA-LAbygauorw1vZD_9KY", "created_at": "2019-03-01 05:39:03.636181", "updated_at": "2019-03-01 05:39:03.636181", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 31, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 20.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2095], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17407, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 3027, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Its a matter of health and stress management</b>\n\nI read the email sent and read it as a distress call.\n\nThe dynamics inside the building as they seem to envelope everyone and create an unhealthy cycle that just has to stop now.

The project's website is www.extinctbirdsproject.com. I focused most of my attention on these 17 species but there are over 130 other birds that have gone extinct in the past few centuries. The project investigates cultural, economic and natural influences that have affected the extinct species and continue to affect other endangered ones. By presenting this information in an accessible and interesting manner, those see the exhibition or view the book and website, can be better informed in making important decisions in the future. The project investigated extinctions in New Zealand, India, Australia, Madagascar, Brazil, United States, and Mexico. Our hope is to investigate extinct species in other countries so that a more global perspective is included. I would be interested in working with communities in these countries and working together and making this information accessible.\n\nProject 2\nWe are working with educators and community leaders in western New York as well as parts of the northeastern part of the United States to provide education to students on issues that negatively affect their environment. By introducing children to flyfishing, the sport becomes provides experiential experiences outside and an interesting element in the curriculum that gets children outside to engage with their environment while investigating how economics, physics, biology, literature and art are connected to flyfishing, The sport is the thread the links all of these disciplines together. The three-day workshop for the educators and community members introduces how each participant can integrate this new information and perspective into their classes and how to start new programs in their region if they are so inclined. The workshops also allow for lively discussion as everyone gets to also share their expertise and perspectives. The program has been very successful to date with new programs and new direction occurring throughout the region. For more information, please go to www.childreninthestream.com. We are looking to expand the program beyond our region and are looking for support to make this happen in other communities around the world.\n\nThank you and let me know what you think.\n\n\n\n\n\nKind regards,\nAlberto", "created_at": "2018-10-14 23:58:51.063623", "updated_at": "2018-12-03 20:23:55.762620", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 422, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 157.0, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 2915, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 49145, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 9101, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Hi @albertorey, it's interesting to see you back after exactly one year..\n\nSo work is going well!\nDo you see any possibility to work with Edgeryders or use online conversations as add ons to your projects?", "created_at": "2018-12-03 16:48:49.905111", "updated_at": "2018-12-03 16:48:49.905111", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 37, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 11.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 47941, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 9102, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Hello @julyandavey, welcome.

People who are very busy on the ground building their stuff tend to have little time for engaging with aggregators and hubs, _unless_ there is something very concrete in it for them. Trust me, we know. We have been trying to get people to communicate about their projects, so that we can all be within line of sight of each other. But it's hard: doers agree this would be a cool thing to have, but it's just not worth engaging with, as the activity of blogging, debating, engaging etc. competes with many more activities that they give a higher priority to.\n\nIn Edgeryders, all projects are participatory. And in every single one of them we need to address what we call \"the what's-in-it-for-me question\". Not because people are not altruistic: they are! But because being altruistic is hard work, it can get very demanding and risks burning out on people. So, any aggregation initiative we try is aware of the costs of aggregation to the doers on the ground, and we always give back as much as we can (normally by hiring people for meaningful, paid gigs or involving their organizations as partners in paid gigs).", "created_at": "2018-10-16 10:50:45.698956", "updated_at": "2018-10-16 10:50:59.365112", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 236, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 27.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3067], "is_private": false}, {"id": 47969, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 9102, "post_number": 4, "raw": "[quote=\"julyandavey, post:3, topic:9102\"]\nDo you see a need for a hub which feeds people from the profit-motive economy into the social economy?

All in all, we think we could use them as consultants, especially in the phase where we go from seeing a building to having a complete breakdown of legal options and spreadsheets with projected costs and revenues. Here are my notes from the meeting. \n\nIn Belgium the real estate market is divided into two. Private market, as always. But then there are real estate developers, who buy, develop and sell at a markup. In other countries (but not in Belgium) there is a third way: take development back to the people. This third way is where Miss Miyagi positions itself.\n\nThey are based in the old Stella Artois brewery in Leuven. Production stopped in the 1980s. After ofer 20 years, 7 people in Leuven had a company and needed a space. They were directed to the company who owned this building. It had been empty for 25 years, because no developer could figure out a sustainable business model to develop it. \n\nThey ended up buying the building on the cheap. Next, they asked a resourceful architect to develop the building on their needs. He then proposed to involve other people with businesses that needed space. The idea was to get rid of the figure of the traditional real estate developer, who focuses on building, pockets 15-30% (more 30% in Brussels) and disappears. \n\nMiss Miyagi supports private people that want to develop buildings. They run nine months long processes. Three months preparation, including need assessment and a market survey around the building. They take a fee on every step of the process. They never invest in the land or in the building, so they do not risk. This method also supports owners with \"unsellable\" buildings. They only worked in Flanders for now: the legal system in BXL and Wallonia is different. Now they have our first assignment in Brussels, and are eager to work more there. They might be willing to agree to more advantageous conditions for us, as we help them to enter the Brussels market. \"In cities, we know, you have to go to a high level to get things moving. As we are not \"greedy developers\", doors always open for us.\"\n\nThey say: \n\n> We no longer design buildings. This is because we want to be on the user side in the interaction between user, architect and constructor. With one of our clients, called Symbiosis, we ran a competition for architectural concept (NDA Good idea to do with Climate-KIC).\n\n>We have a building in Leuven that looks like what you want to do. Industrial building, formerly a factory of canned fruit. Behind it there is a a smaller building, unsellable because the factory is unused and dilapidated. The owner of the smaller building came to us for help. We proposed an expansion from 600 to 2,500 sqm. Ground and first floor are going to be ateliers, garage-sized, for small tech outfits. Above then, five classic apartments. \n\n> The process looks like this: an owner comes to us with a building, always a very complicated history. Initially, we do a nine month batch. We talk to regulators to find out what is possible. We work out three scenarios: each one is legally possible (actually comes with pre-consent), and comes with calculations. If the scenario includes 50 sqm ateliers, we know exactly how much this is going to cost. This is divided into seven steps, and you can exit at any one of them if you think it's not going to lead to a solution you want. Overall it costs 12K EUR. The seller of the building pays for it. \n\n> Then, when it goes to market, we take 3% from the buyer (not the seller). We are real estate agents, we are licensed for that. \n\nThey already work with cities in Flanders. There are two formulas: \n\n* Concessions, from 30 to 99 years. You pay for it: the amount is the capital value of the building, distributed over the duration of the concession, with a very low interest rate (1-2%). \n* Temporary allocation + option (done in Leuven). You take over a large area for five years, and make it into a safer, more attractive place. At the end of the period, you have an option to buy (or get a concession for) part of the surface.", "created_at": "2018-10-19 14:51:06.324257", "updated_at": "2019-12-06 10:12:04.749972", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 745, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 78.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 48366, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 9112, "post_number": 2, "raw": "This looks interesting.

Saying this is blunt, especially because what those two have achieved &amp; the inexhaustible energy and investment they have made is legend &amp; inspiring. But this is not about the what... it's about the how. Arguably, the other major unhelpful aspect of leadership from Alberto &amp; Nadia is they have been so close to this for so long that they have understandably long ago lost the distinction between having a close connection to something and having a self-compromising ATTACHMENT. They both need to not mind what happens (don't we all! but we're not steering a ground-breaking, work-redefining project - &amp; they indisputably are).

I suggest we ask Linda Joy Mitchell [2], or someone equally brilliant at bringing teams together, to save us from our shadow selves &amp; recognise it will need time &amp; some face-to-face rapprochement.

Alberto is right when he says someone needs to be a right bastard at times. The Do-ocracy concept that bypasses do-nothing's who merely sour the action with negative comments is hard ethics in the name of productivity. I don't doubt for a second that you both care to the core.

We have had with us inspiring women fighting extremism and gender inequality in their communities, young people working on empowering poor kids who have no access to proper education, others working on founding a bio hacking spaces in a marginalized areas and many other great stories of amazing efforts towards the development of communities in the MENA region. Through these calls, those change makers were able to collect feedback, suggestions and sometimes critics from their peers but also from experts who joined the conversation, and overall connections were made for future collaboration. \nTake for example the **Hackathon** which will take place next month in **Medenine** (Tunisia). This was the result of a an exciting conversation between  @Yosser and @Hugi  which happened during a community call. \n\nThis proves once again that the power of collective intelligence is limitless, and we should use that to empower all the changemakers who join our community. We voluntarily  choose to support and guide them through their journey of making a positive impact on their communities or on people in need. Many great things are happening around the world and everywhere, but they are working alone, and many are in the darkness. They are doing their best to address issues . \n\nIt is time for a program that can reach out to all these outstanding changemakers, whom I love to call \u201cthe doers\u201d, and the community calls program may be the simplest and most optimized way to do that. To implement and to scale out this project , we will face many challenges to overcome  before having something up and running by its own, but also we will have a lot of fun and discoveries along the way. They say that the journey of 1000 miles begins with a single step, and in our case, things won\u2019t be different, we have to take that single step. In order to do that, we need our \u201cearly adopters\u201d of \u201cSuperheros\u201d from the Edgeryders community , who believe that we can work it out, who believe in the power of collective intelligence and who are willing to contribute and support by advice and guidance great young changemakers . But make no mistake, this is a win-win relationship. In the process, you will be able to gain a valuable knowledge and discover new opportunities for businesses and/or for collaboration. \n\nNow we do not have, in purpose, a structured methods on how we will implement this. We prefer to co develop this along with our \u201csupeheros\u201d. But, IMHO, we have two approaches to test beforehand and your feedback is more than welcome: \n\n**1-The first one** is to put the \u201csuperheros\u201d at the center of the calls, where each time we invite a \u201csuper hero\u201d, as our special guest in the community call, in order to discuss a topic of her or his choice depending on her or his expertise. We will mobilize young changemakers or future changemakers from around the MENA region (in first stage) to attend these calls. \n\nTalking about this, I would like to share with you one idea that has emerged from my last meetings with collaborative spaces owners in Sousse-Tunisia: \u201c**Online Tech Talks**\u201d. In Tunisia for example, and this I think is the case of many other countries in MENA and Africa, there are a lot of well educated and qualified young people who are so passionate about new technologies. Trust me, you will be surprised by their potential and their energy. We can engage with these talents in very fruitful conversations through the \u201cOnline Tech talks\u201d which could lead to great and inspiring ventures, you may find either the talents you are looking for or the next big idea to invest in.  \n   \n**2- The second one** to put the change makers, as we used to do, at the center of our calls and we invite her or his peers along with the superheros who may be experts in the same field. \n\nEither way, what we need to do now, is to build a list of superheros among our communities, with whom we can engage in conversations and see how to take our community calls together to the next level and how we can plan with them the next calls. \nFell free to leave your comments or contact me by private message on the platform to share you contact details, your areas of expertise and your availability for the next months.\n\nYour feedback is always welcome and strongly appreciated.", "created_at": "2018-10-20 15:31:06.212736", "updated_at": "2018-10-20 15:31:06.212736", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 787, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 258.8, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3904, 8, 2915, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 48067, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 9114, "post_number": 5, "raw": "We used to.

What it sounds so strange is the lack of interest of car manufacturers (and the whole automotive sector in general) towards the recovery of these valuable components from End-of-Life Vehicles (ELVs). Maybe, the complex set of barriers (e.g. regulatory, governance-based, market, technological, cultural, societal, gender, etc.) companies must cope with when implementing Circular Economy (CE) are making very difficult its adoption, by limiting potential benefits. All these data show as, even if car manufacturers are investing big capitals trying to shift their business towards more sustainable mobility concepts, the sectorial transition towards CE seems to be far from its completion. Especially at End-of-Life (EoL) phase, there are still many issues to be solved in order to functionally recover materials from cars (e.g. reuse recovered materials for the same purpose they were exploited originally) and the dependence from natural resources when producing new cars (even if electric/hybrid/fuel cell - powered) is still too high. This mandatory systemic transformation requires to all companies/sectors to redefine products lifecycles since the beginning, by considering CE already before to design them. To this aim, the TREASURE project wants to develop a scenario analysis simulation tool able to quantify positive and negative implications of CE, by leading the European automotive supply chain towards its full transition to CE.*\n\n## What did we promise? \n\nAn online conversation on circular economy, focusing on the automotive sector. We are to explore how CE plays out in society, economy and everyday life, the points of\nview of the people directly affected by CE. Our platform is considered as a tool to involve consumers and awareness raising. \n\nWe are the lead of the **WP2 Circularity & sustainability assessment methods**\n**integration & application**, leading only 1 out of 3 tasks there. Basically our standard WP became one task in WP2 and another in WP4: \n\n**T2.3 TREASURE social impact assessment through a large-scale online conversation.** (Leader: EDGE, Contributors: all other partners, M1-M12). In sum, it consists of: \n\n- creating the TREASURE online forum, stewarded by trained community managers (since M5). Defining \u201crules of engagement/netiquette\u201d to serve as a social contract underpinning interaction on TREASURE.\n- a community journalism program (10 commissioned posts) to create \u201cseed\u201d content and attract new users and contributions. \n- 10 onboarding events (e.g. participatory co-creation workshops) aimed at collecting and reporting success stories about CE practices in the automotive industry on the TREASURE online forum. \n- code the TREASURE conversation in-platform, producing and maintaining a set of ontologies under the form of wikis containing the list of adopted codes and their definition. \n- a set of dedicated KPIs (e.g. no. of participants, no. of forum posts, no. of onboarding events, % of nodes in the SSNA) will be measured. \n- providing technical support throughout the project. \n- developing Data Management Plan and engaging Ethics Advisor.\n\n**Task 4.3. Semantic social network analysis module** (Leader: EDGE, M12-M30)\n- combining primary and secondary data (WP2, T.2.3) in a Semantic Social Network (SSN).\n- data will be visualized with an interactive dashboard built on Graphryder to get strongest connections, drilling down interesting ethnographic codes and making inferences associated with specific codes. \n- All these actions will allow to define a CE ethnography of the European automotive industry and make some recommendations to be implemented in the modules developed in T4.4.\n\nMy concern is the duration (M1-12) for the task 2.3.

We have early access to the 1000 m2 building in the Frihamnen harbour close to central Stockholm. Edgeryders will have a presence in the house, where I will work alongside @brooks and others on the [Participio Development Lab](https://edgeryders.eu/t/participio-development-lab/9108) and other Edgeryders projects. Most of that work will happen on the second floor of the house, in what we call **Studio Beta** \u2013 a participatory workspace for 20 to 30 members. On the first floor, we will have 300 m2 of art workshop and maker space with large cutting tables, a laser cutter, a CNC-machine, woodworking equipment and a large format printer. Artists, designers and makers can become members of this space we call **Studio Tau**, which is also available to all members of Studio Beta. Finally, our community centre [Noden](https://www.noden.community/) will live on at Blivande and be the beating heart of the house. All photos of from last night are from the Node rooms of Blivande, which will also be an event space for workshops, concerts, seminars, conferences and parties.\n\nThis will be a home for Edgeryders in Stockholm, and once we open I'll make sure all relevant information is available on how to come and work at Studio Beta while doing Edgeryders stuff.\n\nIn the coming months, a lot of work will go into getting the second floor ready for the first members of Studio Beta who will start working there in January. We have two architects working on the floor plan and concept and will start building and refurbishing in November. \n\n## Studio Beta floor plan (2d. floor of the Blivande House)\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7a1cefd8eb43beab732350ac393a9bf3cee8d0fb.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"488\">\n\nToday I've been working from the still empty but beautiful rooms on the first floor.

A good starting point is the [Productivity, Employment and Inequality](http://ide.mit.edu/research-pillars/productivity-employment-and-inequality) working group at IDE-MIT. A nice piece of work that combines the two items of the list is [Robots Are Us: Some Economics of Human Replacement](https://www.nber.org/papers/w20941), by Benzell, Kotlikoff, LaGarda and Sachs. You do not need to read the math to get the main message: without \"carefully crafted\nredistribution policies\" a large fraction of the labour force will be unable to buy what smart machines produce. I like the topics, but I think that cannot be disjoint from the inequality issue.\n\n**Reputation and gift economies**: @Alberto, it is not clear to me what you mean with \"reputation\" and \"gift\".  Reputation is crucial for the credit system, trade and in the labour market, your references to _Distraction_ and _Daemon_ seem to point at something similar. Gifts are different, and, as you point out in your post about the economics of _Walkaway_, the crucial point is if they are originated by intrinsic or extrinsic motivation. For _The Dispossessed_, I do not see neither reputation nor gifts at work.

Since no human can be as effective at trading as machines, the economy evolves towards a system called \"Economics 2.0\", where the search for gain drives the economic system to gradually turn the whole mass in the solar system into a giant computational stratum (\"computronium\").

I've recently been investigating a technology called Scuttlebutt. Basically, it's a technology that makes it possible to have a social network (or any other data) which is fully encrypted and both accessible online and offline. [It's described pretty well in this post.](https://medium.com/@richdecibels/this-machine-eats-monotheistic-meta-memes-797449d34d34)\n\nMy thinking is this. Refugees who are on the move need information that is up to date and a way to connect with each other. However, they might not always have data coverage or wifi, although they have smartphones. It would be good if refugee A (who has no wifi for a week) could get all the data and info that refugee B has (who has had wifi recently but not now).\n\nWith a technology like Scuttlebutt, this is possible by letting person A connect with the device of person B and get all the updated information (including any personal messages to person A, which person B will then have on encryped on their device and are unable to access). It's a bit hard to explain in short terms, but this is operational technology.

Will wait for the final confirmation which way to go for time tracking for the POPREBEL project. Please find out the same for NGI Forward as well \u2013 to avoid process confusion on our side, we'd only use the \"calculate the reported hours\" method if both projects are fine with that. (I doubt it though, as even UCL's guidance notes on [their timesheet template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yIAHq5986KOudrAN118Q9_4NwNZQNt0a/view) say: \"5. Enter ACTUAL hours carried out for work on a daily basis\").\n\nHow the time tracking process would look like in each case:\n\n\n#### If we can report calculated hours\n\n1. We'll not track any time inside FreeAgent in that case but adapt the [timesheet template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yIAHq5986KOudrAN118Q9_4NwNZQNt0a/view) spreadsheet to be a Google Docs document per collaborator that will calculate the to-be-reported hours with formulas in the spreadsheet.\n\n2. To record the signature, we let the consultant upload a signature image right into the spreadsheet file. Then the supervisor (who must be the document owner) will also sign that month's spreadsheet tab and then protect it against further changes. This makes sure nobody can come in later and change the signed data after the signature was done; and anyway, such changes would be recorded by Google Sheets.\n\n3. Then we have a master spreadsheet that uses `IMPORTRANGE()` to collect to-be-reported hours from user spreadsheets, right into the UCL / NESTA financial reporting template spreadsheet.\n\n\n#### If we have to report actual hours\n\n1. We keep tracking time in FreeAgent as proposed in the first post above. But we use tasks, not just work packages, as the units to track time for, because that seems to be required (\"Reference to the action tasks and WP of annex 1\"). Also, we include the EU project number into the project name as that is required to appear on timesheet reports (\"The title and number of the action as per the GA\").\n\n2. We let users create PDF exports of their timesheet reports from FreeAgent. If \"normally monthly\" means that we can also do it less often (before the next financial reports are due, every 6 or 12 months), that's much better because it saves admin overhead.\n\n3. Users upload the to-be-signed PDF file to a signature web service like [digisigner.com](http://digisigner.com) that we still have to select (there are several). The user signs, then invites the \"supervisor\" to sign, who also signs (technically, only after checking that the data conforms to the user's FreeAgent timesheet report). After this, the signed timesheet PDF contains all the required information.\n\n4. Contrary to the current proposal at the top of the topic, users no longer have to attach the timesheets to their invoices, as that would make signing and countersigning a mess. Instead, we use the signature web service to store our signed and countersigned timeslip documents, and occasionally create backups of them to Google Drive. If we can create timeslips every 6 or 12 months, we'll directly save them to Google Drive as well as it's not too much overhead then.\n\n    (Unfortunately, we cannot store the signed FreeAgent timesheets in the [FreeAgent Files section](https://support.freeagent.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001223344-Storing-company-files). Because that is a section for private files uploaded by each user, not even accessible by the admins of a FreeAgent account. I just tested that.)\n\n5. As proposed at the top of the topic, we then use our custom-made financial reporting utility to pull the timesheet data from FreeAgent and calculate the person months, sums of expenses etc. for copy&pasting to the financial reporting template.\n\n    Since FreeAgent time tracking data can be edited / amended at any time, technically the project administrator would have to cross-check this with the signed timesheet reports to exclude tampering with the data. But that would be a rough plausibility check only. Our tool would still make the process more efficient.\n\n[quote=\"anique.yael, post:12, topic:9143\"]In any case I'd like us to do a test export of the data in a spreadsheet with you before we finalise the tool.[/quote]\n\nThe only thing we can do right now (i.e. before there is a tool that exports spreadsheets) is to test if with my process FreeAgent will contains the necessary data to export the spreadsheets. You can already do that (just assume we'll do time tracking inside FreeAgent). You'd create some test expenses and time tracking entries, create and check the data on FreeAgent time tracking reports, and manually make sure that all the data for filling the financial reporting template is present as well.\n\nOn my side I'm confident all the necessary data is there as I created the process.

This will use FreeAgent as a time tracker because you left the worktime field at 0:00.\nAs before but also fill in the worktime field and if necessary the date. This allows to record the worktime for a single day.\nClick \"Add Weekly Timesheet\". This allows to efficiently take over your worktime tracking from another application.\n[/quote]\n\nSo are these three different options for time worked to be entered? For example, most of the time I work many more hours than I'm paid for and using a time tracker would not be a good idea. But in this case I could use the third option of a weekly timesheet correct?\n\n**On work packages**\n\n[quote=\"matthias, post:1, topic:9143\"]\nYou can save it as a PDF and attach it to your invoice, or you can take over the subtotals per work package (calculated manually) and put these as individual invoice items. It is ok to invoice for multiple work packages in one invoice.\n[/quote]\n\nSo I'm just not quite clear on the the manual calculation of the subtotals per work package - can you share more on how this is done?\n\n**On expense types**\n\nSo this is where things get a little tricky and I appreciate how you've approached it. For example, yes what is a direct cost haha. \n\nI propose the following changes:\n\n- _subcontract_ is changed to _Direct costs - services_ because subcontracting is a whole other kettle of fish in H2020 and if/ when we are audited it will be very confusing \n\n- _support_ is changed to _Direct costs - goods_ because this is the other part of what Direct costs covers. For example, the food used to feed people at an onboarding workshop\n\n- _non-eligible_ is changed to _Indirect costs_ because there is 25% of each project's budget that is actually allocated for company overheads and this will be useful for internal and potential external auditing also I believe.\n\n**On calculations**\n\nWhat I'm not seeing here is **how people's hours are then translated into their PMs**? PM = person month = a stupidly complex calculation of personnel time. Ours is set at 6000 and this is how all our personnel costs are budgeted for in the projects. The following is an excerpt from the OPENCARE budget tracker for calculating the annual productive hours and hourly rate that is the best synthesis I've found so far. There's this weird back working mechanism where we are budgetd PMs and then need to create hourly rates and hours and then return them back to PMs. You may like to check out the Annotated Model Grant Agreement [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uP3PJJ3clgBxgEBFBMBjVa4QJP2tbt7Q) on pp54 - 58 where it is referring to Article 6.2.A.1 (which begins on p42) if you want more explanation. I do apologise for the horrible language - I'm still wrapping my head around it myself but once we have the formulae in place it's rather simple.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/8/82d26e5f7d9e950911d1d9ddec22df74551ad3f0.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"431\">\n-\nThis is one of the stickier sides of reporting where University of Bordeaux had a formula in built into their timesheet tracker to work out the PM. I see Nesta just has the PM number, which means that according to the GA, we have to have the calculation \"within our own cost accounting practices.\" \n\n**IE. Hourly rate = PM multiplied by 12 months divided by 1720 productive hours per year.**\n\n**EG. My hourly rate = 6000 * 12 / 1720 = 41.86**\n\nThe thing is that at times we will have people on different hourly rates (a project coordinator or junior comms person may be paid less for example). So we need to build that into the system. \n\nThanks for your understanding if this isn't so clear. Please let me know what else I can do to make it clearer.\n\n**In response to your questions**\n\n[quote=\"matthias, post:2, topic:9143\"]\nHow often do the reporting templates have to be filled and sent, i.e. what is the \"Period\" mentioned in the NESTA Financial Reporting Template?\n[/quote]\n\nPeriodic reporting depends on the project but I believe ranges 6 month (min) - 12 month (max) increments. For example, for POPREBEL we have to do 6 monthly internal reports and yearly reports to the Commission. (We've advocated for the internal reports to be blog posts here FYI).\n\n[quote=\"matthias, post:2, topic:9143\"]\nThe UCL reporting templates do not include a \"Periodic Financial Report\".

Will we remove the ability for people to link to a Trello, Google Doc, etc. if they want to, or will we still give users an input field where they can put anything, and simply give them some extra powers if it happens to be a Loomio/Talk link?\n[/quote]\n\nI think deliberation links should be able to be anything. However, if they are from Loomio/Talk, this should be sensed and the Deliberation node should somehow be represented to show that, and also show if it's a thread or a group. I guess it would be pretty easy to have three cases here:\n\n- If deliberation link is **not** Loomio thread, represent as unclassified Info node\n- If deliberation link is Loomio thread, show thread title and indicate that it's a thread\n- If deliberation link is group, show group title and allow it to be set as default discussion group, which means that it's recommended as the place to post things and make decisions on this subject\n- If a default group is set for a Need, perhaps this should be set as the default also for any responsibility created fulfilling that Need? It can then be removed or replaced if it doesn't fit, but at least there is some indication of where to go to talk.\n\nOf course this adds some logic and code to this feature, but is reasonably straight forward, though it requires us to implement the functions talking to the Loomio API first.

Bonjour Quebec was created in 2010, and although opendata was strongly implemented elsewhere in the world, and even in the Rest of Canada, by a few cities, the concept of opendata had not yet landed in the Quebecois land in 2010. As a matter of fact, it just barely arrived now, since the City of Montreal has launched its opendata portal only last November 2011, about 6 months ago. And the province of Quebec announcement occured just 2 days ago.\n\nThe issues described by Alberto apply to the federal (Canadian) opendata portal.\n\nI will keep the Laurentius\u2019 suggestions on the ice until the end of this year. The government of Quebec announced a second portal, to be up around December 2012, where citizens are supposed be allowed to propose improvements and ideas.

I believe in open (in the sense of free to join), rational conversation as the engine to achieve, well... truth, if that's not too big a word. Data are \"only\" fuel for the conversation. But, data being what they are, it seems to me that drawing attention to them could channel the conversation onto healthier terrain. Why? Because they give you ammo to win an argument, or to make a forceful point, <em>but to use that ammo you have to argue rationally</em>. Of course one could always pretend to do so and spread lies, but that does not really matter, because (1) in the debate someone else is likely to see through the lies and unmask them and (2) by crafting a fake rational argument one has to pay tribute to the language of rationality, and this in itself marginalizes the loudest, most drooling hatemongers and demagogues. Competition between participants should make the conversation converge towards rational argument.\n\nOf course, the more people buy into rational argument the stronger this competitive force will be, the faster the convergence.

I have sought to stay out of this as far as possible up until the point where conflict threatens the well being of individual unMonasterians, and what we are trying to achieve together. On location and remotely as the wider Edgeryders community. I think you bring up a crucial point which is worth reiterating:\n\n<blockquote>\n\n\"EdgeRyders are doers. The culture is one of a do-ocracy. Each individual tends to be strong willed and motivated to speak through action - long meetings are an anathema. Talking to Ben before the Global Strategy Summit I pointed to the problem of changing culture, and the need to take at least a full day planning this. Even with a simple agile planning session to organise the next weeks work, it is strongly recommended to take a full day. A significant shift in strategy and group culture takes at least this. However, this would have been very difficult to talk the group into, even half a day out of individual schedules is met with understandable resistance. The 2 hours meeting we had failed even to report back, and we never got down to the task of looking closely at rationalisation of resources and project overlaps.\"\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<strong>The rule we operate by is rough consensus and running code.\u00a0</strong>As in,\u00a0<strong>no one can veto anyone else's ideas or work.</strong>\u00a0\n\nIf you don't like an idea or an approach, build a better one. At a minimum, build on what is there so that it includes whatever you feel is missing. \u00a0The unMonastery is a community project and is free to be developed by anyone who puts in the work of creating the conditions for it to continue. In Matera or elsewhere. Those who do not like the offered resources are very welcome to do the work of securing others.\n\n<strong>We also tend to avoid physical meetings because they are too high bandwidth and not particularly condusive to getting things done</strong>.\u00a0\n\nWorking out loud, online where the primary mode of communication is in writing has several advantages in this respect.\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>You are forced to communicate with clarity\u00a0</strong>as you are writing for a broad audience and cannot rely on hidden assumptions or others sharing your biases and pre-concieved ideas. Having others ask questions and having to think abuout responses is a great way to achieve this clarity. We know it works. It's part of the reason why there is an unMonastery at all.</li>\n\n<li><strong>You are reminded to stick to a certain social protocol</strong>\u00a0because you are in a public space. Just knowing others are watching helps us to exercise constraint and self-discipline in our interactions with one another.</li>\n\n<li><strong>It allows for decentralised collaboration\u00a0</strong>where everyone can contribute by aligning their work or participating when and if they can. Because you know what others are doing, what is needed and can more easily figure out how you can be useful.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nFor example, a huge burden of translating communication has been disproportionately shouldered by Italian speakers \u00a0in the unMonastery. Edgeryderas supports different languages and <a href=\"/comment/9870#comment-9870\">you can easily contribute a translation of a text</a> on the platform. Which means you guys could do a call for members of the community who speak and write Italian to contribute remotely to alleviate some of the workload off Italian unMonastery residents.\n\n<strong>Those who are concerned about and wish to contribute to the continued existence of the unMonastery Matera presence in some form are welcome to contribute to the\u00a0<a href=\"/t/che-fare-unmonastery-matera/552/sustainability-plan-first-iteration\">sustainability plan</a>.</strong> Perhaps you have other ways in which you can contribute? Please feel free to share them on the edgeryders platform. They would be much appreciated by everyone I am sure.\n\nAt a minimum I ask<strong>\u00a0that everyone respect others' efforts</strong>\u00a0to contribute to this beautiful project in their own ways.\n\nWe are building something quite remarkable together and it needs all of us to pitch in what we can.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-17 10:11:00", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:52.481607", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 744, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16901, "user_id": 3559, "topic_id": 3539, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Travlou </b>\n\nSo glad you went,  if I had known I would have gone too I'm a big fan of travlou's research and can't recommend it enough\n\nhttp://elmcip.net/person/penny-travlou\n\nPreviously I'd sent her work to Ben &amp; Nadia by email.

Esos tipos se pelean con fantasmas.\n\nMientras que hay episodios de datos <em>no </em>abiertos que alguien periodista encontr\u00f2 y public\u00f2 sobre el web, y despues los ciudadanos s\u00ec los utilizaranon contra la administraci\u00f2n que <em>no </em>los liber\u00f2. Por exemplo, los gastos de los integrantes del Parlamento del Reino Unido publicados por el Telegraph y despues el Guardian en forma (mas o menos) abierta en el <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_parliamentary_expenses_scandal\">esc\u00e0ndalo de los parliamentary expenses</a>. Le decisi\u00f2n de no liberar estos datos fue un boomerang total: cre\u00f2 un clima horrible, con los ciudadanos sospechando de todo.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-30 17:05:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:20.215828", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 177, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [6992], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 48899, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 9159, "post_number": 16, "raw": "Aha, OK.
