Check that  `\u201cAllowed user api auth redirects\u201d` is enabled in the Admin and configure the redirect URL to return to after the user has logged in.

I would especially look for something that incorporates the social infrastructure - the <em>open community building</em> part which is definitory in opencare.\n\nIt is in\u00a0your second part \"<em>Which are the lectures we can learn from what has been done until now?</em>\" where I see\u00a0various steps to analyse deeper the opencare early results and future\u00a0impact.\u00a0How do we break down this idea of collective capacity, from a network perspective..?\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>using ethnographic data:\u00a0start from the (shared) meanings that members\u00a0attach to taking action of sorts\u00a0- conceptualizations of collaboration, community, resources, \"working together\" and other relevant\u00a0codes etc. How they see the benefits of being part of a network\u00a0and so on.. I think this could be the departing argument for more coordinated actions\u00a0needed, independent of the opencare initial premise and strict project life.</li>\n\n<li>show examples of opencare team designed actions - openandchange, PopUp Village and others\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>show examples of non-team/ member led actions\u00a0- people hook up and start working together in or outside the opencare formalized community\n\nTo me, this distinction between team/non-team, as blurred as it can be\u00a0is needed when looking at capacity, it explains the different\u00a0resources, incentives that are in the network..\n\nI am not sure we can put design lenses on all examples\u00a0above.. but I am far from an expert.

If I remember correctly, it was intended right from the start to make the platform software open source, because it's a taxpayer funded project. That release day is approaching ... . With the software being open source, the question of \"who controls the hosting\" becomes less of an issue.\n\nThen, we have discussions how to make the platform and its further development a community-steered process. Like: behind the link you gave, we also have a discussion <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/community-heroes/mission_case/what-do-you-want-new-edgeryders-platform-software#comment-4253\">here</a> that we want to add a feature request / community decision making tool to the platform.\n\nThe question you raise (of how the platform should be governed) is very much a work in progress \u2013 welcome to add to the discussion. Im interested esp. in: Do you have real-life examples how making up a legal entity could help to warrant a stable, community-steered platform development? (I see that you folks are really into this topic and I'm following the discussion a bit, but I don't have experience with this stuff ...)\n\nA personal idea that came to me some days ago and that I'd like to throw into the discussion here: We could make the platform a rather generic free software project, apt for other \"meta-communities\" like ours, as well. Because that's what I see Edgeryders as: we connect all kinds of existing, local communities and projects, with synergy benefits and inspiration for everybody.\n\nSo Edgeryders (with its 2.0 agenda) is, in my understanding: the github.com for \"socially relevant stuff\". Or something similar to the Spanish 15M movement's <a href=\"https://n-1.cc/\">N-1</a> network (based on open source <a href=\"http://elgg.org/\">ELGG</a> + <a href=\"https://lorea.org/\">Lorea</a>).

Key value in Edgeryders: foregrounding documentation; that there is always a next step after an event\nHis interest is in figuring out: \n\n**_How does the local conversation connect to the international, wider, distributed series of conversation?_**\n\nNatalia - wants concrete actions. Saw this upcoming Festival in building outside Berlin - we can potentially work with the organisers - one off event on a site that will soon be demolished.\n\nNoemi - Not an arts person, but a social scientist. Community manager and board member. Part of the bigger effort to push the growth of the wider company and organisation. Keeping an eye on the connections as we grow. Building Units within the network. Overlap with what Hugi is doing at Blivande (in Stockholm). How can the ER network be useful within this sphere? Wants to see sustainable collaboration happening and people making a living out of the work that they/we can do. Moving beyond the project-to-project cycle? Build a platform that figures out ways to grow distributed and through partnership.  Reputation building. Connecting the dots. We want to build that online conversation part to see where that goes next.\n\n**_The Networked Conversations should build a business card and over time help us figure out a business model for the Culture Squad._** \n\n## Questions asked, answered and lingering\n\n- Marili: Wants to understand exactly how we have proceeded so far. Is it a project/ a platform? Do we intend to apply for funding?\n\nIt's a platform that is meant to create new and sustainable collaborations and projects between participants, and for edgeryders. i.e. people supporting each other, writing applications together, organising events and what not. We do it for a season of 6 months like a project - and then reflect on learnings to see if it can continue, and with what changes/ additions to the format..\n\n- Dan: How we see the interrelations between the local and international level?\n\nNoemi:\nFrom organisers: focus on finding a format which works there. low investment, not overstretch or add to existing workload! \nFrom ER: tasked with connecting layers, helping with community management, support for documentation. \nAlex:\nWider connecting question/topic & local specifics.\n\n- Marili: What is covering the costs of events? What are our target participants?\n\nWe can find venues easily, and ER will cover costs of food/ drinks. We will make sure to cover the cost of the performative dinner at the end.\nThe most expensive is the time of those who organise - which is why it needs to be very simple AND it needs to add value to work which we already do, questions we already have - see process below.\n\n## Process for organisers\n\nPresented by Alex -LINK TO PROCESS coming up!\n\nAlex: Find a wider topic we want to address and then drilling down into a specific question which we aim to talk in detail about - so that the conversation moves forward.\n\n* The formal depends on your personal preference: panels, workshop, just chatting.\n* How is it best to promote the event? open/ closed?\n* How important is it that you involve people from outside your circle?\n\nDan: How important is it that you have the same people at each event?\nThe work between the sessions: documentation - I found very appealing; the 2-3 hrs commitment can be documentation work; it&rsquo;s exciting because it gets people to do something else other than talking\n\nNaomi: Space to have intimate conversations vs something larger than the city\nBetween each conversations to facilitate the online space - have events in between; sending it out there, regrouping into your local context; &ldquo;we are a local component part of a larger group&rdquo;\n\nNoemi: it would be great if local teams will take this on, but for me it's important that we dont over-commit. Hosting the events+ good documentation is a good point to start with, then if people want to take it further it will be very useful!\n\n\n## TO DO\n\nWebsite for the Culture Squad featuring the Conversations front page - work-in-progress, will be up by 1st of April\n\nCan you all revise the proposed calendar and let me know dates we can lock in\n\n9 April               \t| Brussels\n2 May\t\t\t| Brussels\n8 May\t\t\t| Bedford\n9 May       \t        | Berlin\n25 June\t\t        | Brussels\n7 August\t         \t| Bedford\n14 September         | Brussels\n20 September\t\t| Berlin\n31 October\t\t| Athens\nXXX                         | Yerevan??\n15 November\t\t| PERFORMATIVE DINNER  (can also be later?)", "created_at": "2019-03-16 08:37:00.192748", "updated_at": "2019-03-19 08:51:11.705841", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1153, "wiki": true, "reads": 13, "score": 97.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2201, 347], "is_private": false}, {"id": 58969, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 10714, "post_number": 2, "raw": "[quote=\"anon82932460, post:1, topic:10714\"]\n[POST COMMUNIST BUBBLE]\n\nNoemi, the co-founder of Edgeryders, grew up in post-communist Romania.

Sadly @amelia, who had set the whole thing up, could not be with us. Director Bruce White and researcher Emilia Groupp presented a theoretical model meant to detect and contrast what they call the \"weaponization of identities\" to fan the flame of conflict. When these guys say \"conflict\" they mean it: they are accustomed to operating in war zones. Places like Rwanda and Kosovo came up a lot. \n\nI barely understand the model, but I am going to summarize it anyway here, for the benefit of discussion. Bruce and Emilia can always correct me. Here we go:\n\n1. In a \"default\" (non-weaponized) state, people have access to concepts, which are arranged into a network. From what I understand, this is a sort of associations pattern. For example, for Bruce \"grandfather\" might be connected to \"Oxford\", because his grandfather went to Oxford.\n\n2. This network is nonrandom. Starting from a sort of \"root node\", people access \"versions of themselves\" that correspond to certain subgraphs of the main concept network. For example, I might have an economist version of myself, with concepts like \"consumer theory\", \"Hirschman\", and \"demand function\", quite tightly associated to each other.  I might also have a musician version of myself, with concepts like \"accordion\", \"rhythm\" and \"touring\", also quite tightly associated to each other. Getting from \"demand function\" to \"touring\" is harder than getting to \"consumer theory\". In network language, my associations graph is modular. Nodes communities in it correspond to versions of myself.\n\n3. Here it gets tricky. Part of my association patterns describe my identities, which will normally be multiple. I can identify as European, Italian, runner, economist etc. Weaponization of identity consists of external intervention that tries to limit my access to one or more versions of my identity. For example, I might be discouraged by a nationalist attacker to see myself as a European, and only see myself as Italian. *Weaponization is recognizable because it denies people access to some versions of themselves*.\n\nThe nice thing about this model is that it can immediately tell weaponization (evil) from other non-evil cultural influences: the former restricts access to someone's identities, whereas the latter extends it. It is never wrong to argue that you can see yourself as something else _as well_. For example, I could identify as a heir to the Roman empire who occupied Northern Italy since republican times; someone telling me that I might as well claim the legacy of the (later romanized) Celtic tribes that inhabited the area earlier does not constitute a weaponization of my identity, _unless_ he tries to deny my ties with the Romans. \n\nBut this model is super difficult to operationalize for someone like me. We spent half the seminar asking pretty low-level questions: what constitutes data? How do we collect them? How do we interpret them? How do we define \"links\" in this context?\n\nI enjoyed the time in Oxford. Bruce, Emilia and I were standing just at the edge of being able to understand each other, shouting to cover the distance across our disciplines and research styles. It is clearly a generative place to be, if an exhausting one.

What is the purpose of this initiative?**\n\nThe Science Fiction Economics Lab attempts to extend the space of economic models that are conceivable and deployable to build a successful, fair civilisation, while preserving the planet\u2019s ecological balance. Inspired by science fiction, we nurture and support new, radical ways to think about the economy and economic policy. This activity is part of a project we are conducting with support from **[EIT Climate-KIC ](https://www.climate-kic.org/)** ,the European Union\u2019s largest climate innovation initiative. More info: [http://scifieconomicslab.net ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/science-fiction-economics/13927)\n\n**2. Do I have to take part?**\n\nNo. You can ask questions about the initiative before deciding whether or not to participate in the webinar or workshop. If you do agree to participate, you may withdraw yourself and the data you have provided from the documentation of the event, without giving a reason and without penalty, by advising the team . If after the interview/call you choose to withdraw, please contact Maria Kling.\n\n**3. What will happen if I take part in this webinar or workshop?**\n\nThe event takes place digitally. It consists of an open discussion, moderated by Edgeryders staff and or workshops provided by community members.\n\nIf you take part in the event you will be able to listen and contribute to the discussion.\n\nThe call will be recorded for reference purposes for the Science Fiction Economics Lab described above and the facilitator to improve similar webinars.\n\nEdgeryders staff will write a report of the event to be published in the platform to share all outcomes.\n\n**4. Are there any potential risks in taking part?**\n\nThe risks of participation are minimal and include for example involuntary data breach leading to sharing beyond the original intention. We are prepared and committed to prevent any of this.\n\n**5. Are there any benefits in taking part?**\n\nThere are no direct benefits to you for participating in this discussion. As a result it may have indirect benefit to participants.\n\nAs a benefit of participating in the webinar or workshop part you will learn new information and make new contacts that you will be able to use for your own projects and benefits.\n\nThere will be no payment for taking part in this event. The webinar or workshop is free.\n\n**6. How is the event documented?**( *ATTENTION: Changes to this section* )\nThis call is being recorded.  **The recording will be used for transcription, inform follow-up summary articles and can be published by Edgeryders in parts or its entirety.**\nIf you are not comfortable with the recording of the conversation being published afterwards to further the discussion, you will have to abstain from this call.\nIf you do not want your name being mentioned in the summaries/recordings, please, use a synonym to join (for example your edgeryders user name) and inform us ahead of the call via the contact listed below.\n\n**7. Will the research be published?**\n\nOne or more writeups will appear on the Science Fiction Economics Lab's online forum ([https://edgeryders.eu/c/earthos/sci-fi-economics ](https://edgeryders.eu/c/earthos/sci-fi-economics)). Writeups will be attributed to their authors, not the participants. That is an open forum, so participants are welcome to use it to comment, respond, or contribute their own writeups.\n\nThe whole content of the [Scifi Economics Lab](https://edgeryders.eu/c/earthos/sci-fi-economics) forum (including the mentioned writeup, and any discussion about them) will then become the basis for at least one report. We also hope to publish one or more journal article.\n\n**8. Who is organising and funding this activity?**\n\nThe Scifi Economics Lab and all events formally tied to it are organised by Edgeryders. This event is organised as part of the NGI Forward (https://edgeryders.eu/t/say-hello-to-earthos-why-edgeryders-is-partnering-with-europes-largest-public-private-partnership-for-climate-action/10148) program financed by The European Commission.

Boj\u0119 si\u0119 tego, czuj\u0119 niezgod\u0119 i frustracj\u0119. Nag\u0142a zmiana, kt\u00f3ra si\u0119 wydarza jest dla mnie zbyt drastyczna. Zacz\u0105\u0142em manifestowa\u0107 wobec tego swoje niezadowolenie i wyszed\u0142em na ulic\u0119, gdzie pozna\u0142em nowy rodzaj wsp\u00f3lnoty- wsp\u00f3lnot\u0119 obywatelsk\u0105, kt\u00f3ra staje w obronie warto\u015bci dla mnie fundamentalnych. Wtedy zrozumia\u0142em, \u017ce wsp\u00f3lnota demokratyczna to tak\u017ce obowi\u0105zki, to jest co\u015b o co trzeba dba\u0107, do czego nale\u017cy dok\u0142ada\u0107, stara\u0107 si\u0119, piel\u0119gnowa\u0107.

Niszczymy nie tylko uk\u0142ady spo\u0142eczne, ale i natur\u0119. To zmierza w z\u0142ym kierunku. \n\nZ\u0142o\u015b\u0107, l\u0119k, frustracj\u0119, wcze\u015bniej nawet. Dzi\u0119ki wsp\u00f3lnocie os\u00f3b walcz\u0105cych o demokracj\u0119 pozna\u0142em kilku przyjaci\u00f3\u0142. Z drugiej strony zmiana to\u017csamo\u015bci spowodowa\u0142a utrat\u0119 kilku starych znajomych- po nich spodziewa\u0142em si\u0119 wi\u0119cej zwa\u017cywszy na rang\u0119 zmian, kt\u00f3re maj\u0105 miejsce.

Zszed\u0142em z ulicy, ale mam poczucie, \u017ce zostawi\u0142em walcz\u0105cych. Jako\u015b musz\u0119 z tym \u017cy\u0107. Ale koszty bycia na ulicy by\u0142y dla mnie zbyt wielkie, nie dawa\u0142em sobie z tym rady. Mam du\u017cy szacunek dla ludzi, kt\u00f3rzy maj\u0105 odwag\u0119 walczy\u0107 wci\u0105\u017c o swoje warto\u015bci mimo koszt\u00f3w, kt\u00f3re s\u0105 ogromne. \n\nJak widz\u0119 przysz\u0142o\u015b\u0107?\nFajny \u015bwiat ju\u017c by\u0142.

Nie bierze pod uwag\u0119 rozs\u0105dku i kieruje si\u0119 tylko politycznym interesem.

Facial recognition apps and contract tracing apps have been called into question around the world. Security experts and people like whistleblower Edward Snowden have spoken out about the danger of passing laws around the collection of personal data during the crisis.\n\nIn fact, [our most recent ethnography findings](https://tell.edgeryders.eu/14544) show this was a prominent conversation on the platform over the past four months. Our community has been talking about the risks and harms that these applications and technologies have to data privacy and our civil liberties.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t appear these issues are going away.. Just last week Amazon announced a new palm recognition system that let\u2019s people scan into its shop by waving their hand at the door. It has privacy experts concerned that a biometric scanner that sends pictures of people\u2019s palms into the cloud could be a security risk but will current habits that are being formed around these technologies throughout the pandemic have far-reaching consequences later?\n\nWe have also been examining how an internet that depends on ad revenue to operate and examining the recent policy brief published by Mozilla Fellows Harriety Kingaby and Frederike Kaltheunejust on how that can be fixed [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/what-is-to-be-done-about-the-ad-based-internet-economy/9821/114).\n\nOther conversations that have featured prominently on the platform include coworking, according to our findings. It seems apparent that many have tasted working from home, and while it doesn\u2019t work from everyone, some people have trialled it and like the freedom it brings. One aspect that garnered a lot of attention around that was how the coworking sector can [incorporate childcare ](https://tell.edgeryders.eu/14331)to help working parents during current restrictions.\n\nSimilarly, there has been a lot of talk on the platform on how we can recover from the fallout of this pandemic, and make the pathway we choose a [green one](https://tell.edgeryders.eu/14522).\n\nWe have been reacting to these conversations and discussions, by putting together some events that our community can benefit from. On the 22nd October, we are running a webinar that explores what freelancers need to improve their working days. Please [come along](https://tell.edgeryders.eu/14495) if you\u2019re a freelancer that doesn\u2019t know what to do with all the technology available for the sector to utilise.\n\n**Don\u2019t forget\u2026**\n\nSome of our other upcoming events:\n\n* 16/10 : [Info session about our new World Building academy! ](https://tell.edgeryders.eu/14481)We are launching a residency in collaboration with EIT Climate Kic as part of our Scifi Economics Lab.\n* 30/10: [How can we work together to support localisation of food? 1](https://edgeryders.eu/t/draft-event-invitation-sustainable-agriculture-and-food/14493) A webinar to learn about opportunities in the EU and beyond.

Alessandra was the big surprise, as she had stumbled across us on facebook (!)\n\nGroup introductions: some of us are looking to find space, others struggle with the economics of spaces they have, and yet others look at how squatting evolve into temporary occupations ruled by law, and what makes a future of stability. Everyone wants to move from temporary occupation towards 'perennial urbanism', in the words of Camille. And like many, people need maps to understand the political access to spaces!\n\nThe Case clinic methodology we applied allowed for more in-depth looking at two cases: The Reef 2.0 and Artist Commons future.\n\n## Access to spaces: the case of The Reef 2.0 in-the-making. How to go about finding it?\n\nI pitched Edgeryders plans in the near future in Brussels - to scout for a new community co-living and working space for 20 people. The spin is: [make it a carbon free space and reinvent urban living.](https://edgeryders.eu/t/growing-the-reef-in-brussels-some-initial-thoughts-on-sustainability/8930) We are preliminary funded to do the preparatory work, and will be announcing it soon.\n\nThe advice I got, for which I am very grateful:\n\n* be prepared to circumvent political stakeholders - as things are in Brussels, the system is very complicated to navigate, and it could take too long; also, it's unlikely that the city would invest in - it is not a public good, it still belongs to a group of people\n\n* don't discount the project as utopian. parts of this idea have been tried before, and chances are you can get a lucky break!\n\n* talk to churches - they own a bunch of buildings and could be very generous.\n\n* talk to [Le mouvement clanic in Brabant Wallon](https://clanic.org/le-mouvement-clanic/), founded by a hacker type lawyers (via Sophie); also, Sophie's sister works with green buildings\n\n## Artist Commons - how to build a stronger organisation around 3 community spaces?\n\nThey are an alternative to commercial art, residences, institutions. A non-hierarchical, membership based network, with 3 different spaces in Brussels and therefore 3 different models. The main challenges are two:\n\n1) Make the economics work to be able to cover the monthly rent.Administration and coordination is not the artists' thing (btw this we also learned in culture Culture Berlin).\n\n2) Get members to contribute more, make their projects into Artist Commons projects, and viceversa\n\nThe main feedback/ advice was:\n\n* a LOT of work has been done with incredibly little, thanks to a few dedicated people\n* have clear instructions (like a wiki) so that everyone knows exactly what to expect. Offer special memberships etc.\n* you need to decide who wants to build an organisation and make a focused team with a strategic plan and some investment (of time). Partnerships with institutions or longer term funders are not necessarily compromising your ethics.\n\n## What happens next and how you can get involved now, if you're reading this:\n\n- we are organising culture Culture Brussels #3 in September. Do you wish to help me organise it? Please leave a reply below.\n\n- Artist Commons would need ideas and support for writing funding proposals. It was recommended to get in touch with [Les comptoirs de ressources creatives](http://www.comptoirdesressourcescreatives.be/). Who can help with that?\n\n- Edgeryders is looking to recruit a local partnership builder for The Reef 2.0. Soon to be announced.

Instead, we use Wellbeing in Europe: this is our community narrative signaling interest in people's lived lives, their experiences and socio-economical contexts.

Innovation is also important, but one of the greatest values of a building is that we can keep it alive, and that is an important aspect of buildings being \u201cgreen\u201d.\n\n[...]\n\nModern \u201csensor and IoT equipped\u201d buildings can be a nightmare to maintain.\n\n[/quote]\n\n\nWooow, I totally love this approach!\n\nAbout this, I thought of something that was not in the list of questions, but should have (my fault! and am now throwing myself on @trythis's mercy for an answer). I worry that no one seems to know what happens to Portland concrete in the really long run. In some countries, like Serbia or Bulgaria, I have seen gigantic concrete apartment blocks that were built in the 1950s to 1970s as modern housing, but have degraded significantly over the decades. Even in central Belgrade I saw buildings that exhibited a kind of rot; they were obviously deemed too expensive to demolish or rejuvenate. So poorer and poorer people moved in: first professionals, then working class folks, then students, then squatters, then rats. Trees grow in the courtyards. Is this the destiny of all the concrete in the world?\n\nit comes together very nicely from the workshop, because armored concrete was also a modern and hip technology, stemming from materials innovation. And now we are looking at the gigatonnes of it we have poured and wonder what's going to happen to them...\n\n[quote=\"matthias, post:1, topic:11826\"]\n**Person-tracking IR heaters.** A version of the parabolic electric IR heaters mounted on a person-tracking pan-tilt head could be an interesting, low-powered way to keep people warm.\n[/quote]\n\nOr, more simple/cheaper/less brittle: have some \"warm spots\". For example, when I sit at my computer in the office I turn on an IR beam trained on me.

Its values of interoperability, privacy and decentralised power are foundational for an open web and the emergence of collective intelligence. It has credibility as a champion of the human-centric internet through its regulatory muscle flexing (the GDPR, Vestager, net neutrality). Now it has an important opportunity to take charge of also building technological solutions as well as new social and economic models that could support a human/community-centric alternative to compete with the dominant narrative of Big Tech and Venture funding. \n\nToday, the space of knowledge management and social/collective media applications is dominated by organisations that have an economic incentive to continuously grow-at-all-costs to reward investors. With these reward models organisations losing users or profit directly influences the profit margin of investors and create a need for 'infinite' growth. This incentivises the creation of lock-ins, as well as exploitation of the environment, workers and users. Data and social lock-ins limit innovation, open markets, the free flow of information and the capacity for collective intelligence. \n\nThe web in itself is decentralised and interoperable, but still severely centralised in the past 30 years. New decentralised technologies like Blockchain will not solve these issue on their own. To really create an open web and collective intelligence it is of crucial importance to simultaneously tackle the economic incentives, software development paradigms and methods of collaboration. Problems like trustworthy information sharing, problem solving and enhanced social inclusion are directly dependent on our society's capacity for collective intelligence.\n\nThe Next Generation Internet initiative, with its broad and ambitious scope, provides us with an incredibly powerful opportunity to shape new economic dynamics from the ground up, experiment with new approaches and provide boilerplate models that can be replicated across Europe and in other industries.  \n\nThe goal  for the WISDOM initiative is to grow a community of economically sustainable organisations that co-develop the technological, economical and social infrastructure for increasing the capacity for collective intelligence. \n\nWISDOM aims to do so by establishing an incubator program & co-development community for Open Source & P2P knowledge and collective intelligence tools using ethical business models & investor reward models with capped returns (like 'Steward Ownership'. See chapter 1.3.3) that give them the economic freedom to: \n\n- align themselves with the principles data portability & ownership, social interoperability, privacy, as well as human & community centric innovation\n- collaborate on shared infrastructure & research, and overcome the tragedy of the commons\n- act socially responsible by improving value chain sustainability and working conditions\n- sustainably grow together as a community/market, instead of growing-at-all-costs as individual organisations\n\nThe incubator members and its partners are world-class experts in individual, group and organisational facilitation using battle tested on-and offline methods to: \n\n- co-develop and articulate an ambitious vision for what we want the Next Generation Internet to be, involving diverse thought leaders and domain experts in the process\n- increase intra and inter organisational alignment and shared directions to avoid scattered deployment of funds\n- surface areas for co-development & co-research and increase impact of deployed NGI funds\n- increase sharing of industry specific knowledge, and peer-learning in organisational design & leadership\n\nThe consortium, its partners & supporter network bring together deep expertise about the internet and related technologies. Our varied backgrounds as entrepreneurs, data scientists, digital humanities experts, policymakers, activists and civil society actors allows us to take a multidisciplinary approach to developing this vision and its values. Our strong standing and experience as current partners in the NGI ensures we can rapidly build and iterate upon the exciting work we have already been doing in the past. \n\n## 1.1.2 Project objectives and key performance indicators\n\n### **Objective 1:**\n\nIncrease the web's capacity for collective intelligence through a holistic approach of supporting interoperability & human/community centric service design, sustainable investor reward models and business models, and facilitation methods to optimise for maximum cross-organisational collaboration.\n\n### **Objective 2:**\n\nGrow a value & purpose-aligned community of independently economically sustainable organisations that co-develop the technological, economical and social infrastructure for increasing the capacity for collective intelligence. \n\n### Objective 3:\n\nCreate a replicable boilerplate of technological concepts, open-source software modules, facilitation methods and economic reward models that can be used by other governments to kickstart local and national collective intelligence efforts, and show success metrics to convince the larger market to invest in these companies and ecosystems. \n\n### Objective 4:\n\nCreate an economic space with increase service competition and maximum potential for collaboration on shared infrastructure to solve the tragedy of the commons. \n\n# **1.2\tRelation to the work programme**\n\n*Indicate the work programme topic to which your proposal relates, and explain how your proposal addresses the specific challenge and scope of that topic, as set out in the work programme.*\n\n### \"Shape a more human-centric evolution of the Internet.\"\n\nTo **shape a more human-centric evolution of the Internet** it not only requires a focus on privacy and data ownership, but also to provide great services for individuals and groups. In the current server-client model powered by companies who's investor models incentivise growth-at-all costs, user data is centralised in a few big companies that offer the exact same services for billions of users. To generate this growth companies often rely on providing free/cheap services for users that then sell user data or advertisement in return, thus violating privacy and data ownership. \n\nTo retain this growth, organisations create lock-ins that reduce service innovation because users can't easily move to services that serve their needs better, and new service have troubles entering existing markets with innovative products. \n\nThe incubator focuses on organisations with investor rewards models that are not incentivising growth-at-all costs, like Steward Ownership, as well as software products that provide data portability and social interconnectivity. With the cohort of companies in the incubator we aim to grow a nucleus for a small economy of knowledge software products to recreate the free market dynamics that lead to the explosion of innovation and human/community centric services of the early web and early modern economy. \n\n### \"Promoting interoperability and strengthening the role of Europe in international standardisation\"\n\nIn the currently dominant reward models where investors make profits through the increase of speculative value, or get indefinite profit dividends by holding shares, every user or profit lost means less profit for investors. Interoperability however would make it possible that services loose users more easily, therefore those investor reward models strongly disincentivice interoperability and collaboration on shared infrastructure like standardisation efforts.\n\nTo promote interoperability it is important to not just develop interoperable products but change the investor rewards models too. \n\nThe incubator focuses on organisations with  investor rewards models where organisations can loose profits and users without reducing investor returns. This gives those organisations the economic freedom to be interoperable. With our strong focus on faciliating collaboration between the teams of the incubator we aim to increase co-development on shared infrastructure like standards or software modules. By having 10-20 successful organisations with potentially millions of combined users developing shared standards, it could lead to a strong role of Europe in driving the open and human centric development of international standardisation. \n\n### \"Service models for community services building on collective intelligence and novel approaches for connecting people and smart objects/agents to stimulate use of collective intelligence [...] develop new community-based service models on social networks that exploit collective intelligence to provide enhanced community services,\n\nThe lock-ins created by the services people use today, innovation on novel approaches to connecting people is heavily limited. Those lock-ins make it hard/impossible to migrate to other services, extend services with new technologies (like using different p2p protocols in the browser or messengers), or freely connect different people, services, devices and smart objects.\n\nBecause collective intelligence needs needs the free exchange of information, these lock-ins severely limit the potential for collective intelligence.\n\nThe incubator's concept of an open-source, interoperable, steward-owned economy is designed to incentivise innovation for human/community centric service models, enable the free flow of information and as a result the emergence of collective intelligence in the magnitude of the early web. \n\n### \"developing approaches for scientific understanding and technology-based stimulation of collective intelligence on social media and the internet to foster trustworthy knowledge and information sharing, and to enhance social inclusion. [...] Increase the availability of trustworthy content\n\nThe problem of a lack of trustworthy knowledge and increase in misinformation is not only about the availability of quality information, but people experiencing information overload. It takes time and skills to understand a topic or piece of content well enough to not be misinformed. So it is easy to be misinformed given the plethora of topics and facts people are exposed to today.\n\nHowever everyone is doing online research and gathers trustworthy knowledge useful to others. Due to the existing data and social lock-ins people can only share a fraction of the cognitive process, the quality content they read, background information they find or thoughts they have. If people could share a more complete picture of their subjective research and memory, they could help each other to find trustworthy information and understand more topics deeper, faster and with more perspectives.\n\nEvery person stores, processes and communicates such knowledge in different formats and apps. It is critical that applications helping users to sort, evaluate, curate and share this knowledge are adapted to the individuals workflows, provide algorithmic freedom and communicate with interoperable protocols. Creating such a diversity of services with a high degree of **social inclusion** can neither be achieved by a single company nor the current investor reward paradigms that incentivise organisations to build services with as many users as possible.\n\nTo solve this problem it is fundamental to have a human/community centric, interoperable network of many independent knowledge services that are highly adapted to individual's needs. To increase the availability of trustworthy content, users need flexibility to innovate on new models to  information through algorithmic freedom. \n\nAs described in the sections above, to achieve this kind of development and implementation of \"**new concepts for connecting people and smart objects/agents/AI on social media\"** it is required to change the economic incentives for organisations to enable the free flow of information and increase of service innovation. \n\nThe incubator's concept of an open-source, interoperable, steward-owned economy is designed **\"Generate new business opportunities and new Internet companies with maximum growth and impact chances.\"** to create the needed diversity of services. \n\nThe aim is to grow an initial nucleus of an economy where organisations have the maximum innovation, growth and impact chances as an interoperable ecosystem/market not as single internet companies. We believe it will be virtually impossible to grow a single ethical knowledge/social media organisations that can compete with Facebook/Google/Twitter, by trying to play the same winner-takes-all game. Even Google+, with $600m in funding, Google's network effects and financial resources failed. \n\n### Create a European blockchain ecosystem integrating research and innovation communities.\n\nThrough our network of community partners like IPFS, Dat, Ethereum and Holochain we are integrating international research and innovation communities in the advisory process. Their European community members are invited to apply with their blockchain based projects \n\nThe main focus of the incubator is more broadly P2P and offline-first applications, not only blockchains, as they are only one of many options in the P2P toolchain that can be used to achieve data ownership, privacy and interoperability. Using also requires careful consideration that is highly dependent on the specific use case. Only limiting applicants on blockchain based technologies would severely limit the opportunities for impact of this initiative and incubator. \n\nOne of the evaluation principles of the incubator is the degree of user centric adaptability that enables users/developers/entrepreneurs to experiment with different transport protocols to power communication and storage of applications outside of a single company's control. User centric adaptability also enables services to gradually migrate their infrastructure to blockchain technologies as they become more market ready. \n\n# 1.3. Concept:\n\nIn order to bring a large scale shift in society's capacity for collective intelligence & collaboration, it requires the simultaneous work on the technological, economical and social paradigms. The goal is to maximise collaboration on shared infrastructure, human/community-centric innovation and competition on services. \n\nWISDOM is an incubator program with a unique combination of principles capable of creating a human-centric European internet economy that becomes a fertile ground for collective intelligence and collaboration at scale. \n\nTo do so we combine the four elements of interoperability, open-source software, Steward Ownership economics and facilitation of individual, team and community growth.\n\n## 1.3.1. **Interoperability**\n\nThe incubator has a special focus on organisations that provide and add research on data portability, social interconnectivity and human/community-centric adaptability. Implemented correctly, it creates an environment where users can move to other services without frictions and still communicate with peers using other tools (Example: SMTP/email).\nHuman/community-centric adaptability enables users/developers experiment & upgrade to state-of-the-art technologies, protocols & data-models outside of a single service's control. (Example: Wordpress plugins). Users being able to adapt according to their needs creates a way for emergent interoperability & standardisation that is born out of the real world use cases of communication, instead of top-down standardisation. This adaptability could also express itself in the ability for users to get algorithmic freedom which can democratise people's ability to control their information diet and **foster trustworthy knowledge and information sharing**. \n\nSuch interoperability **creates an open market** with an increase in service competition & consumer choice on better and more ethical services. Interoperability also naturally limits the maximum individual growth of organisations because they will only be able to hold as many customers as they are the best services for. This creates external pressure for organisations to be service-oriented, not to dominate markets. Not even Google managed to overtake SMTP with Gmail.\n\nThe incubator is working together with leading individuals and organisations in the field, like IPFS, Dat, SSB community, W3C, [Hypothes.is](http://hypothes.is) and the NGI teams. \n\n## 1.3.2. Modular Open-Source-Software\n\nEnables developers to easily innovate on existing services without reinventing the wheel and thus more easily start profitable businesses and **increase service-competition & consumer-choice**. \n\nA modular development approach ensures that the developed components can be reused not only by the organisations funded by the incubator, but also in the larger ecosystem. The developed components also offer a great focal point for collaboration and the ability to drastically reduce development costs. \n\n## 1.3.3. Steward Ownership:\n\nSteward Ownership is an economic reward model for organisations that gives them economic freedom to be interoperable, service oriented and socially responsible, not to lock people in, exploit the environment or workers in order to grow-at-all-costs to reward investors.\n\nSteward Ownership companies cannot be sold on the open-market because of non-profit foundations that either fully own the company or have a golden share to veto a sale. People taking risk in investing time or money are rewarded with a capped profit share. These mechanisms remove greedy behaviour for growth-at-all costs while still incentivising growth and rewarding taking risks and entrepreneurial crafts. \n\nSteward Ownership companies' ability to be interoperable and socially responsible exists because the capped profit-share allows organisations to lose users/profits without lowering the total returns of investors. This also gives those organisations the economic freedom to be socially responsible so there is less need for regulation of bad actors that exploit users, employees or the environment because of unlimited profit interests.\n\nWith the current investor reward models, organisations often tend towards growing as fast as possible with free/cheap services where ads and exploiting user data are often the only remaining business models. \nSO organisations need to make profit in order to reward investors. It additionally creates incentivises for those companies to become good at providing human/community-centric services instead of growing-at-all-costs.\n\nInvented by Zeiss/Bosch, it is a model that exists for over 125 years and is used by companies like Mozilla, Ecosia, Buffer, Carlsberg & John Lewis. In Germany Steward Ownership organisations employ ~1.2 million people and in Denmark there are over 1000 SO companies which control a quarter of the 100 largest corporations. Historically SO organisations have a 600% higher survival rate and thus create a more stable economy.\nPromoting Steward Ownership structures is currently getting on the agenda of major funds and government's agends (CDU in Germany) and a shift away from a purely shareholder-value driven focus has entered the mainstream conversations, [like at the WEF](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/12/davos-manifesto-2020-the-universal-purpose-of-a-company-in-the-fourth-industrial-revolution/?fbclid=IwAR1G9FksiLdstX6G5CsQxJCbGqeqWeMaCkYNR9YUyKTz3FWkyDHG2s4Rhs4). \n\nInvesting in Steward Ownership organisations is also in the interest of the European Union because organisations that have been funded by the EU cannot be sold outside of the EU. It not only keeps the economic potential inside the EU, but also prevents the data of citizen being owned by other companies without their consent as part of an acquisition, like it recently happened with Fitbit's health data and the sale to Google. \n\n## 1.3.4. Facilitation:\n\nWe consider facilitation of individual growth, team governance and inter-organisational collaboration as an often underdeveloped, but crucial aspect of collective intelligence. \n\nIn order to have effective collaboration you need leaders and team members that possess emotional intelligence and shared purpose. \n\nArriving there inherently means working through frictions stemming from different expectations, goals and personality traits that requires careful facilitation by professionals, and education of people in the process. \nBy facilitating these interactions their is great gain to be made. \n\n- It allows to to uncover areas for potential collaboration on shared infrastructure like software modules and standards which can increase the impact of the funds deployed by NGI\n- it increases the shared direction & vision of the community and creates focus for the funds deployed by NGI\n- it increases the relationships and connections in the community\n- it increases social inclusion because facilitations integrate individual's needs\n\n## 1.3.5. An economy where it is more profitable to collaborate than to dominate\nWe believe the above mentioned 4 components create a positive feedback loop that fosters the emergence of an economy where: \n\n- it becomes **more profitable to collaborate than to dominate**\n- **the tragedy of the commons can be solved**\n- organisations mindset shifts from individually growing-at-all-costs to growing together as a community\n\nThis is because interoperable organisations need to focus on creating great services to a smaller audience (or lose them as customers) and therefore don't directly compete anymore against 90% of the market. As Steward Owned organisations they need to lower costs to return money to investors faster and thus have a financial incentive to collaborate with similar services on developing shared/public/open-source infrastructure (e.g. p2p modules or feature libraries like annotations). Since they can give away profits without lowering investor's total returns they can also be socially responsible by investing in public good infrastructure without profit interests. \n\nFacilitation in individual leadership, team management and inter-organisational collaboration can help increase the shared direction, uncover areas for co-development of infrastructure (software modules, data standards), create deeper relationships inside the community, and increase the impact of the funds deployed by H2020.", "created_at": "2019-12-04 19:47:53.528877", "updated_at": "2019-12-05 09:12:54.571338", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 3286, "wiki": false, "reads": 32, "score": 216.4, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 4, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [66896], "is_liked_by": [4, 4022, 4892], "is_private": false}, {"id": 48053, "user_id": 4654, "topic_id": 9061, "post_number": 43, "raw": "thanks it works now", "created_at": "2018-10-23 13:31:20.623314", "updated_at": "2018-10-23 13:32:35.393069", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 12.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [48040], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16214, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 3391, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Warm welcome</b>\n\nHi Mischa, my name is Noemi, good to meet you!\n\nIt seems competition and failing are not at all tabu to speak of anymore: last year some Edgeryders found themselves entering a prize competition with the unMonastery (hackers' residency space in South Italy), only to realize it's everyody's waste of time and clicks to vote for the project, and that <a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/hacking-grant-competitions-to-award-communities\">collaboration trumps competition</a> in terms of projects' efficiency and outcome. @Kira in Brussels is working on a project called <a href=\"/t/antiheroes/414\">ANTIHEROES</a> to equip individuals with tools to overcome failure, and in the process \"blamelessly talk about it\"..\n\nThese are the first two things coming to my mind when reading you, if you start browsing here or follow threads more will probably pop up.

Issue tracker plus coordinator\n\nIssue trackers have been developed for managing software development, esp. related to bugs (\u201cissues\u201d). Software development is basically always an exercise in distributed collaboration between software users and developers.\n\nIn addition, issue trackers work well for any well-defined task, especially purely technical tasks that change only products and documents but not people and their activities. It is also well suited to work truly globally across time zones, and to integrate people into a distributed team who come from a different culture and background.\n\nThis works because an \u201cissue\u201d should be a self-contained task that the assignee can work on without any further back-and-forth communication. For this to work, such issues should *not* be created by end users of a product who want to report a problem, because that results in unclear and incomplete reports and a lot of back and forth communication. Instead, a team leader (or rather: team coordinator) who is skilled in digital communication techniques and also knows the project or product very well should take on all this communication work for their team. It includes:\n\n* **Task coordination and time planning.** General project management which is the basis to then create feature request issues, their deadlines, and to assign them to developers.\n* **Issue descriptions.** Describing each issue in such a way that the developer can get it done without any follow-up questions. This is very different from how issue descriptions typically come in from users.\n* **Issue assignees.** Distributing the work between the developers, based on availability and skills.\n* **Issue deadlines.** These would depend on project work deadlines.\n* **Outward communication.** Or at least be the first to react to issue reports by users and other people inside the organization, taking off the mental load of error analysis from team members.\n* **Testing.** Once an issue is done, the bugfix or feature needs to be tested.\n* **Documentation.** Most developers hate to end user write documentation for their software, but the coordinator can take this on when there is time. Even a little documentation goes a long way.\n\nDoing this for a team of 5-8 people is already a full-time job \u2013 this is also the drawback of this technique: it just does not scale well. Also it is obvious that the team leader\u2019s task here is to serve their team members, making their workflow as smooth and friction-less as possible. Ideally, team members will have very little mental load with work coordination: when they finish one task, they will just pick the next task from the top of their list. They will also have very few interruptions, the exceptions being @mentions in the issue tracker and occasional instant messaging with the team coordinator. This allows them to focus and be productive in their work.\n\nIn an ideal organization, there would not have to be a team coordinator and instead everyone who needs something done that is to be managed with an issue tracker would follow the guidelines from above. However, that\u2019s asking for superhuman abilities: due to a lack of domain knowledge and due to a lack of long-term interest in the product, the average person just cannot care enough. Instead, choose the person as team coordinator who has the deepest expertise about a product and the deepest personal interest in its future, long-term development. You want a person interested in product quality and with a vision for the concerned product. Otherwise product development can quickly deteriorate into a messy assortment of quick fixes.\n\nWith respect to personal suitability, we found that structures people (\u201cpeople who love lists\u201d) who do not crave human interaction much are good candidates for using an issue tracker as their main \u201cinterface\u201d in a distributed organization. It can provide a well-structured, stress-free job of just working through the issue list, always picking the most pressing issue next. There are no calls or meetings to attend, so it is also very suitable for digital nomads.\n[/quote]\n\n@matthiasm I do not fully understand this. Are we using something like this in Edgeryders?

Is it something which can be re-used, re-factored or anyway re-injected into the system, in order to feed new realities being born?\n\nAlso, there's maybe something to learn in observing living organization manufacturing dead products (like <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1339536/Ghost-towns-China-Satellite-images-cities-lying-completely-deserted.html\">this</a>, as an extremely literal example).\n\nAgain, I'm totally unsure that such concepts might be on topic: they might be either too materialistic or too abstract (depending on the interpretation), or just too far from the main objective of the session.\n\nI just thought they could offer some useful insights, in contexts which are less commonly associated to the platonic idea of organization.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-12-25 02:51:13", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:20.101560", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 287, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [24788], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19287, "user_id": 2448, "topic_id": 5091, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Also no ticket</b>\n\nI am in the same situation, have no ticket, but from my previous experience it is no problem to get day tickets if you go in the morning.

Smart, hard working people tend to be better on all three (or n-) dimensions with respect to others. So, I very much share @Noemi 's point of view: when we meet an interesting person, we try to imagine a role for her, then try to create the conditions for us to be able to offer her that role. But, at the same time, the role is embedded in the\u00a0<em>project,</em>\u00a0not in the organisation. People can try their hand at roles, then maybe move on to different ones in the next project.\u00a0\n\nThis allows for some limited pairwise adjusting, too. I prefer pure research to\u00a0middle management roles, and I prefer middlie management to leadership. Still,\u00a0in many of my former projects\u00a0I had to lead, because no one else would do it (or could do it). I led reasonably well, with some mistakes, and I would do it again if I cared enought about the project.

I found [this piece by Cassie Robinson about the shortcomings of user centred design][ucd] useful when discussing this during the workshop\n\n[ucd]: https://medium.com/doteveryone/putting-users-first-is-not-the-answer-to-everything-dd05b9f11b5\n\n![moral-society-user-needs|621x270](upload://7WeF0fUS3FTYL8kamku1VUg546d.jpeg) \n\nI left knowing a bunch of things I didn't know when I walked into the workshop room.\n\n### What do you see as the single largest challenge to designing for climate in industry?\n\nThe key challenge I see is people feeling they have the (social) license to talk about the impacts of their work, and not being equipped to have discussions around this.\n\nIn my view, so many of the problems related to climate feel like they rely on people being prepared to say _\"I'm not comfortable with the consequences of doing that\"_.\n\nI think without people in senior positions create this culture where more junior staff feel supported, I think we'll end up the sad scenario where people continue to build services that end up pushing us closer to a economic and ecosystem collapse - the difference being that they know how far from sustainable these are, and still build them, but just feel _terrible_ about doing so, rather than changing their behaviour.\n\nWith that in mind, I think some of the [Consequence Scanning exercises from Doteveryone][cs], are really interesting - while they're not aimed at climate problems explicitly, they do help us have the same kind of conversations, in a relatively safe structured format.\n\n[cs]: https://doteveryone.org.uk/project/consequence-scanning/\n\n### What single thing would you want to see support available for, to help you with designing services as if we were in a climate emergency?\n\nSupport for professionals to develop this knowledge in the form of time for their own study, or an investment in training.\n\nI think this is necessary to help them build the capabilities to make informed decisions about what interventions they make when thinking through and designing services.\n\n### If there was one thing you\u2019d ask other practitioners to think about in your field after the workshop, what would it be?\n\nI think the key thing to think about that is just how we mistakenly act like there  is no cost to inaction, (the is a very real cost to inaction, and it's not distant any more), I think the conversations we have with people younger than us will be much, _much_ more awkward if we do nothing than the awkward conversations we might have now towards the end of 2019 with our peers.\n\nWe _have_ to get good at talking about climate, and while it's on us to educate ourselves, we don't need to wait til we're experts before we get to have opinions about this what what world we want to spend our professional time building.\n\nI found Mary Louise Heglar's article, [Home is always worth it][1] really good for helping me realise this.\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/service-design-in-a-climate-emergency-resources/12110\n\n\n[1]: https://medium.com/@maryheglar/home-is-always-worth-it-d2821634dcd9", "created_at": "2019-12-04 22:39:54.064275", "updated_at": "2020-12-14 17:15:48.767198", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 840, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 157.6, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [66936], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 4934, 8, 2915, 5528], "is_private": false}, {"id": 67112, "user_id": 2346, "topic_id": 11928, "post_number": 3, "raw": "So is the idea here that we can use any of the official EU languages, or that if possible we use at least English as a base-language (perhaps with other language additions)?", "created_at": "2019-12-06 18:21:51.663888", "updated_at": "2019-12-06 18:21:51.663888", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 33, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 6.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 70347, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 12674, "post_number": 1, "raw": "## Background\n\nBased on a conversation we had on Feb 6, as well as different conversations with @Zmorda and @BlackForestBoi , @hugi @MariaEuler  and I are exploring the following: How to shape our the work next year as setting foundations of a structured process for peer to peer incubation of mission-driven entrepreneurship. We depart from two things: A proposal for a collective intelligence incubator originally intended as an application for H2020 funding. As well our experience in setting up and running a first iteration of the OCI Lab. \n\nThe key challenges to figure out for this first iteration are:\n\n1. Fundraising outside institutions: Both the original proposal for the collective intelligence incubator and the OCI Lab have been reliant on institutions as a source of funding. Oliver is committed to do fundraising in the tech sector and I am happy to support/co-drive these efforts. .\n2. Incentives design: In the original proposal as well as in OCI Lab, there is a strong financial incentive for participants. Here, we would need to find a different engagement engine and drivers for people to participate during the period where we do not have money to offer any of the stakeholders.\n3. Curriculum building- We need to develop an effective l incubation methodology and curriculum that sits well with what Edgeryders does well.  OCI Lab is generating some interesting results, perhaps we can integrate some of it into a first run of the incubator. \n\nWe will develop, and test, the above through **a series of in person workshops**. Each workshop will be **preceded and followed up by online discussions and video chats** to prepare. The online discussion will take place on a dedicated area of the edgeryders platform with its own funnel in to simplify communication and engagement + onboarding. \n\n**The physical meetings and the online video discussion leading up to them are open to all but access-restriced.** In the sense that people who want to participate will be required to demonstrate that they have read up on the online documentation from previous phases of the process. \n\n## March 9-11, Stockholm: Strategy and planning \n\nMaria, Hugi, Zmorda and I will participate to look at how we can build synergies in the next 9 months between ongoing Edgeryders projects and these efforts.\n\n### Desired Outcomes of the meeting\n\n**Overview of the current ER Ecosystem**\n\n* What\u2019s happening within ER \u2013 overview & key elements of current projects\n* What are the strands and current focus areas\n* How are they relating to each other?\n\n**What: Defining the scope of our own work**\n\n* Presenting to each other, clarifying questions, seeing complementarities and inter-relations of the different NEW Ideas and Projects and EXISTING ones\n* Look also at Areas of ER and common ground\n\n**How (vision): Deepening ideas for each project/ line of work**\n\n* Starting with a first Brainstorm/Mapping of possible realisation pathways.\n  * Sustainable Resourcing and Viability:\n  * Offers and requests for ER community and/or Organisation\n  * If appropriate use a SBMC ([Social Business Model Canvas](https://bmtoolbox.net/tools/social-business-model-canvas/)) incl.\n    * Networks\n    * Beneficiaries\n    * Clients,\u2026.\n\n**How we work together**\n\n* How we support the individual and project needs?\n* Rhythm and Timeline\n* Communication Flows\n* Time engagement from everyone\n* Financial requirements and plan for resourcing\n* Task list per person\n* Open questions\n\n## Key points from meeting on February 6:\n\n**1. We need to be explicit about our individual objectives and drivers for our work. In order to better align the work we do together.**  A rough description to dig into in the March meeting.\n\n* **Hugi:**  Develop the ecosystem around blivande. He wants to focus on build work opportunities in Stockholm/Sweden. Internetdagarna is a good outlet for reaching a broad range of possible clients, funders and collaborators. Would like us to work as a team on internetdagarna interventions in such a way as to generate and follow up on business leads.\n* **Maria:**  Design and drive a process with a tangible output. Outside of ER she is currently working on projects to get corporates to engage people in design practice with a final exhibition where they will present their work and multiple science communication projects.\n* **Nadia:**  See a situation where 1) people come in at one end and come out at the other having defined a concept, found their people and completed an MVP 2) Translate lessons learned into demand for the scifi economics lab work amongst political/institutional and business leaders. As much for NGI as for POPREBEL.\n \n**2. The work with the Webkit needs a revenue generation strategy and dedicated team to pursue it.**  Perhaps also graphryder/edgesense. E.g if we are thinking thinking a SAAS venture (which includes training as revenue generator) then that is a totally different route than say pursuing a strategy where it is the \u201ccheap and fast\u201d generator of business leads for larger consulting or research gigs. And we need a process to help us figure this out\u2026 I feel like we are out of our depth. So where to go from here?\n\n**3. Lessons learned from last year**\n\n* Festival: Having many very different things happening at the same time in different places spreads attention. Moving forward it make sense to cluster events around themes, or around geography, and work more sequentially. Also, in the case of MENA based events, we found that events that are centred on helping drive a specific project forward, e.g developing the AI engine for a sea turtle rescue NGI, generated better results. There is a need for designing a framing, structure, process, language and materials (curriculum of the collective intelligence incubator) that makes participation meaningful and easier.\n* Community engagement: In a parallel development Maria is testing an approach where calls are centred around helping an individual community member to develop their idea or project. E.G Erik Lonroths mission to get open source into the swedish teaching curriculum. People show up to help him figure stuff out.\n* Content management: There is quite some copy rot in the NGI Forward and POPREBEL category intro texts, category structure etc. on the [edgeryders.eu](http://edgeryders.eu/) platform.

While companies and organisations have put a stall on hiring, projects still have to be completed and the number of contract positions has expanded considerably over recent months.\n\n[Research](https://www.forbes.com/sites/elainepofeldt/2020/09/29/pandemic-fuels-a-freelancing-boom/#7d77cfab6625) carried out by a major jobs platform shows that freelancers account for 36% of the US workforce, while 12% of the country\u2019s entire workforce began freelancing throughout the pandemic.\n\nIt\u2019s not just unique to The States, in Europe and Asia the number of workers entering the gig economy has been growing since 2008 - and it\u2019s likely that trend has accelerated over the past few months.\n\nAt Edgeryders, we think it\u2019s important to discuss and find solutions to some of the issues facing freelancers, as the working world changes.\n\nThe current pandemic has really illustrated how challenging it is for people to work remotely - including contract workers - while also trying to take care of their children. We think we can find a better solution to how both can work together, so we are running an event on Wednesday 21st October for some open discussion.\n\nWe want employers, remote workers, freelancers and those in the coworking space to join the webinar as we facilitate an unbiased conversation on how child care currently looks and how it could be improved. Comment [here](https://tell.edgeryders.eu/14568) to join that conversation.\n\nOne of the reasons there has been a huge increase in freelance work is because so many technologies have emerged in recent times to accommodate it. Freelancers are finding it continuously easier to get work online, while high-speed internet means location is no longer an issue - people can work from anywhere.\n\nAt Edgeryders, we are running an event on Thursday 22nd October, with an expert panel, to discuss how new technologies can help and hinder freelance workers. If this is something that is of interest to you, please comment [here](https://tell.edgeryders.eu/14495).\n\n**That\u2019s not just all of what we are discussing...**\n\nAt Edgeryders we have been examining lots of issues over the past four months. From privacy concerns to how we can pave our way out of the economic fallout in a more sustainable way, our members have been exploring endless possibilities. If you\u2019re interested in learning more, some of our most recent ethnography findings are summarised [here](https://tell.edgeryders.eu/14614).\n\n**Don\u2019t forget\u2026**\n\nAnother of our upcoming events:\n\n* 30/10: [How can we work together to support localisation of food? ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/draft-event-invitation-sustainable-agriculture-and-food/14493) A webinar to learn about opportunities in the EU and beyond.\n\n*This newsletter is part of the NGI Forward project Generation Internet (NGI) initiative, launched by the European Commission in the autumn of 2016.

In many ways this year has become that of the \u2018unplannable\u2019.\n\nWith countries experiencing a second wave of coronavirus cases, no one can really say what the next five months may hold. Just like 2008 and the years thereafter, everything that lies ahead is uncertain.\n\nAt Edgeryders we have always believed there is strength in the collective and the journeys our members take together can help pave a way out of this unwieldy time.\n\nOn 21st July, we are holding [an event](https://edgeryders.eu/t/how-to-support-recovery-of-the-coworking-sector-an-online-summit-bringing-together-key-industry-figures-and-wider-sector-participants/13987) to discuss how the coworking sector can recover from the economic fallout of the pandemic. We have invited seven experts from all over the world who will be discussing their experiences and exploring the solutions on how they can begin to form a new route.\n\nFor inspiration ahead of the event, our co-founder [Nadia has shared her own path](https://edgeryders.eu/t/my-own-path-to-working-with-others-on-the-internet-and-what-i-hope-to-explore-with-others-during-this-event/14041) and how she came to found an organisation that has created digital tools for distributed co-creation and virtual coworking rooms.\n\nUniversities have also been hit hard by the crisis. In many ways they were an already broken system prior to the pandemic, with researchers and academics faced with unpredictability, a lack of job security, and a system with inbuilt inequality and biases.\n\nWe have previously talked about precarity in this sector at Edgeryders, but a new conversation has ignited around it specifically in relation to [German universities](https://edgeryders.eu/t/who-and-what-is-the-university-of-the-21st-century-for-breaking-through-neoliberal-agendas/13986/7), as our members imagine new ways in which universities can be funded and operate.\n\nOur community has also been discussing a route that many countries have taken in recent months to try and stop the spread of the virus - tracing apps. Our members are mostly in agreement that this road is misguided and such apps infringe on people\u2019s liberties and basic human rights.\n\nThe conversation [resumed](https://edgeryders.eu/t/a-surveillance-pandemic-results-of-the-community-listening-post-on-risks-for-freedom-in-the-wake-of-covid-19/13183/46) this week when one of our members raised questions over recent research that has found that in the Asia-Pacific region states that are inclined towards authoritarianism increased surveillance throughout the pandemic.\n\nOne of our members has previously posted about the contract-tracing app that is being used in Germany and asks, why people have not been more critical of it. If you have thoughts on an alternative path to take, [join the conversation](https://edgeryders.eu/t/germany-introduces-corona-virus-tracing-app-why-arent-people-more-sceptical/13906/10).\n\nSpeaking about creating different routes, our members have also been discussing the details of how a new internet could be developed - [one that\u2019s open source and free of big tech interest](https://edgeryders.eu/t/how-do-we-organize-society-for-a-whole-systems-approach-for-developing-the-internet/9766).\n\n---", "created_at": "2020-07-10 14:30:51.068555", "updated_at": "2020-07-14 11:31:04.953507", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 609, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 173.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 80236, "user_id": 6455, "topic_id": 14063, "post_number": 2, "raw": "ping @kajafarszky", "created_at": "2020-07-10 14:31:08.986713", "updated_at": "2020-07-10 14:31:08.986713", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 22.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5667], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3954, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 3921, "post_number": 1, "raw": "So I just finished the <a href=\"/t/open-ethnographer-software-design/3905\">software design for Open Ethnographer</a>.

It will be based on eComma, which is great find: an open source \"commentary machine\" module for Drupal, just recently released. This is how eComma looks right now:\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/393faa42310aa96b8b43a598aa3c72dc00b58597.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"401\"><br>\n\nAnd here's the rest of the sneak preview \u2013 no screencasts, sorry, you have to invest some imagination:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Look through the <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/ecomma\">eComma mini-manual</a> (section \"User Manual\").</li>\n\n<li>Then try the <a href=\"http://www.coerll.utexas.edu/ecomma/demo\">eComma live demo</a> yourself. Tagging does not work there as you have no login, but that does not matter as we'll do it a bit differently anyway:</li>\n\n<li>Try out the <a href=\"http://annotatorjs.org/\">Annotator live demo</a> to see how tagging will work. Just select some text and click the button that appears. Tag selection and some other stuff will be differently though, so:</li>\n\n<li>Finally, read through the <a href=\"/en/open-ethnographer/open-ethnographer-project-plan#implementation\">implementation tasks</a> to get an idea of how we will extend the eComma software to be also a code manager and coder for open ethnography. By making it both, we will share the maintenance effort with the eComma developers. Beauty of open source! <img alt=\"enlightened\" height=\"23\" src=\"/profiles/commons/libraries/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/lightbulb.png\" title=\"enlightened\" width=\"23\">\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nDid you get the idea? Do you have feedback or criticism for the basic architecture and feature set?

Razveden sam bez dece. Trenutno sam nezaposlen. Ja sam zavr\u0161io \u0161kolu za elektromehani\u010dara. U \u017eivotu sam se bavio svime i sva\u010dime osim nezakonitih stvari, uvek sam bio dobrica :) elem nikada se nisam bavio strukom koju sam zavr\u0161io, ja to ne znam da radim, ja to ne volim. Sada bi me neko pitao za\u0161to sam to upisao ako ne volim, razlog je jednostavan, dopalo mi se ime smera, samo sam toliko znao, potpuno sam bio ne informisan o mom smeru i \u010dime bih se ja u \u017eivotu bavio kada zavr\u0161im tu \u0161kolu. Potpuno sam bio ne informisan o mogu\u0107nostima, dete od 15 godina je previ\u0161e mlado da bi samo odlu\u010divalo o tome od \u010dega \u017eeli da \u017eivi kada odraste, potrebna je svaka pomo\u0107 i informacija. To je jedna od stvari koje jako nedostaju u gradu, treba se mnogo vi\u0161e baviti decom, da kroz neke radionice deca sami rade, da se upoznaju sa poslovima, ma\u0161inama, da osete taj posao i onda odlu\u010de \u0161ta vole, a \u0161ta ne. Nezaposlen sam zato \u0161to u gradu nisam na\u0161ao posao koji odgovara meni i mom nemirnom avanturisti\u010dkom duhu, nikada nisam mogao da radim pored ma\u0161ine i vijam neke norme. Kreativan sam, dobro se slu\u017eim re\u010dima, nekada davno sam pisao pesme za svoju du\u0161u. Komunikativan sam, dru\u0161tven, pored srpskog govorim jo\u0161 madjarski i engleski. Uvek nasmejan i optinista. Obo\u017eavam svoju zemlju i svoj grad, ali uskoro \u0107u opet za inostranstvo, razlog mog odlaska je osim ekonomske prirode i taj da nam je grad povu\u010den i bez dogadjaja, siv, optimista sam, i sa vremena na vreme se vratim u nadi da je situacija bolja, shvatim da nije i opet odem a du\u0161a se kida. Obo\u017eavam da provodim vreme u prirodi, u \u0161umi, na planini, to mi je melem za du\u0161u. Imam jako izra\u017een ose\u0107aj empatije i razumevanja za sve ljude, obo\u017eavam \u017eivotinje. Najbolji poslovi koje sam u \u017eivotu radio su kada sam radio u azilu za napu\u0161tene \u017eivotinje, i kada sam radio kao li\u010dni negovatelj jednom momku koji boluje od cerebralne paralize.\nIsto bih voleo da pohvalim Tatjaninu ideju i da iznesem neka svoja mi\u0161ljenja i zapa\u017eanja. Tatjana je spomenula neke slu\u010dajno ili namerno zaboravljene vrednosti. Apsolutno podr\u017eavam njene ideje za radionicu. Moje shvatanje celog problema je malo \u0161ire i dublje. Kao prvo ako \u017eelimo budu\u0107nost, mi moramo ulagati u budu\u0107nost. Na\u0161a deca su na\u0161a budu\u0107nost, a mi njih moramo bukvalno otimati od rijaliti programa, kompjuterskih igrica, novokomponovane muzike... Zato \u0161to imamo decu koja su ponosna na to \u0161to su uspeli da zavr\u0161e \u0161kolu a da nisu pro\u010ditali nijednu lektiru. Pored radionica kreativnog pisanja ja bih jo\u0161 uvrstio i de\u010dije knji\u017eevne ve\u010deri, uz upoznavanje de\u010dijih pisaca, mo\u017eda nekog de\u010dijeg glumca koji bi \u010ditao odlomke knjige, i naravno da sve bude interaktivno da i deca u tome u\u010destvuju. Da bi se smanjilo vr\u0161nja\u010dko nasilje, i kompleksi ni\u017ee vrednosti medju decom trebalo bi smisliti dru\u017eenja i edukativne zabave, \u010dajanke nedeljom poslepodne gde bi mogle da se igraju dru\u0161tvene igre, ili da se pogleda neka edukativna emisija, ili neki film, a posle da se diskutuje da deca budu \u0161to aktivnija u izno\u0161enju svog mi\u0161ljenja. Organizovati debatne ve\u010deri gde bi u\u010destvovala deca, da nau\u010de da budu parlamentarni, da se argumentima bore za svoje stavove. Da se organizuju volonterski kampovi i akcije tokom cele godine. Tokom zime prikupljanje priloga, igra\u010daka, slatki\u0161a i ode\u0107e da bi i deca \u010diji roditelji nemaju materijalna sredstva dobila novogodi\u0161nji paketi\u0107, u saradnji sa socijalnom slu\u017ebom koja ima spisak socijalno ugro\u017eenih porodica. Preko leta da se prave kampovi pod \u0161atorima u nekom be\u010dejskom parku gde bi uz kreativne radionice deca organizovano \u010distila otpatke pored reke, u \u0161umi, parku, kre\u010denje grafita... Posle ovog smo otprilike na nivou osmog razreda. Dobili bismo to da bi se deca upoznala rano (otprilike prvi razred), u\u010destvovala u raznim aktivnostima, vezali bi se jedno za drugo. Ne bi provodili ceo dan u ku\u0107i uz televizor ili ra\u010dunar. Kroz razne akcije bi se nau\u010dili empatiji. Ne bi bilo usamljene dece. U osmom razredu pa do kraja \u0161kolovanja bi trebalo omogu\u0107iti radionice gde bi deca videla \u0161ta zaista \u017eele i vole. Trebalo bi nabaviti male CNC ma\u0161ine, laser za graviranje, 3d printer, \u0161iva\u0107u ma\u0161inu...cilj je da deca ne upisuju srednju \u0161kolu a da ne znaju u stvari \u010dime \u0107e se baviti kada zavr\u0161e \u0161kolu. Da mogu da isprobaju ma\u0161ine koje su im interesantne, da razmenjuju mi\u0161ljenje sa drugom decom koja imaju ista interesovanja. Mogla bi se napraviti mala manufaktura, da se prave neki unikatni predmeti na 3d \u0161tampa\u010du, gravirati unikatni privesci laserom ili na cnc ma\u0161ini, to bi moglo da se prodaje i od toga da se plate teku\u0107i tro\u0161kovi, put na takmi\u010denja, izleti... . Cilj je spojiti ljude koji imaju iste sfere interesovanja. Rodila bi se nova partnerstva, kumstva... Time bi se videlo \u0161ta je deci interesantno, \u0161ta oni \u017eele, a ne \u0161ta im se silom natura. A samim time bi se videlo kakva industrija nedostaje Be\u010deju, a otvaranjem iste bismo dobili to da se ljudi ne bi iseljavali, ve\u0107 ostajali i doseljavali u na\u0161 grad. Stvorili bi smo zdravije dru\u0161tvo i zdravije radno okru\u017eenje u gradu.", "created_at": "2019-12-04 18:21:35.859625", "updated_at": "2019-12-04 19:24:38.867882", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 855, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 42.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3206, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30353, "user_id": 1673, "topic_id": 2362, "post_number": 21, "raw": "<b>Sintra</b>\n\nHi, Dorotea, Hi All,\n\nI'm all for Sintra (full disclosure: I live in Lisbon so it's a 5 min walk), and Sintra qualifies for an EdgeRetreat like no other: It is a romantic place and it is situated on the very Edge of Europe!\n\nOctober is fine.

The high rate of\nunemployment in the region (approx. 51% unemployment rate among graduates\nwho lack the necessary skills and qualifications for the job market) was\none of the reasons OMV initiated and funded a community development\nproject.\n\u201cSkills to Succeed (STS)\u201d was implemented between 2012 and 2017 by\nHilfswerk Austria International, one of Austria\u2019s leading organizations for\ndevelopment cooperation and humanitarian aid.\nThe project has been showcased through vocational training, economic\ndevelopment initiatives and civil society capacity building programs aiming\nto boost employability and income generation through targeted training and\nbusiness/economic development platforms.\n*Employment Overview:*\nIn Tataouine,  tremendous social pressure has been placed on the government\nto create more jobs in the region. However, unemployment in Tataouine is\nlargely an issue of search frictions. It is not a lack of jobs, but rather\na mismatch between labor market entrant expectations and firm needs that\ncause persistent unemployment. University Graduates expect wage and benefit\npackages that are not in consort with the realities of the jobs being\ncreated by the private sector. This lack of being able to find \u2018suitable\u2019\nemployment leads to long unemployment spells upon labour market entry.\nYoung university graduates in Tataouine have been particularly hurt by the\ncurrent deterioration in job creation in the local economy. School and work\ninstitutions remain unconnected, implying that often the technical training\nmay not be closely related to the skills needed by employers. Gender\ndifferences among young job seekers are important in the region. Young\nwomen are less likely to be employed than men with equal educational\nattainment. In 2015, among young men in Tataouine, graduates have a high\nrate of unemployment (20.74%). The level of unemployment among women\ngraduates suggests that females are more likely to be without a job\n(51.77%).\n* A more market-oriented approach to training that allows employers to\nshape the training they need with financial support from the government is\nrequired.\nMajor institutional changes in labor markets will be needed to increase the\nemployability of young workers in Tataouine. Young university graduates\ninterviewed emphasized that the new governmental program \u201cDignity\nContract\u201d, a contract that is expected to allow 1042 unemployed university\ngraduates from Tataouine to be trained in companies for two years and to\nreceive a monthly salary of 600 Tunisian dinars (200 dinars paid by\ncompanies and 400 by the State), is not an effective policy to create good\njobs, especially for women. There is a lack in the number of\nwell-structured companies able to absorb new applicants. Consequently,\nmajor imbalances between the number of job openings and job seekers are\nexpected. In the short term improving the prospects for good jobs will\ndepend on changing the existing institutional arrangements that reach a\nvery small number of beneficiaries.\n\n*Entrepreneurship Environment: *\n\nFor entrepreneurship to translate into job creation in Tataouine, creating\nan environment in which entrepreneurs is a must. According to a local\nsurvey recently conducted online by Skills to Succeed program, 88% of 200\npeople polled between the ages of 20 and 35 indicated a desire to create\ntheir own start-ups. However, these startups can only thrive in an\necosystem conducive to their needs. Developing the proper entrepreneurial\necosystem must engage a wide range of stakeholders, including private\nsector companies, government ministries, civil society and financial\ninstitutions. The role of each actor must be assessed to determine his or\nher capacity to improve the entrepreneurial environment. Furthermore, these\nstakeholders must meet to discuss and debate how to increase the success\nrate of entrepreneurs in Tataouine.\nThe challenges are not unfamiliar: access to financing, inflexible lending\npolicies, bureaucratic hurdles, high level of risk, inevitable time delays,\nlack of mentoring and access to talent and access to markets.\nThus, the local economy has continued to suffer from structural fragilities\nand weaknesses. Firstly, the economic structure of the region is highly\ndependent on external revenue sources (e.g. Informal Businesses, Seasonal\nTourism, and Transfers from local citizens living abroad) which make the\neconomic performances highly vulnerable to external shocks and consequently\nunsustainable in the long term. Secondly, while the prospects of public\nsector employment have declined significantly in recent years, employment\nopportunities in the formal private sector have remained limited.", "created_at": "2017-08-27 17:58:37", "updated_at": "2017-08-27 18:02:34.612307", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 757, "wiki": false, "reads": 23, "score": 14.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [34835], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 46943, "user_id": 3826, "topic_id": 8967, "post_number": 5, "raw": "@noemi you are welcome to join next time...

For both me and @anon82932460 this will make it much easier to create campaigns which have the desired results. For me in terms of texts and editorials, for Filip in terms of who to target online. \n\nHere's an example I made two years ago for a \"green blockchain\" startup, sharing it as an example:\n\n![25|690x568](upload://Aln7ybs3tpRe3eAqIQDXXGD3m43.png) \n\nSo, ideally, we have - per project - 6 (six) personas, which means 12 (twelve) in total. \n\nWe'd need to answer these questions:\n\n* Location\n* Age\n* Income\n* Job title\n* Challenges\n* Hobbies & Interests \n* what do they read\n* who is their community - where do they feel home \n* Priorities\n* Family\n* what they like about Edgeryders\n* Language\n* STORY\n* Social media activity\n\nA little while ago I created a list of Facebook pages I imagined would be interesting to Edgeryders overall, but this differs per project, and I think re POPREBEL - since we're really trying to target outside of our own bubbles - this is significantly different. But anyway, for inspiration (and perhaps useful tool). The numbers behind it are the FB id's, meaning that if you'd type in facebook.com you can add the number behind it and it takes you to that page.\n\n> Targeting:\n> \n> Freelancers, artists, free-minded people, activists, future-oriented, techies. \n> \n> People who believe the state cannot/willnot/isnot provide a pension plan/elderly care worthy \n> People who will be affected by the lack of elderly care\n> \n> \n> Resident of:\n> \n> Czechia\n> Poland\n> Serbia\n> \n> \n> Has been to/Likes:\n> \n> Christiana \n> https://www.facebook.com/pages/Christiana-Copenhagen/1307140192696442\n> https://www.facebook.com/pages/Freetown-Christiania/108104659217600\n> https://www.facebook.com/places/Things-to-do-in-Christiania-Kobenhavn-Denmark/100246513350977/\n> \n> \n> Likes Pages:\n> \n> GENERAL\n> wired\t\t\t\t19440638720\t\n> verge\t\t\t\t193742123995472\n> Edgeryders\t\t\t290379807658377\t\t\n> fuckupnights\t\t\t121578058031288\n> upwork\t\t\t698360806920942\n> fansoffreelancer\t\t353386506511\n> ImpactHubGlobal\t\t394823610574611\n> \n> \n> POLAND\n> outrid3rs\t\t\t1226182820808696\n> InstytutAdamaMickiewicza\t132249453484007\n> wachlarzpl\t\t\t1462105517420650\n> grynaszstudio\t\t\t226778220816736\n> zakladmakerspace\t\t614172775323585\n> pracowniamiejska\t\t1419844174938785\n> SDNPoland\t\t\t237763239681763\n> portalkomunalny\t\t629635557163835\n> cikpoznan\t\t\t141620009240246\n> miejscespotkan\t\t249296008586784\n> funkrk\t\t\t\t790358937730315 (fuck up nights Krakow)\n> FUN.Trojmiasto\t\t323885291141245 (Gdanks)\n> FUN.Warszawa\t\t421836684634332\n> FUNPoznan\t\t\t1427254490918509\n> \n> \n> \n> SERBIA\n> fondb92\t\t\t150960415003837\n> kcgrad\t\t\t\t357294840726\n> Praksa-Makerspace-Belgrade\t905875172768264\n> Diri\u017eabl\t\t\t654290577999586\n> artspacekvaka22\t\t1495956874067483\n> kvartum\t\t\t357085351082471\n> fmkdigitalart\t\t\t302781923147550\n> OKKTV\t\t\t252175131914234\n> protobgd\t\t\t163506170473909\n> seecult\t\t\t\t153604421331891\n> umetnobil\t\t\t929939480456709\n> EugsterBelgrade\t\t1765969073636338\n> HaklabBeograd\t\t340968655938812\n> RailsGirlsBeograd\t\t641928042500594\n> jsbelgrade\t\t\t661163417352352\n> ubuntusrbija\t\t\t173032179422872\n> \n> \n> \n> CZECHIA\n> FUNprague\t\t\t537567503040806\t\n> PrusaLab\t\t\t353598318439891\n> fablabbrno\t\t\t611307922387297\n> impacthubbrno\t\t560389974056740\n> Prototypbrno\t\t\t604608026289060\n> futlab.cc\t\t\t1313802525386693\n> CentrumDruku3d\t\t176589912511120\n> impacthubpraha\t\t158158938269\n> CestaUspesnych\t\t635771569832591\n> artsmanagement\t\t161035855771\n> storyTLRS\t\t\t898156036915278\n> vzletna\t\t\t\t688074548203952\n> PONK.space\t\t\t378087869267980\n> 2ndhandedflowers\t\t1884419095146628\n> textile.mountain\t\t319946128814879\n> czechzerowaste\t\t533021720195213\n> \n> \n> \n> TECH:\n> \n> PrusaLab\t\t\t353598318439891\n> fablabbrno\t\t\t611307922387297\n> impacthubbrno\t\t560389974056740\n> Prototypbrno\t\t\t604608026289060\n> futlab.cc\t\t\t1313802525386693\n> CentrumDruku3d\t\t176589912511120\n> impacthubpraha\t\t158158938269\n> fondb92\t\t\t150960415003837\n> kcgrad\t\t\t\t357294840726\n> Praksa-Makerspace-Belgrade\t905875172768264\n> EugsterBelgrade\t\t1765969073636338\n> HaklabBeograd\t\t340968655938812\n> RailsGirlsBeograd\t\t641928042500594\n> jsbelgrade\t\t\t661163417352352\n> ubuntusrbija\t\t\t173032179422872\n> zakladmakerspace\t\t614172775323585\n> pracowniamiejska\t\t1419844174938785\n> SDNPoland\t\t\t237763239681763\n> \n> \n> SOCIAL:\n> 2ndhandedflowers\t\t1884419095146628\n> textile.mountain\t\t319946128814879\n> czechzerowaste\t\t533021720195213\n> OKKTV\t\t\t252175131914234\n> funkrk\t\t\t\t790358937730315 (fuck up nights Krakow)\n> FUN.Trojmiasto\t\t323885291141245 (Gdanks)\n> FUN.Warszawa\t\t421836684634332\n> FUNPoznan\t\t\t1427254490918509\n> outrid3rs\t\t\t1226182820808696\n> portalkomunalny\t\t629635557163835\n> cikpoznan\t\t\t141620009240246\n> miejscespotkan\t\t249296008586784\n> \n> \n> ARTS:\n> artspacekvaka22\t\t1495956874067483\n> kvartum\t\t\t357085351082471\n> fmkdigitalart\t\t\t302781923147550\n> OKKTV\t\t\t252175131914234\n> protobgd\t\t\t163506170473909\n> seecult\t\t\t\t153604421331891\n> CestaUspesnych\t\t635771569832591\n> artsmanagement\t\t161035855771\n> storyTLRS\t\t\t898156036915278\n> vzletna\t\t\t\t688074548203952\n> InstytutAdamaMickiewicza\t132249453484007\n> wachlarzpl\t\t\t1462105517420650\n> grynaszstudio\t\t\t226778220816736\n> \n> \n> \n> Occupation:\n> \n> Freelancer (?)\n> \n> Artist\n> Journalist/Blogger\n> Programmer\n> Developer\n> Graphic Designer\n\n**AND NOW THE IMPORTANT STUFF**\n\ndear people in the projects, this is what I'd need from you:\n\nAnything, anything, that you can think of is important to the target audience that YOU have in mind for the project, share it here in the comments.

Or do they prefer that Dioniso can use the shop just as any other, fully mobile, person? Both solutions have advantages on paper: pressing the call button means \"my mobility is reduced, please help me out\", and that is somehow the beginning of a relationship.

Ideally you would use a well established community routine to convene people you want to meet, in a live/ VOIP conversation. As a community mobilizer it saves time in having one on one calls by simply inviting people you want to introduce to edgeryders at a wednesday call.\n\nFrom these past months I'm happy to report the weekly calls have been the heartbeat of collectively organising the OpenVillage festival, and a plus. It helped onboarding new people and offering more members the opportunity to get involved in daily work and be seen as new talent around. \n\n> \"We kept to a weekly schedule with the calls. It made sure nobody wandered off too much and kept a rhythm in the work for everyone to latch on to.\" (regular participant)\n\nI can run over our usual process with whoever is interested.\nSoo, anyone jumping the ship? Ping @zmorda @hazem @Yosser @johncoate. Also @asimong if you want to start the restorative health practices - this is a way to test waters. Also @alex_levene if you want to seed your storytelling line of work in edgeryders? \n\nI recommend having 1 person responsible, even if more hosts are signed up to lead, facilitate themed community calls.

So, for example, there is a subcommunity around Tudor. It formed like this: first he commented Rossella Bargiacchi's great\u00a0<a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/share-your-ryde/mission_case/sharpest-edge\">Sharpest Edge mission report</a> - still during the testing phase, and she replied. Then he left <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/share-your-ryde/mission_case/postcard-future#comment-23\">a comment</a> to Alberto MZ's Pstcard from the future report; JulienC commented him back, and he replied. These are just two of many interactions that happened in Edgeryders, resulting into a subcommunity - because these three users did not comment or were commented by any users other than members of the team.\u00a0\n\nNow, the question I am asking is this: is there a reason for the \"grouping\" of users into subcommunities? Or is it randomness? Randomness is unlikely, because the modularity value tells us the structure we see is unlikely to emerge from random interaction, but still possible - I don't want to overstate this. However, if several people look at this and say \"hey, but those communities are clearly identifiable as people discussing sets of topics!\" then you are starting to have an improbable structure that fits well into a certain explanation: still not a \"fact\", but worth looking into.\n\nThanks to you all - I now have four completed questionnaires.

Comments can be read, posted, edited, and replied to on the Plato platform, but they are defacto topics and posts on a Discourse platform. We are building Plato specifically so that we can use the Edgeryders Discourse as a comment engine, relying on the Discourse API.\n\nThis means that if we were to develop Plato as a part of the Edgeryders offer, we would have a tool for working with participatory city development that also has a layer of ethnography and SSNA built in.\n\nFor an example of how Plato works in a similar way to Decidim, [see this proposal for an art gallery exhibition at Blivande](https://dreams.blivande.com/gallery/5fbcc026564bcb00217a67e5). In particular, note the comment thread and the way issues are worked through as the project is iterated to meet the guidelines.

Here's the plugin in question:\nhttps://github.com/gdpelican/discourse-graphryder\n\nI've put in some error handling so that it has a low risk of crashing anything once it gets set up.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, it will start auto-syncing changes to the DB automatically. In order to do a full import of things already in the database, you can either set the GRAPHRYDER_IMPORT env variable on startup:\n```\nGRAPHRYDER_IMPORT=1 rails s\n```\nor run the importer manually in console:\n```ruby\n> Graphryder::Importer.initialize!\n```\nThat should output something like this:\n![|690x178](upload://vclt8gGkbymi1Pn9gnZefDDGK4s.png) \n\nIf some queries fail, they'll pop output into the console without killing anything else:\n![|690x51](upload://rDaWU332uNm1RcZe8ivi1g8t1UO.png)\n\nNB that the first time the plugin runs, it will attempt to install the RedisGraph module onto the Discourse redis instance; I haven't had trouble with this in the past installing on a local instance, but haven't run it through the `launcher rebuild app` install process before.\n\nThis will expose an endpoint, `/graphryder/query`, which should be accessible to API keys which either have site admin access, or are members of an `annotator` group.\n\nI make no guarantees about the robustness of the graph, or the endpoint returning values from the graph just yet, although simple queries like\n```\nMATCH (post:post) RETURN post, count(*) as count\n```\nseem to be going through okay. It would be possible at this point to b0rk the RedisGraph db via this endpoint if you wanted to, although nothing a re-import using the above commands couldn't fix.\n\nHere's an example curl to try out:\n```\ncurl -X POST http://<instance>/graphryder/query -d '{\"query\": \"MATCH (u:user) RETURN u, count(*) as count\"}' -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -H \"Api-Key: <api_key>\"\n```\nand the results I'm currently getting on my test instance:\n![|690x224](upload://v2GCeJWxPZZEtevu7mnZ6d0cI9L.png)", "created_at": "2020-06-17 03:13:10.556372", "updated_at": "2020-06-17 03:13:10.556372", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 325, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 26.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4022], "is_private": false}, {"id": 34870, "user_id": 3729, "topic_id": 4116, "post_number": 4, "raw": "thank u very much matthias for your support .. very interesting examples btw, i will check their work and learn form it soon .. \nthank U again i hope to see you soon ..", "created_at": "2017-08-27 23:56:14.224061", "updated_at": "2017-08-27 23:56:14.224061", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 31, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 46.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [34847], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 50302, "user_id": 4736, "topic_id": 9421, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hello dear Edgeryders community!\n\nI would love to introduce BLATT 3000 to you, a collective I am part of which resonates with a few things I\u2019ve been stumbling upon in this forum. BLATT 3000 put up a \"self-curated\" festival named HOFFNUNG 3000 in Berlin and the software we built to realize this is getting a rewrite right now to be used by others.\n\n_[BLATT 3000](https://blatt3000.de) is a collective experimenting with collaborative, decentralized and self-organizing systems. BLATT 3000 works with these systems to critically engage in artistic practices and production and to create a community of practictioners in the process of these experimentations. BLATT 3000 takes action in the form of festivals, publications, workshops and research, utilising technology to enact non-commercial and non-hierarchical models of organizing. BLATT 3000 was founded on the idea of exchanging questions around music, art, theory and equality. BLATT 3000 opposes hierarchical ways of organizing and believes in open, collaborative and responsive models of communication and organization._\n\n_In 2016 we initiated a first self-curated festival [VERANTWORTUNG 3000](http://verantwortung3000.de/) (or https://github.com/adzialocha/verantwortung3000) in Brandenburg. In 2017, BLATT 3000 has tackled those questions of collaboration and self-organization through the festival [HOFFNUNG 3000](http://www.hoffnung3000.de) which was based on a hackable platform (https://github.com/adzialocha/hoffnung3000) where participants and audience members shared resources, organized events and themselves and curated their own festival, which was simultaneously realized in Berlin. HOFFNUNG 3000 was a \u201cworking\u201d festival, inviting participants to experiment and discuss inside and outside these environments. All participants were anonymized through animal avatars \u2013 also to challenge ideas of quality, equality and curation._\n\nYou can watch this little \"tutorial\" video to understand better what the HOFFNUNG 3000 platform offers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux2R9jwEIgw - some features are:\n\n* Offer / share / use resources in \"Der Markt\"\n* Create / offer and use places everywhere in the city (via GPS position, address or virtually)\n* Create events at places with resources (can be made public in a calendar or only privately), people get automatically informed if you requested their resources\n* Users can be anonymized through animal avatars :crocodile:\n* Internal messaging (can be anonymous)\n* Document the festival through the participants (mobile or stationary) webcams into a large .gif Stream\n* Random meetings: Meet random people at a random place\n\nDuring the last (fantastic!) *C35C3* (Chaos Communication Congress 2018) and meetings with Hugi at Blivande Huset, I realized how the \"old\" HOFFNUNG 3000 platform is still of interest for other initiatives and collectives, even though BLATT 3000 is already working on the next frameworks (utilizing peer to peer network protocols for truly decentralized architecture). It's software design was already thought as something to be used by others, but time worked against us, so some things got hard-coded in the last steps and turned out to be more BLATT 3000-specific :confused: Refactoring / reworking the HOFFNUNG 3000 software would enable more people to use it for theire own purposes.\n\nHugi kindly offered support with Participio to make this rewrite possible, which can be generally boiled down into two goals:\n\n1. Make HOFFNUNG 3000 easier to use and more customizable for other communities to be used for their own festivals / gatherings etc.\n2. Document the software well and improve its setup, so it will be rather easy to deploy your own HOFFNUNG 3000 instance without much programming knowledge\n\nI will write in another thread about the more technical reasonings and proceedings to reach these goals :slight_smile: the development started already!\n\nHappy to hear any feedback or thoughts on this,\n\nAll best,\nAndreas\n\nps.\nif you are interested, this is a little radio documentary about BLATT 3000 and the HOFFNUNG 3000 festival which was presented by Lakre Radio: https://soundcloud.com/thelakeradio/a-portrait-of-blatt-3000", "created_at": "2019-01-22 19:20:48.864494", "updated_at": "2019-08-04 00:18:18.902345", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 638, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 223.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 4022], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32738, "user_id": 2644, "topic_id": 4370, "post_number": 54, "raw": "<b>Hello from Tbilisi! </b>\n\n<span>Hi!

In the end he will not participate.\n\nDr. Nick: a speaker in the process of being interviewed by Inge.\n\n* Onboarding process: People in a facebook group are invited: they get a link to the platform post about the event. The people in schools where Jasen is conducting polls are also invited and asked to post.\nThe idea is that people will post once they will come to the workshop.\n\n* Participants list + online stories: their contacts are given in the school poll - we need to follow up with them and send them instructions.\nJasen: Do you want to get a lot of people? Or do you want to limit participation by making it a higher threshold?

I am personally living off-grid and from that experience I can tell that good monitoring of ones energy, water, wastewater, heating and cooling systems is essential for wise resource use and proper functioning. For example, I know that I need 500-700 Wh of photovoltaics energy a day, and that I can cope with at most 10 days of gray sky in winter. That\u2019s where IoT comes in.

At The Reef, with 3-4 people, if we want to have a communal dinner we have to make a (small) effort. Exert discipline. But at the unMonastery Matera, with maybe 10-12, this was just natural. Any one person was free to bail out on meals for whatever reason. But everyone knew that they could count on dinner to happen, with 6-10 people. The person on kitchen duty would ask around to get an idea on whether it would be more like 6 or more like 10, but no big deal either way, leftovers would be put away and quickly wiped out by the next hungry unBrethren. \n\nIn other words, when you get to 6-8 people the system of communal meals with \"kitchen duty\" combines conviviality _and_ individual freedom. Also, it is very, very economically efficient: it turned out we had overestimated the running costs by 50%! I see a risk of breakdown by \"too few\" as by \"too many\".

Growing up with such disability is not very relevant: looking on others playing, running, jumping, and swimming, while you may not do the same as they do only because of your disability! As I grew up, life for me was getting harder, both public and private places were almost inaccessible and not sufficiently adapted to people with disabilities.\n\nAs a result, you could not go wherever you want, barriers are everywhere (in addition to how is the society looking on you). Where you move you find that your disability is not taken into consideration in transportation, in libraries, schools, in municipalities, in banks and even in the street. With a very weak adaption of access to people using crutches, canes, wheelchairs, white canes,  and sign language, people use to spend a long time to find a suitable restaurant or a coffee-shop where you can get in  by themselves, or at least where people can help you with the minimum of difficulties.\n\nIn fact, I discovered later that around 13.5% of the population in Tunisia and around 15% of population in all over the world are encountering such issues.  As a disability rights advocate, and a Computer Science Researcher, I was looking for addressing the issue of accessibility since it is a fundamental element towards the social inclusion. Resolving this problem means protecting the dignity, the autonomy and the security of people who have deficiencies and find themselves in a disability situation only because the environment including the society are not considering them.\n\nThis has been the main idea of the initiative that I came up with: \"HandYwiN\u201d, which is a web based platform, based on crowd-sourcing and geo-localization technologies that determine and rate the level of accessibility and adaptability of the public and private places for people with disabilities and particularly, those who are using wheelchairs. Through this platform, people can rate places around them, in a participatory map, according to official criteria and norms of accessibility. The map shows then to its users the closest and accessible place that they need or they want to go. It determines also if a particular place is accessible and what are its affordances in terms if accessibility\n\nFurthermore, the platform will promote for places that are handicap friendly, public or private, while the social responsibility is becoming a corner stone in a modern economy and an obligation of all. This is in addition to the fact that by law, accommodation in public and private places to people with disabilities is obligatory. Therefore, in a country where a new democracy is being born, all people should be taken into consideration, including persons with disabilities.\n\nThanks to my Computer Science Masters degree and the funding that I received from the French Institute (Institut Fran\u00e7ais) due to my participation in SafiLab program in France during two excellent weeks that I spent in Paris. So that I was able to create a team of 5 members (Arbi Chouikh, Tarek Guelmami, Aymen Masmoudi, Azzen Abidi and Vanessa Adouani) who have developed the beta version of the platform. The platform will be well tested and several updates and improvements will be made relying to the users reviews during the one-month essay period.\n\nI am looking forward to keep fundraising to launch the final version of the platform and turn it into a sustainable social enterprise that contributes on guaranteeing the the wellbeing and the social inclusion of people with disabilities not only in Tunisia, but also in the world. HandYwiN is not only a mapping tool, it is also can be a valuable accessibility referential that compile the Good Practices of giving the possibility to everyone to go to places where is the autonomy, the security and the dignity. It would also alert the authorities about the inaccessible places and be an Advocacy tool.\n\nThis was the humble story of Arbi Chouikh, a disability rights advocate and a young social entrepreneur from Tunisia, who expect your awareness, your encouragement and your awareness.\n\nTo learn more about the project, please see https://www.facebook.com/HandYwiNCommunity/\n\nHere you find also some interviews about the project:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcx7Fk9hPqc&t=3s\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hr3ZmcODEbU&t=554s\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9ksYMCO8rY&t=2s\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AU4qhryywqY&t=5s", "created_at": "2017-08-20 10:09:30.556646", "updated_at": "2017-11-13 15:17:58.449011", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 764, "wiki": false, "reads": 25, "score": 562.0, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3703, 5, 3362], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4666, "user_id": 2201, "topic_id": 4633, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<span>Future Makers is an experimental initiative that aims to explore what happens when we combine the strengths of different networks (and their working styles) in novel collaborations, projects and online event formats.

One thing I could see being interesting in terms of combining our methods is the following: Using your method to determine what the most common co-occurrences and sentiments are for a particular news/information source (say, the Guardian, or even something like Breitbart) and compare those to the individual SSNAs of people who say they get their news/information from that source, or a composite of sources.

We'd have to write in Markdown and find a way to get a live preview in a second column, like here in Discourse. Markdown is quite ok even for writing long and complex documents ([example](/t/id/6463) on this platform) and has the advantage that people cannot create a mess using incoherent formatting. Finalizing the look & feel could be done by one person after import to LibreOffice.\n\n* For **databases**, [Obvibase](https://www.obvibase.com/) is pretty interesting. We used it for the Future Makers Nepal project, instead of that ugly hack of using online spreadsheets (like Google Sheets) as an ad-hoc database. It's not open source software, but run by one friendly programmer guy.\n\n* For **raster graphics drawing**, [DrawPile](http://drawpile.net/) is an amazing open source cross-platform application that allows synchronous collaboration, _including pressure sensitivity_ that can be used with graphics tablets or certain on-screen styluses (ThinkPad X series Tablets, Apple pen etc.).\n\n    For quick collaborative drawing sessions e.g. to illustrate concepts during a conference call, several collaborative sketching tools are available: [sketch.io Sketchpad](https://sketch.io/sketchpad/), [iscribble.net](http://www.iscribble.net/), [twiddla.com](http://www.twiddla.com/) and others.\n\n* For **vector oriented drawing** that allows synchronous collaboration, so far I don't know of anything that could replace Google Draw.\n\n* For **time tracking** with multiple users, it does not look bright. The best cross-platform tool that I could find that comes with local data storage and an optional self-hostable server is [Watson](https://tailordev.github.io/Watson), with the server-side companion [Crick](https://crick.io/). This is however a command-line tool. The situation is so dire that my brother started an open source project recently called [tom](https://github.com/jansorg/tom), with the user interface in [tom-ui](https://github.com/jansorg/tom-ui). Will be ready to use in 1-2 months.\n\nAnd for everything else, the [Frama services list](https://degooglisons-internet.org/en/list) is quite interesting. These are 33 free software tools that you can use in the version hosted by Frama or download and install yourself. Most are well-known open source applications like Etherpad Lite that were re-branded by Frama for their services.

(And actively working in a direction that it will change)\n\nIMO all existing approaches don't work for their own reasons. What they share is that they are coming from an old thinking where we translate how print worked into the digital age. \n\n1. Ads. \nObvious why they don't work. They put an incentive on quantity of content and shallow clicks, they drive the spread of emotional (mis)information instead of wisdom and useful information. \nHowever we need to be aware that ads will always be around as they are a tool for the market to optimise distribution by making consumers aware of products and services. The question is if that stays the main income source of online outlets. \nThe good thing is that ads bring in money that neither the publisher, nor the consumer has to pay for. \n\n2. Subscription models\nThey are a good start and it helped to validate that people are willing to pay for quality content. What makes the subscription model good is that it frees content providers from the necessity of optimising for clicks, but may be able to focus on producing quality content again. \nHowever they effectively create a 2 tier consumer society where some people just won't have access to this information. In my view it working somewhat against the purpose of journalism: to inform people. \nFrom a user perspective they are also horrible. Most readers are not reading content from just one provider, so buying a subscription from every of their sources is a decision making overkill and frankly too time consuming. Paid news aggregators only ease that problem, they don't solve it. What about all those little websites that are not big household names like the nytimes? How are they going to be funded if they are not included in something like Apple News or Blendl? \n\n3. Micropayment Services\nThe really good thing was that a user can determine for themselves how much worth their media consumption overall is and distribute the funds to any provider, big and small. This make an approach inclusive to many different types of contributions and potential income to smaller bloggers too. A student might just be able to pay 5 bucks, a CEO 200 and so forth. \nHowever approaches like Flattr didn't work because the service required to find an audience that values journalism enough to sign up for such a new service. From a UX perspective practically unusable as it required users to manually press a button for each article they want to pay. Big decision paralysis and frankly too much effort. \n\n\n### So how could a new approach look like?\n\nI think the inclusivity and user-centric flexibility of something like Flattr is the biggest step in the right direction I have seen so far. We've seen people like to pay, but we need to solve the UX issues that users have to decide who to give the money to. \nThis needs to happen automatically. \nThe question is how?\n\nFor doing so it would require having extensive data that can help to determine the usefulness/quality of content people see, and such a solution needs to be baked into another value proposition. It can't be a standalone service like Flattr. \n\nOne of the outputs of the project we run is to provide that data and that service to build on. \n\nAt worldbrain we develop Memex, an open source tool to search your web history, annotate and collaborate with peers when doing web research. So you can search for websites, papers and social posts you've seen with the vague memories you have. Like \"that article I visited last January with the words \"climate change\" in the text, it was on the nytimes.\"\nTo make search possible the tool gathers data about how users interact with content. (e.g. how long did they stay, how far they scrolled, if shared/liked on social media, sent via email/messenger with (positive) sentiment)\nAll data is stored locally of course and no data will ever be sent anywhere without user consent. \nSoon we will provide an API on which developers and entrepreneurs could build new tools with that data. \nOne of those could be a plugin that detects the the subjectively most useful content based on interaction data and automatically distributes the funds a user has allocated for their media consumption. This would IMO view solve the UX issues associated with current approaches to micropayments. \nBrave has also been going into that direction and it seems to work pretty well. They still combine it with ads though, which is an OK step in-between but hopefully ads will not play such a big role anymore or the market has adjusted to only wanting to run ads on useful content. \n\nFor more information on Memex, check out this post: https://edgeryders.eu/t/introducing-oliver-worldbrain-io-memex-and-storex-democratising-knowledge/10157", "created_at": "2019-06-14 19:12:15.902309", "updated_at": "2019-06-14 19:12:15.902309", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 862, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 38.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4934, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 79233, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 13884, "post_number": 8, "raw": "Do you mean, to post the interview in video form and then code it?

Location-based, real-time \u2013 services, applications to strengthen communities, and the capacity to generate high quality data in information overload, these are all possibilities within a wired connected environment that need serious exploration and research.\n\nIn Art and Agency, an Anthropological Theory47, Alfred Gell puts emphasis \u201cupon art\nas a form of instrumental action: the making of things as a means of influencing the thoughts and actions of others\u201d. He defines volt sorcery as the \u201cpractice of inflicting harm on the prototype of an index by inflicting harm on the index, for example, sticking pins into a wax image of the prototype\u201d. In Gell\u2019s theory the index is located in the region where the sphere of agency (the primary agent) overlaps with the vulnerability of thecausal milieu of the recipient. In our case the index is located in the region where the sphere of agency of the firmware on the hard disks (control) overlaps with its openness to different practices and interpretations by the hive software. The question is, can we immobilize or reformulate the subject (the set of business practices and real people articulating their agency through these business practices of patents and intellectual property laws) in this way? Seizing and scheming towards this opportunity to make sense, to have fully analyzed and grasped a situation \u2013 such as the recent individual agency in open source content-networks-software and hardware \u2013 will not lead to major organizational, political, and design breakthroughs, if we are not able to fully grasp the trajectory from thing as gathering places for spaces and discussion, from \u2018matters of concern\u2019:\n\n\u201cA heuristic use of the term \u2018thing\u2019 has also been adopted by Bruno Latour, who, after Heidegger, has worked to transform the semantic emphasis of \u2018things\u2019 from \u2018matters of concern\u2019. Drawing on older etymologies in which \u2018thing\u2019 denoted a gathering place, a space for discussion and negotiation; Latour has rehabilitated this sense of the term as a way out of the twin cul-de-sac of constructivism and objectivity\u201d.\n\nThe story is no longer metaphor, no longer as if or \u2018as\u2019 something else, no, the story is the thing now, it is the protocol.\n\nhttps://www.networkcultures.org/_uploads/notebook2_theinternetofthings.pdf", "created_at": "2019-05-30 13:48:51.367998", "updated_at": "2019-05-30 13:48:51.367998", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 418, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 28.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [54225], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7148, "user_id": 33, "topic_id": 1726, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>The downside of the Danish model</b>\n\n<span>The Danish model, while flexible, is still pretty faulty. While on social welfare you're obliged to take any job they tell you to. There's a scandal going on right now because some people are sent out to repackage sweets and adjust the expiration date so they can be sold instead of thrown out. But as a welfare recipient you will be denied your subsidy if you decline the job. And while on unemployment welfare you can take internships in order to establish contact with the job market. The idea is good because research shows that companies are more likely to hire an intern permanently than a \"stranger\" who sends in a CV. The downside, however, is that Danish companies are not above taking advantage of that opportunity thus continually hiring new unpaid interns every quarter in order to save money on real salaries.</span>\n\n<span>Conversely, companies can opt to hire you full-time but only pay half your salary, the rest being supplemented by the state.

They made some interesting points.\u00a0I tried to reconstruct them, but there might be some holes in it.\n\nMost 'activism' today is done by do-ers. Bottom-up initiatives that took it upon themselves to solve problems that governments should take care of.\u00a0They noted that this shift to just getting your hands dirty and\u00a0not\u00a0wait for\u00a0government action\u00a0is actually quite\u00a0a neo-liberal way of solving problems.\n\nThe\u00a0ideal of May '68 has become ingrained in the way the mainstream thinks.\u00a0The loss of faith in government and institutions has become part of a normal way of thinking. Management and corporations have adopted it in a way: they want to get\u00a0rid of the old and slow processes, they want radical disruption asap\u00a0and would like as few interventions by government\u00a0as possible. Government is mainly seen as an obstacle at this point.\n\nBottom-up initiatives follow the same reasoning to a large extent. Government is one of the obstacles to be overcome, because they're perceived as ingerently part of the problem, almost an external factor that is unchangeable. But they have to do it\u00a0with less means,\u00a0less people and less power (leading to the burnout problem).\u00a0Additionally, the whole neo-liberal side\u00a0will see these projects and initiators as 'one of them', because of the shared 'entrepreneurial activism'. For an outsider, the difference between both fades.\n\nOne of their conclusions was that there is a\u00a0need for political activism by these bottom-up activists right now, rather than only acting boots on the ground. Otherwise real systemic change may not follow, as politics today is mainly politics for the sake of politics, heavily influenced by big economy.\n\nWhat do you think about this?\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-03 09:22:34", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:56.522537", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 354, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 84597, "user_id": 6765, "topic_id": 14499, "post_number": 5, "raw": "**Your question, reflection or experience** <br /> My LinkedIn name is Fotios Kotzakioulafis and I am seeking to build a career in the European Union <br /><br /> **Would you like to schedule a call with the organizers of the webinar?** <br /> No <br /><br />", "created_at": "2020-10-08 13:10:46.519260", "updated_at": "2020-10-08 13:10:46.519260", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 43, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 27.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4934], "is_private": false}, {"id": 48250, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 9133, "post_number": 12, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2018-11-02 15:11:15.642257", "updated_at": "2018-11-02 15:11:15.642257", "deleted_at": "2018-11-14 05:27:36.392638", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 68847, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 12419, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Money quote from there:\n\n> The funding of climate research appears to be based on the assumption that if natural scientists work out the causes, impacts, and technological remedies of climate change, then politicians, officials, and citizens will spontaneously change their behavior to tackle the problem.

Most projects are documented by a couple of paragraphs of project descriptions, but nothing else (exception: <a href=\"/u/katalin\">@katalin</a>). For example, The Book of Errors has an explanation of what the project means to do, but then there is no actual Book of Errors, or link to some wiki where the errors are being entered and interpreted.\n\nThere are also projects that go completely missing. One is the Festival of Growing, and we know why, with the mini-flame war of the past weeks. The other is food distribution unchained, and we do\u00a0<em>not\u00a0</em>know why. The project has made it to the finals of the European Social Innovation Competition, and it would be nice to flaunt it a bit. <a href=\"/u/lois\">@Lois</a>\u00a0is completely under the radar: I already asked her to post what she is doing, but so far nothing is happening.\n\nLack of documentation is not ok, and it creates me an embarassing situation with MT2019. It's great that you guys are transparent about buying local food, but <strong>the city is investing for you to do the projects</strong>, and that is where accountability needs to be focused. <a href=\"/u/la_gaia\">@La_Gaia</a>, this needs to be the main focus of the evaluation, IMHO.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-20 10:14:42", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:34.911684", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 382, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 73805, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 12920, "post_number": 20, "raw": "Can I unpin this topic now that we have the list with all calls?

You meet 100,000 patients with a certain profile. 80 of them will develop a certain condition. You cannot predict that any individual patient will develop the condition, but you do know that 80 of them will. \n\nAs profiles get more precise, they should correlate more tightly with the predicted outcomes... unless, of course, they become so precise as to run into a small numbers problem. In that case, yes, the situation becomes analog to that described by Peters. I guess I would call that a classic problem of decreasing returns on modelling precision. \n\n[quote=\"markomanka, post:1, topic:11075\"]\nBut 20 to 30 years after, the impact of electronic health records on medical practice isn\u2019t that great: it takes a lot of time out of care.

It\u2019s really systematic of the system. The problem lies not in the idea that we want to have policies to regulate issues, the problem is how we do them. And the same happens for standards. Most of the standards are imposed after de facto companies who ruled the market have agreed about it on the phone. I\u2019ve hardly ever seen any standard being imposed before the large companies were already ready for them.\n[/quote]\n\nEurope prides itself on involving stakeholder in decisions that affect them. And that is a good principle, but it often goes wrong, with powerful corporate interests capturing the regulation. I guess the stakeholder model was born in a late 19th-early 20th century context, where the might of the state was thought to be vastly superior to that of any private actor; and that rewarded social peace.

This post documents the event itself, as well as its implications for The Reef as I see them. \n\nCLTB now consists of an association (ASBL) and a foundation of public utility. \n\n* The foundation buys and holds on to land, which is subtracted to market logic forever (in principle), since it can not be resold. Land acquisition if funded by grants.\n* The association manages the land, in a broad sense. This includes launching new projects for new buildings, finding the buyers, contracting the architect and construction companies, and managing the buildings after construction. \n\nThis model:\n\n* is **social**. What is being built is social housing, and only that. Failing this, CLTB could not obtain the grants they have been using.\n* is **acquisitive** (acquisitif). A CLTB always buys land. \n\nRecently, CLTB started thinking about how to use the Community Land Trust Model in other ways: for example, to propose non-social housing, or to launch spaces for purposes other than housing. To do this, they decided they need a third legal entity, a cooperative. They have then launched a participatory process to design one, inviting several entities (including Edgeryders) to participate. \"Designing\" a cooperative in this context means defining:\n\n1. Vision. \n2. Business model.\n3. Governance.\n4. UVP.\n\nThe idea is to go through a process that will define these four items, and lead to a legal launch of the cooperative in March 2020.\n\nAbout 25-30 people showed up for the meeting, which took five hours. They divided the stakeholders in four groups, and asked them to state what they would need to adhere to the new cooperative. The groups were:\n\n1. CLTB\n2. *Utilisateurs*\n3. *Investisseurs*\n4. *Contribueurs* (Edgeryders were assigned to this group).\n\nThere is still some confusion as to the different roles in the cooperative. First of all, who are the cooperators? Is this to be a cooperative of people who use spaces, for housing or other uses (cooperative of *utilisateurs*)? Or is it to be a cooperative of projects of alternative land use (cooperative of *contribueurs*)? Or both? Are cooperators going to be individuals, organizations, or both? If the answers to these questions are \"both\", how will the cooperative ensure alignment of incentives across so diverse a membership? \n\nThe category of *contribueurs* was by far the messiest. In fact, Geert De Pauw, CLTB's coordinator, told me he thought we were \"*utilisateurs* and *contribueurs* at the same time\". This became clear in the breakout with the other *contribueurs*. This group included people like us, with very specific projects (examples: housing for both people with disabilities and able-bodied folks; housing for vulnerable women, etc.), but also Perspective Bruxelles (Yves Van De Casteele). Some people in the group focused on values (\"for my organization it is very important that the cooperative is committed to gender diversity\"), whereas I took the approach that values were to be encoded in cooperators rather than in the cooperative. The latter would simply be a tool to provide a shared service to the former, just like vineyard farmers join forces to build and run a cooperative facility to squeeze and ferment everybody's grapes into wine. The choice of what kind of wine to produce, and how much, is still with the farmers, who do not need to agree in order to cooperate. \n\nThe structural problem we were facing is this. CLTB wants a cooperative to do all kinds of stuff that their current model prevents them to do. But this very openness makes it more difficult to identify a \"core service\" that all these very different projects would need.\n\nI signed Edgeryders up to help work on the cooperative's vision and UVP. @noemi, do you think I should send Geert these notes as a form of restitution and feedback?", "created_at": "2019-11-15 16:31:42.093201", "updated_at": "2019-11-15 16:31:42.093201", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 663, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 47.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 64621, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 11175, "post_number": 3, "raw": "@BaobabUrbain @manuelpueyo can you check the updated Agenda and see if it look OK for now?

There, things happen through legislation, policy briefs, and ultimately boring but important things like procurement guidelines. It's that translation that I'm trying to contribute - if you check my references, you'll find Adam's work (alongside many other critical theorists) represented plentiful there. On Monday, a new report that I co-authored around smart cities and (progressive) policies will be published by FEPS, a Brussels-based political foundation/think tank.

Activism that emphasises changing the pace of the city and foregrounding presence, vulnerability and the beauty of the earth. The dance groups on the streets for the COP21 shifted me.\n\nBeen thinking about action on the streets & since culture is obsessed with excitement - anything too high paced is likely just to feed the machine and be yet another ride on the wheel... For where there is hectic business, there is all the distraction, blindness and madness of this suicidal culture. This sense that \u201cthe time is now\u201d can be met by something present. Instead of putting that intense feeling into multiple short-lived projects, to make energy matter. To use energy with real intention. One way of spreading courage and alternatives is to be in total presence. What about an action that expressed a great slowing down into presence during the Open Village? Slowing down the pace of the streets with movement. Done a few things like this before - I led a slow motion walk up Oxford high street in the last decade to protest the Iraq war. So - what about a short workshop and then an action of dancing slowly (in whatever your style) in the streets? Gifting pieces of fruit to passers by? A way of spreading the invitation.

It would use image classifiers (\"artificial intelligence\") and work on a Raspberry Pi 3 computer or similar.\n\nCoffee lovers know that the quality of coffee depends a lot on the final sorting of coffee beans \u2013 80% of beans are sorted by hand (and these are of course low-wage jobs), the rest by industrial machines called \"optical sorters\". All existing optical sorters are way too costly for small-scale coffee farmers, likewise for small roasters (or community homes like The Reef :slight_smile:) interested in producing own high-quality coffee.\n\nThis changes with an idea I developed a few months ago to some maturity: the open source optical coffee sorter. I wrote down a more technical plan in the last section below, see there for details incl. proposed computing hardware and software. The software part includes artificial intelligence for \"better than perfect\" bean sorting.\n\nIn my estimate, a price of <300 USD is realistic, compared to at least 10,000 USD for Chinese-made industrial machines. Roasters in Europe indicated to me that such a machine is interesting to them as well, so there is an initial \"higher end\" market to serve, for example by a pre-order type of crowdfunding. Later, you'd go into mass-producing the machine and selling it to small coffee farmers who now have to sort by hand. (There is a woman empowerment aspect here, since most of the low-wage manual coffee sorting is currently done by women.)\n\nAnd if you're not into coffee, you can also adapt the concept to sort all kinds of local agricultural products: nuts, dates, fruits, spices, whatever. (Even rice and other grains is usually going through an optical sorter before it hits the market.)\n\n**Economic rationale**\n\nThe optical coffee sorter is not a direct competitor to existing industrial solutions. Rather, it attempts to enable a different economic model. Its use case is a single producer or a small cluster of local producers (for example, < 10 coffee farmers in a village in Nepal) who wish to produce high quality, premium priced \"single origin coffee\".\n\n* Technically, the optical coffee sorter should be cheap much cheaper and much more precise than industrial solutions. To obtain this, it sacrifices speed and scale, which remain much lower than those prevailing in industry.\n\n* Economically, the optical coffee sorter is a solution for the farmers to appropriating  a higher share of the added value of \"single origin coffee\", selling the product already shelled and sorted. Industrial machines are efficient at scale, and serve large roasteries. There is no point being precise, because everything gets mixed up anyway. In this model, there is no point being super-fast and efficient, because the single-origin crop is small anyway. \n\n\n## 2. How to contribute <a name=\"chap-2\"></a>\n\nThe first major round of development happened from January to April 2018 during the [OpenVillage Academy in Sidi Kaouki, Morocco](/t/id/7617), where we worked on the machine with a small team.\n\nWe do not yet have a working machine \u2013 this will need one or two more development sprints. All output from the previous development work is documented in this text and texts linked from here.\n\n\n### 2.1. Development environment <a name=\"chap-2-1\"></a>\n\nOur development environment is publicly viewable. The following is all the data we have for the project:\n\n* [**Central document**](/t/id/7122), this very document, serving as the index document for the whole project\n\n* [**Forum**](https://edgeryders.eu/tags/project-coffee-sorter), for all public online discussions about the project. Simply create a topic on [edgeryders.eu](https://edgeryders.eu/) and tag it `project-coffee-sorter`.\n\n* [**Github repository `coffee-cobra`**](https://github.com/edgeryders/coffee-cobra), for the coffee sorter software, running on the Raspberry Pi 3\n\n* [**Google Drive folder**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1r-DR5b2aDCCFU6OWMM6q2xuXNLhWBYBP?usp=sharing) for all files resulting from the project; ask anyone from the development team if you need edit access\n\n* [**Dynalist tasklist**](https://dynalist.io/d/8I41AdtRSel0ZFVKeNvovZzv#z=1UF3HxWXmsLSS1vKsNRCIJmI) for collecting and assigning all development related tasks, following [Edgeryders' usual conventions](/t/id/7618) for using Dynalist\n\nAnd we use the following open source software tools:\n\n* **[FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org)** as our open source 3D CAD tool. This seems to be definitely the best available open source 3D CAD tool right now. The only alternative being BRL-CAD, which has a very old codebase. And Blender, which does not provide the nice engineering-related features of FreeCAD (measures, part design mode, FEM etc.).\n\n* **CPython** as the interpreter for the Python programming language\n\nSome tips for FreeCAD:\n\n* Installation under Ubuntu Linux is very simple: `sudo apt install freecad`\n\n* By default, navigation in the scene does not properly work under Linux. You have to select a suitable navigation mode and it will start to work. If you have a touchscreen or tablet with pen input, the best navigation mode is \"[Gesture](https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Mouse_Model#Gesture_Navigation_.28v0.16.29)\": set \"Edit \u2192 Preferences \u2192 3D View \u2192 3D Navigation: Gesture\". Alternatively, right-click on the view and choose \"Navigation styles \u2192 Gesture\".\n\n\n### 2.2.

Technical analysis and design <a name=\"chap-3\"></a>\n\n### 3.1. Introduction to optical sorters <a name=\"chap-3-1\"></a>\n\nCoffee has to be \"picked\" before roasting and brewing, because there are all kinds of impurities and defective beans that impact its taste. See [this article](http://www.coffeereview.com/coffee-reference/from-crop-to-cup/processing/cleaning-and-sorting/) for a good overview of the processes, and [here](https://morecoffee.com/articles/grading_coffee) for pictures of the machines involved. Essentially, in small-scale coffee farming, sorting is done manually, and very often by the women of these farms. Large companies however have high-tech machines, so-called [optical sorters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_sorting), that do this task full automatically. Things basically fall through them and land in the bins you want them in \u2013 [see](http://www.satake-usa.com/pikasen-alpha/). This difference in technological leverage is also a main reason why small-scale coffee farmers are paid badly. Coffee that is free from defective beans commands higher prices \u2013 for example the widely used SCAA classification scheme relies mostly on this, and classifies coffee reasonably free from defects as specialty coffee ([see](http://www.coffeeresearch.org/coffee/scaaclass.htm)). As one roaster writes: \"For large, professional coffee farms, a Fair Trade membership is not meaningful as they have equipment to pick / process the raw coffee by themselves. Due to the increased quality, they obtain prices that are a multiple of those of Fair Trade.\" ([source](https://www.berliner-kaffeeroesterei.de/manufaktur/kaffee/), translation by me). So to support small-scale coffee farmers, incl. those I work with in Nepal, an optical sorter would help a lot, freeing much work time for the women that they can use for other tasks, while still bringing them the profits of high-quality, carefully processed coffee. It is true that manual coffee sorting brings a lot of employment ([as argued here](http://www.coffeereview.com/coffee-reference/from-crop-to-cup/processing/cleaning-and-sorting/)), but that employment is of very low wage. And if wages are too low, coffee farming is not profitable even for poor people \u2013 that's exactly a complaint [we heard](https://youtu.be/xvagkP-bzy8) from \"our\" farmers in Hansapur. There's nothing against machines if their profit goes to the people they replace. While we can't guarantee that in all cases when releasing an open hardware machine, we can make it so cheap that every village can afford one, just like they can afford other basic farm equipment to make their work more efficient. Now commercial optical sorters cost at least 10,000 USD \u2013 [Alibaba has a list](https://www.alibaba.com/trade/search?fsb=y&IndexArea=product_en&CatId=&SearchText=color+sorting+machine&isGalleryList=G). Or [around 40,000 USD](https://www.machinio.com/manufacturer/satake#quickview/19766552) for the smallest one (in used condition!) from world market leader Satake. Given the small production amounts of smallholder coffee farms, that kind of machine makes no sense at all. Let's make an open hardware color sorter for 100 - 300 USD instead, appropriate for the amounts they have to process.\n\n\n### 3.2. Basic machine concept <a name=\"chap-3-2\"></a>\n\nSorting green coffee beans is essentially \"[density sorting](http://www.coffeeresearch.org/agriculture/densitysort.htm)\", \"size sorting\" (sieving) and \"[color sorting](http://www.coffeeresearch.org/agriculture/colorsorting.htm)\". All of this is usually done with large machines. The innovation here is that _we can do it all with a single digital machine_. It will not be made for a high throughput. Instead it will run 24/7/365, and if you really need to scale up operations further, you add more identical machines in parallel (which also adds redundancy). We estimate below that, with proper optimization, a single Raspberry Pi 3 could sort 250-300 coffee beans per second as a pure color sorter, or 100 items per second if using AI image classification at times, as we intend to do. That results in a daily resp. yearly throughput of:\n\n* 100 beans/s \u00d7 3600 s/h \u00d7 24 h/d \u00d7 [0.171 g/bean](https://www.quora.com/What-is-average-weight-of-one-coffee-bean-in-grams) \u00d7 (1 kg / 1000 g) = 1478 kg/d = **~1.5 t/d**\n\n* 100 beans/s \u00d7 3600 s/h \u00d7 24 h/d \u00d7 365 d/a \u00d7 [0.171 g/bean](https://www.quora.com/What-is-average-weight-of-one-coffee-bean-in-grams) \u00d7 (1 t / 1,000,000 g) = ~**540 t/a**\n\nThis is more than even a medium-sized coffee farmer coop will have to process. Even if we only achieve 10% of that throughput with the machine, it will already be useful \u2013 for comparison, a village next to \"our\" coffee village Hansapur (I think it's Bichaur, but not sure) has been into coffee for long and, for Nepali standards, on a large scale. They produce 3 tons of coffee per year, which would be sorted in 20 days with a machine achieving just 10% of the throughput we hope for ( 3 t / (1.5 t/d * 0.1) = 20 d). Now 20 days is approximately half of the time the coffee harvest takes (since it ripens over the course of weeks), which means one such machine would be well enough for a village like this. The basic idea here is to combine a microgram scale and cameras in one machine to allow sizing, density sorting and color sorting. The scale determines the weight, volume is inferred from profile images takes from each of the three main axes, and from both values together the density can be calculated \u2013 which is a good indicator of quality. Size is determined from an image taken from the top. Finally, full-color high resolution images are processed with computer vision to determine any defects. Regarding that step, the color sorter market leader admits: \"The green coffee bean is one of the most challenging sorts in the agriculture industry because of the slight color differences in the beans.\" ([source](http://www.satake-usa.com/pikasen-alpha/)). So maybe, since we are working at slower speeds anyway, a deep learning algorithm will be the better basis compared to a faster, highly tuned but also highly fragile color sorting algorithm.\n\n\n### 3.3. Sorter projects for inspiration and / or utilization <a name=\"chap-3-3\"></a>\n\nThese projects point into the right direction how a possible implementation could look like. Some are open source and could directly serve as a basis.\n\n1. **Open source peanut sorter.** It uses a Raspberry Pi and a color CCD camera to sort peanuts by by color, height/width ratio and shape, and achieved 42 kg/h by analyzing 2.5 frames per second with 4 peanuts each. See: \"[Image Processing Method For Embedded Optical Peanut Sorting](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288021931)\".\n\n2. **Open Source Walnut Sorter.** Very nice, as it integrates scales just as it is intended here. See: \"[A Computer Vision Based Machine for Walnuts Sorting Using Robot Operating System](https://books.google.de/books?id=Qv6qDQAAQBAJ&lpg=PA9&ots=wTsuc0qBQX&dq=open%20hardware%20sorting%20machine&pg=PA9#v=onepage&q&f=false)\".\n\n3. **Cucumber Sorter, using TensorFlow.** Machine vision for cucumber classification using Google's open source neural network platform TensorFlow. Limited success so far, as even 7000 training images were not enough to go past 70% recognition rate. Also, it needs a cloud based server for computation. However it also indicates that running TensorFlow on a Raspberry Pi for the initial step of detecting if there is a cucumber on the image at all is successful. See: \"[How a Japanese cucumber farmer is using deep learning and TensorFlow](https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2016/08/how-a-japanese-cucumber-farmer-is-using-deep-learning-and-tensorflow)\".\n\n4. **Screw Sorter.** Maybe not open source, but all instructions and files are shared freely. Made by a guy in FabLab Moscow. See: [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdDgeb2y6v0), and the full instructable \"[Screw Sorting Machine](https://www.instructables.com/id/Screw-Sorting-Machine/)\".\n\n4. **AutoTrash, a trash sorter using TensorFlow.** A trash can using a Raspberry Pi and TensorFlow to separate compostable and recyclable trash items \u2013 [see](https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/13/auto-trash-sorts-garbage-automatically-at-the-techcrunch-disrupt-hackathon). Interesting because it is another project successfully running TensorFlow on a Raspberry Pi.\n\n5. **Various color sorters for skittles and lego.** These do not provide any relevant computer vision algorithms, but the mechanics (and their control) is very similar or identical to what we need. Many tinkerers have tried their luck, and here the most inspiring machines I could find:\n\n    *   [High speed M&M sorting machine](http://www.reviewmylife.co.uk/blog/2014/12/22/high-speed-mandm-sorting-machine/) \u2013 Very interesting one as it uses a different mechanism: gates with linear electromagnetic actuators to divert an object in free fall. Uses an Arduino and a relay board to control these.\n    *   [M&Ms and Skittles sorting machine](https://willemm.nl/mm-skittles-sorting-machine/) \u2013 Definitely the most beautiful one :-) Only 3D printed and CNC cut parts and a nice, elegant design.\n    *   [Sorting Machine - Skittles and M&M's 8 Color Sorting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6NQqGH1LBY) \u2013 Very interesting one, as it uses a binary gate mechanism in three levels. Allows faster bin selection than a rotary mechanism, and always in the same, predictable time.\n    *   [Arduino Color Sorter Project](http://howtomechatronics.com/projects/arduino-color-sorter-project/) \u2013 Simple one, but comes with Arduino source code.\n    *   [Color Sorting Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5k3uUMJdlk) \u2013 Sorts lego. Interesting mechanism to get items off the conveyor belt.\n    *   [Arduino Skittle Sorter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70mvw2d8bN4) \u2013 Has an ingenious \"channel disk\" mechanism to control target bins with a single stepper motor.\n    *   [The Unnecessarily Complicated and Over-Constrained Skittle Sorter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0N0SImxX_MI) \u2013 Like they say. It's a three-axis CNC with a vacuum gripper. Still inspiring, as one could for example combine a delta robot and a flatbed scanner to acquire very high resolution images of many beans at once. If the bot can suck up the beans instead of moving them one by one, it could even be efficient.\n    *   [Sorting Machine - Skittles and M&M's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7HTQai7Wwg) \u2013 Nice one, with just two servo motors and some 3D printed parts. Rate is one per second, but the mechanics could allow 4-6 per second.\n    *   [Nonstop Skittles sorting machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSEHDBSynVo) \u2013 Nice one, as it is fully 3D printed. Uses a conveyor belt mechanism, which allows to \"park\" items on a longer belt in case processing takes longer.\n    *   [High Speed Candy Sorting Machine](https://hackaday.io/project/10302-high-speed-candy-sorting-machine) \u2013 Attempt with air jets similar to the commercial machines. Not very successful so far, indicating that it's not a good alternative for small-scale machinery.\n\n6. **[Bext360 coffee cherry sorter](https://bext360.com/).** The machine works like a reverse vending machine where farmers pour in the cherries they harvested and the machine sorts and grades them and pays the harvest worker immediately. It is integrated into the Bext products for blockchain based product tracking and authentication throughout the supply chain.\n\n\n### 3.4. Useful components <a name=\"chap-3-4\"></a>\n\nThis section lists building blocks \u2014whether hardware or software\u2013 that are probable to be useful for an open source optical sorter.\n\n1. **[Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/).** Since its release in 2019-07, this is the favourite base hardware here. Preliminary evaluation: with its quad-core CPU, it will have about the same or better performance as the ODROID XU-4, which was our previous favourite, but for [about the same price](https://www.reichelt.de/de/de/-p259920.html) would come with 4 GiB RAM rather than 2 GiB.\n\n2. **ODROID XU-4.** An alternative to the Raspberry Pi 3 that could be preferable as \"cost per computing power\" could be lower: the ODROID C2 uses the [ARM-Cortex A53](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_Cortex-A53) CPU just as the Raspberry Pi 3, but at 1.5 GHz rather than the Pi 3's 1.2 GHz, and also comes with 2 GiB DDR3 RAM rather than 1 GiB DDR2 as the Pi 3 \u2013 compare [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ODROID) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi).  Especially the further-improved ODROID XU-4 seems the right choice, as it has at least four times the performance of the Raspberry Pi 3 in all benchmarks ([see](http://www.hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php?g_code=G143452239825)) at a price of less than two times that of the Raspberry Pi 3 ([59 USD](http://www.hardkernel.com/main/main.php) vs. 35 USD).\n\n3. **Raspberry Pi 3.** Given that the Raspberry Pi 3 delivers an [amazing amount of CPU computing power per dollar](http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=raspberry-pi-3&num=6), it seems interesting to investigate how to implement the sorting machine with it. In terms of GFLOPS computing power of the GPU, high-end NVidia GPUs will be about half the money per GFLOPS, but still the Raspberry Pi is much preferable \u2013 for a discussion of all this, see the section on the \"Nvidia Jetson TX1 / TX2\" boards below.\n\n4. **[OpenCV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCV).** One of the best open source computer vision libraries.\n\n5. **[Plant Image Analysis](https://www.plant-image-analysis.org/).** \nA collection of software packages (often open source) and open datasets for analyzing images of plants and plant parts. There is nothing specialized for seeds in there right now, but I found the following open source software packages in there that can possibly be applied for this:\n\n    * [PlantCV](https://www.plant-image-analysis.org/software/plantcv), seems to be the most suitable candidate\n    * [ImageJ](https://www.plant-image-analysis.org/software/imagej)\n    * [Icy](https://www.plant-image-analysis.org/software/icy)\n    * [Endrov](https://www.plant-image-analysis.org/software/endrov)\n    * [BioImageXD](https://www.plant-image-analysis.org/software/bioimagexd)\n    * [Bisque](https://www.plant-image-analysis.org/software/bisque)\n\n6. **TensorFlow on Raspberry Pi.** TensorFlow is Google's open source AI framework, one of the most advanced. While that sounds to be an unlikely combination, it has been successfully used in at least the following projects. TensorFlow packages for the Raspberry Pi [are available](https://github.com/samjabrahams/tensorflow-on-raspberry-pi).\n\n    * **Caltrain delay predictor.** Interesting because it again runs TensorFlow on Raspberry Pi hardware. See the [project website](http://www.svds.com/project/listening-caltrain/), or an overview with links [on opensource.com](https://opensource.com/article/17/2/machine-learning-projects-tensorflow-raspberry-pi).\n    * **Meter Maid monitor.** Recognizes \"meter maid\" vehicles of the city government and then warns its users that their parking meter time is starting for real now. See the overview with links [on opensource.com](https://opensource.com/article/17/2/machine-learning-projects-tensorflow-raspberry-pi).\n\n7. **DeepBelief on Raspberry Pi.** Another deep learning library for image classification. See [source code](https://github.com/jetpacapp/DeepBeliefSDK) incl. [instructions for RPi](https://github.com/jetpacapp/DeepBeliefSDK/tree/master#getting-started-on-a-raspberry-pi). It has been ported to the RPi [by Pete Warden](https://petewarden.com/2014/06/09/deep-learning-on-the-raspberry-pi/).\n\n8. **[Open source computer vision framework for Linux](https://ribalda.github.io/assets/docs/ThesisRibalda.pdf).** A PhD thesis introducing an open source, modular, standardized computer vision system based on Linux. It includes as an industrial (but proprietary) application of a potator grader working at 40 frames per second and 28 tons per hour, inspecting the whole surface of each potato at 1 mm\u00b2 resolution and evaluating it with a 9-neuron neuronal network. This high-performance system seems a good choice, even when the implementation is done \"just\" on a Raspberry Pi.\n\n9. **[Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page).** A fast linear algebra library that is used in (for example) TensorFlow. Convolutional neural networks spend by far their most computation time on matrix multiplication, so this is a very crucial component for speed.\n\n10. **[CMUcam 5 Pixy](http://www.cmucam.org/projects/cmucam5/wiki).** One of the best camera modules for Raspberry Pi, ca. 70-80 EUR.\n\n11. **[Qtechnolgy cameras](https://github.com/qtec/build-qt5022-core/wiki/Introduction).** Industrial cameras for computer vision applications with a completely open source software stack. Interesting, but too expensive for this project (and their kind of performance is not needed here either).\n\n12. **Coffee Laboratory Digital Imaging Software.** Uses a flatbed scanner to acquire images, and generates statistical reports with measurements of width, breadth, density, color values etc.. [For sale on coffeelabequipment.com](http://www.coffeelabequipment.com/COFFEESOFTWARE.html). Not open source or anything, but an interesting take on obtaining high resolution images that could be replicated.\n\n13. **[SparkFun Open Scale](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13261).** A 30 USD board with an amplifier and serial data connection that allows to read weight values from connected load cells (load sensors).\n\n14. **[Load cells for 0-500g](http://eu.mouser.com/Sensors/Force-Sensors-Load-Cells/_/N-deui5?P=1yw1b6xZ1z0jtqd).** Not cheap though. Might be better to disassemble cheap off-the-shelf micro scales, like [one of these](https://publiclab.org/wiki/instrument-review-inexpensive-digital-balances).\n\n15. **Overstock notebook mainboards.** This seems to be another way to get a lot of computing power for little money: mount bare notebook mainboards with powerful processors into the sorter machine. They are often available in amounts of tens or hundreds from sellers on eBay, and for very cheap because they are not very useful (only made to fit into one notebook model, and with a fixed soldered CPU). Given the x86 platform standard basic hardware support of Linux for more or less all notebooks, hardware differences would not matter much when one supply runs dry. The board mounting and power supply would simply be designed configurable.\n\n16. **x86 based SBO / COM / SOM / Mini-ITX.** These are other embedded computing solutions: single board computers, computer-on-module and system-on-module devices with x86 CPUs. In addition, there are nice Mini-ITX mainboards. They would provide more computing power than a Raspberry Pi, but not nearly as cost efficient as the idea of using overstock notebook mainboards. Still here are some interesting devices and offers:\n\n    * **[Asus H81TMini-ITX mainboard](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B00GYLFO4G).** Very nice and cheap, at 88 EUR incl. shipment in new condition. However it does not include the CPU or RAM.\n    * **[Portwell WADE-8321 SBC](https://www.ebay.com/itm/262140846408).** Basically the cheapest single-board computer mainboard in Mini-ITX form factor to get \u2013 right now 63 USD. Howevever it does not include a CPU, and overstock mainboards for notebooks are available for that price with a CPU already, so much superior in terms of pricing.\n    * **[More Mini-, Nano- and Pico-ITX boards](http://www.axiomtek.com/Default.aspx?MenuId=Products&FunctionId=ProductCat&Cat=204).** The board sizes are 170x170, 120x120 and 100x71 mm, respectively. The smaller two have only onboard CPU options.\n    * **[More Mini ITX mainboards](http://www.mini-itx.com/store/?c=2).** Quite a few of them, some with onboard processor, some with a socket. Some have DC power input just as notebooks, instead of requiring an ATX power adapter.\n    * **[Embedded computing devices at Mouser](http://eu.mouser.com/new/embedded-solutions/computing/n-aez39).**\n    * **[COM Express COM](http://www.mini-itx.com/store/?c=2).** In sizes 125x95 mm and 95x95 mm. However, they require a carrier board for routing out all the I/O connections out. Also, as they are meant for medical devices, they will be quite expensive.\n\n17. **Used notebook CPUs (not adequate).** It is true that notebook CPUs are available for very cheap (<20 EUR) by buying damaged notebook mainboards and unsoldering them. It is also technically feasible to solder them back on another mainboard ([example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY1x8kcYAPI)) or to an adapter that can then fit into a mainboard with a socket. The best adapters to use are [Giga-snaP BGA SMT Adapters](http://www.ironwoodelectronics.com/products/adapters/giga_snap.cfm), used for example in [this project](https://www.tfix.co.uk/portfolio/ps3-cpu-socket-bga-to-pga-installation/). (It is not yet clear if these adapters would fit right into existing CPU sockets like a PGA988.) The bigger problem is, however, that any fitting mainboard will cost more without the CPU than overstock notebook mainboards with CPU, so this solution makes no financial sense.\n\n18. **[Nvidia Jetson TX1 / TX2](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/develop/hardware) (interesting but not adequate here).** These boards are optimized for AI tasks, esp. image classification, through the use of high-performance Nvidia GPUs. At 340 images per second (in AlexNet), performance is impressive, even better than that of a high-end Core i7 desktop CPU ([source](http://hackaday.com/2015/11/10/nvidia-brings-computer-vision-and-deep-learning-to-the-embedded-world/)). Even better, energy use for image classification is about 8 times less than when using a desktop CPU ([source](http://hackaday.com/2015/11/10/nvidia-brings-computer-vision-and-deep-learning-to-the-embedded-world/)). The problem that makes this board unsuitable for our sorter machine is the [steep price of 390 GBP / 450 EUR](http://www.siliconhighwaydirect.co.uk/category-s/1817.htm) for the TX1 developer kit \u2013 ideally the whole sorter will cost less than that, and we surely don't want a mistake by a farmer out there in a village to cause a 450 EUR damage. However, this kind of hardware will get much cheaper over time due to competition, so it is relevant to watch. A bigger issue with NVidia GPUs is, though, that their CUDA software infrastructure for GPGPU computing is not open source. It seems possible to run OpenCL on them though, so there may be open source solutions. Assuming that, there is also the slower but still great [Jetson TK1 board](https://www.siliconhighwaydirect.co.uk/product-p/940-7r375-0001-000.htm) to consider for 140 GBP / 160 EUR. It is built around the Nvidia Tegra K1 GPU, with 290\u2013365 GFLOPS ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tegra#Tegra_K1)). Assuming a medium 330 GFLOPS, that's 0.48 EUR / GFLOPS (confirmed [here](https://rpiplayground.wordpress.com/2014/05/03/hacking-the-gpu-for-fun-and-profit-pt-1/)). However the Raspberry Pi 3 has approx. 38 GFLOPS ([source](https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/faqs/#performanceSpeed)), deduced from the increased clockspeed (400 MHz vs. 250 MHz) and the Raspberry Pi 1's 24 GFLOPS ([source](https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/faqs/#performanceSpeed), [source](https://rpiplayground.wordpress.com/2014/05/03/hacking-the-gpu-for-fun-and-profit-pt-1/)). At a price of 35 USD, that's 0.85 EUR/GFLOPS, or 1.78 times the price per GFLOPS in the Nvidia board. That makes the Raspberry Pi 3 more expensive per GPU GFLOPS, but not by much, and it is still preferable for our purposes here:\n\n    *   Since the RPi 3 also brings a CPU that can be tuned to give about  the same performance for image classification as the GPU, it would rather mean that, with proper software tuning, 5 rather than 9 RPi 3's would give the same performance as the Nvidia board. These cost 162 EUR, compared to the 160 EUR for the NVidia board. It will look even more favourable for the RPi when choosing the RPi Zero board.\n    *   An array of 5 RPi's is more redundant. In a rough environment, that would be a plus, making repairs much cheaper.\n    *   An array of RPi's makes a machine performance scalable. So farmers can invest in more machine processing capacity as their operations grow.\n\n19. **[DIY Conveyor Belt](http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Conveyor-belt/).** An attempt for an open hardware conveyor. Much larger than needed in the coffee sorter, but offers inspirations nonetheless.\n\n\n### 3.5. Accelerating computer vision on the Raspberry Pi <a name=\"chap-3-5\"></a>\n\nSo it seems we are settling on the Raspberry Pi 3 as base hardware to try implementing the optical sorter. Yes, it can do computer vision tasks, but it is a challenge for the little critter :) So, optimization to the rescue \u2013 for which there are many ways, as always. The tips are roughly in a recommended order of execution, based on a \"performance gain for time invested\" metric. A reasonable upper limit of what can be achieved can, in a very rough way, derived from the Raspberry Pi based peanut colour sorter: it achieves 10 items per second on a Raspberry Pi 1 ([source](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288021931)). The Raspberry Pi 3's CPU has approx. ten times the performance, so it may achieve 100 items per second. When also fully utilizing the GPU (which is realistic for all computer vision tasks), it could be 200 items per second, and together with some overclocking and code optimizations probably 250-300 items per second. That is for a pure colour sorter though. If we run deep learning based image classification for at least some beans, as we intend to, achieving even 100 items per second on average will be really good. Now, about the possible optimization measures:\n\n1. **Cooling the Raspberry Pi.** Simple and effective. It is reported somewhere in the [Caltrain project](http://www.svds.com/project/listening-caltrain/) that the RPi will run hot and reduce its clock frequency when running TensorFlow all the time. Effective cooling will keep it at speed. For the Raspberry Pi under a CPU stress test, a small heatsink was all that's needed to keep it at ~70\u00b0C maximum ([source](http://www.geeks3d.com/20160322/tested-raspberry-pi-3-vs-raspberry-pi-2-cpu-and-gpu-benchmarks-burn-in-test/#_3)). For hot environments and esp. when overclocking, a bath of pure ethanol in a closed container may be another option for great heat dissipation \u2026\n\n2. **Overclocking CPU and GPU.** For example, for the original Raspberry Pi 1 GPU, algorithms will run about 40% faster when overclocking it ([source](https://github.com/jetpacapp/DeepBeliefSDK/tree/master#getting-started-on-a-raspberry-pi)). It has to be researched how much overclocking is possible with the Raspberry Pi 3, if anything.\n\n3. **Low-resolution before high-resolution images.** Image classifiers look at input images using small overlapping squares as input elements (e.g. 10\u00d710 px), which makes them much faster for low-resolution images. Major ways to improve speed are, then: (1) do not feed in images in resolutions higher than needed for \"perfect\" sorting and (2) feed in images in a lower resolution first and only if the classifier is not \"sure enough\" if the bean should be rejected, feed in a higher-resolution version.\n\n4. **Colour sorting before neural networks.** To increase performance, it probably works sufficiently well to look at the beans with \"traditional\" computer vision methods first to do colour sorting and only apply convolutional neural networks like TensorFlow when the decision is not clear for a bean yet. Given that the [Raspberry Pi peanut sorter](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288021931) could do 10 peanuts per second, while TensorFlow on Raspberry Pi can do [2 images per second at most](http://svds.com/tensorflow-image-recognition-raspberry-pi/#comment-3166408125), that would be a performance improvement of 400-500%.\n\n5. **Running TensorFlow in C++ only.** With respect to performance of TensorFlow on a RPi, the Caltrain project author publishes [some statistics](https://github.com/samjabrahams/tensorflow-on-raspberry-pi/tree/master/benchmarks/inceptionv3) showing that image classification takes about 2 seconds on a Raspberry Pi 3 for one image, but also [remarks there](https://github.com/samjabrahams/tensorflow-on-raspberry-pi/tree/master/benchmarks/inceptionv3#remarks) that the C++-only TensorFlow benchmark tool achieves 0.5-0.6 s runtimes on a RPi 3\\. They say it is not yet clear if all of this difference is due to the communication between Python and the C++ core, but it could be.\n\n6. **Also use the Raspberry Pi's GPU.** The RPI's GPU contains 12 parallel so-called QPUs ([source](https://github.com/mn416/QPULib#background)). On the Raspberry Pi 1, these enabled image classification with DeepBelief in 5 seconds per frame, or in 3 seconds with an overclocked GPU ([source](https://github.com/jetpacapp/DeepBeliefSDK/tree/master#getting-started-on-a-raspberry-pi)), which  is several times faster than the Raspberry Pi 1's CPU. However the CPU of the Raspberry Pi 2 is even more powerful due to the vectoring instructions of the new ARM NEON instruction set, resulting in 3.2 second per frame without overclocking ([source](https://petewarden.com/2015/05/10/image-recognition-on-the-raspberry-pi-2/)). We can expect the Raspberry Pi 3 to be 1.33 times that speed due to higher clock speed (1.2 GHz vs. 900 MHz) and (hopefully) again 2 times that speed due to a wider bus (64 bit vs. 32 bit). So in total, 2.66 times as fast as a Raspberry Pi 2, achieving one image classification with DeepBelief in 1.2 seconds. Now the GPU will be roughly as powerful, as it was in the Raspberry Pi 2, so on average one DeepBelief image classification would happen every 0.6 seconds without overclocking. About practical solutions to utilize the Raspberry Pi's GPU: This has been a difficult topic for years, but when [Broadcom released the full VideoCore IV specs](https://www.golem.de/news/raspberry-pi-broadcom-gibt-dokumente-zum-grafikkern-frei-1403-104877.html) in March 2014, the open source community was able to come up with solutions. Seemingly all are based on so-called VideoCore IV \"user shaders\", which are programs to run on one of the GPU's 12 QPUs and issued to these by giving start addresses of the instructions and data ([source](https://books.google.de/books?id=mU5ICgAAQBAJ&pg=PA425&lpg=PA425&dq=raspberry+gpu+opencl&source=bl&ots=Fa2GZMj4k2&sig=m84jwq1IJfUZIM6z3saFr9NR-a0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj2vcbdm-vSAhXhDpoKHcEMD2MQ6AEIezAO#v=onepage&q=raspberry%20gpu%20opencl&f=false)). In terms of software frameworks to control them, we have [multiple options](http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/q/41) now. The most relevant seem to be:\n\n    * [QPULib](https://github.com/mn416/QPULib#background)\n    * [accelerated FFT on the RPi GPU](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/accelerating-fourier-transforms-using-the-gpu/) (faster by a factor of 10!)\n    * [various examples of GPGPU hacking on the RPi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/gpgpu-hacking-on-the-pi/)\n    * full [OpenCL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCL) is not yet supported, although there is an [experimental version](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=78919)\n\n7. **Running multiple RPis in parallel.** If necessary, there would be multiple Raspberry Pi's processing pictures of one bean each while the respective bean is in a waiting position on a conveyor, rotating disk or similar. If pictures can be taken at  rate of 30 per second (not a problem with video cameras!) and processing them takes a Raspberry two seconds for one bean, then with 60 Raspberry Pi Zero's (60 \u00d7 5 USD = 300 USD if you get  them), a throughput of 30 beans per second would be possible. That's 18.5 kg per hour or 161 tons per year. Even better, the machine can be scaled up to higher capacities by simply adding more Raspberry Pi's, without needing to change the mechanics.\n\n8. **Using faster neural network algorithms.** For example, it is [reported](https://www.nervanasys.com/winograd-2/) that one can easily achieve a practical speedup of factor 2 (and theoretically up to 4) with the Winograd algorithm. That report also says that in some cases a FFT based algorithm is even faster, and for that there is a [GPU based implementation on the RPi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/accelerating-fourier-transforms-using-the-gpu/), faster by a factor of 10 compared to the CPU version.\n\n\n### 3.6. Programming language <a name=\"chap-3-6\"></a>\n\n**So far, our plan is to use:**\n\n* **Python** for all glue code / high level code running on the coffee sorter, and all scripts for managing data and training outside of the machine. Also for all machine control code, given that our current motor controller board [Adafruit 2348](https://adafru.it/2348) comes with [a python library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Motor-HAT-Python-Library) but no C / C++ library is readily available. We can create our own C / C++ library later, but a (slower running) version of the machine is already possible with the Python library. So we can consider the C / C++ extension as \"optimization\", and optimization always has to come last \u2026\n\n* **C or C++ for a Python extension** that provides \"driver-like\" features to control the machine, and also deals with all the time-critical realtime code (for ejecting beans etc.). Extensions can be written both in C and C++ ([see](https://docs.python.org/2/extending/extending.html#writing-extensions-in-c)). For the coffee sorter, this extension could provide access to a C / C++ library, which runs its own realtime process or thread, ideally on a dedicated CPU core. Jobs would be supplied via the extension interface to the realtime process well in advance, and the realtime process would guarantee timely execution of belt movement, bean ejection etc..\n\n* **Python or C / C++** for all libraries. Python is acceptable for small libraries for which functional replacements can easily be found in other programming languages, while major functionality should come as C / C++ libraries (example: [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)). This way, the same library code can be used when somebody wants to port the software to other programming languages, given that C / C++ libraries can be accessed from most dynamic languages via extensions of language bindings. In addition, low-level libraries for access to kernel drivers (such as I2C) should be in C / C++, as they will be needed by the other machine-control code in the Python C extensions. This is not a problem with the Raspberry Pi, as this seems to be how it is done already; see for example [WiringPi](http://wiringpi.com/), the interface library for the SPI and I2C buses.\n\n**Advantages of this setup over alternatives:**\n\n* **Popular.** To make it simple for people to contribute, the chosen programming language should be widespread. This is the case for both C / C++ ([TIOBE rank](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) 2 and 3 in 2018-02) and Python (TIOBE rank 4, and the most popular dynamic language).\n\n* **Beginner friendly.** Python is a favorite language for people beginning programming, and in that role it is also the standard programming language in the Raspberry Pi ecosystem. So if we want to make modifying the coffee sorter as simple as possible for coffee farmers resp. developers and small startups close to them, P\n\n* **It's standard Python.** With other ways to speed up Python, often language extensions and a different toolchain are employed. For example, Cython is a static Python-to-C compiler. The biggest speedups are only possible when adding static typing hints \u2013 which, then, is no longer standard Python, and the toolchain is also different. All of this makes the code less accessible for novice programmers. That is not an issue when speed-critical code is distributed as Python extensions, for example in the form of Raspbian packages.\n\n* **Speed.** It does no get much faster than using C for speed-critical parts. (Apart from the GPU utilization challenges on the Raspberry Pi for our special usecase, of course.) The split between two languages to have both speed and ease of use is also done in other, large scale software, notably Tensorflow (48% C++, 41% Python [according to Github](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)).\n\n* **Re-usable in other languages.** The concept of C / C++ extensions for dynamic languages like Python is relatively common. Ruby, PHP etc. support the same thing, and other languages at least allow cross-language bindings to C / C++ libraries. It is possible to re-use the same C code to create extensions or library bindings for these other languages as well, making it simple for people to take control of the machine with scripts. They might come up with interesting alternative uses in their \"own\" programming languages (sorting nuts or beans, sorting pebbles or rocks, sorting shredded plastic particles, grading grain samples etc.). For this reason, proving \"proper\" C code rather than auto-generated C code via Cython seems preferable, even if the speed is nearly the same.\n\n**Future speedup options:**\n\nIn addition to the C extensions, there are other ways to speed up Python code. Pretty surely, these will not be needed as all time-critical code will be concentrated in the C extensions. However if we need an additional way, it should speed up the Python code while keeping it beginner-friendly, standard Python. Options include (the most appropriate first):\n\n* **Cython with preprocessor.** [Cython](http://cython.org/) is a static Python-to-C compiler, but to fully use its speedup options one should add [static C type hints](http://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/quickstart/cythonize.html) to time critical code. To keep the code still \"standard Python\", we would put the Cython static type hints into preprocessor directives. They could for example look like a commented-out derivative of the previous line of standard Python code. This keeps all the normal code to be standard Python code, and it can be executed the standard way by CPython. We then use a custom Python to Cython preprocessor in order to create the higher-speed \"compiled python\" versions.\n\n    We would not use any other Cython special features, such as calling C code from within Python. These features do not have a direct (just slower) equivalent in Python code, so our approach to \"keep Cython optional\" is impossible when using these features.\n\n    An additional benefit is that the whole software can be compiled into a single executable ([see](https://stackoverflow.com/a/22513682)). This executable still links to / includes the Python interpreter, which still handles all the dynamic typing cases.\n\n* **PyPy.** It indeed does run on the Raspberry Pi 3 (ARM v7 platform). However, all Python extensions need to be made compatible with PyPy to be able to use them there ([see](https://stackoverflow.com/a/18946824)). And since we want to access several large C / C++ libraries from the Raspberry Pi and even create our own, Cython seems to be less overhead for our usecase. In addition, the speed gains specifically on the Raspberry Pi seem to be negligible in most cases, and in some cases it is even slower ([see](http://rpitips.com/python-and-pypy-on-raspberry-pi-1-nad-2-benchmarks/)).\n\n* **Nuitka.** Nuitka ([homepage](http://nuitka.net/) and [code](https://github.com/kayhayen/Nuitka)) is a Python-to-C compiler that can work with the whole of the Python language, but it is (so far) not really optimized for speed ([details](https://stackoverflow.com/q/47992232)). This [shows in the benchmarks](https://pybenchmarks.org/u64q/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=nuitka&lang2=python3&data=u64q), where Nuitka is simply comparable in speed to CPython (the standard interpreter).\n\n\n### 3.7. Imaging setup <a name=\"chap-3-7\"></a>\n\nObviously we need a camera and a setup to reliably and automatically create in-focus raster images of individual coffee beans, with reliably good lighting conditions (esp., no shadows).\n\n**Basic options:**\n\n1. **Multiple beans per frame with a lower-speed camera.** The camera could be a \"normal\" webcam (25-30 fps) or even a still camera (<5fps), both of which are cheap and abundantly available. In each case, the camera could simply capture a few beans when they begin their travel on the fast conveyor.\n\n    We have to capture images in such a way that we can discard portions at the image edges with \"half beans\" because the same beans will appear in other images fully. For that, we can:\n\n    * capture a frame covering one average bean distance (about 3 bean lengths in our machine), then a new frame after the conveyor moved by half that distance\n    * capture a frame covering a longer distance (3-8 bean distances), then again move the frame by \"frame length minus half a bean distance\". This option has less overhead in terms of finding which parts of an image contains half beans (so has to be discarded), as more fully depicted beans are contained.\n\n2. **One bean per frame with a high-speed camera.** At a target throughput of 100 beans per second, this requires 100 fps. High-framerate cameras have lower resolutions, but this is not a limitation in this case. For example, the official Raspberry Pi camera module v1 can do 90 fps at 640\u00d7480 px, while ca. 150\u00d7150 px per bean is sufficient to visually detect bean quality. Compare the following 150\u00d7150 px image of a coffee bean from Hansapur, Nepal:\n\n    <img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/8/8a0edf6d0dfe5ee38c6f8ddcdfa777e0ce939c07.jpg\" width=\"244\" height=\"244\">\n\n    When using a high-speed camera, we do not have to prepare and transfer pixel data (of half beans at the edges, redundantly photographed beans etc.) uselessly, saving CPU time. In addition, if we are able to capture one frame per bean, we do not have to spend CPU time of cutting out small images of individual beans from a larger image, again saving CPU time. So this solution is our targeted solution, but we have to solve how to know the position of a coffee bean to take a picture when it is in the center of the image. Solution options:\n\n    * **Stitch and split images.** We would capture a frame that is only as wide as the conveyor using a high-speed camera, then move the conveyor by one frame length, then capture another frame etc.. All frames are merged into a longer image, and split again by bean while also calculating the position of each bean on the conveyor. This seems to be a bad idea, because (1) we would spend time on object detection in these images, (2) stitching images together is never really precise due to lens distortions (as everyone knows from panorama photography), and in our case additionally because beans might change their position relative to the conveyor belt due to vibration etc..\n\n    * **Conveyor with buckets.** We could use a non-flat conveyor, with small buckets to fix the positions for the beans, but that seems less preferable as it makes the conveyor into a special part that is complex / more costly to produce. The buckets would need open side walls so the same lateral ejector mechanism from above can be used, and we would need a feedback destination gate with a conveyor to re-process beans in cases where multiple beans made it to one bucket. In total, this seems more costly for building the product, so we do not choose this alternative.\n\n    * **Light barrier.** A small laser diode lighting across the conveyor, very narrowly above the belt. A bean will block the way of the light when moving across, signaling to the Raspberry Pi to take the next image. (Or more practically, to evaluate the next frame taken by the high-speed camera in video mode.) The laser diode will have to be switched off while the picture is taken, or a wavelength has to be used that is invisible to the camera sensor. The laser diode can be controlled with the same control board used to control the solenoids.\n\nOut of these options, capturing a single low-resolution frame of one coffee bean from the top, using a high-speed camera, and triggering this with a light barrier seems the option that requires the least processing time on the Raspberry Pi computer, so we intend to choose this. Also compared to multiple beans per image, the imaging setup (view angle and lighting) is much more identical between beans, simplifying the task for the decision algorithm.\n\n\n### 3.8. Raspberry Pi camera options <a name=\"chap-3-8\"></a>\n\nLooking at hardware options specifically for the Raspberry Pi 3:\n\n1. **USB cameras.** These are typically UVC devices (USB Video Class, an interface standard), so they all work with the same open source driver under Linux. UVC \"webcam style\" devices with USB 2.0 interface (for the Raspberry Pi) are available with high frame rates, for example the [Kayeton KYT-U400](http://www.kayetoncctv.com/product/4-0megapixel-high-speed-high-fram-rate-120fps-720p-ov4689-uvc-full-hd-1080p-usb-camera-module-for-android-linux-windows-mac/) can provide 640\u00d7360 px at 330 fps (while we only need 150\u00d7150 px at 100 fps). A problem with USB cameras can be that the internal postprocessing makes the image too blurry for our purposes, usually without a way to influence it. However, some USB cameras provide access to the raw image data, such as the Leopard Imaging MT9M021C ([source](https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/970330/how-to-handle-raw-from-usb-cameras/?offset=2)).\n\n2. **Official camera module.** Widely available and relatively cheap (ca. 26 USD, [see](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01ER2SKFS)). However, it is not fully open source since the interface to the GPU for postprocessing is used under a NDA agreement by the Raspberry Pi foundation for developing their driver. We would have the same issue in a USB webcam, as it does the postprocessing internally, but at least it does not come with a vendor lock-in as the one-and-only official Raspberry Pi camera module, and we can treat it as a black box that at least provides an open source interface to the outside (UVC, typically). An advantage of the Raspberry Pi camera module is that it allows access to the raw image data via [raspiraw](https://github.com/illes/raspiraw), and that means [indeed the raw sensor values](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=44918&start=50). This allows  even faster framerates than 90 fps, and also more control over the image postprocessing ([examples here](http://bealecorner.org/best/RPi/)).\n\n3. **Other cameras with DSI interface.** The official Raspberry Pi camera module interfaces to the Raspberry with a DSI interface, and other cameras are available that provide this interface. However, a driver has to be written, and the exact specifications are usually not available. So far, it seems that no other DSI camera has been made to work with the Raspberry Pi.\n\n4. **Smartphone cameras.** This is just an idea for now, and probably more limited in speed than the above options. However, smartphone cameras are pretty good and pretty cheap \u2013 in fact, as most farmers will have a smartphone in the family, it would come at no additional cost. The concerned person will not need it overnight when the sorter is doing its work :-) The prohibitive issue will probably be connecting the smartphone camera, as it may require installing a special application to the phone etc..\n\n\n### 3.9. Realtime requirements <a name=\"chap-3-9\"></a>\n\nWe made a first rough estimation of the realtime requirements of the linear solenoids (our \"bean ejectors\") to see what tool we will need for that job: just the Raspberry Pi, or a master/slave combination of Raspberry Pi and Arduino (which is much better at meeting realtime requirements).\n\nAssuming 10.8 km/h conveyor speed and one bean every 30 mm (on average) as above, we want to use a 20 mm long ejector bar to move the bean rectangular to the conveyor. At a bean length of 10 mm, this leaves a tolerance of 10 mm way of travel during which we can safely eject the bean. \n\nNow at 10.8 km/h, a bean travels these 10 mm in:\n\n10 mm / (10.8 km/h) = 10 mm / (10,800,000 mm / 3600 s) = 3.33 ms\n\nThis is not too difficult to do with the Raspberry Pi 3, as this system has a latency of ~220 \u00b5s when running a realtime Linux kernel under load ([see](https://www.osadl.org/Latency-plot-of-system-in-rack-b-slot.qa-latencyplot-rbs3.0.html)) or about 500 \u00b5s = 0.5 ms when running a stock Linux kernel ([see](https://medium.com/@metebalci/2d9c20704495)). Means it will execute an ejection with a precision of 220 \u00b5s resp. 500 \u00b5s, well within our requirements of 3.33 ms = 3330 \u00b5s.\n\nWe had however the following other ideas to deal with the realtime requirements, if needed:\n\n* Let a small realtime microcontroller (Arduino based) control the linear solenoids. It would receive a set of timed instructions for future movements from the Raspberry Pi whenever it finds time to send those, and execute them in hard realtime manner.\n\n* Make the distances between beans on the conveyor belts large enough, and the ejector wide enough, as this increases the tolerance of when an action has to happen to be successful. (That is, it decreases the realtime requirements.)\n\n* Let the conveyor belts run slow enough for the Raspberry Pi to be able to eject beans properly within the realtime requirements it is able to meet (which would be \"\u00b1 7 ms\" or some other number).\nSerialize the transport and ejection actions. For that, modify the mechanical design so that beans are moved around in fixed positions (\"small buckets\"), and use a design that starts and stops the conveyor for each bean movement. It will start moving again only after all required actions for moving / ejecting a bean are executed. (However, this seems to be the least useful alternative, as it would put strain on the mechanics through constant start / stop actions, and be severely limited in speed (probably <10 beans per second).)\n\n\n### 3.10. Motor speed and torque requirements <a name=\"chap-3-10\"></a>\n\nStill to be determined. Note that there is a relationship between them: with increasing speed, the torque that the motor can deliver decreases (this makes sense, as load slows a motor down \u2026). Example diagrams [here](http://www.eminebea.com/en/product/rotary/steppingmotor/hybrid/standard/14py-z.shtml), also available for [many similar models](http://www.eminebea.com/en/product/rotary/steppingmotor/hybrid/standard/).\n\n\n### 3.11. Prototype manufacturing <a name=\"chap-3-11\"></a>\n\nAll custom-made parts of the machine will require a CNC router (and nothing else) to be manufactured. The design can be modified easily to instead use a lasercutter.\n\n\n### 3.12. Lighting setup <a name=\"chap-3-12\"></a>\n\nWe intend to use a cool white LED lighting strip as our light source. This seems to be the most appropriate \"cheap\" lighting option, offering the following advantages over alternative solutions:\n\n1. **Allows flashing.** Flashing is good as it allows to capture sharp images of beans in motion. Other lighting such as halogen do not allow flashing the lighting source, so would need a more complex setup of a light valve (LCD screen or mechanical) to allow flashing.\n\n2. **Low energy consumption.** Not a main reason, but low energy consumption and accordingly low waste heat allows for a compact, simple and cheap machine, with a cheaper AC adapter etc.. It also simplifies direct operation from photovoltaics. Note also that white LEDs are more energy efficient than trying to produce the same amount of white light with RGB LEDs ([source](http://www.candlepowerforums.com/vb/showthread.php?225839-CRI-and-efficacy-of-RGB-arrays-versus-white-LEDs&s=696f39084651e4b09222ebe6726614cd&p=2877504&viewfull=1#post2877504)).\n\n3. **Cool white is closer to sunlight.** The color temperature itself is not relevant for color accuracy: colors will appear visually different, but are still all different from each other, so they can be told apart. Technically, color temperature can be thought of as the inclination of the line-shaped graph in an intensity vs. wavelength diagram. See the following example (from the [LED lighting database](http://indiecinemaacademy.com/complete-led-color-database-cri-tlci-cqs-tm30-15/)):\n\n    <img src=\"http://indiecinemaacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/STANDARDS-tungsten-daylight-sm.jpg\">\n\n    However, color temperature correction is yet another image processing step (if we chose to normalize colors, see below), and by choosing a color temperature close to daylight (the \"standard color temperature\"), we can avoid this step and the associated CPU time.\n\n4. **Better color rendering than RGB LEDs.** White LEDs are actually blue LEDs with a phosphor coating that spreads the spectrum or emitted light to more or less the whole visible spectrum. (In some photography applications they are used separately: blue LEDs and exchangeable \"[remote phosphors](https://uk.rs-online.com/web/c/displays-optoelectronics/led-lighting-system-components/remote-phosphor-components/?sra=p&amp;amp;r=t)\".) Whereas RGB LEDs have three LED colors emitting in a narrow frequency band each, with the result that a lot of colors cannot be discerned under this lighting. For a detailed explanation, see [this brilliant article](http://www.jands.com.au/support/product-support/lighting-technical-materials/what-to-look-for-when-judging-an-led-fixture146s-colour-mixing-capabilities133). It refers to LED lighting fixtures of filmmakers, which can achieve good color mixing abilities, but are also much more expensive than a cheap RGB lighting strip.\n\nThe color accuracy of our setup (lighting and camera) can be significantly improved by image post-processing. This is not relevant for machines that use a completely identical setup for both lighting and camera, as that should produce sufficiently identical images for the algorithm to work without re-tuning / re-training. However, this also creates a sort of \"vendor lock-in\", so using image processing to \"normalize\" the colors in an image before running the decision algorithm is a better long-term alternative. \n\nAffordable tools to normalize the colors produced by a machine include:\n\n* **Choosing a color accurate LED.** These exist and are not necessarily expensive, and avoid the need for much correction through post-processing (which, anyway, cannot invent data when light frequencies are missing from the source). See the [LED database](http://indiecinemaacademy.com/complete-led-color-database-cri-tlci-cqs-tm30-15/) for good options. What measure to use for color accuracy in LEDs is still a matter of discussion \u2013 the old \"color rendering index\" (CRI) seems to be not enough. For an introduction to this topic, see [here](https://books.google.co.ma/books?id=kDcdAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA63&lpg=PA63&dq=cri+correction&source=bl&ots=N2PzI4sAQ0&sig=pN15P0KursKg5B9HmYpkTnIbJgQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiosqqT4tLZAhWhCMAKHfMDCGcQ6AEIXjAK#v=onepage&q=cri%20correction&f=false), [here](http://indiecinemaacademy.com/is-cri-relevant-in-an-led-world/) and [here](https://www.flexfireleds.com/color-rendering-index-cri-and-led-lighting-what-is-cri/).\n\n* **Color correction with RGB curves.** Since cameras record in three independent channels per pixel (red, green, blue), we can also do the color correction independently per channel. Most image processing software (such as GIMP) has a feature for color adjustment with curves for three channels (red, green, blue). These create mappings (functions) for the source values 0\u2026255 to target values 0\u2026255 in any way, allowing to \"normalize\" any colors. It is similar to contrast spreading and contrast compression, but for three channels instead of one and segment by segment for each channel. With this mapping, it should be possible to normalize photos taken under any lighting conditions. But of course no miracles can be expected: if a certain wavelength is not present at all in the lighting source, its effect on the image cannot be simulated / determined from existing data.\n\n* **Calibration with X-RITE ColorChecker.** For proper color correction, we need a way to know how the colors _should_ look in the camera images; the simplest way is photographing a color reference chart and comparing the RGB pixel values produced with the reference values associated with a certain color patch in a certain RGB color space. The [original ColorChecker](https://www.xrite.com/categories/calibration-profiling/colorchecker-passport-photo?ID=820) is a small color calibration card. See also [Wikipedia about it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ColorChecker). It is [used in camera testing](https://www.cnet.com/how-we-test-cameras/) processes and to [calibrate colors in RAW images](https://books.google.co.ma/books?id=uBJWxM-JnbIC&pg=PT176&lpg=PT176&dq=rgb+color+reference+card&source=bl&ots=aPfwZYoXDl&sig=NhwBdtRrZncrt6oegxm2RdXsynE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwim7Y3f8tLZAhXlDsAKHcIbA6MQ6AEItQEwDg#v=onepage&q=rgb%20color%20reference%20card&f=false) of digital cameras, for example. In our case, the full color checker card will not even fit below the camera on the conveyor belt, allowing to cut the card and produce multiple ones from small snippets of each color patch. Making 16 cards out of one should be possible, and makes the original card affordable for machine producers and / or owners. Each machine might come with one of these small ColorChecker cards, so owners can re-calibrate their machine after they exchanged the camera and / or lighting parts.\n\n* **Calibration with Third-Party ColorChecker cards.** There are much cheaper versions available from Chinese manufacturers ([see](https://www.ebay.de/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2380057.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.H0.Xcolorchecker.TRS0&_nkw=colorchecker&_sacat=0)). These will probably not be as accurate between batches / manufacturers as the original from X-RITE, but probably accurate enough within the same batch. And buying a large amount of them for different production places will be an afforable option in this case. Another way is to calibrate these cards themselves (= determine the color correction parameters to use) by comparing it with a \"master\" card in a central location. Since these cards can be sent around by letter, distributing them to the various points of manufacture and / or machine owners will be possible.\n\n* **Calibration with X-RITE Color Checker Digital SG.** See [here](https://www.xrite.com/categories/calibration-profiling/colorchecker-digital-sg). This product has 140 color patches and is meant for automated calibration of cameras and scanners. However, it is rather expensive (ca. 370 USD).\n\n\n### 4. Machine design <a name=\"chap-4\"></a>\n\nYou can find a draft design for version 1.0 of the coffee sorter, and a discussion about it, in this topic:\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/open-source-coffee-sorter-version-1-0/8086\n\n\n\n## 5. Production and sale <a name=\"chap-5\"></a>\n\nAfter the initial development, the machine should be mass-produced and marketed to small-scale coffee farmers around the world for <300 USD. It will relieve them of the manual work of sorting the coffee, esp. the women as they do ~80% of that work now. And it will allow them to achieve better quality coffee than by hand-sorting, and better prices for that.\n\nProducing the machine, on the other hand, is a business opportunity for several small manufacturing startups, since the design is open source and optimized for production in a small-scale workshop (with either a CNC router or lasercutter, but no specialized tools apart from that). The machine can be produced anywhere and marketed and shipped inside the country or even worldwide (because it is unique, and at <5 kg light enough for making parcel shipment economical). It is also small enough to be shipped as checked-in baggage when travelling by air, and nicely fits into a [Euro container](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro_container) for protection during such transports.\n\n\n## 6. Ideas for further development <a name=\"chap-6\"></a>\n\n1. **Two identical conveyors.** It seems possible to make the two conveyor assemblies completely identical, only driving them at different speeds by software. Using identical parts provides redundancy (between multiple machines) and also means fewer spare parts, better bulk discounts for purchasing higher numbers of identical parts, and lower production costs for custom parts.\n\n2. **Cost reduction by using GPIO pins instead of a relay control board.** There are small, cheap relay boards that use one GPIO pin per relay channel. So for three output bins we need three of the Raspberry Pi's 17 unassigned GPIO pins. (Note that in the current design, a motor controller board is used to control the linear solenoids, but it is of similar cost  to a relay board.)\n\n3. **Cost reduction by using PWM pins instead of a DC motor control board.** The Raspberry Pi has two independent PWM pins ([source](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=150254)), enough to control the speed of two DC motors independently. These PWM outputs are used for the Raspberry Pi's audio output, but since we do not need audio it's not an issue to use them for other purposes.\n\n4. **Current limiting by using the PWM feature of the motor control board.** This may or may not work, and is definitely a hack. However: our [Adafruit 2348 Motor HAT](https://adafru.it/2348) has a PWM feature (used for both microstepping and DC motor control), and for another motor controller built around a similar chip (TB6612FNG rather than TB6612) this was used to provide current limiting: \"In particular this motor is very well matched to the Sparkfun motor driver, Dual TB6612FNG , That\u2019s where the low Vcc of the dual motor control makes it perfect. Its PWM feature helps provide energy efficient current limiting if you are running on a 3 V battery.\" [[source](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10551)].\n\n5. **Combine relay and motor control on a custom board.** This would use relay control via GPIO pins and motor control via PWM pins, as discussed above. The advantage would be the lower cost of board components (probably <10 USD), compared to the 43 - 50 USD total for the two motor control boards we use currently. However, creating a custom board introduces additional complexity into the machine design, production and stock-keeping for spare parts, and needs additional manual worktime during the production. In addition, we lose the mutual redundancy of the DC motor control boards (if one fails in the current design, the machine can still function with one output bin less, i.e. with 3 bins in total). So we are not yet sure if it is a good idea at all to create a custom board, but it is an idea. If shipping I2C motor control and relay boards to a country for machine production is more difficult than creating a custom board there, the idea makes sense.\n\n6. **Direct photovoltaics power.** For the most remote areas with no reliable electricity connection, there is a simple way to let the machine run directly on photovoltaics power. The machine would come with one 40 - 50 W photovoltaics panel (which has the same footprint as the machine, fitting with it into a 60\u00d740 cm Eurobox. The machine will also contain a supercapacitor for short-term energy storage, and a DC-DC converter to supply stable 5 V output to the machine from the variable output of the supercapacitor. If the energy in the supercap is running low, the machine will also run slower, to not use more than the sun can supply currently. If the machine runs out of power, it will power up at the same point and proceed. Adding a supercap might be a good idea anyway to lower the current rating requirement of the AC adaptor.\n\n7. **Feedback output channel.** It would allow feeding individual beans back onto the fast conveyor, in a way so that the machine knows the identity of the bean when it comes across it again and thus can compare it with previous data about the bean. This gives additional options for the programming, for example \"look at the bean as many times as needed to know what type it is with sufficient probability\".\n\n8. **Parametric design for different materials and machines.** Ideally, the final 2D vector shapes to use as input for a machine would be generated by a script after specifying material thickness and machine type (CNC router or lasercutter) and any machine parameters necessary (router bit diameter). This allows to manufacture the machine efficiently with a wider range of tools and materials, making it more adapted to local settings.\n\n9. **Reversible conveyor for a closer look.** Speed requirement require to use the hardware accelerated image processing of the camera (partially happening in the GPU when using the Raspberry Pi official camera module). That results in reading de-bayed \"ready-made\" images being read from the camera. However, when the software finds that it cannot properly decide of what category a bean is, it may be a good idea to move the conveyor backwards and take a picture in RAW mode, then doing a (slower) processing in custom code. The advantage is that RAW images (1) can provide more details since the de-bayer step is not yet done and (2) can cover a larger color space than standard sRGB (and that larger color space can even include near infrared when removing lens filters).\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;To be able to inspect all beans more closely, it must be possible to move a bean back from its most advanced position at the end of the conveyor. Beans put on the conveyor after it will have to be moved back as well, so the conveyor has to be approximately twice as long as the normal travel distance of beans. Beans would fall on the conveyor in the center and move to one end, except in cases when the conveyor is reversed.\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;The question is of course if it makes any economic sense to reverse the conveyor \"just because of one bean\". Reserving one output bin for \"undecidable beans\" and then having a closer look at all of them in a second run with different parameters is probably faster and does not add much more complexity to the process / machine handling.\n\n10. **Mirror optics.** This can be combined with both imaging setups discussed above. With multiple beans per frame, to fill the 4:3 or 16:9 frame better) we could make the camera see a longer part of the conveyor in multiple rows, using some mirror optics. In this case, 45\u00b0 mirror walls to the left and right of the conveyor would do the job. When capturing images from the top, we will see three rows of beans, covering three sides of the bean. For a high-precision sorting program, we can (nearly) cover two more sides by creating an image of the same bean once when it enters the image frame (\"from the front\") and once when it leaved the image frame (\"from the back\"). Still, only one camera is used, so the solutions keeps being cheap. Similarly, mirror optics (even from four sides) can be used when capturing an image of an individual bean from the top.\n\n11. **Conveyor speed adjustment.** Coffee beans are effectively \"parked\" on the conveyor belt while image processing takes place. So when capturing a frame with multiple beans, processing has to start with the bean that has traveled the most already, and has to be finished for each bean when that bean gets past the first solenoid that could drop it off the conveyor. In case the processing is not as fast as expected, both conveyors would be slowed down, or even stopped in the worst case. Compared to the alternative of running the conveyor at a constant but slower speed, this optimization can increase the throughput.\n\n12. **Initially, use only colour sorting and manual sorting of rejects.** Currently, nearly all smallholder coffee is manually picked. The first version of the optical sorter could be a pure colour sorter that is \"trigger happy\" to sort beans out, because this would require the least development effort (no AI software, no perfect colour sorting needed either). It would result in a lot of false positives, and people would sort through these manually like right now. If, for example, the machine would sort out 10% of the beans for manual picking, it still means lowering the workload of manual picking by 90%. So even such a simple machine would make economic sense for farmers.\n\n13. **Using the sorter for grading coffee.** One of the best additional uses for an optical sorter is for grading coffee samples by quality, for example according to the SCAA scheme. This is essential in trading any coffee, but mostly for specialty coffees, as the smaller lots mean more grading to be done, so automating it is more important. This usage could really fund the development of the machine via crowdfunding by small coffee roasters and traders. A cheap but precise low-throughput sorter is ideal for this. The only difference is that the machine should ideally have more than two bins in order to sort the defective beans by kind. This makes it simpler to double-check the results manually.\n\n14. **Innovative flavour sortings.** With a machine combining a precision scales, detailed imaging and AI image classification, much more precise sorting of coffee is possible than currently. This allows some innovative uses by finding out new measurable criteria that affect taste, and sort beans accordingly to create even better-tasting coffee. For example, one could sort out the densest beans as characterized by a mostly closed central groove in the coffee bean. This is a use of the machine for specialty coffee roasters and traders, and may help to fund the development of the machine through a crowdfunding.\n\n15. **Sorting fresh cherries.** The machine should also be able to sort fresh coffee cherries. This can replace floating the coffee (separating and discarding unripe and damaged coffee cherries because they float in water). It may even be way more accurate, allowing to create better quality coffees.\n\n16. **Sorting parchment coffee.** The machine should also be able to sort parchment coffee. This is a new processing step that may for example help to reduce aflatoxin loads by discarding beans where the parchment shell has black spots, while the bean may still be visually unaffected.\n\n17. **Other uses.** This machine is primarily for coffee, but should also be applicable or adaptable for sorting all kinds of small items, like grains, nuts, grapes etc.. It should also be adaptable to sorting plastic chips by type and color, and for other non-agricultural uses. A similar machine [for trash sorting and recycling](https://greenmachine.com/waste-recycling-systems/optical-sorting/), similarly low-cost to be applicable in developing regions, would be very helpful there.\n\n18. **Integrated training mode.** With an attached computer, humans would classify high-resolution images of coffee beans, and mark defects where applicable. These are then used as training set for further training of the neural network, which means this method would use \"deep learning\". See the video on [this page](http://www.rsipvision.com/grading-and-sorting/) for an example of a machine utilizing this method with oranges.\n\n19. **Passive solar operation.** The machine should be able to operate passively on photovoltaics power (without batteries, only with a small supercap as buffer).\n\n20. **Use a transparent conveyor belt.** This allows making images from top and bottom without moving the object. If needed the belt would have open glass vessels or flat glass pieces as inserts, with a flat bottom.\n\n21. **Using a \"map image\" as computer vision input.** It is probably a good idea to transform whatever images the cameras record into a map representation of a coffee bean, and feed that into the color sorter algorithm, image classification algorithm etc.. Perhaps there is even an image format to represent spherical objects without distortion (probably used for 360\u00b0 images, just that here we'd use it \"inverted\").\n\n22. **Maybe use a belt and a scanner CCD above it for imaging.** A scanner CCD is typically 21 cm wide, allowing 20 parallel lanes on a belt for imaging coffee beans. Which makes this a very cheap, high-resolution, high-throughput image acquisition method. Obviously it will be a challenge to develop a totally smooth moving belt and to hack the scanner electronics for continuous operation (but just stopping the belt for a time to start a new \"virtual page\" would also do). Performance would be (say) 20\u00d725 beans = 500 beans scanned in 20 s at 300 dpi, so 500 beans / 20 s = 25 beans/s. That is also easily achievable with serial imaging using a single video camera with a 25 fps framerate, so it's probably not worth the effort.\n\n23. **Stop-and-go conveyor.** Conveyors that can be started and stopped immediately and without causing more wear and tear in the machine make programming it much simpler and more flexible. Because essentially, all steps are sequential, avoiding all the issues with realtime requirements listed above. This is however only true is the stepper motors driving the belt can be started and stopped immediately. If it has too high momentum (speed and / or mass), it needs to start and stop with speed ramps, which again introduce realtime requirements as the momentum will make the stepper motor jump over steps that are not signaled in time (\"missed steps\", resulting in a confused machine state). Immediate stop-and-go should be achievable with a very lightweight conveyor, small-ish belt rollers, and stepper motors with high holding torque.\n\n24. **Bottom imaging.** Instead of double-picking or triple-picking to see the beans from all sides with a sufficiently high probability, the machine could include a mechanism that guaranteeing that. It could either flip the bean when it is passed to another conveyor, or (simpler) use a fully transparent conveyor so that the beans can be photographed from the bottom, using an upward-facing camera between the upper and lower conveyor belts. In this case, it will also need a brush or small rotating brush removing dust and debris from the underside of the conveyor, shortly after the belt turned around at the end of the conveyor.\n\n25. **Mechanical coffee sorter.** This would be an interesting, much more low-tech design. It needs electronics and imaging, but stepper motors and linear actuators, and the controller board for all of these would be replaced by a mechanical mechanism as found in a hall clock where the energy is supplied by a raised mass. The remaining electronics would use simple, low-powered linear actuators with a 2 mm way of action to hook in or release hooks into gears, that way releasing or locking the movement of both the conveyors and the bean ejector. The bean ejector could be a kind of spring-supported pendulum.\n\n\n## 7.

As he is a full-time Content creation Manager at Ma3an Project of FHI 360\u00b0, a USAID funded project, he could not attend all the labs.\nYasser's feedback on the labs he attended is that the content is accessible and not confusing jargon and that even if he could not participate in them all, he could follow using the lab materials shared with them by the OCI Lab Team.\nHis concern is that the labs are focusing on profitability while it is not his project's primary axis. zmorda explained that the program is an incubator for social enterprises and profitability is as essential as social impact\nYasser asked as well about the margin of flexibility in the project's Idea, since, when benefiting from the program, he had ideas that can improve the project. \nZmorda made it clear that he is free to add improvements\nAfterward, zmorda had the time to explain that the incubation within OCI LAB is mainly to validate the problem and the solution and to accompany the project leader into conceiving her/his prototype. She explained as well the selection process and the means of support that OCI Lab is offering\nOCI Lab team recommended Yasser to post on the platform to share an overview of the project leader, the project and the projects progress so far and offered to assist him with that\n\n**The second OTO Lab was held with @salaheddine Ogontayo, the project leader of \"The Identity App\"**\nSalaheddine is an HR and IT Specialist and full time dedicated to the \"Identity App\" which is an application targeting the new relocating people in the major cities of Tunisia. \nAfter the quick introduction, the project leader presented the service provided by the project as \"It will be providing its users with analytics and reports after tracking their user experience.\"\nFor the team, the challenges are where to find convenient data in Tunisia, benchmarking, the main issues that the new residents are facing\nThe app has a lot of features and can take a lot of time to be achieved. It has two main stakeholders (the new relocating people in the major cities of Tunisia.and the micro, small, and medium enterprises as customers) that make it scalable (B2C) and profitable (B2B), which makes the app more sustainable.\n \nThe OCI Lab Team tried to orient the project leader towards highlighting and showcasing the social impact of the project (which is existing- helping the small businesses ). \nAfterward, Zmorda explained the selection process and the means of support that OCI Lab is offering. She recommended as well to write a post on the platform to share an overview of the project leader, the project, the projects progress so far, the challenges, and the concerns.\n \n**The third OTO Lab was with @ayari.taha  the Project Leader of \"AI Mental Health\".**\nTaha is an IT engineer and social entrepreneur based in Sousse. He has dedicated his full time to the implementation of his project \"AI Mental Health\".\nHe had interviews with medical professionals, sociologists, psychologists & therapists in his prototype test phase.\nThese interviews oriented him in the development of the project.\nZmorda recommended to Taha to share the communications on the platform so that he enables the community to have access to his outcomes, he can be supported by the community members and to gain visibility regarding his progress and to have his work documented.\nTaha is working on this project on his own actually; for that, zmorda suggested to collaborate with the data science academy team. For that, an offline lab will be scheduled for the next week.\nzmorda explained the selection process and the means of support that OCI Lab is offering. \nTaha will be posting on the platform about the project and his progress as well as the challenges he is facing, the human & material resources needed\nTaha asked as well about the Festival mentioned in the application of the OCI Lab Incubator program.

It's the best feeling I can describe when thinking about my first month as a fellow for the OpenVillage festival. I am working with the Woodbine Health Autonomy group and my co-fellow Nicole. We are based in Queens, NY. \n\nChaos, like anarchy, are usually viewed as negative terms in our society. They denote disorder and structurelessness. They are usually states of being from which we wish to escape or wish to flee from. But looking at the seeming chaos of storms or of human physiology, it is clear that often times it is the incubator for something even more profound. Be it Einstein\u2019s hair, the genius behind insanity, or the warmth provided by a fire, they all produce \u201ca something\u201d out of chaos. And so in the past month as we dove head first into the chaos of the Edgeryders platform and communication methods, I see something profound being produced. \n\n_Communication_ \nOur first experience with Edgeryders and OpenCare was more than a year ago when we were contacted by members from OpenCare. They had seen a video we produced and were touched by the message. We wrote a blog post and we're soon overwhelmed with the format of communication. As one who has weaned himself off of social media and strives to check email once a day, the up-to-the minute communication and breadth of people was overwhelming.  Since then, we have had some interaction with OpenCare and were asked to apply for the fellowship in June, of which we were awarded.  \n\nAs above, the communication methods have always been an obstacle for me.  I\u2019ve often wondered why that was the case.  On the one hand, I\u2019m of the generation that is most comfortable with social media and the internet.  I\u2019ve spent literal years of my life diving into social media platforms and online conversations.  For me though, and perhaps one of the founding aspects of Woodbine is a rejection of the internet mentality.  Not to critique its usefulness, but more of a comment on technology\u2019s role in our lives.  For many in the US with counter-cultural ideas of anti-capitalism and revolutionary tendencies, the internet offers a way to create a community.  Similar to Edgeryders, many leftist communities arise on the internet, lending to an ability to share ideas, experiences, and fellowship.  For myself, some of these communities were paramount and life-giving.  One of the lessons from Occupy though was the power of true human interaction.  The mass gatherings, the communal dinners, the encampments all provided a new concept for our internet generation; that it was the building of tangible community that could be the most powerful.  For those who started Woodbine and previous iterations, there was a goal to create a space in which we could remove ourselves from our internet avatars and commune with people in the flesh.  So a big goal of our project was to transition ourselves from thinking of meeting online to meeting in person, to create projects developed from long-term presence and being.  So in that process, I have personally been trying to move away from internet-based means of communication (although I often spend too much time on email!).  It has been a process to begin thinking of the constancy of internet communication and responding to blog comments as the formation of a community.  And I think that is what will make the festival such a success.  That with the continuation of these festivals where people can meet face-to-face, it will form the basis of a much more solid connection than just emails and messages.  Inevitably in our world today, there is always the struggle between the local and the international.  While all true work must come from the local, we are facing massively connected systems of oppression, so we must be ready to fight on that level as well.  \n\n_The role of words_\nAs a collective, one of our goals with taking on this fellowship was the ability to add to the growing Edgeryders community, benefit projects that we wish to deepen connections, and stay true to the message we are trying to formulate.  It that vein, I will be transparent in my thoughts throughout these reflections.  I do not mean anything as a critique, but as a way to open doors to conversations and bridges through misunderstanding.  \n\nWoodbine was started as a way to build the material means for revolutionary lives.  We don\u2019t say this sarcastically or pathetically.  Our goal is to build collective power and create a path for a revolutionary life.  It denotes a process, not some distant utopia to be gambled upon.  \n\nWording is important.  Often the term \u201crevolution\u201d has been used to excuse horrific atrocities and recently has been co-opted by neo-capitalists for their marketing campaigns.  Even terms now used like \u201cautonomy\u201d are signaled by entrepreneurs to co-opt revolutionary language, instead representing the newest \u201ctech\u201d idea or pure individualism.  So one of our struggles has been to elucidate and elaborate on what we understand these words to mean.  It is a process of creating a vision for a new world.  The words of the past have meaning, which is why neoliberalism is so intent on co-opting our collective histories.  \n\nWe were recently in a great conversation about the role of wording in our title.  The original title of the theme we are to curate was \u201cLiving and working well together\u201d.  We then changed it to \u201cLiving Communism, Spreading Anarchy\u201d, which was a reference to a book written by comrades in France who have been influential to us.  There were comments around the terms \u201ccommunism\u201d and \u201canarchy\u201d, essentially arguing that perhaps these words are too \u201ccoded\u201d or have too much negative connotation.  After some thought, we changed the title to \u201cRevolutionary Care: Building Health Autonomy\u201d.  We recognized that we are new to the online community and the larger European history of these words, which maybe have different connotations in the US.  But it also brought up questions around being specific about what we as the Edgeryders/OpenCare community are trying to do.  With regards to care, do we view the OpenCare project as a means to fix the problems of state produced care?  Or do we view care as a basic right that is oppositional to the current global model of capitalism and the exclusionary notion of citizenship? Are we trying to reform neo-liberalism with apps or are we trying to fundamentally remove ourselves from its grip so that we can build the power necessary to destroy it?  The crisis we face as a community dedicated to care are caused by an exploitative means of viewing the world, be it climate change, the migrant crisis, and the rise of proto-fascist policies in our countries.  How can we as a community avoid the \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d trap of convincing ourselves we are saving the world through a techno-utopia?  Are we capital-based entrepreneurs or do we wish to build a world in which humanity can flourish?  I bring these questions up as a response to a general tendency in progressives circles to not want to create opposition to power.  So we soften language or we try to be on the middle ground.  But recent events and elections have pointed us to the idea that people are ready for strong language and great visions.  Not all visions lead to totalitarianism.  In the Americas, the indigenous struggles have clearly given us a path from which to follow.  They are clear in their language that they reject the extractive mentality of this culture.  For them, to be for the land and the people is to be anti-capitalist, and the path for their revolution is the daily struggle to build a new world.  Can we as a community be as courageous as them to use the strong language that will make us a beacon to a world of nihilism and distraction?            \n\n_Community_\nOverall, the experience of building this international community has been humbling and inspiring.  From working with Noemi (thank you for being patient with my delays and mishaps!), Nadia, Marco and the rest of the team helping the fellows!  My co-fellows Gehan and Winnie have been such a wealth of information and thought around the festival, happy to be working with them.  And in NYC, Nicole and I are the public faces of a much larger group of folks who are helping behind the scenes with ideas, group suggestions, research, etc.  Much thanks to them all.  \n\n@amelia for her post about Invisible Illness was a great way to describe the covering up of anxiety and angst as a trauma itself.  Care as providing a way to create solidarity must be paramount!  \n\n@duey for their inspirational account of Social, circus, community.  As Emma Goldman says, \u201cA revolution without dancing isn\u2019t a revolution worth having.\u201d\n\n@georgie for the humbling account of creating health without walls, without the infrastructure we are trained in.  True health autonomy will always come from the community, from those who have nothing to lose.  The place you are at is the best place to begin.  \n\nSo many more posts we\u2019ve read and thought about.  Please keep up the amazing work and help us share your work, so please contact us.  Let us know what you think and we look forward to the continuing the revolutionary work of building a new world, a world based on care for each other.  \n\n-_Frank_\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nToday we enter eclipse season.  It\u2019s a notorious time of flux and upheaval, closures and openings.  On tonight\u2019s full moon I will go out with a friend I\u2019ve made this year through my work at Woodbine and gather mugwort to bind into smudge sticks.  As summer begins its end here, this medicinal plant, which grows abundantly out of the lots and cracks in the sidewalk in Bed-Stuy, is just coming into the height of its magical powers; mugwort, or _artemesia vulgaris_, has been used traditionally as a stimulator of vivid dreams and a third-eye-opener.\n \nI\u2019ve begun my involvement with Woodbine Health Autonomy, and now with OpenCare, in the midst of a life transition.  I\u2019ve spent the past year orienting away from something that has circumscribed my understanding of myself\u2014who I am, what I\u2019m doing, and where I\u2019m going\u2014for a while now, toward a future that is more unknown.  For the last five years I\u2019ve been pursuing a PhD in art history.  By the end of my fourth year, however, the promises of academia had begun to ring hollow for me.  On the face of it, everything in the academy seems to be running as usual.  Universities keep reiterating the same forms: liberal arts educations, PhDs, lectureships and professorships, grants and post-docs.  Yet, at the very same time as they reiterate their merit and prestige in rhetoric and brochures, with the other hand universities are systematically undermining these entities in the course of running increasingly brazenly like large corporations.  Young academics cling to notions of critical discourse and transformative pedagogy even as they are forced to churn out work ever more rapidly and are saddled with heavier teaching and administrative workloads.  We reflexively assume the eventuality of a bright and stable future even as the university cuts tenure-track jobs and many end up out of work or living near the poverty line without benefits as adjuncts for years.  We are talking about social and economic justice as we watch the university function as a debt machine and factory for reproducing the wealth that has access to it in the first place.  In other words, we\u2019re stuck playing out an atrophied and anachronistic story, attached to ideas that have already expired. \n \nI\u2019ve been thinking a lot lately about genre.  By genre I mean the stories we tell ourselves about our lives and the categories these stories fall into.  Genre is the way our individual narratives conform to certain tropes because what\u2019s possible is delimited by historical circumstances and situational constraints.  Genre is how these tropes gather inertia and reproduce themselves, because it\u2019s easier to maintain a sense of constancy by slotting your life into a recognizable picture than it is to exist with shattering indeterminacy. \n \nIn his book on the historical novel, the Hungarian Marxist theorist Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e0cs talks about moments of what he calls a \u201cparting-of-the-ways.\u201d  Despite the heavily determining effects of class conflict and modes of production in the lives of individuals and societies, there are moments of pivotal decision that emerge when the inherent contradictions produce a \u201ccertain crucial sharpening of social or personal circumstances.\u201d  Luk\u00e0cs brings a quote from the German drama Herodes and Mariamne: \u201cTo every man there comes a moment when the pilot of his star hands him the reins.  The misfortune is he does not know the moment, each which passes by may be the one.\u201d \n \nThings have stopped working on a mass scale and no elected official\u2014no liberal, conservative, not even a socialist\u2014can salvage them.  At best they can mitigate the damage provisionally\u2014expand healthcare so more people can live to fight for dwindling jobs imperiled by automation, dole out a universal basic income to distract the ranks of the unemployed, support big corporate green energy projects that displace indigenous people from their land, reform prisons, relax immigration, even as carceral capitalism and state violence continues apace, etc.  There\u2019s no going back to the welfare state: \u201cThe transition from the citizen/worker model to the citizen/consumer/customer one means the transition from a welfare regime, based on the enforcement of social and fundamental rights, to social policies intended as the \u2018management\u2019 of social problems.  As subaltern \u2018customers\u2019 and/or \u2018needy,\u2019 we are deprived of full subjectivity and self-determination.\u201d\n \nEven as this past year saw new and frightening forms of rupture and instability worldwide, there\u2019s a way in which things also feel perversely stable.  The market ebbs and flows, wealth continues to concentrate in the streets and gleaming towers of New York, London, Shanghai, Dubai.  We keep waiting for our political offices to straighten themselves out, to straighten things out.  We keep going to work, looking for work, buying groceries, watching TV, picking our kids up from school.  We find ways of stabilizing, find stability in what Lauren Berlant calls the _crisis ordinary_.  She speaks about how genres can function as holding patterns, how we attach ourselves to stories that enable us to move forward\u2014or at least to tread water\u2014even as the these stories are actively harming us and inhibiting our flourishing.  And how could we not cling to narratives that afford us at least a provisional sense of constancy when we have no better option, when we need to pay the rent and put food on the table, when no matter how bad things get they never seem to tip into full-blown collapse?\n \nIt is impossible to give up our attachments to outdated, conservative, and harmful stories alone.  If, as Bourdieu says via @Gehan\u2019s wonderful citation, \u201c_our denial, the source of social alchemy is, like magic, a collective undertaking,_\" so too is overcoming this denial.  It isn\u2019t a matter of simply disabusing ourselves of ideology, of becoming woke, but of building the infrastructures that will enable us to radically reconfigure our narratives of where our individual lives are headed, of what life might mean over the next ten, thirty, one hundred years, without feeling like we are jumping into the void alone.  This is one definition of what revolutionary care means to me.\n \nI don\u2019t actually have a very good future imaginary.  While some possess much more prescient minds, for better or for worse I\u2019m mostly stuck analyzing what exists in the here and now.  As a historical materialist, I\u2019m especially aware that the limits to our political imaginations aren\u2019t creative, but structural.  The very categories we have to work with\u2014the ways we conceive of time, the past, our bodies and minds and the bodies and minds of others, our assumptions about what has value, what is progress\u2014have been formed in and by the political economic system we are trying to varying degrees to contend with.  We see this play out all the time; development schemes and NGO\u2019s propagating neo-imperialist dynamics, activists caught in a capitalist work ethic, so-called radicals reproducing racialized and gendered dynamics of power and violence. \n \nI think moving toward a truly better future together will entail deep and sometimes brutal examinations of our attachments.  It will mean giving up some of our most closely held notions about ourselves, conceding that things will change in ways we cannot predict, letting others in to a degree that is necessarily uncomfortable.  It will mean agreeing on provisional grounds of commonality knowing that our ideas will morph and evolve, that things will be revalued, that categories we can\u2019t yet imagine will emerge and be swallowed again in the course of things.  It means conceding that we don\u2019t have The Answer\u2014it isn\u2019t an app or a crypto-currency or a rural commune or an urban farm, though revolutionary change may involve all of these things.\n \nI know these are incredibly broad, abstract thoughts.  I\u2019m afraid I have many more like them.  But in the coming weeks and months I hope to think with greater specificity about what they mean in relation to my participation with OpenCare, to the goals of Woodbine Health, to our engagement with the many amazing groups and individuals cohered by this unwieldy and exciting platform, and for the conversations I hope we will have together in October.\n \nAs a wayward conclusion to a wayward post, I\u2019ll just say that I like weeds because they\u2019re the abject, valueless.  They\u2019re a reminder to me that the good stares us in the face all the time but we don\u2019t or can\u2019t experience it as such because we\u2019re busy or in pain or because it might not look like a product and maybe we don\u2019t have words or a framing story for it yet. \n\n-_Nicole_", "created_at": "2017-08-07 21:07:33.155531", "updated_at": "2018-11-22 21:30:22.454630", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 3052, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 488.2, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3613, 3362, 3756, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 86494, "user_id": 6905, "topic_id": 14228, "post_number": 26, "raw": "Hi All, I was thrilled to discover this group --- and I assigned @alberto's discussion of the economics of Walkaway to my students this week.

In many ways this year has become that of the \u2018unplannable\u2019.\n\nWith countries experiencing a second wave of coronavirus cases, no one can really say what the next five months may hold. Just like 2008 and the years thereafter, everything that lies ahead is uncertain.\n\nAt Edgeryders we have always believed there is strength in the collective and the journeys our members take together can help pave a way out of this unwieldy time.\n\nOn 21st July, we are holding [an event](https://edgeryders.eu/t/how-to-support-recovery-of-the-coworking-sector-an-online-summit-bringing-together-key-industry-figures-and-wider-sector-participants/13987) to discuss how the coworking sector can recover from the economic fallout of the pandemic. We have invited seven experts from all over the world who will be discussing their experiences and exploring the solutions on how they can begin to form a new route.\n\nFor inspiration ahead of the event, our co-founder [Nadia has shared her own path](https://edgeryders.eu/t/my-own-path-to-working-with-others-on-the-internet-and-what-i-hope-to-explore-with-others-during-this-event/14041) and how she came to found an organisation that has created digital tools for distributed co-creation and virtual coworking rooms.\n\nUniversities have also been hit hard by the crisis. In many ways they were an already broken system prior to the pandemic, with researchers and academics faced with unpredictability, a lack of job security, and a system with inbuilt inequality and biases.\n\nWe have previously talked about precarity in this sector at Edgeryders, but a new conversation has ignited around it specifically in relation to [German universities](https://edgeryders.eu/t/who-and-what-is-the-university-of-the-21st-century-for-breaking-through-neoliberal-agendas/13986/7), as our members imagine new ways in which universities can be funded and operate.\n\nOur community has also been discussing a route that many countries have taken in recent months to try and stop the spread of the virus - tracing apps. Our members are mostly in agreement that this road is misguided and such apps infringe on people\u2019s liberties and basic human rights.\n\nThe conversation [resumed](https://edgeryders.eu/t/a-surveillance-pandemic-results-of-the-community-listening-post-on-risks-for-freedom-in-the-wake-of-covid-19/13183/46) this week when one of our members raised questions over recent research that has found that in the Asia-Pacific region states that are inclined towards authoritarianism increased surveillance throughout the pandemic.\n\nOne of our members has previously posted about the contract-tracing app that is being used in Germany and asks, why people have not been more critical of it. If you have thoughts on an alternative path to take, [join the conversation](https://edgeryders.eu/t/germany-introduces-corona-virus-tracing-app-why-arent-people-more-sceptical/13906/10).\n\nSpeaking about creating different routes, our members have also been discussing the details of how a new internet could be developed - [one that\u2019s open source and free of big tech interest](https://edgeryders.eu/t/how-do-we-organize-society-for-a-whole-systems-approach-for-developing-the-internet/9766).\n\n---\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/121038912\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/121038912\">MARK PO\u017dLEP / PROMISED LANDS</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/abrahamsberg\">Aljo&scaron;a Abrahamsberg</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n### Join Edgeryders\nSign up [here](https://edgeryders.eu/c/campfire) to: \n* \ud83d\udcac Find the right conversations \n* \ud83d\uddd3\ufe0f Get invitations to our events\n* :open_book: Learn & build new knowledge \n* \ud83d\udee0 Co-create new projects and programs\n\n\n\n</Text>\n</Content>\n\n---\n\n<Content id=\"Support our work\">\n<Text>\n\n##  You can help.\n\n**Get in touch.** Edgeryders can support the work of changemakers in more than 80 countries because people like yourself support us with knowledge, contacts and resources.\n\nContact us on [Email](mailto:nadia@edgeryders.eu)  /  [Telegram](https://t.me/joinchat/JawU61gzONdIftzzvAyvUg) \n\n \n\n\n</Text>\n\n</Content>\n\n---\n\n</Webkit>", "created_at": "2020-07-10 14:36:43.695803", "updated_at": "2020-12-15 19:51:41.165109", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 772, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 12.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 59836, "user_id": 5392, "topic_id": 10857, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Moja historie mozna strescic wyrazeniem &quot;w pojedynke&quot;. Juz od malenkosci lubilam byc sama, spedzac czas sama, nigdy nie czujac sie przy tym samotna. Powrot ze szkoly i nikogo w domu - najlepsza nagroda po ciezkim dniu w szkole. Wyjazd na wakacje do egoztycznego kraju samemu - najlepsza przygoda. Zwiazek? Niekoniecznie. Dlaczego? Bo w zwiazku nie wypada robic za wiele samemu. Nie moglo byc wiec inaczej i dopadl mnie kolejny projekt &quot;w pojedynke&quot;, najwazniejszy projekt w moim zyciu - samotne macierzystwo. I mimo calego mojego uwielbienia do radzenia sobie samemu, niezaleznosci itd przyznaje ze nie jest latwo ale mimo wszystko sa plusy.\n\nZacznijmy od tego ze termin &quot;samotna matka&quot; ma jakies dziwne konotacje. Mi i wielu moim znajomym kojarzy sie od razu z jakas zabiedzona dziewczyna, bez perspektyw, ledwo wiazaca koniec z koncem, dla ktorej dziecko stanowi przeszkode dla rozwoju osobistego i generalnie przekresla szanse na lepsza przyszlosc. Mysle ze w wielu przypadkach troche tak to wyglada, ale nie zapominajmy ze w rownie wielu wyglada to zgola inaczej.\n\nGdy zaszlam w ciaze (totalnie nieplanowana) wiedzialam od razu ze czeka mnie samotne macierzynstwo. Wiele osob reagowalo na ten fakt kladac mi reke na ramieniu i pocieszajac slowami &quot;jakos to bedzie&quot;. Denerwowalo mnie to, gdyz od razu wskazywali, ze moja sytuacja jest beznadziejna, a ja jestem osoba zaslugujaca co najwyzej na litosc. Odbieralo mi to cala radosc oczekiwania na malenstwo. Jakby dziecko bylo jakims nieszczesciem ktore mi sie przytrafilo. Jakby bylo zyciowa porazka. Bylo ciezko. Kobieta w ciazy, nawet gdy ciaza przebiega prawidlowo, zawsze znajdzie powody do niepokoju. Ja juz 2 dni po usg, na ktorym uslyszalam ze wszystko super, zastanawialam sie czy przez te dwa dni nie zadzialo sie z tym malenstwem w brzuchu cos niedobrego. W tej sytuacji slowa \u201ejakos to bedzie\u201d sprawialy ze martwilam sie jeszcze bardziej \u2013 nie tylko malenstwem w brzuchu ale tez tym jak to \u201ejakos\u201d bedzie wygladalo. Ale przeciez nie bylo czym \u2013 jestem osoba wyksztalcona, niezle zarabiajaca. Mam mieszkanie. Jestem zdrowa i zaradna \u2013 nie ma powodow dla ktorych mialoby byc zle. W Polsce jednak wciaz panuje stereotyp samotnej matki. W czasie ciazy staralam sie o tym nie myslec. Staralam sie myslec pozytywnie. Po narodzinach dziecka wlaczyla mi sie jednak pewna zwiazana z tym obawa. Wyobrazilam sobie jak koledzy mojego syna opowiadaja o tym co ciekawego robili w weekend i ze wiekszosc z nich spedzila fajnie czas z tata \u2013 na gokartach, w kinie, na boisku \u2013 a moj syn nie bedzie mogl podzielic sie takimi opowiesciami. Nawet jak pojde z nim na to boisko to chyba glupio mu sie bedzie przyznac ze z matka kopal pilke (z dziewczyna???!!). Potem pojawil sie lek tez o mnie \u2013 samotna matka, ojciec dziecka gdzies w swiecie \u2013 co sobie o mnie pomysla rodzice kolegow mojego syna i czy nie odbije sie to jakos na postrzeganiu jego osoby, czy pozwola swoim dzieciom bawic sie z nim.... Mam ten lek do dzis. Brzmi to troche irracjonalnie ale to silniejsze ode mnie. Mieszkam z malym w Warszawie i mimo ze rozwody, patchworki, zwiazki nieformalne itd staja sie nowa norma, we mnie wciaz siedzi lek przed odbiegnieciem od utartego schematu, ktore moze negatywnie odbic sie na moim dziecku.\n\nCzy taki lek w obecnych czasach, w kraju takim jak Polska, ma racje bytu?\n\nZ jednej strony ciesze sie i jestem dumna z tego, ze jestesmy spoleczenstwem raczej przywiazanym do tradycji. Ciesze sie, ze obecny rzad stawia na rodzine. Ciesze sie, ze wladza mimo ze konserwatywna, robi uklon w kierunku rodzin niepelnych, nie dyskryminujac ich w zaden sposob. Bardzo mi to pomaga w walce z moim lekiem. Ale co najbardziej mi pomoglo w tej walce jak dotad to wsparcie kosciola \u2013 instytucji od ktorej spodziewalam sie raczej \u201ewyklecia\u201d za moje \u201eniegodne czyny\u201d niz pomocy. A to wsparcie objawilo sie w drobnych na pierwszy rzut oka sprawach. Pierwsza rzecz \u2013 spowiedz. Bedac jeszcze w ciazy postanowilam pojsc do spowiedzi po chyba 20 latach przerwy w spowiadaniu sie. Spodziewalam sie ciezkiej przeprawy i bylam psychicznie przygotowana na to ze rozgrzeszenia nie dostane. Co sie okazalo, ksiadz wybadal moja sytuacje po czym np zadeklarowal gotowosc w znalezieniu mieszkania (gdybym nie miala gdzie mieszkac), czy wsparcie psychologiczne w razie trudniejszych momentow. Z humorem podszedl do mojej sytuacji, dal rozgrzeszenie i nakazal dobrze opiekowac sie malym bo dziecko jest najwazniejsze (a wszystko inne jakos sie ulozy). Moja wizyta w konfesjonale byla dla mnie wielkim pozytywnym zaskoczeniem. Podobnie bylo z chrztem malego. Myslalam ze skoro dziecko nie z malzenstwa to beda jakies problemy \u2013 nie bylo zadnych. Maly i ja zostalismy potraktowani jak normalna rodzina i wszystko odbylo sie tak jak w przypadku tradycyjnych rodzin.\n\nCo jeszcze mi pomoglo \u2013 inne matki, z ktorymi ucinam sobie krotkie pogawedki na placu zabaw przy okazji pilnowania dzieci. Rozmowy zazwyczaj dotycza wychowania i domyslnie moi rozmowcy uwazaja ze mam meza i razem wychowujemy synka. Ja zawsze prostuje mowiac ze wychowuje go sama. I bardzo czesto okazuje sie ze one mi zazdroszcza! I nie mowie tu o kobietach ktorych mezowie eufemistycznie mowiac \u201eodbiegaja od idealu\u201d. Mowie o matkach w normalnych rodzinach. Czego zazdroszcza? Ze nie mam meza ktory oczekuje obiadu z dwoch dan \u201ebo przeciez caly dzien siedzisz w domu\u201d, ze nie mam tesciowej, szwagierki i calego tabunu ekspertek od wszystkiego od strony meza, ze nie zastanwiam sie kiedy maz wroci, czy wroci i czy nie obudzi dzieci, ze nie ma kto mnie denerwowac mowiac ze \u201eno to ja ide pobiegac/na silownie\u201d w sytuacji kiedy oczekujesz ze on zajmie sie tym dzieckiem choc przez 10 min zebys mogla wziac normalny prysznic lub po prostu odsapnac.... To pomaga. Pomaga spojrzec na sytuacje z innej perspektywy, dostrzec plusy. Ciesze sie ze coraz czesciej te reakcje wygladaja wlasnie tak a nie sprowadzaja sie do litosciwego glaskania po ramieniu. Spoleczenstwo sie zmienia.

From the graph below it suggests that it might be possible to reduce the intensity while keeping track of the index, in a similar way that \u201cperfect is the enemy of good\u201c where you may not get to 100%; but a small change can get you to 50% quite easily with not a lot of drama.\n\n![55%20PM|689x410](upload://4ZLgqpkaEyvQs2DDeRgUXAVMA7t.png) \n\n*Linking to possible etf is an exercise best left to the reader\u2026*", "created_at": "2019-12-17 14:56:15.595440", "updated_at": "2019-12-17 14:56:15.595440", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 314, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 22.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2346], "is_private": false}, {"id": 63995, "user_id": 2536, "topic_id": 10634, "post_number": 37, "raw": "ok cool. yes let's do that.", "created_at": "2019-11-13 14:58:03.494958", "updated_at": "2019-11-13 14:58:03.494958", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 7, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 7.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [63970], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3973, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 3940, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Open Ethnographer will use <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/ecomma\">eComma</a> as its base, but does not need (or: want) to show all features of its user interface since the purpose is different.

We hope others take the ideas, build on them &amp; make them better.\n\nAt 3.8B, the number of Internet users comprises more than half the world\u2019s population. When markets reach mainstream, new growth is harder to find as evinced by declining new smartphone shipments in 2018. While E-Commerce continues to gain share vs. physical retail, growth rates are slowing. While Internet advertising growth is solid &amp; innovation is healthy, there are areas where customer acquisition costs may be rising to unsustainable levels.\n\nWhile Internet user growth is slowing, global innovation &amp; competition continue to drive product improvements, new types of usage &amp; monetization \u2013 especially in areas of digital video, voice, wearables, on-demand + local services &amp; traditionally underserved markets. Outside of USA, we focus on especially high growth &amp; innovation in data-driven / direct fulfillment &amp; financial services. We highlight massive global usage changes related to the evolution of images &amp; interactive gaming as communications tools &amp; the broad emergence of freemium businesses at scale.\n\nThe rapid rise of gathered / analyzed digital data is often core to the holistic success of the fastest growing &amp; most successful companies of our time around the world. Context-rich data can help businesses provide consumers with increasingly personalized products &amp; services that can often be obtained at lower prices &amp; delivered more efficiently. This, in turn, can drive higher customer satisfaction. Better data-driven tools can improve the ability for consumers to communicate directly &amp; indirectly with businesses &amp; regulators.\n\nCore constituents (consumers / businesses / regulators) are increasingly drinking from a data firehose &amp; management challenges continue to rise for all parties. Broad awareness of challenges (&amp; related vigorous / heated debates) can be the first step in driving change.\n\nConsumers are aware of concerns about Internet usage overload &amp; are taking steps to reduce usage \u2013 leading USA-based Internet platforms have rolled out tools to help monitor usage &amp; social media usage growth appears to be decelerating following a period of strong growth. Privacy &amp; problematic content concerns are also top-of-mind &amp; are following similar patterns.\n\nOwing to social media amplification, reveals / actions / reactions about events can occur quickly \u2013 resulting in both good &amp; bad outcomes. In markets where online real-time rating systems exist, accountability can be improved vs. offline options as consumers &amp; businesses interact directly while regulators can also benefit.\n\nRapidly expanding connectivity has helped amplify voices of good &amp; bad actors. This has brought new focus to an age-old challenge for regulators around the world \u2013 finding the most effective ways to amplify good &amp; minimize bad, often resulting in different regional interpretations &amp; strategies.\n\nAs Internet systems become increasingly sophisticated, data-rich &amp; mission critical, so has the opportunity for cyber attacks. We are in a new era of cyber security where technology issues are increasingly intermixed with international diplomacy &amp; defense.\n\nWe focus on the impact of the Internet on work (via on-demand services &amp; remote options), education & healthcare \u2013 the materiality of current trends imply inflections are occurring. We update USA trending around government finances & the importance of immigration to the technology sector.\n\nThe Hillhouse Capital team provides insights into China \u2013 the largest market of Internet users & a leader in innovation / scale.\"", "created_at": "2019-06-24 16:35:01.671492", "updated_at": "2019-06-24 16:35:11.940173", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 564, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 12.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33974, "user_id": 1003, "topic_id": 6639, "post_number": 1, "raw": "On july 27th we gathered again with the open rampette community to share the final results of the project. \n\nWe presented the final prototypes of the solutions designed around the 2 topics we have been working on, namely \u201cthe call\u201d and  \u201cthe procedure\u201d, moreover while working on the two topics, we realized that there was a third topic emerging \u201cthe communication\u201d.\n\n**The Call**\nRegarding the call we shared with the community the feedbacks we got from the usability testing of the prototype (you can read more about it here).  And we let people experience the \nimproved/final version of it. \n\n**The Procedure**\nThe day before the event we had the chance to test the prototype in some real shop around isola neighborhood (read more about the test results here). The collective event was the perfect moment to share what we learned from it.\n\n**The communication**\nAlthough the theme partially overlaps the two themes already discussed we decided it had so much importance it required to be treated alone. \n\nThe topic addresses some questions we already asked ourselves during the research:\nHow do I recognize if a shop is accessible?\nHow do I know where to find an accessible shop in town?\nHow can Minerva explicit the fact that they are well equipped to welcome dioniso?\n\nWe believe that communicating the right message in terms of accessibility  is as important as filing all the paperwork required to be \u201clegal\u201d.\nIn fact, as discussed also during the user test with the doorbell, the very simple sticker we designed gives Dioniso the confidence that he will feel ok pressing that doorbell. \n\n---\n\nAfter presenting the development about the three topics here, we finished our presentation mentioning a couple of global take aways we wanted to share with the community.\n\n**Inside out: from the details to the global scale**\nMakers usually have this kind of approach; you start making something and than you reflect on the impact that the thing you are making might have and how you can improve your design.\nThinking practically in terms of solutions in the beginning of the design process gives you a solid starting point you can use to test your assumption and discuss your ideas from the very beginning.\nAt the same time you are continuously pushed at thinking about how your solution might fit in the context and how it can link to the other pieces of the system.\n\n**Tangible solutions**\nLetting people touch with their hands some prototypes and experience a potential improvement regarding their issues is not just the best way to collect feedbacks; but it is also a super effective way to demonstrate policy makers that things can be changed and improved. \n\n**Multiple voices/experiences and new communication channels**\nAlong the project we created an environment open to critiques and ideas coming from different perspective. The active participation momentum gave us the opportunity to engage offices and functions of the municipality not directly linked to the project (i.e. ufficio suolo pubblico and urbanistica)\n\n**Testing and iterations for an agile policymaking**\nSmall iterations, user research, interviews are few elements that guided our design process. While those concepts and tools are well accepted in the world of the industry (in the startup world  as well as in the most robust companies), in the domain of policymaking, regulations, and administration of city they haven't been quite discovered yet.\nWe believe that some of the techniques we adopted can be translated in the exciting domain of the city regulatory system. Agile can be applied to policymaking and at WeMake we would be more than happy to open a table with the municipality to understand how.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1f6QVy8j10QgRWNNPNUHhIDbbXiB7IR6KoP0n8-OVnaE/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000", "created_at": "2017-08-04 13:34:58.712721", "updated_at": "2017-10-05 17:46:51.227582", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 624, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 1.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33435, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 1519, "post_number": 65, "raw": "<b>Yes, rigidity</b>\n\nRigidity is the word for the current crisis politics by Germany.

Also mix of education and entertainment (ideally mnemonic songs) so that various demographics can be catered to.\n2) Close. Yeah, mp3 players are affordable even by the standards of the global poor (less than 1 USD / day). Also: mp3 players are a less \"fungible\" bartering commodity, and prone to misuse. \n3) Absolutely! We're actually making an effort to start up the beginning structures for the audience to start making, adapting, and improving their own material. Also, once you can do this - most of it is a very transferable skill set. \n4) Yup, this is something I haven't gone into detail about yet, but you're right. Where OLPC is \"one laptop per child\", this is more intended to be \"one mp3 player per 3 kids\" (one per earphone, who explain the lecture to a third - who then gets tested). We'll surely experiment with loudspeaker / group scenarios but the feedback is less granular in most cases, and I'd like to explore what the intimacy of the relationship can do for us e.g. in sensitive issues such as STDs (sexually transmitted diseases - where you don't tend to want to ask a lot of detail questions, and ask for a re-run of the lecture...)\n5) Yeah - this will be a highly interesting question: How to epitomize delivery, and then \"attrition / survival\" of the devices, and perhaps how to optimize \"self organization\" (e.g. via spoken guidance) - perhaps optimized for maximizing content impact, player survival rates, repair proficiency increase, player diffusion, content diffusion, etc.\nSuper interesting in my opinion!

I need it for my kitchen stove and usually buy 30 l at 1.46 EUR/l [here](http://www.shop.energieprofis.net/epages/61828859.sf/de_DE/?ObjectPath=/Shops/61828859/Products/EKH100240P303). The hydrogen peroxide in the WHO formulation is just against bacterial spores, but since you want it against the COVID-19 virus you'd not need that. Adding the glycerol is against the drying effect of ethanol, which is more comfortable, but in an emergency you'd also not need that. No gelling agents are needed, just rub your hands with a bit of the stuff until dry.\n\n**Edit:** Just seeing that my favourite online shop [also has the isopropyl alcohol](https://shop.energieprofis.net/epages/61828859.sf/de_DE/?ObjectPath=/Shops/61828859/Products/IKH999080P301) as used in the WHO Formulation 2 from the above link. Using that has the advantage that (as far as I can see) isopropyl alcohol is not denaturated, while ethanol is. Denaturation of ethanol means adding a bitter substance that makes it undrinkable, preventing its use in moonshine production. That bitter substance is not dangerous in a hand sanitizer, but may transfer a bitter taste when touching food (I doubt it would be noticeable, but the WHO document speaks about that).", "created_at": "2020-03-04 14:32:31.909654", "updated_at": "2020-03-04 14:46:03.543573", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 278, "wiki": false, "reads": 20, "score": 94.0, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [70898], "is_reply_to": [70898], "is_liked_by": [4022, 6150, 8, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22649, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4840, "post_number": 13, "raw": "<b>\"Paste as unformatted text\"</b>\n\nHello <a href=\"/u/mishek\">@mishek</a>, we have a known issue with the way the WYSIWYG editor treats font size.

I\u2019m really sad that I missed the Open Village Festival but got lost in life for a while and still having to struggle to keep my head above water. But I come here with some new insights and concepts that I would like to share with you all. I call it Rezonansboden, because it\u2019s a beautiful German word that can be literally translated to resonance board. This thinking exercise is meant to open a dialogue and at the same time assort my own ideas. \n\n**Slow communication** \nI\u2019ve always been fascinated by the romanticized idea of corresponding with philosophers from everywhere in the world through long and elaborated letters like Passolini and Calvino, Nietzsche and Wagner or Steinbeck. It\u2019s often witty, sometimes moving and always honest. It\u2019s a form of communication that has been lost through time mostly in favour of fast communication like facebook messenger or whatsapp. Don\u2019t worry I will not start a tirade about how it was better in the old times and now Facebook corrupted the youth and nobody is thinking anymore. I\u2019m 28 year old, am a decade on Facebook and before that almost 5 years on MSN and Myspace. I\u2019m a product of this time. \n\nBut what made me thinking were the recent outlets of the inventor of the like button about the unstable society Facebook is creating throughout its medium (Figaro, [Usbek&Rita](https://usbeketrica.com/article/ancien-cadre-facebook-merde-detruit-societes)).  I don\u2019t want to quite facebook immediately (I have no idea where to start), but I want to make it obsolete to use so I\u2019m trying to fight the urge of communicating 24/7 through it by finding new (or old) communication methods. I already try to bring my most prolific messenger buddies to use telegram and try to have all work related discussions outside of the facebook bubble. \n\nBut now came the idea to bring the [slow food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_Food) principles to our way of communicating. Last week I started this by writing a long letter to a friend of my living in Zurich. We talk a lot through messenger but have that tendency to talk sporadically because of both our hectic lives. I turned the tables  and proposed to her to start writing long letters and take the time for it: \n\n\u2018\u2019This exchange is meant to get its own flow, take your time, don\u2019t rush into things like we all do at the moment in life. It\u2019s meant do get more grounded with ourselves and the people that surround us. Use it as your \u2018rezonansboden\u2019.\u2019\u2019\nToday I did the same but with a stranger. For a long time now I dream to write a book about the reason why the Iranian movies are so powerful in a cinematographic way. So what I did is just sending out a mail to a visual artist to open the discussion through correspondence and who knows in maybe ten or fifteen years I could write something interesting about it. These exchanges will be much more rewarding I think then the likes I get when I publish something, because they will be crafted by time and not be volatile. \n\n**Before you go to travel write a letter**\n\n That brings me to another dilemma I was fighting with in the last couple of months: my constantly itching urge to travel but my incapacity to slow travel at the moment. Slow travel means for me having a low as possible impact as a tourist on your destination and traveling the most green as possible. But in a world where flight tickets to Barcelona are cheaper than train ticket to the Belgian coast it is quite difficult to not fall for those opportunities.\n\nYes, we all are cosmopolite people that are conscious enough to not fall into tourist traps. I even gave myself the rule to give every travel a purpose: meet interesting entrepreneurs, discover new products for the shop, take part as a volunteer at a festival or exchange ideas with local writers. But there was still no real reason other than, hmm this look like a cool city, in the first place. \n\nSo when writing my first couple of correspondences I found myself in an interesting thought bubble. When creating long lasting trust relationships with people from around the globe a travel can become so much more meaningful at the moment you \u2018consume\u2019 it. This seems for me the only ethical possibility to still travel by plane if in all mean necessary. Doing it by train or other public transport and taking your time is of course still the best option.  \n\n**Why I don\u2019t understand apologies anymore**\n\nFinally a little side note around apologies. In the last couple of years I rewired some of my thinking reflexes to be more in line with the common principles. I try to bring every time something to the table without expecting anything else in return and if I don\u2019t feel useful anymore or can\u2019t be useful I take a step aside from the decision board. \n\nNow lately I found myself in a conflict situation where apologies where asked and didn\u2019t found it to be fair that apologies should be unilateral. First thing that popped in my head was: \u201cHe that is without sin among you, let him cast the first stone at her.\u201d But this is in fact a wrong premise, blocking anybody to take a step forward. I didn\u2019t want to use this to justify my wrongdoing; I just wanted a way where you learn more then only admitting the fact that you were wrong. You don\u2019t build anything further but a fragile equilibrium between power struggles. Why don\u2019t we change that in: \"let's acknowledge our own sin to learn together for a brighter future\"?\n\nWith this I mean that any wrongdoing can only be remedied in a setting of forgiveness (thank you [Hannah Arendt](https://cenlib.tau.ac.il/sites/cenlib.tau.ac.il/files/media_server/Wiener/forgiveness_arendt.pdf) and [The Truth And Reconciliation commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_and_reconciliation_commission)) This would make it possible to grow having a creation of dialogue instead of a one way apology that only creates a power struggle. We all sin so why don't we make it a collective learning experience?\nVoila these where my ruff ideas of the moment that I would love to share with you. I choose Edgeryders as the community to share it on because I find the exchanges on these pages always enriching. The final thing I would love is have the energy back to do my morning coffee routine. Anybody up for it in Brussels? One (or two coffees) ,between 8h30 and 10h, in the city center, a good topic and a nice exchange conversation.\n\nKind regard,\nYannick", "created_at": "2017-12-13 14:47:41.296123", "updated_at": "2017-12-13 19:13:48.714248", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1162, "wiki": false, "reads": 30, "score": 466.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 3904], "is_private": false}, {"id": 36956, "user_id": 4044, "topic_id": 7180, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Thanks for your introduction and kind words @noemi!

I have simply finished my gig with them and am looking to take what I've learned forward :D \n\nThe workshop with Nadia was awesome! I learned that my project isn't as convoluted as it can be in my head if I can articulate it clearly and that people from outside my areas of interest can understand and appreciate it. I learned that letting someone have a meta conversation about the conversational style we're having is helpful to create more productive conversation (if someone says they can talk forever if we let them, then it's easier to remind them of what they said rather than telling them \"you're talking too much\"which can be insulting. I learned about the cards which help one focus on a variety of business areas @nadia showed us. I learned about letting the \"users\" gather their own \"data\" in a way that's more easy to collect in real time rather than sending surveys. And that mixing Zaatar and oil before serving it makes a cement that's almost impossible to extract, so keep them separate. \n\nIn terms of family... my parents have been having a tough time due to a brother who is a \"failure\" in their eyes. No job, keeps getting into trouble with the law / courts, accidents, broken bones, and they're very concerned. I left Michigan due to feeling very bottled up due to the conservative attitude they held, only to find that I miss them, and that the conservative attitude sometimes feels like a warm blanket for me in the cold open air of questioning, doubt, and a nomadic life. In terms of communities, I have many, and friends - who would open their homes to me. Yet somehow I do not feel close to many people. I'm not sure what the reason is yet and I'm thinking perhaps it's due to my lack of stronger family connections. There's this idea in the muslim tradition that before you go help others, help those closest of kin to you, then move out. I see them getting older and I feel that there is something I must do, we will see. \n\nYeah! I guess I agree with baderdean - that I'm not replacing other belongings, but to form a cohort, or a crew, a set of likeminded people who can support an evolving vision.

I did call the Plovdiv 2019 office and they told me they plan to have one more call next year - we will keep an eye on this. Plus, the idea is very flexible, as it revolves around the creation of new myths and rituals (for the presence and the future) - so whenever we find a suitable grant, we can repurpose it and make it happen elsewhere. \n\n- With @Noemi, we are preparing for the conference in Romania - I've been working on our slides and thinking of what exactly should we propose to the audience and possible clients. Noemi suggested an Art Camp with one-month residencies, while I'm tempted to describe it as a modular project which can last a varied amount of time and have different purposes, depending on the needs and ambitions of the city. What do you think makes more sense? I'm thinking of using these trials to explore ways of plugging into cities for longer periods and maybe testing the more international iterations of The Reef? \n\nHere you can see the slides (work in progress, any comments welcome until tomorrow) https://www.canva.com/design/DADGxmrFZx8/share?role=EDITOR&token=WURWTGFgIzq3RqZ8hPx35A&utm_content=DADGxmrFZx8&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton\n\n- I have visited the festival Mesto Zensk in Slovenia, where I had a chance to meet cultural workers and artists and made some interesting connections. I have met Maude and Bernie from a community theater in Dublin, located in the maternity hospital, which works with disenfranchised groups from the neighborhood and the city. We're definitely interested in collaborating in the future. I also met the visual/video artist Marva Arsanios, who did some impressive works about the feminist community movements in Rojava, unionization of Mexican house workers and the creation of new land in Lebanon (her homeland) by using waste and demolished houses to build new land in the sea. Plus, the curator of the festival, an organizer of a feminist film festival in Skopje, a couple of designers and local artists and some passionate beer brewers :) Even had a chance to ask a question to Francoise Verges at a small panel on decolonial feminism. \n\nPlus, I think I found a suitable call for our general ambitions in creating artistic spaces and connecting complex research subjects with creative work and participation. We have over a month to develop the proposal - take a look and let me know if that makes sense? https://eacea.ec.europa.eu/sites/eacea-site/files/2._guidelines_coop2019_eacea_34_2018_en_0.pdf\n\n@alex_levene @noemi", "created_at": "2018-10-22 15:12:36.026623", "updated_at": "2018-10-22 15:12:36.026623", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 484, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 117.8, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2201, 3067, 3, 2569], "is_private": false}, {"id": 75830, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 13023, "post_number": 31, "raw": "@Alessandro I am curious... have you relocated yet?

This social Hackathon is organized by UNDP Belarus and I am very happy to be part of the organization of this event. The aim of this social Hackathon is to create a platform for social innovators where they can create a prototype (does not have to be technical) focusing on three prior identified spheres: Health, Environment and employment of people with disabilities. For each sphere we selected 3 teams of social innovators that will work on their ideas/projects and eventually present their build prototype the next day during the final. The ideas vary from building a mobile application for a 15 minutes interactive course on HIV to the development of a robot for people with disabilities.\n\nEdgeryders, a global network for social innovators to find and support each other's work,\u00a0is also going to be active during the Hack4SocialChange. Not only by following the teams closely but also we continue with the building of the collaborative map on social innovators in Belarus. This is a great chance for Edgeryders to act since many social innovators will gather in one place.\n\nKeep you posted!

That's pretty old, but it still does the things I need it for and I like the smaller size.  Next year Apple will stop supporting it so I will have to upgrade.\n\nI use a 2013 MacBook Pro 15 inch.  It has 16G RAM, 256G SSD and the ports I like: USB, HDMI and a card reader plus audio output.  Works great still, best laptop I've had, and I have had a lot of laptops.  But most of my software won't run on a 64 bit operating system, so I have a reckoning coming up with this rig too.  Too bad because it is such a great machine, even if the battery has that stupid glued-in to the keyboard design.\n\nI do not have an Alexa or other smart listening device.  The spyware aspect just puts me off. Plus I hardly ever ask people for help so don't really have a need to tell a device to do things for me.  \n\nAnd I don't have a smart doorbell or any cameras, or smart appliances. my step-daughter, who also works in high-tech, loves those devices that auto-set the room temp from your phone, adjusts the curtains and window blinds and all that other servant-style stuff.\n\nI have a car. A couple of them actually. I live in California and we have to travel distances that don't have good public transportation.  We're way behind Europe on such things and always have been I think.  My wife drives a hybrid, but I have a 2000 Toyota that was low miles and cheap.  When it wears out I will re-think my vehicle situation.\n\nOn airplanes I use noise-canceling headphones.\n\nI like good audio and I love the cinema. My house has a cable-modem Internet connection, but not a TV subscription.  I only do streaming or watch DVDs, which I sometimes buy at thrift stores.  I play it all through a stereo system I have had for years that is mostly stuff I got on eBay and thrift stores.  Great audio is easy to get for not much money if you know what to look for, don't mind if units are bulkier and use wires.  I still use CDs sometimes but have been phasing them out in favor of burned files on a hard drive. When I play them back I send them through a special DAC that bypasses the cheap soundcard on a laptop. When I ran a radio station I liked to hear things at the higher end of quality. So what I have sounds great.\n\nI do some work in the cloud such as Google Docs for work, though would rather not have to, since I don't trust Google. And I back up my own files on hard drives, with redundancy.  MIl spec hard drives.\n\nI admit that I use Facebook. Too many friends that I would not otherwise keep up with.

Les citoyens n'\u00e9taient pas les bienvenus derri\u00e8re ces portes. Nul ne sait ce qui se passait derri\u00e8re ces portes closes. La lecture quotidienne des journaux laissait entrevoir une d'une \u00e9paisse propagande envers le dirigeant du pays, qui vantait ses m\u00e9rites avec une telle pompe que l'on pouvait apercevoir la masquerade en l'espace de quelques secondes. Les citoyens refusaient de parler de politique dans leurs maisons, en priv\u00e9, de peur de se faire enlever, parce que le moindre mot de travers les exposaient \u00e0 de myst\u00e9rieuses disparitions. Des dizaines d'individus diff\u00e9rents m'ont racont\u00e9 des histoires de disparition li\u00e9es aux dirigeants du pays.

Il n'y a pas de gouvernement ouvert dans ma province, m\u00eame si moi-m\u00eame et de nombreux autres citoyens, cela fait longtemps que nous en r\u00e9clamons un. Le gouvernement a \u00e9tudi\u00e9 la question pendant 16 mois et a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un rapport \u00e0 ce sujet. Mais il n'y a toujours pas de politique de gouvernement ouvert. Il n'y a rien. Il n'y a pas de donn\u00e9es ouvertes. Il n'y a rien.

I am a service designer and digital transformation consultant based in Italy. I speak English and Italian.\n\nI think the NGI project is quite interesting and have followed developments especially the LEDGER project popularized by Rob Van Kranenburg. My interests are in the area of IoT &amp; Embedded Device Design, Fourth Industrial Revolution, 5G, Autonomous Vehicles, user experience for emerging technologies.\n\nWhy? I think that technology is a combination of human, physical and societal constructs. The multidisciplinary nature is what excites me about the hybrid design-technology space that I thrive in and so fits into the Edgeryders project on understanding the motivation and needs of citizens to drive policy for the Next Generation Internet.\n\nIn the past, I have consulted for ITU (Geneva) working on designing the web of things curriculum with focus on design and programming. Also with Packt (India)/Udemy on research/content for Autonomous Vehicle Technology focusing on Perception for AVs. Safi Analytics (USA/Kenya) on smart factory policies. Visiting lecturer at Barcelona Technology School, Masters in Digital Transformation.\n\nI have been a part learning communities and professional forums most notably the EU internet of things Council by Rob Van Kranenburg and IDF. I have curated the blog for service design network in the UK, as well as community manager for UXers Forum on LinkedIn. I write regularly with a column on [www.internetofallthings.com](https://www.theinternetofallthings.com/iot-product-design-12082018/amp/). I speak and facilitate workshops around Europe. For Instance the IoT Day events, EU Code week. I have also in the past managed distributed teams across geographies using online platforms and productivity tools such as Skype, Slack and Dropbox. With also managing Whatsapp group conversations for my team.\n\nIn its simplest form, I understand that conversations and participation is necessary to move ideas forward and giving people the agency to participate is paramount. I understand that inclusion in the NGI is about enabling an internet where everyone can participate and thrive and trust and feel secured.\n\nRecently, I facilitated a workshop for students from the Catalan region as part of the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Over 2 days, we designed the future of communication. It is not the amazing solutions or talent of the students that stood out for me and many others but the conversation at every step which tends to skew the assumptions we had on privacy and trust. To quote,\u2019\u2019 Privacy is mine and what I make of it. I own the process and the policy\u2019\u2019.\n\nEnabling conversation is a skill that as a designer, I have come to terms with over the years. Probing, framing/reframing and asking questions without interference and this skill will be important in facilitating an online community.\n\nOn the sidelines, I have had event cameos with notable experts such as Rob Van Kranenburg, Antonio Grasso, Luigi Atzori and Nesta (UK &amp; Italy), all involved in the NGI project in various capacities. You can view my CV here: https://bit.ly/2FaUaHU.

For people starting from zero, it is the only way to avoid staying at zero (that is, staying an employee or even unemployed forever). Because only as a business, you can take part in the market where the money is, instead of being the last link in the corporate food chain only (as an employee).

It's been a joy to navigate these waters with you and this post is a gift to that process.\n\nSeeing as I've shared plenty in said process already, I'll drop some of my reflections to this post as they come.. \n\n[quote=\"alex_levene, post:1, topic:9193\"]\nWe see that the issues we face, and the opportunities we must take, are global in scale, but all our current problem solving mechanisms are levers that reside at the nation state level. This is a fundamental issue.\n[/quote]\n\nYes. I'm also reminded of how many of us are also seeing that the opportunities we must take are also at a **local scale**. For example, the Local Futures' documentary from several years ago called **[\"Economics of Happiness\"](https://www.localfutures.org/programs/the-economics-of-happiness/)** which maps the impacts of globalisation and shows how local economies can be a way for people to reclaim their agency, wellbeing and happiness (yes, happiness!) in feasible and collaborative ways. Part of my vision that aligns with some of our colleagues here at Edgeryders is that of the power of _networking local responses to mobilise large scale change_ - eg. [OpenVillage](https://edgeryders.eu/c/openvillage). And of course, there's the micro-democracy of @malka's book [**\"Infomacracy\"**](https://publishing.tor.com/infomocracy-malkaolder/9780765385154/) that is a radical and inspiring offering at this globalised edge you speak of. \n\n[quote=\"alex_levene, post:1, topic:9193\"]\nI have always believed that fiction inspires theory; and theory inspires practice. But when we scan the edges of our societies, we see a lot of the speculative practice already happening, so where is the theory and fiction?\n[/quote]\n\nThis brings to mind the field of **Speculative Fabulation** or more simply the practice of \"Fabulation.\" To me it's a kind of writing of a concept's worlds in their becoming. In other words, think of a concept. Now think of how that concept could be found or hypothetically exist in the world - how might it be practiced, function, build, impact, dance and so on... And now, how does that world write itself into being?  But from its own subjectivity and no one elses. Wait what? A world writing itself outside my own words and the bounds of what we know? Yes. That to me is speculative fabulation. \n\nOne of my favourite things is collaborative writing, and a step further, something I've begun calling _collaborative autotheory_. It's a kind of collective autobiographical writing that straddles theory and fabulation. Maggie Nelson's [The Argonauts](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22929741-the-argonauts) is a good example, minus the fabulation, and keeping in mind the collective is the many parts of her as author and subject. \n\nWhat would it look like if we gave people a theoretical concept related to Econ Sci Fi, and then the conditions and provocation to write the world into becoming? A technique I use sometimes via my colleagues Andrew Murphie and Brian Massumi is **conceptual speed dating**. It's where you have a concept and you speed date around it and it becomes its own entity through the many stories and hypotheses and conversational flows that intersect and expand the concept. And wait, you've created a way to connect theory and fiction too!

I forgot to mention two of them, \"Conscription, military patriarchy and the way it affects the society\" and \"Collective memory: stories of the peaceful co-living of Armenians and Azerbaijanis before the conflict\". Both are in research phase now, and I am uncertain when I will be able to actually work on these highly sensitive topics, taking into consideration the fact that the official peace process is stagnating and nationalist rhetoric is fuelling, rising tensions between the societies both in Armenia and Azerbaijan. Revanchist and military rhetoric has become widespread in recent years through the targeted introduction of enemy images into people's consciousness, and even the idea that it is genetically impossible for Armenians and Azerbaijanis to live side by side has been aired. \nMembers of the younger generation who have no experience of inter-ethnic interaction (since the societies became mono-ethnic as a result of the war in the early 90s) are particularly vulnerable to propaganda. Many of them see the other side as demonised, abstract, and not possessing the same human qualities as themselves. Thus it becomes easier to justify one's readiness to fight and hurt this \"other\". All that remains of warm relations between neighbors are the memories, and documenting and passing these on to the next generation is a pressing task.I also aim to investigate the way the ongoing conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan affects the people living on both sides of the border.\n\nGlad you have the privilege to be in a sabbatical, you definitely needed that, being the hardworking multitasking bee that you are <3\n\nIt is definitely going to be a challenge to fundraise for the festival, but there is the almighty Armenian Diaspora, that loves Artsakh so much, so I hope they will prove their love through actions now.

Russell Bernard, Editor\nAmber Wutich, Associate Editor\nFIELD METHODS\nfmx.sagepub.com\n_____________________\n \n\n## reviewer 2\n\nThis (revised) paper proposes a mixed methods approach to analyse ethnographic online data by combining traditional qualitative data analysis and network analysis techniques. While the revised paper does a good job in responding to many of the reviewers\u2019 comments and suggestions, I have some remaining concerns which would require a further revision.\n\n\n### Major points:\n\n1. One of the main elements of the proposed approach is that it treats conversations in online domains as human communities. However, the term \u2018human communities\u2019 is not defined or explained and is used inconsistently throughout the text. For example, on p. 3 the term \u2018virtual communities\u2019 is used instead. A clarification of the term and how members construct a community in interaction would be essential since the analysis of the codes is based on members\u2019 interactions. The literature on \u2018online communities\u2019 might be helpful in framing the discussion. => @alberto or rather @amelia?\n \n\n* While the coding process of the online data is much clearer in this version, the role of the researcher as participant-observer and coder (including biases inherent in this process) should be further discussed. To illustrate, on p. 7 you state \u201cWe visualize and treat ethnographic data in network form, simultaneously displaying the informants' social network (who informants are talking to) and the content of their conversations (what informants are talking to each other about).\u201d\nI would argue that the content of the conversations as captured in the codes is an interpretation of what has been discussed by the informants, and not content as such. => @amelia \n\n* Visualizing the codes produced by the researcher in a network form is the main contribution of this paper. Yet the potential of semantic networks does not come as strong as it should be. I would encourage the authors to go beyond the technical and statistical parts of semantic networks (section 2.2) and discuss in-depth the possibilities of semantic social networks to discover meaning on different levels of analysis (i.e. collective beliefs and individual interactions). => @amelia\n \n* The social interactions among participants and interactions among codes are important components of the proposed approach. As stated on p. 7 (\u201cOur chosen representation has only two types of nodes, participants in the conversation and ethnographic codes, and only three types of edges: comments (participant-to-participant), references (participant-to-code), and co-occurs-with (code-to-code).\u201d). The \u2018references\u2019 and \u2018co-occurs with\u2019 interactions seem unclear to me. How do you capture the \u2018participant-to-code\u2019 interaction? As to the \u2018co-occurs with\u2019 interaction, I understand that this comes through the annotations, but what do you mean by content in the following sentence in which you describe that specific interaction \u201cIts edges are induced between two codes that occur in annotations that refer to the same post or content\u201d (p. 13)? Is the content referring to the whole dataset? @alberto \n \n* The description of the social network (section 4.1) is not very clear to me. More specifically, you end this part with the following sentence \u201cThese structural features allow us to conditionally accept that most opinions expressed in the forum have been run past someone (other than the proponent) in the conversation.\u201d (p. 12).\nWhat is the point here? Who is this someone else? And since that most opinions expressed in the forum run by him/her, would not be important to look into it? => @alberto \n \n* As the semantic social network is the main element of the proposed method, it would also make sense to present a network graph based on your analysis under section 4.2. We only get to see a part of this network by filtering edges by k>=6, and I am wondering why you haven\u2019t included the whole network. => @melancon \n_________________________________ \n \n\n## reviewer 4\n \nOverall, the paper is more comprehensive now as it covers a broader range of content. In doing so, it also becomes clear that the paper does not make a novel contribution in terms of methods. As referenced by the authors, the idea of coding for social actors and encoding their communication exchange has been proposed and demonstrated before. Also, a new method would need more stringent evaluation. The paper might be better positioned as an applied research study, where a substantive question would need to be addressed, e.g., related to the focus of the online community that was studied. => @amelia (in the letter alone).", "created_at": "2019-02-19 22:04:19.461022", "updated_at": "2019-03-08 01:03:16.930762", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 886, "wiki": false, "reads": 31, "score": 96.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3310], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62818, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 11249, "post_number": 11, "raw": "[quote=\"matthias, post:10, topic:11249\"]\nBasically a limited liability company under the exclusive control of an association, and all tenants become members of the association automatically (which is low cost and low admin, in contrast to changing a manager of a company).\n[/quote]\n\n\nBut does that not mean that 51% of members can deny the other 49% the right to live in the house, even after paying for it?", "created_at": "2019-11-02 19:13:06.287951", "updated_at": "2019-11-02 19:13:06.287951", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 70, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 12.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [62817], "is_reply_to": [62817], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24716, "user_id": 3362, "topic_id": 6201, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Synergies</b>\n\nI agree capacity is the bottleneck. Looking for synergies with what is already going on, within ReaGent or otherwise, is a good strategy: Ekoli, schools, universities, dedicated organisations that have some form of an\u00a0educational track already (eg. Belgian diabetes liga &lt;Dutch&gt;\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.diabetes.be/wat-diabetes\">https://www.diabetes.be/wat-diabetes</a>).\n\nI advocate for\u00a0working progressively, starting with things that can be made quickly (knowledge tidbits, short posts, graphics, ...) while building up reach and resources for harder things.\n\nIdeally all educational material can be shared with Sydney and Oakland and made so that it requires minimal effort to adapt it to the local conditions. This goes for local use as well:\u00a0if we can make it so it is easily used by any type of\u00a0organisation for many types of audience, spread it openly, we save ourselves a lot of groundwork. It takes a\u00a0bit more coordination work, however it translates in more reach for everyone involved.\n\nYouth education would be an exception, as fitting it into the local educational system will always require some work. In the Belgian case, I think we have enough experience with Ekoli to do this. We can try to share this experience through an appendix though.\n\nWe should flesh out a good synergy with the goal of the Open Insulin project as @Noemi mentions. Ideally the three points made by Anthony can be integrated in Niek's idea.

We're already using a graph database for the Realities project, and since they don't have schemas, but rather nodes and edges, it's quite possible start with a database which only serves Realities and then later adding new node and edge types to it when adding Dreams and Members modules to the ecosystem.\n\nObviously, this is just a quick example and not a full description of what types could exist:\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e6d5b4cf2499857beb8bee0d8f28de589c912298.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"611\">\n\nIn this example, Realities, Dreams and Members have been adding nodes and edges to the same database. Any system can create the Event node and all items created by that system are assigned a relates_to edge to a an event node. Any system can create the User node if it doesn't exist, and it's linked to the SSO. Apart from that different edges and nodes are created by different systems, but they can all see the same data.\n\n* Realities: \n * Nodes: Needs, Responsibilities, TalkDiscussions links\n * Edges: depends_on, fulfils, refers_to, realizes\n* Dreams:\n * Nodes: Dreams\n * Edges: Funded, Created\n* Members:\n * Nodes: Users\n * Edges: has_membership\n\nIt's true that if we for example were to change the identifying label of a node or edge type, we'd have to update all systems, but I find it unlikely that it will happen often, if at all.\n\nAnother thing that becomes possible then is to explore how things fit together by looking at the graph in a GUI like the one I used to generate the image above. We'd have a database that is pretty close to an actual 1-to-1 representation of an organisation.

She has conducted extensive research on multilingual communities in Belize, as well as the role of English within the shifting sociolinguistic economy of gentrifying Berlin. Most recently, she has turned her attention to human-machine interaction. At its core, Britta\u2019s research uncovers the conceptual underpinnings of socio-cultural interaction, the interrelationship of language and belonging and forms of socio-spatial mobility. \n\n \n\nBritta is a member of the [European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)](https://www.cost.eu) and is part of a network of researchers working within its newly approved action [Language in the Human-Machine Era](https://www.cost.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/oc-2019-1_Actions_Booklet-v1.pdf), where she will be in the management committee for Germany and vice-chair of the working group on language attitudes and ideologies.\n\n \n\nBritta and I met for a virtual interview over Skype from our respective apartments in Berlin to discuss her latest research project, \u201cThe Construction of Language in Digital Society\u201d, which examines post-human understandings of \u2018correct\u2019 and \u2018normal\u2019 language use.

(LS: Leonie Schulte, BS: Britta Schneider)\n\n\n**LS:** You are a member of a group of researchers involved in the new European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST), and you will be conducting research as part of the recently approved action, Language in the Human-Machine Era. Can you tell me more about this project and your involvement in it?\n\n**BS:** The network is funded by the European Council. Dave Sayers, a sociolinguist from the UK, brought the project into being and it has just been approved in March 2020. It hasn\u2019t officially started yet, but the idea is to bring together researchers with an interest in language, but with very different disciplinary backgrounds who are, in one way or another, involved with the topic of language and digital communication. This means there are computational linguists, language professionals such as IT programmers, people who study language in education, some who work on language variation, researchers interested in questions of language and law, language endangerment and language rights, and some who study language ideologies, and all in relation to the changes we face with regards to the human-machine era. So, the network is huge and there are several working groups that will realize conferences, meetings or summer schools within the next four years.\n\n**LS:** Alongside your research as part of the COST action, you also launched your own study, \u201cThe Construction of Language in Digital Society\u201d. Could you give me an overview of your project and research aims? \n\n**BS:** For several years now, I have been working on how languages \u2013 as entities \u2013 such as English, or German, or Spanish come into being. So, how the idea of a bounded, separable and static language is constructed by speakers. \n \nI have done research in multilingual environments, and what came out in my last research project in the Caribbean was that the kind of media that is associated with particular languages has significant impact on whether or not people think this language should be regular or standardised. So, if a language has a written tradition, people are much more likely to believe the language has to be fixed and regular: this highlights the crucial impact of the printing press and of writing technologies on our conception of language. I thought it would be very interesting to look at what happens to all of this in digital environments, where we no longer have the printing press as our main technology of producing mediated communication: how does the internet shape our concepts of language and our concepts of linguistic appropriateness, correctness, and standardness?\n\nI thought it would be interesting to start by interviewing people who use Alexa or Siri and other voice-controlled digital assistants to understand how people interact with machines via their voices, and whether they believe they have to standardise their own speech in these interactions; whether they conceptualise these devices as authorities, or whether they experience that these devices learn to handle accents, dialect speech and other \u2018irregularities\u2019.\n\n**LS:** You mentioned language ideologies. When sociolinguists and linguistic anthropologists talk about language ideologies, we describe normative sets of beliefs about the place and function of certain ways of speaking in society. And, of course, there is a long tradition of studying language ideologies within human-to-human interaction, and the ways in which ideologies of language can serve a policing function, dictating notions of correctness and incorrectness, prestige and authority. What do you think are aspects that might be different about the study of language ideologies in machine-human interaction?\n\n**BS:** I think a relevant difference is that the frequency of occurrence of linguistic features in digital contexts plays a much more important role. This contrasts with traditional standards in Western cultures where a small elite of people decide what is correct and what is not correct. These traditional standards were unconceivable without technologies of writing and are still reified and controlled by grammarians, and other elite groups. This concept of written standard language now interacts with frequency: as soon as you have a certain language phenomenon occurring frequently online, then it might, sooner or later, be considered as correct by programmes and devices like Siri and Alexa. Whereas before, correctness might have been based on what appeared in lexicons, or if it appeared in a novel or grammar book \u2013 many written by male, educated, white speakers \u2013 now if certain words and phrases that appear very often, or rather, appear often in forms that machines can read, then they may  *become*  correct even if it would not have been labeled as \u2018correct\u2019 by a lexicon.\n\n**LS:** You touched on this point at the beginning, but just to return to it in a bit more detail, there is a lot of research on how existing social biases and forms of inequality \u2013 for example forms of racial and gender injustice \u2013 are reproduced through algorithmic decision-making. And this is often due in part to the fact that the majority of people programming these algorithms are not representative of the wider population. Do you see any similar patterns with respect to how language ideologies and attitudes might be reproduced in the context of digital assistants? \n\n**BS:** Definitely. Users report to  *adapting*  their speech when they communicate with Alexa, even on a very fine-grained level, so that Alexa will understand them. This implies that Alexa is working with a conception of \u2018correct\u2019 speech that is based on the traditional norms and rules that we find in standardised written languages, and which insufficiently captures the breadth of different forms of speaking: accents, slang, etc. It also has been reported that \u2013 this doesn't appear in my data, but I have read in other studies \u2013 Alexa reacts better to male voices and that the frequencies with which it is programmed expect a male voice. \n\nOne might assume that the more these devices are used, the more capable they are of learning and adapting to some degree. Therefore, the longer people use a device, the more it will be able to understand different speech patterns.\n\nOn the other hand, I also have German speakers in my dataset who report that they use it in English as there is a much larger database on which it draws and can therefore handle variation better in English, making it easier to use rather than in German.\n\n**LS:** So, it\u2019s not only about programmer's explicit or implicit attitudes towards the \u2018correctness\u2019 of a certain language variety, but it also seems to reify the hegemony of English \u2013 and probably Standard British of American English \u2013 as a medium of interaction, thereby making these digital assistants even less accessible to a range of users.\n\n**BS:** Yes, and I think this is an important difference to previous language ideologies from the age of printing, in that we have to factor in both the size of the dataset as well as frequency of occurrence, which may conflict with traditional norms of language correctness.\n\nI can give you an example from a German-English database called [Linguee](https://www.linguee.de), which is an online translation tool. It is based on websites that appear in English and in German. It simply uses a web crawler that looks for English and German websites, and when I used it, it occurred to me that some of the phrases that appear on it sounded pretty German. My hypothesis is if a German translator translates certain texts from German into English, then certain Germanisms will appear that are not necessarily wrong in English, but are unusual. However, if German speakers start to search for particular phrases, for example, \"die Barrieren senken\" or \"to lower the barriers\", which is a common phrase in German, but not so common in English, it still appears as a \u2018normal\u2019 phrase in Linguee because it appears on some websites. And then you have a looping effect of people using it because it appears on Linguee and is therefore considered to be correct, which, in turn, might drive native German speakers to continue using this phrase when they speak English. \n\n In this way, our whole idea of correctness and whose authority this correctness is based on, is further complicated \u2013 which I really like about it.\n\n**LS:** We have been speaking a lot about correctness. Can we unpack this notion a little more before we move on? Where do ideas of correctness come from?\n\n**BS:** I think that the vast majority of people believe there is a form of language that is correct, and that everything else is not correct. And you devote years of teaching and training to learning this one correct way of speaking and writing. From a sociolinguistic or linguistic anthropological view, these notions of correctness are historical artefacts that we can deconstruct and critique: they are simply the language of the powerful, the language of those who were able to label a particular language variety as correct. So, there is nothing intrinsically correct in using a particular kind of relative pronoun or a particular kind of pronunciation. There is also nothing intrinsically incorrect about using a double-negative. It is simply our traditions and conventions that have been regularised in lexicons and grammar books and that have also come to influence the way all digital devices that deal with human language have been programmed.\n\n**LS:** It sounds like you are also identifying a potential in these devices for disrupting these notions of correctness.\n\n**BS:** I think it\u2019s both. At the moment, I would think you have a double- development, where you have a reification of these norms and a destabilisation at the same time.\n\nThere are also cases of programmers explicitly trying to accommodate more variation. I spoke with a programmer who programs Cortana \u2013 the Microsoft voice-controlled digital assistant \u2013 and who worked on a project developing templates for the device in the Saxon German dialect. So, in some cases, as soon as you have an interest \u2013 if you have enough people who use a particular variety \u2013 there will be a capitalist interest in making such devices conform so that more people can use them.\n\nBut again, all of these efforts depend on certain existing power dynamics and inequalities in society. Some speakers may not have that kind of decision-making power and it is very difficult to adapt their speech. Using the standard language variety when interacting with technology can also be a form of symbolic subordination. And in other cases, there will never be a commercial interest in adapting linguistic templates, simply because there are not enough speakers of a particular variety or this variety is in itself more variable because it has no writing tradition or because the speakers themselves are socially marginalized (as for example [*Kiezdeutsch*](http://www.kiezdeutsch.de/aufeinenblick.html) or other multi-ethnic urban forms of speech). In my current study on Alexa users, these are so far only Germans who have been institutionally trained to use standard German and more or less identify with it. It would be important to do more research on more marginalised speakers, also in parts of the world where the idea of homogenous standards is not as dominant as it is in Germany and most other European countries.\n\nCertainly, there is potential to have more language variety in digital assistants, but I don't think it will stay flexible forever. These systems will always be more responsive to the demographically more dominant variety, which is of course, typically a variety that already has had status and prestige for a very long time.\n\n**LS:** What have you been observing with your informants? How are they viewing linguistic authority within these dynamics (if at all)?\n\n**BS:** The speakers I worked with are all speakers of German as a first language and most spoke rather standard varieties of German. None of them really questioned the authority of Alexa and believe that it must know better because it had been programmed, so they adapt their speech. And, of course, also because they want to make the thing work. So, they don't really care. \n\n \nThere was one case where someone reported that she used a local-dialect word for a particular kind of light but Alexa didn't understand and she was frustrated, but in the end, she simply used another word.\n\n \n\nSo, this was not such a core issue for my informants so far, but I did notice that they usually do not believe that Alexa has it wrong. Rather, they believe that they themselves are making mistakes and that they have to adapt their speech. \n\n \n\nAnother interesting aspect is that these devices are given personal names so that users refer to them as though they were people. They also refer to them with personal pronouns that we usually use to refer to humans \u2013 and female humans, in particular. So, it\u2019s always \"she\". Some speakers also use \"it\", but mostly \"she\". The most interesting point, I find, is that some speakers really develop an emotional relationship to their devices.\n\nThis suggests that using sound and voice \u2013 in a very literal sense \u2013 seems to do something to us as humans in contrast to communicating via the keyboard, for example: it facilitates the development of emotional relationships.\n\n**LS:** I am reminded of a very early example from your project that you told me about during one of our meetings last year, of one of your informants who owns many of these devices in her home, and who has, over time, developed emotional relationships with all of them. \n         \nIf I remember correctly, she had different relationships to each of them, and she interacted with them in different ways. Can you tell me a bit more about her relationship to and interaction with her devices?\n\n**BS:** So, in every room in her flat, she had two or three devices \u2013 in each room. And in this case, \"Alexa\" was conceptualised as one person, or let's say, interaction partner. But she had developed different relationships to each of the actual boxes \u2013 the tangible, material boxes \u2013 even though they all use the same voice.\n \nShe had one, for example, where she had put some stickers on it to look like a cat's face. She liked each box and she reported very openly to the fact that she had developed very emotional relationships to each of them. She had a closer relationship to the boxes with which she spoke more frequently: So, there was this one device in the living room that was the main speaker and the others were also speakers, but less important.\n\nShe also had two devices in her bedroom; one that would tell her stories at night to fall asleep, and another box that would play the sound of a fire \u2013 a fireplace. As far as I understood her, she had less of an emotional relationship to the device that would only play the sound of a fireplace than she did to the one that told her stories. \n\nShe also told me about one device in her bathroom that is actually a bit broken, but she still uses it. I thought what she said about that was really interesting. She said, \"this box here has been recovered. She makes a lot more mistakes than the white one in my bedroom, but I let her get away with it. I don't want to give her away even if she has small flaws\". So, of course, she cannot really interact very easily with this one, but she says, \"yeah, I only ask her for the time or the weather\".\n  \nMost of my informants are actually male, middle-aged, work as consultants or something similar, and they often use it in the car during their commutes to and from work. In this way, Alexa is a kind of secretary. And they write emails and do everything they would do from their desk, but in the car \u2013 so it\u2019s more of a practical relationship. In this sense, this one woman was a bit particular in her strong emotional relationship to her devices, but I am sure there are many more people who use it like this, and I think there is a lot of potential \u2013  I don't want to glorify the development of these devices, and I am actually very critical of their development \u2013 but I am very sure there is a lot of potential for elderly people in this, and for people who are alone. Of course, it would be much nicer if everyone had a happy family life and many friends around them, but if someone doesn\u2019t have that, I think it is still better to talk to Alexa than to talk to no one. \n\n**LS:** It sounds like the interaction between people and their devices reproduces relationships that they might have at one point had or relationships that they would like to have \u2013 for example, a man using Alexa as his secretary, or this woman reproducing forms of friendship and support \u2013 so, it\u2019s not like the devices take on completely new functions that are unique to human-machine interaction. \n\n**BS:** I think for all my informants to a certain degree, you can compare the relationship to the relationship you would have with a pet; you have an interaction partner and you want it to do what you say and you have some degree of control over it. But it is somehow there and gives you a feeling of comfort, a feeling that someone or something is there with you.\n\nThis is also interesting linguistically. This particular woman, who I think has a relatively rare relationship to her devices, often signals forms of politeness through her intonation patterns. So, while most of the time you have to use commands when you talk to Alexa \u2013 \"Alexa, switch on the light\", \"switch on the radio\", \"switch it off\" \u2013 she does that, but in a way that sounds very polite, almost intimate. So, she performs friendliness. During the interview she would sometimes demonstrate how she uses Alexa, and she would say things like, \"computer, what time is it?\", and Alexa responded and then she said, \"brav, dass ist meine Alexa\" (\u201cwell done. That's my Alexa\u201d). I think a lot of people do that even if they don't notice. If Alexa does what they ask it to, they will say something like \"ah, gut\" (\u201cvery good\u201d), \"gut gemacht\" (\u201cwell done\u201d) or something. So, there are elements of human-pet-like relationships as well.\n\n**LS:** It\u2019s interesting how there are fluctuating positions of authority in these relationships. On the one hand, they might report that the device has some kind of linguistic authority, so they adapt their speech, but on the other hand you also find these kinds of owner-pet-like relationships.\n\n**BS:** Yeah, I think people are pretty much aware that someone has programmed the device, and when it comes to these notions of authority, they do not believe that Alexa is the authority, they believe the programmer is the authority: the programmer knows best and wouldn\u2019t programme it \u2018incorrectly\u2019.\n\n**LS:** Since we are talking about research design and methodology, I am curious, how much of your data collection is ethnographic? Are you observing interactions between speakers and their devices at home?\n\n**BS:** I have tried, but my informants so far \u2013 German, middle-class \u2013 don't want me to observe them. They also do not want me to audio-record or film them. People often feel like they have to excuse themselves for using Alexa, and they feel a bit shy or say, \"I didn't actually want to have it, it was just included in something\", or, \"it was given to me as a present\". They feel like they have to excuse the fact that they own these devices, because it\u2019s hard to legitimise giving all of your data to Amazon. So that\u2019s been keeping me from doing more ethnographic research, but in some of my interviews people will start using Alexa while I am interviewing them. So, I do have some small, interactional conversational data. I love this kind of data because you can learn a lot about their relationship to the machine from their intonation patterns: for example, how they assert authority through commands, or perform intimacy and friendliness.  \n\n**LS:** Since you are working on the topic of human-machine interaction, have you since acquired one of these devices? Are you doing some sort of auto-ethnography?\n\n**BS:** I haven't acquired one. I feel that this would be a spy in my flat. I experiment a little bit with Siri. Especially in the beginning of the project, I played around with it a bit more, and I discovered some interesting things, especially in regards to the translation of culturally specific concepts, which may point to the reproduction of cultural knowledge in programming. Similar to the Linguee example I gave at the beginning, I found that voice-controlled digital assistants also directly translate culturally specific concepts, which can sometimes be a little confusing. I remember one specific case from last year: I asked Siri, \"what can I give to the children for Christmas?\", and she said, in German, \"Wie w\u00e4re es mit einem h\u00e4sslichen Pullover?\", which is the German equivalent of, \"how about an ugly sweater\". The concept of ugly Christmas sweaters doesn't really exist in Germany, so I didn't understand her answer and I thought it was almost spooky. I thought, what a crazy answer! Why would I give my children an ugly sweater for Christmas?\n\nAt some point, I discussed this with some colleagues and they explained to me that in the US you have this idea of the ugly sweater, which is a Christmas sweater, which I hadn't known. And so, this was just a direct translation of the US-American concept of the ugly sweater.\n\nIt has also been interesting to see how my children interact with digital assistants. In the very beginning, when they first used it, my youngest didn't get the concept of a voice-controlled digital assistant, so she just started to tell Siri stories about her life, like \"I have this little dog and I really like her\" and so on, and Siri would respond, \"sorry, but I can't find this on the internet\". My daughter was really frustrated and said, \"I think Siri is really stupid. Is there a real person sitting on the other end?\".\n         \nSo, that's a really fascinating aspect too; how people adapt to the pragmatic requirements of the devices: which kinds of interactions is the machine able to handle? In the case of a child telling Siri a story, the machine hasn\u2019t been programmed to deal with this; it doesn't know how to react. Interestingly, newer tools also express \u2018emotions\u2019, for example via intonation. What I take from this is that programmers have seen in the data that has been collected that many people try to develop a social and emotional bond with the tool and do not want to only interact on technical matters or search for information on the internet. So the data, I believe, has taught programmers that language is more than a referential tool for representing and sharing information. Returning to my point at the beginning, It is the medium that impacts on what we believe to be \u2018real\u2019 language. And because digital tools can represent sound, in contrast to writing, the role of sound all of a sudden becomes very important, while it was, in the age of literacy, often hidden or assumed to be irrelevant when it came to notions of correctness.", "created_at": "2020-04-16 16:58:58.273648", "updated_at": "2020-12-11 14:49:23.186603", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4301, "wiki": false, "reads": 20, "score": 484.0, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4934, 2915, 4, 6425], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29779, "user_id": 1974, "topic_id": 2942, "post_number": 17, "raw": "@Matthias Thank you for alphabetic order! another question: is it possible somehow to edit machine name (eoe_something_something) when you want to edit a tag? when i do cloning manually, time to time i forget to change the machine name and later there is no way of editing it, so several times i had to delete the tag all together and start anew. it just takes extra time :)\n\nalso, for script for RQDA: do you need me to be completely done with tagging for writing it or it does not matter?\n\n", "created_at": "2014-06-04 08:51:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:43.905725", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 94, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [29707], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24379, "user_id": 1442, "topic_id": 5466, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>old links in this thread + mail notifications</b>\n\n@Nadia: can you update the link on the main message of this thread?\n\n\"Pending tasks\" link\u00a0doesnt work:\u00a0\"/en/opencare/task-6144\" could not be found.\n\n\"how Open Care works\" link doesn't work:\u00a0The requested page \"/en/op3ncare-1\" could not be found.\n\nAnd what happened to mail notifications?

I didn\u2019t mention them because the project needs to be approved before.\n\nThe aim of the hackathon is to improve the quality of public service delivery provided by municipalities. Many actors are recommending solutions but few are focusing on ICT as a method to solve the challenges cities are facing, that\u2019s why it is called a \u201cSmart City\u201d hackathon.\n\nThe innovation we are bringing here is that it is the first time that a Hackathon takes municipalities as a subject and connects them to problem solvers among citizens. Second, also for the first time, we will be mixing municipalities representatives with developers in the same team and this will be of a great impact even after the end of the event.\n\nTo be more specific, our goal is to come out with ICT based ideas that would boost the work of municipalities in the following activities which, if improved, can make the life of citizens a way better: waste management, parking management, infrastructure management, energy conservation regarding public lighting, providing building permits, tax collection, revenues \u2018ads collection etc. Who doesn\u2019t want waste to be collected on time, building permits to get faster, waiting time on queues reduced, constructions deadlines to be respected, green sites to be increased, historical sites to be preserved, citizens be more involved etc? Maybe there are easy ways to improve that but municipalities they don\u2019t see it because they already have a huge workload? Maybe they need help from fresh minds who think outside of the box?\n\nGood examples can be found within municipality of Kairouan which implemented an app to monitor the garbage collection and municipality of Djerba that is using GIS (Geographic Information System) tool to empower interaction with citizens.\n\nThe first step will be to launch the call for participation online, meanwhile the selection of coaches, mentors and jury will take place. The objective is to have at least 10 teams. Each team is composed of 3 to 4 members and it is required to have at least one developer among its members.\n\nIn the first day, the 24h challenge will start with the representatives of the three municipalities who will express their biggest challenges to participants, who will then have the opportunity to ask them questions before choosing which problem they will work on. Right after, we will invite some municipalities who have already integrated ICT-based solutions in their processes and showcase them as examples. This will be followed by a design thinking training session for all teams to help them in the ideation. After that, the timer will be on and teams will start working on a prototype that represents their solutions. There will be mentors to give them pieces of advice.\n\nIn the second day, there will be a pitch training and after that, teams will pitch their ideas in front of a jury panel composed of municipalities\u2019 representatives and ICT experts. The event ends with the announcement of the three winning teams.\n\nWell, with the new wave of #Peoplewant movement that is taking place after the presidential elections, we are not only providing to citizens a real platform where then can have direct interactions with their municipalities but also a safe place where they can turn their recommendations into reality while feeling involved.\n\nThe success of our first event will result in the replication of this model in other municipalities. In fact, we consider that our work won\u2019t end up there. We will rely on municipal councils and sponsors support to provide seed capital to the different winners and we will work with other partners on the incubation phase.\n\nThe team behind this challenge is me Ahmed Hadhri, a community builder who co-launched two coworking spaces in Tunis, organized several events and has been very active in the Tunisian entrepreneurship ecosystem.

After re-reading the text of the call, it seems we are on top of it, more than ever, and it would make no sense at all not to re-iterate CCCP. Also, there are going to be five funded projects instead of three. However, the question of why it was so poorly evaluated remains. We would need some intelligence around that proposal... As for how to improve it, we could give it more of an education spin. And I would love to involve Dorsaf and Yosser: \n\n> In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged.\n\n* **Open schooling and collaboration on science education**. Interesting in and of itself. But this seems to me more of an innovation than a research action. Not clear what we, as SSNA researchers, could do: maybe only evaluate and reflect on the kind of stuff that Winnie likes to do. Doable; but this would probably be a relatively small project for us, given that the overall budget is 1.5M and most of it should go to actual schooling innovation. \n\n* **Drivers and contexts of violent extremism in the broader MENA region and the Balkans**. *Very* relevant, especially as it latches nicely onto our consulting activities. ER has some track record of operating in the region, and we could try to mount something with either UNDP or the WB. OICD will probably apply, right?\n\n* **Social and economic effects of migration in Europe and integration policies**. Also a fantastic challenge. It can be argued that this is one issue where ethnography has a role to play, as it helps embattled policy makers understand \"what migration looks like from out here\". I'd love to work on this with economists: ethno + eco could be a nice combo on this issue.\n\n* **Innovative solutions for inclusive and sustainable urban environments**. I am personally interested in cities, and love this topic. I see a collaboration with Milano and an involvement of Sander (co-author of the famous work on scaling in cities spearheaded by Bettencourt & West \u2013 massive academic firepower). Our focus could be on coops, collectives, co-housings, but also their economic models (\"new and participatory models of growth that foster sustainable and equitable prosperity\"). \n\n* **Enhancing social rights and EU citizenship**.

The project is entitled \"Making the Citizens Voice Heard\" (VOICE) and the main idea is to:\n\n*\"understand the opportunities for developing democracy in the era of the 4th Industrial Revolution, to make use of its empowering technology and to consider how these changes can shift the current mainstream balance point between democracy and representation. The approach taken is an experimental and bottom-up one; we wish to identify, develop and implement pilot approaches with a clear citizen engagement dimension and a multiplier effect, and then to lay out atop of this, a detailed theoretic framework providing better insight on what \u2018more democracy\u2019 can eventually mean and how it can manifest.\"*\n\nIn February, @alberto drafted an idea of how we could contribute (you can find it [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gK06a9VD03VZOATvccEH-Wb5fr1MHE_HR6dj8Wpj1eo/edit)). The entire proposal and the WP descriptions together with the budget was taken care by the coordinator and we have now been given the (almost) final version. You can find it [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1OVCfY5sMvDFFW3vqhw_PEP7udFFRQW4A). \n\nWe will be using the SSNA to respond to the objective of \"technology research\" to understand and illustrate how technology can empower and diversify the proliferation of democratic practice. The topic is very close to both POPREBEL and NGI so we could build upon the existing community already on the platform. \n\nOn the other hand, there is not a lot of space for negotiation at this point and we weren't asked for a lot of input in the process. \n\nThe total budget of the project is 3 million eur. It is quite fixed as we are a lot of partners. We have been attributed approx. 160k. Duration: 36 months.\n\nWe are not leading any of the workpackages, but we have PMs allocated for all 5 WPs (20 PMs in total). The only task that we are leading is T4.4. exploitation of results and we have only one deliverable, related to this task and the follow-up of VOICE. \n\nA part from the budget to participate in the consortium meetings, we don't have extra budget for travel to organize the usual onboarding events. We weren't asked to have them either, but as this is an important part of our \"standard\" workpackage, I will get back to the coordinator and suggest we revise this in the negotiation phase if the project is approved. \n\nIf you have any thoughts or comments please let me know as soon as possible since the planned date for the submission is this Friday. \n\n@nadia @johncoate @matthias @amelia @noemi @hugi ...", "created_at": "2020-03-02 15:49:45.265379", "updated_at": "2020-03-02 16:33:08.522644", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 508, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 128.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4022, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 48345, "user_id": 4729, "topic_id": 8974, "post_number": 3, "raw": "[quote=\"anique.yael, post:1, topic:8974\"]\n\"developing a more human-centric Internet supporting values of openness, cooperation across borders, decentralisation, inclusiveness and protection of privacy\n[/quote]\n\nHi two projects that might be of interest to this strand\n\n* The SAFE Network is an open source, decentralized data storage and communications network that replaces data centers and servers with the spare computing resources of its users.\nThis video is a pretty good intro: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&v=U1ffmf6z50E\n\nIf you have any questions there's a really friendly forum https://safenetforum.org\n\n--------------------------------------\n\n*  Scuttlebutt/ Manyverse is a decent(ralised) secure gossip platform  small hermies love\nsea-slang for gossip - a scuttlebutt is basically a watercooler on a ship.\nhttps://www.scuttlebutt.nz\n\nManyverse is a social network mobile app with features you would expect: posts, threads, likes, profiles, etc. But it's not running in the cloud owned by a company, instead, your friends' posts and all your social data live entirely in your phone.\nhttps://www.manyver.se", "created_at": "2018-11-06 13:01:54.820255", "updated_at": "2018-11-06 13:03:57.894005", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 171, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 22.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [46880], "is_reply_to": [46880], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 56375, "user_id": 4683, "topic_id": 10314, "post_number": 5, "raw": "I would agree with @alberto regarding the approach: 'through established particiant'.", "created_at": "2019-07-09 07:48:41.979353", "updated_at": "2019-07-09 07:48:41.979353", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 11, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 26.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [56344], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 69255, "user_id": 6078, "topic_id": 12498, "post_number": 4, "raw": "@HIBA & @saif.eddine.laalej check Xlox's post here", "created_at": "2020-01-23 22:01:56.995621", "updated_at": "2020-01-23 22:01:56.995621", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 9, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 47.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5860, 6132], "is_private": false}, {"id": 78035, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 3922, "post_number": 9, "raw": "That thing is just a template that people can edit as they feel makes sense.

The money quote (emphasis mine):\n\n> A European Union-funded initiative called Eunomia has contracted various thinktanks, tech groups, and Fediverse evangelists to help with a new social credit scoring system. The system will be applied to social media and the federated destinations using blockchain technology. It will be governed by a crowdsourced system where groups rank up and rank down the trust levels of information. **In simple terms, it\u2019s an adaptation of China\u2019s social credit scoring system for the Fediverse**. Well, someone working on the project leaked some chat logs, and it reveals a rather antagonistic nature from the people working on the project toward the users who are skeptical of this EU funded project. [..] This obviously didn\u2019t seem like an innocuous project from the EU especially given the Union\u2019s recent anti-freedom of speech initiatives like [Article 11 and Article 13](https://www.oneangrygamer.net/2019/03/article-11-and-article-13-have-passed-public-list-made-available-of-politicians-who-voted-for-bills/80963/). [...] **Why is a social scoring system even needed for social media if users didn\u2019t ask for it?**\n\nNote the reference to the Fediverse. One of the partners is Eugen \u201cGargron\u201d Rochko, the creator of Mastodon. It seems reasonable to deduce that there is quite some trust to rebuild, and that suggests a lot of listening in NGI, and not so much speaking.\n\nAnd a question to @johncoate.

I can see myself hiring you, or somebody like you.\n\nHaving said that, is it not kind of a stretch, even for a brilliant out-of-the-box thinker, to be \"the guy who owns history\" in a problem solving team? History is a big place, and bringing precious metals home heated the Spanish economy during the Siglo de Oro, but it seemed to go well enough for the Roman Empire's for a very long time. Could this result in an early modern historian not recommending exploiting silver mines, just as his ancient historian semi-colleague does recommend it? Do historians exist that know so much about so much of global human history that they could indeed be employed as human repositories of general-purpose historical knowledge?\n\n", "created_at": "2012-03-22 13:32:47", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:22.882831", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 247, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24484, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1334, "post_number": 11, "raw": "<b>Cultural issues </b>\n\nHello Ampat, hoping you are doing well.\n\nFor your information, here is the latest paper, just out of the press!

Let me rephrase this in more algorithmic terms:\n\n* You sort responsibilities according to people (it seems responsibilities are not shared, which makes the overall problem easier) p1:[r11, r12, r13, ...], p2: [r21, r22, r23, ...], p3: ...\n* You map responsibilities using a \"circular\" algorithm (you'll find them in the literature, if you know how to handle Tulip, you can easily and quickly prototype all of it), nodes being mapped on a circle in the above order r11, r12, r13, ..., r21, r22, ... each rij being assigned a (rho, theta) value (polar coordinates). Deciding on the diameter of the circle is a mater of readability (size of nodes, padding between nodes, etc.)\n  * Inducing variations (being more or less \"on\" the circle\", distance between people being non uniform) can make things trickier\n* Map person at the barycenter of their responsibilities (mean of a person's responsibilities theta values), with greater radius so people sit on an outer circle.\n* Similarly map unclaimed responsibilities on an inner circle, in no particular order\n\nVoil\u00e0 !\n\nThat being said, you may want to keep the artistic look of the drawing and avoid having responsibilities aligned on a circle and vary things. As in your drawing, you may want to push some responsibilities further away a person closer to the center. This can save space to have a more compact drawing. But optimizing that kind of criteria is hard. Furthermore, you may want to optimize the order in which people are ordered to have a more readable map when introducing the \"Guides\" and \"Depends_on\" edges. Makes the whole a bit more complex, nothing unfeasible, you then enter the edge crossing minimization problem, a classic.\n\nNow, the incoming and outgoing dependencies thing could also inspire another avenue to process the data -- this all depends how much you need responsibilities to sit right in front of the people that claim them. I would be curious to draw the dependencies graph using a hierarchical layout (I am assuming there are no cycle in your graph, dependencies), introducing people around this dependency graph. This might offer an alternative view on things -- you may simply want to draw both views and alternate between them (\u00e0 la Detangler).\n\nHope this helps\n\nGuy", "created_at": "2019-05-31 06:01:30.260967", "updated_at": "2019-05-31 06:03:41.730102", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 483, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 113.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 4022], "is_private": false}, {"id": 39065, "user_id": 104, "topic_id": 7589, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Yes, I am very interested in this subject!

Unavoidable when you grow in size, but definitely to be improved upon.\n\nNow that we are going through a growth phase with our own organisations, we absolutely want to maintain our cost efficiency. And importantly, fairly pay the people doing the actual work firstly. I'd like to explore: how do we ensure this through organisation infrastructures?\n\nIt further ties into other discussions we are having at the Festival, such as our panel [The Edge of Funding](https://edgeryders.eu/t/main-session-the-edge-of-funding/6427).", "created_at": "2017-09-28 13:06:00.653295", "updated_at": "2017-09-28 13:06:00.653295", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 355, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 513.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31001, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 1712, "post_number": 41, "raw": "<b>@ Nirgal, Dante</b>\n\nYou are both very pertinent in your questions and observations, and this really is the momentum to advance what we started at Lote and Edgecamp. Starting this summer Edgeryders platform becomes a take off space for great initiatives and people coming together.. with or w/out other CoE specific goals.\u00a0 we are a community, \u00a0more and more a self-organizing one, and the Council will in no way hinder our activities.. of course we can meet, of course you can start planning the meetup, make it a general call. unfortunately at the moment there's no money to support precisely that.\n\n<strong>However, to answer Dante's question, as part of the initial plan is and remains building a good \u00a0collaboration between the community and the team of professionals/ researchers now working to make sense of our experiences and find connections with policy work</strong>. we all are still thinking which channel could work best, and perhaps that <a href=\"http://pad.telecomix.org/pelgutus\">etherpad</a> will work, I don;t remember who suggested it but it seemed at Lote people wanted to edit simultaneously. too soon to tell though, and it's not set in stone IMO, but it can be if more and more people start using it and it works. So stay insured you and us all will be part of the whole research process as we are going to work on the documents. Plus, Nadia and Malcolm are looking into whether we could produce 2 documents - 1 entirely by the community. \u00a0\n\n<u>Regarding the edgeryders platform and potential messyness</u>, I actually see this as our home. true, not perfect, but I find it easier to follow content in here than on several google docs, etherpads and pirate pads: for example the discussion below on creating a formal organization/ association has been continued by Darren here, but with no guarantee that ppl see it: https://lite.co-ment.com/text/PtlReql6guK/view/\n\nThe solution for me would be post mission reports per subject and add the link to a wiki editing doc in there, so that people find a way to access it, at the same time continuing discussions in the thread to be visible for everyone on Edgeryders. According to settings, you can be notified via email when a new post or comment is uploaded.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-07-02 15:40:58", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:50.543434", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 408, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [13178], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32156, "user_id": 1543, "topic_id": 5108, "post_number": 27, "raw": "<b>swamped but still on it...</b>\n\nI'm a bit swamped now, as I have a delivery tomorrow, but will catch up this weekend.\n\nI kept working a bit on our stuff with <a href=\"/u/dora\">@dora</a>, though, we now can get the different languages for each page too (not sure it is the same solution which <a href=\"/u/maxlath\">@maxlath</a> mentioned; we used the <a href=\"https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Langlinksei=HUKhVqKZNsj8aaG0sYgB\">langlinks</a> argument from MediaWiki's API).\n\nAlso, we started implementing a MongoDB client, to try use solutions compatible with what was used already and to figure out what is the best way to store the mined data, according to how we'll use it at MoN.\n\nIn the <a href=\"https://github.com/FuturoAnteriore/visualizing-self-diagnosis/tree/dev-moe/src/python\">repo I linked above</a>, I pushed a few more scripts and the first attempt to re-organize the code in the form of a tool to ease the data collection step.

For years, I have been deeply involved in [The Borderland](http://theborderland.se), which is now dealing with what to do about Covid-19. We strictly don't have to cancel yet. In contrast to other events, we don't have any running costs and our community is quite used to dealing with uncertainty \u2013 in 2018 we relocated the entire event in just 6 weeks after losing our location.\n\nThe Borderland is a lot more decentralized in its governance than the other events. I [spoke about this at length at CCCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjQzpGkTpHY) last year. What is interesting is to see how things play out in a crisis like this.\n\n1. On February 29th, @brooks is still hoping that the event will happen but raises the issue that it will be a very different year with an increased [need for hygiene awareness](https://talk.theborderland.se/d/xN5umBKy/need-hygiene-awareness). \n\n2. During the discussion on March 1st, it becomes evident that things are getting worse quickly and that we don't really know [what the force majeure policy is, so the thread is forked](https://talk.theborderland.se/d/tlz9P2x4/force-majeure-policy-for-the-borderland). This thread goes on while the crisis is unfolding and is the only place in which the Borderland as an organization is doing its sensemaking, and doing it transparently.\n\n3. On March 29th, [the treasurer Jonas starts gathering advice](https://talk.theborderland.se/d/CK0XeGc6/freeze-of-non-committed-spending-until-30th-april) on a proposal to stop all spending until April 30th, as to not spend money that we may want to use for reimbursements. \n\n4. As other events cancel, the Borderland takes its time. There is no need to rush as there are no running costs and no contracts are signed until the end of April. On March 30th [the chair of the board, Diana, makes a post](https://talk.theborderland.se/d/tlz9P2x4/force-majeure-policy-for-the-borderland/61) to make clear the discussions on the board.

Hope it can be interesting and useful.\n\n1. To zoom out and add a key aspect I want to encourage engaging on a systemic level in the procurement process. As any procurement is relevant to Open Source Sweden and its members they would gain from contributing to opening up the procurement system in Sweden. It is currently one of the most proprietary and closed processes in Europe. I did a webinar at work which you can find [here](https://entryscape.com/sv/portfolio-item/webinar-hur-undviker-vi-korruption-och-bluffakturor/) about how the current closed private monopoly enables fraud and can foster corruption worse than other European countries. Sweden does not have a central open public database for procurement processes and the private monopoly was just [sold](https://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/visma/pressreleases/visma-saeljer-tvaa-produktomraaden-inom-inkoep-och-upphandlingsloesningar-3053811). The current situation stifles competition and effective use of tax money. You can contact the [Open Up!](https://openup.open-knowledge.se/) project by [Open Knowledge Sweden](https://se.okfn.org/) and [DIGG](https://digg.se/) to support this systemic shift which in turn can support the uptake of procuring open source solutions and public cloud services respecting citizen rights without e.g. [Google Analytics](https://webperf.se/articles/google-analytics-offsekt/).\n\n2.\nA: If a public cloud service respects citizen rights and complies with e.g. GDPR and Schrems and is more efficient hardware wise than an on-premise solutions it can be better use of tax money.\nB: I believe that the public cloud services in Sweden should be hosted in Sweden especially considering the capacity and competency but also service providers which respects and encourages digital rights.\nC. From what I read so far there hasn't really been anyone daring to say what's OK and what's not and a lot of public sector bodies are using public cloud services and it's user services which really can be questioned legally.\nD: As @alberto wrote I believe choosing FLOSS can enable and encourage long-term fostering, learning and development of local skills in comparison to voluntarily braindraining one's own community/municipality/region/nation.\nE: Economy, trust and engagement in the current shape of representative democracy. I believe that the time up until now has decreased all three of these aspects, at least with [Swedish Transport Agency scandal](https://upphandling24.se/bristande-kunskap-bakom-transportstyrelsens-it-skandal/). \nF: I think it's gain or drain kind of scenario. My analysis right now of the Swedish situation is that we're only scratching of the surface of our digital potential partly due to the systemic issue (see 1.) regarding procurement. It's also important to teach the procurers and people working in public sector regarding the pros and cons about home built on-premise solution and public cloud which is something my colleagues wrote a white paper about [here](https://entryscape.com/en/portfolio-item/cloud-vs-in-house-solutions-for-open-data/) as some might view public cloud as dangerous and see homegrown solutions as gratis when they in reality can cost a lot more of employees' and consultants' time and work.", "created_at": "2020-12-15 20:20:36.912180", "updated_at": "2020-12-21 19:14:29.158039", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 538, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 36.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5025, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 67061, "user_id": 5347, "topic_id": 12105, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Odlicne ideje! \nSmatram da je jako vazno malde ukljuciti u zajednice.

This work of building a narrative bridge requires collective intelligence as the challenges we face are far too difficult for any one person or small group of people to tackle alone. The second reason for trying to do this in a participatory manner is that gaining a shared understanding of issues is a key enabler for building shared solutions together as communities and societies.</span>\n\n<span>Let\u2019s be creative about how our individual projects and work can work together to make a bright future happen for [ add name of your country here]! </span>Many people are doing a great job already, but there is a lot left to do for all of us :) So we invite you to submit your thoughts about how can we organize ourselves for progress in [add name of country here]?

Feel inspired \u2013 but not limited \u2013 by the following questions: \n\n* Who are people who get good things done in [ad name of Country here] (people running good projects)?\n\n* What can others learn about [add name of Country here] by getting to know their work?\n\n* How can we build and support new collaborations between these and other people doing good work? Aspects to discuss include current challenges they are facing and how they could be solved together...\n\n* How can <span>[add name of Country here] </span>\u2019s social innovators and creative problem solvers stick together and work on other issues? How can they organize themselves to not be compromised by struggles over money?\n\n* How can we continue to practice the unity that many showed after [add important event in country here], helping without regard for gender, religion, ethnicity or social class?\n\n##How to submit your contribution?\n\n1.

Free commercial tools such as Google Hangouts allow individuals with a common learning objective, but living in different geographical locations, to form close mutually supportive learning communities. We have found that one of the most significant barriers to online learning are the isolation, confidence and communication issues of potential learners. Tackling this problem is a core objective of the Viral Academy.\n\nHowever the Viral Academy is not just about online learning, the methodology is just as applicable to physical space. Viral Academy courses can be taught in traditional classroom settings, or more informal spaces. This practice is what is know as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip_teaching\">Flip teaching or flipped classrooms</a>, and has been shown to have <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303759604579093400834738972?mg=reno64-wsj&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424052702303759604579093400834738972.html\">significantly better course completion rates</a> when applied to online courses.\n\nWe believe that it is not necessary to think of courses as either online, or offline. This conceptual separation of online learning versus physical classes is not helpful. Of course online resources and interaction is part of education. The question is what is the best way to integrate these experiences. In the Viral Academy we encourage small groups to get together in physical space and to team up with individual online students, or even another team of two or three students sitting together at another location. The teamwork can then take place by having a video projector at each physical space enabling a natural dialogue between both remote participants and the person sitting next to you.

By small we mean groups of less than ten people. Based on our present experience, it seems that team sizes of around six people seem the most effective. Each group learns together, and is supported by a facilitator (an agile teacher), and resourced by online experts.

It works well, records and gives you both a video/audio file and an audio file, I think in .wav format (windows native).  This audio file is the one you want if you are going to get a transcript made or want to make a podcast. \n\nPodcasts are only viable if they are edited with a good quality editing program. I use Adobe Audition, which I acquired in my radio days. It allows me to do pretty much anything with the file. I only know a fraction of what it can do, but I use it to get rid of the \"um\" and \"you know\" (we all do it!), false starts to a sentence, get rid of loud background noises if possible, and I also use it to raise or lower the volume in any given stretch.  And I can make the audio speed up or slow down if needed.  This stuff is time consuming with a good program.  With a basic app, not realistic - takes forever.\n\nThat that makes it even more critical to get a good take on the first and likely only try.\n\nThe following applies to _all_ participants in a recorded conversation:\nFind a room with good wifi that is away from street noise and other people talking, pets, all the usual stuff.  If those noises happen while your guest is talking, you can't get rid of it.  So choose the setting carefully.\n\nHeadsets with decent mics work well enough. The better the set, naturally the better the sound. But even the white Apple headphone mic/sets are much better than using a laptop or phone mic.  Always use mics that can get close to your mouth.  Forget that your laptop or phone even has a mic.\n\nIf you are using a mic on a stand, keep your voice within 1-2 hand widths away and don't talk straight into the mic, talk just above it so the \"P\"s don't puff and other breathy attributes.  Uniform volume is important.\n\nThe advice above about being prepared is excellent and essential.  If prepared you won't have long gaps where you grope around for something to say.  \n\nEven when the conversation get energetic, don't talk over each other.  Let the other person finish. If you are using Zoom you can agree on hand signals saying \"I want to talk\" or \"I'm done talking\"\n\nDon't talk too fast, enunciate clearly, and don't finish a sentence by either speeding up or tapering off in volume. This is more common than you might think.\n\nI have been using the otter.ai service for transcribing. It's free and easy to use and does a surprisingly decent job. But unless editing is a fun activity to you, the cleaner the copy the less time you will spend fixing the stuff the machine got wrong.  And the machine will put every \"you know\" in there, which you will have to remove, but the ums don't usually get transcribed.  I guess they know to listen for it.  Good thing too.\n\nThe transcription also gives you a chance to clean up the copy for readers.  Writing usually can be spoken and recorded \"as is\" and make reasonable sense, or even perfect sense if the wrting is good enough.   \n\nBut talking converted into writing is more problematic.  Often someone starts to make a point or gets halfway through a sentence and then decides to either start over or change course mid-sentence.  To a listener this can be disconcerting, and ultimately tiring, if the speaker does it a lot.  If one reads a verbatim transcript of a lot of such talk patterns, it just won't make enough sense to plow through it.  Another good reason to talk with the person ahead of time is to get a feeling for the other person's style and habits of talking and try to adjust for them.", "created_at": "2019-10-02 22:59:16.115318", "updated_at": "2019-10-15 16:40:02.602087", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 685, "wiki": true, "reads": 7, "score": 21.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [60441], "is_reply_to": [60441], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30945, "user_id": 2551, "topic_id": 4470, "post_number": 24, "raw": "<b>Who is the proposal going to?</b>\n\nIf you don't know them personally or it is a goverment/EU thing I would recommend to make sure the buzzword bingo (du jour!) will be completed. If you can - cram in what you really want to do between the lines as well. Perhaps have very tidy diagram that get some info across (but mostly that you can be trusted to make tidy diagrams for deliverables). Sorry for sounding cynical. In my opinion the art of the thing is to manage to cover both angles.\n\nMany funding agencies have the aim to \"kick lose\" another 5-10 unit of money for each invested. You may want to communicate something in that direction (generation of real economy/ option not to have to pay this or that expense).\n\nOne angle I could imagine as well is to do a bit of intercultural work on top of the actual content by doing seminars for the (many) newly arrived refugees. I think that wouldn't hurt.\n\nAbout the development - very few Good Things you can do today will show a ROI (that you can measure reliably and quantitatively) any time soon. Especially on a budget. With immaterial things, like learning, this may be a bit better. Perhaps you could also look through the available citizen science projects - there are a bunch of cool ones in the UK! http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/podcasts/naked-scientists/show/20130924/nocache/1/?tx_nakscishow_pi1[transcript]=1\n\nThere was a project that uses an app to make fine happiness maps - that got me thinking perhaps you can find a project that tries to work out new metrics for a \"sensible economy\".

I think there may be <em>some </em>truth to that, however it cuts both ways: If you have people doing (or being nudged to do) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_deviance\">positive deviance</a>, that goes beyond the social norms in a good way - you can subtly improve the social fabric.

Something I wanted to start is to take a small bicycle pump with me and do 30 second fix-ups on other people's bikes. Riding bikes is a Good Thing. So helping people to do that is helping us all, even though no one can catch a profit (so what, it turned 30s of waiting into some exercise and perhaps a nice conversation).

On the other hand, this is still rather new for us; I do not think it is a bad thing that people (team leaders + me) keep a human eye on the proceedings. I mean, at the end of the day we *need* to check manually all that stuff. The reporting is a management tool: I spent quite some time looking at it. How much time did we allocate to WP1? How much to WP2? Do we still have enough time budgeted for WP3 next year? Are we underspending? And so on. \n\nI don't trust full automation just yet (as in: people input their time, then we sign off to it and pay them, and the reporting spreadsheet is automatically generated and submitted). I imagine a system in which team leaders look at timesheets and invoices before approving them; then, generate the PDFs and sign them. At this point, we ran the API query, generate the quarterly spreadsheet and take a good look at it. If there is anything funny, we notice and go back to the person who under- over-reported her time, and ask for an explanation.\n\nThe goal, in my head, is not what you call \"full IT\". It is going _paperless_: not have to keep around sheets of paper for five years after the projects end. We could achieve that just with an electronic signature tool. On top of that, the automatic filling of the spreadsheet is a bonus, but I don't care about it being authoritative.

Then people add the event program points that they would like to explore in more detail. Each propgram point can be targeted towards the audience of the organisers choice - which also means everyone is free to organise an event in any language they want. As you can see here there are several different topics within the livelihoods theme: https://edgeryders.eu/t/summit-program/13402\n\nI think the Polish landing page should be focused on one topic of discussion. Think of it as a \"copy\" of one of the events from the program, but adapted to the Polish context - even in terms of what the focus is. So if we choose healthcare, when we put together the text for the Polish language session we have to be mindful that the challenges related around healthcare in Poland are different from those in e.g Germany. I suggested healthcare because there is already a Polish langage discussion happening around the topic, and we also from other places have many stories of interesting and inspiring solutions people are doing on the ground in response to failures in either market or state-based provision of health or social care support. But there are others - Food is one example\n\n**On a more general note:** \n\nOn the landing page it could possibly be useful to have a few lines describing how this event is connected to the other events happening on other topics and in different languages (English, French, German, Italian etc).\n\nThey are part of a  bigger program where people in different parts of Europe are organising different discussions on different topics in different languages. Each session is properly documented with thorough notes in writing that we then publish on the online forum for the event. Regardless of which event they participate in, they get access to the online forum where all the notes from all the different sessions are published.

I cannot be enthused enough about practising Ethnography, the study of lived cultures, and weaving together the various stories and contributions to culture people have. I have a strong background in Popular Music ethnography with my current PhD being centred around an Ethnography of the music scene in Portland, Oregon. I have previously conducted ethnographies of the Eurovision Song Contest (for my MA thesis which was awarded a distinction), the Leeds Music Forum website and have been a consultant ethnographer for the BBC's BBC Radio 3's Connected Studio project. I have also had extensive experience with interviewing through my freelance web based and broadcast journalism with a speciality in World and Folk musics. Throughout my work I have a strong ethical framework to empower the contributors who are essentially at the centre of the produced reports. I am merely a conduit, a vessel which connects the opinions and ideas of others to make observations on cultural habitation. In regards to this project I am excited by the new challenges presented with a chance to apply to my own ethnographic experience to a new but not unfamiliar field. I have already through my PhD research explored and encountered citizen-driven innovation with specific regard to the music scene in Portland, OR. I am intrigued to see how citizens of the particular nations involved: Egypt, Georgia and Armenia respond and interact with the aims of this project all being nations with rich histories and centres for young fresh innovations that are shaping our post-post-modern world. I feel I am suitable for the role of ethnographer on the project as although I may be young I feel I am part of a generation of fresh and innovative ethnographers who are helping shape the discipline around the post-industrial and creative world. I am a fast learner with technology and can find myself flexible and adaptable to many situations. I am active in various creative forum based communities with interests in creative and democratic thought for example I am a member of a forum community built around the website Nationstates in which one can create their own nation and build and develop its own democratic thought through measured online roleplaying of situations. I am proactive, engaging and ethical.

When the shake got longer than expected we would run out to the backyard and some of us would shut the electricity off. \u00a0\n\nBut things changed, in schools now they teach you to leave out, and drills are done city-wide (my last was last year).

What would a revolutionary change to social dynamics look like? What does it mean to live communally, to live decentralised. Issues around space, money, fitness, self defence, mental health and care. Taking care of the next generations.\n\n<em><strong>Talking points</strong></em>\n\n<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-68973d5d-5fc0-7afd-0100-3fdcc57bfcff\">Gehan: </b>How do you reduce transactional nature of working together and introduce a more creative balance, that benefits everyone living in a communal space - what else happens when we bring insights together.\n\n<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-68973d5d-5fc0-7afd-0100-3fdcc57bfcff\">Nadia: </b>How about modelling a space, see what goes on in virtualizing a design - learning by doing? Travelling in Morocco, looking for a space for MENA co-living space. Found a place in tiny town called Tarfaya - house to rent at 300 eur/ month - plans to set the space up there in Morocco. Desire to organise an OpenVillage Camp and New Years Party in December. Working with locals - surfboards out of mycelia, recycling, collaborating, etc. 250 km of beach.\n\n<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-68973d5d-5fc0-7afd-0100-3fdcc57bfcff\">Gehan: </b>What would autonomy look like? Hard to consider when we are so enmeshed in the oppressive structures that surround us? What would an autonomous village look like is an interesting way to map \u2018what would autonomy look like\u2019 - asking the question in the context of a village would make an interesting session.\n\n<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-68973d5d-5fc0-7afd-0100-3fdcc57bfcff\">Kate: </b>Know many communities being set up across the world with different underlying values - there is not one way of doing autonomy - many groups have splintered due to work ethics, difference of values, sex related issues - many, many, diverse communities are trying to come to life at this moment and have power to shift these structures that are crippling the life in many. For OpenVillage - how do the three strands come together? In a very pragmatic mode - want things to exist that can be useful for others, can be used by people who are not there. Need to use the energy available in the right way and be as powerful and communicative as possible.\n\n<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-68973d5d-5fc0-7afd-0100-3fdcc57bfcff\">Noemi: </b>Some communal values shared among many people, no matter where we go. Even though we\u2019ve been doing many conversations, we can say we want to build the village - but we can\u2019t say what artifacts or objects will come out of that. It will either take one to lead the others, or allows ourselves the time and space to think where the convergences will occur.\n\n<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-68973d5d-5fc0-7afd-0100-3fdcc57bfcff\">Nadia: </b>Brief introduction to The Reef (nice acoustics) - have the space for at least a year - this is where we should model a caring environment that we can take into new spaces. Need for care v.s. desire to care. People could bring their skills - those doing holistic practices can figure out how to bring it into the routine of a day - those who do nutrition, can do the same; preventive care, healing therapy, how to care for severely autistic people? What skills need to be developed, what artifacts need to be there? Could the event be centered on design organisation?\n\n<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-68973d5d-5fc0-7afd-0100-3fdcc57bfcff\">Nadia: </b>Look at places\u00a0where health and care belong, look\u00a0at the connective tissue between the two.\n\n<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-68973d5d-5fc0-7afd-0100-3fdcc57bfcff\">Gehan: </b>Giving people an experience of what a healthy environment looks like.

Like the idea of \"connected tissue\".\n\n<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-68973d5d-5fc0-7afd-0100-3fdcc57bfcff\">Noemi: </b>Q for Kate - have you participated in an event experience where you saw people come together in a way that made sense and was collaborative. What format did you feel was worth looking into?\n\n<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-68973d5d-5fc0-7afd-0100-3fdcc57bfcff\">Kate: </b>Many! Done a lot of opening up my own house for free form, non\u00a0choreographed meetings. Has often led to projects. Assessing whether the projects have had a meaningful impact - things that feel very creative and symbiotic may not be particularly socially powerful. Hard thing to realise - conversely, many meetings that might not have \u2018felt good\u2019 had a more direct meaningful impact. Talked with people working with water, arose naturally from a group of people who already working with water in the area - hard way to trick this into happening in a certain environment. Been to creative, festive gatherings too - but not particularly drawn to at this moment in life - more drawn to education and thinking. As much as Burning Man etc are appealing, there is something particularly worldly and serious in terms of the approach to care and governing - there is a level of structure that is going to be helpful.\n\n<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-68973d5d-5fc0-7afd-0100-3fdcc57bfcff\">Noemi: </b>Reason this is going to be a festival and not a conference - things either emerge or not out of the event - more interested in the extra layer we can add in terms of festivities and artifacts that express what Open Village is about. \u00a0\n\n<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-68973d5d-5fc0-7afd-0100-3fdcc57bfcff\">Frank: </b>Been talking about this idea of the cities being the center of revolutionary thoughts and activities - now discussion is about going back to nature, removing oneself from the capitalist flows of life. Morocco fits nicely with this - a space out of the way to work.\n\n<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-68973d5d-5fc0-7afd-0100-3fdcc57bfcff\">Nadia: </b>Doing a writeup on establishing space in Morocco. Floating the idea of preliminary discussions in Morocco, setting up plans for OpenVillage.\n\n<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-68973d5d-5fc0-7afd-0100-3fdcc57bfcff\">Kate: </b>Going back to games - wonderful trojan horse - using games to bring people into the fold, in a bold way - frame the event as a game/invitation that would allow you to use everything you\u2019ve been involved and work you\u2019ve done, finding a way to bolster the communication/invitation with some game concept that has an appeal to people that would make them travel across the world.\n\n<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-68973d5d-5fc0-7afd-0100-3fdcc57bfcff\">Gehan: </b>Interested to read up on the space in Morocco.\n\n<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-68973d5d-5fc0-7afd-0100-3fdcc57bfcff\">Bernard: </b>Ecoregeneration Camp in Portugal, similar.

By\u0142o nas o\u015bmioro dzieci. Mieszka\u0142am w mieszkaniu komunalnym na starym mie\u015bcie do pi\u0105tego roku \u017cycia. Gnie\u017adzili\u015bmy si\u0119 w jednym pokoju. Potem dostali\u015bmy w dzielnicy robotniczej. Tam by\u0142y cztery pokoje. Urodzi\u0142a si\u0119 tam moja ostatnia siostra \u2013 \u00f3sma z rodze\u0144stwa. W 1970 r. jeden z braci zgin\u0105\u0142 w wypadku samochodowym. Mia\u0142 wtedy 19 lat. By\u0142o bardzo ci\u0119\u017cko, biednie. Matka nie pracowa\u0142a, tylko nas wychowywa\u0142a, tata sam pracowa\u0142 - by\u0142 kierowc\u0105. W 1976 r. - mia\u0142am 11 lat, to by\u0142a niedziela, pami\u0119tam jak dzi\u015b \u2013 przyjecha\u0142 dyrektor firmy ojca po mam\u0119: musi pani ze mn\u0105 zej\u015b\u0107 do samochodu, bo m\u0105\u017c zas\u0142ab\u0142, musi pani ze mn\u0105 pojecha\u0107. Pojechali\u015bmy pod taki barek i ojciec ju\u017c tam le\u017ca\u0142 przykryty prze\u015bcierad\u0142em. Pami\u0119tam ten pisk, jak mama p\u0142aka\u0142a, tak ci\u0105gn\u0119\u0142a mnie za r\u0119k\u0119\u2026 Tata mia\u0142 46 lat. Matka sama zosta\u0142a z nami.\n\nChodzi\u0142am do podstaw\u00f3wki w naszej dzielnicy. P\u00f3\u017aniej posz\u0142am do krawieckiej zawod\u00f3wki. Potem pozna\u0142am swojego m\u0119\u017ca jak mia\u0142am 16-17 lat. On by\u0142 jedynakiem. Nas by\u0142o tak du\u017co i jemu to si\u0119 podoba\u0142o, \u017ce nas jest tyle, a on by\u0142 sam. Zakocha\u0142am si\u0119. Wysz\u0142am za m\u0105\u017c jak by\u0142am ju\u017c w 8 miesi\u0105cu ci\u0105\u017cy. Zaraz po urodzeniu dziecka okaza\u0142o si\u0119, \u017ce nie jest tak fajnie, bo zacz\u0105\u0142 mnie strasznie bi\u0107. C\u00f3rka mia\u0142a tak 4 lata. Le\u017ca\u0142am w szpitalu jeden, drugi raz i popad\u0142am w depresj\u0119, w chorob\u0119 psychiczn\u0105. Wszystkim si\u0119 denerwowa\u0142am, ucieka\u0142am z domu, sz\u0142am w swoj\u0105 stron\u0119, ale jako\u015b tak pcha\u0142am to wszystko. Wstydzi\u0142am si\u0119 ludzi, \u017ceby nikt si\u0119 nie dowiedzia\u0142, \u017ce taka sytuacja jest. Potem za takie ci\u0119\u017ckie pobicie poszed\u0142 do wi\u0119zienia. Siedzia\u0142 ze 2,5 roku, a potem dosta\u0142 w zawieszeniu. Wyszed\u0142 i by\u0142o jeszcze gorzej, bo przeze mnie siedzia\u0142 to trzeba by\u0142o mnie inaczej potraktowa\u0107. By\u0142 taki prze\u0142om, \u017ce jak dosta\u0142 prac\u0119, przesta\u0142 pi\u0107, powiedzia\u0142, \u017ce b\u0119dzie si\u0119 leczy\u0142, \u017ce wszystko b\u0119dzie dobrze. Urodzi\u0142am syna\u2026 a mia\u0142am ucieczk\u0119 jeszcze do mamy. Jak syn mia\u0142 10 miesi\u0119cy, mama zmar\u0142a. Wcze\u015bniej obci\u0119li jej nog\u0119, bo mia\u0142a stop\u0119 cukrzywcow\u0105. By\u0142a na w\u00f3zku inwalidzkim. Najm\u0142odsza siostra z ni\u0105 mieszka\u0142a i si\u0119 ni\u0105 opiekowa\u0142a. My te\u017c przychodzili\u015bmy, jak mogli\u015bmy. Ja by\u0142am ci\u0105gle pobita i tak jako\u015b\u2026 Wychowa\u0142am syna. By\u0142o r\u00f3\u017cnie ze wsp\u00f3lnym mieszkaniem z m\u0119\u017cem. Jak zrobi\u0142 rozr\u00f3b\u0119, pobi\u0142 mnie, to do swojej matki szed\u0142. Stara\u0142am si\u0119 wychowa\u0107 dzieci tam gdzie mieszka\u0142am. Chodzi\u0142y do szko\u0142y. C\u00f3rka sko\u0144czy\u0142a technikum maszyn i urz\u0105dze\u0144 przemys\u0142u spo\u017cywczego. Syn sko\u0144czy\u0142 technikum ochrony \u015brodowiska. Chcia\u0142am ich wychowa\u0107 jak najlepiej. C\u00f3rka zasz\u0142a w ci\u0105\u017c\u0119 jak by\u0142a jeszcze pann\u0105. Jej narzeczony by\u0142 uzale\u017cniony od narkotyk\u00f3w. Nie wysz\u0142a za niego za m\u0105\u017c. Sama wychowa\u0142a dziecko, kt\u00f3re ma teraz 16 lat. Po 9 latach pozna\u0142a innego faceta. Mia\u0142 by\u0107 taki dobry\u2026 On sam po rozwodzie. Odradza\u0142am jej to: \u017ce jak po rozwodzie, to nie jest dobry, ale wysz\u0142a za niego za m\u0105\u017c. Urodzi\u0142a c\u00f3reczk\u0119. Okaza\u0142o si\u0119, \u017ce to alkoholik, z padaczk\u0105 alkoholow\u0105. Uciek\u0142a chyba od tego ojca alkoholika w jeszcze wi\u0119kszy alkoholizm. Nie mia\u0142a gdzie si\u0119 podzia\u0107 z dzie\u0107mi, przyj\u0119\u0142am j\u0105 z powrotem do domu. W tym czasie zmar\u0142 m\u0119\u017ca ojciec. Zostawi\u0142 nam par\u0119 groszy. I \u017ceby nie przepi\u0142, kupili\u015bmy dzia\u0142k\u0119 na wsi. Tam jest taki malutki domek kryty azbestem, a obok drugi dom w budowie, niesko\u0144czony. Mia\u0142am te\u017c ksi\u0105\u017ceczk\u0119 mieszkaniow\u0105 po \u015bmierci taty. Potem ona by\u0142a guzik warta. Mia\u0142a by\u0107 na dwa pokoiki, a dosta\u0142am z niej 25 tys. z\u0142. Nic za to nie mo\u017cna by\u0142o kupi\u0107. Nawet pokoiku. M\u00f3wi\u0119 do m\u0119\u017ca, \u017ce mamy pieni\u0105dze po te\u015bciu i my mamy 50 tys. z\u0142 swoich. Trafi\u0142a si\u0119 taka kobieta, kt\u00f3ra da\u0142a nam dzia\u0142k\u0119 z tym domem na wsi na raty. Wp\u0142acili\u015bmy jej 50 tys. z\u0142 i potem co trzy miesi\u0105ce - po 4 tys. z\u0142. Razem to kosztowa\u0142o 100 tys. z\u0142. Wzi\u0119\u0142am jeszcze 12 tys. z\u0142 po\u017cyczki.\n\nC\u00f3rka ma pieni\u0105dze tylko z 500 plus, rodzinne, i chodzi klatki sprz\u0105ta. Chodzi na prace sezonowe, \u017ceby dorobi\u0107. Nie sta\u0107 mnie, \u017ceby codziennie do niej doje\u017cd\u017ca\u0107, bo 6.50 z\u0142 kosztuje bilet w jedn\u0105 stron\u0119, bo zarabiam 1 500 z\u0142 na r\u0119k\u0119 \u2013 najni\u017csz\u0105 krajow\u0105. Sama teraz mieszkam z synem. Wcze\u015bniej byli jego te\u015bciowie, wi\u0119c nie mogli\u015bmy tam zamieszka\u0107. Teraz zmar\u0142 m\u00f3j m\u0105\u017c. Mia\u0142 tyle chor\u00f3b i tych poalkoholowych. W tym samym roku zmar\u0142 m\u00f3j brat i siostra. Jedna z moich si\u00f3str mia\u0142a schizoreni\u0119. Nie mia\u0142am nigdy znik\u0105d pomocy, a tak du\u017co przesz\u0142am. M\u0105\u017c mnie podpali\u0142 i wypchn\u0105\u0142 z pierwszego pi\u0119tra. Tak to by\u0142o. Dlatego poszed\u0142 siedzie\u0107. Wcze\u015bniej nie chodzi\u0142am na policj\u0119 jak by\u0142am pobita czy skopana. Trzy razy chcia\u0142am pope\u0142ni\u0107 samob\u00f3jstwo. Po tym du\u017cym pobiciu lekarze wezwali policj\u0119. I tak zacz\u0119\u0142o si\u0119 leczenie psychiatryczne. Trafi\u0142am na w porz\u0105dku lekark\u0119 i do tej pory mnie prowadzi, pilnuje.\n\nGorzej z innymi lekarzami. Mam tarczyc\u0119 chor\u0105. Zapisa\u0142am si\u0119 w sierpniu tamtego roku na badanie szczeg\u00f3\u0142owie i dopiero w lutym 2020 roku mog\u0119 pyta\u0107 o termin. Mam te\u017c nadci\u015bnienie. Posz\u0142am si\u0119 zapisa\u0107 ze skierowaniem. W styczniu dopiero przysz\u0142ego roku mog\u0119 si\u0119 leczy\u0107. Jak tu si\u0119 leczy\u0107? Posz\u0142am, wyprosi\u0142am w innym szpitalu, jakby si\u0119 miejsce zwolni\u0142o. Zapisa\u0142am si\u0119 na listopad tego roku i czekam tak od kwietnia. Na kr\u0119gos\u0142up si\u0119 lecz\u0119 u tej samej lekarki stale. Tu bez problemu. Jak przyjd\u0119 to zawsze mnie przyjmie. Musz\u0119 mie\u0107 zastrzyki, bo nie mog\u0119 chodzi\u0107 przez rw\u0119 kulszow\u0105. To jest b\u00f3l nie do zniesienia. Czasem nawet z \u0142\u00f3\u017cka nie mog\u0119 wsta\u0107.\n\nZa m\u0142odych lat pracowa\u0142am w sklepie ok. 6 lat. Potem sprz\u0105ta\u0142am biura, laboratoria mo\u017ce 8-9 lat. Teraz - od 7 lat \u2013 myj\u0119 na zmywaku garnki w szpitalu. Wszystko to by\u0142y umowy o prac\u0119. Raz przez 2 lata na sprz\u0105tnie mia\u0142am umow\u0119 zlecenie, a potem zobaczyli, \u017ce dobrze pracuj\u0119 i dali mi umow\u0119. Staram si\u0119 uczciwie pracowa\u0107. Zawsze pracowa\u0142am za najni\u017csz\u0105 krajow\u0105 i na etat. Teraz \u2013 od kiedy m\u0105\u017c umar\u0142 - nie boj\u0119 si\u0119 jak kiedy\u015b. Nie ogl\u0105dam si\u0119 za siebie czy mnie kto\u015b uderzy. Szkoda mi, bo to \u017cycie takie zmarnowane\u2026 A m\u0142oda jestem, bo mam dopiero 54 lata. Tych chor\u00f3b si\u0119 tyle przypl\u0105ta\u0142o.\n\nNigdy nie korzysta\u0142am z pomocy spo\u0142ecznej, bo si\u0119 wsydzi\u0142am po prostu. Nieraz mi brakowa\u0142o, to wola\u0142am po\u017cyczy\u0107 czy sprz\u0105tn\u0119\u0142am komu\u015b. Tutaj ten alkohol\u2026 M\u0105\u017c pi\u0142. Jakby mi dzieci zabrali, to bym nie prze\u017cy\u0142a. O to si\u0119 ba\u0142am. Moja mama te\u017c nigdy nie korzysta\u0142a, a tyle nas wychowa\u0142a. Widzia\u0142am, \u017ce innym pomagali, ale czy im starcza\u0142o? Chyba nie, bo zawsze im by\u0142o brak na drugi dzie\u0144. To nie by\u0142y jakie\u015b wielkie pieni\u0105dze. Wola\u0142am p\u00f3j\u015b\u0107 do pracy ni\u017c do instytucji prosi\u0107 o pomoc.\n\nJak by\u0142am w ci\u0105\u017cy z pierwszym dzieckiem, chodzi\u0142am pomaga\u0107 ksi\u0119\u017com. Budowali w latach 80 - tych ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142. Jako m\u0142ode dziewczyny lata\u0142y\u015bmy pomaga\u0107: gruz nosi\u0107, sprz\u0105ta\u0107 itd. Ci ksi\u0119\u017ca je\u017adzili do w\u0142a\u015bciciela, u kt\u00f3rego p\u00f3\u017aniej mieszka\u0142am. Szyli u niego sutanny. Ksi\u0105dz wiedzia\u0142, jak\u0105 mam sytuacj\u0119 i powiedzia\u0142 mi, \u017ce mieszkanie jest wolne; \u017ce za pomoc gospodarzowi mog\u0119 tam mieszka\u0107. Dzi\u0119ki tym ksi\u0119\u017com mieli\u015bmy to mieszkanie. Byli dla nas dobrzy. W tamtych czasach ksi\u0119\u017ca rodzinom w takiej sytuacji bardziej pomagali. Ten ksi\u0105dz am\u00f3wi\u0142 nas na \u015blub i udzieli\u0142 nam go. Dostawa\u0142am od niego ubrania i pieluchy dla dziecka. W tamtych latach nie by\u0142o takich rzeczy nawet w sklepach. Ksi\u0105dz dostawa\u0142 z dar\u00f3w i mi oddawa\u0142. Teraz to chyba mniej pomagaj\u0105, bo tyle z\u0142ych rzeczy si\u0119 s\u0142yszy\u2026 O tych molestowaniach dzieci\u2026 To jest tego du\u017co. Wtedy ksi\u0119\u017ca byli uczciwsi i lepsi. Jestem osob\u0105 bardzo wierz\u0105c\u0105. Za ka\u017cdym razem modl\u0119 si\u0119. Mam tyle obrazk\u00f3w i do ka\u017cdego si\u0119 modl\u0119 o lepszy dzie\u0144: do \u015aw. Marty, do \u015aw. Rity. Chodz\u0119 do ko\u015bcio\u0142a. Co dzie\u0144 wst\u0119puj\u0119 do kaplicy w szpitalu. Modl\u0119 si\u0119 do Boga, \u017ceby mi da\u0142 zdrowie i \u017cebym mia\u0142a si\u0142\u0119 przepracowa\u0107 ka\u017cdy kolejny dzien. Prosz\u0119 o wstawiennictwo w trudnych sprawach. M\u00f3wi\u0119 pacie\u017c co wiecz\u00f3r. Robi\u0119 to dla siebie. Zawsze prosz\u0119 o zdrowie dla dzieci, \u017ceby mia\u0142y si\u0142\u0119.\n\nTo takie dziwne zako\u0144czenie dla mnie. Bardzo prze\u017cy\u0142am \u015bmier\u0107 m\u0119\u017ca. Zawsze prze\u017cywam \u015bmier\u0107 - czy to cz\u0142owiek czy zwierz\u0119. Nigdy nikogo nie skrzywdzi\u0142am.Pr\u00f3bowa\u0142am si\u0119 rozwie\u015b\u0107 dwa razy. Za ka\u017cdym razem s\u0119dzia m\u00f3wi\u0142a, \u017ceby da\u0107 m\u0119\u017cowi szans\u0119 i za ka\u017cdym razem on obiecywa\u0142 popraw\u0119. M\u00f3wi\u0142 w s\u0105dzie, \u017ce ja sobie to zmieniam i wszystko inaczej m\u00f3wi\u0119 jak by\u0142o, bo jestem chora. M\u00f3wi\u0142, \u017ce wypije czasami, ale jest dobry. Ja tak przebacza\u0142am i nigdy nie dosz\u0142o do rozwodu. On jak nie pi\u0142, to by\u0142 ze mn\u0105, ale jak pi\u0142 to prosi\u0142am jego rodzic\u00f3w i oni go zabierali. Wtedy nie by\u0142o go 3-4 miesi\u0105ce. Dzieci wychowa\u0142am, do szko\u0142y trzeba by\u0142o je wys\u0142a\u0107. Na dobre m\u0105\u017c wyni\u00f3s\u0142 si\u0119 do innego miasta tak z 8 lat temu. Tam mia\u0142 prac\u0119. Nie raz mi pieni\u0105dze da\u0142 jak mia\u0142, jak potrzebowa\u0142am. Mia\u0142am alimenty na c\u00f3rk\u0119. Nie pami\u0119tam ile to by\u0142o, ale to jakie\u015b grosze. Przy drugiej pr\u00f3bie rozwodu zgodzi\u0142am si\u0119, \u017ceby nie p\u0142aci\u0142 na pierwsze dziecko, bo obiecywa\u0142, \u017ce wszystko b\u0119dzie dobrze. Sam siebie tak oszukiwa\u0142. Potem m\u00f3wi\u0142, \u017ce to nie jego syn.\n\nJestem teraz po operacji ginekologicznej. By\u0142am 3 miesi\u0105ce na zwolnieniu. Te\u017c mi nikt nie pom\u00f3g\u0142. Mam oparcie w synu, a z c\u00f3rk\u0105 mam ma\u0142o kontaktu. Nie sta\u0107 mnie na je\u017cdzenie. Mam tyle k\u0142opot\u00f3w po zwolnieniu. Wr\u00f3ci\u0142am niedawno do pracy. Z wnukami mam kontakt. Przyje\u017cdzaj\u0105 czasem do mnie. Syn ma 3 \u2013 letnie dziecko i nie mog\u0119 z nim wyj\u015b\u0107, biega\u0107 za nim czy wzi\u0105\u0107 na r\u0119ce, bo nie mam si\u0142y.\n\nMiesi\u0119cznie moje koszty \u017cycia s\u0105 wysokie.

We might call it the _temporary spaces era_. In that period, it has been fairly easy for several people and groups, many of them artists, to get physical spaces for free. There was, however, a catch; freedom came with precarity. Arrangement around these spaces gives landlords the freedom to re-allocate them to newer, more profitable uses at a moment's notice. A layer of intermediaries emerged, severing any direct contact between landlords and the communities using the space. Communities are now tired, and have realized it does not make sense to invest on a space if you are not sure you can use it long enough to recoup your investment.\n\nThere seems to be no clear way forward. And the terrain is populated by enigmatic actors, whose role is, to an outsider like me, unclear. What does the [Bouwmeester](http://bma.brussels/en/homepage/), or City Master Architect, do, for example? And how exactly did the venerable holding company [Sofina](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofina) partner up with a local politician to launch [DigitYser](https://digityser.org)? Who are the intermediaries, and what can you trust them to do?\n\nAs I listened to the discussion in the room, I could not help thinking that a strategic map of Brussels would be very valuable for anyone who wants to build their own space, like, er, [our own space, The Reef](/t/6239) (more on that in future posts). The room had a lot of knowledge, but it is not structured, it is mostly based on having been around for a long time, and talking to people. @yannick, Pauline, Adrian, Koen and others can act on that knowledge. Me? No, I miss the context. Even though I have lived in Brussels for seven years, I felt very much the outsider.\n\nIt would be great if these conversations resulted in some kind of instructable that an outsider could, potentially, follow to successfully starting a space. An Edgeryders Space Program of sorts, where the #culture-squad could contribute by deploying its considerable skill at documentation and organization of knowledge.  \n\nAm I making sense?", "created_at": "2019-05-02 14:24:37.792501", "updated_at": "2019-05-02 14:24:37.792501", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 383, "wiki": false, "reads": 25, "score": 120.0, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 4096, 3, 2536, 4795, 1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 47690, "user_id": 4635, "topic_id": 9071, "post_number": 6, "raw": "hey all! \n\nI love the vision that is being presented here and the attempt to unite people in their efforts at all scales and to bring the best from all of these tools that are being practiced with different intensity in different communities. \n\nThe balancing act of things like single-sign-on and carrying the social graph with the posibility to evolve systems and be adaptive to the needs of the present resonate very much with the work I have been doing and I would love to present how I think that the tech I have been involving myself with over the past year solves a lot of pains and creates massive amounts of opportunites.\n\nI've been following and participating in the development of the open source pattern and infrastructure Holochain, I've described it briefly in a response to an inquiry [here on edgeryders](https://edgeryders.eu/t/putting-edgeryders-on-blockchain-of-course/8460/13) but I'd like to point out here that this tech gives us the ability of maintaining data integrity and maintain the flexibility of designing for a specific local need, while being able to pull in modules generated in the global community whenever useful. This is done by bridging all systems on the level of the agent.\n\nApps talk to each other through you. Through you as a user, you can bring your identities and graph from one space to another and you don't need to handle authentication at different spaces. You can also create the distributed data storage only loosly coupled to the front end interfaces that you want to use, this code is created with a main purpose of interoperability. I can tout it's horn for some time but I'll leave for you to check out the websites [starting here](https://holochain.org/) perhaps.\n\nAs for maturity of the codebase, it's pretty early days but I have been building prototypes on it to try it out. There is a go version that is no longer being actively developed as a major rewrite into Rust of the whole structure is currently being finished. Stable beta is expected to be Q1 next year. It's pretty weird tech to work with if one is coming from a background of designing from a data-centric worldview but really powerful when you get into thinking of actor-centric programming. Basically you install ways of speaking and enter that data locally in a chain, then you choose to share what you have said into different shared spaces in order for others to validate and interact with it.\n\nWould love to talk about it more, but am super unavailable for about a week and a half, so if I respond sparingly, bare with me ;)", "created_at": "2018-09-28 21:59:07.390492", "updated_at": "2018-09-28 21:59:07.390492", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 462, "wiki": false, "reads": 31, "score": 81.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4022, 3067], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2332, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2299, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<em>(Intended for [Matthias])</em>\n\nThis contract is a sort of Mission:Baltic times four. We seed and animate online conversation \u2013 aimed at some sort of foresight exercise \u2013 in four countries. We also have a global layer where we bring these conversations together for perspective. Countries might be something like: Georgia, Bangladesh, South Africa, Ukraine \u2013 at any rate, no Western European country where everybody speaks English. The time frame is also brutal: finish the work by end of March.\n\nSo we have opposite constraints. On the one hand, the need for interoperable conversation, compounded by the time issue. These press for a tech solution of hosting everything on the existing ER platform and using English as the connecting language. On the other hand, we have countries in which English literacy might be low, and languages are a big political deal with the UN.\n\nThe solution might be the original ER1: some briefing and explanatory material translated in several languages. Conversation in English. Google Translate integration allowing anyone not comfortable with English to write in whatever language. I ran this through Millie and it seems an acceptable compromise. This is also good for us, as we might be able to pull into the core ER community some of the participants to this exercise\n\n.\n\nCan you, Matt, think of an implementation that fits into our information architecture? There are choices to make that could be very important. For example, is the whole exercise one group on Edgeryders? Is each country a separate group? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each solution? These are never just (or even mainly) technical choices, but it is important to get a feel for tech constraints. Also, I would like to get an idea of the experience of the Internet in those countries.

It's called\u00a0<a href=\"http://hackingutopia.cre8tives.org/about/\">Hacking Utopia- \\#OpenCare for social and demographic change</a>\u00a0and was born out of our shared experiences as designers.\n\nMore specifically the frustration with outdated design education that ill prepares students to be able to do meaningful work with their skills and talents. We feel that this should start already during their education so by the time they have graduated they are already up and running their own exciting projects that really contribute towards tackling some of the bigger challenges which affect us all. \u00a0After a lot of work over the past couple of months, especially by Susa, the partnership agreement between Edgeryders and UDK was finalised and last week we launched the first ever edition of this course with a four-day intense workshop.\n\nOver the next six months each student will be working on design research and product development process that departs from the OpenCare topic and methodologies. They will be doing it in synch with the phases of the larger <a href=\"/en/opencare-research\">OpenCare research project</a>. The course participants' documentation and individual reflections from each day are uploaded in the <a href=\"/en/op3ncare/helping-one-another-to-discover-what-is\">Op3nCare Community Homebase</a> where you are very welcome to leave comments helping them develop their thinking and projects. Or better yet: follow the course and take on the tasks yourself! it's a fun way to unleash some of your creative urges while maybe picking up some new skills...and contributing to the common good :) You may even be eligible for the <a href=\"/en/op3ncare/the-op3ncare-fellowship-program\">new fellowship program </a>we are building!\n\nWhy do this? You get to see the OpenCare topic and challenges from many different perspectives and help shape the students research and product development work so they really are contributing to the Opencare research project. For the students getting feedback from you is an unparalleled way to discover new\u00a0knowledge and broaden their horizons about what is happening in the fields relevant to all our work.\n\nThe results of the students work will be exhibited in Berlin at Designtransfer UDK and it looks like some of them might run crowdfunding campaigns on StartNext.\n\n<strong>Opening:</strong> Wednesday, 20 July, 19.00\n\n<strong>Exhibition:</strong> 21 July\u2013 24 July, 10.00\u201318.00\u00a0\n\n<strong>Address:</strong>\u00a0D<font color=\"#333333\" face=\"'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\">esigntransfer UdK, \u00a0</font>Einsteinufer 43-53, 10587 Berlin\n\nConcept: GastProf. Susanne Stauch/ID2 &amp; Nadia EL-Imam/Edgeryders\n\nTeam: GastProf Dr. Martin Kiel/GWK, Prof. Jozef Legrand, KM Sarah-Lena Walf, KM Johanna Dehio, Valentina Karga, Svenja Bickert-Appleby, Ludwig Kannicht, Laura Stra\u00dfer, Bj\u00f6rn Weigelt\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\">\u00a0</h2>\n\nDate: 2016-07-20 19:00:00 - 2016-07-24 18:00:00, Europe/Brussels Time.", "created_at": "2016-04-15 10:00:58", "updated_at": "2017-10-04 16:26:03.068162", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 588, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 31.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 39091, "user_id": 347, "topic_id": 7430, "post_number": 28, "raw": "Thank you @zmorda, i'm free in that period so I would love to participate, I can also help on the prototype process, (if, for example we want to use a [Business Model Canvass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas) workshop style).\n30 minutes for the pitching lesson it's a very very short time (I saw that schedule in the program), 45 minute is the minimum to pass all the content without exercises.\n\nBut maybe we can talk about that later in the process.\n\n80% I would fly to Beirut right after the camp, so from my side it's enough to have the one way Italy-Tunisia cost covered (btw it's better to fly over Djerba or Tunis?)", "created_at": "2017-11-06 17:09:05.304056", "updated_at": "2017-11-06 17:11:02.584399", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 121, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 9.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [38872], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 84732, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 14556, "post_number": 3, "raw": "https://edgeryders.eu/t/ngi-ethnography-preliminary-findings-october-2020/14542/11", "created_at": "2020-10-12 07:18:20.953305", "updated_at": "2020-10-12 07:18:20.953305", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 12, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 2.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [84690], "is_reply_to": [84728], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 68862, "user_id": 6085, "topic_id": 12425, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Dear project leaders,\n\nThank you for taking the time to prepare and submit the offline tasks. \n\nHere\u2019s the feedback delivered to those who submitted their work within the deadlines:\n\n[ **@MohsenMahdaoui** ](https://edgeryders.eu/u/mohsenmahdaoui) ,Tunisia,PaillEco\n\n*Dear Mohsen,*\n\n*Thank you for submitting your Lab3 Offline tasks.*\n\n*Overall you have done a good job however there are some areas for improvement especially with regard to the lean canvas since the validation board uses the information from the LC:*\n\n*In the customer segment (CS), you mentioned 2 types of customers : individuals and businesses (restaurants, caf\u00e9s, hotels, etc.), I believe that they have different needs and problem and you should prepare a LC for each CS*\n\n*The problem: As I said above, the problem could be different for each CS.

Edit and expand as needed.</em>\n\nThe OpenCare engagement strategy is grounded in the Grant Agreement, specifically WP1. It\u00a0requires inputs from all other WPs except WP6. The main idea is that we do not do communication as a standalone activity, we \"frame\u00a0communication and dissemination as a structural part of research rather than an add-on\". So, we engage people by involving them onto addressing the research questions (in the lab or through discussion); we make sure that the result of those activities is always documented online; and we re-share that documentation to create even more engagement.\u00a0\n\nThe activities involved are the following:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>Onboarding structure</strong> (task 1.2,\u00a0milestone M1, end of March). This in turn consists of three items: the <strong>structure by <a href=\"/op3ncare/helping-one-another-to-discover-what-is\">challenges</a></strong> we decided to give to the online conversation [EDGE];\u00a0the <strong><a href=\"/en/op3ncare/the-op3ncare-fellowship-program\">Fellowship program</a></strong>\u00a0[EDGE];\u00a0and the <strong>offline onboarding workshops</strong> (like those already held in Brussels, London and Milano [WEMAKE, SF, MILANO, EDGE]).

I am myself a user of Scuttlebutt (SSB), and would like to qualify your proposition that \n\n[quote=\"zelf, post:1, topic:9802\"]\nWhat\u2019s specifically interesting is when you take mesh networks in combination with peer-to-peer protocols, [...] they happen to fit very well together as the two technologies merge and creating something quite unique.\n[/quote]\n\nScuttlebutt's [presentation video](https://vimeo.com/236358264) states:\n\n> When Scuttlebutt is running, it looks to see if there are any other Scuttlebutt accounts on the local network, that is to say, the coffee shop wi-fi.\n\nIn the video, the two cute characters Jackie and Martin are indeed using SSB from the same coffee shop. She follows him, he is well connected, and all is clear skies and smooth sailing from there. Indeed, they do not need \"the Internet\" to share stuff with each other, because they sit on the same local network. Neither do they need servers, because the content lives in folders on their laptops. So, *technologically*, the features you identify in your post ensue.\n\nBut what happens *socially*? Not much, it turns out. Maybe New Zealand is different that way, but If I go to a Brussels Caf\u00e9 the chances of someone else running SSB from the same caf\u00e9 are close to zero. So, nothing is enabled for me. To use SSB, i need to use the hack of [pubs](https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/faq/basics/pub):\n\n> pubs are servers that have a static IP address, are always online, and always follow you back when you follow them (thus growing their network). In this way, they can act as a waypoint for you to find the location of your friends and catch up with them. When you first get started on Scuttlebutt it can appear incredibly empty until you \"join\" a pub.\n\nIn other words, I could not use SSB without \"the Internet\" (or moving to a hipsterish area of New Zealand, perhaps). \n\nNone of this invalidates what you have to say. All I'm saying is this: let's all be very wary of technological determinism. Just because the tech enables something, it does not mean this something will happen. I am curious: do you have any experience of SSB working locally, as in your areas 1 and 2? Where? Do you have any observation to report as to what people use it for? \n\nKeep up the good work. \n\nPasting the link to the SSB presentation video for the many folks who do not use it.\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/236358264", "created_at": "2019-04-30 13:05:27.926619", "updated_at": "2019-04-30 13:05:27.926619", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 431, "wiki": false, "reads": 32, "score": 31.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [52837], "is_reply_to": [52837], "is_liked_by": [5083], "is_private": false}, {"id": 84955, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 14556, "post_number": 6, "raw": "@Jan, @Wojt, I just had a great call with Mania G\u00f3ralska, a Polish digital anthropologist working on Poland and a former colleague of mine at Oxford.

For me it's a small mystery, because the list is opt-in: everybody who is on it has\u00a0<em>asked\u00a0</em>to. So, why would you ask to be on a list aimed at resharing links and then never reshare any link?\u00a0\n\nThe question is interesting, but we have a second-order problem: if the \\#countonme people don't react to the mails, why would they react to our invitation to open a discussion here?\u00a0\n\nI suggest a hack. It comes down to crafting a careful email to tell people what is going on, and asking for their input. Specific care should be taken in crafting the subject line, trying to (respectfully) catch the recipient's attention. For example:\n\n<strong>\"Countonme\"... can we really count on you?</strong>\n\nMaybe we could even personalize them: it's only forty people, so we could send 13 emails to three addresses each, and start them with names \"Dear Alice, Bob and Carla...\". The mail would contain mainly a call to action: participate in the discussion in this very thread and participate in the Twitterstorm. I am not sure about this final point, maybe you cannot really have two calls to action in only one email. I very much trust <a href=\"/u/noemi\">@Noemi</a>'s community manager instincts.\n\nAnd now for my two cents: I suggest that low-engagement could be best served by snappier tweets. I am one of the few people on \\#Countonme to actually share: but I found out I have to rewrite practically every tweet in my own style. I also settled in a pattern in which I generally share only one of the three daily links.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-09-12 13:15:05", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:28.626359", "deleted_at": null,

we have been away from the nature, as we became obsessed with using plastic bags in our daily life( for example.)\nThe idea came from the need to get back to nature in everything. The project then was divided to several phases; Phase 1, named Eco-Travel Egypt,  started in April 2015. This was part of the whole project aiming to revive the connection between people and nature.\n This was done by traveling to natural places and Environmentally protected areas in Egypt, getting to know the wild life and resources there, connecting this with our human impact on this ecosystem and  discussing problems like traveling plastic waste to the ocean and the effect on the marine life, then helping in cleaning the natural environment in these places from plastics.\n This phase succeeded, way more our expectations, and we found out that there is need for such trips and events, you can see what happened with pictures in our facebook page :  wwww.facebook.com/ecotravelegypt\nwww.ecotravelegypt.net\nAfter a year from the successful phase one, we started to move to a new mission regarding the seas, we started a new brand called \u201cEco-dive Egypt\u201d aiming to optimal utilization of sea resources while diving, this is currently still underdevelopment ( implementation, observation, and evaluation ) there are still other phases to come, we are working on a track for children and another for natural crafts, I hope this could be implemented soon. \nThanks for your efforts and I am ready to answer any question. \nAbdelrahman Nassar\nEco-Egypt founder", "created_at": "2017-08-10 15:16:47.959998", "updated_at": "2017-09-05 19:48:50.198133", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 627, "wiki": false, "reads": 24, "score": 344.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 51403, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 9511, "post_number": 11, "raw": "Will have my part done by end of week.\n\n@markomanka can you take a stab at replying to reviewer 4\u2019s comment?

This network would allow persons with disabilities the possibility to request for an assistance by posting the details of the activity that they want to do, and get propositions of the Personal Care Assistants through the platform, and then they will choose the best proposal according to criteria that they identify.\n\nAuxiLife will reduce time and energy consumption to look for the \u201cPersonal Care Assistant\u201d to be with the person with disabilities.\n\nThis was the humble story of Aymen Masmoudi, a mobile developper and a young social entrepreneur from Tunisia, who expect your awareness, your encouragement and your awareness.\n\nHere you find also some pictures and videos\n\n15/07/2016 closing ceremony of MDev (Mobile Development) with the First Minister Mr Habib Essid\n\n<img src='/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a82786d57b577f8ef685645539789df9609cf9e9.jpg' width=\"660\" height=\"437\">", "created_at": "2017-08-21 20:54:55.443250", "updated_at": "2017-11-13 17:52:55.547181", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 418, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 173.0, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 1935, 3838, 3729], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60678, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 10326, "post_number": 24, "raw": "[quote=\"J_Noga, post:23, topic:10326\"]\nhorizontal AI legislation (principles) in early 2020.

Introducing \\#openandchange.**\n\n<a href=\"https://edgeryders.eu\">Edgeryders</a> is a global community dedicated to enabling full participation in our communities and planet. Its mission is to bring together activists and radical thinkers from every corner of the globe to find new and pioneering ways to contribute to the common good. The <a href=\"https://www.macfound.org/press/press-releases/new-macarthur-competition-award-100-million-help-solve-critical-social-problem/\">MacArthur Foundation has launched 100&amp;Change</a>, a competition that will award a $100 million grant to a single proposal designed to help solve a critical problem affecting people, places, or the planet.\n\n<strong>One of the most critical problems we currently face is that of how to provide health and social care to all.</strong> Edgeryders believes that the solution is to take a leaf out of nature\u2019s book and embrace the power of diversity. Their radical approach to the MacArthur Foundation challenge is to hack funding by coordinating a thriving ecosystem of hundreds of communities and organizations.\n\n<strong>They pledge to attack the problem just as nature does: through collaboration, competition, and most essentially, local adaptation.</strong> Rather than attempt to force a one size fits all answer to a multifaceted question, their solution will be a patchwork of coordinated, locally optimised solutions. This innovative strategy is designed to radically de-centralise funding and cut through bureaucratic cookie-cutter solutions that don\u2019t work.\n\n<strong>The smart swarm is open to applications now.</strong> If you agree that sustainable, humane, affordable health and social care is vital, if you think you can contribute a piece of the solution no matter how small: <a href=\"http://openandchange.care\">join us</a> at <a href=\"http://openandchange.care\">http://openandchange.care</a>\n\nOn September 20th the Edgeryders network are hosting an online press conference introducing the collective effort and presenting concrete initiatives of community led care, as well as how they come together in a single ambitious effort. <strong>TUNE IN on SEP 20th at 17:00 CET and follow \\#OPENandChange on twitter or facebook</strong> for a different kind of press conference.

If not, are you planning to keep this kind of features out of the main platform or not planning to rely on them, at all?\n\n----------\n\n**Semantics**\n\nThe Discourse model for forums is indeed very agile, it provides excellent content overview and fairly good navigation.\nOn the other end, being a forum, I feel it tends to \"flatten a few semantic dimensions\" when compared to a full CMS and, even more, to those with social networking capabilities.\nMy understanding, from a quick glance at current the re-organization, is that content has been remapped more or less as follows:\n\n* **sections** (or **post categories**) become **forum categories**\n* **groups** become **sub-categories**\n* **blog posts** and **group posts** become **forum topics**, being differentiated from each other via the categories they belong to\n* **static pages** become **forum topics** too, the main difference being that replies are locked\n* **wikis** (I couldn't actually find wiki pages yet) are **forum topics** as well, with [special features](https://meta.discourse.org/t/what-is-a-wiki-post/30801) (and [caveats?](https://meta.discourse.org/t/editing-wiki-posts-at-same-time-as-someone-else/30741))\n* finally, I assume Discourse's **groups** will be used to handle private access and custom notifications (but AFAIK they're only managed by administrators)\n\nIs this correct enough as an interpretation?\nIf that's the case, I assume some stantard concepts, typically existing in social networks, such as the _following_ mechanism, _dashboards_, _group summaries_ won't be available here. Same goes for _blog_ views and _multi-level menus_ (these last ones being the least missed feature, frankly).\n\nHere's a few links about related topics where doubts and limits are presented, just to give a broader idea:\n\n* https://meta.discourse.org/t/how-to-structure-my-forum/58609\n* https://meta.discourse.org/t/group-semantics/39913\n* https://meta.discourse.org/t/working-with-specific-structures/56312 (about structuring pages)\n* https://meta.discourse.org/t/improving-the-groups-page-for-1-7/53347\n* https://meta.discourse.org/t/what-is-a-wiki-post/30801\n* https://meta.discourse.org/t/adding-custom-static-pages/5497\n* https://meta.discourse.org/t/easy-to-use-static-pages-plugin/36280\n\n----------\n\nTo sum up, the nature of my question was triggered by this renovation but was, let's say, on a higher level.\nI consider you guys the heroes of hyper-active online communities and I'm simply keen to know all I can from stuff you learnt on the way. :)\n\nAgain, I don't want to sidetrack the original topic so feel free to move this elsewhere (I'd open a new topic myself but I'm still not aware of the way you'll structure categories in this new incarnation of ER).", "created_at": "2017-07-23 02:21:30.406408", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:04.402144", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 738, "wiki": false, "reads": 31, "score": 76.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [33505], "is_liked_by": [3760, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 50027, "user_id": 4828, "topic_id": 9347, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hi there, this is Mart\u00edn from Spain...

The fellowship is quite clear now but people want to know what's going to happen in morroco or tunisia and what will happen in the workshop. Questions like how long the residency is,  what kind of projects will be selected etc. The practical details.\n\nIt's interesting to note the differences in attitude among different people we meet. In Lebanon people have told us that the reactions of people around them is scepticism while others report the opposite: \n> _Till now the people I talk to....after a while of chatting talking about the open village and so , they are really interested in the idea, ( to my surprise some people in Egypt they are actually willing to relocate to tunisia or morroco )! Even if the project doesn't continue they are already in the network and have opened a new market for their work  - Hazem_\n\nThis may change after the workshops when people better understand the different components and how they/their projects can directly benefit from being involved. The benefits of investing in becoming part of a a strong, supportive community where many more tight relationships can be built with time... It may also just be a function of the people who have been contacted so far. This week we start reaching out in a more \"public\" mode to ensure that there is sufficient diversity of people and projects in the  process.\n\nOur strategy is to enable people who want to take the risk and/or have projects which have a credible chance at generating revenue. We will collaboratively design and deploy creative solutions to live well on very little little money. Edgeryders will cover the cost of rent for a few months after which the space and projects within it have to sustain themselves.\n\n* lowering cost of living \n* getting to know new interesting people to partner or collaborate with\n* opening new markets for ones initiatives\n* building an international collaborations, partnerships and active business networks\n\nThe process consists of a mix of online and face-to-face activities.\n\n* Building a roadmap for how your individual project can be translated/ grow in the OV House x, as well as how you can contribute towards this happening. For example Karim who is driving the Hydroponics Konnabat initiative has concrete ideas on how to generate revenue from a specific space of land. Others will have ideas for services that they could provide to the community in the house while making use of the OpenVillage's activities to lower their own costs of living and working. We have a number of fellowships to allocate The first fellows will be people who already are talented and very motivated to set up OpenVillage space (they should have at least been exploring building something similar in their local environment). We would tailor some of the work moving forward around supporting those efforts while generating tangible value for everyone who is not going to use that physical space (e.g. because they are based in a different country or city). What we can offer:\n\n* Business/ Project Mentorship:\n_1) **Structured process for peer-powered busines**s model design, fundraising, product development, team matching and building, administration and governance, fundraising and communications (marketing/ PR)_\n_2) **Stuctured way for how people can get feedback on their own business models** (e.g. by building health and investment readiness assesments). People can fill in a form and leave reflections on what others have submitted in order to access the assesment service from an expert. We could even do it in exchange for a working vacation in the house (free space and food, great company, lots of inspiring initiatives to learn from etc) - the nerd's alternative to cooking on a beach on your own with little intellectual or creative stimulation._\n\nThe workshop is being designed collaboratively - welcome to [join in the design discussions here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o5oiJIfBTmmtRlzP1cXmQ8uLoCSzg-JV3LXiD2F-krk/edit#)", "created_at": "2017-08-28 19:18:43.231079", "updated_at": "2017-08-28 19:19:34.882902", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 679, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 48.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 45682, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 8778, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Thank you for the link, it's a very interesting technology: mature, low-tech, DIY producable, and capable of crossing any terrain.

I&rsquo;ve been working on gender-based violence response for a little over a decade now, and have been focussing on issues of trust and gender, sexual politics, and how the role of emerging technologies in that. I want to facilitate meaningful connections between stakeholders, anticipate emergent harms, and ensure these conversations center on survivors and practitioners.\n\nMy personal trajectory into this research topic goes way back. I owe much of my gender consciousness to growing up in a bilingual and bicultural household as a Korean American immigrant. My family moved to the US from South Korea when I was 11-years-old, and it exposed me to two different systems of gender. Through that, I was able to develop my own kind of consciousness about how both gender and culture are not fixed.\n\nIn college, I became involved with the campus sexual assault/Title IX movement, organizing it on my own campus. And I spent about six months essentially doing a qualitative research by talking to different student groups to figure out what happens when a student experiences sexual assault and the extent to which the university does or doesn&rsquo;t take responsibility and provide resources for that. This coincided with a national movement which led to the [Obama administration's policy reform in 2014](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/01/22/memorandum-establishing-white-house-task-force-protect-students-sexual-a). \n\nMuch of the national organizing relied heavily on social media, specifically Facebook groups to build coalition and share best practices. This happened to coincide with growing cultural awareness of social media as a potential tool for movement and community building. The downside of that that none of us really anticipated going in was cyberharassment. It was in the early days of[ Gamergate](https://gawker.com/what-is-gamergate-and-why-an-explainer-for-non-geeks-1642909080). And that is what made me interested in the role of technology: its double-edged role in facilitating connections but also targeted harassment. Fast forward to five years, and I&rsquo;m doing a research project on the role of technology in sexual misconduct reporting.\n\nAnd that has been my path ever since, looking at the ways in which we can be imaginative in thinking about bodily autonomy, care, and intimacy; how to translate that to political solidarity; and how that can be operationalized into actionable policy to hold institutions accountable; and the role of new technologies in that process.\n\n**Lessons from anti-rape organizing and cyberharassment**\n\nWhen I started organizing against campus sexual violence, it required me to spend a lot of time online to research, draft guidelines, connect with organizers in other campuses and organizations, etc. Almost immediately, I realized there were many communities of misogynist men who would actively track the discourse on sexual violence, and then directlytarget young activists who became national figureheads. They&rsquo;d constantly barrage us, saying we were liars, or that we didn&rsquo;t know what we were talking about.\n\nIt was deeply unsettling. I distinctly remember trying to report some cyberharassment I received. It felt different from other forms of harassment I had experienced before.. I would open my phone or my laptop, and the red notification button would just glare at me. Because it was anonymous and online, it felt like I was constantly being watched. I felt completely at a loss as to how to even respond to it. I decided to report to the campus police and I remember being told it was my fault for having online accounts online, &ldquo;Oh, you wrote something online? Well, we can&rsquo;t really do anything.&rdquo;\n\nI knew that this was the common response to cyberharassment, let alone non-tech facilitated harassment. Victims are always told that they should watch out, they should be more vigilant and judicious. I knew nothing would be done so I dropped my report. I know that there are some resources available today, but they remain individualized defensive strategies. We need to listen to the victims and activists of cyberharassment and tech-facilitated abuse to fundamentally change how we conceptualize these issues. It&rsquo;s built into the design of the Internet we have today, and until we change the platforms, it&rsquo;s only gonna get worse.\n\nIt&rsquo;s been about six or seven years since we&rsquo;ve first started organizing on different campuses across the US. We formed a network that&rsquo;s now become a nonprofit organization called [Know Your IX](https://www.knowyourix.org/). It started with a handful of us and it&rsquo;s been incredible to see this network of college students grow into a leading organization of young people combatting gender-based violence. Some are lawyers now, some are academics, and some are no longer in the space. Burning out is a real deterrent in this space, unfortunately. We lose our most vocal and critical people because we don&rsquo;t have the structure in place for them to reflect and grow. And all this while battling PTSD and other mental health challenges, and as the cyberharassment keeps clogging your inbox.\n\nWe know that this kind of environment has a chilling effect on who decides to speak where. Research shows again and again that women, especially women of color, tend to self-censor. But I think the issue extends beyond cyberharassment and hate speech. Youth organizing increasingly requires public visibility. We are asking young people to put themselves out on the Internet to face a barrage of hateful speech in order to commodify themselves in the name of social justice. I know, for myself, I found the constant expectation of visibility extremely constraining and harmful. I made a conscious decision to shift to research because I find that level of scholarly distance to be a more meaningful way to converse with an audience I can challenge and trust. I realize that&rsquo;s an extremely privileged option, and I really hope that we move beyond the visibility-oriented model of organizing. It asks too much of our organizers with little or no safeguarding in place.\n\n**Can tech design for survivors?**\n\nMy doctoral research takes an ethnographically-informed approach to interrogate how assumptions about sex, violence, and power are encoded into the design and implementation of data/AI-driven sexual misconduct reporting systems.\n\nIn the case of campus sexual assault in the US, there has been an influx of digital systems designed to facilitate disclosures, collect evidence, and automate reporting. These systems are attractive to institutions, because they seem to be an easy fix to a difficult problem: having an internal grievance procedure, making sure it&rsquo;s a fair process, etc. This is especially true right now in a politically charged environment with #metoo and the Trump administration. To victims, who have very reasonable considerations to distrust their institutions \u2014 maybe because of their prior experiences of not being heard, or because they feel isolated, or because they fear retaliation \u2014 these technologies are perceived to be objective and neutral third parties.\n\nUnfortunately, there are flaws in how these systems are designed and how they&rsquo;re applied. They are designed by humans. This means biases are encoded into the design of the systems, especially about what sexual harassment or violence looks like, or what a real victim is. And when they&rsquo;re applied within a politically charged and socially laden environment, they of course have discriminatory, exclusionary and unjust implications.\n\nI&rsquo;ve conducted three years of ethnographically informed interviews with system designers, web users, and with institutional adopters \u2014 both frontend and backend users. The recurring narrative is that because this is data- and automation-driven, it is objective, it&rsquo;s neutral, it&rsquo;s secure. It very much feeds into the collective imagination of technologies as non-human and therefore, trustworthy. Interestingly, there&rsquo;s actually some behavioral science suggesting that because of this perception, victims are more likely to disclose earlier on and seek help earlier on, when they&rsquo;re talking to a digital interface rather than a human.\n\nPart of it stems from the erosion of trust in traditional institutions and law enforcement, especially when it comes to sexual violence. Especially in the #metoo era, a lot of people, especially women, especially women of color, have very legitimate reasons to doubt that their institutions have their backs. And that&rsquo;s especially a serious issue when it comes to sexual violence, because the two most important factors in a survivors decision to report are:\n\n* you need to be able to name what you experienced as a wrong. A lot of survivors don&rsquo;t, because they think their experience wasn&rsquo;t &lsquo;real&rsquo; or &lsquo;bad&rsquo; enough.\n* you need to believe that you will be believed when you do decide to disclose. Many, especially those from communities with historically charged relationship with law enforcement, don&rsquo;t.\n\nPeople harbor serious distrust in their institutions and for good reasons. Tech positions itself as the solution to this problem of institutional distrust. Big Tech has successfully presented itself as the reliable and ideal alternative to the failures of traditional institutions. Because many people harbor reasonable distrust towards traditional institutions and don&rsquo;t necessarily understand tech systems, Big Tech can be really appealing. I&rsquo;ve really struggled with this aspect, which comes up in my fieldwork over and over again. When you have been dismissed, interrogated, and vilified by traditional institutions of law enforcement all your life, why would you want to turn to them in your moment of need? Without alleviating these institutions from their history of inequality and injustice, what does meaningfully distinguish them from Big Tech is that they are, by design, accountable to public interest. The same can&rsquo;t be said for Big Tech.\n\nSo, then, how do these systems fail to work? Consider how these reporting tools categorize sexual violence. In general, the reporting interface will ask few descriptive questions about who, when, where and an open response form asking &lsquo;describe what happened.&rsquo; Around this point, forms generally provide the option for the user to select a category of sexual misconduct that applies to them. It may appear as a drop-down menu or checkboxes. Some may enable you to select more than one option, say, &lsquo;racial profiling&rsquo; and &lsquo;sexual harassment.&rsquo; Some may only allow for one category. Some may not even have a category that applies to you. This is often the case with experiences of non-physical/sexual violence, like stalking and partner abuse. This means that, if your experience of sexual harassment is different from system designer&rsquo;s understanding of sexual harassment, you may not even be able to input your experience. This bias actively leaves out certain people&rsquo;s experiences, because its designers are working with a very particular narrative of how they understand what violence is.\n\nSo, then, what actually could be a useful use of tech? There have been a few interesting efforts of trying to create apps or automated system, for people to collect evidence pertaining to tech facilitated harassment in a way that that would be legally admissible. But for those the victim would still have to go through three years of chat history with their abuser. Instead, let&rsquo;s figure out a method to automate that process. Not only is it a traumatizing experience, but also a lot of victims don&rsquo;t have the data literacy to be able to doso. When I was working at a domestic violence clinic in Los Angeles, for example, most of our clients were single, undocumented mothers who didn&rsquo;t speak English, with very low tech literacy. But they would bring screen grabs, they would have to sit through and waded through years of stuff, and they get extremely overwhelmed by tech, and for good reasons. Of course, that&rsquo;s something that tech could actually make easier.\n\n**A case against reporting**\n\nPart of the problem with the design and implementation of these reporting systems is that there is such a fixation on reporting. Data on sexual violence tends to privilege and reinforce reporting as the ideal outcome for survivors. The methodological reason is that data on sexual violence is very difficult to collect, as it relies on self-disclosure and poses ethical challenges, so researchers and policymakers look to reporting data. The social reason is that we see reporting as an active outcome and dismiss others as less legitimate.\n\nBut help-seeking is an extremely iterative and continuing process. It takes victims usually six months to 11 months to even disclose it to anybody, before formally reporting it. And formal reporting is also not necessarily the best outcome for a lot of people: you might share kids with your assailant, you might be worried about their immigration status, or you might just want them to face consequences that don&rsquo;t involve them going away to jail. Thinking about help-seeking and thinking about recovery is often done in a very narrow way: &ldquo;have you reported that?&rdquo; &ldquo;go to the police&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s when you&rsquo;ll get better.\n\nThis attitude gets encoded into the design of reporting systems. Constant notifications and nudges are baked into the flow of the interface to incentivize the user to consider formal reporting. The system vendors seem to think that automated and data-driven tools will point the user to one optimal solution--reporting.\n\nBut this is incredibly misguided. Survivors are not a monolithic group: their experiences of violence, access to resources, recovery process, and ideas of justice are extremely diverse. And this multiplicity should be appreciated, because it gives the society a more robust and relational way of thinking about justice. But the way that reporting tools are designed does not allow for this.\n\nIn addition, a lot of these systems are technically for everyone, but they&rsquo;re usually only adopted by, and used for, privileged and tech savvy English speaking users. For example, workplace harassment system tools are for everybody, which should include anitorial workers, temp workers, contract workers. But they are written out of these systems because they are rarely identified as a potential user or their employment contracts subject them to a different grievance procedure.\n\n**Doing more with &lsquo;small data&rsquo;**\n\nIn my research, I make a case for de-emphasizing reporting. This posed a methodological challenge in conducting my research. How do I gather data about survivors&rsquo; help-seeking experience without relying on reporting data? As I said, we already know that the data we have tends to privilege people who were successful in going through the legal system to report their incidents. This means that victim demographic information and the incidents, assault information, and legal recourse are already extremely partial. The reporting tools I study build their systems based on that data. The data we use reinforce the privileging of reporting as the ideal outcome for survivors. What would it mean for me, then, as a researcher to rely on reporting data?\n\nThis is why I turned to qualitative research and '[small data.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1369118X.2012.678878)'Having a structured conversation with all the different people involved in the design and application process provides better data about reporting systems&rsquo; impact and implications. It might take me several emails, many referrals, and several weeks of relationship building, but the conversations I have with each participant is so rich and insightful and telling, much more than what I could get if I were to do a survey or something.\n\n**De-glammorize tech**\n\nEven after discussing how and why tech solutions to sexual misconduct reporting fails us, the question I often get is: how can we improve the tech we have so that their &lsquo;failures&rsquo; and &lsquo;shortcomings&rsquo; can be overcome? To me, this belief that tech can be improved to perfection to the point of replacing human actors is so fundamentally misguided.\n\nAt the end of the day, these reporting tools are essentially case management systems. The vendors market themselves as a revolutionary innovation to &lsquo;combat seuxal violence&rsquo; and &lsquo;empower survivors.&rsquo; But combating violence and supporting survivors comes from sustained collective action. No new system can or will be able to do that.\n\nRather than asking how tech can be fixed for the better, the more urgent and important question is: who and what are we overlooking when we turn to tech solutions? Social workers, administrators, advocates and activists, and scholars spend years becoming experts in violence prevention and response so that they can serve survivors better. How much money, time, and energy are not going to them, when we spend those resources on tech? These are the people who work directly with victims and are in the best position to inform policies and practices. We should trust what they have to say, because they have experience and have demonstrated that they have the public&rsquo;s interest. The same can&rsquo;t be said for tech solutions.\n\nThe shiny new tech can seem like it can offer accuracy and objectivity. But they can&rsquo;t because they are built by people based on data collected by people. From design to implementation, every point is inculcated with bias. This is not to say that there is no place for data-driven tools. But when we de-glam tech, we can see it for what it is--it&rsquo;s a tool to help us connect, communicate, and make informed decisions. This is why we need to support practitioners in anti-violence space, like social workers, jurors and judges, and advocates, with data and tech literacy, so that they have control over how they interpret and act on data.\n\n**Burning question:** How can we support practitioners in anti-violence space, like social workers, jurors and judges, and advocates, with data and tech literacy, so that they have control over how they interpret and act on data?\n\n## Post a thoughtful comment below ahead of the **[workshop on AI &amp; Justice ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/workshop-on-inequalities-in-the-age-of-ai-what-they-are-how-they-work-and-what-we-can-do-about-them-19-11-brussels/10326)**  on November 19!\nThis will help us to prepare good case studies for exploring these topics in detail.

It includes calendar integration and even reminders by e-mail before the event.\n\n:warning: **IMPORTANT:** Our current Zoom plan allows up to two simultaneous meetings. To make sure that your meeting cannot be blocked by parallel meetings, **_you must schedule your meeting_**. Scheduled meetings are given priority by the conventions in this manual and will never be blocked \u2026 if everyone follows the manual ([more details](#heading--1-6)).\n\n:warning: **IMPORTANT:** Our current Zoom plan allows up to two simultaneous meetings. However, usually **_you should not schedule meetings in parallel_**. This way, the option to have a parallel meeting is our backstop solution for meetings that go overtime and end up in parallel to another scheduled meeting. So by not scheduling in parallel, you don't have to worry about blocking the Zoom room. If you know what you're doing, you _can_ schedule a meeting in parallel to an existing one, but then you _have_ to worry: if another meeting follows yours, be sure to end your meeting in time before, and also communicate to the host of that other meeting if you go overtime so they don't worry.\n\n**To schedule a meeting:**\n\n1. **Go to \"[My account \u2192 My meetings](https://zoom.us/meeting)\".**\n\n2. **Click on \"Schedule a meeting\"** and fill in the information and click \"Save\". This brings you to the meeting's details page. Details to note:\n\n    * When enabling \"Recurring Meeting\", if possible also fill out \"Recurrence\" and don't just leave it at \"No Fixed Time\". A meeting with \"No Fixed Time\" is not a scheduled meeting and might be blocked by other scheduled or spontaneous meetings.\n\n    * Enable the option \"Use personal meeting ID 306-321-0325\". Doing that consistently will slowly get rid of the task to always distribute a new meeting ID / Zoom Join URL, as we have a fixed one this way. It will not block spontaneous meetings, as such meetings cannot happen in parallel to scheduled meetings anyway to not block them.\n\n3. **Add the meeting to our Google Calendar** \"Edgeryders Events\", or to your personal Google Calendar in case you are using Zoom for non-Edgeryders purposes.\n\n    (The following explains the semi-automated process provided by Zoom, but there's nothing wrong with creating the event manually in Google Calendar \u2013 just add the \"Zoom Join URL\" to the location field.)\n\n    1. **Click \"Add to: Google Calendar\".**\n\n    2. **Log in** to your _personal_ Google Account. (Probably you are already.) A screen to create a Google Calendar event will appear.\n\n        Details: This allows Zoom to create events in your calendars, but only on your computer, and only until you sign out of that Google Account again. It does not create a permanent [Google Calendar integration](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360000488243) \u2013 that setting is only for viewing Zoom meetings in the Zoom desktop client.\n\n    3. **Select \"Calendar: Edgeryders Events\".** If you can't see it, you need to get access first \u2013 see our [Calendar Manual](/t/id/9038).\n\n        If you accidentally created the meeting in a different calendar (such as your personal default calendar \"Events\"), delete it as instructed below, and start again. Moving the meeting to a different calendar is possible but will make you run into several Google Calendar bugs, including: your own attendance will be automatically set to \"no\" and you can't change that; and a stale event will occasionally be re-created automatically in the calendar where it was originally created, probably by Zoom.\n\n    4. **Invite participants** with their Google Accounts to the event. This will add the event to participants' Google Calendars and also send them reminders before the start.\n\n    5. **Add reminders** to the event as appropriate.\n\n    6. **Click \"Save\".**\n\n\n**To re-schedule a meeting:**\n\n1. **Go to \"[My account \u2192 My meetings](https://zoom.us/meeting)\".**\n\n2. **Click on the title** of your meeting to go to its details page.\n\n3. **Click \"Edit this meeting\"** at the bottom, make and save your changes.\n\n4. **Click \"Add to: Google Calendar\"** again and add the meeting again to the \"Edgeryders Events\" Google calendar. (This is a bug in Zoom.)\n\n5. **Delete the old calendar entry** of the meeting in the \"Edgeryders Events\" Google Calendar. (This is a bug in Zoom.)\n\n\n**To delete a meeting:**\n\n1. **Go to \"[My account \u2192 My meetings](https://zoom.us/meeting)\".**\n\n2. **Click on the title** of your meeting to go to its details page.\n\n3. **Click \"Delete meeting\".**\n\n4. **Delete the calendar entry** for the meeting in the \"Edgeryders Events\" Google calendar. (This is a bug in Zoom.)\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1-3\">1.3. Scheduling a meeting with a browser extension</h3>\n\n_TODO: It is not clear yet if our account's fixed personal meeting ID can be used with the process below. If not, we don't recommend it as always-changing meeting IDs are confusing._\n\nAs an alternative to the above process, you can [download](https://zoom.us/meeting) Firefox and Chrome extensions to create Zoom meetings from inside Google Calendar. Usage:\n\n1. **At first usage**, click the Zoom button the browser toolbar that was installed by the extension and log into the Zoom Pro account there.\n\n2. **Create an event in the \"Edgeryders Events\" Google Calendar** and click on the \"More Options\" button. Alternatively, edit an existing event. Alternatively, click the browser extension's button and then \"Schedule a Meeting\". All bring you to the detailed event edit dialogue. Always use your personal Google Account for this step; if you don't see the \"Edgeryders Events\" calendar there, [get access first](/t/id/9038).\n\n3. **Click \"Make it a Zoom meeting\".** (If still needed.)\n\n4. **Invite participants and add reminders** as usual.\n\nThe meeting will now automatically appear in the \"[My Meetings](https://zoom.us/meeting)\" section in the Zoom website, and the Google Calendar event will contain the URL to join the meeting. This process is a bit more comfortable but not much: re-scheduling and deleting events need the same workarounds documented for the process in the web interface (see above).\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1-4\">1.4. Testing your bandwidth</h3>\n\nThe quality of the experience with conference calls depend a lot on available bandwidth. Please, before hosting a meeting always test your internet speed and choose the location that will give you more headway. You can use [Google's Internet speed test](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/6283840). In the Reef, the best way to host one is connect via Ethernet to the router in the office.\n\nInternet bandwidth in different locations:\n\n| location                                         | downstream | upstream  |\n|--------------------------------------------------|------------|-----------|\n| The Reef, office, using Ethernet cable           | 64 Mbit/s  | 26 Mbit/s |\n| The Reef, office, using router wifi              | 42 Mbit/s  | 26 Mbit/s |\n| The Reef, living room, using range extender wifi | 10 Mbit/s  | 22 Mbit/s |\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1-5\">1.5. Using a headset</h3>\n\nDo not join a video or audio call using your device's microphone and speakers. This setup is likely to trigger [Larsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_feedback) and echo effects. The person using the laptop's mic and speakers can not hear the latter, but they annoy everyone else. Instead:\n\n* **Headset.** This is the best option, both for desktop and mobile devices. Depending on the device, you will need one of the following connectors: USB, 2\u00d73.5mm TRS audio jack, 2.5 mm or 3.5 mm [TRRS audio jack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio)#PDAs_and_mobile_phones), Bluetooth. Headset microphones are directional microphones, so they pick up sound only when you speak close to them (\u226410 cm) and directly into them \u2013 they will not work when handing them around like a handheld microphone. To prevent pop sounds from air pulses, the proper position is at nose or chin level, not directly in front of the mouth.\n\n* **Earphones.** This also avoids the feedback and echo effects: just wear earphones and speak close enough to the device's microphone. However, the microphone is probably of lower quality, so the sound will generally not be as great. Depending on the microphone type and position, it can be fine to naturally sit in front of the device, but you might also have to place your mouth 10-15 cm in front of the microphone (with the camera off hopefully :smile:).\n\n    To know what solution is adequate, you can ask other participants or (where that is not adequate) look at the microphone signal level indicator of your audio mixer application. When speaking normally, the signal bar length should vary between 50% and 80% of its maximum (assuming the usual logarithmic scaling of the bar).\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1-6\">1.6. Starting a meeting</h3>\n\n**Starting a scheduled meeting.** This is the usual case. At the scheduled time of the meeting, people join the meeting using their locally installed Zoom zoftware and the meeting ID or Join URL (for example `207-791-476` or `207791476` resp. `https://zoom.us/j/207791476`).\n\n**Allow \"Join before host\".** When scheduling a new meeting, there is an option to allow joining before the host, enabled by default. (The host is the first user who joins the meeting after using our Zoom Pro credentials to log in.)\n  &nbsp; When keeping the options at that, no step is necessary to start a meeting \u2013 anyone can join at any time after the start of the meeting. There is not even a need for the host to join at all.\n  &nbsp; When changing that option, the host has to join first and only after that other people can join the meeting. This makes sense for webinars and the like.\n\n**Starting an unscheduled meeting.** For spontaneous meetings or sporadic recurring meetings with no fixed time, you don't have to go through the whole \"schedule a meeting\" process. You can use the following process, but since you must avoid blocking scheduled meetings it's not necessarily simpler:\n\n1. Check at https://zoom.us/meeting or in the Zoom client (after login) in the \"Meetings tab\" when the next meeting is scheduled. (Meetings that are listed as \"Recurring\" without a date and time are not scheduled meetings. Also ignore scheduled meetings that have already been started, as you can't block these.)\n\n    For an unscheduled meeting, you **_must_** make sure to end your meeting before any scheduled meeting (and also in due time before it, such as 30 minutes \u2013 or otherwise let the meeting organizer know you're aware of their meeting and will finish in time). Because otherwise, your group and another group having another spontaneous meeting might end up blocking the Zoom account for the scheduled meeting, as it can host at most two parallel meetings. Since there is no way to see if another spontaneous meeting is in progress, you always have to assume it is.\n\n2. Start the Zoom Client desktop software and [log in](#heading--1-1) with the Edgeryders organization's Zoom account there.\n\n3. Click on \"Start with Video\" or \"Start without Video\" in the Zoom Client desktop software. This will start an unscheduled meeting using Edgeryders' fixed personal meeting ID `306-321-0325`. If that room turns out to be occupied, rather click \"Schedule\" and schedule and then start a meeting with option \"Recurring Meeting\". This will give you a meeting room for spontaneous meetings with a different ID.\n\n    Our current Zoom account allows two meetings in parallel. So if two groups are having a spontaneous meeting already, you're out of luck and won't be able to start a new meeting. That's why scheduled meetings are better \u2013 with the process as shown here, they have priority.\n\n4. Tell others to join your meeting, and give them its meeting ID.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1-7\">1.7. Joining a meeting</h3>\n\n**Required information.** To join a meeting, you need: \n\n* **Meeting ID.** That's a 9-digit or 10-digit number that identifies a meeting.\n* **Meeting passcode.** A shared password needed for access to the meeting. After the so-called \"zoombombing\" nuisance events in early 2020, Zoom made this a requirement for all meetings.\n\nBoth the meeting ID and passcode can be extracted from a \"Zoom Join URL\" that you'll typically fin in an invitation. Here is an example of such a URL, with the meeting ID and passcode highlighted: <code>https:/&ZeroWidthSpace;/us02web.zoom.us/j/&ZeroWidthSpace;<b>87631795901</b>?&ZeroWidthSpace;pwd%3D<b>a28rWDJUcFpUcnFDM1pGWGFFZmNqZz09</b>&&ZeroWidthSpace;sa=D&&ZeroWidthSpace;source=calendar&&ZeroWidthSpace;usd=2&&ZeroWidthSpace;usg=AOvVaw3M5pMk2gCnI8vEmzwkohB3</code>. That URL actually contains only a hashed value of the passcode, but it works just as well as the actual passcode, which here would be `094537`.\n\n\n**How to join a meeting.** There are three main ways:\n\n* **Desktop client.** Open the Zoom desktop client yourself, click \"Join Meeting\" and in field \"Meeting ID or Personal Link Name\" enter the meeting ID. Entering a full Zoom Join URL will not work.\n\n* **Desktop client, via browser.** Open the Zoom Join URL _in your browser_ and confirm to allow it starting the Zoom desktop client to join the associated meeting. So far, this never works under Linux, so here you're better off to automatically redirect these URLs to the web client, using the [Zoom Redirector](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/zoom-redirector/) Firefox extension.\n\n* **Web client.** Open the Zoom Join URL _in your browser_ and let it open the web client to join that way. Both Firefox and Chrome work, but fewer audio and video quality issues are expected with Chrome, esp. on slower machines. Still, **avoid using the web client** when you can, because it generates much more CPU load than the desktop client, which on slower machines can lead to broken up audio when speaking, and to other quality issues.\n\n\n**Personal Meeting ID.** A meeting organizer can choose to use either a unique meeting ID for the meeting, or to re-use the fixed, so-called \"Personal Meeting ID\" that belongs to the Egeryders Zoom Pro account. This personal meeting ID of Edgeryders is:\n\n* **meeting ID:** `306-321-0325`\n* **password:** (unknown, may change between meetings)\n* **Zoom Join URL:** https://zoom.us/j/3063210325\n* **mnemonic:** it spells \"EDGERYDERS\" in a botched-up \"[Franco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_chat_alphabet)-Latin\" script. Haha! :laughing:\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1-8\">1.8. Using the chat</h3>\n\nLike most conference call applications, Zoom comes with in-call chat functionalities. Access the chat using the dedicated button in the lower part of the app window. \n\nIn Edgeryders, we recommend using liberally the chat for any meeting with more than four people in it. It is a great way that people can make a point or take note of something the speaker just said, *without interrupting her*. This is particularly useful as in conference calls it can be difficult to use body language to signal that one wants to speak. \n\nAnother advantage of the chat is that its log can (and should) be saved at the end of the meeting. \n\n**Beware: if you use one-to-one chats, they will *also* be saved with the public chat, so they will become accessible to everyone who sees that saved file**. A good rule of thumb for 1-on-1 chats is: don't use them.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1-9\">1.9. Zoomtiquette</h3>\n\nOur experience with videoconferencing so far has suggested some rules of behavior that will make the call more pleasure for you and your workmates. \n\n* ***Always* use headsets**. See above, but seriously. This is important. Do it.\n* **Join the call from a quiet room with a fast connection**, if at all possible. If you know you are going to be on a train, or in a caf\u00e9, it is courtesy to inform the host beforehands. \n* **Leave the camera on**. Some folks have trouble seeing conference calls as \"real meetings\". We find that turning on your camera expresses courtesy and attention, and tends to make everyone's behavior more professional. Don't worry about other people's bandwidth: Zoom's servers act as \"mixers\" for the audio and video feed, so that *other people's* bandwidth is not much affected by *your* choice of leaving your camera on.\n* **Use the chat** for any meeting with more than four people in it. It is a great way that people can make a point or take note of something the speaker just said, *without interrupting her* .This is particularly useful as in conference calls it can be difficult to use body language to signal that one wants to speak. But beware the 1-on-1 chats (see above, 1.8). \n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2. Our setups</h2>\n\nA successful videoconference depends crucially on how much care you take of the audio part. This section contains tips and tricks, both technical and organizational, for organizing video conferences. \n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-1\">2.1. \"Reading group meeting\" setup</h3>\n\nIn reading group meetings we have a hybrid situation: a physical gathering with 3-8 people, plus some more people joining from remote. We are using the following setup:\n\n* **No video.** Saves bandwidth, and there is nothing to see anyway.\n\n* **Screen sharing.** We share our screen with an on-topic image [like the meeting's e-flyer](https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/9/91a6cced495f0bc4474702f41f43d6ca567c7823.jpg).\n\n* **Remote interaction.** Interaction with remote people is provided by chat and bidirectional audio. The chat needs a local MC to \"stand watch\" to the Zoom application, and tell the room remote people want to speak.\n\n* **Microphone.** at The Reef, we use an [AKG C 414 B-TL II](https://www.akg.com/support/C414+B-TL+II_.html) professional condenser microphone. Any good quality condenser mic will do. It's important that it is a condenser, because it means that it can pick up with great clarity sound sources at 2-3 meters from the microphone. No need to pass it around, so no disruption to the conversation in the room. The polarity selector on the AKG is set to omnidirectional. The microphone is then placed on the table, or in the middle of the circle where people are going to be discussing. Omnidirectional capacity is also important. A boom is a good idea.\n\n* **Audio board / interface.** We use a [Centrance MicPort Pro](http://www.centrance.com/products/mp/) USB board to connect the mic to the computer. Industry standard for microphones like the AKG dictates they run on 48 V \"phantom\" power carried by [XLR connectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XLR_connector); the MicPort provides that by converting USB power internally. So all you need is a normal XLR cable to connect your mic to it. To switch on phantom power, you need to press the little button on the end of the device \u2013 otherwise the microphone will not work.\n\n* **Speakers.** Audio-out is provided by any computer speaker. The laptop's own speaker are not a bad idea: in our tests, they can be turned on at full volume at the same time as the microphone, without any feedback at all and without the remote speaker hearing her own voice echoing back.\n\n    It is probably a good idea for the local MC to keep the speakers muted, unless when a person wants to speak. This is to prevent sounds from remote (for example people sitting in caf\u00e9s) to disturb the local meeting.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/38eac254ef18f8ba6974e6540bec485b9bc1b4a2.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"517\">\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--3\">3. Advanced topics</h2>\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-1\">3.1. Remote logout</h3>\n\nAn attractive feature of Zoom is that, if you inadvertently share your login data in a non-secure location, or if your laptop/phone/tablet with access to Zoom is stolen or lost, you can \"force sign out\" all devices using your Zoom account. If this happens to you, do the following:\n\n1. Go to our profile page: https://zoom.us/profile\n2. Click on \"Sign Me Out From All Devices\" \n3. You are prompted to change your password \n\nSymmetrically, changing your password will sign out the account from all devices.\n\nThis feature is probably also a viable hack to unblock the Edgeryders Zoom Pro account when starting your scheduled meeting is not possible due to two meetings being in progress. If no other scheduled meeting is in progress, that means you'll only end spontaneous meetings by people who did not follow this manual, so that's ok :slight_smile: Be sure to change the Edgeryders Zoom Pro account password back to its original value afterwards, as otherwise everyone would have to find out the new password before being able to log in again.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-2\">3.2. End-to-end encryption</h3>\n\nA Zoom meeting host can enforce end-to-end encryption of all content of a meeting, which is advisable for sensitive topics. We currently do not have it enabled by default, but could if tests confirm that there are no issues with joining or CPU load for any participant.\n\nTo enable it:\n\n1. In the Zoom account's web interface, go to \"[My Meeting Settings \u2192 Meeting](https://zoom.us/profile/setting) \u2192 In Meeting (Basic)\".\n\n2. Enable \"End-to-end encryption\".\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-3\">3.3. Viewing upcoming meetings in the desktop client</h3>\n\nThis allows to see your upcoming Zoom meetings in the \"Meetings\" tab of your Zoom desktop client software.\n\n**For participants (logged into a free Zoom Basic account).** Set up the desktop client calendar integration as described [in the Zoom Help Center](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360000488243). Then, the Meetings tab of your Zoom desktop client will list all events of the current day to which you have been invited via an invitation sent to your Google Account.\n\n**For hosts (logged into our Zoom Pro account).** This works automatically because:\n\n> \"The Meetings tab of your Zoom desktop client will show any Zoom meetings found on your calendar for that day [and] [\u2026] _any meetings that you have scheduled on your Zoom account, regardless of day_.\" \n> \n> ([source](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360000488243-Desktop-Client-Calendar-Integration#google), emphasis ours)\n\nAnd according to our tests, \"meetings that you have scheduled on your Zoom account\" includes meetings scheduled with the Zoom browser extensions, as the Zoom browser extension has to be connected to this Zoom Pro account before it can be used. So it will all just work.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-4\">3.4. Use with virtual desktops</h3>\n\nAt least under Linux, the Zoom desktop software has an annoying behavior: whenever switching to a different virtual desktop, the Zoom main window will be minimized into a small 4\u00d73 cm window hovering on top of whatever window you have on the other desktop.\n\nThis can be fixed by pinning the main window to all desktops at once. It will then be not automatically minimized, and you can put other windows you work with on top on some desktops, while having it the top window on the desktop you use for the call.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-5\">3.5. Useful keyboard shortcuts</h3>\n\nSince the toolbar of the Zoom main window will only be active on hover during a call, the most comfortable way to access some functions is by using hotkeys. (You can however change that in the program's accessibility settings screen under \"Always show meeting control toolbar\".)\n\nThe hotkeys are all described in a [Zoom support article](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/205683899). The most useful ones are:\n\n* **Mute / unmute audio.** Allows to use Zoom without a headset, as you can just mute yourself except when you speak, which prevents any echo feedback for others.\n\n    * <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd> on Windows / Linux\n\n    * <kbd>Command \u2318</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd> on Mac\n\n* **Display / hide the chat window.**\n\n    * <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>H</kbd> on Windows / Linux\n\n    * <kbd>Command \u2318</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>H</kbd> on Mac\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-6\">3.6. Calling across different time zones</h3>\n\nParticipation from different time zones is a frequent source of frustration in conference calls. Some participants might have to compromise on joining at times that do not work well for them. This, unfortunately, can only be managed, not solved.\n\nAnother common source of frustration is that people show up too early or too late because of time zone confusion. For this, we have been recommended [everytimezone](https://everytimezone.com). To use it, select a date and time, then click on the \"link\" button to get a link and share it with participants. Example: \n\n> Check you have the right time [here](https://everytimezone.com/s/b6de204c).\n\n The link translates that date and time into the date and time of every time zone. Hat tip: @phoresced.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-7\">3.7. Recording a meeting</h3>\n\nOnly the host of a meeting has the features available in Zoom to record the meeting and to save the chat.\n\n**Chat archiving.** For saving the chat, the host does not have to remember anything. It will be saved automatically to your computer \u2013 just remember to upload / publish it after the call if required. If you are not the meeting host, you can still copy&paste the chat manually.\n\n**Recording a meeting.** To record a meeting, the host has to start that manually. They will be offered a choice to record on local storage or cloud storage. There is no option to record only the audio. Since we don't want our information to be all over the place, typically choose to record on your own computer, and then upload the result to a Google Team Drive.\n\n  After the end of the call, the Zoom client will start to convert a locally saved recording to a 75% smaller MP4 format, both in a video and audio-only version. Usually, you would keep and upload the audio and delete the video version, to save space and data transfer times. Only for calls that used screensharing extensively, keep and upload the video. If the conversion does not happen automatically (for example because the computer crashed during a call), you can start it manually at an time from the \"Meetings \u2192 Recorded\" area in the Zoom desktop client.\n\n**Finding the recordings again.** All meetings that you recorded, whether on your computer or \"in the cloud\" will be accessible from within the Zoom desktop client (after login) under \"Meetings \u2192 Recorded\". This also allows to open the folder with the corresponding files, which will be found here by default:\n\n* Linux: `~/Documents/Zoom/`\n\n**Recording only the audio.** Recording both video and audio while being in a video call with the camera on can strain the CPU of older computers a lot. Instead, you can record the audio channel only, using other software. *[TODO: Instructions for Linux, Windows, Mac OS X]*", "created_at": "2018-07-23 14:25:12.053668", "updated_at": "2020-10-21 16:53:15.967421", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4889, "wiki": true, "reads": 35, "score": 9359.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4022, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 37376, "user_id": 2464, "topic_id": 7261, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Just got this message from Fabrizio Sestini.

Also, please help us creating awareness about it and the need to endorse it (or to comment it): first, among your consortium partners, and then on all communication channels which you consider relevant. With your help, we will give a stronger voice to the Digital Social Innovation communities in Europe, helping to obtain support for bottom-up initiatives and raising the public and political awareness about the importance of digital social innovation and its concrete impact._\n_I also wish to reiterate the importance of effectively interacting with the CAPS coordination project which is currently running, CHIC, which is working on essential communication items which will maximise the reach of your activities and create critical mass, such as the updated version of the CAPS Magazine and the CAPSSI website, which includes a dedicated Section to promote the best results from your projects. Please help them (Monique & Co.) to make the best out of all your exceptional initiatives!_\n_Looking forward to meeting you at next events, such as the Social Innovation conference in Lisbon [https://ec.europa.eu/research/conferences/2017/era/index.cfm](https://ec.europa.eu/research/conferences/2017/era/index.cfm) , or the next CAPS community meeting which will take place at the beginning of 2018 in Brussels (further details to come soon), kind regards,_\n_Fabrizio_\n\n_Fabrizio Sestini_\n_ATT21328 1.jpg_\n_European Commission_\n_DG Communications Networks, Content and Technology_", "created_at": "2017-10-03 07:57:51.556119", "updated_at": "2018-11-22 21:27:10.402607", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 395, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 56.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3769], "is_private": false}, {"id": 52355, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 9432, "post_number": 13, "raw": "https://codastory.com/news/eu-new-road-safety-laws-civil-liberties/", "created_at": "2019-04-06 16:32:24.502825", "updated_at": "2019-04-06 16:32:24.502825", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 11, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}]
