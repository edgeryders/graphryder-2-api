(example: laptops, software etc). Available onsite on the 24th, 25th and 26th at the venue (International School of Economics) will be rooms, chairs, wifi, sockets, a projector, probably flipcharts, indoor + outdoor space. Anything else you'll have to ask for and we'll try to make it happen. For example, activities at Vake Park might need a lighter dress code, musical instruments brought along, bikes etc?</span></li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"width: 100%;\">\n\n<thead>\n\n<tr>\n\n<th scope=\"col\"><span>DAY 1: June 24\n\nvenue:<a href=\"/t/practical-info/3104\"> ISET</a></span></th>\n\n<th scope=\"col\"><span>Title and link</span></th>\n\n<th scope=\"col\"><span>Who leads it?</span></th>\n\n</tr>\n\n</thead>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td>15:00-19:00</td>\n\n<td>Barcamp: marathon of ad hoc, informal talks lead by participants.\n\n<a href=\"/t/swarmcomms-harnessing-our-collective-online-presence-to-support-one-another/3154\">Swarmcomms: harnessing our collective online presence to support one another</a>\n\nCrash course: online collaboration using the Edgeryders platform\n\n+ your sessions created on the spot.</td>\n\n<td>Nadia</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td>19:00-22:00</td>\n\n<td><a href=\"/t/lets-cook-ourselves-some-foodzies/3133\"><font color=\"#000000\">Social cooking party at Bauhaus Cafe!</font></a></td>\n\n<td>@Inge</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<th scope=\"col\"><span>DAY 2: June 25\n\nvenue: <a href=\"/t/practical-info/3104\">ISET</a></span></th>\n\n<th scope=\"col\">\u00a0</th>\n\n<th scope=\"col\">\u00a0</th>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td>10:00-10:30</td>\n\n<td>Welcome word</td>\n\n<td>@Nadia</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td>10:30-11:15</td>\n\n<td><a href=\"/t/leadership-sharing-and-bureaucracy-can-we-work-together/3008\"><font color=\"#000000\">Leadership, Sharing and Bureaucracy</font></a></td>\n\n<td><a href=\"/u/hexayurt\"><font color=\"#000000\">@Vinay Gupta</font></a></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td>11:30-13:00</td>\n\n<td>The Future Now part I (parallel sessions)\n\n<a href=\"/t/how-basic-economic-literacy-can-increase-a-nations-welfare-case-of-georgia/3045\">Future welfare: teaching basic economic literacy, case of Georgia</a>\n\n<a href=\"/t/session-for-edgeryder-meeting-in-tbilisi/3047\">Future fundraising: building trust and meaning</a>\n\nFuture Economy: carpooling in Armenia and all over the world.</td>\n\n<td>Tamara Kurdadze\n\n@Boris\n\nAnna Meliksetyan</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td>14:30-16:00</td>\n\n<td>The Future Now part II (parallel sessions)\n\n<a href=\"/t/social-activists-monuments-in-armenia/3164\">Future activism: monuments in Armenia</a>\n\nFuture cities: urban planning for citizenry (online soon)</td>\n\n<td>@Enli\n\nElene Margvelashvili &amp;

height: 233px;\">\n\n<strong>Not kidding!</strong> Edgeryders' very own consulting and foresight agency <em>Edgeryders LbG</em> just got contracted by the United Nations Development Programme to work in Nepal. Edgeryders community member <a href=\"/u/natalia_skoczylas\">@Natalia_Skoczylas</a> will join me to work \"on the ground\" in Kathmandu, Nepal, starting in two weeks. And everyone else in the Edgeryders community can join us remotely via this platform (see below). I promise us all a fascinating three months adventure :)\n\n<strong>Why we're heading to Nepal.</strong> Because Edgeryders, and I mean the whole \"ecosystem\", has the rare skill of gathering input from the edges of society and of connecting the edges to institutions in constructive dialogue.\n\nIt's similar to what Edgeryders did in the very beginning. Back in 2012, Council of Europe was looking for new voices from \"youth in transition\", and the Edgeryders project brought them in. Now, it is UNDP Nepal looking for new voices to help build a more democratic, inclusive and resilient society.\n\nUNDP calls these new voices \"alternative leaders\", we call them \"edgeryders\":  grassroots activists, social innovators, hackers and makers, all kinds of engaged citizens on the edges of society. Both UNDP and of course we as Edgeryders believe that bringing in these alternative voices, from outside mainstream society and formal political processes, into the national conversation will help spark new exchanges and ideas. We are not at all called to care about a specific social or political issue. Instead, this project is meant to open the way for creative approaches to difficult problems, to strengthen and energize civil society in Nepal in multiple ways. A great fit, since wherever we found alternative leaders / edgeryders so far, they were pro-active engaged citizens who found the issues they care about and to solve all by themselves. We're there to listen, and to connect them. That's all \u2013 a modest contribution, but still a daunting task, and we're glad to have it :)\n\n<strong>How you can be part of the adventure.</strong> Makers, hackers and other empowered citizens are a global phenomenon. Which means we <em>expect</em> to find edgeryders in Nepal, to find that our method works, and to have a great \u2013 productive and meaningful \u2013 time together across national, cultural and linguistic boundaries. That's just what Edgeryders do when they meet. And we invite you to experience another round of Edgeryders magic when meeting your Nepali brothas and sistas. There is more than one way:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Get updates about Nepal's Edgeryders.</strong> Just <a href=\"/t/future-makers-nepal/598\">go to the Future Makers Nepal project</a> (the name is preliminary yet), then click \"Follow\". You'll get an e-mail notification when people post to this space. This includes blog posts, photos and videos by Natalia and me, and of course the actual contributions by Nepal's alternative leaders.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Look behind your horizon.</strong> For social innovators and changemakers, Nepal and its continuing transition from monarchy to \"absolute democracy\" is great stuff. Like many \"small\" nations, Nepal has an agile, fast-moving modern history to learn from. I won't digress into a history lesson just yet, because I could only quote events from the books and would surely get their significance wrong. But you can read things up by yourself for now (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Nepal#Revolution_of_1951\">just start here</a>), and I promise to come back with horizon-expanding posts when I start to understand Nepal's history more first-hand.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Do you know a latent edgeryder in Nepal? </strong>If you know of Edgeryders-ish people, projects and organizations in Nepal and are happy to share the \"lead\", we invite you to leave a comment below. Thank you!</li>\n\n<li><strong>Share your experience and knowledge.</strong> Like all public projects on edgeryders.eu, it's an open discussion. You are invited to comment on posts, and write your own posts. Just as you like updates from Nepal, they will like your input as \"from the international community\".</li>\n\n<li><strong>Join the video calls.</strong> We plan to have weekly open video calls where we can all hang out together as a truly cosmopolitan community of grassroots changemakers. Interested? We're pretty sure you are.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Collaborations, collaborations.</strong> Many Egeryders collaborations just pop up when somebody realizes an opportunity. You might be that person this time and end up with a new project and new friends. You never know!</li>\n\n<li><strong>Come visit!</strong> We plan to get a space in Kathmandu with a spare room from May to July 2015. The spare room will be free to claim for any Edgeryder. If you're around, please say hi and stay for some days!</li>\n\n<li><strong>Keep us organized!</strong> If you want to be involved at a deeper level or just noticed something that can be organized better, tell us in the Future Makers Nepal Coordination project. It's a public space as well and separate only to shield participants from too many e-mails about boring organizational stuff. We invite you also to share your thoughts on our method: What's great, what is not, and how can we improve?</li>\n\n<li><strong>Next time, you could even be part of the team.</strong> This time, Natalia is our official \"trainee\" for immersive training in the Edgeryders method. Next time, she might introduce somebody else, which means <em>you</em> could be part of the ground team then. Don't count on it, but as Natalia can tell, interesting projects can happen to you just by expressing interest in a collaboration early on :)</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>But does it really work? It feels like magic!</strong> The \"Edgeryders method\" is not the solution, it's a method to find solutions by looking for and connecting those overlooked people who have the solutions <em>already</em>. And yes, the \"Edgeryders method\" of creating such inclusive dialogue works. If it feels like magic, that's when it works! :)\n\nReally so: I had this epiphany about Edgeryders at its first big conference, where 200 of us gathered. I was there as a rural hacker (\"more great ideas than great friends\"), and when in the midst of the first big Edgeryders meet &amp; greet, I realized I had just met more fascinating people and made more friends in the last three hours than in the last three years combined. Magic! Pure magic! (May I also recommend <a href=\"/u/gazbia_sorour\">@gazbee_sorour</a>'s <a href=\"/t/when-the-world-tells-us-we-have-to-be-small-we-have-to-remind-ourselves-that-we-can-be-giants-together-nadia/2871\">beautiful tale from last year</a> \u2013 it's the best story about realizing that \"Edgeryders works\" that I know of.)\n\n<small style=\"\"><em>Photo: Kathmandu Roofscape I, by McKay Savage, <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/mckaysavage/493491524\">via flickr</a>.

Maybe do the first one like that, then gauge interest for follow-up versions, and if there is, <em>then</em> care about sustainability / proper funding for these?\n\nBut your process, Nadia, is great for finding a sustainability model for each of the circular economy projects that will be involved. If using this process in the runup to the OSCE days, it would make it a kind of OSCE business incubator, being attractive to participants partially for this prospect of getting help to set up a \"sustainable sustainability business\".\n\nThe advantage of the circular economy topic, compared to most other open source stuff, is that it deals with physical goods and upcycling. So often enough, straightforward business models are possible. Some project ideas with business models, off the top of my head:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>Open hardware paper pelletizer.</strong> If somebody develops such a machine, the business model is to sell these machines. Home owners, truck dwellers and everything else with a wood stove would surely buy them, as it allows free space heating: just ask your neighbors if you can have their paper trash \u2026</li>\n\n<li><strong>Electronics Remanufacturing.</strong> This has been all the hype in 2012 (see <a href=\"http://ma.juii.net/blog/recommerce-websites-on-earth\">this list</a> in my blog). Since then it has cooled down and margins have become lower, but my <a href=\"http://ma.juii.net/blog/freedom-fones-knowledge-base\">recent tests</a> with a strategy of focusing on some models only were quite encouraging. This of course needs a collaborative buy-in platform with multiple buyers, each specializing in some products. <em>Incidentally</em>, we have exactly that one-of-a-kind software around. We developed it as a cooperative strategy to cope with falling margins when Aamazon and eBay entered the remanufacturing markets in 2012, but then ran out of resources to market and establish that platform. If a group around the OSCE days would become interested in operating it, we could negotiate something :) It's a business model that can work, esp. in emerging markets like India, but needs sweat equity by a medium-sized group to get it all started properly.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Freedom Fones.</strong> This has been another business idea that I worked on for some time. It's about adding some upcycling to the smartphone remanufacturing, making the results more valuable. Namely, in the light of the post-Snowden area, it's about (1) removing all of Google from an Android phone, (2) removing all spyware like Google's wifi location gathering, (3) rooting the phone, installing <a href=\"http://cyanogenmod.org/\">CyanogenMod</a> and adding <a href=\"http://ma.juii.net/blog/recommendable-android-apps\">recommendable open source Android apps</a>. Often enough, this can bring newest Android 4 to phones whose latest official version is Android 2.3 (which makes them \"disposable trash\" to many people).

Lets go back to this conversation and look at what came out of it\n\nCitation from the workshop:\u00a0\n\n<strong>SIDENOTE 2: Alkasem was again the most disruptive thinker in the group and gave us a lot to think. For him, everything moves around friendship. He has the feeling that a lot of people in western society start of with mistrust. If you start with mistrust it is difficult to create trust.\u00a0And without trust no skill can be shared. This intervention of him started a discussion about the meaning of trust and how we can build that.</strong>\n\n\u201c\u2018Trust is an enabler to use the resources.\u00a0How can that be created inside an eclectic group like this?\u2019,asked Yannick.\u00a0 For Claire it is a text and rules of engagement and a clear path of conflict resolution, and a way to learn to treat each other better.\u00a0\n\nWinnie reacted that your own people's trust is a constant, but gaining the network's trust is more difficult.\n\nWith the help of Nadia we\u00a0made a synthesis of the discussion\n\n1) Working trust is very different from social trust; and there needs to be a boundary.\u00a0\n\n2) What also worked for her is deciding to work on even a small project.\n\n3) A story that binds us together - understanding how our different activities are related\n\n4) Documentation: what does it mean? for us it has been in writing.\n\nFinding each other strengths and weaknesses by organizing small events with each other, and beginning with things that don't have something big at stake. Because then we can learn about each other. The importance of documentation in building trust: Leaving a story behind that people can follow.\n\nWhen the discussion was coming to an end we all felt we had got a lot of information and the workshop was going to close. So Nadia came up with a good idea to end the workshop with something concrete. We all felt that one of the biggest issues in care is that we live to much on our own island and that if we want to make care better we need to share and collaborate. But to collaborate we need to create trust. So this exercise was given to every participant and will hopefully end up in solidifying the care network in Belgium. The following question was asked:\n\nWhat can i bring to another organization, that also better myself as a person and is easily realizable?\n\nThis question will be asked again at the next meeting we are organizing. If you want to join, fill in the framadate and put your contacts in comment. We will update this discussion at that point and see how we have concretized the thrust issue.\n\n<a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://framadate.org/gWB9QN65MCyedmrL&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1475931805799000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG0wzY1P0Z3stHc5enQZ0BXu1JbLA\" href=\"https://framadate.org/gWB9QN65MCyedmrL\" target=\"_blank\">https://framadate.org/<wbr></wbr>gWB9QN65MCyedmrL</a>\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-10-07 13:06:44", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 05:03:24.787454", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 606, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26744, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 3354, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>Can we put together a list of sources of travel funding?</b>\n\nI posted a few <a href=\"/task-3627\">here</a>.

I stuck in this notebook articles, photos, etc. I transcribed passages from books that I liked. <span><span>My notebook</span> <span>became so</span> <span>thick that it</span> was no<span> longer possible to close it. </span></span><span><span>Loose</span> <span>pages</span> <span>fell</span><span> out. </span></span>When my son was born, I transposed the content of this notebook on beautiful 12x12 inches scrapbook pages, and inserted them into an elegant classy creamy white binder (intended for brides). I took the most important passages, delivered them to my lawyer, and demanded that they be added to my will. Because this is what I value most: the knowledge that I have accumulated over the years. This knowledge led me to happiness.\n\nOn numerous occasions during my life, I was discouraged. <span><span>There was no one</span> <span>to comfort me.</span> <span>I have been </span><span>alone</span> <span>most of</span> <span>my life. </span></span>Hundreds of times, I laid on my bed to leaf through my black book.\n\nLast Sunday, I was having lunch with a family from Romania. The young mother told me, watching tenderly her son play with mine, that when she lived in Romania, she had not learned, it was never been said to her that she is able to do things. She thought she was capable of nothing. I do not know if this is a widespread feeling there. But it struck me as being a major impediment to personal and professional development.\n\nMotivation, I see it as being intrinsically linked to individual empowerment. Of course, it helps to have people around to motivate us. But the real motivation comes from ourselves.\n\nSocial Media and Twitter did not exist when I started my black notebook. Now, I participate in communities of people who discuss topics that inspire them. It fascinates me to realize that there are people who likes to talk for an hour about passion, compassion, etc. Responses from these people are wonderful. Today, I no longer need a notebook, because I found many answers along the way, and I am comfortable being a member of online communities. But if I could be 20 years old a second time, I'd do it again: I would have my notebook.\n\nHere, with Noemi and others, we could discuss about what motivates us, what motivates people.\n\nLyne - Kiss hug XO\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4144/5396236133_08a9c0b636.jpg\">\n\n", "created_at": "2011-12-15 20:12:46", "updated_at": "2017-09-21 10:59:31.725466", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 605, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 25.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3643, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3610, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/8/8c87eae606c8af0d85c9e64d63b6b7756a35e77b.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"362\"><br>\n\nA few months ago I gave a public talk\u00a0on the <a href=\"http://unmonastery.org/\">unMonastery</a>. I made the point that Saint Benedict can rightfully be considered a social innovator of titanic stature, and that modern-day open source hackers and activists could do worse than letting themselves inspire from monastic life in their quest to improve our world and live in harmony with it and each other.\u00a0\u00a0Someone showed a\u00a0<a href=\"http://video.repubblica.it/next/rnext-gli-hacker-civici-che-disegnano-la-citta-del-futuro/162878/161367\">video recording</a>\u00a0of the talk to Nicola Alemanno, <a href=\"http://www.comune.norcia.pg.it/organi-politici/\">mayor of Nursia</a>\u00a0\u2013\u00a0the birthplace of Benedict himself. He was intrigued, and offered me and an unMonasterian delegation to meet with Father Cassian Folsom OSB, the superior of <a href=\"http://osbnorcia.org/\">Saint Benedict's monastery</a> in town.\n\nNo way I was going to pass on the opportunity. The six-months <a href=\"http://www.cottica.net/2013/04/03/the-road-to-the-unmonastery-three-low-cost-moves-towards-becoming-a-smart-community/\">unMonastery prototype in Matera</a>\u00a0has shown just how complex setting up and stewarding a healthy community is. Benedictine monks have been around for fifteen centuries, and have accumulated a lot of insight that it is not so accessible\u00a0for us saeculars. So, <a href=\"/u/ben\">@Ben</a>, <a href=\"/u/mariabyck\">@mariabyck</a>\u00a0and I traveled to Umbria, in the heart of Italy's Appennines; accepted Father Cassian's invitation to assist to the monks'\u00a0Mass (celebrated in Latin, and chanted \u2013 no spoken word at all,\u00a0<a href=\"http://youtu.be/o9fDs9_eWY4?t=2m29s\">like this</a>); and then sat\u00a0with him and Nicola in an office in the\u00a0city hall for a solid two hours.\n\nWe learned a lot. What was perhaps most interesting was exploring the common ground between\u00a0monks and unMonasterians. This is neither\u00a0as narrow nor as superficial as you might think.\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">Where we converge</h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Work is\u00a0the forge of better, happier people</h3>\n\nBenedictines hold\u00a0work to be a good thing in and of itself. By doing work, monks can dedicate their lives to a superior ideal while remaining psychologically balanced. Progress in their work is both figuratively and literally progress in their faith; and the concrete nature of\u00a0work helps monks keep their eyes on the ball. Notice that what's good is not so much the\u00a0<em>result</em> of doing work as its\u00a0<em>act. </em>The ultimate purpose of work is to produce cheerful, peaceful,\u00a0happy monks. So, it does not matter what the work actually does; what matters is how it is done.\n\nMost hackers, activists and social innovators and unMonasterians take solace in their work too. Like monks, unMonasterians believe their work is important, but only very few think it will single-handedly \"change the world\". Almost all projects within our reach are quite small. And yet, they\u00a0<em>feel </em>important. Even the smallest and least influential open source project\u00a0encodes a better world: the\u00a0sharing\u00a0of knowledge, generosity with one's time, the attempt to make the world ever so slightly better and more free.\u00a0Like monks, unMonasterians don't do work because they think it is all-important and world-changing: they do it because they like to, because it makes them into the people they want to be.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Communities are\u00a0the natural dimension of human life and work</h3>\n\nBenedictine monks live together in semi-secluded communities. The reason for the detachment part is simple: they want\u00a0to\u00a0partially<span>\u00a0</span>remove themselves from society at large, because society continuously bombards its members\u00a0with stimuli that lead us away from God's work. But why a community?\u00a0In principle you could be a monk alone, an anchorite or hermit. But that turns out to be very hard, in fact impossible to most people (\u201cYour thoughts become your enemy. You could go mad\u201d, said gravely Father Cassian).\n\nThe solution offered by the Rule is, as so many things when Benedict is involved, peer-to-peer. Monks come together in communities, and each helps the other stay on track. Each monk is like a beacon for every other monk, broadcasting a continuous stream of information encoded in example: \"this is the right path, you are on track\", or \"here is how you could get even closer to our ultimate goal\". With appropriate seclusion, the monastic community\u00a0can guide each individual monk along the commonly chosen path, drowning out the noise of saecular society. Notice the architectural beauty of the solution: the community is not \"a thing\". It is an emergent property of monks living together according to the Rule, a well-structured ghost. And yet <em>it works</em>, as any monk will tell you.\n\nunMonasterians share with monks a yearning to belong to a community that has different values and a different logic from those of society at large. In the\u00a0calm of the unMonastery in Matera,\u00a0overworked hackers and highly strung activists found themselves surrounded by like-minded people and felt like they could finally breathe. Suddenly no one was asking why would you not take a corporate job, or what's so terribly wrong about proprietary software or data. Suddenly questioning fiat money or the right of government or corporations to implant backdoors on your computer or crunch your data through Big Data algorithms was <em>normal.</em>\u00a0The ever-present risk of burnout seemed to subside; work acquired more clarity. The doors of the house were always open, and many people came to visit (no seclusion in that sense), but some unMonasterians\u00a0did not like to leave the premises and tended to stay in a lot.\n\nAs an added benefit, living together in a community turns (some) drudgery into a source of pleasure. Just like in monasteries, at the unMonastery people took turns in cooking, washing up, and cleaning the space for the benefit of all. This turns out to be a great solution: when you are not on kitchen duty, life is good: you can move directly from your workspace to the dinner table, and a warm meal will be waiting. But when you <em>are</em>, life is also good: you have to set aside 2-3 hours (which is good, because it prevents you obsessing too much about work and burning out); typically you cook with another person, so you socialise and may even talk shop; and then you get an extra kick from giving your unBrethren a good meal. People will smile and thank you, and you will have made someone's life better. Giving away some control over your day results in your day being better; having a non-negotiable commitment to accepting structure in your life helps people stay balanced. This discovery would be a lot more impressive if Benedict had not encoded it in his Rule fifteen centuries ago. D'oh, I guess \u2013 though Father Cassian, charitably, did not actually say it .\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">The Rule (or Protocol) as the basis of community life</h3>\n\nBenedictine monasteries run on the Benedict's Rule, which <a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/unhagiography-what-modern-day-social-innovators-can-learn-from-the-life-and-times-of-st\">we interpret as a software protocol</a>. The unMonastery has something performing the same function: we are calling it Protocol. We are not quite ready to write Protocol 1.0 yet: people are experimenting with simple rules (small R) you could write in few lines of code at a time (example: who does the work gets to make the related decisions). But we know it's coming. By the way, I have a hunch you could design tests for candidate rules <a href=\"/t/the-quest-for-protocol-1-0-testing-unmonastic-life-myself/3052\">using methods from computational biology</a> \u2013 a weekend project I'll have to leave to less busy times.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Radicalize or die</h3>\n\nLike all great open source projects, the Rule has been forked countless times. Even now the order is running different versions in different monasteries, and abbotts compare notes as to which variants produce which changes. The monastery in Nursia has elected to go back to the original version, and enforce it in a particularly strict way. Father Cassian thinks that the modernization of the Church's ways introduced with the Second Vatican Council does not work well for the monastic movement. There seems to be a minimal threshold of radicalization below which a monastic community is simply not sustainable: societal pressure to conform overcomes the monks' will. The Nursia community, with its long days (starting at 3.45 or 4.00 am), its rigorously chanted nine prayers a day, its fasting practices (one meal a day for a great part of the year, and never more than two), is prospering: the monks are \"reasonably at peace\", and novices flock in.\n\nThe unMonastery has had no variants yet, and its sense of identity is frail at best. And yet, many of us would resonate with Father Cassian's plan \u00a0\u2013 certainly Ben, Maria and I did. The unMonastery can do social innovation, perhaps, but it should probably not get elbow deep into grant finance, or be saddled with too many deliverables. It should definitely\u00a0not attempt to follow the flavour of the day (\u201csmart city\u201d, \u201cstartups\u201d, \u201cbig data\u201d, \u201cscaling up\u201d, and the dreaded \u201cinnovation\u201d). It should probably take pride in its decentralist ideology, 200-years time horizon, geek culture and weird ways. No point being another vanilla co-working space. Certainly, the radical choice to look to monasticism rather than startup capitalism for inspiration has brought us in touch with unlikely, and\u00a0interesting, travelling companions.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Engage in economic exchange (but don't disrupt your hosts)</h3>\n\nBenedictine monasteries have always engaged in economic exchange with their host local communities, and there are provisions for such activities in the Rule. It works like this:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Monks must price a little lower than saeculars \u2013 doing otherwise would be avarice, a sin.</li>\n\n<li>Everything monks do must be high quality. It is work, and work is dedicated to God and leads to Him.</li>\n\n<li>Any profit you can make within these constraints is good, and you can use it to fund work that does not generate revenue.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nFather Cassian is refreshingly unapologetic\u00a0about the entrepreneurial activity of the monastery he leads. \u201cWe make a profit, and that is good.\u201d The Nursia monks brew beer (do yourself a favour and check out their <a href=\"http://youtu.be/P1hrdHtQHOg\">commercial</a> and their <a href=\"http://birranursia.com/en/blog/\">blog</a>) and run a gift shop. The beer is good. The gift shop refuses to sell cheap souvenirs, though it would be profitable.\n\nSelling high quality stuff for below market price might not seem a promising business strategy, but historically monasteries have been economically successful. \u201cWe tend to get prosperous \u2013 shrugs Father Cassian \u2013 Because monks work hard.\u201d And according to Nicola, the monks chose to brew beer because no one else in Nursia is making it. This means they are not in direct competition with anyone in the local community.\u00a0\n\nThe unMonastery prototype was nowhere near as successful. But it did strive to engage the local community in Matera in a number of ways. Self-sufficiency remains a goal. And yet, the most obvious source of revenue for the unMonasterians in Matera \u2013 teaching English \u2013 was discarded in order to not disrupt the business of Materans who earn their living by doing just that.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Strive for self-sufficiency</h3>\n\nNo brainer. The Rule recommends for monks to eat what they grow with their own hands. It is not just a metaphor either: the monks in Nursia are building a farm. UnMonasterians have been looking out for scraps of land to turn into vegetable gardens and orchards; they try to upcycle and recycle and be as frugal as possible. The best path to sustainability is not revenue generation, but cost reduction.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Be a network</h3>\n\nBenedictine monasteries are autonomous entities, but they do federate and coordinate into congregations. These supply certain important services: abbotts visit each other to check that the work being done stays on track (\u201cyou can think of it as quality control\u201d), and make themselves available to give counsel to their peers that are having a hard time and feel lonely. The unMonastery, too, was conceived to be a network of spaces; only the one in Matera has seen the light so far, but the founding group is trying hard to make it into many.\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">Where we don't converge (yet?)</h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Underwriting the model: God vs. humanism</h3>\n\nTo monks, the lynchpin of this architecture is the belief in, and love of, God. All they do is to praise and serve Him. Monastic life may seem like a desirable model to us saeculars, but Father Cassian does not think we could achieve it and maintain it in the long run. Life in the monastery, the closeness to the community, the pleasure taken in doing good work contribute towards stabilising the monk's life and helping him stay his course; but that life is still hard, and requires iron discipline. Religion underwrites all that extra effort with heavenly rewards. Take them away and individuals will waver and fail the Rule; without the Rule, the whole community will come undone.\n\nunMonasterians don't enjoy this advantage. Individual unMonasterians can be religious, but that is no lynchpin to the community. The unMonastery has no metaphysical heat sink to absorb frustration, conflict, precarity. \u201cIf you have no God, what would you work for?\u201d asked Father Cassian. Each other, maybe; or the pleasure of stewardship, of leaving Planet Earth a better place than you have found it. Father Cassian does not think those answer will be enough in the long run. Ben candidly acknowledged it: \u201cNot having God is a problem\u201d.\n\nIt's not like unMonasterians have a choice. I doubt they can simply decide to believe in God. They will have to try, keeping their eyes on some higher goal that they think is worth dedicating their lives to, or simply go home. I think they will decide to try.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Long-term thinking vs. <em>very</em> long-term thinking</h3>\n\nunMonasterians are proud of their long-term outlook on things (\u201cwe are building an institution for the next 200 years\u201d). But Father Cassian and his brethren are standing on an intimidating 1500 years-long organisational memory. We simply cannot process the time scale at which monks think. Father Cassian regards the changes introduced in monastic life by the Second Vatican Council as an ongoing experiment, a sort of prototype; reverting to celebrating Mass in Latin in a mere 60 years is probably a Benedictine's idea of failing fast. Should someone come up with 200 years of solid data suggesting that a simple move would be extremely beneficial to the Order, the Abbott Primate would probably say something like \u201cNice analysis, Brother, let's give it another couple of centuries just to be sure it's not a temporary fluctuation.\u201d We are completely outmatched here!\u00a0\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Documentation vs. no documentation</h3>\n\nThis was a surprise: for all the open source logic of Benedict's Rule and the whole Benedictine movement, monks appear not to keep documentation of what they do. When the Nursia crew decided to start their brewery, they simply dispatched <a href=\"http://birranursia.com/birrificio/storia/\">Brother Francis</a> to a monastery in Belgium that makes good beer, and told him to come back a master brewer. I am not saying a wiki would have been a good substitute for that, but I <em>am</em> saying that shared up-to-date online documentation would be a nice resource for brethren trying to get the CO2 content or the fermentation speed just right.\n\nAfter the meeting, Ben mused that monks would be perfect contributors to open source projects: patient, dedicated, generous. Teaching the use of wikis and issue trackers is one of the few areas in which unMonasterians could give something back to Benedictines.\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">What's next?</h2>\n\nThe Rnext video has made an impact. Several people have independently shown it to nuns and monks around the country. We have received several invitations besides the one in Nursia. At least one oblate has visited the unMonastery \u2013 he, too, left with a standing invitation. The Nursia meeting has been enlightening. Could we build a relationship with the monastic movement? We clearly have much to learn from such a relationship. But why would the Benedictines talk to us? What do we have to teach in exchange?\n\nFor now, I am committing these words to this blog, together with our deepest gratitude to Father Cassian for taking time to answer our questions, and to Nicola for his wonderful hospitality. Monastery vs. UnMonastery felt a bit like going for a morning jog\u00a0with Usain Bolt. We are not going to forget it any time soon.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-09-15 20:19:52", "updated_at": "2017-10-02 08:29:44.124916", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 3051, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 601.2, "like_count": 8, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [97, 1450, 212, 3, 5, 8, 2328, 51], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32370, "user_id": 2566, "topic_id": 4450, "post_number": 32, "raw": "Yes, these guys are Mahatat and have been organising other events before, such as Pantomime in the Cairo Metro etc. <a href=\"/u/iriedawta\">@Iriedawta</a>\u00a0Very cool\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-27 10:45:34", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:57.877967", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 38, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2201], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2421, "user_id": 9, "topic_id": 2388, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<span>\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7f186104ef758d55fd222b1f02971c2aea30e27b.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"413\">\n\n<strong>un\u00b7Mon\u00b7as\u00b7ter\u00b7y</strong></span><span>  (un-m\u014fn\u2032\u0259-st\u0115r\u2032\u0113)</span>\n\n<span>n. pl. un\u00b7mon\u00b7as\u00b7ter\u00b7ies</span>\n\n<strong>1. </strong><span>The place in which we gather.</span>\n\n<strong>2. </strong><span>A group that comes together to collaborate on shared social challenges.</span>\n\n<strong>3. </strong><span>A project that is redefined in each iteration by its participants, context and it\u2019s outcomes.</span>\n\n<strong>4. </strong><span>The beginning of something different.</span>\n\n<span>In recent months we\u2019ve come to define the unMonastery as a place in which we gather and today we have gathered in Matera - and so for the first time we can say together that the unMonastery has finally arrived.</span>\n\n<span><span>\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9dc01d2de50a4f822502541188db3f2113c78f62.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"413\"><br>\n\nThis is a tricky post to write; it\u2019s hard to know exactly what to say in this moment, near 596 days have passed since the initial conversation which has brought us to Matera - yet it\u2019s clear we have barely begun. In the lead up to this special occasion there are many people who have contributed to shaping, adjusting and building the unMonastery as it currently stands today. We\u2019d like to thank you eternally for your labour and passion, without it the project would most likely have remained just a fleeting conversation among friends and strangers at \\#LOTE1.<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\nBut today it is very real and with reality comes varying degrees of </span><a href=\"http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/snagging\"><span>snagging</span></a><span>.<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\nI arrived on Wednesday of this week with [</span></span>La_Gaia<span><span>], shortly followed by [elf pavlik], [</span></span>katalin<span><span>], [marc] and [cristiano siri], we will be joined soon by [Bembo Davies], [Kei] and in the coming weeks </span><a href=\"/t/announcing-team-unmonastery/2349\"><span>many more</span></a><span>. So far there has been little time for reflection and unfortunately less time for posts, but give us a week to ground ourselves and find our feet and these shall come.<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\nOur time here so far has been consumed primarily with ironing out the bugs in the administrative and financial processes to ensure the smooth day-to-day running of the unMonastery and it\u2019s relationship to MT2019. In addition to these bugs we\u2019ve been establishing crucial dates, such as the opening of the building (set for the 14th and 15th of this month, book tickets now), when the funds will be transferred, the initial connections we should make, and how/when elements of the project will be shared. Most importantly we\u2019ve been spending time getting to know one another and beginning the discussion of exactly what it is we will do here together.</span></span>\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span><span>The question that looms most prominently for us right now though, is; \u201cWhen will the heating in the building be switched on?\u201d.<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\nWhat might seem like a crisis has in fact been little more than a minor inconvenience, as it has given us the space to work, practice our Italian, ask ourselves fundamental questions about how we should organise together and what our collective aims might be. We\u2019ve been gathering at a variety of locations and we are immensely grateful to our hosts, principally Casa Netural ([</span></span>andreapaoletti<span><span>]) and the un-unMonastery (AKA le Monacelle). Tomorrow is set to be the day when the heating system comes to life and we can begin to furnish the building with our presence. </span></span>\n\n \n\n<span><span>We are deeply appreciative of [Rita O], MIMERS [</span></span>antonioelettrico<span><span>] and MT2019 who have been working tirelessly over the past months to bring the building into use and since arriving we\u2019ve seen the first beds arrive, the internet installed and the appliances appear - I\u2019ve shared photos below so everyone can see that these developments are real!<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\nDespite the rain and the nomadic nature of our stay in Matera so far we are in high spirits, we have already begun to take time with Cristiano\u2019s skilled facilitation to consider the daily rituals of the project - and the  collaborations we\u2019ve started mark the first steps towards forming an internal working structure for the project.<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\nOn the ground there is much for us to do and for the coming week the building will be our main concern but beyond utilities; we need to find food, build a new website (to accommodate our projects), rationalise our sleeping patterns, establish an evaluation model, collate together the story so far, help brew a twitterstorm and much much more.</span></span>\n\n \n\n<span><span>But whilst we wrestle with the infrastructure, the more global side of the unMonastery project has been hard at work and if you\u2019d like to lend a helping handing, these are some good starting points: </span></span>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t<span><a href=\"/t/che-fare-unmonastery-matera/552/sustainability-plan-first-iteration\"><span>From business plan to sustainability plan</span></a><span> - [Alberto] has seized upon the inappropriate nature of a business plan for the unMonastery and has made the first move to take us in a new direction. </span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t<span><a href=\"/t/che-fare-unmonastery-matera/552\"><span>CheFare</span></a><span> - @ilariadauria has been pulling together a plan for our shortlisting in CheFare and we can do with all the support possible on social media and with creating content. </span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t<span><a href=\"/t/open-source-solar-tracker/355/unbrother-sun-powering-the-unmonastery-with-solar\"><span>unBrother Sun</span></a><span> - Help by sharing your knowledge of renewable energy sources with [marc] and others so that we can reduce the energy cost of the unMonastery and produce our own.

These \u201crainforests of the sea\u201d are some of the most diverse ecosystems on earth. They flourish in ocean waters that provide few nutrients. What makes coral reefs especially interesting as a model are two attributes:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>They are held together by a simple physical structure that can be produced by colonies of tiny animals.</li>\n\n<li>Even though they only occupy 0.1 % of the world\u2019s ocean surface they provide a home for at least 25% of all marine species</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nUsing these beautiful and fragile structures as a model, The OpenVillage is a working and living space embedded in a massive online conversation equipped with collective sensemaking tools. Members are part of a global 4000+ strong community of brilliant individuals working in different fields. OpenVillage is where we pool resources to\u00a0finance a number of services which help each individual and initiative to live up to their full potential:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Foster maximal diversity to attack systemic problems</strong>.

It\u2019s microcosm. Everything that\u2019s in the outer world is there \u2013 marginalisation, addiction, poverty, sexual issues, power. Communities are just fractals of society.\u2019 The difference for Sutherland was that in Findhorn there was good will and a clear commitment to waking up: \u2018People are willing to look at their stuff.\u2019 \"People are willing to look at their stuff.\" \u00a0No matter how you say it, get this working and you can go on and on. \u00a0Avoid it, and, well, vaya con dios..bad vibes await you.</li>\n\n<li>\t\u00a0Factionalism: Inevitable perhaps to some degree, but can and should be diffused with regular\u00a0open and honest talk about it. \u00a0Requires total fidelity to truth, even if the truth is somene admitting that they are conveying an impression and not facts per se. \u00a0The thing is, frank talk should not get put off too long or too often so that bringing up anything turns into some huge blowout deal.</li>\n\n<li>\t\u00a0Founder problems: leaders and founders don't easily relinquish. \u00a0Every situation is different. \u00a0In a \"does the work/calls the shots\" environment this won't present itself as a huge problem as long as everyone understands and agrees on\u00a0the meaning of the word\u00a0\"work\" and what work has what relative value.</li>\n\n<li>\t\u00a0 \u00a0Reputation management: can be a problem as an attractor of new people. \u00a0One of the agreements of the operation should be \"don't be an asshole\" plus make sure the plumbing works and the reputation ought to take care of itself.</li>\n\n<li>\t8. Skills shortage: this has been discussed already in terms of having a variety of people clustered who know how to synergize what they know. \u00a0But if you go out to the country, this will become a big deal right away. \u00a0Unless you want to spend your time learning country skills. \u00a0But in the city the skill sets are going to be more focused on the ER mission as it plays out now, right? \u00a0Grant writing, business management, event planning, workshop managing, etc.\n\n9. Failure to attract new talent or entice subsequent generations: not a near term issue at all. \u00a0But one problem with groups is they can get pretty smug and insular. \u00a0That's not attractive.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\">\u00a0</h2>\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\">What are the most important differences between Memberships?</h2>\n\nDepending on which package they choose, Members have access to 1) \u00a0different kinds of services and 2) physical spaces.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">1) Access to services</h3>\n\n<strong>Core Membership Package: Personal and professional development</strong>\n\nYou get:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Sales and PR support</li>\n\n<li>Use of coworking spaces</li>\n\n<li>Invitation to all social events\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Invitation to annual members' retreat</li>\n\n<li>Peer coaching &amp; mentorship sessions</li>\n\n<li>Community dinners, parties, courses and adventures</li>\n\n<li>Project-development\u00a0and partnership-building support</li>\n\n<li>Invitation to participate in Skill Development Masterclasses\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nWhy do it:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Insurance against myopia ( breaking out of filterbubbles)</li>\n\n<li>Access to observations from the global network in your field</li>\n\n<li>Collective intelligence-powered insights</li>\n\n<li>Deep understanding of unconventional solutions to known and unknown problems</li>\n\n<li>Direct access to the protagonists and solutions at an early stage</li>\n\n<li>Discover important weak signals from the edges embedded in contextual knowledge (rich data)</li>\n\n<li>Contribute towards achieving positive change at scale</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>Workplace Membership Package: Space to work and business development</strong>\n\nYou get:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>PR, Sales &amp; Lobbying support</li>\n\n<li>Unlimited use of coworking space\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Invitation to annual members' retreat\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Peer coaching &amp; mentorship sessions</li>\n\n<li>Use of meeting rooms and workshop spaces</li>\n\n<li>Project development &amp; partnership-building support</li>\n\n<li>Invitation to participate in \u00a0Skill Development Masterclasses</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nWhy do it:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" class=\"noclass\">\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td><strong>Coworking Space</strong></td>\n\n<td><strong>Office</strong></td>\n\n<td><strong>Meeting Room</strong></td>\n\n<td><strong>Event Space</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td>5 sqm/person</td>\n\n<td>15 sqm</td>\n\n<td>30 sqm</td>\n\n<td>100 sqm</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td>A days/month</td>\n\n<td>B days/month</td>\n\n<td>C hours/ month</td>\n\n<td>D days/year</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n<em>+ x Eur/month for an extra person , + y Eur/month for business services</em>\n\n<strong>Resident Membership Package: Affordable housing in beautiful and respectful community</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\tBed(room) + amenities</li>\n\n<li>Comfortable, clean and calm</li>\n\n<li>High quality, healthy meals daily</li>\n\n<li>Mix of spaces for sociality &amp; solitude</li>\n\n<li>Access to our co-working and event spaces</li>\n\n<li>Community dinners, parties, courses and adventures</li>\n\n<li>Use of the \u00a0guest rooms for hosting visiting friends/family</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" class=\"noclass\" style=\"font-size: 16px;\">\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td><strong>Bed in Bunk Room</strong></td>\n\n<td><strong>Single Room</strong></td>\n\n<td><strong>Double Room</strong></td>\n\n<td>Residence</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td>10 sqm/person</td>\n\n<td>20 sqm/person</td>\n\n<td>30 sqm/person</td>\n\n<td>40 sqm/person</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td>\u00a0Eur/Person</td>\n\n<td>?

I promised to write an outline of the article in English for you, so here it is. Keep in mind that this is only a brief outline, not a translation of the article, I don't really feel qualified to do that. Also, I had to do a lot of explaining, since it was supposed to be for a wider audience so most of what I said here, you already know. ;)\n\nThanks for letting me a part of this for a couple of days, I had a very interesting time in Matera!\u00a0\n\nTheresia\n\n\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Stewardship is a term that has room for interpretaion. Explanations of the participants range from \u201ctaking care of resources together \u2013 for a common purpose\u201d to \u201cThe activation of a peer-to-peer (or in this case, citizen-to-citizen) network, that makes it possible for a community to take care of itself.\u201d</li>\n\n<li>The unMonastery could count as a concrete example of stewardship.\n\nMateras bid for European capital 2019 makes it an ideal candidate for hosting a tech-utopian model: A group of people takes care of and lives in an unused building and at the same time works on projects that are supposed to serve the interests of the municipality \u2013 with nothing but code, good-will and skills.</li>\n\n<li>The history of the unMonastery is short, but a little confusing. Edgeryders was founded in 2011 with money from the European Commission. The Think Tank was supposed to operate online and through a series of conferences and be open to all. The goal was to create a report outside of an institutional framework that would give EU-politicians insight into reality of young Europeans.</li>\n\n<li>\u201cThe Edgeryders Guide to the Future\u201d was published in 2012, which is also when the second conference took place in Brussels. Edgeryders decided to push forward, even though the EU funding ended. Part of the motivation for doing so was the idea that was conceived in Strasbourg: the unMonastery.</li>\n\n<li>The name wasn\u2019t chosen at random. The history of monasteries, with breweries, gardens, prayer and scripture was a fitting parallel.</li>\n\n<li>How to bring that model in the 21<sup>st</sup> century? The answer lies in the \u201cun\u201d: Religion, hierarchy and gender barriers are supposed to be replaced by a focus on accessibility, documentation and transparency.</li>\n\n<li>Another inspiration were hackerspaces, even though \u201cthey don\u2019t necessarily have a social contract with the communities that surround them\u201d (Ben)</li>\n\n<li>Twelve \u201cchallenges\u201d were developed in talks with the Materans that were supposed to form the basis for the work the unMonks would do in the next months. The idea of replicating the project and creating a European network of unMonasteries was central.</li>\n\n<li>The modesty of the proposals is intentional and maybe a sign that idealism has become more pragmatic since the time of the communes in the 1960s. The comparison is so obvious that some joked the unMonastery is like a commune but with the internet.</li>\n\n<li>Even though there is this self-awareness, the pitfalls are the same: Coming from the outside and \u201cgiving\u201d people political agency (the german word I used here is \u201cSelbstbestimmung\u201d, self-determination maybe) might be oxymoronic. Matera is a place were people have been forced to take care of themselves for decades. In his 1945 book \u201cChrist Stopped at Eboli\u201d, the Italian author Carlo Levi described the area as a world \u201chedged in by custom and sorrow, cut off from History and the State, eternally patient\u201d, a land \u201cwithout comfort or solace, where the peasant lives out his motionless civilization on barren ground in remote poverty, and in the presence of death.\u201d</li>\n\n<li>By the 1950s, the sassi had become a slum area and were \u201cevacuated\u201d by the government. It was only at the end of the 1980s that the city realized the touristic potential and began renovation. Since 1993 the sassi are a UNESCO world heritage site. In October 2014 the European Commission announced that Matera had won the bid for European capital of culture. Interest from the outside is probably going to increase over the next years.</li>\n\n<li>LOTE \\#4 was partly a review and an outlook for the unMonastery. One of the sessions invited locals to share their view of the project. One of them said: \u201cWe were told these Americans would come and solve our problems in three months. Basically, we were expecting superheroes.\u201d Apparently, the unMonastery couldn\u2019t fulfill the high expectations. The enthusiasm that I felt during the conference felt a little dampened that day.</li>\n\n<li>If you believe in open source, though, you also believe that mistakes are unavoidable and that they have to be documented, so that the wider community can work on tweaking and improving the process. For somebody who is new to the topic, the focus on documentation can seem a little excessive. The unMonastery has transparent finances, the sessions were documented on a hackpad and there is a wiki listing all possible information \u2013 from \u201cdaily rituals\u201d to the \u201cpolitical climate\u201d. This is commendable, but the risk is that big amounts of documents are piling up online \u2013 without being contextualized or (maybe) even read.</li>\n\n<li>The other risk is that this kind of documentation is very time intensive. In another session looking back on the unMonastery, we learn that the weekly dinners that were popular with the people of Matera had to be sacrificed for an information session for the wider Edgeryders community.</li>\n\n<li>It feels a little strange sitting in the caves of this old city and hearing about projects that have no connection to the place. It still is interesting to hear Vinay Gupta talk about the hexayurts. Or Helen Kaplinsky about Islington Mill.

The gap between the growing demand and the shrinking offer of care is the basis of the present care crisis. To overcome this crisis a brand-new care systems has to be imagined and enhanced. It is possible to imagine communities of care and their socio-technical enabling ecosystems, capable to sustain and coordinate people\u2019s caring and collaborating capabilities and doing so, creating new forms of care-related communities.\n\nThis process exacerbates in those areas of the city that suffer sudden transformations and even more where a large chunk of the city change its function.\n\nThis was the case of Bovisa district in Milan that undergone a dramatic change in the 90s\u2019 when the dismissed industrial area (Ex-gasometri) left place to the current Bovisa Politecnico University. In the words of one of the professor at Politecnico \u201cit\u2019s like if a massive alien spacecraft has unexpectedly landed\u201d.\n\nThis is considered a general upgrading of the district but no doubt resulted in a subsequent change in the social life.\n\nThe newly established School of Design attracted some 4,000 students which increased the demand for daily, standard, low cost services. That is what today Bovisa offers for the most, since the majority of the students live somewhere else. When students are off the district it changes its face: bookshops, fast food, bars, copy centres are closed and leave the district lifeless.\n\nThere are good practices for people aggregation like the local weekly street market, the cultural association Scighera, the social initiative Coltivando or the multiservice caf\u00e8 Mamusca, but students show little interactions with it. It seems a missed opportunity.\n\nThe aforementioned pushed the Politecnico University to challange itself asking \u201chow can our student transitional community and residents develop positive interactions and give new life to the district?\u201d.\n\nThis is what the course \u2013 <em>PSSD 2017 Networks of Care Collaborative encounters in/around the Bovisa campus</em> \u2013 is about.\n\nEzio Manzini and Liat Rogel, with Susanna De Besi wanted this to be the focus of their students\u2019 work for this year. And they suggested the students to interact with the edgeryders community as their works progress.\n\nToday introduction ended with the following questions to students:\n\n<strong>Referring to your everyday interactions with Bovisa, when are you in need for care? \u00a0And when are you willing to provide care to somebody else?</strong>\n\n@Ezio_Manzini @Social_Open_Campus @Rossana_Torri @Liat @Social_Open_Campus\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-08 15:35:01", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 04:49:50.181068", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 455, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 26.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1657, "user_id": 95, "topic_id": 1624, "post_number": 1, "raw": "My first mission, and it's not a typical one: I offered a session on spirituality and resilience at the Edgecamp Unconference, and by request I'm putting up some quick notes/summary for those that attended, and those that didn't.\n\nWe started with a simple mindfulness of breathing exercise and I began by proposing a working definition of spirituality for the purposes of Edgeryders (a fuller definition is impossible in this context). The definition is 'practices and structures for transformations of consciousness'. In the Edgeryders context, this means developing equanimity to avoid reacting to external stimuli: consumerist materialism, the domination system/ neoliberal growth economics etc. This stimulated a discussion on advertising and marketing, and the ubiquity of symbolism of death and sex- eros and thanatos- something designed into marketing since its inception by the nephew of Sigmund Freud, Edward de Bernays (Adam Curtis has a great series on these ideas called 'Century of the Self: view the first episode here: <a href=\"http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=9167657690296627941\">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=9167657690296627941</a>\n\nArthur talked about Alain de Botton's ideas of atheism and science learning from the valuable elements of traditional religion: community, ritual, meaning and gathering etc. see this link for a critical take on de Botton's ideas: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/jan/12/religion-for-atheists-de-botton-review\">http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/jan/12/religion-for-atheists-de-botton-review</a>\n\nNadia, with a background in advertising and cognitive science, challenged the idea of much traditional religious practice and queried the purpose of this transformation. I suggested that this is a case of Stephen Jay Gould's 'non-overlapping magisteria <a href=\"http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_noma.html\">http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_noma.html</a> . I define consciousness change as separate, but connected to religious heritage. it's an injunction: perform the practice, analyse the result. Effectively, a scientific method.\n\nRecommendations were made for the work of Peter Senge, specifically his Theory U\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.ottoscharmer.com/publications/summaries.php\">http://www.ottoscharmer.com/publications/summaries.php</a> and also Don Beck's work on Spiral Dynamics (I'm not really into SD any more, as I think it's reductionist and pseudoscientific, preferring other developmental theorists that are a bit more evidence-based, eg Robert Kegan's work at Harvard).\n\nTime was against us, so l left with the proposal that Edgeryders is a community of practice, and that transformation of consciousness can be a component of its development. I recommended new movements of peer-to-peer spiritual practice, including Pragmatic Buddhism\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.pragmaticbuddhism.org/\">http://www.pragmaticbuddhism.org/</a> , Daniel Ingram's work on 'Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha' <a href=\"http://www.interactivebuddha.com/mctb.shtml\">http://www.interactivebuddha.com/mctb.shtml</a> or... whatever practice or community you choose.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFeel free to comment and continue the discussion.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt's been great to meet fellow Edgeryders and also test my own resilience and urban survival ability, having had my wallet lost or stolen and being without money or accomodation for the first day! Looking forward to the rest of the Unconference. I'm in Arthur Doohan's 'state in a box' session now, and I want to turn my attention to it now, so signing off...\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-16 13:59:14", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 13:25:27.812246", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 591, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 15.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22731, "user_id": 781, "topic_id": 1408, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>divergent thinking</b>\n\n\u00a0\n\nThanks J\n\nI think is a good tool to create new realities and reinvent the world.

It is a participant built event\u00a0dedicated to bringing together existing projects into a demo of a new health and social care system powered by open source, community-driven solutions (\"opencare\").\u00a0We are interested in what our peers already already are doing in different parts of the world, and what we can do together.\u00a0\n\nAre you interested in how to build healthy organisations, communities or healthy societies humming with human flourishing?\u00a0Perhaps you might like to join us?\n\nLearn more about Gehan's work and how you could\u00a0<a href=\"/t/theme-session-proposal-architectures-of-love-policy-vs-culture-in-creating-the-conditions-for-opencare/6271\">get involved in the OpenVillage Festival here</a>.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<em>Image Credit: <a href=\"https://www.scottishfield.co.uk/content_block/front-page-1/galgael-15-farlie-street-glasgow-g51-2sn/\">Scottish Field</a></em>\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-23 13:12:18", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:37.010608", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 360, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 76.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3729], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23218, "user_id": 105, "topic_id": 3992, "post_number": 14, "raw": "<b>Amen!</b>\n\nI said at least 3 times that I just want to discuss it here out in open and simply invite Edgeryders to engage without any expectations.

And so what we are trying do we try to understand how the future enters into our thinking and that\u2019s the idea of using the future.\u00a0 <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/105580898\">00:04-00:54</a>\n\nTo use the future is to use a time in a place that doesn\u2019t exist yet. And that allows you freedom to talk about things in a different way than you can do if you are talking about in the present. <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/105580897\">00:04- 00:16</a>\n\nIn Ghana we are getting a group of people together every month- creatives, thinkers, lawyers, architects, artists, musicians\u2026anybody who\u2019s creative by nature. And we\u2019re getting them together to think about, to explore what\u2019s happening on the ground , how are people imagining or reimagining our culture, our art, our buildings with a particular purpose in mind: we know that Africa is going to almost double in the next 20 years. It will be the youngest continent in the world, and no one has thought through, at least no one that we can see, how to address both this opportunity and some people would call it a challenge of massive explosive growth in a very short period of time and particularly growth that\u2019s gonna be urbanized. So this means that anybody who can think creatively out of the box, who can imagine something that\u2019s never been seen before and come up with creative solutions to address this we wanna give these people room, we wanna encourage people. So that\u2019s something we\u2019re doing right now on the ground. We are literally banding together, we\u2019ve been doing this literally for years and so there\u2019s a collective of thinkers coming together to divine what\u2019s possible given these opportunities/challenges that we\u2019re going to be facing. It\u2019s very exciting! \u00a0<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/106141722\">00:37- 02:05</a>\n\nWe have seen the future [used in many differen ways]... I was on a team that went to Myanmmar, or Burma, and we put together the Myanmmar futures exchange which was at the time the largest and actually the first foresight event to get people together and to give them tools to think about the future. Now when we say tools to think about the future it\u2019s really enhancing the way we think about the future so we talk about future\u2019s literacy, future\u2019s thinking. And what we found in those contexts was that it really allowed to have new conversations, it allowed them to challenge the existing norms. In a place like myanmmar Burma you have all sorts of norms related to elders so initially if you have a conversation the older would speak and everybody else would listen. But the tools and exercises that we used and created allowed for more collaborative , more participatory means that examining things that are happening today and also the future context. <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/106141720\">00: 51-01:52</a>\n\nWe worked with an open engagement group called social life but also with technology and engineering companies like Arup our, and also with some scientific fiction authors to imagine different kinds of londoners in decade\u2019s time, so in ten years time. We thought not just about londoners who are hi flying businessmen and women, but also about londoners who really care about the city, that want to create new kinds of communities, and finally we talked about londoners who could really be suffering in the future, so people who work in vary unstable jobs, who is having to hack the public transport, access cards in order to travel around. \u00a0in order to afford to travel around the city you need to have a much better job that the one they have. So we talked about very different kind of londoners, people who embodied very different kinds of trends and we didn\u2019t just create this in presence to \u00a0policy makers. We actually had a double page ad in one of the national newspapers in the UK and a four page ad in the London newspaper so we directed a campaign about this future London a policy makers which required to respond. So we use the future as part of the campaign, we didn\u2019t just use it to do an exercise, we publish in a journal, or in a paper, in a corner, somewhere, and we were very noisy about the future. And I think that really helps the people in difficult situation to think about the future that they want and not about the future that London\u2019s assembly or politicians want. <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/105580897\">01:00 - 02:32</a>\n\nI was really very privileged and lucky to work on two cases: Nairobi and Chennai, where the job was deliver scenarios for how these cities could look very different or could have different futures and in given to those futures one of the decision that people in the informal sector could take to empower themselves. So people in the informal sector are very often at the mercy of the large economic forces or even well meaning forces. One to regulate things to trying shift the economy in a certain way and if you are in the informal sector that\u2019s your livelihood and it\u2019s your survival. And the project was not just about generating scenarios about how things could be different, it was very much structured around: what if you got these scenarios and you experience what the life could be like, what do you do then and on the basis of that generating ideas and actually prototyping and showing ideas, building ideas, materially, of how to improve lives given this incredible constrain of being poor being in the informal sector, being outside of the regular system. <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/106062450\">02:06-03:32</a>\n\nUsing the future in crisis situations help actually to deal with crisis, deals with difficult situation. So imagine that what I\u2019m talking about that in fact even in this crisis situation there are opportunities they open up, when this crisis situation come a lot of time because they will sometime in the future, they will sometime in the future. What is reality today what is actual point in the future. So therefore what we do today actually shapes the future. How do you think of using the future in the present is to say: What I think today what I do today. As allowed to do with how the future is going to be. That may be on a very small scale of individuals and that we\u2019re talking about or we can talk about groups, we can talk about countries, we can talk about humanities. But how you deal with this situation is a story that you tell, yes. How do you place the crisis that you are now facing in history, in your story. How does your story it does? If you\u2019re in your story, \u00a0of the past into the present and going to the future and catastrophy is what you see, this current situation, in my estimation, is going to lead only to catastrophy. It can hardly see something good coming out of it. It\u2019s an honour for you to be able to see the opportunity of change. <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/106003309\">04:53-</a>\n\nSo what happens when you are stressed or in difficulty... in a way you can strengthen people, you can build up resilience in your society by providing people tools to acknowledge that the first reaction is fear, that there are other possibilities and that they can, by taking a step back, and using future thinking, allow them to have hope, to think about possibilities, and also to share these thoughts. Resilience is also about being connected with people so doing the future thinking , sharing the future images with other people will also help you to accept what is happening now and to have kind of shared dreams of better futures. <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/106224224\">01:44- 03:34</a>\n\nWhy is that concept critical for us? Because I mean, people particularly poor, vulnerable people face constant challenges, crisis and chronic stresses and resilience is a concept \u00a0to think about how can we strengthen the ability to deal with those challenges in a better way and to emerge from them more strongly and it\u2019s interesting there is actually a strong relation to using the future and future methodologies because one of the elements to think about resilience that strengthens the resilience of individuals and communities is the ability to anticipate. So anticipate broadly and then to think about how can we prepare for those events. There are other elements of resilience as well around modularity so are there/is there a way to see \u2026we see approaches for example so it\u2019s normally a decentralized approach Is better than a centralized approach in many cases because then you have elements that could step in if another one fails . but the ability to anticipate is actually also a critical element of strengthening resilience. <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/106224225\">01:30-03:02</a>\n\nConsider sometime beyond today, beyond this moment and that\u2019s the future. But all of us has implicit assumption about the future, about what is gonna happen today, what is gonna happen tomorrow, i don\u2019t know in an year or so, we have those assumptions. A lot of times if those assumptions create in our heads possible scenarios what we\u2019ve made or not. But sometimes this scenarios are almost like given, we think this is it! But on the line assumption to every scenario, every way that we think of the future they are on the line assumption. So using the future, being conscious of how you see the next day, how you envision the next day and what you anticipate, what your actions are based on some or fundamental assumptions that you have, that you may or may not be aware of. Ok using the future to me is, first of all, begin to grapple with those assumptions and those assumptions are usually hidden so the process of using the future is really making the invisible visible. <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/106003309\">00:21- 01:51</a>\n\nSo...So an example is: we were working with Greece, just before the beginning of the significant crisis and we were working on kind of thinking about the future democracy frankly that was used out but the reality was the real future, the crisis was actually only dated out so in fact the question of what is democracy didn\u2019t like matter when you basically saying: does the country even exist? <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/106062451\">01:03-01:37</a>\n\n<strong>Alternative ending 1:</strong>\n\nBecoming future literate is something that from my experience occurs when you confront, engage, quietly (like) most learning that there is something that you don\u2019t know and you say: how can I know something about something that I don\u2019t know? First you must know that you don\u2019t know! Then you can say: ah! how do I begin to understand what is it that I don\u2019t know! And so the processes that I use when I construct a future leaderacy knowledge laboratory is: I bring people together, to work together, to confront the way they use the future and what\u2019s terrific is that is very easy really, everybody thinks about the future all the time.\n\n<strong>Alternative ending 2:</strong>\n\n\"Emerging voices. People who are doing things in new and unique ways.We want you to know that there is a group of people looking at using the future, re-imagining it. Creating something to help us address our emerging opportunities and challenges. We are here in solidarity with you to....So get ready, we\u2019re coming to you. soon!\" <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/104796299\">00:25-end</a>\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nfile_fid:3679 -", "created_at": "2014-09-23 20:17:50", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:20.157021", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2191, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8640, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2283, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Win some, lose some</b>\n\nI see three problems in having network barter work as a engine for collaboration. In growing order of difficulty:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>time</strong>: if I do something, <em>when</em> do I get something else in return?</li>\n\n<li><strong>uncertainty</strong>: can I propose to barter the <em>certainty\u00a0</em>of\u00a0something against the\u00a0<em>possibility</em>\u00a0of something else?</li>\n\n<li><strong>identity</strong>: <i>who</i> am I exchanging with?\u00a0</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nI am going to look at them in the context of our example with [Sam Muirhead]'s video.\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Time. Imagine you are, let's say, [pacheca] and you spend some time translating the video's subtitles. Now you get something else in return, great! Suppose this something else is \"funded travel to the next LOTE\". That's in anything between 6 and 12 months. How does this work? You can \"trick the system\" saying\u00a0that Rita would get immediately\u00a0a\u00a0<em>voucher</em>\u00a0redeemable for some future conference, of course. Is that cheating? Notice that, seen this way \"there are no debts\" is not a feature, but a bug: debt is indeed intertemporal allocation of goods and services.</li>\n\n<li>Uncertainty. Let's follow up on the same example. We are not really sure that there will even be another LOTE \u2013 all we can say is that we are committed to do our best to making it happen. So, Rita could be compensated by a\u00a0<em>conditional\u00a0</em>voucher: \u00a0in return for her work, she gets a voucher redeemable for some future conference,\u00a0<em>if we ever manage to make one and get it funded.</em>\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Identity. This one is hard. Just let's follow the video example again. What happened:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><span>Sam decided to ask [Ben] questions and make a video of it.</span></li>\n\n<li>[LucasG] donated some of his time to open the Amara stub and do most of the transcription work (semi-automated, but still you need to know how to run the system).\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>At this point, some people including [Noemi] and myself put the word out on Edgeryders and on social media.</li>\n\n<li>Finally, a dozen generous folks did the actual translations.</li>\n\n</ul></li>\n\n</ol>\n\nIt is not clear, here, who is indebted to whom. Who are we even doing a favour? Everyone I listed is volunteering time, skills, sometimes money to build some sort of common resource, the unMonastery. So, who is supposed to be compensating us? What's more, when you are collaboratively building commons,\u00a0it's not even clear where you should\u00a0draw a line. Upstream of the video, there was LOTE3, that was build collaboratively; and upstream of that there is the unMonastery project, driven by Edgeryders but from which Edgeryders LBG has not drawn one cent. I see [elf Pavlik] smiling in my head: it's non-transactional all the way down.\u00a0\n\nI have other thoughts (not critiques, more like suggested workarounds), but I will stop here for now. This is an important decision both for Edgeryders and for the Economy App, and I would really like more people to chime in.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-12-20 19:10:00", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:40.069192", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 566, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6125, "user_id": 2464, "topic_id": 6092, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hosted by SCIMPULSE\u00a0in Geneva at CERN. @Alberto (ER), @Lakomaa (EHFF), @Rossana_Torri (Citt\u00e0 di\u00a0Milano), @Costantino (WeMake)\u00a0please react if it is not the case; consult with people from your organization who will actually attend.\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\">Agenda</h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">March 13th</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>15:00 \u2013 18:00 <strong>Consortium meeting (research team only).</strong> Debriefing after the mid-term review\u00a0and planning OpenCare next steps.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">March 14th (*** all open sessions, if needed, they\u00a0can happen in parrallel)\u00a0</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>9:30 \u2013 13:30 <strong>Participatory user testing\u00a0to upgrade\u00a0the OpenCare SSNA dashboard </strong><em>[TBA\u00a0what can be done onsite, realistically]</em>\u00a0NB: The GraphRyder dashboard can be accessed\u00a0<a href=\"http://164.132.58.138:9000/#/dashboard/globalView\">here</a>.

What did end up happening is that while several community members showed interest in building EU applications when set up the <a href=\"/t/horizon-2020-collaborator/347\">Horizon 2020 Collaborator</a>, even where \\#3 was sparked by conversations in the community, the actual heavy lifting in building bids ended up being done by the directors of the Edgeryders company with the <a href=\"/t/edgeryders-finally-moving-on-with-caps-application-on-care-by-hackers/4117\">community invited in again</a> once 1) and 2) had been done.\n\n<strong>The Dev team:\u00a0</strong>So far the Edgeryders <a href=\"/t/edgeryders-dev-testing/331\">Dev and Testing group</a> has been dedicated to addressing issues with the Edgeryders.eu platform. People have been using it to post information about bugs, or ask tech-related questions, and if and when we have had the resources (mainly <a href=\"/u/alberto\">@Alberto</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"/u/matthias\">@Matthias</a>). And we are heavily under-resourced, so the list of tasks that fall under \"putting out fires\" grows, while promising initiatives like project retreats (<a href=\"/t/harmonious-hackathon-builder/3910\">Harmonious Hackathons</a>) gather dust. Ideally we would use Makerfox to barter different kinds of help between community members to both keep the infrustructure running and help move individual projects forward but this requires resources to carry the cost of coordination (which is an ungrateful set of tasks people rarely are willing to shoulder without financial compensation).\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-20 07:56:05", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:39.160484", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 483, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [28818], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3450, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 3417, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/30afac6c402600cb8ff72c464b56fbe6856e25bd.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"345\"><br>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<div class=\"blog\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; word-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(66, 66, 66); font-family: Lora, Georgia, Cambria, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 25px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">\n\n<div class=\"main\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; word-wrap: break-word;\">\n\n<div class=\"lead_image\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; word-wrap: break-word;\">\n\n<h1 style=\"margin: 0px 0px 0.75em; padding: 0px; word-wrap: break-word; font-size: 2em; font-weight: 400; clear: both; font-family: Oswald, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;\">IMPROVING REALITY 2014 \u2013 VISIBILITY IS A TRAP</h1>\n\n<h3 style=\"margin: 3.5em 0px 2.2em; padding: 0px; word-wrap: break-word; font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: 400; clear: both; font-family: Oswald, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 1.2;\">BRIGHTON DIGITAL FESTIVAL</h3>\n\n</div>\n\n<hr style=\"clear: both; float: none; width: 800px; height: 1px; margin: 0px 0px 1.42em; border: none; background-color: rgb(221, 221, 221); color: rgb(221, 221, 221); background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;\">\n\n<h3 style=\"margin: 3.5em 0px 2.2em; padding: 0px; word-wrap: break-word; font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: 400; clear: both; font-family: Oswald, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 1.2;\">4 September 2014\n\nStudio Theatre, Brighton\u00a0</h3>\n\nEvent hashtag: \\#ireality\n\n<hr style=\"clear: both; float: none; width: 800px; height: 1px; margin: 0px 0px 1.42em; border: none; background-color: rgb(221, 221, 221); color: rgb(221, 221, 221); background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;\">\n\n<h3 style=\"margin: 3.5em 0px 2.2em; padding: 0px; word-wrap: break-word; font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: 400; clear: both; font-family: Oswald, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 1.2;\">HOW ARE ARTISTS, DESIGNERS, AND CRITICAL THINKERS ADDRESSING THE NATURE OF NOW?</h3>\n\n<hr style=\"clear: both; float: none; width: 800px; height: 1px; margin: 0px 0px 1.42em; border: none; background-color: rgb(221, 221, 221); color: rgb(221, 221, 221); background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;\">\n\n<blockquote style=\"margin: 1.5em 0px; padding: 2em; word-wrap: break-word; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.8; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);\">\n\nLighthouse\u2019s thought-provoking conference of contemporary culture, Improving Reality, returns this September for a spectacular fourth edition.\n\nImproving Reality is a one-day conference that brings together an international community of artists, thinkers and makers to share and experience groundbreaking art and ideas of the present.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\nThis year\u2019s theme is<em style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; word-wrap: break-word;\">Visibility is a Trap</em>.

That would be great, if not for the fact that arts orgs \u2013 especially in smaller cities \u2013 can be inward-looking and parochial. They tend to see ECOC as a way to get more lavish funding for their business-as-usual activities rather than as a chance to grow, internationalise, and regenerate. They may move to secure what they perceive as \"their turf\" by excluding others.\u00a0\n\nThis is where politics moves in. When everything works well, established arts orgs are assured that their pet projects are to be absolutely central in the bid book. Next, they are told that many \"new kids\" are going to have to be on board if the city is to win the title. The context is of increasing financial resources, so there is no direct competition for funding between the existing orgs' activities and the new stuff that is being brought in.\u00a0\n\nIn other words, the ECOC competition is framed as a positive-sum game. This was done successfully in the case of Matera. Unfortunately, once the title is won, it becomes much harder to prevent stakeholders from seeing a cake that needs to be split, and splitting a cake is very much a zero-sum game. That's when they could be tempted to use their stakes as weapons against each other...\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-02-08 19:00:55", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:19.204111", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 248, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2580], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29127, "user_id": 2823, "topic_id": 5025, "post_number": 8, "raw": "Hello everyone!\n\nThanks, Noemi, for the invitation.

However once we\u2019d departed it was difficult to stay in touch, to coordinate, collaborate and balance our other lives with the potential we saw in the future of EdgeRyders.\n\nThis session focused on the high speed mapping of roles, skills and network reach - so we can better identify the real potential of the community and to make the connections with each other necessary in realising that potential. It was followed up by pooling the goals, competencies and challenges from a community perspective on how the EdgeRyders\u2019 membership and platform might become capable of delivering for those participating and the greater goals of the project. Drawing from the roles and skills identified in the first part of the day, we used <a href=\"http://www.methodkit.com/\">Methodkit</a>, a tool developed by community member Ola M\u00f6ller, to create a clearer picture.\n\n<div class=\"mceTemp\">\u00a0</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"mceTemp\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>What came out of this track?</strong></h2>\n\n<h2 class=\"mceTemp\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"unmonastery.eu/TEST\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6d18b6f75d650dbb8369454315c3db411084e5a0.png\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\">\n\n</a></h2>\n\nEdgeryders Asset Mapping (work in progress)\n\n<a href=\"http://piratepad.net/uGaAJAWLbC\">The Unmonastery</a> (work in progress) Copy on the Day in the Life of the <a href=\"http://twitter.com/unmonastery\" target=\"_blank\">@unmonastery</a>- feedback here please! <a href=\"http://t.co/tner4wYl\" target=\"_blank\">http://t.co/tner4wYl</a>\n\nEdgeryders Community Mapping (work in progress)\n\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A3RsSOE-FzkOrCXk8-C4qZXQbXzPfhtr8j2wvPvpZg0/edit#\">Bridging networks and building local-global collaboration</a> (model development)\n\nLinking up street level projects Challenges' infopool/coop Expedition Freedom\n\n<h1 class=\"mceTemp\"><strong>Policy Hero Challenge:</strong></h1>\n\nhttps://twitter.com/KatBorlongan/status/277069053988831233\n\n<script charset=\"utf-8\" type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script>\n\nThe Rewiring innovation policy track explored <strong>what innovation policy aimed at supporting innovative networked individuals, rather than organizations might look like</strong>. In the course of the session, Edgeryders itself was used repeatedly as an example of a network of innovative\u00a0 individuals. The main conclusion was that for accountability reasons there is a need for organisational shells that interfaces between individuals and sources of public support such as governmental funding bodies. The track split into three subsessions. The first looked at what organizational form might Edgeryders take to best support the innovative individuals participating in the network. The second identified non-monetary forms of support that institutional actors possibly could offer individuals. The third explored in more detail how resources already available within the Edgeryders network could be leveraged for mutual cooperative support. The second policy track explored <strong>how we could better go about supporting bottom-up social infrastructures that regenerate human potential</strong>. In various parts of Europe, at hyper local scales, innovative doers are prototyping groundbreaking ways that combine community spirit, peer to peer learning and economic value, while increasing resilience. Initiatives such as Incredible Edible Todmorden, the Stroud Open Gardens and Community Supported Agriculture projects in the UK or the Prinzessinnengarten in Berlin are all based on a community volunteering model: some are using donated public land as they grow (organic) food; connect with vendors to generate revenues and become self-sustainable; or campaign for the learning of food-growing in schools. Despite much talk about social innovation, policies that fosters, supports and coordinate these efforts are patchy at best. The actionable is a blueprint for latching innovative, radical initiatives resulting in social cohesion to existing public policy frameworks.\n\n<h2 class=\"mceTemp\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n\n<strong>What came out of </strong><strong>this track?</strong>\n\n</h2>\n\n<h2 class=\"mceTemp\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"/sites/edgeryders.eu/files/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/weber-011.png\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/af050e7454f8199535541e1416f62e3a405af221.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"212\">\n\n</a></h2>\n\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MB4ayjX_vWjAMVeUQNKmgJ24Z_Qi0ZGdXeutD-2931M/edit#\">Edgeryders Venture Social Capital Fund Model </a>(work in progress)\n\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_uvDH5sPsAf2VSLm6r3dVhNxQB56L8usjYcGV6LX8ao/edit#\">Proposals for Edgeryders Organisation in three cases</a>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2 scenarios: no funding &amp; little funding)\n\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VKWI4oLuvKnUG1gDvA3DiY4g_Fl2vTBvpn4IV1LnFjc/edit\">Proposals for UnMonetary support</a> (work in progress)\n\n<h1 style=\"text-align: left;\">\u00a0</h1>\n\n<h1 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Community Action Hero Challenge:</strong></h1>\n\nThe two final days were dedicated to seeing how we can collaborate to drive the community forward, making use of the huge amount of resources we have collectively.

I definitely agree with your point about limited reproducibility. I would just like to add a couple of side notes:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>On the app to reserve the soccer field: I am not sure who made the app, but here is a bet: it was a company out to make some cash. Why I think that? Because the allocation pattern of hours for the soccer field <em>worked.</em>\u00a0The only reason to fix something that is not broken (the only one I can think of,\u00a0\u00a0at least) is that the fix will generate some money. Classic tragedy of the commons type stuff, create artificial scarcity around a resource then charge for access. As <a href=\"/u/teirdes\">@teirdes</a>\u00a0pointed out at LOTE4, part of stewarding is to keep a watch on changes in the law, make sure that self-interested actors don't make a grab for rights to access and then sell you back what you had in the first place!</li>\n\n<li>I get the impression that you might have some misconceptions about people in Matera. They are not some kind of noble (or not so noble) savages out there. In my experience, they use technology (both as Facebook and as smartphones) more or less in the same proportions as everybody else in Europe, give or take a few percent (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_smartphone_penetration\">smartphone penetration by country 2013</a>).</li>\n\n<li>Language barriers are definitely there \u2013 this is Italy, after all. My interpretation of language barriers is backwards: we thought people could learn to speak a bit of Italian in the course of 4-6 months, and it did not happen (interestingly, it is mostly the anglos who seem resistant to learning by just being in the country. Marc, French, has become fluent in Italian; Juliana, hispanophone, speaks quite well).

I believe what you really need is something to keep you dry that can be easily transported. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BoPET\">BOPET</a> fits this bill, but it won't have all the comfort of real tent material. Still if you can get e.g. a few <em>rolls</em> of <a href=\"http://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/210-180cm-for-rescue-isothermal-rainproof_642907910.html\">this</a> for popualtion centers - and the rest <em>packaged</em> to be transported on foot it would probably help. Once the situation normalizes (or enough real tents arrive) the material can re-purposed in various ways. Just make sure you get decent quality (tensile strength). Not the stuff for making glitter! There is also a version with EVA (hot-glue) on one side - a small quantity (1-5%) of that could be useful for repairing damages which will definitely happen. On the other hand some kind of locally available (Kathmandu paper factory?) resin or wax may do a repair job as well. Contact the garment industry for fiber material (ropes) that you can use as strain relief to protect the film. Ideally I'd have the supplier include a little leaflet with the packaging on how you can re-purpose these things as solar concentrators for example. If my idea does not sound too crazy I'd be happy to lend a hand in fleshing out the leaflet for example. It is probably best to have a local guy who can speak Chinese contact a number of possible suppliers for starters.\n\nApart from that, if someone can give me a list of the pre/post-quake industry/manufacturing capabilities - I can try to infer what other tools there are in the \"greater toolbox\". From small scale experience I would also suggest to try and get your hands on some largish quantity of 2-component epoxy (resin+hardener), and some means of measuring volume (e.g. used syringes or larger). You can locally turn it into the kind of adhesive you need by dumping in fine fibers (cotton, paper, glass, etc.) and perhaps reinforcing it with strong larger fibers (dry natural fibers are an option for the short term, does not have to be glass or kevlar). Make sure you keep the ratios of the components (resin/hardener) right and mix the stuff well. You'll probably have to experiment a little before you get the hang of it.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-05 10:48:13", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:25.002554", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 466, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20482, "user_id": 243, "topic_id": 3873, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>\"unDojo\" calls just after the community calls every week</b>\n\nI would like to invite everyone to join the \"unDojo\" calls, after the community calls, every week, in the same space - just stay after the hangout in our online space.\n\nWhy?

I have earned my living by selling my skills both as an economist and <a href=\"http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberto_Cottica\">as a moderately successful musician</a> (in the period 1995-2000), so quite naturally I have given it quite a lot of hard thinking.\n\nMy take on the issue has been to go all the way. Yes, perhaps there should be more recognition for cultural work. Yes, it can be counterintuitive that some people are paid and other have to pay to do exactly the same activity (like performing music). But, realistically, I am not going to be able to change this. If I want to earn a living by making art or culture, I am going to have to make it work financially within the existing context, not in some ideal world. And I and my partners did so, and we walked the straight and narrow path between righteous disdain of commercial concerns - which can be creatively sterile, because art is communication, and there is no communication if people don't react to what you are doing - and outright whoring. It went well enough that we could support ourselves confortably, no frills.\n\nIn 2008 I put on my economist's hat and built up a project on the creative economy for the Italian Ministry of Economic Development. The reasoning was this: creativity, in a market economy, tends to drive at least some economic activity. The Ministry, had a lot of money to foster economic development in the lagging areas of the country (you may have heard of southern Italy historically not doing as well as the north. A natural German analogy would be the ex-DDR Laender shortly after the Vereinigung), and was dissatisfied with its own lack of impact. The funding would be captured by consultants and organizations that could deliver paperwork, but not good results: this was a function of the bureaucratic, formalistic way public expenditure administration is organized in Italy. So I said: \"Look, if we can teach creatives to put forward their ideas in a structured way they can be more effective at bidding for funding\". The result was <a href=\"http://progettokublai.ning.com\">Kublai</a>, a peer-to-peer environment for developing projects and even micro companies in the creative sector. It still exists, mostly online (last time I checked it aggregated about 3.000 creatives working on 400 projects).\n\nKublai works by encouraging creatives to put their ideas in written form, answering all of the hard questions that you need to address in a well-written business plan. Why do we need this? Why are you the most qualified person to deliver it? And so on. It worked well enough, and several projects and companies were launched from within the Kublai platform. But there is a price to pay for success, if you call this success:\u00a0\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>not everybody can succeed. Everybody can make a credible proposition, if they work hard, but only a minority will break even. The arts and culture are seemingly characterized by a structural oversupply of labor, which is just a fancy way to say that everybody wants to be an actress or a guitarist. Harsh selection keeps the ecosystem healthy, but it can be hard on the individuals. This was always the case: I grew up in a small town before the Internet, and it was practically impossible to get the ear of professional A&amp;R people. (Rock) musicians were recruited through highly idiosyncratic channels concentrated in one major city per country.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>in a market economy, artistic success just is not going to happen without a healthy dose of strategic thinking and entrepreneurship. Sometimes it will be some manager figure to supply them: since everybody and their horse are competing for these figures' attention, it is increasingly the artists themselves who have do to the dirty work. In Kublai, we worked to reprogramme creatives from a \"my ideas are not recognized\" attitude to a \"homework first, recognition maybe later\" one.</li>\n\n</ol>Does this correspond to your experience?\n\n", "created_at": "2012-02-17 13:42:21", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:00.153148", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 714, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1309, "user_id": 100, "topic_id": 1276, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\u00a0\n\nToute civilisation est port\u00e9e par un Homme et le promeut. Un \u00ab\u00a0Homme\u00a0\u00bb est un mod\u00e8le de l\u2019humain. Un mod\u00e8le est form\u00e9 par des qualit\u00e9s (comp\u00e9tences intellectuelles, pragmatiques, physiques, morales) qui d\u00e9finiraient l\u2019Homme que nous voulons \u00eatre ou qui serait bien pour notre civilisation, et par l\u2019exclusion de d\u00e9fauts (intellectuels, pragmatiques, physiques, moraux) dont l\u2019existence nuirait \u00e0 cet Homme. Pour exclure ces d\u00e9fauts, pour renforcer les qualit\u00e9s ou les rendre utilisables, chaque civilisation met en place une p\u00e9dagogie plus ou moins complexe.\n\nLes travaux des anthropologues comme Georges Dum\u00e9zil, Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss, des sociologues, des historiens, \u00e9clairent cette notion d\u2019\u00ab\u00a0Homme\u00a0\u00bb.\n\nIl a exist\u00e9 diff\u00e9rents mod\u00e8les d\u2019Homme et nos civilisations actuelles sont b\u00e2ties sur des Hommes particuliers et des p\u00e9dagogies particuli\u00e8res. A l\u2019int\u00e9rieur des diff\u00e9rentes civilisations nous trouvons diff\u00e9rents mod\u00e8les d\u2019Homme pour exercer des fonctions particuli\u00e8res. Georges Dum\u00e9zil d\u00e9crivait la civilisation indo-europ\u00e9enne comme caract\u00e9ris\u00e9e par trois fonctions, celle du roi-pr\u00eatre, celle du guerrier et celle du producteur-reproducteur. Ces trois fonctions \u00e9tant assur\u00e9es par des humains. C\u2019est pourquoi nous pouvons dire qu\u2019il existait un \u00ab\u00a0Homme roi-pr\u00eatre\u00a0\u00bb diff\u00e9rent d\u2019un \u00ab\u00a0Homme guerrier\u00a0\u00bb,\u00a0diff\u00e9rents d\u2019un \u00ab\u00a0Homme producteur-reproducteur\u00a0\u00bb. Ces trois mod\u00e8les n\u00e9cessitaient des qualit\u00e9s propres, en excluaient d\u2019autres. Pour s\u00e9lectionner ces qualit\u00e9s, les d\u00e9velopper et exclure celles qui ne convenaient pas, des p\u00e9dagogies \u00e9taient n\u00e9cessaires. Ces trois \u00ab\u00a0Hommes\u00a0\u00bb r\u00e9unis, articul\u00e9s les uns aux autres forment l\u2019\u00a0\u00ab\u00a0Homme indo-europ\u00e9en\u00a0\u00bb.\n\nLa r\u00e9ussite de ces diff\u00e9rents Hommes se manifeste dans leur capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 g\u00e9n\u00e9rer une civilisation. Nous dirons ici qu\u2019une civilisation est ce qui permet \u00e0 un ensemble d\u2019humain d\u2019exister, de tirer partie de ressources, d\u2019en cr\u00e9er de nouvelles, de g\u00e9n\u00e9rer des connaissances et de les diffuser \u00e0 tous les membres de la communaut\u00e9. Une civilisation est caract\u00e9ris\u00e9e par ses institutions et ses diverses productions sociales. C\u2019est pourquoi nous pouvons parler de civilisation musulmane, chr\u00e9tienne, juda\u00efque, romaine, grecque, indo-europ\u00e9enne, dans la partie dite Occidentale du monde. Le raisonnement est valide pour les autres parties du monde. Tout Homme est li\u00e9 \u00e0 une Nature ou \u00e0 un R\u00e9el qui est d\u00e9crit de diff\u00e9rentes mani\u00e8res, par des mythes, des connaissances de type scientifique. Ces descriptions sont lisibles car elles s\u2019appuient sur des arguments, des preuves que l\u2019on peut faire partager \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9.\n\nToutes les p\u00e9riodes de changement sont caract\u00e9ris\u00e9es par la mise en avant de nouveaux mod\u00e8les d\u2019humains, de nouveaux Hommes et par le renforcement des mod\u00e8les anciens. Tout le monde se demande quel est le meilleur Homme pour les temps \u00e0 venir. Et tout le monde veut participer \u00e0 sa d\u00e9finition, veut y mettre des qualit\u00e9s importantes et faire dispara\u00eetre des comportements, des fa\u00e7ons de faire jug\u00e9es d\u00e9testables.\n\nAu moment o\u00f9 l\u2019Europe se forme, nous pouvons choisir une fa\u00e7on de faire qui mettra tous ces mod\u00e8les en comp\u00e9tition, luttant les uns contre les autres de fa\u00e7on la plupart du temps violente, pour \u00eatre le seul Homme possible et \u00e9liminer les autres. Nous pouvons aussi d\u00e9cider que ces d\u00e9finitions, ces bagarres, ces guerres, ne concernent que des personnes autoris\u00e9es, les philosophes, les gens de science, les religieux, les politiques, mais pas tout le monde.\n\nMais nous pouvons d\u00e9cider que ces fa\u00e7ons de faire ne sont pas civilis\u00e9es car elles ignorent un acquis solide de nos sciences et qui vaut le coup d\u2019\u00eatre transmis dans le monde \u00e0 venir. Aucun humain n\u2019est capable actuellement de d\u00e9crire compl\u00e8tement le R\u00e9el \u00e0 partir d\u2019un seul mod\u00e8le. De m\u00eame aucun humain n\u2019est capable actuellement de d\u00e9crire compl\u00e8tement l\u2019humain \u00e0 partir d\u2019un seul mod\u00e8le.\n\nPar contre nous arrivons \u00e0 d\u00e9crire assez compl\u00e8tement le R\u00e9el en articulant diff\u00e9rents mod\u00e8les entre eux, chacun des mod\u00e8les \u00e9tant compos\u00e9 de connaissances certaines que nous avons sur le R\u00e9el et aussi d\u2019hypoth\u00e8ses. Nous devons arriver \u00e0 d\u00e9crire l\u2019humain de m\u00eame, de fa\u00e7on assez compl\u00e8te, en articulant diff\u00e9rents \u00ab\u00a0Hommes\u00a0\u00bb entre eux, chaque Homme \u00e9tant compos\u00e9s de connaissances certaines et d\u2019hypoth\u00e8ses qui justifient les qualit\u00e9s que nous voulons lui donner et les d\u00e9fauts que nous voulons faire dispara\u00eetre.\n\nBien s\u00fbr mon affirmation impose d\u00e9j\u00e0 un mod\u00e8le, un Homme pour l\u2019avenir con\u00e7ut, construit par l\u2019articulation de diff\u00e9rents mod\u00e8les d\u2019Homme. Et je refuse un mod\u00e8le d\u2019Homme unique car de toute fa\u00e7on il nous conduirait vers l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019une tyrannie.\n\nIl me semble que \u00e7a vaut le coup de tenter mon pari.\n\nNous serons civilis\u00e9s si nous pouvons concevoir diff\u00e9rents Hommes et les articuler entre eux pour d\u00e9crire au mieux l\u2019humanit\u00e9. Alors chaque humain pourra choisir d\u2019\u00eatre l\u2019un de ces Hommes, ou plusieurs en cherchant comment les articuler en lui. Et chaque Homme incarn\u00e9 pourra s\u2019articuler dans l\u2019espace social \u00e0 d\u2019autres Hommes incarn\u00e9s. Nous construirons alors une civilisation pouvant faire vivre de mani\u00e8re incarn\u00e9e toutes les connaissances que nous avons sur l\u2019humain et celles \u00e0 venir, et probablement toutes les connaissances que nous avons sur le R\u00e9el et celles \u00e0 venir. Tout cela sans que les humains s\u2019opposent les uns aux autres en se d\u00e9truisant, en d\u00e9truisant leurs connaissances et leurs productions au nom de la supr\u00e9matie d\u2019un Homme.\n\nJe vous propose pour r\u00e9aliser ce pari de faire comme si nous menions un jeu. Tout jeu est structur\u00e9 par un \u00ab\u00a0comment faire\u00a0\u00bb et un \u00ab\u00a0comment ne pas faire\u00a0\u00bb. Dans mon jeu, \u00ab\u00a0comment en faire\u00a0\u00bb implique d\u2019apporter des connaissances existantes et vari\u00e9es pour justifier le mod\u00e8le. La coop\u00e9ration est la meilleure voie pour convoquer ses connaissances et ceux qui les portent.\n\nLe jeu\u00a0:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>D\u00e9crivez ce que pourrait faire votre Homme et ce qu\u2019il ne peut pas faire,</li>\n\n<li>Justifiez votre description par des exemples d\u2019exp\u00e9rience,</li>\n\n<li>Justifiez votre description par des mod\u00e8les neuro-cognitifs et physiques</li>\n\n<li>D\u00e9crivez la p\u00e9dagogie n\u00e9cessaire pour d\u00e9velopper les comp\u00e9tences de cet Homme ou pour \u00e9liminer les d\u00e9fauts de l\u2019humain qui va l\u2019incarner,</li>\n\n<li>Montrez comment cet Homme peut vivre en transformant des ressources pour faire des produits, des entreprises, des institutions,</li>\n\n<li>Vous ne devez pas faire de coups de th\u00e9\u00e2tre\u00a0: les qualit\u00e9s que vous avez d\u00e9finies, les d\u00e9fauts que vous avez voulu \u00e9liminer doivent \u00eatre suffisants pour que vive votre Homme.</li>\n\n</ul><strong>Un de ces Hommes, l'\"Homme lumineux\"</strong>\n\nVoici le transcript d'un travail sur un Homme \u00e0 partir de l'exp\u00e9rience du Kundalini.

Voici un exemple:\n\n\u00a0\n\nChat on Kundalini Human Model\n\nI noticed that Alberto Cottica wrote recently, in an Edgeryders status by John F Moore regarding the New Year, about the \"unutilized part of intelligence\" (see this link: http://t.co/cOTo5ma):\n\n\"In times of crisis and dwindling finances, the unutilized part of our intelligence is pretty much the only fresh resource we can throw at our global problems!\" Yesterday, at a chat of my \\#Caf\u00e9Philosophique or transnational \\#BarPhilosophique, there was a discussion between @Lyne_Robichaud @LeaVinci and myself, about models of Human beings.\n\nHere is the transcript of this chat. It can serve as a conversation starter, lead to the creation of knowledge, encourage us to define a model, which may be useful for future applications.\n\n\u00a0\n\n@FilippiMichel \u2015 Quel est ton mod\u00e8le d'humain Lyne? quel est le mod\u00e8le d'humain pour LeaVinci? De quel Homme avez-vous l'espoir? | What is your model of Human, Lyne? What is the model Human for LeaVinci? What Mankind do you hope for?

Our contribution to the report should be maximum 5 pages long and contain as they put it \"out-of-the-box ideas and innovative solutions\" put forward in Edgeryders discussions- both on the platform and durin<span>g the conference. I'd suggest working out of a shared document so anyone can follow it as it progresses and also contribute to it- anyone who does will be included as co-authors.

How can we explore more of our loving and creative potential as well as create a world that reflects this inner beauty and love?\u00a0\n\nThese are two vital questions for me and why I'm\u00a0\"Creating new realities\". There's this beautiful play between the physical world and the non-physical (spiritual), which goes beyond words and at the same time can be very simple in heart. In my experience we are learning to trust and act upon our hearts' desires and letting go of the certainties of the known. Learning to be fully into life and at the same time peacefully creating the life that's feels really good, often being unpredictable, confronting with new challenges along the way of growth. Yet, totally clear from another perspective, which is often only afterwards understood.\u00a0\n\nTo me there's roughly two aspects to creation, finding love and expressing it. In whatever way feels most relevant. So creating new realities is about this expression. Expressions of love, expressions of fascination, of being intrigued by a question. This passion, like life can often only be looked upon afterwards. Yet is highly stimulating during the process. At the same time, we can experience a deep peace from within. Growing and integrating. Expressing and being silent. Creating new realities requires both in my experience. Going into something, almost blindly. Being into the question, into life, almost unconsciously. Letting go of what I already know. And at the same time being fully aware of what's happening, even when I don't know where I'm going. I'm fully aware of what I'm experiencing, all of the feelings and sensations, getting to know myself. To me, creating is about holding space and love, it's also about exploring new states of being. More expansive versions of myself. Going into the unknown. Creating new realities, riding the edges, exploring new perspectives, and at the same time, taking care of each other, holding space, accepting all of yourself and everyone around you. Knowing the lows to accept the others and overcoming doubt, finding highs to thrive and create a more amazing life.\u00a0\n\nSo can we\u00a0do that?\n\nCreate new realities and find deeper love within and for each other? Can we create and hold space? Can we set up a world that's a reflection of the love and creative potential? Can we shine light on some of the systems that enslave us (like the way money is used to control us) and create new systems that support the dynamics of our potential? Can we let go of heavy concepts and perceptions such as ownership? Can we create a world that's natural and harmonious, yet inspiring and unknown? Can we co-create out of passion rather than looking for security? Can we step into the unknown and create with love? So how do we deepen the understanding of ourselves and our behaviours? And more importantly, how can we let go of everything that doesn't serve us. Can we accelerate into loving ourselves? Which techniques can we use? Which perspectives can we take? And physically how can we create lifes that actually feel inspiring and authentic?\n\nOver the last years I've been organizing several series of meetings about personal transformation and\u00a0living from the heart\u00a0(for instance;\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.inderuimte.org/vrijmetgeld/\">Vrij met Geld</a>/ Free with Money). Also I've worked and lived with changemakers communities, for instance at the <a href=\"http://synergyhub.nl/\">Synergyhub</a> in Rotterdam and several ecovillages/ ecocenter's, as well as intensely researched the topic of enlightenment and spiritual growth and the physical world. Over the last months I've started writing a book: <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/213665086\">Step into creation - guidebook for a co-creative universe</a>. Recently I've started a platform \"<a href=\"http://creatingnewrealities.co/\">Creating new realities</a>\". One of the important lessons I learned is: \"you can't co-create if you don't resonate\" and \"a little shift in perspective\" is often all you need to get back into flow. When I stop resisting, things happen. \"<em>When I let go, I know</em>\". Behind the known is a infinite field of potential. There lies true excitement. There is infinite inspiration at our disposal. And at the same time, it's nice to play with the physical. So to make the world a reflection of our spiritual growth. To let both go hand in hand. To grow and deepen the quality of relationships and communities. To develop the society and create things that represent our love for the world and the mystery of creation. These are some of my most important reflections over my experiences. That's what I'd love to inspire and catalyze! To create realities that are infinitely inspiring and joyful.\u00a0\n\nLooking forward to co-create with you!\n\nEwoud\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-19 10:27:39", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 04:40:10.950566", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 862, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 130.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21300, "user_id": 2448, "topic_id": 5422, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Fixed</b>\n\nIt's working ok now, after the permissions were changed.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-03-15 10:39:16", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:58.453626", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 15, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2469, "user_id": 1818, "topic_id": 2436, "post_number": 1, "raw": "For the past 10-20+ years, Life in Africa's members have lived in an ad-hoc camp for the displaced, near a rock quarry on the outskirts of the Ugandan capital.

In Europe and elsewhere. It is a sketch so far and can only be realised with your help. So please be generous with your comments and help me to reach out to others who might find this interesting or relevant. Here goes!</em>\n\nA year ago I was invited to do a <a href=\"/t/my-experience-at-improving-reality/3997\" style=\"text-decoration: none; color: rgb(233, 92, 46);\">talk</a> at a creative industries event called Improving Reality . In my talk I presented two areas where I believe cultural practitioners can really play a large role: countering the rise of authoritarian movements in our societies, as well as helping to bridge the gaps between need for making a living and need for meaning. It is my belief that the poverty of imagination and access to working models for how people can sustain themselves (psychosocially as well as economically) is what creates a vacuum free for authoritarian leaders and to fill with whatever empty promises they like.\n\nThe reasoning:\n\n<strong>Innovation is supposedly much needed and sought after in response to systemic crises. </strong>Change very often happens at the edges of what is deemed acceptable - culturally and legally speaking. Even though this initial input is needed by the mainstream in order to adapt, our societies seem to be moving towards increasingly authoritarian cultures.\n\n<strong>The ability to use innovation against systemic crises is limited by the ability to shape new understandings of value, meaning, and work.</strong> It is also limited by our ability to influence <em>how </em>politics is done (and our understanding of <em>where</em> democratic participation takes place outside of designated spaces for political participation). Because everything is defined in relation to work, responding to global systemic crises boils down to coming up with new ways of bridging the growing gap between the need to make a living and the need to create meaning.\n\n<strong>Culture can be an effective carrier signal for deeper changes in a community</strong>(see this post about Edgeryders involvement in the bid). It is also very cheap in comparison to other kinds of intervention.\n\n<h2>Possible \"big\" questions for this track:</h2>\n\n<strong>1. Can we find examples/cases where others have succeeded in creating protected spaces for radical experimentation that could resist authoritarian attacks?</strong>\n\n<strong>2. Can we find examples/case of socially and economically self-sustaining contexts/projects/spaces for this kind of experimentation?</strong>\n\nIf we could find people who have driven or know about examples to present, then we could have a really meaningful discussion around how cultural production is understood, valued and resourced.\n\n<h2>Possible threads to bring together:</h2>\n\n<strong>1. Once you are on board with the thinking- <em>h</em></strong><strong><em>ow </em>does that actually translate into the shaping of effective policies and investments</strong>, what lessons can be learned from previous efforts? To the best of my knowledge this requires<strong> the administrative plumbing to allow for new ways of doing things</strong> <strong>Do we know of civil servants who have managed to make this happen?</strong>\n\n- Bob Palmer is someone from whom I think we could learn ALOT about this, especially what <em>doesn't </em>work, don't you think @noemi?\n\n- Also, @caroline has both a lot of experience and a wealth of contacts- e.g. people who participated at Politics for Tomorrow (loved Jesper's and Marlieke's presentations, also Philippe's about the hand book for mayors in Austria). Would love to hear you synthesise what you have learned from the work of looking into this Caroline?\n\n<strong>Edgeryders co-produced a relevant book project with the current Swedish minister of Nordic cooperation and Future Issues.</strong> It is clear that the work we did together has had an impact on how she is interpreting her ministerial role (see this <a href=\"http://motherboard.vice.com/read/swedens-minister-of-the-future-explains-how-to-make-politicians-think-long-term\" style=\"text-decoration: none; color: rgb(233, 92, 46); font-size: 19.2000007629395px; line-height: 26.112003326416px;\">Vice interview with Kristina</a>, see my summary of Edgeryders contributions <a href=\"http://documents.mx/documents/the-baltic-edge-pre-print-draft-excerpts.html\" style=\"text-decoration: none; color: rgb(233, 92, 46); font-size: 19.2000007629395px; line-height: 26.112003326416px;\">here</a><span>, ping </span>@inge</a><span> re older posts). @kiravde</a> know of anyone who could be contacted about this in Belgium (remember email invitation for hanging out on saturday? look up Pieter who is cc:Ed and maybe ask for contacts a la Flamande)? Also I suggest Peter De Smedt at JRC, very actively engaged and may know some people.</span>\n\n<strong><span>2. Do we know of grassroots/bottom up spaces that have managed to make this happen? </span></strong><span>E.g. one of the key obstacles to sustainability of creative initiatives, and the individuals who drive them, are the lack of access to permanently affordable spaces for living and working in urban environments.</span>\n\n<span>- Elizabeth from Princessinengarten and I had a long conversation about how to connect with protagonists of experimental initiatives  @ecl and build something together that makes it work their while <em>(PS: Elisabeth, gl\u00f6mde f\u00f6rresten ber\u00e4tta att jag f\u00f6ljt upp och hittat en utlysning som vi kunde s\u00f6ka tillsammans inf\u00f6r detta...talas vid snart? deadline i december!!). </em></span>\n\n- @kiravde it may be worthwhile to get in touch with people from different grassroots/independent spaces, Belgian foundations and local/European institutions who could contribute to this track?\n\n- Also @matteo_uguzzoni</a> I know you have been doing some work that us relevant to this. Perhaps you could do a session? Perhaps there is someone whom you would like to have a conversation/possible collaboration or support from around this?\n\n- I was approached by Jon Pratty (Arts Council England) and someone from the British Council who's card I have maned to lose after the talk at improving reality.

Currently, the following\u00a0is (mainly) what I am busy with:\n\n<strong>URGENCI</strong> \u2013 The Global Network for Community Supported Agriculture (CSA)\n\nSince June 2015 I am a member of the Urgenci kernel -the steering committee for the European part of the movement, and the European Research Group on CSA -with which we conducted the first ever European census on CSA -the report can be found <a href=\"http://urgenci.net/new-report-european-csa-overview-released-by-the-european-csa-research-group/\">here</a>. Our second major undertaking for 2015-2016 was the creation of a European Declaration on CSA. This involved the research group drafting a first proposal which we had to take back to our respective countries for consultations and then collectivise everything again and come up with a final draft that was formally presented at the third European meeting on CSA (the report on that will be out soon, but <a href=\"http://ostrava.urgenci.net/\">here</a> you can find out more about what we did in Ostrava). Here is the <a href=\"http://urgenci.net/the-european-csa-declaration-adopted-in-ostrava/\">declaration</a> and this is footage from the historical moment of its first announcement:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/sQi1BKLFWzc\n\nThe writing process for the declaration gave me the chance to organise a two-day event where those already working in CSAs in Greece had the chance to meet in person for the first time -a valuable experience. We also held \u2018a CSA open day\u2019 where a team of experts (accountant, lawyer, personal growth coach, farmers, CSA coordinators) had the chance to explain various aspects of the CSA idea.\n\nI am also very glad to say I was part in the inaugural meeting for the <a href=\"http://urgenci.net/the-mediterranean-csa-project/\">Mediterranean Network for Local-Based Solidarity Partnerships</a> which we hope will strengthen the ties between our countries and projects.\n\n<strong>Action Research through participatory video making</strong>\n\nIn the capacity of co-facilitator I am working together with Christabel Buchanan -from the Coventry Centre for Agroecology Water and Resilience, on \u2018Real Food Utopias\u2019: an action research project mapping and tracking alternative food systems and economies in and around Thessaloniki. We made an open call inviting individuals from a variety of formal and informal groups. Through this process we came up collectively with a series of themes to be further explored. We then held training sessions on participatory video-making (from story boarding to collective editing) and then formed working groups for each theme. Then we organise public showings to get feedback and to instigate discussion and hopefully action by community members -like the creation of a Food Policy Council.\n\n<strong>Currently the themes we are working on are:</strong>\n\n-alternative currencies and food economies;\n\n-a look into peri-urban gardening in terms of autonomy and\n\n-the production cycle of vegetables as opposed to that of chicken farming within the project;\n\n-lessons learnt and struggles of existing projects: a critical view on hindrances to growth; -presentation of a social cooperative enterprise.\n\nThe first videos are in the final editing process and will be ready soon. This is an ongoing project and you will be able to find out more about it <a href=\"https://alternativefoodeconomiesgreece.wordpress.com/\">here</a> as we continue uploading information and new developments.\n\n<strong>Refugee Food Journeys</strong>\n\nAs we all know Greece has been struck the hardest from the influx of refugees in recent years and we felt we needed to include them in our quest for food sovereignty. This part of our research focuses on matters of food consumption and food waste in refugee camps. This is our\u00a0 first video on this issue:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/F1pvIQ_MCA4\n\n<strong>Solidarity Exports</strong>\n\nTogether with Antonis Diamantidis, a fellow food sovereignty activist, farmer, and organiser of a CSA group of producers called \u2018Corinthian Orchard\u2019 we have just launched this scheme aiming to create direct links between small agroecological producers of Greece and CSAs, food coops etc in other European countries by providing each party with what they need in a fair and respectful way. Our goal is to not compete with the local farmers and thus we will only export produce that is consumed but does not grow in their regions -like citrus fruits and olive oil. Through this we will be actively supporting small Greek farmers, who suffer from land fragmentation and stand...at the bottom of the food chain with respect to the markets and the middlemen. We are also hoping to include \u2018ugly fruits\u2019 in this scheme raising even more awareness on food dumping/waste/loss issues. For more information on this please look <a href=\"http://perivolikorinthou.gr/user/login?destination=proionta\">here</a> or write to <a href=\"mailto:antonis@perivolikorinthou.gr\">antonis@perivolikorinthou.gr</a>\n\n<strong>Hellenic Network for Agroecology, Food Sovereignty and Access to Land</strong>\n\nSince the crisis begun, it is becoming increasingly difficult to do anything in a formal, legal way. This is one of the main reasons why most groups here operate under the radar -which on the other hand is not necessarily a bad thing. But this means that growth comes in relatively slow steps and is hindered by the lack of access to funds and other resources. For example, setting up an NGO costs around \u20ac1000 and has an annual \u20ac1000 \u2018trade tax\u2019 (literally a levy to allow you to do business) -this applies to social enterprises too. And although this is not as bad as having to prepay 100% of next year\u2019s taxation like with most small businesses (or 50% for farmers) it still might pose a problem for people who want to do exactly that: do something without business profit in mind.\n\nSo in this context, I am happy to announce that we are currently in the process of setting up our grass-roots non-profit organisation to to help us with our endeavours in these fields. What we have in mind is summarized in the following fields of action:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\tAssist in the creation of a movement on food sovereignty in Greece; link existing initiatives with each other and with similar projects abroad; and promote FS in all ways possible.</li>\n\n<li>\tIn collaboration with other European partners (like La Via Campesina and CAWR) set up (a network of) Agroecological Training centres and knowledge exchange hubs. We need to find ways to make our farmers independent form fertiliser companies (even if organic), seed producers and certifying organisations. We need farmers who can stand on their own feet, be self sufficient and knowledgeable to deal with eventualities by using what nature provides.</li>\n\n<li>\tSave Greek agricultural land from the Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund and ensure its utilization through concession or purchase by our group in the context of communal ownership. This will be a major undertaking ensuring the right of small agroecological farmers to have access to land and safeguarding the land\u2019s status as a common good.</li>\n\n<li>\tIncrease awareness and offer technical support, training, and tools to create CSA schemes around the country.</li>\n\n<li>\tPromote the creation of Food Policy Councils around the country.</li>\n\n<li>\tBecome the official Greek hub for informal groups working on food sovereignty, enabling them to gain access to financial support, tools and other resources.</li>\n\n<li>\tIncrease awareness and educate farmers and consumers in order to become more conscious through seminars, campaigns and training sessions about sustainable farming methods and consumption patterns and the agroecological way of life. Also offer tools and training in communication and inner development that are crucial factors for the success of any endeavour (eg non violent communication, social permaculture and inner transition). Needless to say that schools and children will be pivotal in our schemes.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nSo if all of this sounds interesting, if you feel the urge to get involved, or if you have information and contacts that can help, please contact me to join forces :)\n\n", "created_at": "2016-12-21 09:06:42", "updated_at": "2017-10-04 16:44:00.225623", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1519, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 91.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30918, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 2267, "post_number": 12, "raw": "<b>Talk2Me?</b>\n\nJust for the record: [K] mentioned \"something else ... was it Talk2Me?\" above, not included in your list probably because it's not sure what it was.

is that often \"network\" and \"organization\" are used interchangeably, while I believe they need to be seen as different - with several organizations and projects being able to be supportive of an intentional network, yet being very aware of NOT letting one or more organizations end up taking control or assuming to \"represent\" the network.</span>\n\n- A second very important point, is for such organizations to support an intentional network without enclosing it, I see the importance in the organizations and legal frameworks supporting infrastructure that can serve as a commons for the ( non enclosed ) intentional networks.\n\nThe organizations can choose who they want to govern themselves and operate, and their support in resources is aimed at intentional commons.\n\nThe big risk I see is in having organizations and individuals taking conrol on a commons.\n\n///\n\nSome more specific examples,\n\nFrom my personal past experience with other networks / organizations over the last 12 years ( including european youth movements related to green political parties , but also hospitality networks , ... )\n\nI noticed patterns of a few very motivated people concentrating\u00a0all the work in their own hands over time.\n\nBy doing so, I realized that defacto the power ends up centralized.\n\nI also realize this can lead to burnouts, by making processes dependent on specific people.\n\nI realized\u00a0such people would be very competent workaholics.\n\n<span>I could see a progressive dissempowerment of the community\u00a0because of the centralization of contextual information. \u00a0Political games would be played,</span><span>\u00a0enclosures\u00a0creat</span><span>ed</span><span>\u00a0that would be</span><span>\u00a0shared only with\u00a0a few</span><span>\u00a0political allies and collaborators. \u00a0 These would often, in my personal experience, be related to specific priviledges , that would range from covering costs for attending meetings ( this is likely the most acceptable form in my view, as long as it supports a commons ), to specific priviledges of paid positions , or power positions within a specific organization.</span>\n\n<span>A common patterns I also noticed in my past experience, is that a small minority would build on the enthusiasm of community, and end up representing such community, or rather, a networked intentional community. \u00a0In the case of the young greens, just a few individuals claimed representing over 20 000 people, even though most of these people where inactive, or did not even know they where being represented. \u00a0 \u00a0</span>\n\n<span>In\u00a0the case of hospitality networks, I noticed progressive developments which in the case of couchsurfing, lead\u00a0what initially was a network into evolving into\u00a0a not for profit organization, and then into a corporation. \u00a0 \u00a0 I witnessed developments and migrations of volunteers, who actually made the success and developed the networks , move from hospitalityclub to couchsurfing and then later to bewelcome. \u00a0 I will be happy to detail some of the underlining dynamics, related to power and governance, for those who may not be accustomed to these networks and their underlining forms of organization and development.</span>\n\n<span>I wish to discuss on this thread, ways to focus on supporting a commons in the form of an intentional network, eventually through using or partnersing with organizations or institutions, while at the same time defending such commons.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>I also wish to invite us to have a look at this thread :</span>\n\n<a href=\"/t/design-ating-purpose/1934/22\" style=\"color: rgb(233, 92, 46);\">https://edgeryders.eu/comment/6621#comment-6621</a>\n\n<span>where I\u00a0raised a few questions about branding, or more exactly identifiers.</span>\n\n<span>The identifiers, and diversity of identifiers, imho also has an influence on understanding the agencies, and potential liberty of internal modes of organization of such brands / identifiers\n\n( for example, Nadia suggests the following social contract draft -

My daughter was 7, and my son was 2. I was still breastfeeding and thought I was just tired and stressed out.\n\nWhat came next was an avalanche of\u00a0investigations and meetings with doctors form many\u00a0hospitals. After ruling out all sorts of terrible diseases and trying different treatments with no success, I went to Vienna where my condition was confirmed: Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia.\u00a0The newest drug for AIHA (Rituximab) \u00a0was still not approved in Romania for this rare disease, so I basically moved to Vienna where thet gave it to me, with no positive outcome, and\u00a0finally I had my spleen removed and got well.\n\nIt happened in \u00a0March 2012.\n\nIn November 2012 I was again in Vienna for artistic reasons (and the usual check-up). This is when I read for the first time about the Network of Cytostatics. Everything was familiar to me: the oldest pharmacy in Vienna, the office above Mariahilferstr, but mostly, the struggle to regain one's health....\n\nIt was too soon for me to get involved, tha trauma was too recent.\n\n\u00a0But in February 2013, a good friend, Simona Tache, shared on Facebook a status about needing someone going to Bucharest from Vienna.\n\n\u00a0It clicked something inside me and I responded.\u00a0\n\nWhat came next was overwhelming.\n\n\u00a0Yes, I travelled\u00a0home with medicine, calmly taking them through security and bringing them to Valeriu, the taxi driver that distributed them to the ones in need.\u00a0More important was the fact that doing a simple thing, an easy gesture, meant helping someone's health and fighting a system that seemed not to care about the people. Everyone I talked to about the network felt the same: it is the least we can do!\n\n\u00a0I truly believe people have the need to do good, to offer, to help each other.\n\nThe Network was a way of getting people together for a good purpose. I think it is the main reason it worked so well.\n\nIt responded the needs of others, but also our own need to give (time/ help/ encouragement).\n\nMy own personal gain, though, was tremendous. Not only you feel good helping others, but I became very good friends with Vlad Voiculescu, the initiator if the Network, supporting each other in many other so called impossible projects or just knowing we are there at a click or phone call away.\n\nI got involved because I knew what it means to be helpless against a disease and I will remain involved for as long as I will live, because this Network might not be needed now for cancer drugs, but it created a gathering of great souls that will be for sure needed for many other aspects of our society that need deep and profound healing.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-06-27 08:25:22", "updated_at": "2018-05-26 04:24:22.180071", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 544, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 126.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10652, "user_id": 3069, "topic_id": 5491, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Thanks!</b>\n\nLets see how we can grow a happy OpenCare community :)\n\n", "created_at": "2016-04-06 18:03:43", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:01.149452", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 15, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [6492], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14612, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3706, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Not making 50!</b>\n\nI can't afford to do one for every participant.

Attention was directed towards the Nozzle; it had several movable segments...    Clearly this essential tool resembled the unMonastery project. The behind the scene\u2019s end that pried open the hose opening and wedged itself tenaciously fast with its concentric rings of teeth that root the whole operation in place was clearly the committee that had provided for the unMonasterani\u2019s inclusion in their vision of social and cultural renewal. We ourselves were the working parts of the nozzle whose delicate interplay shaped the desired flow closer the more heralded front end. Our noble task: to dispense a Fountain of Ideas at a rate most suited to the intended splash. We were by nature finicky, but given sufficient attention to detail we could vary from an accelerated cleansing jet of significant pressure to a finely dispersed spray suitable for cultivation delicate growth. In an admittedly forced extension of the metaphor, the finally working part of the nut that prevented the desired setting from losing its grip was proffered as the ladies and gentlemen of the press - our unheralded but imminently useful co-workers should we need to retain the rate of flow. Concealed beneath the rim of the table was the unmentionable fact that until the hose was attached to the water supply of the citizenry, it was virtually useless...

Modern-day Pompei, of course, contains the ruins of the ancient Roman city of Pompeii; it also contains many other things, including an aggressive presence of organized crime, so the project is not exactly a walk in the park.\n\nBut open data and transparency are a powerful force. Despite many cultural resistances, we are making progress. Our most important success so far is probably the <a href=\"http://open.pompeiisites.org/\">open data portal</a> of Grande Progetto Pompei, a very large scale government project that allocated 100 million EUR to the area \u2013 mostly to preserve the Pompeii dig and the services thereof. We started releasing financial data on how this money was spent, who is winning the tenders etc. back in September 2014, and have kept the site up-to-date; additionally, we organised citizen monitoring initiatives, worked with local schools to explain the importance of open data, and convinced the Pompeii superintendent to open the site to the fabulous <a href=\"http://www.wikilovesmonuments.it/welcome/\">Wiki Loves Monuments</a> initiative (Italian law requires an authorization to take pictures of cultural heritage landmarks).\u00a0\n\nIn 2015, last year of the OpenPompei project, we decided to up our game. We forged an alliance with the tiny, but brave and potentially hugely significant scene of open data archaeology. These guys are really marginal, <em>now.</em>\u00a0But they hold the keys to a sweeping change of the guard in archaeology and cultural heritage management. They can do computational research that sweeps across many digs, as long as they have interoperable data models. They can do <em>4</em>-D maps (in fact, they\u00a0<em>have to</em>\u00a0do them, because you in archaeology you reference artefacts not only in space but in time too!). Soon they will be all over the journals, develop augmented reality experiences for the visitors to the archaeological sites, and start getting the top jobs. If they have an open mentality, they can really help making cultural heritage open. And open culture is powerful, inclusive. It frees up interaction with cultural heritage and history, and makes everyone a protagonist of history's great tapestry.\n\nSo, first we organised a \"school of open archaeological data\" in Pompeii (inside the actual dig!). We called it <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/OpenPompei/richards-45930365\">STVDIVM</a>, thinking English is great but it would be fun for the open archaeologist to reclaim a dead language, Latin, as their cultural signifier. That went well: the enthusiasm was palpable. Very few archaeologists can code or data crunch, but man, are they ready to learn!\u00a0\n\nBased on that experience, we are now taking yet another leap of faith, and dreamed up the first-ever archaeological hackathon, held (again) inside the Pompeii dig. We called it SCRIPTORIVM, because we can and because by now Latin has become a sort of badge of honour. <a href=\"http://www.openpompei.it/scriptorivm/index_ita.html\">SCRIPTORIVM's minisite</a> has the navigation interface in Latin, and its video trailer is in Latin too.\u00a0\n\nI guess I am sharing this experience here because it is yet another edge, one that almost no one is thinking about. And also because many edgeryders from Southern Italy have been working on Matera European Capital of Culture 2019 (<a href=\"/t/8-moves-that-worked-for-matera-to-win-the-european-capital-of-culture-2019-title/3959\">and won!</a>), and now there is a crowd in <a href=\"/spot-the-future-bucharest\">Bucharest</a> thinking about maybe becoming European Capital of Culture 2021, and we are talking of something called the Edgeryders Culture Team. To all of you doing culture, my message is: do\u00a0<em>open</em>\u00a0culture. Steamroll anyone trying to play gatekeeper, disrupt entrenched cultural \u00e9lites and make it all about the people. Culture is \u00a0meant to be for everybody, <em>ad universos homines.</em>\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.openpompei.it/2015/05/15/50-2/\">This fantastic post</a> by open archaeologist Gabriele Gattiglia says this better than I can (and uses more and better pop culture references!).\n\nAnd if you want to see what an open data archaeological hackathon looks like, come to Pompeii on June19th and 20th. We will have tracks for data geeks and no-previous-experience-required tasks. If you like it, well \u2013 you can always organize your own, and make it about your city's (or your country's) cultural heritage.

And \u00a0it would like to invite you to put your ideas and feedback on how to you perceive the revival of \u2018community\u2019 feeling among Nepalese after the earthquake and what can we do to make that feeling intact for addressing future needs and challenges. </em>\n\n<strong>Communitarian Approaches to Reconstruction; Why does it matter?</strong>\n\nPost-disaster reconstruction is a complex process and requires the involvement of multiple actors, needs a significant amount of resources, and a wide array of skills. But many a times when it comes to managing such \u00a0situation, involvement of humanitarian organizations alone is not sufficient for effective relief. The engagement of local communities is vital in meeting the needs and requirements of the affected people mostly because communities in post-disaster situation are in need of wide spectrum of necessities \u00a0which can be matched with the diversity of expertise ranging from managing supplies, to crisis mapping , \u00a0fundraising and reconstruction among other that local communities can posses. \u00a0A community driven approach to disaster management therefore is a vision to have a shared future collectively. When community members engage themselves in the reconstruction initiatives, it not just gives them a sense of ownership but also helps to prioritize the tasks to be done during reconstruction. But priorities can still go wrong \u00a0if there is heavy involvement of international organizations \u00a0who are are unaware of local needs. The classic example in the case of Nepal is that although there has been heavy presence of international agencies for the purpose of rescue but their achievement was meager compared to the local actors. For example it was reported the the aircraft's that were sent for rescue and relief operation in Nepal by countries like India and America did very less task in comparison to Nepal Army choppers. In addition to this, Nepal\u2019s case also becomes problematic for the international community due to geopolitical reality. \u00a0For instance, \u00a0reports have been rife on media that the external actors that came in Nepal to assist in the constitution making were ultimately found to be meddling too much in the internal affairs of Nepal and thus ultimately divided the Nepali society along social, political and ethnic line. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Failure to take these factors into consideration seriously may delay the reconstruction work and can often backfire on the benevolent approach undertaken by the international community as well. So the best possible way out to deal with the cases where both culture and geopolitical sensitivities are very high is that the donors should work in tandem with local communities and align their priorities with the official policy of the state.\n\n<strong>The Emergence of \u2018new island of civility\u2019 in post-quake Nepal</strong>\n\nThe April 25th earthquake with a magnitude of 7.3 and the subsequent aftershocks has caused much damage to Nepal. With thousands of lives lost, millions of worth properties destroyed, and infrastructures and cultural heritages of historical and importance ravaged, Nepalese are still struggling to deal with consequences of the disaster. However, given the scale of the damage, the reconstruction works have become an uphill battle mainly because we lack adequate resources. There might be a certain group of people who think that the country which has already been in tatters due to decade long Maoist conflict and the subsequent political turmoil will further divulge in a situation of hopelessness. \u00a0However, there are enough grounds for us to defy this claim primarily because despite all these losses, pains, and tragic outcomes, people at large believed that the societal resiliency that has been observed could be the strength that can truly help to reconstruct Nepal. For instance the database of 220 initiatives that we developed to connect alternative leaders via online platform and the report based on it \u00a0(that will be released shortly) shows an upsurge in the community-led initiatives for post- disaster management. Therefore this \u2018togetherness\u2019 should be seen as an opportunity to rebuild more resilient Nepal in the future. In fact it was fascinating to see the upsurge of new community organizations and individuals voluntarily taking the lead role to rebuild Nepal while the political parties were still in deep slumber and have no idea as what is to be done and how.\n\nThis new mass composed of self-directed citizenry is different from their conventional counterparts who were largely confined to politicized mass mobilization and have no sense of altruism. What is more interesting though is that the rise of this new \u2018island of civility\u2019 in the wake of crisis has brought a new kind of \u2018people\u2019s activism\u2019 \u00a0which is uniting Nepali society despite various artificially created differences based-on caste, class, and ethnicity in the past by the political parties, the civil society and to some extent donors as well. The community based disaster responders are apolitical in nature and are found to have been adopting secular approach while dealing with the problems.\n\nThese lots can certainly be trusted to rebuild Nepal through the way in which they took up the task of reaching out to the victims be it in the case of \u00a0supplying immediate relief materials \u00a0or raising money from friends and families far and distant. The origin of this new sense of voluntarism among the Nepalese shows that they largely value the society they belong to, thus projecting a sense of organic \u2018community resilience\u2019. Through this new strength of community engagement, one can certainly come up with \u2018alternative approaches of development\u2019 in its true sense of the term. \u00a0We could come across ample reasons to believe that if this collective strength of the common people is harnessed properly Nepal will not be far away in addressing various problems ranging from development to democracy building that it faces today.\n\n<strong>The Challenges</strong>\n\nEvery post-disaster situation is unique and differs from one place to another and therefore it is important to understand the local context vis-\u00e0-vis culture, geography, society, political behavior, and economy to develop appropriate recovery and reconstruction strategy. One of the major challenges for any country that has undergone disaster faces while adopting post disaster recovery and reconstruction is how to transform immediate relief efforts into long-term developmental goals. Engagement with communities through various actors, most notably with local people would certainly ensure sustainability of the efforts undertaken and fine tune developmental goals objectively. Equally important would be as how to take both public-private partnership and international community\u2019s efforts on board for the purpose of rebuilding. Amidst all the task of recovery and reconstruction what is also important is to strike a balance between local dynamics of culture and power relationship on which the societies are built, community spirit remains intact and people\u2019s aspirations are fulfilled in time.\n\nHaving said all these, however, the extant state of affairs certainly raises some fundamental questions such as:\n\nFirst: \u00a0how to keep the existing community spirit alive and mobilize it for the purpose of reconstruction activities;\n\nSecond, how best can international community help to reconstruct Nepal and maintain community resiliency at the same time;\n\nThird and perhaps the most important one is can these groups of \u2018island of civility\u2019 be trusted enough to take up broader responsibilities in shaping Nepal\u2019s political future and civil society?\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>", "created_at": "2015-06-13 17:58:13", "updated_at": "2017-08-28 17:36:31.656135", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1454, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 177.0, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2551, 2687, 5, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28447, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 6103, "post_number": 10, "raw": "<b>Here's how it would read without all the green markups</b>\n\nOpenCare is a research project delivered by a consortium of universities and SMEs, who assembled an online community with over 200 participants. Its main goal is prototyping a community-driven model for health and social care. The project\u2019s approach is inspired by the increasing mobilization of global, heterogeneous DIY and hacker/hacker-like communities. An orientation towards action, as well as openness in both community practice and technological solutions, are at the core of how OpenCare is designed: <strong>a bottom-up, digital, civic European arena about healthcare.</strong>\n\nAt this point in time, OpenCare has achieved half of its goals: the prototype of a care-oriented digital space is working at full scale, facilitating different kinds of care-related events, from stories of personal experiences, to conversations about how to improve existing health and political systems and ultimately collaborations between participants both on and offline.\n\nThe paper discusses these results in terms of the politics of everyday life: contributions to the platform are political actions taken by citizens who, while mobilizing to solve \u00a0specific care-related problems (or creating preconditions for these solutions) make a political statement on the viability of an open, collaborative care system. The connections forged across sometimes disparate geographical locations and the knowledges shared through the online platform constitute new forms of online political engagement that translate into offline action. Story-sharing increases connectivity, facilitates the movement of new ideas across health and social care contexts, and creates new and unexpected political alliances.\n\nWe analyze this activity using an interpretative model that can be summarized in this way:\u00a0 the care-oriented digital space (i.e. the one realized in the OpenCare research framework) is considered as a space of possibilities. By this we mean, firstly, an environment where different care-oriented events take place and are generated by the self-driven \u201chacker mindset\u201d of participants. Secondly, this space is characterised by the affordances that are embedded in it and influence the existence and evolution of events.\n\nIn this conceptual framework, the discussion on when and how this space of possibilities becomes an arena for the politics of everyday life is done by observing when and how people meet in it, share information, start conversations and collaborations, and move from the digital space to a physical one. In order to do so, the paper presents four steps:\n\n1) Prior events are analysed (thanks to ethnographic coding and network scientists processing data and rendering visualizations) to give a general overview on how this space of possibilities has worked and is working.\n\n2) Meaningful events, and their evolution, are evaluated through the participants' motivations and their specific background cultures. This will be done using ethnographic primary data (347 posts and 1590 comments) and secondary data (3300 annotations and codes), as well as design tools.\n\n3) Spaces of possibilities are considered to evaluate step by step the relationships between the events, their environment, and the different implicit and explicit affordances embedded in the platform.\n\n4) The data \u00a0is then analyzed with a focus on the implications and potentialities of the interactions on Open Care for the participants\u2019 politics of everyday life.\n\nThe article concludes by introducing threads of research to be developed in the coming months, inside OpenCare and after its conclusion.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-02-24 03:13:34", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:36.761592", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 583, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3310], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2420, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2387, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<h3>From business plan to\u00a0sustainability plan</h3>\n\nCheFare requires a business plan, but many of us (I, for one) are not sure this is an appropriate concept for the unMonastery, which is not a business. Plus, business planning is\u00a0<em>hard.</em> Nobody except me has even gone near it in the whole CheFare story. In the case of the unMonastery, it is made even harder by (a) the fact that there are several project going on in an unMonastery at any given time, each with its own different costs, revenue streams, assets and potential markets; (b) the fact that the unMonastery is a model, a template, meant to work for 10 people in Matera in 2014 as well as for 500 in Wroclaw in 2076 ; and (c) the fact that there is a metalevel, the network of all unMonasteries, in charge of replication, documentation, tranferability etc.\n\nSo, we make a <strong>sustainability\u00a0plan</strong> instead \u2013 just as hard, but at least it does not feel like lying to yours truly unScribe here. <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvvWawrKpTaFdHhQTGk3WXYzR2ZSd0MzRXJSbVFEelE#gid=3\">You can find the first iteration here </a>\u2013 sorry for using Big G's stuff, but there is no way I can do this without good spreadsheet software optimized for multiple authors. It's view-only with the link, request access if you want to work on it with me. I have made the following semplifications:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>I am\u00a0ignoring the meta level (the network of unMonasteries). Reason: the meta level is what the CheFare grant would pay for.\u00a0We take care of it in <a href=\"/t/che-fare-unmonastery-matera/552/a-tentative-budget\">this document</a>.</li>\n\n<li>I am assuming unMon Matera to be roughly representative of the whole UnMon spectrum, in the sense that (a) yes, all unMonasteries will be different, but (b) the conditions of inventiveness, humbleness, vision and hard work\u00a0for Matera to be viable are more or less the same as for other instantiations. Plenty of instantiations will fail, but if we can make one stay up we will have started to climb the learning curve, just as it was in Monte Cassino for Saint Benedict 14 centuries ago.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Two moves for building sustainability</h3>\n\nNow to the meat.\u00a0\n\nThe strategy towards sustainability in the unMonastery, and depicted in the plan,\u00a0is twofold. One side of the coin is <strong>reducing dependencies from the monetary economy</strong>: obtaining the use of buildings for free,\u00a0growing food, reducing energy consumption etc. A major part of this is that unMonasteries have no employees, but only unBrethren, and therefore no labor costs. unMonasterians spend time and effort, and are compensated by the joy of making meaningful and beautiful thing, and by developing new skills. This is accomplished by:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>for each service,\u00a0estimating\u00a0the money costs that would be incurred by simply buying these services on the market, and writing them down as actual costs.\u00a0For example, if the building would normally\u00a0cost 10K euro a year, I have written \"rent: 18K\"</li>\n\n<li>then, estimating how much of it is saved by using non-market ways of provisioning, and writing these savings down as a revenue.\u00a0For example, in the case of the rent, I have written \"stewardship services: 20K\". This means the city of Matera is letting us use the building for free, foregoing its market revenue, in return for us taking care of the building, opening it to the citizenry and deploying it for public use \u2013 something that the city has neither the money nor the manpower to do. The 2K extra are for small repairs.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThis way of showing things has the advantage of highlighting the many sustainable activities carried out inside an unMonastery, while making explicit \"hidden\" costs like rent.\u00a0\n\nOnce this is done, unMonasteries will still be in the red. Even if they grow most of their own food and produce most of their own energy, they will still need hard cash to meet some necessities. So, they need to produce something that others want\u00a0and exchange it for what they can't produce. I submit that <strong>unMonasteries produce services for Community-Owned Assets (COAs). </strong>These\u00a0could be playgrounds, makerspaces, mesh networks, geodata like OpenStreetMap's (which can be used in <a href=\"/t/geohacking-for-resilient-communities/349\">preparedness for natural disasters</a>). Helping local communities to produce and deploy them is how unMonasteries fit in the social innovation movement.\u00a0Making money out of them would work something like this:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>a prototype is built. The key resource for this is skilled labor by unMonasterians, care of the unMon itself. Additional (cash) inputs could come from grants (like in [Matthias]'s <a href=\"/economy-app\">Economy App</a>), donations or even \u00a0small investments diverted from the unMon's revenue flow. We know from [CommonFutures] that some countries, like the UK have solid\u00a0policies to support this. We expect more countries to follow suit.</li>\n\n<li>once it works, it is demonstrated,\u00a0deployed and maintained.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nExample: farming machines from <a href=\"http://opensourceecology.org/wiki/Main_Page\">OpenSource ecology</a> and other sources. The unMonastery could procure and build, say, a mill, and then turn it over to the near-subsistence farmers in Matera, who have no access to credit. This would give farmers the opportunity to transform some of their produce (wheat to flour, and possibly the famous Matera bread), and selling a higher added value product whereas they are now struggling with the ultralow price imposed by agro-industrial buyers.

Here's an excerpt:\n\n<em>Based on the Future of care session at LOTE4 (the fourth edition of our annual community\n\ngathering), we propose to envision a system of \"care by a community of hackers, armed\n\nwith cheap, open source tools\". This scenario is not a return to the country doctor: we still get\n\nto enlist sensors and algorithms to alert us if an anomaly comes up. But benefits do not come\n\nfrom the artifacts, but from the community that builds, programs and deploys them, and that\n\nanybody can be a part of. Imagine a hackerspace for medicine, where doctors, technologists, and\n\npatients come together to design and deploy the system that best serves their local community; it\n\nwould be resilient, and it would be trustable, because (a) it would be open source and (b)\n\neveryone is a patient sooner or later, so the doctors and the technologists themselves use what\n\nthey build. There are already moves in this direction, like small companies that build medical\n\nsensors for Arduino, and Arduino has decided to fight the Internet of Things, trying to build an\n\nopen source version of it (Massimo Banzi's announcement).</em>\n\nWe have very small chances of winning this (up to 3% in my understanding), but if you are working on something related or would like to get involved, tell us. The consortium we put together is committed to looking for other opportunities too, to work on this project anyway, so any backup is needed, and ideas are welcome.\n\nIf you are trying to setup a proposal where contents from the application would be useful, talk to us. The proposal is a common resource we have, so you could use at least parts of it.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-04-27 13:26:38", "updated_at": "2018-05-24 16:28:19.006005", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 439, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 25.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24797, "user_id": 212, "topic_id": 2553, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>I love it</b>\n\nthank you\n\nMaria\n\n", "created_at": "2014-03-26 11:11:52", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:17.270315", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 12, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [23527], "is_liked_by": [1918], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4714, "user_id": 2872, "topic_id": 4681, "post_number": 1, "raw": "When a common enemy - the Mega Earthquake - struck, we finally saw the spirit of nationalism that almost every Nepali claimed they had in abundance. The pandering politicians finally got on the horse and drafted a constitution, the Nepal Army, Police and Armed Forces went above and beyond their call of duty while conducting rescue operations, and the youths of Nepal sprang into action to help all those in need. Today, almost three months later, this spirit is still seen although it may have lost some of its original drive. But we cannot afford to lose the momentum that has been gathered because Nepal still needs changes \u2013 and an abundance of it. \u00a0\n\nFor me, progress is a secondary step, one that that can only be achieved after people come together for the greater good. The earthquake may have jolted us physically closer but most of us still remain divided in our hearts and minds. If people are not fully committed to achieving a common goal then any progress made will be lost to procrastination, apathy and even sabotage (like it has in the past). Well aimed developmental goals like the Melamchi Water Supply Project or the construction of various hydropower plants have still to show any results because all those involved are on their own singular paths, far away from the cause for the common good. Thus, progress in Nepal, at least for the present, will have to be viewed as successfully building solidarity among the Nepalese and directing them towards a common agenda.\n\nBefore we move on to any herculean task, we must first indulge in small changes, changes that bring us to respect not just this nation of ours but also each other. Such an atmosphere can be built even with small goals like helping in keeping the streets clean, segregating our wastes, abiding by the laws of the land and volunteering our time in orphanages, animal shelters and such. These little things can, over time, generate a sense of bond just as strong as the one created when we, literally, helped clear the rubble of our country - hand in hand - a few months ago.\n\nPolicy makers can help in such causes by continuously monitoring and implementing strict actions, not just to punish the offenders but also to show gratitude towards those citizens who are respectful. Yes, they should hand out tickets and fine those who neglect the rules but they should also issue statements through phones, television and social media and introduce various incentives to thank those who have done their part.\n\n\u00a0I personally think that it would help to see them tackling problems not just with a sense of gusto but also with a sense of playful, tongue-in-cheek humor. How about following in the footsteps of the eccentric former politician of Columbia, Mr. Antana Mockus, who used mimes to control unruly traffic and pedestrians? Stunts like these are fun, encourage bonding and get the job done. During his time as Mayor, Mr. Mockus reduced traffic fatalities to less than half by employing comical silent figures to wag fingers at traffic offenders and give smiling thumbs up to the courteous and abiding citizens. The Nepal government could employ popular actors and comedians \u00a0to do the same on occasions.\n\nApparently, the strongest of bonds are forged either on the face of a common enemy or in the face of shared laughter. While we cannot expect the earth to roar and shake every time we are in need of change, perhaps we can rely on humor to do the trick?\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-20 18:15:44", "updated_at": "2017-09-10 19:46:15.619464", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 610, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 40.8, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856, 2551, 2869], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4966, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4933, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Many important news for those Edgeryders going to 32C3.\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><a href=\"/u/msanti\">@msanti</a>\u00a0(thanks!) has decided to <a href=\"/t/edgeryders-goes-to-32c3-and-you-can-come-too/4910/11\">support hostel accommodation for two more people</a>, bringing the provisional total of Edgeryders at 32C3 to 12.

If I remember correctly he was generally relatively neutral on these issues in his academic writing (though I admit I am not terribly familiar with his works). What I would want to warn you of is that he seemed to have used the word \"Herrscher\", which wikipedia translates as \"authority\". This is not wrong but it is a slightly more general category, I believe <a href=\"http://dict.leo.org/ende/index_de.html#/search=herrscher&amp;searchLoc=0&amp;resultOrder=basic&amp;multiwordShowSingle=on\">closer to the original</a> would be \"ruler\" or \"lord\" (as in \"lord and master\"). On a general note, I would not look to Germany for a useful cue on leadership. A leadership focused way of running things has run up a <em>really</em> bad track record (there are very notable exceptions - but they don't even come close to balancing this). Merkel is a nice example of non-leadership I could talk more about. But the short form is that when Germany runs a half-assed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_democracy\">consensus democracy</a> things tend to work out much better (again, in my view). Merkel just lends a necessary face for the whole thing.\n\nRegarding leaders in other cultural contexts (and since you rolled out the big guns) - if you like to read a lot you may want to have a look at Toynbee.\n\nThere is again a \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Decline_of_the_West#Democracy.2C_media.2C_and_money\">German version</a>\", which is considerably shorter, but I have serious issues with the language and some other things. It is so much shorter though that I would almost recommend it, and he does have a few things to say on leaders as well.\n\nPersonally, if I had the time, I would probably start digging deeper in the directions of the \"<a href=\"http://www.people.vcu.edu/~mamcdani/Publications/O%27Boyle%20et%20al%20%282012%20JAP%20-%20Dark%20Triad%29.pdf\">dark triad</a>\" and <a href=\"https://scholar.google.no/citations?hl=en&amp;user=P4nfoKYAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">Sandy Pentlands</a> pertinent works, bottom up.

Ho iniziato con le politiche sociali, da consulente di una Provincia e una Regione relativamente a finanziamenti nazionali utilizzati a livello provinciale nei Distretti socio sanitari, e poi avendo avuto l\u2019opportunit\u00e0 di lavorare con Fondazioni, ho continuato anche in altri settori attigui come sanit\u00e0 e cultura. Ho seguito e seguo, a fini di monitoraggio e valutazione, progetti che valgono tantissimo sia dal punto di vista economico che dal punto di vista delle novit\u00e0 che introducono nei sistemi complessi in cui vanno ad intervenire. E insieme a questo aspetto, c\u2019\u00e8 quello altrettanto importante per me, che tutto questo sono riuscito a farlo in modo indipendente insieme ad alcuni selezionatissimi compagni di viaggio che con me hanno condiviso il rischio di puntare su qualche cosa di nuovo, che non c\u2019era prima, da costruire sulla base degli input che la nostra esperienza ci metteva a disposizione man mano. In particolare parlo di un sistema informativo che mettesse a regime tutta l\u2019esperienza fatta in ambito di monitoraggio e valutazione dal punto di vista metodologico, cercando di combinare il rigore del metodo con la statistica e l\u2019informatica, al fine di fornire a chi ne fosse interessato uno strumento in grado di supportare la governance di grandi progetti (pubblica o privata) con uno strumento di condivisione utile a seguire l\u2019iter delle iniziative dall\u2019inizio alla fine, di stoccare dati che diventano nel corso di iniziative lunghe e complesse patrimonio dimostrativo dello sforzo di tutti i soggetti coinvolti, di valutare scostamenti in tempo reale rispetto alle previsioni e di valutare il processo e l\u2019esito di finanziamenti enormi che altrimenti non lascerebbero nulla dal punto di vista della sedimentazione a chi viene dopo e non permetterebbero di sapere se chi c\u2019\u00e8 oggi a decidere abbia deciso bene e perseguito veramente l\u2019interesse pubblico. Tutto questo lo stiamo realizzando in totale autonomia e senza alcuna certezza in merito a cosa il futuro ci far\u00e0 trovare davanti a noi in termini di opportunit\u00e0 in una nazione in cui le opportunit\u00e0 per le buone idee innovative spesso non \u00e8 cos\u00ec scontata, e vorremmo portare la nostra esperienza in tutti quei luoghi in cui c\u2019\u00e8 qualcuno che pensa che valga la pensa rischiare incertezze e insuccessi pur di avere una soddisfazione cos\u00ec grande come quella che abbiamo avuto noi, quando una importantissima istituzione privata italiana ci ha scelti sulla base di una gara vera, intuendo le potenzialit\u00e0 del nostro sistema on line, le sue non rigidit\u00e0, le sue aperture e opportunit\u00e0, le sue finalit\u00e0 di condivisione a fini realmente valutativi e ci ha dato la possibilit\u00e0 di metterlo in pratica in un contesto sovralocale in una Regione su 6 maxi progetti in 5 province tutti legati da un filo unico comune che \u00e8 quello del rapporto tra le eccellenze territoriali e la nuova imprenditorialit\u00e0.

They would be innovative, fairly priced and an integral part of their local community. They would be great places to work, and run for the benefit of all, not to maximize profit or subject to the whims of governments. That\u2019s our dream.\u00a0\n\nA bit of background: The care industry in the UK is in crisis (the BBC recently called it the problem no one can fix). \u00a0It is a familiar story.\u00a0 The <span>demand</span> for care is growing rapidly due mainly to an ageing population, with increasingly complex conditions, a breaking down of traditional community-provided care, and higher expectations amongst the elderly.\n\nAt the same time, the <span>ability</span> of government-funded institutions to meet those needs is diminishing. They lack the resources, the responsiveness and the political will to deal with the population\u2019s increasingly complex care needs.\n\nAt the same, escalating asset prices are putting pressure on traditional providers, and attracting hedge funds and private equity looking for the \"growth opportunities\u201d. \u00a0The result is that many care home are being run as a businesses more than as a service, meaning that profit and shareholder value is prioritised over the needs and well-being of residents or staff.\n\nCaring for Life is a diverse team has come together to seek a better solution. We are inspired by:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>open source communities, that harness collective intelligence to find new solutions to old problems;</li>\n\n<li>networked organisations, notably Buurtzorg, the community care provider in the Netherlands, that combine the benefits of being small with the benefits of being part of something large.</li>\n\n<li>traditional community-based approaches to care-giving that are human-centred and sustainable.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nWe intend to will achieve this in particular by taking over existing care home businesses and creating, one-by-one, a network of homes modelling the type of care we want to see. \u00a0Once we have established a small number of our own homes, we will reach out to other like-minded operators to create a broader community of homes around the UK.\n\nA key operating principle will be to involve all \"stakeholders\".\u00a0 Buurtzorg (mentioned above) has an excellent model, illustrating the various levels of involvement, and whilst this is primarily looking at <strong>home care</strong> as opposed to <strong>care homes</strong>, it is a useful way of viewing the bigger picture.\n\nCare home residents come into care with social networks, habits, routines and pastimes, which are normally stripped away on entering care. As far as possible these should be maintained because these are part of the person's \"support system\". Involving the family and friends as well as the wider community will, whilst it may add to the complexity, lighten the burden of care and increase quality of life for all affected.\n\n<strong>Legal structure:</strong>\u00a0 Our intention is to separate out the capital assets from the business of caring. The precise legal structure remains to be worked out but may be similar to a so-called community land trust (see <a href=\"http://www.communitylandtrusts.org.uk/what-is-a-clt/about-clts\">http://www.communitylandtrusts.org.uk/what-is-a-clt/about-clts</a>) where one organisation (maybe a charity) owns the freehold of the land and a social enterprise runs the care home. \u00a0There would be some element of employee ownership, which has been shown in many businesses to encourage higher than average levels of productivity and profitability.\n\n<strong>Getting started:\u00a0 </strong>Our intent is to start by acquiring control of one care home.\u00a0 In order to keep capital needs as low as possible in the early stages, the intention is to lease premises on a long-term lease rather than buying a home. An opportunity has been identified near the south coast of England and conversations have started with the owners.\u00a0 This is an interesting opportunity, in particular because there is an chance to acquire the property and business for a low price.\u00a0 The home is currently subject to \"special measures\u201d, imposed by the Care Quality Commission.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-20 15:57:34", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 08:09:08.352432", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 727, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 757, "user_id": 3067, "topic_id": 724, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<em>\u2018What people experiencing mental health difficulties need most is to be shown compassion, empathy, a voice, to be listened to, to be believed in, somewhere to go where they will be given hope of a more meaningful life.\u2019</em>\n\nCos\u00e1in Community Wellness is a recent\u00a0initiative to develop a peer-led community-based support system for people with emotional distress and mental health issues, and to promote wellness for all. Cos\u00e1in is the Irish word for \u2018pathways', reflecting our belief in different paths not single roads, and the guidance, wisdom and support that we can find in the stories of each others individual journeys. All quotes within this article are from research performed by Galway Mental Health Services Consumer Panel, the local representative body of mental health service users for the geographic region.\n\nGMHSCP advocates for supports and services which are fit for purpose from the perspective of service users, and the integration of users of services into the design, \u00a0development and delivery of services, working in partnership with the Irish Health Services (HSE) based on the value of our lived experience of current systems of care, and the evidence of our own healing processes.\n\n<em>\u2018The most effective help I have experienced over the years, having had years of medication, psychotherapy, hospitalisation, is the support of peers, where I am treated as normal, with kindness, not judged, and not expected to conform to the medical model of treatment.\u2019</em>\n\nWhere progress was slow or absent within the system, we took\u00a0it upon ourselves to prototype and demonstrate how necessary supports could be delivered in partnership and collaboration between health providers, community groups, and local authorities based on a cooperative ethos of mutual support. We believe our approach will be of value and benefit because\n\n\u2018it's a community based project concerned with 'well-being' which is preparing fertile ground for the empowerment and transformation of people, individually and as a group. It's organic growth reflects the personalities and desires of the people involved, making it of and for the people.\u2019\n\nOur belief is that properly resourced and equipped communities can provide more effective intervention in cases of crisis,\u00a0care in a more person-centred and human manner, and both at a lower cost than the dominant acute-oriented, clinical and biomedical approaches. We believe that only approaches that are grounded in local communities and emerge from their dreams and aspirations\u00a0can meet the needs which we are presented with in the time that we have.\n\n<em>\u2018My experience of large organisations is that the individual gets lost in the system and become just another number\u2026 I\u2019m sick and tired of waiting for the HSE to offer people the support they want\u2019</em>\n\nWe also believe that the act of mutual support is amongst the most therapeutic of acts, transforming relationships from ones of being a recipient and subject of care, to a space of\u00a0autonomy, collective development, peer provision and mutual reliance that involves people in generating their own solutions.\n\n<em>\u2018Being with people who are doing whatever we can to have our lives the way we want them, seeing the evidence that people can succeed, that we can make a difference \u2013 all this has a positive effect on my own mental health, self-esteem and my ability to shape my life the way I want it.\u2019</em>\n\n<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-ca86e309-481c-9e44-82da-de66b1b3215a\">We developed our initiative over the course of the Galway 2020 Bid process, using \u00a0participatory design exercises that brought together a range of groups and individuals including\u00a0independent therapists,\u00a0health professionals, service users and patients,\u00a0and other interested parties who are seeking to develop new models of community-based health promotion and care.\u00a0</b>We then used the blank canvas of a disused city building, visioning and combining elements of artspace, green makerspace, and wellness supports that were brought together using the concept of an\u00a0integrated cultural and community hub. During this time we came into contact with EdgeRyders and the Opencare research project, and welcomed the opportunity to form productive partnerships at European level with groups and initiatives with similar ethos.\n\n<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-ca86e309-481c-9e44-82da-de66b1b3215a\">Our current operating model exists with the support of Galway City Museum, who have provided us with the use of a room one day a week for prototyping and co-design. </b>This is taking place as part of the Galway City Cultural Strategy, which seeks to use \u00a0cultural resources and infrastructure for wellness supports and public health.\u00a0These sessions were an extension of the earlier co-design process, deployed in a real-life environment for feedback from stakeholders and re-design. Our sessions to date have included artistic and creative process, peer support and educational sessions, based on the demand from service users.\u00a0\n\nCurrently delivered on a volunteer basis for proof of concept, our intent is to progress towards a cultural space and \u2018crisis cafe\u2019 on a social enterprise model, with a welcoming cafe-type front-of-house drop-in space that can be used as an open studio and learning space, with a supportive backstage of more intensive interventions, therapies and supports for those people in emotional distress. Our model is grounded in the value and authenticity of provision of supports and services that are delivered by people with the direct personal experience of the situations in question, and the expressed need based on our research for appropriate creative outlets that support emotional wellbeing and generate meaning and community for the participants.\n\n<em>\u2018in Irish culture mental health tends to be seen as a failing by an individual, of an individual, in an individual. This attitude views the natural processes of emotional distress and recovery through a lens of pathology, individualised blame, guilt and shame.\u00a0In contrast, rather than attempt to seek what Zygmunt Bauman called \u2018individual solutions to collective problems\u2019, an impossible task, we felt the need for the sake of our collective sanity, to use an approach based on collective support and interdependence.</em>\n\nOur story is just beginning.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-20 15:54:04", "updated_at": "2017-10-06 13:41:16.297306", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1093, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 91.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25907, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4643, "post_number": 16, "raw": "<b>Thanks!

We only met Ecobytes later: <a href=\"/u/matthias\">@Matthias</a> has decided that a migration was not worth the investment. Perhaps we will take the chance of the next major overhaul of the website to migrate.\n\nAs an \"advanced Muggle\" (don't develop, can code a little for data manipulation purposes, but not afraid of learning to use tools), I would like to throw in my point of view in this super-interesting discussion, and see what you guys think \u2013 that means also <a href=\"/u/darren\">@Darren</a>, <a href=\"/u/mstn\">@mstn</a> and <a href=\"/u/trythis\">@trythis</a>.\n\nThere are two types of extended functionalities: those that are linked to a cultural change (normally the relationship is not one-way: they <em>require</em> cultural change, but at the same time they <em>induce </em>it too), and those that don't. A markdown editor does not require cultural change, as long as it can be added to WYSIWYG as an extra option; so each person can use the editor she prefers. Getting people to really use wikis, or issue tracking functionalities, or crypto, that's another story. The power of those tools are in people using them <em>together and at the same time;</em> even within a small community like ours, their value increases superlinearly with the number of users. No point using encrypted mail if none of your friends can receive an encrypted message!\n\nI propose that any tool being rolled out within Edgeryders \u2013 if it is connected with cultural change \u2013 should come with an explicit effort to (1) explain to the community why they should care about the tool and (2) campaign tirelessly for adoption, over a sustained period of time. By \"explicit\" here I mean this: that one or more people take personal responsibility for leading the effort.\n\nWhen <a href=\"/u/msanti\">@msanti</a>, <a href=\"/u/danohu\">@danohu</a> and I, at 31C3, fell in love with the Community Crypto idea, the deal was this: they (the geeks) would offer technical support to any edgeryder wanting to embrace it. I would write the instructable, act as alpha tester (if I can do it, anyone can!) and promote community crypto corners at all Edgeryders events. I would be the adoption champion.\n\nThat project is stagnating because we could not get Mailpile to work with the edgeryders.eu SMTP server, despite much banging our heads on the wall and pleading with the Mailpile development team (I recently saw that the blog seems to be active again, so maybe there is more hope now). But I stand for the approach: I would hate to waste precious developer time to roll out tools that no one uses... what does everyone think?\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-15 19:51:11", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:23.012983", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 534, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 16.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [25850], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4511, "user_id": 2554, "topic_id": 4478, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<em>A year or two ago, Milan Rai was able to capture the imagination of people (both in Nepal and abroad) with his <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AnArtistConvertingTheCityToButterfly?fref=ts\">White Butterflies</a>, a whimsical art project that called for people to believe in the power of simplicity, and imagination.

The first thing I did was go to a safe space and started to ask everyone around me to calm down as well. After that, I cycled around the city searching for a way to help but ended up very confused. When I went to Tudikhel, people were in terror due to the frequent aftershocks. So, I came back and packed a backpack \u2013 I put water, fruits, and a whistle \u2013 and wrote a Facebook status: \u201cEveryone, go to a safe space with a backpack full of food and water. Share this with as many people as possible.\u201d With this, I posted a photo of my backpack and went to Tudikhel where I started to request people to stay calm.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/35d6b4e7c729f676f4472310ae92c2b539f28df7.jpg\" width=\"281\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\n<strong>The Night of the Big Quake</strong>\n\nI ended up in an open space in Baneshwork and while I was telling people that there would be no bigger aftershocks, the tremors continued! I was also scared but I continued to work. I saw a lot of people using their mobile phones and updating their statuses. Then, I saw updates from Teaching Hospital. Graphic images of mass casualties were being posted over there so I decided to go there to help out instead of staying in the space because people who never spoke with each other were also starting to speak to each other.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c0f737335743163664422985216a3d665ac6088b.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\nFrom beggars to the rich, everyone were there together \u2013 I was very happy. At 3 am, I cycled all the way to the hospital. I became more confused, and almost went insane. I felt helpless. I went there again at 8 am, and then we set up help desks in collaboration with the volunteers, Max (another initiator), and <a href=\"/t/preparedness-goes-a-really-long-way/4460\">Bibeksheel Nepali</a>. I did not know what I wanted to do still but I knew I would do whatever came to me, so I would just open doors of an ambulance and carrying stretchers.\n\n<strong>Setting up Temporary Toilets</strong>\n\nWe saw a lot of people in the public spaces where they were camping but there were no toilets. Especially the girls complained that they had to wait for the night in order to relieve themselves. We realized that if we were unable to tackle this issue then this would be the source of epidemic outbreak. There was no option to become sick at this hour where everyone is needed to serve the humanity. Me and my friend, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/%E0%A4%88%E0%A4%83/1673366709560539?ref=profile\">Ishaan</a> had gone to do a field survey at Tudikhel and decided to set up 100 temporary toilets in a day!\n\n<strong>How can you be so kind?</strong>\n\nPeople keep asking me, \u201cMilan, how can you be so kind?\u201d But kindness is natural, how can you be so unkind because that is so unnatural! That is so man-made. That is more difficult \u2013 to pretend, and pretend. People were very emotionally charged during that time. We did not have much preparation regarding disaster response. I even heard that without waiting for orders, armies went out to help. Where did it come from? That is an inborn quality.\n\n<strong>Dignity Along with Hygiene</strong>\n\nWe thought that temporary toilets were not only about public health, hygiene and sanitation but also about the dignity and self-esteem of the people. Even an enclosed space with tarpaulin and bamboo would provide them with that. The tarpaulin cost us 21,000 but since we did not have that much money, I waited clutching the tarp while my friend went to look for the money. The shopkeeper kept telling me to give money otherwise he would sell it to someone else but I just held on to the tarp.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a503954ea1857e581af4a314f1d21be244ff6180.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\"><br>\n\nIt started to rain when we reached Tudikhel with the tarp and bamboo. We only had two gardening tools but our aim was to build 100 toilets and none of us had even broken a stick! Then, we tweeted and posted in Facebook. I went looking for some tools in the army barrack but they told us that most of their tools were taken in the relief work and they did not even trust us. When I came back, there were already 15-20 volunteers gathered after the tweets and updates. I was so happy! A team was formed. After buying three shovels from our own money, we started to (poorly) start digging. The armies saw us doing this and told us, \u201cWe are ashamed of ourselves because actually, this should have been our responsibility. Oxfam has actually given us tools to do so. But we haven\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f7918e06c32d04dbc0c0963ca6563d6ce6967db4.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\"><br>\n\nThe volunteers complained that the army were lazy and that girls dug more than them. So, I told them that the army and police have always been doing so much, they have rescued so many people and dug out so many dead bodies that they must be so tired. So, it is our duty to help them. \u201cYou have to work from that place of compassion.\u201d\n\nThey helped us build around 20 toilets and by the night, we were to able to build 47 toilets.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f8c61f21e40218938a4e4a99ceceb40c5b372fca.jpg\" width=\"669\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\n<strong>Social Media Magic </strong>\n\nSo, we returned to our places. I finally decided to active my Facebook account because I realized this was helping direct volunteers to different relief efforts. I updated my status and slept. When I woke up the day after, there were 1300 shares, 1500 shares and in total 4000 shares of my update. From my White Butterfly page, there were almost 900 shares. My inbox was about to explode! It was uncontrollable. My mobile was ringing non-stop! Donation pledges started to flood in. When I added all those pledges, it reached almost 48 Lakh! But I did not need all that money. Neither was I trying to collect fund nor was I the Prime Minister\u2019s relief fund! I wanted to show the power of team work. Our volunteers have put their own money into this. So I started to only take personal contributions because this was participatory and organic.\n\n<em>This conversation is Part I of the conversation Milan and I had while sipping some cold tea. Currently, he and his team is out there in the field, building toilets and distributing seeds to the people.

I've reached out to them privately, as well, in the hopes of keeping more lines of communication open for collaboration.\n\nWhat if the health resource centre you are building could have a distributed presence (and network of contributors) as a compliment to the physical space itself? And how could a community support the developers working on it?\n\nI don't know if this was directed at me, but I wanted to chime in anyway because it's a great idea that showcases the best kind of melding between the Internet's ability to cross geographical boundaries and the real need (often overlooked by head-in-the-clouds technologists) for having physical-world networks of people in close proximity to one another.\n\nOne of the things I would like to see Buoy as a project develop more of as time goes on are tools for getting knowledge/skill dissemination (similar to what the Woodbine folks spoke of) in a \"point-of-need\" manner. By this I mean being able to forward or relay calls for help that require particular skills to the people who have those skills even if those people are not immediately known by the person in crisis. This is actually one reason why I envision Buoy primarily as a logistical and coordination support tool for existing volunteer-run community health or support groups, rather than a kind of individualistic technological solutionism proferred by these \"there's an app for that!\" product marketing campaigns.\n\nThere are already <a href=\"https://github.com/betterangels/buoy/issues/32\">tickets in our issue tracker for allowing Buoy users to add things like skills listings to their profiles</a>, but we have so far only prioritized the things that real users are actually telling us that they need. Since, for now, most users know one another and what their skills are well already, we haven't done any of this. But it's something to think about in terms of growing a user base across more geographically disperse regions.\n\nAnother thought with respect to a more \"distributed presence\" is that it's also possible for a group (such as Woodbine) to host an instane of the Buoy software but invite other groups to make use of it, even if they are not near the Woodbine clinic itself. Buoy has no geographic limitations itself (it uses OpenStreetMaps for geographical data, which covers almost the entire planet), and a single instance's use is only limited by who is actually using it.\n\nOn that note, I am already working in collaboration with the Glocal Coop as a contributor to their <a href=\"http://glocal.coop/activist-network-platform/\">Activist Network Platform</a> (ANP). This is a tool that allows larger organizations such as groups with national presence and individual regional chapters to produce a network of related websites. We are discussing the possibility of adding Buoy as a default or an optional add-on to that ANP. If this happens, it would offer opportunities for cross-Buoy technical integration that could be very valuable, too.\n\nAs for \"how could a community support the developers working on it?\" I hear this question as mostly asking about money and so on, but I'd like to point out that the most progress that has been made on Buoy happened during times when I was sleeping in a friend's closet on my sleeping pad. If I am able to nurture friendships with fellow activists who are able to shelter and possibly feed me, who are willing to try experimenting with the tools I write, I make much more sustained progress on a tool. Money helps, of course, but ultimately I spent all money that I gete on food and shelter anyway, so if I can get reliable food and shelter directly, what use have I for money?\n\nAnother member of the community who might be interested in this is <a href=\"/u/eireann_leverett\">@Eireann Leverett</a> who does information security and has experience with tech-related privacy/security issues which is a concern.\n\nI took a look at Eireann's profile and what piqued my interest was the line \"He likes teaching the basics, and learning the obscure.\" I feel similar, and I would love the opportunity to skillshare/collaborate with more folks with that mindset who have an interest in various infosec disciplines.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-08-15 22:58:30", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:06.080698", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 840, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 1.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [8632], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1438, "user_id": 102, "topic_id": 1405, "post_number": 1, "raw": "What is family? This is both a question that is hard to answer, but equally quite easy; it depends on how you approach it. Quite a lot of people still see family in the given Husband, Wife, Kids in a family house, with a pet or whatever, making ends meet, educating each other and growing alonside each other experiencing life. The nuclear family as it were - is this sort of life achieveable for young people now, and is it something that is still desirable?\n\nI admit that inside me somewhere is a 1950s housewife that wants this sort of life, but the world is a very different place for people of my age (32)\u00a0and younger as what a family means is becoming very different with subtle shifts in relationships and how people live. It's not beyond the realms of possibility but for me to have this life I would have to move home (about 300 miles due north) and certainly put professional goals aside to achieve this, and I think that is why the very concept of family is changing.\n\nFor people younger than myself, a lot will have gone through education, moved away from home to go to university, and perhaps settled in the city they went to university in, or moved to another city to begin a career - it is rare that people will move back to their birth home after university, but it does happen on occasion. With this geographical move, people create their own strong friendships in a way to create their own family/support unit/call it what you will - I know that certainly is something that I have done. As a city dweller, the idea of the nuclear family seems something of an alien concept. If I were to have a family of my own, any children that came from this would almost certainly have a much wider concept of family as I have many wonderful friends who would add so much to the quality of life of any children, let alone the life of myself and any partner I had.\n\nWhy is the idea of a nuclear family strange for a young city dweller like myself? I think it comes down to housing and money. I know that I will never be able to afford a house on my own. My family home was bought outright before I was born for \u00a326,000. A family home, even in the town I grew up in, you are now looking at quadruple that price, and with wages dropping, banks not willing to back mortgages, and the rental market seemingly being an inescapable trap for most young people - the idea of family changes. Whilst relationships change and grow, our financial and geographical status may not.\n\nAway from the housing and financial aspects of what family means - why would family life be different to the one I grew up in? I live a much more alternative lifestyle than my parents did, and whilst they were very open to my alternative nature growing up, they were working class people who didn't want as much from life as I did. They wanted to raise their kids right (which they did), have the occasional holiday (yup) and go to the pub with their friends (yes). I would see my family life as a different thing, and would want as many of my friends involved as possible as they would bring a different angle on things - a much more varied point of view. The nuclear family doesn't exist in my mind as the family I have created for myself since leaving home is too great to not have an involvement in where I go from here on in, and I believe a lot of people would think in a similar way. As the world changes, so will relationships. As people move away from what they've always known, communities will be shaped differently. Young people see this and they won't be guided to create an old fashioned model (as politicians are so often found to espouse the moralities of!) if it doesn't fit their lives.\n\nI, for one, will continue to build my family in whatever way I see fit, and not to some model that doesn't work for me. I am sure it does for quite a lot of people, but to look forward, we need to accept\u00a0and encourage\u00a0all kinds of family situations and relationships, otherwise we will stay in a past that is not working.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-12 10:07:59", "updated_at": "2017-11-13 18:19:00.912721", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 770, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 16.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7965, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1269, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>What is a leader?</b>\n\nI continue sharing my thoughts about 'HOW TO DRIVE CHANGE'.

What can help me improve my leadership skills? What are the new models of leadership?\n\nWhile I pondered these questions, I received a video from Lolly Daskal. It allowed me to see how she puts into practice that she advocates, a heart based model of leadership. She celebrated the New Year with a blog post and a video highlighting all the members of the Lead from within community. She include me in the video (I'm honored). <a href=\"http://t.co/A8D0WXaW\">http://t.co/A8D0WXaW</a>\n\n[You can read all transcripts of Lead from within chats, on Twitter every Tuesday night: <a href=\"http://www.lollydaskal.com/leadfromwithin/\">http://www.lollydaskal.com/leadfromwithin/</a>]\n\nThis reference might be dating a little, but it's good organizational strategies for new leadership: Cufaude, J. B. (2001). <em>Telling a new leadership story</em>. Association Management.\n\nAlso, Joseph Kennedy\u2019s 2010 article, <em>Empowering Future Organizational Leaders for the 21st Century</em> highlighted Mark Popovich\u2018s <em>High Performance Structures,</em> which encourages organisations to set aside bureaucracies and embrace flexibility and innovation at all levels. Kennedy, J. W. (2010). Empowering future organizational leaders for the 21st century. <em>The International Business &amp; Economics Research Journal.</em>\n\nAccording to there references, leaders are...\n\n- <strong>CHAOS EMBRACERS</strong>. Most humans are conditioned for order, control and predictability. This blinds many from the truth: chaos is healthy, creativity, opportunity. Chaos is life reordering itself. \"New\" leaders are creators of chaos, just as much as originators of order. They engage the optimists as well as the pessimists. By stirring the pot, leaders stimulate possible breakthroughs in creativity and innovation.\n\n- <strong>WOW! INJECTORS</strong>. Leaders create or champion projects that add value and make a difference. When people are involved in these types of projects, they feel rejuvenated, personally challenged. They feel they can accomplish something useful, and they believe that their input matters.\n\n- <strong>FACILITATORS</strong>. Leaders ask the obvious and even the un-askable questions. They clarify roles of each teammate, responsibilities, and expectations. They provide closure around decisions. Facilitator are skilled at helping everyone in a group express their leadership qualities. They help things go smoothly without imposing their own ideas upon everyone else. Negotiators are skilled facilitators. These are leaders committed to serve others as servant-leaders and stewards. They adhere to a number of basic qualities, like democracy, responsibility, cooperation, honesty. Facilitators challenge thinking. They help a group create lists of important points. They summarize the issues from time to time. They share ideas when they can help meeting progress. They raise quesions to bring out different viewpoints. They guide discussions, but do not lead them.\n\n- <strong>PARTNERS AND COLLABORATORS</strong>. Effective partnership and collaboration requires a set of skills that differ from those traditionnally sought for leadership positions. Partners and collaborators are strong listeners, communication conduits, boundary breakers, possibly thinkers, and honest negociators.\n\n- <strong>TALENT SCOUT AND DEVELOPER</strong>. These leaders expect a return on talent. These are alpha scouts who lead the pack. It is the woman or man who people want to work for, and they see an association with this person as pre-path to better opportunities. Over time, as the scout methods evolve from turning over rocks looking for talent, talented resources begin to gravitate with him/her. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n- <strong>FUTURISTS</strong>. They regularly scan the environment for trends on the immediate and long-term horizons. Leaders are aware that trends might have strong implications for the organization and its members. They understand that the future is something they can contribute to shape as active participants. They utilize the idea that beings help to create their own realities (based on quantum physics theories).\n\n- <strong>CLARITY CREATORS</strong>. They are vigilant communicators. They send messages that help bring clarity and order.\n\n- <strong>VALUE CHAMPIONS</strong>. Values help build a common focus and set of norms. Leaders help anchor individual and community efforts in the organization's core values and function. They focus to ensure the organization knows itself as well as possible.\n\n- <strong>PASSIONATE PLAYERS</strong>. The Persian poet Rumi wrote, \u201cthe longing is the answer\u201d. Leaders that are passionate about their roles and contributions are as interested as learning about the passions that others possess as their own. They effectively match others passions for projects and put them in appropriate leadership positions. \"When anything comes from the heart - any energy, any action - it comes with a passion that is unstoppable.\" (Anita Roddick, Body Shop founder)\n\n- <strong>STORYTELLERS</strong>. Stories and metaphors enhance individual retention and learning. Storytelling is an important element for leaders hoping to create new realities, when they relate their experience to current challenges. A storyteller might reflect on an experience during an earlier stage of his/her career. Effective stories include drama: an incident that challenged ethics for instance, something that explains a need to make tough choices (usually without perfect information, or the complete alignement), etc.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI am sure there are many other skills and qualities that leaders might want to develop. I set my mind to continue to explore.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-04 17:34:57", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:46.311702", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 958, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1791, "user_id": 4922, "topic_id": 1758, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"imagecache-Featured\" src=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/sites/edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/files/imagecache/Featured/by_dianecordell_at_flickr.com_.jpg\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:5px; margin-right:5px\" title=\"Photo by dianecorrdell at flickr.com\"><em>Resilience is a measure of a community's or a society's ability to adapt to sudden changes in ecological or social circumstances, while still retaining its social and material functions. A society that relies only on one supply of food or energy has little resilience since they would be in trouble if that one resource became inaccessible. On the other hand, a society that relies on multiple, locally produced food sources and gets its energy for several sources is less vulnerable to changes. Diversity, the ability to transform relations and habits and how well connected a community is are key factors to increased resilience.</em>\n\nThere is a growing awareness of the lack of resilience in our societies and growing efforts to increase resilience on the local and global level. Especially our <strong>dependence on oil </strong>has been highlighted as a growing concern. We have gone from a time where access to fossil fuels in the form of oil and gas were the key factor for success and well being, to a time where our dependency on the same are a measure of our vulnerability. Oil is a finite resource and research indicate that we have reached maximum possible world production of oil at the same time as the demand for more oil is increasing with growing economies. Increases in the price of oil and conflicts around oil resources are likely to increase as the demand rises.\n\nSocieties and individuals can come under strain in ways other than an absolute scarcity of resources. One area that we see problems is <strong>financial resilience</strong>, as the banks and insurance companies which help to run our economies come into danger as the bets they made about the\n\nfuture fail to work. The knock-on effects of the financial crisis are making entire generations question their values, and this is a different problem from the resource constraints around natural resources and environmental sustainability. What does it mean to be resilient to shocks which shake your entire society?\n\nInitiatives for <strong>community resilience</strong> such as <u><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_Towns\">Transition Towns</a></u> tries to show how ecological and energy systems are connected with social and economical systems. In order to increase our resilience in the former, we have to also change social relations and economic systems.\n\n<strong>Information and knowledge.</strong> The new cultural models of production as an alternative to traditional markets, increase resilience: production is low-cost and decentralized, with individuals having major and critical input in the process, as opposed to being passive consumers (among the theorists see <u><a href=\"http://blog.ted.com/2008/04/16/yochai_benkler_1/\">Yochai Benkler</a></u> or <u><a href=\"http://heroesandhobos.org/2012/04/19/a-blueprint-for-p2p-peer-to-peer-society-the-partner-state-ethical-economy/\">Michel Bauwens</a></u>).\n\nResilience need to happen on multiple levels but it is often the grassroots initiatives that are driving the change. We want to find out what initiatives you Edgeryders are involved in and how you feel about these issues and our societies\u2019 ability to respond to the challenges.\n\nHelp the Council of Europe and the European Commission think about what works best for future resilience, in new ways, and come up with innovative policies.

If you are good at it, you can engage with lots of interesting people and projects with very limited investment; you simply get more opportunities than if you are not. Occasionally, you can partake or even create \"smart swarms\" of a great many people, that turn out to be incredibly effective at certain tasks.\n\nSurprisingly few people are good at it, even in an age of digital natives.\n\nBeing good at online collaboration does NOT come down to using software \u2013 though using software is definitely important. Online collaboration environments are complex creatures made of humans that interact over technology and social protocols. Getting the social protocols right is the hard part: the very many empty collaborative platforms littering the landscape are the result of their creators focusing on the tech and ignoring the humans. In this session, we discuss and practice online collaboration with the goal of making each one of us better at it by sharing our experiences.\n\nWe focus on making the most from information and other intellectual input contributed by people collaborating. To this end, we spell out\u00a0 characteristics we want such information to have, and suggest tools for ensuring it does. <strong>We also try these tools out: this is a hands-on session</strong>. We will run a practical collaborative exercise, documenting the session itself as part of the <a href=\"/t/the-unmonasterians-cookbook-recipes-for-bridging-the-gap-between-making-a-living-and-making-meaning/1058\">CookBook</a>. We shall argue information generated during collaboration can be fruitful (and seed further collaboration) if it is:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>retrievable</strong>, so we look at permalinks, SEO and metadata.</li>\n\n<li><strong>accessible</strong>, so we look at permission structures (open vs. closed collaboration).</li>\n\n<li><strong>reusable</strong>, so we look at data structures and licensing.</li>\n\n<li><strong>inclusive</strong>, so we look at special needs users might have.</li>\n\n<li><strong>safe</strong>, so we look at moderation policy and leadership in swarms and other unstructured groups.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nWe use the Edgeryders platform as the context of the session. Why is is the way it is? Does it work? To do what? How could it be improved?\n\nDepending on the interest of Drupal-skilled people, we could add a session in which we, together, tweak the Edgeryders platform according to the results of this session to make it better suited to collaboration for the community.\n\nThis session is led by <a href=\"/u/alberto\">Alberto Cottica</a>, designer and manager of online communities for over 15 years (yes, it started with mailing lists in the 1990s). It is loosely based on the mini-course in online collaboration given by Alberto at the Master in Design For Social Business at Istituto Europeo di Design in Milano in 2011; and <a href=\"/u/noemi\">Noemi Salantiu</a>, community healer at Edgeryders. A tentative schedule:\n\n<strong>Lecture (Alberto)</strong> \u2013 Online collaboration: how to design it, how to participate in it, how to evolve it. Specifically, we look at Google Docs, Google Groups, blogs, online fora. GitHub (45 mins).\n\n<strong>Break</strong> (15 mins)\n\n<strong>Workshop</strong> <strong>(Dorotea)</strong>: the Edgeryders software and community as a platform for collaboration; we then use it to collaborate in documenting our session as a contribution to the Edgeryders cookbook.\u00a0 (45 mins)\n\nBringing laptops is desirable, but not mandatory.

I've been into object manipulation and geometric physico-spatial explorations for a little over ten or eleven years now also. I'll attend the sessions as you set them out happily, if you want to collaborate let me know. (still I know how short 90-minute sessions\u00a0are\u00a0for this kind of thing)\n\n@Ariane Conrad, I've even skill shared with and hosted workshops with\u00a0some of your hooper crew (Spiral, Brecken, Ann Humphreys, Rico and a few more), all beautiful people, and powerfully skillful, I love that stuff!\n\nThe body/breath stuff is inherently non-verbal in its consistent practice. This is the best thing about it and also the functional key to it. The verbal is symbolic, and the symbol is not the thing in itself, but a representation. This is why we practice, it dissolves the gap between the symbolic and the essential in such a way as to open the direct experience to the living flow.\u00a0\n\nThe old words, inspiration and exspiration, are what we now refer to as inhale exhale, but at a deeper level of awareness that has diluted over time. 'In Spiros' and 'Ex Spiros' refer to the taking in of the spirit and the breathing out of the spirit, a replenishment of what the modern practitioners refer to as the 'energy body', the taiji (ring-pole), or the torus, the fundamental centre-principle, the holofractal dan tien.\n\n@Alex Fradera picked up a bit of poi with Ronan this year while out learning tai chi in India earlier this year after we spoke about the possibility the the last Lote. It was a learning situation for all of us, and not solely\u00a0happy-out either. I personally found the experience emotionally and psychologically challenging, as did many among the practitioners, and this was something that brought people together at levels we usually avoid...in our weaknesses, in our inability, and working through our own pain and complexities.\n\nThe way I see it is the way I experienced it, I started with the mind...my aim was to get over the fact I was emotionally wrecked by learning my way out...off to college to learn philosophy, I knew I could think and so I stuck with that strength...from there I felt like I was being squeezed into my brain and so, after a little experience in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOZrBeU3M50\">object manipulation</a>, I decided to use that as a practice to bring myself down from the mind-clouds...via the object. Focussing on the object took my intention and attention slowly from the internal object...personal identity and individual will, to the external object and the space in which it exists...from there, after a few more years, I eventually understood (experientially as a physically intuited fact) that 'I' was not my body, that my body was as much an object as the objects I had learned to master and thus began the practices of dance, and then yoga, through which the breath came into focus as the essence of the outer machinations...the 'spiros'. And from this, then, I came to tai chi, which is really opening up vistas of understanding for me at this (very early) stage.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is one thread of life's development. And its something to bare in mind that this is not something that absorbs all of life. Its a small part, like 'driving to work', something that doesn't require a lot of attention once you have learned what pedal does what and how to correctly shift gears and so on. At that point you are just driving to work, if people ask you what you 'do',\u00a0you do not say \"oh well, I drive to work , and I...\" no, thats would be ridiculous, and its like that with practice.\u00a0\n\nThe reason I am elaborating is only to show my own slow and protracted process as\u00a0a kind of example,\u00a0an idea of what one\u00a0might see and experience while 'learning to drive'.\u00a0\n\nStill, a good teacher will help better than the kind of trial and error I've gone through, and I am glad I found <a href=\"http://supremeboundlessway.com/\">one</a> after all. persistence with the Practice is the key.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-09-10 11:37:26", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:20.494985", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 842, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3962, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 3929, "post_number": 1, "raw": "We need one round of feedback from an experienced Drupal developer on the software design for Open Ethnographer, the software for collaborative ethnographic coding that is under development <a href=\"/t/open-ethnographer/578\">here</a>.

The core functionality to develop for this version is collaborative ethnographic coding; in tech terms, this is logically comparable to adding semantic tagging like RDFa to user-contributed content of a Drupal 7 site. However, adding a quotation manager (\"search by tag\") and (later) advanced search and analysis features should be possible in a performant way.\n\n<strong>Compensation:</strong> 150 EUR (proposed), to be invoiced from Edgeryders LbG\n\n<strong>Due date:</strong> 2014-11-22 (proposed \u2026 and sorry for the tight time plan)\n\n", "created_at": "2014-11-19 21:54:00", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:22.358277", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 559, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4512, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 4479, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/d/d0658974270d433f606ac34bd67a47914e68cda7.JPG\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\nIt was a great feeling to leave Kathmandu behind for three days last week. Dusty roads, traffic, noise - all gone once you cross the river two hours drive from the city, and enter the sensual world of remote villages.\n\nPeople really do live everywhere in this country. You see lights and shiny zinc roofs spread all across the hills, sometimes long walk from each other. I get hopelessly nostalgic and romantic when I see these places - because of their extreme purity and beauty. And because of luxurious amounts of time people devote to meeting, discussing, playing around, walking to the river, telling each other stories. Or maybe because of the lack of light in the night, which allows you to see the stars you never even dreamt of, and walk without a flashlight and \"see\" how the locals just do it, without falling and stumbling all the time? And because of the early, early mornings, when I was woken up by a swarm of people who decided to have a meeting at the school at 6 in the morning. Once you open the door to your tent, there is an old Nepali sitting on the stone that keeps the tent from flying away. Right at the very door. I guess he couldn't believe people'd be still asleep at this time of the day.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6e4374c6fffa59ba0edf6f62ec622c1a568747d8.JPG\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\nMatjaz and Eva, our friends from Slovenia who organised for weeks jeeps that provided people with most needed supplies, decided that in Rasuwa they would open a camp. This way people would stay constantly in the village and provide with more systematic help, given the size of the village and amount of needs. The idea was successful due to series of coincidences - in the Yellow House and via personal contacts they met a team of professional doctor-nurse from USA and their friend, firefighter and policeman from Slovenia. Well prepared and trained people could start an improvised hospital in the village, where they treated dozens of cases a day. There were unbelievable stories - such as finding a pwoman in a barn who was crushed by a wooden beam and spent two weeks waiting for help, as she lost her baby and broke her pelvis as a result of the incident. She was denied help from Doctors without Borders, who would not travel without a helicopter to take her out of there. The team took her on a jeep that drove each day with supplies and back to Kathmandu - and she's been through a surgery, now getting better.\n\nI am waiting for Matjaz to finish his thesis and come and write for us here, to read how was it for him to organise help on spot as a foreigner but a person with a fairly good understanding of Nepali culture and the context.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1f2dc72a2b70b052a4f48b3cb317cec9874bc2f8.JPG\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\nThe village was provided with food, tin sheets, medical help and medicine, buckets full of nutrients, vitamins and medicine that would serve new mothers and women in pregnancy, clothes and temporary housing solutions. There were dozens of tarps that were distributed across the village, and later on from the money we collected people were provided with 10 metal shelters. As for now, the shelters will serve families and orphans in the worst situation, and after the reconstruction of the village they can become more of a communal space in case of emergency.\n\nWhat's important is that a group of trained engineers who came to help building the first shelters did everything in cooperation with the locals - this way they learnt and soon took over the construction, improving the shelters with local materials. \n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6cebb8371377051691d84089deb69678c3d6f037.JPG\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\nThis way once we came to Rasuwa, we didn't have much to do in terms of actual help. We had to improvise - we prepared drawing workshops for kids from the village and once they overcame the fear of taking anything from us, it went great. We even had an exhibition on the walls of the school of their works. I brought some movies with me and organised a small screening each evening, before they had to go home. They loved it. And then we more or less spent time wandering around the village and talking to kids. This for me ended up especially fortunately, as I decided to follow two twelve-year-old boys down the hill to the waterfall. It was a tricky walk, 2000-something meters down, then across a dangerous mountain river, and climbing up again to the waterfall. But the fun we had on the way, catching animals, eating fruits we found, throwing stones in the water and being goofy under the waterfall was priceless. At least for these three days of our presence some of the kids on obligatory holidays had some new excitement - a bunch of strangers who spoke English to them and wanted to learn some Nepali in exchange, and who would follow them to see the little miracles of the place where they live.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/0/08e0e0fe7b7d3e992b2e480463633e034f9e4e9f.JPG\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\nI could go on talking about the beauty of the village, the simplicity of the food, the places we have seen, but this post is already too long. And there is one more important thing.\n\nThe relief work in Nepal is basically over and now the effort will be channeled towards reconstruction. Doing my low-scale fundraising I managed to collect 650 dollars - which was enough to buy four shelters for the village (400 dollars), support Robotics Association of Nepal to finish building another batch of solar panels (200 dollars) and 50 dollars is left for the books that will go to the <a href=\"/t/how-to-organise-help-in-nepal-questions-after-visit-in-the-bottle-house/4414\">Bottle House</a>.

About those who have also been around for years, and the behavior towards the network stays the same: we shouldn't do away with distance I think, but there may be other reasons for what makes people contribute more or less, or defect, without anyone bearing any responsibility.

It's quite large as cohousing goes, and while several values are common, there is also much diversity. Some minority groups find a home here: in our case, including vegans. We try to be inter-generational, though there are more older people than younger. That's partly due to economic factors.\n\nIt is a surprisingly complex little society, and any group like this has its own life, its own character, which would take a long time to describe. For Opencare, I'd like to focus just on one of the challenges that I see here: how we engage with our own and each other's well-being. We have at present no special provision for caring for each other: it happens in some ways at some times, informally.\n\nSharing some non-mainstream values, and a vision that is not yet shared by the majority of people, there seems to be some kind of assumption that we will provide a safe space for \"people like us\", a haven from the strain of being minorities who are disregarded, or even criticised, elsewhere. This need for a sense of psychological safety does appear in various ways, sometimes surprisingly. This is often hidden in the rest of society. Otherwise, our needs are probably similar to most people's.\n\nWe do have methods for dealing with conflict, but the challenge seems to be to get people to engage with them. Recently, a small group of members underwent training in Restorative Circles [https://www.restorativecircles.org/]. If we all understood and participated in this, it might help deal with issues that have surfaced. Relatedly, several members have developed, to differing degrees, along the path of Nonviolent Communication [https://www.cnvc.org/]. If we all interacted with each other following NVC principles, maybe that would be a highly positive influence on our community culture, and the well-being of all of us. But how does one persuade a diverse group of people with different backgrounds and histories to engage in one practice like NVC? What about other practices, like co-counselling?\n\nThis brings me to outlining the challenges that I, personally, see for our cohousing group. How do we collectively approach the issue of mental and spiritual well-being, with little common ground to start with? How can we then grow (in) a culture that effectively supports the well-being of individuals, and of the group as a whole? How can we be sure that an individual will receive the care that they need? Can we rely on informal relationships, or should we organise this in some way? Part of our well-being is the sharing of common purpose: how can we frame and agree our common purposes, from members whose values diverge? Are we fixed with the vision of the founders, or can we (and do we want to) move on?\n\nThese are hard questions to answer, but I have the sense that we will need to answer them more and more, if we are to develop the resilience that we will need as mainstream politics and economics unravel. We need now to care for each other's resources of time, energy and good will, and as we age, we will increasingly need to look after our health and strength if we are to achieve what we want to achieve, being a positive transformative influence in the world.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-06 08:26:44", "updated_at": "2017-10-06 09:09:40.815515", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 617, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 48.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31574, "user_id": 1457, "topic_id": 1860, "post_number": 17, "raw": "<b>:- )</b>\n\nI'm in to!\n\nI'll bring something also to join the colored wool tapestry!\n\n", "created_at": "2013-10-02 15:54:08", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:53.612592", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 21, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19210, "user_id": 2551, "topic_id": 4829, "post_number": 8, "raw": "Uh... that is an interesting map.

These links in the Real will lead to an explosion of ideas and will create further collaboration.\n\nI attended a conference on open government in October 2010 (Beyond Edmonton, Alberta, Canada), where an unusually high number of several \"virtual friends\" were gathered in the same room (people of the open government sphere and users of the Empire Avenue site).\n\nBeing physically surrounded by all these friends, with whom I shared many dreams, ideas and affinities, was the catalyst which helped me construct a very strong identity as an open government activist.\n\nTherefore, I expect that a similar phenomenon will happen, with the June Edgeryders conference in Strasbourg, however, with a much greater impact and long term influence.\n\nIt will be the spark that will allow to trigger change.\n\nWe have seen a bit of it happening already, with Alessia Zabatino gathering a couple of participants around the discussion of \u2018What is the value of cultural production\u2019 (where several are already contributing in a fairly informal and indecisive at the moment: Nadia El Imam, Ela, Alessia, Tiago Dias Miranda, Michel Filippi and myself).\n\nI am also having an ongoing design process with philosopher Michel Filippi, which is extending outside the Edgeryders platform, and pushed me to get engaged this February with the Institute for Consciousness Research, by engaging getting people from Los Angeles, United Kingdom and Canada to work together and inviting them to start desiging a new platform.\n\nWhile these ideas take shape, we hear about projects like the one briefly presented in this mission report by Andres Davila, and the new bold FuturICT project, with its substantial investment of a billion Euros. This morning, Michel Filippi sent me a link, about Gandhi's grandson seeing causes for hope.\u00a0 \"<em>The temptations of despair are very frequent</em>,\" said Gandhi, a former member of India's Parliament who is now a professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. \"<em>But I do see the daily evidence of the triumph of goodness....</em> \"\u00a0 (ref <a href=\"http://hnn.us/articles/gandhis-grandson-sees-causes-hope\">http://hnn.us/articles/gandhis-grandson-sees-causes-hope</a>)\n\nWhile the FuturICT project is for \u201cnotable individuals\u201d, I am convinced that other initiatives will soon take shape here and there, for \u201cordinary/extraordinary individuals\u201d such as we are... Actually, I was hoping that Andres DaVila would pick that up and say something about the \u201cnotable people\u201d\u2026\u00a0 (Anyway, I am on the same side as Gandhi\u2019s grandson. I have faith in the \u201cafter-life\u201d of Edgeryders!)\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-25 15:16:44", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:09.343646", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 552, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [14821], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13682, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4336, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Most urgent</b>\n\nI suggest you get in touch with @Noemi .

You force me to go back to <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/101/46/16385.full\">the original paper</a> by Hong and Page, and I understand it better as a result.\u00a0It is predicated on the following assumptions:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>The population is large (predictable behaviour of statistical process).</li>\n\n<li>The problem is modelled as a large number of possible approaches (2000 in the computational experiment). Each approach is mapped to a value between 0 and 100. The value V_i of approach i is drawn from the uniform probability distribution of numbers between 0 and 100. So, the value of approach 187 might be 43, the value of approach 1412 might be 86 and so on (notice this assumption, I'll come back to it). Groups of solvers are trying to find the maximum possible value V that they can find. Approaches are imagined as points in a circle.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>People differ among them because they have different heuristics (they \"look in different directions\"). \u00a0A heuristics looks like this: start at the status quo (which is a point on the circle); move clockwise a certain number of steps to another point on the circle and look for the value of the approach at that point; repeat this a certain number of times. Formally, a heuristic is made of three integers. For example, (1, 5, 3) means:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Start at the status quo</li>\n\n<li>Move 1 step clockwise and evaluate the approach you find at that point</li>\n\n<li>Move 5 steps clockwise and evaluate\u00a0the approach you find at the new point</li>\n\n<li>Repeat step 3 until you have collected 3 values.</li>\n\n</ol></li>\n\n<li>Performance of individuals is measured by the maximum value of the approaches they find.</li>\n\n<li>The way groups work together is the following: each individual goes through the process of step 3. They all compare the values of their solutions, and keep the maximum one. so, critically, <em>there is no cost assumed in sharing information</em>.</li>\n\n<li>Diversity is measured by comparing heuristics. It varies between 0 and 1. Diversity 1 means there is no overlap between the approaches tried by one participants and those tried by the other participants. Diversity 0 means all participants take the same approaches.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nLike all models, this is an approximation. I trust the proof (and honestly, it makes sense to me, though I have not tried to reproduce it). Mathematically, the result is driven by three assumptions that might not be true for all real-world problems, or at least merit further discussion:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>All approaches work</strong> to a certain extent. Any approach is assumed to have a \"value\" between 0 and 100. \u00a0Some problems do behave this way: for example, fixing Edgeryders means going to the\u00a0Task Manager\u00a0and executing any one of 200+ tasks. An approach might complete only 1, another one might complete 50 etc. On the other hand, some problems have binary outcomes: either you get your car to start or you don't.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li><strong>The probability distribution you are drawing the value from is uniform</strong>. This looks harmless, but it makes trying approaches at random very attractive. The expected value of an approach randomly drawn from a uniform distribution on the 0-100 interval is 50. On the opposite end of the scale, if only one approach leads to the correct solution (value 100) and all the others have value 0; and if there is a large number of approaches, the expected value of a random approach tends to zero. This is why there is no experimentation in life-and-death situations!\u00a0</li>\n\n<li><strong>No cost is assumed for information sharing.</strong>\u00a0This makes large groups attractive (although this is somehow counterbalanced in the computational experiment part of the paper by the opposite effect of fixed and finite set of heuristics).</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nIt is up to each of us to figure out how much we believe all of that for the problems we are facing. :-)\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-10-30 10:54:00", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:49.576856", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 712, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [23445], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22024, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4918, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Flickr?</b>\n\nTell them to use the Flickr search function for Creative Commons material.

Any conversation with him throws up more concepts than you could work through in a lifetime and I'm lucky to have participated in his <a href=\"http://www.twitpanto.co.uk/\">pantomimes performed on Twitter</a> and sat alongside him as he's carried out real time sentiment analysis for <a href=\"http://civicolive.com/\">Civico</a>, a company that is largely based around another of his ideas. He's bloody hilarious too ;-)\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nI talked to him about the issues of making a living from his own work in this skype conversation.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/QkQK8AflqJg?rel=0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<a href=\"http://www.jonbounds.co.uk/\">Jon</a> has been working, doing anything that anyone will pay him for on the internet for about 5 or 6 years. He did a computer science degree but decided that he didn't like computers in the time just pre-internet - internet was on campus only as research tool he was not taught anything about it. He became unemployed, played in bands and then did a government funded journalism course and tried writing for a living, discovered that he could do it but didn't have the discipline to fill x number of pages a day. After that he did freelance work and worked in bars before being lucky to fall into a job with a local technical publisher right at the start of the internet boom doing a lot of internet books. He explains that he had a lot of freedom and time to explore internet technologies, research as opposed to just messing around on the internet, at the time when internet was reaching normal people.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>Birmingham: It's Not Shit</strong>\n\nThe \"famous\" thing Jon did which propelled him into working and doing internet stuff for a living, as opposed to as a sideline, was a website about Birmingham with \"an amusing and probably rude or offensive name which got a bit of attention. It's called <a href=\"http://www.birminghamitsnotshit.co.uk/\">Birmingham: It's Not Shit</a> and is still going, coming up to 10 years as local website and blog\". The main reason behind it was not, as he often explains, that Birmingham was getting a raw deal from the national media, but that the national media could not be very grown up when talking about things - when September 11th happened, the media on the internet died, the BBC website went down, online newspapers went down so the only place online he could have a discussion was on Popbitch.com, a celebrity gossip site, and there people could have a sensible discussion with facts and be darkly humorous and not fall into shock! horror! or default positions. That made him wonder if media could be adult, independent and without a default position. When he was made redundant he had the time to set up B:iNS and although he had done many jobs on the internet, he had nothing to show anybody, so if he wanted to get a job doing internet stuff, it was a good excuse to do something. Because of the name and stance, it got well covered which wouldn't have happened without the shock and outrage of the local mainstream media. However he didn't get any direct work from that straight away.\n\nJon fell into a technical job at a new BBC broadcast centre which opened in Birmingham, something he feels which wouldn't of happened without the blogging. It meant he could avoid the normal route into that type of job. He \"learnt loads there, mainly about how the media works and made a lot of good contacts but 4 or 5 years later the government cuts brought it to an end\". He could have tried to to get other jobs but is not really qualified to do anything, although he has done lots of stuff but has no qualifications which lead directly into a job and his computer science degree is obsolete. He hoped people would pay him for doing internet things and was lucky to get a couple of Arts Council contracts to work on the network side of things straight away, again due to the experience built up doing his own things. \"\u2026 6 years ago people knew social networks existed but nothing about them, so anyone with experience of them and who could talk coherently in a meeting could find work\", he says.\n\nHe did that for 2 or 3 years, without having to look for work, when only a few people were doing it. Sometimes there was too much and he turned down some lucrative contracts which in retrospect he feels he should have taken. He was enjoying exploring the space, it was a new space, and he knew enough technically and journalistically to \"do some weird things, spending maybe 2 or 3 days a week working and the rest of the time taking what people were putting online and cutting and analysing that in different ways to see things which couldn't have been analysed before\".\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>Being independent</strong>\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/gpfzHDwzy0E?rel=0\n\nJon was calling it \"<a href=\"http://www.jonbounds.co.uk/blog/612/conversational-psychogeography-%E2%80%94-mapping-real-life-with-the-social-web/\">Conversational Psychogeography</a>\" but that's now been formalised into what is called Sentiment Analysis and large media organisations will now sell it to you - and he considers it an example of how this kind of thing works:\u00a0 \"If you want to be independent and find work and still have a bit of free time, you've got to stay right on the edge of what is happening with technology - the bits that are not yet viable for the big organisations to explore, because everything I've done over the past 6 or 7 years has been caught up, commodified. You get forced from two ends of the spectrum - the large media organisations, the web design and development companies and the PR companies push downwards into this space because they think they understand this; there's also a groundswell of people who really don't know what they're doing at all, but they've heard about it and they set up small companies in local areas\u2026.and I can't compete with that, I don't have the morals to allow me to knock those (websites etc) out so quickly, I can't compete with the pitching and process driven things that a large agency can, so anybody independent gets squeezed out of that and has to move on to another kind of centre and some people are doing that through their own ways\u2026 forming companies that can compete or drifting to education\u2026.or finding niches - the weird generalists are getting squeezed out.\"\n\nThings have been very difficult the last year or more and it's been hard for him to find enough work to survive on. He claims that he's not very good at networking in a money sense and feels that many things that he and his contemporaries came up with have not just been co-opted, but stolen by companies and organisations with no recompense. \"We have a culture of getting ideas out there\u2026all those things we worked on dissipated and diluted by, capitalism, essentially.\" That becomes disheartening so made a decision that he no longer cares, that the battle for this social technology revolution has been lost. Since then he has split professional and personal interests a lot more and will do uninteresting things for money, but the interesting stuff he does now has almost no commercial potential, moving back into the esoteric arty world of literature or publishing.\n\nConsequently he doesn't expect to make money from writing/publishing. He and a partner are writing <a href=\"http://www.jonbounds.co.uk/blog/1697/pier-review-review/\">a book on the English seaside</a> and needed to travel around the coast of England and Wales, but couldn't afford to, so crowdfunded it and raised just enough to cover costs. That would've been impossible without their knowledge of networks and the media coverage they got comes from knowledge of how media works. He is worried that lots of people think that funding in the age of austerity is going to come from individuals, because that is finite both in money and trust. Projects that get funded are usually from people with demonstrable experience and networks. The ability for people to live from their artistic or research practice is being really squeezed and although he and his contemporaries had the the possibility to do that for 5 or 6 years but he doesn't think people in the future will have that.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>How do thinkers get space to think?</strong>\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/FqzSewS_rjY?rel=0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"How do (the brightest) thinkers get space to think without the commercial pressures?\", Jon asks. Historically it has only has been for academics but that's only one type of thinking and there is huge pressure in academia to produce tangible monetary results. If you look for advice from any government agency, the advice is always how to bend your will to where the money is coming from, how to expand, create growth.\u00a0\n\nHe created a social enterprise 4 years ago to use social media professionals and train them to train young people rather that teaching teachers a syllabus because, \"this moves so fast that you can't teach it unless you are doing it\". The interest was always there, but never the money. The enterprise has been shuttered and there are now other people selling that model now but they are not social media people, but have spotted a gap in the training market.\n\nHe considers that a big network is needed to enable support to have creative space. Some people in the UK &amp; US have chosen to live on as little as possible to have that space, as artists always have. The problem he sees then is the disconnect between them and those their ideas might affect - if it's all outsider, how does it influence the inside, the \"normal\" people? The danger is again: ideas splitting off from commerce, splitting off from reality, there are huge problems with that.\u00a0\n\nA good example of a network supporting creative work is that of Birmingham industrialists called the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Society\">Lunar Society</a> who gave a monthly stipend to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Priestley#Birmingham_.281780.E2.80.9391.29\">Joseph Priestley</a>. He isolated oxygen among other things. Jon wonders if there is an internet or crowdfunding model for \"mini-Priestleys\".\u00a0 He would love the idea of a trickle down capitalism rewarding people that have ideas but that doesn't exist, so he asks is there a kind of trickle up internet socialism? Perhaps, for a few people but how many people could that sustain?\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>It's the Network</strong>\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/gj6twhJBffc?rel=0\n\nJon claims that for any freelancer it's who you know and it's a clich\u00e9 because it's completely true and in his opinion if you are artistically or morally driven, your network needs to larger still as the possibilities are reduced. The network is also important to him as it's part of what he's interested in. He feels that It's necessary not just to have a network but to understand how networks function, especially if you need funding or social capital. Things can travel incredibly quickly through weak tie networks but it's the strong tie networks which actually help you. \"The network is essentially all we've got\", he says.\n\nI asked Jon about the recent internet legislation battles. He considers that every piece of legislation which controls the free network is worrying - it is the free exchange of ideas that help it, and the idea that you don't need to ask to do something with those ideas. While these pieces of legislation are often well intentioned, there's a knock on effect that people often don't realise in his opinion. He doesn't disagree with copyright per se, but thinks anything that is heavy handed and can shut down a network will be abused by large corporations and large organisations. He is particularly interested in fair parody legislation especially with reference to politics.\n\nHe has got networks from prior work but the more artistic networks have come first through the internet, but then offline meeting with those people\u00a0 A lot of the network is from around Birmingham which he says seems incongruous with the idea of the global village and interconnected networks - but it is from building trust offline. There was a time just pre-recession where there were a lot of spaces where you could organise things for free - it's not the cost as much as the risk, if you're organising something with people you don't really know who is going to take the risk of hiring a venue or finding sponsors, selling tickets and collecting money? Easily accessible third spaces were incredibly important and Jon genuinely believes that meeting physically strengthens ties.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-10 08:18:22", "updated_at": "2017-08-29 05:09:01.120212", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2442, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31127, "user_id": 2551, "topic_id": 4519, "post_number": 28, "raw": "<b>Radio issue solved :)</b>\n\n@Matt check this out: https://www.crowdsupply.com/lime-micro/limesdr\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IrO4mg2ToA\n\nThis thing is a dream for people like us. :)\n\n", "created_at": "2016-06-22 20:02:24", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:51.292009", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 38, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [31126], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23571, "user_id": 1935, "topic_id": 4162, "post_number": 16, "raw": "<b>interested and following</b>\n\na comment to show interest and follow\n\nbeen learning a lot since I joined this community :)\n\n", "created_at": "2015-03-08 15:41:31", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:10.835657", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 25, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5068, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5035, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/4/4899eacf9afad0dd9aeda4e9197db3a01b605cb8.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"><br>\n\n<strong>So you are not exactly a nine-to-five, safely employed, 2.3 children type</strong>. Maybe you are trying to do your bit for this lovely blue planet and its slightly dysfunctional dominant species; maybe you are following your own need to express yourself through art, or some other creative channel; maybe you are trying to build businesses that will do good, rather than just make money; maybe you are just exploring your own life hacks. Either way, you live on the edge of society \u2013 like most of us on Edgeryders. Will welfare be around for you when you need it? Most of us are very. Damn. Sceptical.\u00a0\n\nStates and the private sector are struggling to provide everyone with high-quality, affordable health and social care. For now, the most likely outcome is a dual society, with insiders having access to 20th century-style welfare and an ever-growing precariat left to provide for itself. <strong>The welfare put in place by previous generations is failing. Time to learn how to make our own.</strong>\n\nLOTE5 is the perfect place to explore the issue. We do so through a workshop called\u00a0<a href=\"/opencare/let-s-co-create-our-own-welfare-how-to-design-collaborative\">Let\u2019s co-create our own welfare: how to design collaborative care services</a>. The basic question we explore: <strong>can communities build sustainable, adequate care services for their own members? How can we take care of each other in a way that is resilient to systemic crises, political fads, budget cuts and so on? </strong>Consistently with LOTE ethos, we take a \"no spectators\" approach and treat everyone who decides to attend as a designer.\u00a0<strong>The workshop is led by <a href=\"http://www.shareable.net/blog/design-for-social-innovation-an-interview-with-ezio-manzini\">Ezio Manzini</a>, one of the world's most prominent experts in design for social innovation. Participation is free, but registration is required</strong>. To register, follow <a href=\"/t/getting-your-ticket/4915\">these steps</a>.\u00a0\n\nIn the next weeks, we shall be zeroing in on some service that we can work on as an example of the \"care by communities approach\". <strong>One idea is to look at services for refugees</strong>. Here in Belgium (and, I suspect, elsewhere too) refugees are processed by government bureaucracies in an \"old industrial\" way: people are treated like a flow of some raw material, and funneled into a production line. From anecdotal evidence we are collecting, it seems such production line is bureaucracy at its worst; different steps must be done in sequence and not in parallel; \"hurry and wait\" dominates; refugees sit through interviews in which they are\u00a0<em>never</em>\u00a0asked what they can do, how can they contribute to the host society; they can be vouched for by social workers who have never seen them before, but not by the Belgian people they live in the homes of, etcetera.\n\nThis seems like a major fail. <strong>But we refuse to design a service for refugees without the participation of refugees as designers</strong>, even as an exercise. If you are interested in this problem and can bring first-hand experience, get in touch, and we'll see what we can do together.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-12-07 10:58:52", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:29.335160", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 579, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2201], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7902, "user_id": 18, "topic_id": 1043, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Process check</b>\n\nJust to be clear, we are editing the original post, not commenting here?

And as for the logistics part - within Bucharest/outskirts this would probably be very doable on foot. You would have a whole bunch of reasons to be supported by the city (old paints are expensive waste to dispose of - better upcycle it a little and use it!

The training took place in Georgia and it was held during a very busy period at my work, but I still decided to go. Imagine my surprise, knowing that I left my colleagues with a lot of work to do before our Annual Conference, when, at least the first days, the training did not meet my expectations. \u00a0Still, it was one of the best experience of my life. I knew then that the choices I made or did not make were the best ones. I was working (and still working) for GRASP, a global network of Romanian young professionals and students, coordinating the communication activities and strategy at a global level.\n\nMy bachelor was in Communications and PR. As I like to say, this departament chose me and not the other way around. I just wanted to prove to myself I can pass the entry exam. I had no idea what communications means and what my field of expertise will be after I graduate. Since the first year, I started volunteering in a student NGO, then I started working in the field, but not for a moment did I stop to assess my career path. I like to think that I loved too much what I was doing to put this into balance. All these were followed by a master\u2019s degree in European Communication studies, by jobs, internships and volunteerships in different communication departaments: within Greener, an environmental NGO in Romania, within the European Agency for Fundamental Rights, within Romanian Center for European Policies. Now when I think about all these, they seem normal and natural. I would do the exact same things because this is how I realised that I was lucky enough to discover my passion when I applied for my BA programme.\n\nAnd now coming back to the Georgia story. I knew then that communication is a way of being, but I could never be complete if i don\u2019t put my skills for the use of a cause. It is then that I understood that contributing to social change is the only way that I can feel my personal and professional life will have a purpose. Communications for NGOs, NGO organizational capacity building, community engagement, social entrepreneurship \u2013 these are the things that bring joy in my life. I definitely know that along the way, I will discover other things that will add up to these ones, but I know for sure that we cannot afford ourselves the compromise not to do what we are meant for.\n\nThere were times in my life when I was not sure that I made the right decisions. There were times when I thought I wasn\u2019t the proffesional I imagined to be. And it might sound unrealistic, but I often dreamt about a moment when I will be offered the perfect job. And dreams come true. At the beginning of last month, I received a job offer \u2013 no CV, no interview. They knew my work and they felt I am the right person for the job. I knew the organisation and I felt it is the right place for me. Now, while I am consulting for GRASP, I am doing communications for PACT, a Romanian NGO doing community development in rural areas in Romania. I am busy as a bee, but happy! And one can say I am jobless, because I have two wonderful hobbies that help me contribute to changes around me.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-18 20:28:51", "updated_at": "2017-09-13 10:08:37.954136", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 601, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 15.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1565, "user_id": 125, "topic_id": 1532, "post_number": 1, "raw": "In this short post, I will try and extract one possible interpretation of the campaign Living Together. To do this I have got to go auto-biographical, but you will excuse me.\n\nI was raised in one of those places in Italy which would culturally aspire to be like Alberto\u2019s, when he says that he is the only one from high school to live outside of 30 km from the school building (how beautifully does this expression describe Italian provinces?). Anyway, I said my place would aspire to be like this but it\u2019s not quite, because severe lack of job opportunities does not make this possible and actually many have emigrated to more prosperous lands over the decades. But those who remain, often build their own houses on the upper level of their parents\u2019, doing what I call \u2018km zero vertical emigration\u2019.\u00a0 It\u2019s the game of the nuclear families which add to each other without mixing too much, just constituting several layers of bonds always ready to help when it is difficult to find structural support (for the children, the elderly, those in need ect ect).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAfter several years studying in the UK, I also indulged into this model and settled down in a nice house near to my \u2018family-family\u2019. Then, due to unforeseen work circumstances, I left for the UK again. I looked for a shared cottage and came back to a sort of student life sharing with other three. I have no \u2018family- family\u2019 around, no car, no comfy food like my beloved grown-under-the-sun tomatoes. I see this is far less adventurous than most of Edgeryders experiences told here \u2013 several of which are amazing and truly enjoyable to read- and one can just think \u2018this is life, you have to adjust\u2019. And in many ways this is true. But this would also overlook what cultural models we are grown up with and how subvertive of these life can be.\n\nLet\u2019s go general: we are brought to think that transitions in life are once and for all. We are used to take for granted that once we\u2019ve had our student life for a while, and once we have earned our qualifications, we will just work, and keep on working. This does not consider that we can loose our job position, for instance. Of course we know this is possible, but it\u2019s not until it happens to us that we really realise what it means \u2013and I do think Edgeryders is playing its important part here in emotionally supporting this. Once we put ourselves into the market, we do not think we may need to re-qualify\u00a0 at some point. But none of the traditional markers of adulthood as indicated in the literature- completing education, finding a stable jobs, leaving the parents\u2019 house, forming a stable partnership and becoming a parent - are definitive and last forever. The only possible exception is becoming a parent, in the sense that once you\u2019ve had a child your role cannot cease to exist, yet I have seen so many models of doing this which involve the help of others, that I would say that even this dimension is becoming less clear-cut. Maybe there has to be some consequential sequence of events, but we are intended to follow a linear pathway which is always less common in reality. And nobody is really taking action for this, as nonetheless we seek to enchannel ourselves into something which gives our experiences a shared meaning.\n\nBut let me go back to my move to the UK. You know what? I do not have my \u2018family-family\u2019 here, but I am extending my \u2018other\u2019 family, to use an expression Edgeryders have shown to like. I share a house (i.e., a space) with people I am not meant to share a life with, but I have learned so much about myself through the eyes of this \u2018other family\u2019. I am not a monolitical entity for them, with my \u2018well-known\u2019 traits and character. They see me for how I behave now, they give a name to my weaknesses and strengths for how they appear now, they do not know what I was or what I did before unless I tell it to them and this is also liberating. I am what I am now. I know where I came from, in all possible ways.\n\nTruth is, people is moving very often across the UK and need to reconstitute their \u2018other family\u2019 in a way they would not need in Sardinia. But there is some enthusiasm you can get from all this that the linear transition model, in its rationality, does not contemplate. In a nutshell, reports in this campaign absolve a very social function. They demonstrate that if you find yourself in the situation to build your \u2018family\u2019 all over again, this does not mean you are \u2018going back\u2019 to a situation you were supposed to have overcome, nor that you failed or lost something. Instead, in sociology jargon that would be having to solve \u2018individually\u2019 a \u2018systemic contradiction\u2019. And you can actually gain a lot from having to enlarge your \u2018family-family\u2019 and bonds, which you won\u2019t probably gain just emigrating \u2018vertically\u2019.\n\n(\u2026was this a \"thank you\" to the community?

Through the gallery, cinema, festivals and screenings, the group makes connections with inspirational productions. There is an integrated approach to production, publication and distribution.\n\nAmber is making it's collection of about 100 films, 20,000 photos and 10,000 slides and accessible onsite and online.\n\n<small style=\"\">Another long interview-- this one was 90 minutes but I have cut it down to 11 minutes.</small>\n\n\u00a0\n\nhttps://player.vimeo.com/video/108277461\n\n\"The mainstream of Amber's work has always been about celebrating the ambiguities but its never been, its always been of the left, but never been dogmatically so, its capitalism in the raw and the edges around those things are interesting.\"\n\n\"The significance of it is that those stories tend to be erased, deliberately and accidentally, and that creates problems in terms of community sense of identity. Making those stories accessible to the communities and to the body politic so that in a sense those stories are not erased from a sense of where we have come, and where we are going.\"\n\n\"Steward, I don't know, I have not thought about the name particularly. I think it is that you recognize the importance of certain things. Amber is a collective, I don't mean there is a collective line, but people start talking about ideas. It is one of those things that when somebody suggests, this would be interesting,\u00a0 there is remarkable consensus, sometimes because you can see it. One of the difficulties within the community in that situations they don't often see what you see as important, initially.\"\n\n\"The arrogance... of that neoliberal political line is quite extraordinary, and the cumulative affect of that undermines people sense of, belief in their own lives, the importance of their own lives, importance of their own experience...\u00a0 as well as that there is something that is familiar you don't often think about, and those two things combined-- that is what feeds into this sort of participative development. You notice certain things but out of that contact an exchange happens as things begin to develop.\"\n\nDocumentary film and photographers are attracted to subjects just like any other artist in apart to do with things that are going on inside them their experience things they are trying to deal with in their own lives.\u00a0 Within the community there is a mixture of things. People are sometimes deeply frustrated in the way their lives have been marginalized, they find that troubling. You can see the affect of them looking at their lives through you.\u00a0 We interviewed some fisherman who had been involved in the fishing film in 89 in about 2005. One of them was saying you got it right, we did not think about it at the time, it was about over fishing. He said \"you were right, we could not see it really.\" There is this thing about time, in this, as well. They bring stuff, they see themselves and that is something, because it is a document, that you can then revisit. You can revisit, 5 years later, 10 years later, 20 years later.\"\n\n\"The quality are at such that what is captured in terms of the kind of the conflicts and ambiguities the nuances of gesture at a very very high level. I think that matters a lot. Cuz then that informs people's memory in a deeper way. The collection has become a unique thing. I am not aware of another multi-artist project that has been sustained this long, 45 years. Another unique aspect of the collection, is that there is kind of a network of connections\u00a0 and relationships between these different bodies of work... so you are not just showing the work as well as you can, but you are providing a context so that its meaningful.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-10-07 22:50:42", "updated_at": "2017-10-02 10:15:50.495969", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 734, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24268, "user_id": 7, "topic_id": 1570, "post_number": 13, "raw": "Interesting article and good points.\u00a0\n\nI went to a fairly old fashioned high school where I was basically studying the same curriculum as the boys had two hundreds years before. Maybe a bit more biology and science, but I chose the classical department of my high school which meant my focus was on latin, ancient-greek, and classical literature, arts and philosophy. Those subjects were taught by very old fashioned methods. My latin text book was one made in the 1920's, the translations of the Illiad I was to read was from the 19th century and my ancient-greek teacher appeared to old enough to remember Homer himself. That was not the only thing on my curriculum, but also danish, french, english, Icelandic, math, biology, linguistics, geology and chemistry.\u00a0\n\nIt was an interesting combination of subject, but not only that, also how they were taught. In latin and greek we were to learn by heart translations and grammar. It was not about understanding, we never read a book in those languages without translating every single word and we never had a test questioning our understanding on the subject addressed in said text. It was precise, you knew exactly what you had to study in order to pass. You could just learn it all by heart. In that way it was easy, but learning Cicero's speeches or Ceasar's accounts in De Bello Gallico is not very fun. It was very demanding and required that you'd sit down in a library for ten hours straight and just learn.\n\nIn the modern languages the focus was on understanding and critical thinking. The textbooks were colourful and pictures that would distract us from the subject. It was not as scientific as the old languages, but still, somehow we managed to learn how to say basic sentences in french. Somehow. It was merely a guess and good luck rather than based on scientific knowledge on how french grammar works. In modern languages they were afraid to teach us rules or tell us how things works in the languages with a scientific approach. The classes were fun, we approached the material in different ways and as a result, I can somehow manage to ask what time it is if I ever get lost in Paris. I don't know if that'll help though.\n\nI got to know the old traditional approach to studying and the modern way of gaining knowledge and passing tests. The difference is that I learned how to sit down and actually learn with reading Latin texts and translating greek philosophy. It was clear what the teacher wanted and you'd either get it right or wrong. The modern way of teaching was more focused on critical thinking rather than being able to recite the material by heart without thinking. To be able to gain knowledge with just listening and not even reading the book. To be a consumer of the information, but not really learn it. I think the modern way of teaching is right in some aspects. The old way too. That's why I find it important to try both. It's a different approach and while sometimes it may be necessary to be critical and express yourself, then at the same time it's really impotant to be able to sit down and study in an old fashioned way, which is something that modern day teaching doesn't really focus on, in my experience.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-07 17:36:24", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:14.578768", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 593, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23802, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 5827, "post_number": 6, "raw": "**Tweets: text broken down + favs**\n\nWelcome to \\#OPENandChange Care: An invitation to a shared 100 mill$ bid to fix health and social care.\n\n\\#OPENandChange: is it here? is it now? how does it affect me?

It refers to innovations in those fields - education, healthcare, mobility, poverty, social exclusion, environmental sustainability, and other public goods - which are usually the responsibility of governments (the Public Sector) or the Third Sector (such as charity organisations), but which increasingly are being tackled by young (and less young) individuals with unprecedented creativity, skill and entrepreneurship.

Scarsity of resources (time, as always) and limited skills (I never developed anything myself, yet!) bring me to go on thinking and elaborating this in my head, through links and in writing but keep me from actually stepping forward and implementing it. But let's go back to step one.\n\nTo your question, I have only other questions as answers: \"Can you develop it yourself, what do you need from us?\". Knowing that my experience is limited to the ER and the MT2019 platforms, it is highly probable that I speak out of ignorance:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>would this matchmaking platform be linked (as in hosted) in any way to the ER platform (part on Making the LOTE3), to the MT2019 one or maybe to the unMon?</li>\n\n<li>if developing means getting into Drupal, I start from scratch which means I should spend time on it I unfortunately really do not have. How many people and how much time would it take?</li>\n\n<li>I suppose this will take some time to become operational, but once the platform is launched, I believe that 2 months are ok to do the matchmaking until the LOTE3 (September, October): am I dreaming?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nWhat I can offer is time to share ongoing thoughts on the matter: I don't know if I've been convincing myself, but I do believe that this can be the organizational backbone to the ECOC bid as it copes with limited resources, adds value to crowdsourcing and matches people with very peculiar skills to others which have a great knowledge of the territory (other type of skill, but still a skill :). I also believe that some language issues can be solved with graphic symbols, once the basic needs are mapped (hosting, food, transporation, visits, material).\n\nFor the exchange of \"civic points\", I was imagining this more for the ECOC bid (free tickets, discounts on hotels ecc) and of course a gaming format that could be applied to other places to (this is the final aim, replicability!). I am also in the process of presenting this idea to 2 competitions although I am still hesitating on this: I felt like doing this not only to test the validity through confrontation of what has been a very solitary mental process, but also (in case the test works), to finally afford developing it.\n\nI guess my answer was a bit out of scope :) Sorry for this, it's just that I can finally let it out.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-07-04 14:20:41", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:09.009537", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 467, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [10319], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1810, "user_id": 81, "topic_id": 1777, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<strong>Un invito a vivere al limite</strong> | <em>An invitation to <strong>L</strong>ive <strong>O</strong>n <strong>T</strong>he <strong>E</strong>dge</em>\u00a0\u00a0<strong> [ L O T E ]</strong>\n\nCarissimi\u00a0 cittadini di Matera,\n\nsiamo <a href=\"https://edgeryders.eu\">Edgeryders</a>, un gruppo informale di qualche centinaio di persone che vengono da tutta Europa. Ci accomuna l'idea che possiamo contribuire a risolvere problemi molto grandi (come il riscaldamento globale o la crescente precarizzazione) anche se non siamo leaders politici, capitani di industria o accademici famosi, ma semplici cittadini come voi. \u00c8 molto ambizioso, ma noi lavoriamo duro e abbiamo voglia di imparare.\n\nDal 29 ottobre al 3 novembre saremo vostri ospiti. Il nostro lavoro comune si svolge quasi sempre su Internet, ma un paio di volta all'anno ci incontriamo fisicamente in eventi che chiamiamo Living On The Edge (parte conferenza, parte festa, parte lavoro concreto). Dopo Strasburgo e Bruxelles nel 2012, <a href=\"/t/making-lote3/360\">il terzo Living On the Edge</a> si terr\u00e0 nella vostra citt\u00e0.\n\nArrivare a Matera da posti come Bergen, Lisbona o Cluj-Napoca non \u00e8 semplicissimo, n\u00e9 particolarmente economico (e noi non abbiamo grandi sponsors, e la maggior parte di noi non \u00e8 benestante). Per\u00f2 veniamo volentieri, perch\u00e9 un progetto nato da Edgeryders, <a href=\"http://www.chefuturo.it/2013/04/la-strada-per-unmonastery-le-pratiche-radicali-per-fare-smart-communities/\">unMonastery</a>, ha messo radici a Matera. Negli ultimi mesi alcuni di noi hanno avuto l'occasione di venire nella vostra citt\u00e0 in connessione con questo, e tutti sono rimasti entusiasti della bellezza dei luoghi e dalla vostra gentilezza e ospitalit\u00e0. Abbiamo deciso che vale il viaggio \u2013 e poi tutti vogliono vedere l'unMonastery!\n\nLa lezione pi\u00f9 importante che stiamo imparando dal gruppo di unMonastery (che la sta imparando da voi) \u00e8 quanto \u00e8 importante una comunit\u00e0 locale coesa e amichevole per la riuscita di un progetto. A Strasburgo e a Bruxelles non abbiamo quasi avuto rapporti con le persone del luogo: a Matera, invece, vorremmo invitarvi a condividere con noi Living On The Edge. Siamo sicuri che possiamo imparare molto gli uni dagli altri, e magari collaborare anche per il futuro. Ci saranno barriere linguistiche, culturali, tutto quello che volete, ma noi stessi siamo tutt'altro che un gruppo omogeneo (veniamo da oltre 30 paesi diversi!). Siamo sicuri che riusciremo a capirci.\n\nCi sono molte cose che possiamo fare insieme. Per fare qualche esempio, <strong>potete collaborare con noi a costruire Living On The Edge</strong>; ci sono moltissime attivit\u00e0 in cui potreste aiutarci a rendere l'evento pi\u00f9 bello. Potete proporvi per raccontare una cosa che vi sta a cuore, o fare foto, o tradurre un po' di cose per fare in modo che nessuno si senta escluso. Se avete un po' di spazio, potete ospitare uno o una di noi per la durata della conferenza \u2013 per alcuni di noi un posto dove stare pu\u00f2 fare la differenza tra venire e non venire. Oppure <strong>potete semplicemente venirci a trovare</strong> al Palazzo del Casale, nel cuore del Sasso Barisano, per conoscerci e stare un po' insieme. Pensiamo anche di organizzare una festa di Halloween, e ovviamente siete invitati.\n\nSe vi interessa fare queste cose, o semplicemente volete capire meglio, scrivete a Ilaria o Noemi, in italiano o in inglese, come preferite.

And to learn to trust in the world and behave in a way that promotes trust in the world by others.</span>\n\n<span>I\u2019ve been poor. Very very poor. The kind of poor where you\u2019ve just spent your last krown (Im swedish) on a kilogram of pasta two weeks before the end of the month and don\u2019t know how to pay the rent. Somehow I did manage to be creative during those periods but I remember an omnipresent sense of fear about the future. Not fear of not being able to feed myself, because I could always ask my parents for help in the worst case scenario, but of being too low on the social ladder to have an exciting fun life with exciting sparkly people around me in exciting sparkly fun environments. And fear of lynch mobs. </span>\n\n<span>My heart sank when the results of the national elections came in. I had always been warned that minorities, people who look different are always scapegoats as soon as the majority feels their livelihoods are at stake. But I saw first one fundamentally wealthy nation attack it\u2019s minorities (Denmark) and then another one go down the ugly road of divisiveness(Sweden) within my lifetime.  A friend\u2019s grandparents, holocaust survivors, to this day always have a packed emergency suitcase in their hallway. And in my middle school many of my classmates were kids of Polish and Russian academics who had fled their respective countries to make a new life in Sweden. I can completely understand the drive and in fact I find myself always taking into account the possible need to leave very quickly, to escape. I think even my professional choices have been coloured by this in choosing to be in a new space (Tech) where the roles are not really all that cemented yet and the underlying values are ones of sharing and meritocracy. </span>\n\n<span>At some level my brain is wired to equare money with security, and more money means more personal security- gated communities etc. And I yet never seem to be interested enough to stick to a path that leads to more of it. Actually my story is a string of failed attempts at mad and completely unrealistic projects that dont pay. First I decided I wanted to build an Online distribution platform for short films and interactive content, it was to be called the Digital Arts Mirror or DAM.  I tried to build it by writing plan after plan and pitching them to different parts of the public and private sector. What\u2019s wierd is that people actually humored me and were\u2019nt too condescending so I just kept going, running around between different film festivals, bullshitting my way into meetins etc. At some point I had managed to get together a group of 10 people, and we would have lots of meeting that never lead to anything until eventually it fizzled out. The reason being plain and simple that I didn\u2019t have the production or programming skills to just go ahead and make it happen without needing to raise capital, to pay someone to do it for me. And it was too all over the place for anyone to want to invest their time into it. I was in Engineering school at the time, doing the bare minimum to scrape by with most of the courses. Then a friend started doing her master\u2019s  (she\u2019s a bit older than me) on sexual fetisches and that lead to alot of interesting conversations about the brain. I mentioned this to a guy I was dating at the time and he handed me, the minds eye, a book by Daniel Dennet. I talked my way into the neurobiology and cognitive neuropsychology courses at the Medical university and I think it was the first time I really put any serious effort into studiying. I was completely obsessed.</span>\n\n<span>Obviously alot of stuff was going on, I was living with a very self-destructive friend who I had to to cut off after they threw snakes down my mailbox (yes, they did). And the final rush of the University program was up ahead with classmates finishing their degrees and heading off for stellar careers with me feeling very sorry for myself and very aware of the lack of any sellable practical skills after the DAM fiasco. So I did just that, felt sorry for myself and threw a full on tantrum in a computer lab at Uni. That set of a cascade of events I can\u2019t really get into here but it ended up with me landing my first grown-up paid gig post college. Not a job, but a paid gig devising and implementing my own great project in a very hierarchical organisation with lots of strange rules designed to keep wildcards like myself out. And it was a position that wasn\u2019t there for me to fill, I didn\u2019t go looking for it. I think I was lucky to some extent. Just having the right mix of non-mainstream experiences and skills, a flamboyant personality and being at the right place at the right time. But the place was what is considered an elite university. And a large chunk of the reason I could afford to be there and also fail at all kinds of experiments is because of the conditions we have in Sweden: university is free of charge for citizens and you are entitles to take a loan and grant from the state to Study if you are accepted into any university course or program. Im eternally grateful that it exists and hope it never ever goes away so others can have the same space.</span>\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/c/ca858f001300721b028deeeac21eef632c495eab.jpg\" width=\"511\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\n \n\n<span>Back to money. The experience living on an ice-breaker with 12 lovely, warm people changed something for me- being in a nurturing environment where most never had any money taught me a few things about myself and about what makes me happy. It also taught me that you need to invest either money, or alot of time into creating a good social environment for yourself. You have to be engaged and excite others about it in either case, but you need time and or money. And if you\u2019re working a dayjob, the time part goes out the window...and so does money because let\u2019s face it, unless you\u2019re an investment banker you\u2019re never really going to make enough money to do what I want to do. So my way is to try to put alot of time and engagement into creating events that people I want to be surrounded by and learn from, will get excited enough to attend and that everyone else values enough to fund.</span>\n\n<span>And finally the lynch mob. I\u2019m still terrified of it. Even more so after learning more about the way the brain and the world are wired. But I\u2019ve decided to try to do something about it. It\u2019s really a nuisance because I am no do-gooder- and I\u2019m still trying to figure out how to build a life where I have access to the people and things that make me feel good (great food, nice clothes, big home with big windows and high cieling etc). My brain is wired to equate money with security but my mind, aided along by my husbands optimism, has done the thinking and come to the conclusions that my access to all of those things I care about is determined by changes that happen on a global scale. And my mind also knows that unless I get in the game and try to affect change so that life doesn\u2019t completely suck for those of us who are in the proverbial middle class, there\u2019s a node missing in the needed network. And my heart knows that someone somewhere on the other side of the plane, maybe a cousin of someone I went to school with in one of the 10 countries I grew up in, is paying for me to live this life. And it tells me that our fates are connected that cousin and I. It tells me that in the big picture it\u2019s way better if we\u2019re both ok- if that means I have a little less of the great food that\u2019s fine.</span>", "created_at": "2011-10-15 16:18:32", "updated_at": "2017-09-11 00:10:59.130715", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1439, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5390, "user_id": 3011, "topic_id": 5357, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<div id=\"primary\">\n\n<strong>An encounter which aims to highlight the relevance of the commons-oriented approach of peer production and collaborative economy, while proposing public policies and providing technical guidelines to build platforms for collaborative communities.</strong>\n\n<strong>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</strong> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 <a class=\"moz-txt-link-abbreviated\" href=\"http://www.procomuns.net\" moz-do-not-send=\"true\"> www.procomuns.net</a>\n\n<strong>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</strong> Contact: <a class=\"moz-txt-link-abbreviated\" href=\"mailto:info@dimmons.net\" moz-do-not-send=\"true\"> </a><a class=\"moz-txt-link-abbreviated\" href=\"mailto:info@dimmons.net\">info@dimmons.net</a>\n\n<strong>WHEN &amp;

This is the case in corporate-based peer production such as Uber or Airbnb. Are they truly collaborative economies?. This issue opens up a series of debates and opportunities about how to <strong>retain the commons and socially transformative dimension in the collaborative economy through the recognition of the distinctive values of these modes of production</strong>, beyond value approaches which focus on monetization, and new forms of open/peer/platform cooperativism.\n\nHowever, public debate mainly focuses on the controversies around large corporations entering the collaborative economy. Thus, the public is mostly aware of peer production through these few large corporations. There is a <strong>growing need to organize and raise the visibility of the commons and socially-oriented model</strong>, and to address which are the conditions that should be present in order to characterise an economy or enterprise as \u201ccollaborative\u201d.\n\n<span>Additionally, recent technological developments, such as emergent blockchain technologies, have opened up new avenues of commons production, </span><strong><span style=\"font-weight:\n\nnormal\">management and distribution through more decentralized governance structures</span></strong><span>, which also open up very promising avenues for the evolution of the collaborative economy.</span>\n\n<span>The more important commons-based peer production becomes, the more that controversies emerge, attracting the interest of public administrations. Still, it remains largely unclear </span><strong><span>what the role of public administrations might be, which Public-Commons partnerships could be established, and what policy approach could be the most productive and beneficial</span></strong><span>.</span>\n\n<span>The event main goal </span><span>is to h</span><span>ighlight the </span><b>relevance of the commons-oriented model within the collaborative economy</b><span>, </span><span>and build policy and technical resources to promote its scalability.</span>\n\n<span>The encounter will </span><strong><span>mix plenaries with unconference / open space working groups</span></strong><span> to achieve the targeted outcomes. Participants will have the chance to suggest other activities. </span>\n\n<b>Antecedents </b>\n\n<span>The event will follow up on the previous workshop <a href=\"http://www.p2pvalue.eu/floss4p2p-workshop-agenda\" moz-do-not-send=\"true\"> FLOSS4P2P</a>, organized by the <a href=\"http://www.p2pvalue.eu/\" moz-do-not-send=\"true\"> P2Pvalue</a> european project, this time expanding the focus to policy. It will provide an opportunity for policy people to interact with the technical teams of Free/Libre/Open Source Software (FLOSS) platforms for commons-based peer production communities, and to get a \u201cdeep dive\u201d into how to promote the commons approach to collaborative economy from institutions.</span>\n\n<strong>TOPICS</strong>\n\n<strong>Policy</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\t\t<span style=\"font-weight:\n\nnormal\">Good experiences and policy recommendations for commons-oriented peer production and collaborative economy</span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t\t<span style=\"font-weight:\n\nnormal\">Cities and commons</span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t\t<span>Value and commons-oriented peer production and collaborative economy</span>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Areas of collaborative economy</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\t\tOpen knowledge</li>\n\n<li>\t\t\t<span style=\"font-weight:\n\nnormal\">Industrial Commons and open design</span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t\t<span style=\"font-weight:\n\nnormal\">Digital DIY</span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t\t<span style=\"font-weight:\n\nnormal\">Internet of Things</span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t\t<span style=\"font-weight:\n\nnormal\">Open Source Hardware</span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t\t<span style=\"font-weight:\n\nnormal\">Peer cooperativism</span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t\t<span style=\"font-weight:\n\nnormal\">Feminist collaborative economy</span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t\t<span>Circular Economy</span>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Tech</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\t\t<span style=\"font-weight:\n\nnormal\">Decentralized technologies and blockchain</span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t\t<span style=\"font-weight:\n\nnormal\">Free and Open Source Software (FLOSS) platforms for communities in the collaborative economy</span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t\t<span style=\"font-weight:\n\nnormal\">FLOSS proposals for boosting commons communities participation, growth and resilience (e.g. architectures, reward models)</span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t\t<span style=\"font-weight:\n\nnormal\">Methodologies to integrate stakeholders in the development of platforms for communities (design thinking, agile, lean)</span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t\t<span>FLOSS alternatives to \u201cwalled gardens\u201d (in communication or collaboration), especially if decentralized </span>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n\nDate: 2016-03-11 10:00:00 - 2016-03-13 20:30:00, Europe/Madrid Time.\n\nURL: http://procomuns.net/en/", "created_at": "2016-03-01 09:42:05", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:31.045183", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1700, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14569, "user_id": 217, "topic_id": 2582, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>that could work</b>\n\nI also figure I'll have a couple of days inbetween the Georgia workshop and the Armenian one, in which I can quickly edit together a couple of little stories (like this one from lote3 of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BDCGEBhK6Q\">Pio's geological lesson</a>) I might try my hand at vine as well while I'm there, see if I can come up with some interesting 6-second stories.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-03-26 16:32:55", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:22.223834", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 82, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1272, "user_id": 89, "topic_id": 1239, "post_number": 1, "raw": "I was born in Uruguay 38 years ago, exactly in the year <strong>1973</strong> when the military dictatorship began there. Some members of my paternal family were involved in the opposition movement (called the Tupamaros), so at that time my family diaspora began, some of them simply to save their lives (an uncle was not fortunate enough), and and others, like my father, because he suddenly lost his job and without the possibility of finding another .. so in the year 1976, my father, my mother, my little brother and me were in the middle of the jungle in Formosa, Argentina. That was a turning point, where my family ceased to belong to the middle class and began a journey of about 10 years, knowing the vulnerability associated with poverty across Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil. One of the memories that I will never forget from those times, is of myself, a lively squirrel with the shape of a skinny kid of 10 years, selling cakes in the hot and dusty streets of Asunci\u00f3n to help with the household economy.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor my parents the experience was devastating, especially for my mother, who from that time began to suffer serious health problems, but for me the situation was normal, as I basically didn't know other. Paradoxical as it may seem, those were good years for me, my world view and my personality too, were formed in an unstructured and chaotic environment made of the interactions with all sorts of people, situations and landscapes. I was also lucky enough of having parents educated and with taste for reading, so in that period, they took care of my education and handed me passion for the books .. and more importantly, they give me a lot of love and the conviction that the future can always be improved through our actions.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFrom the experiences of those years, a seed was planted inside me \u2026 but it took some time in order to begin to grow \u2026 when we returned to Uruguay, life slowly began to normalize, well, normal by the standards of my parents, for me it was a strange period, where I had a hard time adjusting to all the new rules I was suddenly exposed, but the human being is extremely flexible, so I went adapting again ... the time passed, I finished university as an engineer, and started a normal life of middle class in Uruguay. But really in my heart I was not satisfied. Safety and comfort are good, but the price paid for them is too high .. high for the people that is outside of this \u201ccomfort circle\u201d, but their resources and hands are used to build the others comfort .. and high for the people inside of the \u201ccomfort circle\u201d, where many of these people should be conformable with \u201cinsane\u201d rules (such as working in jobs with non sense), to keep this comfort. For this reason, in the year 2006, on a typical day in a good \u201cno sense\u201d job, as the IT manager for Shell Uruguay, the seed planted in me, fruit of all my past experiences, started finally to grow.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI decided that I wanted to help myself in being more human \u2026 human in a subtle sense, i.e. someone who spends its vital time growing in meaning and helping others to grow. When for example, I was selling cakes on the streets of Asunci\u00f3n, I was like the other boys who were with me at the streets, they were my peers ... now, they are not my peers anymore \u2026 cause currently I have a greater degree of choice than them .. and that's a shame, because the only real difference between them and me, is that I had the chance to receive more education than them, and some small opportunities to use this education \u2026 and this is in fact the only real reason for which I have right now a \u201cvoice\u201d here. So, in the 2006 I decided to steer my life in a different direction, a direction focused on developing and contributing to solutions that help people to get motivation, education and access to opportunities \u2026 the very same things that time ago helped me.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBecause of this decision, in 2006, following my own path, I came to Europe not knowing anyone here. There are several reasons for this decision of coming to Europe; first, here is one of the places where decisions are taken and the changes occur, so if you want to help in a real change, nothing more effective than going to one of the centers of action and getting involved there. Second, I wanted start to study again, because in my mind knowledge is essential for change, and Europe is again a hotspot in the knowledge arena. Third, I'm also European, in fact I have the Italian citizenship cause my mother, that made me easier to come here for the first and second reason, and also gave me a cultural and historical reason to be here.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd now, in the <strong>2011</strong>, I'm finally a researcher (being completed a master and finishing my PhD), and I started to use my new knowledge and contacts on developing and contributing to solutions that help people to get motivation, education and access to opportunities. For this reason I started a project like <a href=\"https://drumbeat.org/en-US/projects/every1tutor-everyone-a-tutor\">Every1Tutor</a> , and I'm involved in <strong>Edgeryders</strong> \u2026 cause I'm dreaming with a world where we all are peers \u2026 and for that we are needing peers to help to build the solutions to make that dream closer to reality ...\n\n", "created_at": "2011-10-18 22:28:29", "updated_at": "2017-09-21 13:40:17.838253", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 988, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24739, "user_id": 2916, "topic_id": 4830, "post_number": 8, "raw": "Dear Rossana,\n\nWe will ask our PLSIGN to sign first.

That feeling has been a well-known companion of mine during the last years, too. And while I know that everyone's ryde is different, and yours couldn't be more different from mine, here is what has helped me. Maybe you can draw something from it.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Keep eyes and ears open.</strong> Let others inspire you and get all the information that is out there before settling on plans. (No need to flesh this out - you did already in the mission report.)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Integrate what fascinated you.</strong> Like you, I can get interested in many different things in a row, and also lose interest again. In retrospect, what helped to find my permanent passions was keeping track of my past and aspiring interests and trying to find their common ground and integrate them with what I did currently (\"pivoting\"). That way, on a curvy path, I somehow arrived at the one and only project that fascinates me permanently, with first contributions ranging back 14 years from now. (Also helps to build up lasting impact on the world instead of allowing others to obliterate your past achievements because you're up to something completely different now.)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Keeping track of your mind.</strong> Actually, I do the above integration of past and future interests with a mindmapping software (<a href=\"http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/\">FreeMind</a> - it's free). Whenever I was completely lost in not knowing what to do in life, I sat down with FreeMind and my past mindmap plans, did a lot of drag&amp;drop and rewriting and summarizing of projects and ideas and journals, and arrived at a plan that I was happy with (for that moment of the path at least). It's like externalized thinking, helping to keep track of and arrange more aspects than my brain can. Sounds crazy? I didn't imagine this either when starting with FreeMind ... . Will not be everybody's favorite technique of course.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Having a guiding question.</strong> Throughout my search for my long-term vision, I had this guiding question: What's most appropriate for me to do in the world as it is? One could also frame it as \"what's meaningful\", but taking into account personal attributes and haves and the state of the world as it is. Sounds a bit general, but note that it prevented my from pursuing personal happiness first - I sort of knew that it would be a result of knowing \"to do the right thing in this world\". A guiding question helped keep my plans and actions coherent and synergistic, even though the plans themselves changed often.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Having a hypothesis for life.</strong> I never questioned this above-mentioned guiding question. It was, in my case, rather rooted in a Christian world view. I see such a world view as a hypothesis that you can only test by living it out - upfront rationalizing cannot ultimately answer if it's true or wrong. Whatever world view one has currently, one should stay open for the option that it can fail as a hypothesis, needing a complete fresh start ... . In any case (and independent of truth content), a consistent world view proved to be a great tool to introduce order and cohesion into the various aspects and plans in life.</li>\n\n</ul>\u00a0\n\nAll this is not about choosing a paid job opportunity, but about finding one's life vision and purpose. (If necessary, then go and create the job that fits it ...).\n\nJust my 2c!\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-18 16:49:11", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:51.315224", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 627, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27217, "user_id": 3310, "topic_id": 6059, "post_number": 13, "raw": "<b>wake me up!</b>\n\nDear @Yannick\n\nI'm very interested.

I can imagine that all of these features, combined with passion and drive for change, made his little crazy project such a success in his hometown in Lamjung in Nepal.\n\nHe was 24, studying in India, when he was on the phone that Saturday morning, which ended abruptly after his friend said something is shaking. His friend went silent, he learnt about the earthquake, and for three days tried to contact his relatives with no success. The third day someone picked up the call and his family was safe and sound, even if the situation in the village was miserable: houses in rubble, food supplies lost, no help coming through. His project started with contacting friends in India and the US and fundraising - with the main help of Natasha, who used to work as a scholar in Nepal back in the 90-ties and stayed in touch with Bibek and his family. They shortly collected 100,000 indian rupees and while visiting the villages in Gorkha, Sindupalchowk and other hard hit areas, he came up with the perfect use for these and the future fundings: young people will rebuild the villages.\u00a0\n\nBibek is a social scientist, but he has guts to drive it - he researched low cost housing, contacted his friends, used his network and begged whomever he met to help and get involved. As the money to the Fundforlamjung.org website started flowing, the initial plan to build temporary shelter was replaced by permanent constructions that can stand earthquakes up to 9 degrees. It was the first such project in Nepal after the disaster. It grew organically - now Bibek has a global family of supporters and collaborators, who regularly contribute to the cause and continue rebuilding Nepal. So far they have finished 16 houses (with the first one being completed in April 2016!) and their operations are expanding to other regions with more than just homes. One of the villages they are working on will be a holistic and spiritual village, attractive to fans of yoga, meditation, etc., a place where both locals and tourist from Nepal and abroad can recharge and heal. And he plans for more themes: athletic village, cultural one. Bibek wants to imagine far horizons for these new places, with bright, sustainable futures. I believe he has everything it takes to make it possible.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-12-09 08:26:09", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:34.832999", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 440, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26360, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 2421, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Slowly getting around to writing a blogpost about the Lab</b>\n\nI had penned notes but need to structure them better.

Facilitators: Philippe Verstichel and Kat Borlongan. Policy makers-in-residence: Prabhat Agarwal, Fabrizio Sestini, Rory Smith at European Commission DG Connect. Thanks to Prabhat Agarwal for helpful comments and edits.\n\nThe parent session from which this sprung up was the \u201cRewiring Innovation Policy\u201d. The original question was: what would innovation policy aimed at supporting innovative networked individuals, rather than organizations, look like? In the course of the session, Edgeryders itself has been used repeatedly as an example of a network of innovative (to variable degrees) individuals. One hypothesis, confirmed by the early discussion, was that public support needs an organizational shell, for accountability reasons. Our sub-session looks at <strong>what organizational form might Edgeryders take</strong> to best support the innovative individuals participating in the network. Lessons were learned along the way.\n\n<h2>What the terrain looks like</h2><h3>Context</h3><ul>\n\n<li>About 95% of public financial resources spent on innovation are spent at the national level. The EC is an important player, but by no means the only one.</li>\n\n<li>The EC is a public body subject to pretty strict accountability rules: every cent that is spent needs to be traceable. In this respect it is a defensive organization. It has several oversight mechanism breathing down its back; therefore \u201cit is in the paper trail business to avoid being shot down\u201d. In fact, most bureaucracies are defensive to some degree.</li>\n\n<li>When you think about what you want to achieve consider <em>output, outcome, impact</em>. Suppose your project is to buy a 3D printer, use it to develop some great new product, and sell it on the market. Output is that you actually bought the machine, and you have an invoice to show for it; outcome is that you did develop some product; impact is that the product was actually great, and led to your company successfully taking off. Most oversight is at the output level, which is the easiest to check for. On impact \u2013 which is really what the policy is trying to buy in the first place - typically (so-called \u201cex-post\u201d) evaluations are carried out, not accounting checks.</li>\n\n<li>Risk-taking behavior (in the style of venture capital funds, that are designed to support companies that will mostly fail but sometimes win big) needs to be explicitly called for and acknowledged publicly. Pure accounting errors are targeted to fall within a so-called <em>acceptable error rate</em>. For the EC, this rate is typically a few percent. This refers to errors on outputs. Some funding schemes explicitly accept risk in outcomes and impacts, e.g. Future and Emerging Technologies. But even compared to those, Venture Capital investors tend to accept much higher risks on outcomes and impacts, sometimes up to 95%. In other words they are happy that many of their companies fail (though with sound accounts).</li>\n\n<li>As a result of all this, giving public money for strange, inherently risky activities like innovation has a high administrative cost (the administrative cost of procuring standardized goods/services, like toilet paper, is much lower, because given specifications the agency can simply choose the contractor with the best price). This cost is more or less fixed: evaluating and managing a 50K euro proposal costs the same a evaluating a 2 million one. So, public agencies gravitate towards funding the large ones.</li>\n\n<li>These constraints are much less severe for private funding: trusts, foundations, philantropists etc. can give you money on a handshake provided their board of trustees has a hands-off approach.</li>\n\n</ul><h3>Know thy enemy</h3>Where there is public money up for grabs, there is a risk of fraud. The danger is highest for activities like innovation, in which \u2013 by definition \u2013 you don\u2019t know if what you build is going to work until you have built it. Fraud is discouraged by building a repossession mechanism into the policy: if someone can\u2019t account for money, they are sued and their assets (buildings etc.) can be repossessed.\n\nFraudster are your enemies. They poisoned the well, building a climate of distrust. To interact with funding institutions, you must look different from a fraudster. To the EC, a typical fraudster looks like this:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>recently constituted \u2013 no history</li>\n\n<li>no employees</li>\n\n<li>no capital or minimal capital</li>\n\n</ul>In other words, exactly like Edgeryders and other networks of peers. If you are a network and you want to interact with institutions, you have to signal that you are different. Given that interaction happens through bureaucratic procedures \u2013 you can\u2019t go have a beer with the EC and show them what a cool person you are \u2013 that can be difficult.\n\n<h3>Distributed authority in organizations: two examples</h3>Some networks have managed to style themselves as \u201cdistributed authority organizations\u201d. Two examples that might be worth investigating:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>the Open Knowledge Foundation. Great interface with the EC.</li>\n\n<li>the Pirate Party. That\u2019s more interface with the political space rather than the policy space.</li>\n\n</ol>Hypothesis: these are the result of a top-down decision to distribute\n\n[Ideas for this section (from PVerstic63) : I think OKF is good at tackling solutions whereas Piraty Party is good at tackling problems - problems space and solution space are two different animals - it looks to me that Edgeryders is neither in problem space nor in solution space, it is rooted in action space with a view to provide tools for the transition to a better future. So, with the buzzwords in mind, it is trying to have a social impact without pretending to have the solution - which is what in my humble opinion social innovation should be about. Hence the question of distributed authority is more a question of leadership rather than power relationships - the OKF in Italy is a typical example of authority by expertise (one individual is a great hacker in GIS). Of course it should not become a technocracy (which is another form of bureaucracy), there is a need for a kind of authority that leaves room for egalitarianism together with diversity.]\n\n<h3>The distributed legitimacy problem</h3>Reforming organization in distributed power social contexts has a legitimacy problem. Can Alberto decide that, starting tomorrow, Edgeryders becomes an organization and just register it? Can Nadia, or anyone else? Who gets to be on the board? Who gets to be the figure head, the CEO, the President, the High Priest(ess)? Where do we incorporate it? The question is not technical, but relational: it is plausible that, if anyone makes the move, people will spend the next month discussing it. In a bad scenario, the community might even be destroyed by mutual accusation of appropriation... silly, yes, infantile, yes, but we\u2019ve all seen it before. Mythical founders are typically the right people for the job \u2013 like Jimmy Wales morphing Wikipedia from for-profit to non-profit.\n\n<h2>Possible solutions</h2><h3>With zero funding</h3>No, we don\u2019t do an Edgeryders org. ER remains a network of people; its purpose is to empower individual Edgeryders to do their thing. The network does not seek funding: we help each other access funding as needed. The ER network is not costless to run. We can sustain it for a year, by committing to each other the time to keep the online network lively; we can work towards at \\#LOTE3 in 2013 with near-zero funding, as \\#LOTE2 showed.\n\nThis brings a lot of political capital: we can actually sit down and interact with funding agencies, because we (the network) don\u2019t want anything from them, so everybody can relax and speak the truth. The session with the DG connect people was extremely frank and illuminating for many of us.\n\n<h3>With some funding</h3>Yes, we are going to seek a small amount of funding. For the first year, we should probably try to raise philantropic money, because the organizational profile of a newborn NGO is too weak for gov or certainly Euro funding. Also, a newly formed NGO can manage 20K, but would disintegrate under the pressure of accounting for 1 million. This requires someone to take charge \u2013 probably with the unconditional support of the more senior and influential members of the community.\n\nAn alternative funding strategy is to bundle the network conversation with some kind of activity (like the idea of systematizing the emergent pattern of collaboration into some kind of distributed consultancy) and run a Kickstarter campaign.\n\n<h3>Actionable: projects inventory</h3>Whatever the fundraising decision, it makes sense for people to write in the platform what they are working on. This facilitates mutual recruitment: knowing someone is working on something.\n\n<h3>Actionable: European Social Innovation Prize</h3>It would make sense to write an application to ESIP. Alberto (one of the judges) will declare conflict of interest and will not vote, but there is the off chance that we\u2019d get 20K no strings attached. Consideration Structure - now Edgeryders is migrating from being a Council of Europe project to something else - there is a greater potential for misunderstandings among the participants. Clarity and some kind of defined structure (social contracts?) is necessary to avoid this.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-12-08 16:09:58", "updated_at": "2017-10-04 10:47:19.512215", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1586, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 20.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7978, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 6033, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Fantastic work! </b>\n\nReally good work, @brenoust !

It seems to be progressing, though I don't have a date yet. I am still hoping to announce in the Fall, start residencies in late spring 2013.\n\nEdgeryders have been asking about what problems for the local community the Unmonastery could help with. Here are a couple of very tentative things we have come up with:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>building the Unmonastery itself.</strong> The Matera crew is investigating possible buildings to locate the UM. We are thinking to turn over to the Unmonks an unfinished space: that is, a space that is safe, has electricity, plumbing and connectivity, but with the scope to be customized. This could be a great way to get the local community involved and build legitimacy for the UM: the city gets a new, exciting public space.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li><strong>terraforming Matera - the Matera way</strong>. Matera has been inhabited for over eight thousand years, and its climate is quite dry. So people had to learn water engineering for dry climate quite early. And they did amazing things! In 1991, new digs revealed a 5 million liter water tank built under the main square in the 16th century, and used as late as the 1940s. They had to send in scuba divers to explore it: now you can visit it (it looks live a sort of batcave, but it's all padded with some ancient waterproofing system) and still they have not completely figured out how the hell it worked. A nice project would be to revisit ancient Matera water engineering and upgrading it for the 21st century. The advantages would be higher water efficiency, more water self-sufficiency of the city, and the reconstitution of a very useful pool of ancient knowledge. A somewhat similar project could be undertaken for energy</li>\n\n<li><strong>urban hygiene</strong> <strong> </strong>and<strong>\u00a0controlling stray dogs. </strong>This is mindblowing: the two main expenditure for the city are street sweeping and stray dog control. The territory of Matera is large enough to accomodate Milan and Turin together, but the city has only 60,000 inhabitants. As a result, the city budget is heavily constrained by fulfilling legal obligations as to sweeping and controlling stray dogs. They spend 700K euro a year on stray dogs! You guys figure out a solution, you've got a buyer. Ah, and they just started a well-run incubator (which could actually be the UM's next cave neighbour) in case someone wants to do a company on this. \u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>Any thoughts?\n\n", "created_at": "2012-09-10 09:30:31", "updated_at": "2018-06-03 05:48:52.412166", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 468, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26882, "user_id": 2472, "topic_id": 4094, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Updates?</b>\n\n<span>Hello @noemi,</span>\n\nThanks for your post, it accurately captured last week's discussion!

We decided to take the dogs out for a hike in the hills behind our new apartment. It was a very windy, cold day. But the environment was amazing: long stretches of yellow fields, small bushes, some cows wandering around here and there, and mostly nothingness. The bliss of silence and emptiness. Away from urban structures.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/692b6bcab261a3bead883d6fb741993d6f902e99.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"459\"><br>\n\nAnd that's when we saw it. On a trailer. In the middle of nowhere.\n\n\u201cIt's not you.\u201d\n\nA few weeks later we walked in down town. Without the dogs. With a visiting friend. We did our usual tourist walk. And while we passed the Georgian Orthodox Patriarch's house, George noticed something on the pavement.\n\n25.000.000. The amount the church receives from the Georgian government.\n\nNot long after we noticed a billboard on a central square. DRO, it said, in bold black letters. Time. That is what it means. And every day, thousands of cars would pass it. On top of a building, in the heart of the center.\n\nIt definitely got us talking. And our friends. And our neighbors. And our relatives. And our co-workers.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">The whole city had seen texts appearing on buildings, trailers, garages, billboards. Questioning the urban space we live in, questioning the society we live in.</h3>\n\nMeet <a href=\"http://www.sadarismelia.com/\">Mariam Natroshvili and Detu Jincharadze</a>, the artists behind it all. Since 2011 <a href=\"/u/sadarismelia\">@sadarismelia</a> work together.\n\nThey work in two directions: text based art, interventions in public spaces; and ghost museums, site specific installations inspired by different stories, knowledge and mythology.\n\nI started doing this kind of work, because I wanted to start a conversation, I want to question things happening in society. To change it maybe. But I don't have any illusions, I just want to start the conversation. Artists should always ask questions, not answer it.\n\nFirst, when we started, it was much more linked to urban problems, and architecture. Abandoned buildings, soviet stye buildings: creating a new language of the city. And that is what urban art is for me, creating a new language. Language of the people that can not talk or are invisible. That is one of the reasons that we are making spaces talk. Literally.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/f/fd9108f9fe03d8434b0ca765c99ebef20acc42d0.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"459\"><br>\n\nThe first thing we made was a poem by Carlo Kacharava. He's a poet and writer from the 1990s and we put his critical poem on a wall. We wanted to make the city a book and use contemporary not very popular writers. But we only made one. It was too difficult as it was too much work.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Mariam explains me how she believes in art without bureaucracy and without permissions. Art should be outside of galleries and museums. Art should instigate change, it should question and provoke. A perfect example is the 25.000.000 project.</h3>\n\nIt was a reaction, a question. Me and young artists Gvantsa Jishkariani made this stencil in front of the patriarchs residency on his birthday. This is the amount which the church gets from the government every year. In a country where social and economical problems are severe, the government pays 25 million to an organization which speaks a language of hate and threatens people with hell. The Organization which organized a violent mob of thousands of people against 50 activists trying to raise awareness over LGBTQ rights.\n\nThe main idea of this text was to question this. And then, what should we do? Should we cancel it? When should we cancel this agreement? Or, what they did in Germany, where they opened the archives and you can find who was KGB.\n\nThose were main results which I wanted to see.\n\nWe had problems with the police and the patriarch's security after this project. The text was made on the pavement and legally the police couldn't fine us. But together with patriarch\u2019s security in the police department they tried to threaten us so that we wouldn't ask any questions again.\n\nWe got a lot of messages, a lot of people were upset. It was unimaginable to them. But the conversation has to continue, it started, but I don't think it continued.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Mariam and Detu use urban spaces to start a dialogue. Project Hyper Text Transfer Protocol is about the language of forgotten, abandoned places. Places which are not on the map any more. The trailer George and I saw on our hike in the hills is part of this project. They use ready-made messages from internet, social media, different programs or websites and bring them into a different context. It re-creates its initial meaning and transforms the text into content that is multiple and flexible, subjective and personal.</h3>\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9d7f877941fdc9a31066ff10a6dea668b8334b3f.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"459\"><br>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Project Homework is a series of word paintings. Each word functions as a symbol that represents a concept. The meaning of the word-symbol depends on viewers and the context it is presented in. The perception of the word is subjective and depends on each person\u2019s individual association with the word. It plays with public\u2019s consciousness, its ideas and associations. Remembering forgotten meanings and words. The word DRO on a billboard in the city center is part of this project. Mariam tells me how she asked different people at different times what they thought of it and the best answer she got from a taxi driver.</h3>\n\nHe said that former president Misha Saakahvili was about to make a speech for new year on the video screen where our text was now. Then prime minister and Sakashvili's archenemy Bidzina Ivanishvili did not allow it and he burned it down. As a result, Saakashvili was angry and wrote DRO on the billboard. And that's what I like. Our work doesn't have any author, my connection to the text ends when we make it.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Right now they are working on projects related to forgotten knowledge.</h3>\n\nWe are creating the museum of superstition, The Batumi Backyard Stories, collecting all the knowledge of the people living there. It is more ethnographical or anthropological kind of research, and then we translate it to visual and artistic language. We are continuing the ghosts museum project in Garikula. We are collecting stories from the people in the area, from the villages, and translating it to visual language. But is more informative, it should have an informative outcome. It is kind of subjective. It is knowledge and lifestyle of people what is disappearing. The legends, and how this influences the people living there.\n\nAt the moment we are trying to get funding for projects which are directly connected to urban development and architecture. One of the projects is called Re-thinking the city. It is focused on different periods of city development. The project is based on research of soviet and post soviet architecture and divides history of the city in six different periods and themes. We want to realize artistic interventions in different districts of Tbilisi. Exhibitions, workshops and seminars are planned within the project. The project will last about one year and will have, besides the artistic, also an educational function.\n\nAs the city is in crisis in present, and the future is also undefined, it is exactly now that we need to re-think, decontextualize and reload the city for future development.\n\nOur works/projects are connected to the soviet past and the inevitability of rethinking this past for future development. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Georgia never had time to think and plan a future. Most political and social processes have been based on emotional, impulsive decisions. In such an environment, development is impossible.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6de048125ff01fce78e8a49464d86bd8815dcb25.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"459\"><br>\n\nThe Soviet ideology is not gone, it is partly replaced by other ideologies and power. This is well visible in architecture and art.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Mariam and Detu work together. But they don't have a schedule. Inspiration comes and goes.</h3>\n\nWe don't have systematized working schedules. Sometimes its spontaneous, but if there's a deadline it's much more organized. Sometimes when I wake up, ideas like come to my mind, but often it just develops and shapes throughout the course of a year.\n\nWe need to do research and get inspiration: thinking, drinking. But sometimes when I drink I can't work.\n\nThe thing that I hate most is paperwork. You need to do this to get funding or to go somewhere, but I am not an accountant, I can't enjoy it.\n\nAnd to fund bigger projects is quite difficult. When I worked at the school of at the Center of Contemporary Art, we had to make final exhibition of students. The funding was only 300 Gel (120 euros). I suggested to go to casino with this money and gamble together with students. If we would win, we would make an exhibition focused on money and funding in art. If we would lose, we would still make a show: presenting the video which we would get from casino, how we lost the exhibition money. Unfortunately I couldn't do it in the end, but maybe I will do it once. Why? To start the discussion on how to survive as an artist and that only way for getting funding for exhibition of young artists is to gamble.\n\nBut, for the projects we do in streets (artistic, not curatorial projects as homework or http projects) we don't need funding. Most of the time we fund our work ourselves.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Unfortunately, it is money that makes a lot of projects happen. But lack of funding is not the only reason projects sometimes fail.</h3>\n\nThe experience that I have is that most of the people don't take their work serious here. It's more like having fun, rather than working and thinking theoretically.\n\nAnd that is why we are so fucked up in Georgia I think.\n\nAlso, engagement is an issue. We have participated in some workshops and projects which were on urban space, on the transformation of urban spaces. The most important part of urban art is engagement of the local communities. And I have not seen that yet. But maybe in Georgia we don't have experience in that yet.\n\nThe most problematic thing for me is that organizations are finding funding and just doing it for the sake of I don't know what. It doesn't have impact for me, no visible impact.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a95c27dd2c1259849d6a3797c198a18e8c4b66fe.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"459\"><br>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Mariam and Detu work together with other groups: movements and NGOs that believe in similar causes.</h3>\n\nLast January we tried a collaboration of groups working in urban problematics: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Tbilisitrees?fref=ts\">Guerrilla Gardening</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/IarePekhit?fref=ts\">Iare Pekhit</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TiflisHamkari?fref=ts\">Tiflis Hamkari</a>, and some other groups. The first try failed. Now are only four or five organizations left that decided to work together.\n\nBut I don't know. It is sometimes impossible to work together. Someone always has different ideas or different thoughts, and discussion doesn't exist here. Everybody just goes with their direction and doesn't want to share the ideas. Maybe also, you know, it is an issue of time, experience. It may also be fear. It is often a communication problem.\n\nBut when you are struggling and you have the same aim, you have to leave your ego behind. We can have a different background, different ideas, when you have a difficult situation as we have here in Georgia now, in every field, why should you not collaborate and work together?\n\nAfter the flood in Tbilisi on the 13th of June we have once more discovered that government and city hall are totally impotent and its time to take initiative in our own hands. Its time to change, its time to act.\n\nAnd although engagement of civil society is really poor in Georgia, we together with other activists decided to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/aighekalaki?pnref=story\">start a new movement </a>which wont ask people to gather in front of city hall but to act.\n\nWe are trying to focus on different problematic issues as: domination of cars, unsafe city, uncontrolled investments and new buildings, lack of green spaces.\n\nWe already started to give some examples how to reclaim the city: we have blocked one of the sidewalks with <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/aighekalaki/photos/a.837354986360426.1073741827.837263149702943/837354996360425/?type=1&amp;theater\">flower pots made out of tires.</a> Parking on sidewalks in Tbilisi is allowed, so to walk in street especially with children or for old people becomes more and more dangerous as cars are sometimes even driving really fast(on sidewalks!) sometimes sidewalks are just blocked with cars and one has to cross the street or walk over the cars. So we made a video instruction: how easy it is to occupy sidewalk. Officers tires were moved after one day and plants were through away. But video was shared in Facebook hundred times and other people made the same in different streets.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/aighekalaki/photos/a.837356636360261.1073741828.837263149702943/837354856360439/?type=1&amp;theater\">We are also marking different places with stencils</a>: here once was public pool or here once was a market. On places where instead of different public spaces now monster buildings are build.\n\nIn September, in one of the problematic areas of the city, the former hippodrome, we are planning a big event. We call it ideas laboratory, ideas fair Conquer the city. This will be a kind of exhibition. An open call will be announced and students, artists, architects, urbanists or stay-at-home moms and dads, anybody who thinks that city needs help, will be invited to present their ideas on platform. For example, one person wants to make a garden on a garage in front of his block but doesn't have funding or just needs help. He/she can bring the visualized idea to fair where we also invite different funds and companies. We want to help people realize those projects. To start change from small scale. To create a different form of resistance. To reclaim the city. And yep, we have to start from our street, or yard, or block.\n\nWe have to act, we have to change.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/d/d211de1b85c53cf4a39344b445acef5a5a103891.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"459\"><br>", "created_at": "2015-07-28 00:04:55", "updated_at": "2018-06-05 14:47:48.972717", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2530, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 91.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17209, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 716, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Care workers at risk of poverty</b>\n\nThanks for sharing the links, from the ministry's communication I picked up on something new: \"The question of women's employment is thus closely linked to the question of the social organization of care work\" So the risk is that the more care work you do around the house, the more you risk being paid\u00a0less because of inability to take up fulltime work and provide for yourself at an old age..?\n\nOn the other side,\u00a0unpaid care\u00a0work it's somehting many of us do in our lives - out of love, pleasure, even a sense of\u00a0duty as Alex pointed out in his story of <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2d1d8kj\">refugee\u00a0volunteering</a>.

Earth is the oldest construction material, and in Katmandu has certainly stood several earthquakes for hundreds of years. It is a technology that required a certain amount of maintenances. In the past elements were used to be replaced before failure. \u00a0\n\nNepal, like Iran, Peru, and California are earthquake zones, and a common conclusion of the failure of the old structures is the lack of maintenance.\u00a0 (Of the new usually are design and construction quality that usually leads to changes in the building codes). \u00a0\n\nMud and mortar cannot be exiled!!! \u00a0If you have the chance to visit Lima, Cusco, Sana\u2019a or Santa Monica you will be in the presence of very well kept earthen buildings that have survived earthquakes and are still standing; of course they needed a seismic retrofitting, but guess what. It has been done using the same traditional materials.\u00a0 The Peruvian Building Code, as well as the California seismic\u00a0safety code, provisions for earthen architecture design.\n\nIn brief: is not the material, and in the new earthen buildings is mostly the poor construction quality and lack of technical direction since nowadays is hard to find competent adobe masons anywhere in the world but in Peru and Morocco. Well, I met one in Santa Barbara who takes care of the Spanish Presidio, but his fees are unaffordable.\n\nBrick are not stronger because of the cement mortar, without reinforcement is even weaker that earth in case of a quake. Their downturns are the uses of fertile soil, low-resistance if their not factory made, excessive use of energy to fire the brick kiln and the finite particulates they create affect the air quality.\n\nOne advantage of earthen construction is that requires minimum skills and allows self-construction techniques and communal participation. In many Andean villages like this one in Puno, close to Bolivia\u00a0 (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcOo_15fP-I\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcOo_15fP-I</a>) building a house involves all the community.\n\n2.\n\nSome areas of mayor cities and intermediate towns night nor be suitable for earthen architecture, in this case the new structures has to acknowledge he past and the always changing lifestyle. New materials are more expensive and require more technical advise; and as Natalia states, has to consider flexibility and adaptability. In this regards the experiences of PREVI in Peru and Elemental in Chile are just extraordinary. Instead of giving you a full little house, you get half, you will finish as you wish, as money comes by, as babies arrive. But more than shell-houses, it is important to organize then to allow the creation of organic public spaces; but organic by design.

Heritage sites can follow the procedures of their emergency plans. Hope there is some on going, if not; at least stabilize them to avoid further damage and plan some actions.\n\nIs our obligation to pass to the next generation what we have received. Without culture a nation perishes, we will be alive but empty without the ability for being stroke by beauty.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-01 08:15:43", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:27.131451", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 624, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 15.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2551, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26657, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 6096, "post_number": 7, "raw": "Noted.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-02-04 13:01:06", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:27.613341", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 3, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 458, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 425, "post_number": 1, "raw": "We try to patch together a VERY SIMPLE solution for edgeryders who, while they don't want or need to encrypt all their email, still occasionally need secure email; or who are simply curious about secure communication, but have limited time or skills.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-12-29 15:43:38", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:00.722828", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 45, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22813, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1349, "post_number": 29, "raw": "<b>Le ROI de la cr\u00e9ation artistique a-t-il d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 calcul\u00e9?</b>\n\nAu Qu\u00e9bec, on s\u00e9pare les deux processus de conception.\n\nPour le secteur des arts visuels, d'une part il y a les \"artistes professionnels\" reconnus au sens de la Loi comme des cr\u00e9ateurs, et d'autre part, euh... l'autre type de conception dont tu parles ne semble pas avoir d'\u00e9quivalent dans le r\u00e9seau des centres d'artistes, l\u00e0 o\u00f9 il s'effectue de l'<em>innovation sauvage</em>. Ce ne sont pas des galeries d'art, ni des centres d'exposition, donc la production culturelle demeure \u00e0 diffusion limit\u00e9e, dans l'enceinte du centre d'artiste, ou alors dans le cadre d'une tourn\u00e9e dans plus d'un centre d'artistes. Il est probable qu'une infime proportion de cette production (je dirais m\u00eame pas du tout) se rend jusqu'aux industries culturelles.\n\nElles \u00e9mergent, les nouvelles id\u00e9es <em>pures</em>. Il y en a des multitudes, dans ce genre de r\u00e9seau.\n\nComme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9 dans un autre de mes commentaires, le financement (c'est-\u00e0-dire les politiques publiques) sont con\u00e7ues de telle sorte que les projets pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par les artistes qui recevront un soutien financier du gouvernement doivent se r\u00e9aliser \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur d'une ann\u00e9e. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 indiqu\u00e9 dans un bilan (sur l'\u00e9tat des arts visuels) que cela nuisait grandement \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation et \u00e0 l'innovation.\n\nPar ailleurs, les infrastructures sont quasi existantes pour la diffusion de ces id\u00e9es. Donc elles sont produites, et elles existent. Mais elles risquent de s'\u00e9teindre, apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9ph\u00e9m\u00e8rement expos\u00e9es dans les centres, faute d'avoir pu \u00eatre capt\u00e9es pour une plus large diffusion et diss\u00e9mination.\n\nLes mus\u00e9es diffusent d'autres types d'oeuvres de cr\u00e9ation que ce qui est g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 dans le r\u00e9seau des centres d'artistes.\n\nCes artistes doivent exercer une certaine influence sur d'autres types de cr\u00e9ateurs. Des concepteurs de jeux vid\u00e9o, ou des designer de mode, ou des architectes, etc. Il n'y a pas beaucoup d'argent investi dans ce secteur de cr\u00e9ation, les arts visuels \u00e9tant le parent pauvre du budget allou\u00e9 \u00e0 la culture. Peut-\u00eatre que des \u00e9tudes ont eu lieu \u00e0 ce sujet. Je n'ai jamais rien vu de tel. Ils ont calcul\u00e9 le revenu moyen des artistes, le pourcentage d'augmentation des cachets qui leur sont vers\u00e9s, les retomb\u00e9es \u00e9conomiques pour chaque dollar investi. Ce genre de choses. Mais \u00e0 ma connaissance, il n'y a pas eu de tentative d'\u00e9valuation du v\u00e9ritable ROI de la cr\u00e9ation artistique (\u00e0 part les retomb\u00e9es \u00e9conomiques) sur l'ensemble de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, et par quels canaux et m\u00e9canismes cela s'effectue.\n\nLe minist\u00e8re de la Culture comporte des association r\u00e9gionales qui regroupent toutes les disciplines de cr\u00e9ation. Ces associations ont des sites Internet avec une page pour chaque artiste membre. Chacun des artistes doit par ailleurs de nos jours avoir construit son site Internet personnel. L'utilisation des m\u00e9dias sociaux gagne graduellement en popularit\u00e9 dans ce secteur.

Main difference is using project names of current projects as categories, to clearly mark the most active areas of the site.\n\nThe main advantage of the proposal below is that, in contrast to the prior version, now the primary navigation system does not steer people to \"dead places\" on the platform.\n\n<strong>Edgeryders platform components:</strong> Same as in the original proposal at the thread start.\n\n<strong>Proposed Discourse category system:</strong> The principle is to use project names of current Edgeryders projects (OpenCare, MENA Youth Platform, \u2026) as first-level categories, plus another one called \"Completed Challenges\". All of these first-level categories group together \"challenges\", which we implement as second-level categories. Now \"challenges\" we define as \"common, focused efforts around a topic, set of issues, or project\". This definition allows to have second-level categories for \"traditional\" challenges like \"How to make a living\", but also for user-created activities like Open Insulin. (Users would not be able to create these second-level categories for challenges themselves, but users serious about that will know how to get in touch to request we do it. And we don't want categories for non-serious user-generated projects anymore.) The naming scheme for challenges has to be discussed. For example, if we decide it should always be a short question, \"Open Insulin\" would appear as \"How to make Insulin cheap and accessible?\" for example.\n\nOnce a project ends, the challenges it contains are re-assigned to parent category \"Completed Challenges\". The name \"Completed Challenges\" is much nicer than \"Archive\", as it points to an achievement. People would still be able to comment on existing topics there (while being aware these topics are not really active), but could not create new threads in there. All existing content of former projects would be sorted into 30-40 finished such \"challenges\".\n\nThis two-level category system has the advantages that (1) it tucks away no-longer-active content into one category \"Completed Challenges\", so mostly out of sight, (2) it makes Discourse provide a category page for a current project, listing its challenges as sub-categories, and its most recent topics and replies. We would extend this page to be the project's landing page, by including custom intro text and graphics. By letting only admins create topics in the first-level category (but letting everyone comment on them), this category can be used for instructions and meta-level discussions about the project itself, while all actual content goes into second-level categories (challenges).\n\n<strong>Edit:</strong> Regarding category names, there is a little problem that Discourse expects them to be very short (2-3 words), cutting off the rest when presenting them in the menu etc.. However, it also shows a longer 200-character description below the name in the category list page. A proposal would be to use two-word and three-word category names (\"Healthcare Challenge\", \"Food Growing Challenge\", \"Accommodation Challenge\"), and longer question-style descriptions in the 200-character space provided for that.\n\nProposed list of categories to illustrate, with MENA Youth Platform and Open Care as the current projects:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>MENA Youth Platform\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Challenge: Building us an online home (The place for co-creating the Discourse platform based on the first prototype. Nice to frame this as a challenge.)</li>\n\n<li>Challenge: How to access healthcare in the MENA region?</li>\n\n<li>Challenge: \u2026</li>\n\n<li>\u2026 (4-9 in total)</li>\n\n</ol>\n</li>\n\n<li>OpenCare\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Challenge: \u2026</li>\n\n<li>\u2026 (4-9 in total)</li>\n\n</ol>\n</li>\n\n<li>Completed Challenges\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>How to make a living</li>\n\n<li>\u2026 (30-40 more, only visible in the /categories full category listing)</li>\n\n</ol>\n</li>\n\n<li>Campfire. (Special category, like in the original proposal at thread start.)</li>\n\n<li>Events. (Special category, like in the original proposal at thread start.)</li>\n\n<li>Blog. (Special category, like in the original proposal at thread start.)</li>\n\n<li>Staff (Special category, like in the original proposal at thread start. Only visible to members.)\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Edgeryders Admin</li>\n\n<li>MENA Youth Platform</li>\n\n<li>OpenCare</li>\n\n<li>\u2026 (coordination groups of past projects here)</li>\n\n</ol>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<strong>Proposed Discourse tagging system:</strong> We use tags for \"aggregating editorialized content\" as Alberto proposed. \"Editorialized\" would mean that normal users cannot, or at least normally would not, do any tagging.  (So there will be no tagging field in the reply form. This can be implemented by setting \"Settings \u2192 Tags \u2192 min trust level to tag topics: 4\" and \"Settings \u2192 Tags \u2192 min trust to create tag: 4\", making these accessible only to manually promoted users of the highest trust level \u2013 which only mods / admins would get.)\n\nSo, moderators / admins, and mostly our soon-to-be-hired content organizer, do the tagging. Alternatively, we can allow users to also add tags, but would keep their tags separate from the higher-quality ones created by moderators / admins, and only use the latter for providing alternative means of navigation on the site in the form of diagrams etc.. There will be a policy telling how to tag: Either select tags from our three taxonomies (project names, EarthOS, wellbeing), or create a new one (that fits the requirements) and add it to one of these three taxonomies.\n\nWe'd employ three different tagging systems in parallel using tags, providing three alternative ways of navigation in addition to the Discourse category system:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>Project names.</strong> As proposed above. Keeps project content together even after the project ends and its category is dissolved. Ordinary users may be able to tag with project names. (Can be done by configuring the parent tags of all other Discourse tag groups as \"staff tags\".)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Aspects of wellbeing.</strong> Referring to Nadia's diagram \"<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1v61PetnO7TirXBovMUUhoQ7XoYcXcFak6AWwJhzBaMw/edit#slide=id.g1e5a4a1061_0_220\">aspects of wellbeing</a>\".</li>\n\n<li><strong>EarthOS ontology.</strong> This is based on a \"physical containment hierarchy\" of all equipment needed for a complete Open Village. This navigation system expresses the focus on the Open Village vision. (At a later date, this tagging system would be presened in the form of an interactive diagram, using custom Ruby code. Parts would unfold as the user drills down into the hierarchy more. At each node of that diagram, it would be automatically shown how many topics, Open Village specs and Open Village packages belong here, with links to them all.

The project was one that I made space for in a very commercial context. One in which the expectation of the attendees was to be consumers of knowledge served by academics and business profiles- what is sometimes referred to as the dog-and-pony show :)\n\nI think we did a very good job of building real participation and engagement from the facilitators by involving them in acually designing the workshops from scratch on a shared google doc and via skype chats (chats work waaaaaay better than video or calls for this kind of collective brainstorming). The workshop participants we only involved in a way as consumers towards the end of the process. Part of this was due to the sheer volume of work involved in organising the 250 person conference and exhibition with a tiny team. Part of it was just lack of awareness about what we wanted to happen after the actual event! You know, too myopic.\n\nMm, I think ethics spread. So say someone is putting a lot of work and energy and making a contribution to something I am working on and generating extra value for me. First of all I try to give gratitude in public, acknowledge their contribution. Also I keep my eyes open for opportunities that come my way and try to share them with that person, whether it's paid work or the opportunity to get visibility for the work they are doing. If I know they are trying to get into a space or context I'll try to help if I can, even if that takes time to do.\n\nMm the hard thing about using certain proprietary platforms is that I don't necessarily trust them. FB changed the terms of service just as a friend's initiative that was heavily based on it started to scale. It's a private company and you're not paying for the service, which is problematic for me...but you're right.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-18 21:26:25", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:35.627621", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 362, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5282, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5249, "post_number": 1, "raw": "The speakers page looks very messy.

Edgeryders aimed to have at least 10 community members getting paid for building or supporting work at the edge.</strong>\n\n<strong>So far our small company has supported the work of 7 community members (not including ER directors) in the Futurespotters project</strong>, in areas like community <a href=\"/t/paid-work-opportunities-for-online-community-builders-in-armenia-egypt-and-georgia/2491\">engagement</a>, social media and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER4B1chhnco&amp;list=PLVjndg_tw3Gkwdojf_9uJ0tjQFBFOLYjt&amp;index=2\">videography</a>, and network <a href=\"/t/research-team-kickstarting-network-analysis/3012\">research</a>. About 15 got travel grants to join the conference in Tbilisi last month. <strong>Additionally, we supported with small stipends 12 unMonasterians</strong> \u2013 and many more could enjoy free accommodation at the unMonastery. <strong>This means we have channeled support in hard cash to 19 community members, well in excess of last year's goal.</strong>\u00a0\n\n2014 is not over and more is in the pipeline: at least half a dozen Edgeryders are about to help with this year\u2019s annual event coordination and onsite logistics, community engagement in Matera and the region, and traveling to speak in various fora (calls coming up soon).\n\nAll this is temporary paid work, but guess what? Being in the right network helps one become more resilient as a professional (just <a href=\"http://goo.gl/AsO4ZS\">ask Inge</a>!) We want to do much more and raise our stakes.

He studied for four years at the university, but on arriving here he couldn\u2019t continue his studies because of his status of refugee in Europe. Still he came to the <a href=\"/t/open-change-workshop-brussels-a-symposium/508\">workshop in Brussels</a> and we are all really thankful for his disruptive thinking and propositions that helped us think out of the box and see our Western society from another perspective.</em>\n\n<strong>About alternatives to our healthcare system: </strong>\n\nIn Syria we have an \u2018islamic solidarity\u2019 in society that creates a kind of health system without organization, like you have to give a part of your money to the poor, you have social care system that is organized by the people itself. If you haven\u2019t fastened for one day, you have to give food to 64 people. Every doctor works one day a week for free. That is how we can survive under a dictatorship. \u00a0We are already prepared for any kind of chaos, it is made for any kind of situation and is part of our cultural heritage.\n\nI want to see the whole of society as one body, but here everybody lives in his box, I call this\u00a0\"boxpeople\". You live together but you don\u2019t really live together. You are online, but not connected, we have to discuss, to see each other more. This is my new society, so i want to care as much about this now then how I cared about my society in Syria.\n\n\u00a0For exemple the old people are separated from the rest of the adults, they don\u2019t have a connection. Why do you do that? We don\u2019t talk about generational society, we don\u2019t attach value to\u00a0the older people\u00a0here and that makes me worry. I hear a lot about that here we work a lot about societal diversity, but not generational diversity\n\n<strong>About people sleeping in the streets:</strong>\n\nOne of the first things I noticed in Brussels is that a lot of people are living in the streets. Why are they living in the streets, don\u2019t they have families to take care of them? Where are the families of the homeless people? I never saw anyone homeless in Syria, or living on a mattress. How did it happen?\n\n<em>Some of the participants responded later on:\u00a0</em>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>the core family concept has been broken down - after uni and growing up you have to support yourself; so there is no glue which keeps family together</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>in North Africa systems are weak - so there has always been a cultural support; whereas in the West the system is supposed to take care of everything</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\"Free, but alone.\" vs. \"Belonging,\u00a0but coerced\" Comparing systems-based\u00a0 vs. family-based cultures of care\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/alberto_cottica/status/779632492940783618\">(twitter link)</a>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>About trust</strong>\n\nEverything moves around friendship. I have the feeling that a lot of people in western society start of with mistrust. If you start with mistrust it is difficult to create trust.\u00a0And without trust no skill can be shared. How can we create a better health system if we need all kind of difficult systems to create the trust that isn\u2019t there really.\n\n<strong>In less then one day, Alkasem showed us that the things we find sometimes really obvious aren</strong><strong>\u2019</strong><strong>t at all for everybody. He inpacted a lot of the discussions with his point of views and made it obvious that sometimes we are still a bit too etnocentric about the way we want to design solutions.

But, a technology that enables blind and vision impaired to mediate their perception of their environment and interact with their surroundings is actually empowering then to be independent from aid devices.\n\nMany blind and partially sighted people of all ages are unable to lead independent lives because they are not getting the support they need. The needs of people who lose their sight are many and varied and the support provided must be personalized if it is to meet individual needs. Teaching the blind to see with hearing using echolocation would be a way to make the largest impact, beyond the use of sight. \u00a0The benefits of acquiring this skill changes the way you interact with your surroundings on a daily basis. It decreases limitations and opens the door to new opportunities.\n\nThe Journey begins\n\nIrene Lanza, Management Engineer, CEO of SoundSight Training, knows it\u2019s possible. Irene came in contact with the Scimpulse Foundation while participating in the Challenge Based Innovation program of Ides2quare at CERN in Geneva. The challenge was to design something that enabled blind people to perceive the surrounding environment. It was then the idea was planted. \u00a0Many opted for a mobile device approach, something else called the attention of Irene. Teaching the blind to echolocate themselves?\n\nThrough this experience, Irene had the opportunity to interact with the visually impaired. Through working with mothers of blind children and getting to hear their stories, setbacks and concerns the more Irene wanted to do something to support and empower them. Guidance of blind and visually impaired people is a clear unmet need. However, most blind and visually impaired people want to go out and enjoy independent mobility.\n\nThe environment in which we live is becoming increasingly complex. Even a journey across a city \u00a0requires a range of skills including being able to avoid obstacles on the pavement, to walk in the right direction, play a sport and the list goes on. These tasks may seem trivial, but for someone with a vision impairment, this is a challenge and a skill that needs to be learned. SoundSight enables the development of a hearing talent that compensates for the missing eyesight.\n\nSee With Sound\n\n\u00a0\n\nSoundSight Training was developed to enable the blind to see with sound. Together, with Henrik Kjeldsen and Dr. Marco Manca the first prototype of an echolocation training system, was created.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s a virtual reality environment based on audio. The training is completed with practice in the real world until the student becomes fully independent from the simulation. Further explanation of how can be found here. SoundSight attracted the attention of the Italian government and a number of organisations and advocates that offered its support. \u00a0Among them were, Cecilia Camellini, Champion Paralympic Swimmer. When asked what she thought of SoundSight, \u201cwith training and effort athletes can improve performance.\u201d \u00a0\n\nExperience the world more independently\n\nSoundSight Training is a spinoff of the Let Me See Project, the first from the ScimPulse Foundation \u00a0I.M.mortal research program. It was a 3 year journey that started from a workshop and now partners with governmental organizations to impulse the idea forward beyond the prototype stage. Now it has its own heartbeat. SoundSight Training designed to helping people explore the world more independently.\n\n\u201cThis software has the potential to enrich the lives of people who are blind and visually impaired. Everyone can learn this skill, it\u2019s accessible to everyone and when we design for greater accessibility, everyone benefits.\u201d says Irene Lanza. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nImproving performance, challenging yourself, to overcome limitations, all of this effects humanity\u2019s growth, expansion and well-being. The challenges for the visually impaired are enormous, so immense are the ramifications for those now living without sight, and so exciting is the initiative on the horizon.\n\nFor more information about SoundSight initiative, please visit www.soundsight.ch\n\n", "created_at": "2016-06-30 12:22:30", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 08:11:41.240682", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 733, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 25.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20494, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4649, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Feature? Bug?</b>\n\nWe definitely need to scope this out. I don't know much about Nepal, but \u2013 just by coincidence \u2013 I recently visited three countries that each experienced massive mobilizations that then withered:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Egypt, with its Arab Spring;</li>\n\n<li>Georgia, with its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Tbilisi_flood\">June 13th flash flood</a>;</li>\n\n<li>and Armenia, with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2015/jun/24/armenia-electric-yerevan-protests-in-pictures\">Electric Yerevan protest</a>.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nWhy the withering? The explanations advanced by Matthias in the post are all valid. But there could be another one: some activities are just naturally more rewarding than others for \"spot\" involvement. The case I know best is that of Georgia. That mobilization was led by experienced, skilled activists like <a href=\"/u/nick_davitashvili\">@Nick_Davitashvili</a>, <a href=\"/u/nino_japiashvili\">@Nino_Japiashvili</a> and other Guerrilla Gardeners; they used the credibility and the network built in previous initiatives, like the sustained effort to <a href=\"/t/if-you-can-kick-us-out-of-our-parks-then-we-can-kick-you-out-of-your-workplace/2690\">protect Vake Park</a> from real estate development.\n\nThe volunteers who <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tbilisi_Flood_5.JPG\">instantly showed up to shovel mud</a> in the streets of Tbilisi must have gotten a warm feeling of being useful, of making a difference. Being an activist in normal times requires a lot of skills, from comms to diplomacy to fundraising and planning (look at how <a href=\"/t/better-and-bigger-collective-action/2729\">Nick himself framed his workshop</a> at the Futurespotters 2014 event). But the flood created a space in which all that was not so important: all you needed was to show up with a shovel and rubber boots, and you could start and do something useful right away.\n\nBut once the mud had been trucked away, the focus shifted to activities that require much fewer unskilled pairs of hands. Suddenly you needed sanitation experts, civil engineers to assess the damage and so on. People could still volunteer for those tasks, but acquiring the necessary skills requires a large investment.\n\nWhere I am going with this is: it is likely that grassroots movements are inherently \"layered\". There is a small, highly skilled, highly motivated core of people who devote a lot of their time to them, and are almost professional activists; and a much larger \"long tail\" of people who will normally do nothing, but who will often become active when the need arises.\n\nWhat happens to such a world when unconditional basic income is introduced? The income might make people who are already passionate and involved able to get even more involved. But for those who like, say, to play Go it will mean freeing more hours that will be invested to playing Go. Unless a flood, or an earthquake, happens: then everyone will volunteer. Which is what they already do.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-18 20:48:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:54.191140", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 512, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1734, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 1701, "post_number": 1, "raw": "This is the fourth in the series of research papers based on the community's experiences of transition.

Baseline for inclusiveness, if I understand correcly, is people to have access to what is considered the normal amount of wellbeing in a given society, or have the same opportunities as their peers.\n\nUnderstanding inclusion often has been reduced to emphasizing what we don\u2019t want for our societies: we don\u2019t want people to experience exclusion, and this goes beyond financial wellbeing; it is reflected in the social relations, through unequal participation in exchanges and pervasion of power inequalities, and discrimination. Someone is excluded when they don't belong and are not participating in institutionalized relations in society, and most often this is visible in the extent to which included members project moral judgment upon the excluded, such that they are viewed worthy or unworthy to receive support.\n\nThe Council of Europe has been working on this for the last 40 years, with inclusion addressed in the framework for social cohesion, a more positive term because it focuses on opportunities. The EU focused attention on it starting the 2000s, by proposing a framework for national strategies and encouraging open coordination amongst individual state policies.\u00a0\n\nOvertime, the tendency has moved more and more towards actively involving the young themselves in drafting and evaluating youth related documents. Hence the very successful Youth In Action programme established for the period 2007-2013, which was a pioneer in focusing on equal and non-discriminatory access, containing a specific strategy for inclusion. Emphasis has been put on ensuring that <em>all </em>young people benefit from it, especially those with fewer opportunities like early school dropouts, people with mental and physical disabilities, those having a migrant or Roma background, young refugees etc. The YiA has been successful in providing them with learning opportunities they wouldn\u2019t otherwise access, through traditional education frameworks.\n\nBarbara argues that the definitions of \u2018social inclusion\u2019 and \u2018social exclusion\u2019, emerged in the European Union, could be constructed as involving three dimensions: recognition of rights, a fairer distribution of resources and parity participation (equal political voice).\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>Inclusion as experienced by Edgeryders</strong>\n\nEdgeryders is a highly socially inclusive space, it is open to any citizen and it fosters transnational exchanges. Natural constraints, as Barbara and the other researchers have identified, would be limited access in terms of language barriers or internet use (e-inclusion).\n\nERs aim to de-institutionalize current patterns of values and what is known through \u201csocial status\u201d, or identity which is bound by race, ethnicity or other type of inherited background; not only in their immediate environments, but through political action and civil society initiatives, re-creating identities of others by focusing not on structural differences, but on bridges and a focus on better future. <u>Diversity and integration of minorities should depart from rigid categorization and adopt more fluid understandings of identity</u>\n\nIn Edgeryders posts the forming of family \u2013 through marriage and having children - is an important factor generative of a specific lifestyle, and family borders are rather fluid than bound by traditional institutions such as church or the state \u2013 think of single parenting, same sex marriage and women emancipation. What this tells us is that <u>we need more broader conceptualization of family and lifestyles, recognizing agency over new lifestyle models</u>.\n\nBarriers to work entry and access to stable income have been clearly noted from the community\u2019s experiences, also in the ethnographic report. Even if ERs are not themselves under-educated, on the contrary, yet our ways to acquire skills lie mostly outside school environments; but if for us accessing paid work through traditional employment schemes is difficult, whether by choice or not since there seems to be some maneuver space, for those less educated and actually excluded, the problems are much harsher and in great need for better, more inclusive policies that allow and enable more balanced careers. <u>There seems to be high potential for widening and more inclusive reach of non-formal learning policies.</u>\n\nEdgeryders actions to cope with mal-distribution of material resources aren\u2019t reinforcing structures, but are transformative in nature: they want to be in control of their lives and go for more flexible, rewarding experiences; and their way to do this is through sharing attitudes, not just in hierarchy-free work places, but also in low cost shared living arrangements in times when rents are skyrocketing; or by developing close ties with local communities, at home or while traveling (e.g. chouchsurfing).\n\nThe most important instrument for Edgeryders bringing and keeping communities close is the activation of networks (ERs have high social capital in general) through peer relationships. This is multifaceted, and it can be expressed through sheer solidarity in light of ideals (like the initiative to support people of Greece); or thinking about global problems and solving them in one\u2019s community (like Lucas\u2019s plan for health provision break downs); or networking for shared political causes, not necessarily or better said, least in formal politics (for example as commons carers).\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>Policy recommendations</strong>\n\n<strong>In general, from Edgeryders experiences surfaces a great need to re-interpret social policy by de-constructing categorizations and focus on common aspirations and giving youth the space to build bottom up initiatives in search for a better future for and by all. Barbara adds that: \"the main idea of the edgeryders' governance is the departure from the bureaucratic machinery and the implementation of co- models (co-working, co-housing, sharing of decisions, etc.)\"</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Recognition of a role and voice of young people in society, as peers\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Recognition of young people\u2019s agency, talents and potential beyond the logic of ordinary curricula and market economy; instead of targeting those who are considered the marginalized and reinforcing labels, focus on commonly held aspirations;</li>\n\n<li>By placing a lot of value in coaching, mentoring, inspiring role models, which are provided by both \u2018seniors\u2019 and their peers and mostly outside formal work relations, young people like Edgeryders should be provided with fair access to scant resources, in order to continue to work together and make sustainable work where they choose to put their own creativity</li>\n\n<li>Young people should be involved in designing, implementing and evaluating youth-related policies. In other words, they should be empowered to participate in the ex-ante evaluation and needs assessment, as well as in the ex-post evaluation.</li>\n\n</ul><u>All mission reports on Living together</u>\n\n1.

They are complex. Wherever people meet, there are interpersonal relationships, resource feuds, social problems and political strife. All of this complexity is managed on regional and global levels, on municipal and international levels, by everybody, all of the time. As it turns out, not everybody is equally capable at manipulating this complexity to their advantage.\n\nThrough the ages, barbarians and warlords have taken control of societies of various sizes, sometimes leading them to prosperity, sometimes leading them to certain doom. Slowly, this settled into fixed systems of governance which took to evolve and develop into the political hierarchies we see today.\n\nConsideration of those hierarchies is worthwhile. How can they be described abstractly? What form of cohesion keeps them together? Some might suggest that studying the power structure in terms of power groups would be the most natural approach. But those same would be missing the important point that groups consist of people, and therein lies the complexity.\n\nWithout individuals, there is no society. Without society, the concept of the individual is void. The symbiosis between the one and the all has for a long time been put in the back seat, the discourse centered around individualism versus socialism, about economic independence for those who could afford it versus social resilience for those who had been disenfranchised.\n\nA few hundred years ago, people in the western world started out on a quest to replace the traditional hierarchies with people power. The modern version of this, starting in France almost two hundred and fifty years ago but quickly thereafter spreading to the United States and more of Europe, came from the emerging political philosophy that people had a right to self-govern, and they could do so given enlightenment.\n\nEnlightenment, in this sense, meant access to information. With sufficient information, anybody could make the right decisions - no noble breeding was necessary, no entitlements, nothing except a will to participate. As Plato had put it some two thousand years earlier, \"One of the penalties for refusing to participate in politics, is that you end up being governed by your inferiors.\"\n\nBut the distinction between theory and practice is always rather important. In most countries, supposedly representative parliaments were established, taking the republican approach that assumed that most people would not have the time or the ability to participate in the decision-making process.\n\nThis, when understood from the vantage point of Enlightenment purism, is a fantastically strange statement, and might be traced back to Thomas Hobbes, who advocated a strong centralized government, lest society dissolve into a war of all against all.\n\nInstead some have spoken of Direct Democracy. The simple issue of allowing all to govern without intermediation. It has been described as unrealistic, despite Switzerland, as too complicated for the general public to participate.\n\nBut effectively it comes down to voting. Traditionally, there are two options in any given election. Vote for or against the issue, or abstain, which is mostly equivalent to a blank vote.\n\nBut what happens when we add a third option - the option of choosing any delegate of choice to cast the vote on your behalf? We call this Vote Proxying, and it can be done either generally for all issues, categorically for a particular subject area, or specifically for an individual case. The side effect of this is the understanding that concentration of power stems from the unintended proxying of authority. A dictatorship is simply the situation where everybody has proxied their power to one person - we can in this analysis ignore why they would do such a thing.\n\nMore interestingly, it shows us that representative democracy is merely a highly advanced form of dictatorship, where delegation of authority happens to a roughly equivalent degree to a small number of individuals, who then create their own rule set.\n\nOn the other hand, allowing people to freely associate gives them the power to do things differently. There are certain situations that don\u2019t make sense. Most importantly we need to make sure the structure of delegation does not result in a big circle where people are pointing at each other, so we have to enforce what\u2019s known in mathematics as a directed acyclic graph.\n\nIn this form of democracy, those who do not delegate their power have the power. One could say that authority in politics is like energy in physics - it cannot be created or destroyed, only changed in form and moved between places. Those who delegate are suggesting that they don't have the time, the inclination, or the experience to take an enlightened decision on the issue, and that they trust somebody else to make the decision on their behalf. And those who are willing to take enlightened decisions are empowered by it. A self-determining meritocracy, unburdened by adherence to a predefined structure. Societies are allowed to be messy.\n\nThat was the core of an argument I first made back in 2007. In 2007, the country I live in had one of the strongest economies in the world. By 2008, that had changed. It failed. But in the wake of the collapse, this idea started to get traction, and slowly over the course of the last few years, we've gone from rebuilding Iceland's economy to developing a series of tools for democracy.\n\nWe learned how to do this by looking to the Internet. Over the last decades, the Internet has democratized mass media, with blogs, feeds, news portals and social media. Then it democratized production with free software, open hardware, and peer-to-peer distribution channels. It has also been democratizing knowledge, with projects like Wikipedia and Creative Commons licensing. So we ask, can the Internet democratize democracy?\n\nIn 2008, the Shadow Parliament Project was founded to try and answer that question. R\u00f3bert Bjarnason built the first Shadow Parliament software, which pulled in data about ongoing debates in the Icelandic Parliament and allowed the general public to vote on bills, propose amendments, and discuss the details. It wasn\u2019t official and had no real effect on the political system, but it was a wonderful proof of concept.\n\nAfter some time working on this idea, he and my old friend Gunnar Gr\u00edmsson founded the Citizen's Foundation to manage projects of this sort. One of their first big projects was Betri Reykjav\u00edk. After the Best Party, a new political movement fronted by comedian J\u00f3n Gnarr and a host of musicians and artists took power in Reykjav\u00edk, they decided to use the Shadow Parliament concept to allow the general public to decide part of the city's agenda - the six best projects every month get taken and processed.\n\nHappy with the progress, the Citizen's Foundation relaunched the Shadow Parliament under the name Betra \u00cdsland - Better Iceland, and launched an open-for-all platform called Your Priorities, which allows people in each of the world's countries to use the same software to organize themselves.\n\nBut that was the first iteration. After the Arab Spring started, I started working with some North African activists who had heard of the idea of liquid democracy, but had had trouble getting it to work. With this came the realization that the projects so far had been good at providing \"liquidity\" - \"wassa2\" in Arabic, but terrible at providing \"means\" - \"wassa2il\" in Arabic. So we started the project \"wassa2il\" to try and provide people with ease of use as well as ideological purity.\n\nBut we\u2019re far from being done. This road is a long and winding one, filled with potential for success and for failure. Societies are messy, and mediating democracy through that mess can only really be accomplished when the societies themselves see the benefit of doing so. When countries are writing new constitutions, a common mistake is to imbue it with aspirations rather than values. If the most democratic constitution in the world is adopted by a society that does not value democracy, it will never be of any use.\n\nAs a result, all of these projects, being aspirational in nature, must evolve and coincide with a \u00a0democratic awakening. The people who do care about democracy must rise above venture warlordism and perform the mediation needed to bring about a new era of enlightenment. We must teach each other and help each other, and together we\u2019ll figure this stuff out.\n\nHaving the right tool for the right job is important, but we must be careful: when all you have is a hammer, every problem starts looking like a nail.

In which case his preparation recommendations seem fairly reasonable. If I had to guess I'd say preparing for high tech fuedalism would be much more likely than a slide away from technology. \u00a0Personally though \u00a0I'm cautiously optimistic that we may have solar tech soon that just may be able to keep fuedalism at bay (we need surplus energy for democracies to work). \u00a0Though we'll have to wait and see on that one, and in the mean time investing in food and water storage and some backup energy storage (for cooking and staying warm and some electricity if you have means) certaintly can't hurt as some insurance. \u00a0Additionally loading up on urban survival type skills such as\u00a0gardening, home energy retrofitting (insulation, weather stripping, ect) DIY solar projects, bike repair, appliance repair, DIY hacking, sewing, \u00a0and general barter tactics ect \u00a0all seem like fair uses of time. \u00a0Though no guarantees for all I know $/kW solar energy is just around the corner, interesting times inded....\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-22 15:46:03", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:31.149802", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 532, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 1.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1282, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1249, "post_number": 1, "raw": "I keep coming back to the story of Neal Gorenflo (see 'Interview with a Sharer, http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/share-your-ryde/mission_case/interview-sharer). I read it over and over.\n\nWhat catches my attention is this sentence: \"<strong><em>I had connected to something bigger than myself</em></strong>.\"\n\nI also had a similar experience. Sobs that shake with a terrifying force, seize with such suddenness and fury that it is impossible not to listen, simply impossible. Time stops spinning, it ceases to exist. Caught in this deep moment of truth, everything else disappears. In such a situation, even if the pain is excruciating, the flow of tears is uncontrollable, all becomes clear.\n\n\"<em>Your vision will become clear only when you can look into your own heart. </em><em>Who looks outside, dreams, who looks inside awakes</em>.\" \u2014 Carl Gustav Jung\n\nAfter that, it is impossible to go back, once this point is crossed. It becomes a path of no return. I walked with no desire to look back. Then I started doing some implausible things (even more than before). But deep down inside, something told me that I was on the right track. But not necessarily having been able to generate sufficient wealth yet.\n\nWe apparently have a unique talent and a very unique way of expressing it. There is something that each of us can do better than anyone else in the whole world. For every unique talent and unique expression of that talent, there are also apparently unique needs.\n\nI have yet to achieve this: \" <em>When these needs are matched with the creative expression of your talent, that is the spark that creates affluence. Expressing your talents to fulfill needs creates unlimited wealth and abundance</em>.\" (Deepak Chopra)\u00a0\n\nThis is a law, the Law of Dharma, a sanskrit word that means Purpose in life. The third component of this law is service to humanity. When someone starts asking questions like \"How can I help? How can I help all those that I come into contact with?\"\n\nNeal Gorenflo is doing exactly that! Service to humanity through sharing.\n\nAnother element of the story of Neal Gorenflo flooded me with contentment. He spoke about the art of living. \"<em>When it comes to leading my life, it helps for me to think like a craftsperson, artist or designer. \u00a0I like the idea that leading your life is a craft</em>.\"\n\nI like the fact that after being awakened, life takes on a new meaning, becomes an Art.\n\nIf our society encouraged individuals to become who they are, to find their unique talent, and if their needs were met, would this lead to a prosperous society? What is the critical mass to reach this level? How many people do we need to have understood their purpose in life to reach this tipping point?\n\nEvery day I ask my son what is the most important thing in life. He is 6 years old. He is a little tired of hearing me repeat that same question, like an old gramophone. But he answers: \"Find my unique talent\".\n\nWhy do we not teach this in school, even before learning how to read, write and count?\n\nI keep asking myself --- quite often actually, and this question haunts me --- how can we bring leaders, business and government leaders, to reach their Purpose in life level? How can we show them how to lead from within?\n\nAnother question that haunts me is What are my needs? How can I finally fulfill my (unique) needs?\n\n", "created_at": "2011-12-02 03:38:06", "updated_at": "2017-09-21 13:29:33.725948", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 630, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 15.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1283, "user_id": 30, "topic_id": 1250, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<strong>Most of the leading thinkers on adapting to the economic problems of\u00a0the 21st century are poor.</strong><br style=\"font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px;\"><br style=\"font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px;\">This is not coincidence. The situation globally is, in reality, very\u00a0different from the models which are typically used in the media, in\u00a0academia and in government. People who are documenting and thinking\u00a0about at reality are often operating outside of the \"fundable sphere\"\u00a0of government and other large funding bodies, with the result that if\u00a0the work is to be done at all, it's done alone or with only tiny\u00a0amounts of support.

I <a href=\"http://hexayurt.com/plan\">myself</a>, as I've written about before, have\u00a0supported the Hexayurt Project for years while living as a member of\u00a0the\u00a0<strong><span>precariat</span></strong>: literally those who walk on the edge. Edgeryders.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.worldwidewords.org/turnsofphrase/tp-pre3.htm\">the precariat</a>\n\na social group consisting of people whose lives are difficult because they have little or no job security and few employment rights\n\nMy own challenge today is housing. Let me tell you the tale. I'd\u00a0burned out in London last winter, 2010, trying to start a company\u00a0called <a href=\"http://butteredsidedown.co.uk\">Buttered Side Down</a>, which was a consultancy looking at managing economic collapse and state failure in Europe. As you can imagine,\u00a0trying to explain the risks to people in 2009 was very difficult: we\u00a0were much, much further outside of the \"fundable sphere\" than we\u00a0realized! This is a pretty typical experience of my generation - big\u00a0risks, heavy personal investment, and only occasional success. It's\u00a0the standard model of the \".com\" startup company, and as we all know,\u00a0most new companies fail. But those guys, when they win, win big and\u00a0are supported by a massive investment system. It's not so easy for\u00a0non-tech companies.<br style=\"font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px;\"><br style=\"font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px;\">Failure happens. I moved to Ireland to help start a<a href=\"http://blip.tv/the-hexayurt-project/the-open-factory-vinay-gupta-1-of-2-5336955\"> green digital\u00a0</a><a href=\"http://blip.tv/the-hexayurt-project/the-open-factory-vinay-gupta-1-of-2-5336955\">fabrication</a>/\"<a href=\"http://www.permafacture.org/\">permafacture</a>\" facility at the <a href=\"http://thevillage.ie\">Cloughjordan Ecovillage</a>, a blend of the\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fab_lab\">fablab</a> local manufacturing concept with green production techniques.\u00a0It was an inexpensive, rural place to rest, regenerate and (frankly) I\u00a0got very attached to the place and planned to quit the high\u00a0investment, high burn environment of London permanently. This is a\u00a0very common pattern for people like me, to \"quit the game\" and move to\u00a0some rural location, cut the financial burn rate, slow down and try to\u00a0be more effective outside of the most intense areas. Now this is a\u00a0very good move for some people, and it was a very, very good move for\u00a0me. I love living in rural Ireland, and most of what I do I can do\u00a0online.<br style=\"font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px;\"><br style=\"font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px;\">But not all of it. I was offered a small role at <a href=\"http://hubwestminster.com\">Hub Westminster</a>, an\u00a0enormous new social enterprise incubator in the very most central part\u00a0of London. 1200 square meters about 100 yards from Trafalgar Square and the other tourist shrines, but more importantly, less than half an\u00a0hour from almost anywhere in London. The role I have here, curating a\u00a0<a href=\"http://truthandbeautylondon.tumblr.com\">series of art and culture events called Truth and Beauty</a> is a job\u00a0which can only be done here, a brining together of people and a\u00a0weaving of threads into a fabric. Not everything is portable. Not all\u00a0locations are equal. Sometimes you need the density of the city to\u00a0work the magic.<strong> Come along one Tuesday night if you're in London!</strong> (see <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/search/realtime/truthandbeauty\">#truthandbeauty</a> on Twitter for details)<br style=\"font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px;\"><br style=\"font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px;\">So I'm trying, so far unsuccessfully, to get back on the damn\u00a0merry-go-round. Rents in London more or less require somebody to sell\u00a0out to find a place to live, or be lucky. But the amount of luck\u00a0required typically takes either miracles or a lot of time, trial and\u00a0error. People treat looking for a place to live as a disease: \"oh,\u00a0you're looking for a place to live, I'm sorry.\" And it's not\u00a0surprising: rents are maybe double what would allow ordinary people to<br style=\"font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px;\">live well, and a substantial part of that cost is property\u00a0speculation: people are storing their wealth in the form of housing in\u00a0London, and so the competition is not simply on the use value of the\u00a0homes, but there is also competition on competition, value created\u00a0simply because other people give these places value as stores of\u00a0wealth. The systemic problems of housing turn into massive personal\u00a0strife and distorted lives - immense commutes, lives stripped of\u00a0everything but work to support a decent place to live. In my case, I\u00a0handle it by being a drifter. I'm\u00a0<span>Precariat</span>, <a href=\"http://www.freakonomics.com/2011/11/01/the-black-market-is-the-second-largest-economy-in-the-world/\">System D</a>, a nomad: I need\u00a0a place I can let go of as soon as the money dries up, and move\u00a0somewhere cheaper. I need a place which doesn't freak out about four\u00a0countries in five years.\n\nSome parts of my experience are very individual - my life path is deeply unconventional and likely unique. Other areas are very typical - unable to manage both my personal cause and acquisition of the trappings of adulthood like a mortgage and a car, never mind the fruits of adulthood like children. I exist as a perpetual boy, my possessions not all that different from what I owned in my 20s, even as I approach the last weeks of my 30s. I'll hit 40 with an international reputation as a deep thinker on issues government - generally speaking - cannot handle, with too few possessions to fill a moderately-sized taxi. A charitable term for this is <a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/neoteny\">neoteny</a>, extending the child-like phase of life far into maturity as a way of accessing continued growth and development. Less charitably, it's failing to stand up as an adult. But my perception that the choice was to <a href=\"http://hexayurt.com/\">do something directly</a> about the condition of the world, or push all that energy into winning the social and economic games of the society around me. Many of my peers have made similar choices, we're an unstudied group, a set of people making choices which should be important to government, in that we're exactly the people goverment used to fund as academics, as tenured professors, and instead we're System D, hanging on my our fingernails to the right to intellectual freedom in a land without tenure.\n\nThis is why we need Edgeryders. It's the first sign I've seen from a major governmental institution -the Council of Europe - asking how people\u00a0are managing the new environment. To identify the trend in youth\u00a0unemployment, in lack of educational opportunities unburdened by\u00a0unpayable infinite debt, and ask \"so how are you coping? what have you\u00a0figured out?\" I'm telling you the story of my precarity, and it's one\u00a0data point. It's one space where we'll be exploring, in future\u00a0missions: how are you managing housing? My answer, right now, is\u00a0\"badly, because I have to, because my work is in a city I can't afford\u00a0to live in, and my own morality won't let me abandon the opportunity or sell out.\" But the only place I know of, right now, to push this\u00a0kind of realization and this kind of analysis of our experiences into\u00a0government is Edgeryders.<br style=\"font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px;\"><br style=\"font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px;\">It's a cutting edge study not just of precarity, but of the whole\u00a0phenomenon of being young in a time without abundance. Different\u00a0places feel the pain in different ways - I hear that in Italy it's internships until you're thirty, but that people live at home with their parents and\u00a0that's become OK. In Greece, it's worse and more complicated, and\u00a0increasingly difficult.<br style=\"font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px;\"><br style=\"font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px;\">So. Edgeryders. It's a place we can meet and discuss the issues. It's\u00a0a place to get the data into the eye of government, in a place which\u00a0is interested, sympathetic and asking the right questions - and\u00a0actually wants the real answers. It's a place to talk about our human\u00a0experiences, and about the new stuff which <strong>is</strong> working, in these\u00a0difficult times, to collect and learn from the best examples we have,\u00a0the \"positive deviances\" where the new work is poking through the\u00a0grinding gears of the old. There is a creative edge to this Edgeryder business, places where incredible new things are happening, new forms as distinct as laminates and composites like carbon fiber in comparison to old materials like steel. Something wonderful is happening, but you need a quick, subtle eye to appreciate it.

Pour le baccalaureat j'ai du passer une \u00e9preuve de philosophie dans laquelle j'ai senti que je n'avais aucune autre libert\u00e9 que de me conformer \u00e0 des attentes, faire une belle \u00e9tude de texte ou donner la \"bonne opinion\". Alors j'ai pris le sujet sur la guerre. Je ne me souviens plus du sujet, mais c'\u00e9tait en gros d'arguer sur le fait que la guerre pouvait \u00eatre civilis\u00e9e. j'ai argu\u00e9e que la guerre devait \u00eatre sans piti\u00e9, oubliant de dire \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, que la guerre \u00e9tant par nature une monstruosit\u00e9, la civiliser ne conduisait qu'\u00e0 l'accepter comme un bien, et que cela \u00e9tait du point de vue de l'Homme, inacceptable.\n\nJe suis devenu psychomotricien (je ne sais comment ce m\u00e9tier ce nomme au Canada). La r\u00e9\u00e9ducation psychomotrice des personnes handicap\u00e9es ou malades mentales. J'ai enseign\u00e9 ce m\u00e9tier \u00e0 l'universit\u00e9 pendant 5 ans. j'ai vite constat\u00e9 que le monde de la r\u00e9\u00e9ducation \u00e9tait inflitr\u00e9 par des probl\u00e9matiques tellement dangereuses que ce n'\u00e9tait que par miracles que des enfants, des adolescents ou des adultes pouvaient sortir du statut d'handicap\u00e9 ou de fou \u00e0 celui de personne \"normale\". J'ai constat\u00e9 que ces gens dits fous, handicap\u00e9s, \u00e9taient des objets, objets de soins, objets de pratiques injustifi\u00e9es, objets pour que les soignants, les r\u00e9\u00e9ducateurs soient certains d'\u00eatre les plus normaux. Et puis, vraiment, j'exigeais par mes techniques, de ces personnes un changement d\u00e9mentiel, moi-m\u00eame, d'un tel changement, en \u00e9tais-je capable?\n\nMon \u00e9pouse a soutenu ma d\u00e9cision. Je suis devenu repr\u00e9sentant de commerce pour le compte du groupe Electrolux, un \"door-to-door salesman\". C'\u00e9tait horriblement \u00e0 apprendre, non pas intellectuellement, mais \u00e0 apprendre comme pratique. Je voyais des gens, que l'on aurait class\u00e9 comme \"feeble mind\" dans mon pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent m\u00e9tier r\u00e9ussir mieux que moi. Mais j'ai appris, je suis devenu un bon vendeur, puis un formateur de vendeur.\n\nJe me rendais compte que je ne comprenais pas la vente comme les autres vendeurs, les directeurs commerciaux. Je voyais ce monde autrement.\n\nJ'ai commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 comprendre que ma r\u00e9volte depuis mon m\u00e9tier de psychomotricien venait de ma comp\u00e9tence naturelle \u00e0 mod\u00e9liser, \u00e0 trouver des relations in\u00e9dites semble-t-il entre les gens, les actions, les choses.\n\nEt j'ai d\u00e9couvert que je m'ennuyais. J'ai tent\u00e9 de devenir directeur commercial mais l\u00e0 vraiment ce n'\u00e9tait pas le truc.\n\nMon \u00e9pouse qui est une psychologue psychoth\u00e9rapeute r\u00e9ptu\u00e9e, issuse d'une famille de grands intellectuels, dont l'un au moins a entretenu des relations avec le Qu\u00e9bec d'un point de vue politique, mon \u00e9pouse donc m'a dit que j'avais l'esprit d'un philosophe.\n\nJ'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9 directement en DEA en raison de mon parcours apr\u00e8s avoir rencontr\u00e9 le Professeur Deloche, professeur d'esth\u00e9tique. Je trouvais que ce qu'il disait de l'Esth\u00e9tique exp\u00e9rimentale se rapprochait de mon exp\u00e9rience de vendeur. J'ai entrepris une th\u00e8se mais qui n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e parce que je n'\u00e9crivais rien de classique. Je crois que je lui ai fait peur.\n\nJ'\u00e9tais int\u00e9gr\u00e9 dans un laboratoire commun \u00e0 deux \u00e9coles d'ing\u00e9nieur, laboratoire s'occupant d'enseignement \u00e0 distance. J'ai d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 des mod\u00e8les de recueil de connaissance, de logicle d'enseignement auto-adaptatif, fonction des styles comportementaux.\n\nJ'ai commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 exploiter ces od\u00e8les dnas l'industrie mais bon. Pour le dire grossi\u00e8rement tout le monde se moque de recueillir des connaissances, de savoir les rendre utilisables, de mettre de l'argent l\u00e0-dedans. Personne ne se rend compte que les connaissances sont un bien qu'il faut recueillir de mani\u00e8re certaine, am\u00e9liorer du point de vue de la qualit\u00e9, et rendre disponible de mani\u00e8re \u00e9gale pour tout un chacun. Je me suis oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 la notion de g\u00e9nie, d'\u00e9lite, en affirmant que les Ecoles d'ing\u00e9nieur ne se souciaient pas de la qualit\u00e9 de l'enseignement parce qu'elles avaient besoin de gagnants et de perdants pour montrer qu'elles savaient former les meileurs. En gros les Ecoles d'ing\u00e9nieur se sentiraient minables si tout le monde r\u00e9ussissait \u00e0 apprendre ce qu'elles enseignent.\n\nOr, nous devons affirmer que toute connaissance \u00e9tant produite par l'Homme, il serait \u00e9tonnant qu'un autre Homme ne puisse la comprendre et en user. D'o\u00f9 l'hypoth\u00e8se que la transmission des connaissances est perturb\u00e9es par des comportements, des modes de mises en forme, destin\u00e9es \u00e0 \u00e9garer les apprenants. C'est d\u00e9montrable et j'ai d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'un m\u00eame logiciel pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sous des aspects diff\u00e9rents est compr\u00e9hensible ou obscur pour les m\u00eames \"apprenants\".\u00a0\n\nA partir de ce labo j'ai rencontr\u00e9 la philosophe Anne-Fran\u00e7oise Schmid qui s'est int\u00e9ress\u00e9 \u00e0 mes travaux, puis son mari le philosophe Fran\u00e7ois Laruelle. J'ai appris, compris que j'\u00e9tais proche de la non-philosophie, que j'avais une oeuvre (dixit mon \u00e9pouse).\n\nDonc j'\u00e9cris. mes travaux sont abstraits. Ils concernent la production d'innovations, le mode de relation de l'humain dans le monde. J'en fais des mod\u00e8les pour tester ces abstraction dans le monde et voir si cela permet de mieux comprendre et agir.\n\nJe me suis int\u00e9ress\u00e9 au traitement des donn\u00e9es dans le cadre de la vari\u00e9t\u00e9 des modes d'action.\n\nEt puis, il y a quelques mois, un ami lointain m'a demand\u00e9 d'\u00e9crie en direct dans le cadre de sa maison d'\u00e9dition \u00e9lectronique pour montrer que l'on pouvait mettre \u00e0 disposition en temps r\u00e9el de la recherche pour un usage imm\u00e9diat. Ces \u00e9crits \u00e9lectroniques,\u00a0<em>Tribune(s)</em>,\u00a0<em>Clinique strat\u00e9gique</em>, sont des applications m\u00eame si\u00a0<em>Tribune(s)</em>\u00a0parait \u00eatre un recueil d'opinions personnelles.\n\nLes Tribune(s) manifestent les voies que l'expression peut prendre selon la position d'un sujet dans mon mod\u00e8le de la Sc\u00e8ne Esth\u00e9tique.\n\nLa\u00a0<em>Clinique strat\u00e9gique\u00a0</em>est l'application d'un autre mod\u00e8le d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme \"Le c\u00f4ne\", tr\u00e8s proche de ce que je d\u00e9veloppe dans un autre \u00e9crit \u00e9lectronique en cours,\u00a0<em>L'au-del\u00e0 comme actuel</em>, sur la prise en compte des connaissances de la physique exp\u00e9rimentale pour \u00eatre au monde.\n\nPar Twitter, en raison des \u00e9v\u00e9nements actuels, je me suis plus int\u00e9ress\u00e9 \u00e0 la Politique car j'ai constat\u00e9 que mes outils pouvaient apporter de la connaissance. Non la connaissance exacte mais de la connaissance.\n\nL'Op Gouv me para\u00eet dans ce cadre l'une des voies explorables, l'une des voies o\u00f9 mes outils, mes \u00e9crits abstraits peuvent faire leur travail, u lieu o\u00f9 exp\u00e9rimenter.\n\nBon, voil\u00e0, je suis assez coh\u00e9rent, je fais mon sillon et j'explore.\n\n", "created_at": "2011-11-25 19:17:47", "updated_at": "2017-09-21 12:09:20.801843", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1733, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 15.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6097, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 6064, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/60e959647fbdacc181b2cecf39a4299845ed6245.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\">\n\nHello all!\n\nAfter a bit of silence, shortly before we hear back from MacArthur Foundation, I wanted to share a few ideas we\u2019re working on and ask about your opinion and possible participation.\n\nFirst of all, this autumn/late summer we will host our annual gathering with a different format, shifting towards hands-on work (even if not fully embracing it yet:)). We call it <a href=\"/t/openvillage/788\">OpenVillage Festival</a> and we want it to be a showcase of initiatives like yours. We envision it as a space to meet, present our projects to each other and wider communities (like-minded people, but also regular folks who could be your clients/funders in the future). On top of that, we will use it as an engine to crowdfund, learn how to fundraise and improve our work during hackathons with members of our community. That\u2019s a lot of great minds with plenty of knowledge.\n\n<strong>We\u2019re looking for a place to host this!</strong> There's interest from Milano, Thessaloniki, Lile and other partnering cities and events. We will keep you posted. And maybe your city could help us make it happen? Ping us if so. \n\nLet us know if you want to be part of the village. What could you do to help us prepare and deliver a great experience, and what would you expect from it as an outcome?\n\nAt the same time, we\u2019re dreaming of a more <strong>permanent space</strong> called <a href=\"/c/open-village/reef-brussels\">The Reef Brussels</a>. Or, more precisely, even more than one space, where we will be putting our hands on building \u201creal life\u201d communities, altogether called \"OpenVillage\". It would be a house, a huge flat, a farm, or a former Olympic village which we can purchase collectively or lease for decades and use as a space for collaboration, experimentation and an engine of change. \n\nThere is already a space in Brussels which might become the very first Reef (read more about it <a href=\"/t/6047\">here</a>). And again, we want to ask if you\u2019d be interested in joining? What kind of contribution would you like to offer (in terms of time, skills, material, knowledge) and what kind of support would you expect from this space to generate for your work and life? Or do you know a space that would seem like an ideal destination for us?\n\nI\u2019d be very grateful to hear from you about both, or any, of these calls. You can comment / add a new thread about The Reef <a href=\"/c/open-village\">here</a>.

I am not a better or worse person for my choices. I was triggered to write this post by something Vinay Gupta wrote about what he called the \u201cPrecariat\u201d or people living on the edge of the capitalistic system. And then by <a href=\"http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2011/12/08/acting-dead-trading-up-and-leaving-the-middle-class/#more-2915\" title=\"Leaving Middle Class\">Venkatesh Rao on Ribbon Farm writing about leaving the middle class</a>. So here is my story.\n\n<strong>Deep history.</strong> I grew up in the country on some acreage my father took a lot of risk in buying. Our money, tied up in land, with four kids on an assistant professor salary was tough. We took to growing our own food, planted an orchard, and avoided any more loans. When my parents did spend money, they bought as high a quality as they could afford. As intellectuals, my parents were considered upper middle class. As income earners, I wouldn\u2019t think so. That said, my home \u2013 which my Dad built himself \u2013 looked like something in Metropolitan Home. Always ready for a photo. Immaculate. Designed. Elegant.\n\nI never thought too much about the strange dissonance of living in such elegance while never having new clothes and using the dozen toys we had. (My kids have more toys under their bed than I remember having in my entire childhood, but more on that later.) So I guess I have always straddled the middle class by having certain things be high quality, and the rest be either forgone, DIY, or budget. This is what Venkat and others are calling Trading Up.\n\n<strong>Early Independence.</strong> I started running my own financial life at 13. When my parents divorced that year, they decided the child support checks would go directly to me. I put it in the bank. When I started my sophomore year at 17, I used the money \u2013 not only to pay for college myself \u2013 but to get an apartment near campus. I was, for the most part, a saver, and I continued the Trading Up approach. It was almost a game to see how long I could make it last. Money was independence. And I was going to make sure I had independence. Then the child support stopped when I turned 18, and I had to shift to earning a living and using my savings.\n\n<strong>Anti-Capitalism.</strong>\u00a0By 21, I was in love with a much older man. A theater director. He wasn\u2019t quite a marxist, and said simply that he was anti-capitalist. Consider it personal tutoring in the pitfalls and consequences of capitalism. The world was unveiled for me, as a new narrative about the system and poverty wove into my thinking. I was losing any desire to be rich as I saw that the rich of the past made their money off the poor people\u2019s labor. \u00a0After eight years of this sort of thinking, I was tired of being in a head space of theory. I needed to see for myself. I left the art world for international finance \u2013 the belly of the beast. [If only they had known that I was, at the same time, getting published in a marxist literary journal!]\n\n<strong>The Beast.</strong> Within a few months, I could see that the income ladder was a drug. The more you got, the more addicted you were to having it and dependent on it. It was never enough. There were so many wonderful and good hearted people around me, who were totally addicted to this drug \u2013 money. I decided not to play the game that way. It was 1999. I got married. We were cash poor, house rich on the North side of Chicago. I was making $800 car payments, \u00a0which would have been enough money to live on each month in the 90s for me when I was in college for a decade. I married a man who had bought a house at 28 and started fixing it up. He was a hoarder too, but he hoarded stuff where I had hoarded money itself. We went to garage sales every weekend and the flea markets too. Most of our disposable income went toward \u201cinvestments\u201d in goods. I had the feeling that I could have anything I wanted, if I waited for it to show up. Not because we had a lot of money, but because the pricing in this backyard economy was so reasonable. The 1900 square foot house underwent renovations DIY style, while it also began to fill with stuff. We were way ahead of most of our peers in our \u201cadult-like\u201d activities \u2013 having kids, house, car. But they had money to have a nightlife. We didn\u2019t. Were we middle class then? I don\u2019t know. Probably, but not in the usual ways. What else would you call it?\n\n<strong>Cashing Out.</strong>\u00a0In 2003, we decided to sell. Our second child was born in \u201902, and we wanted to be closer to family, get out of the money pit of the house, and real estate was peeking. (If you need help with drywall, wood floors, cabinet installation, siding, painting, etc, I can probably be useful.) We sold for well over twice what we had bought for. It was like finally getting one big check for all the hours over years laboring on the house. We bought a 4000 square foot monster of a house near where my family lived. It needed no work. There was plenty of room for stuff. And 3.5 bathrooms to clean. There were things I loved about it: the dental work, the two story bay window, the master bath. Upper middle class luxury down to the wood trim. We bought it with cash \u2013 no mortgage. We paid off any debt. We bought mid-century modern furniture and a home theater. We had landed. We intentionally stepped off the ladder. We hardly needed to make any money at all. 20K would have cleared our living expenses. I ramped up my business (writing and design work), and we focused on our two kids.\n\n<strong>Integrity and Guilt.\u00a0</strong>A few things happened in quick order. I was online and began meeting social entrepreneurs. I was writing, for work, about child survival issues in Africa. And my environmental awareness kicked up a notch. I got training as a neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) coach thanks to my core client. My marriage had been struggling for years at this point and finally collapsed. I had a crisis of integrity. Yes, I had felt like everything I had been doing was intentional and aiming toward a good life, but my perspective had been narrow. I went through a massive overhaul toward a much deeper level of integrity. And along with it suffered a great deal of guilt.\n\nThe guilt was accompanied by a lot of gratitude, so I never would have spoken of it as guilt at the time. I was grateful for what life had given me. But underneath that was a guilt over the privilege I felt.\n\nI walked away from the house and my marriage. Did I really want another pinball machine when we had 8 arcade games already? Could I raise my children in a house where their own bedroom was the size of entire homes for millions of people in the world? Could I really have my house be the largest part of my carbon footprint? No. I can make it seem clean in hindsight, but it was messy at the time. Lots of learning. Lots of beating myself up over my choices and their outcomes. Lots of feeling that it was all a wicked mess. And the guilt masked as pride at my frugality, haunted me, driving me toward ever greater frugality.\n\nI rented a small apartment. Took only what I needed from my past life. And switched gears in my work and lifestyle. Since 2005, I have lived off 15-25k a year, supplemented in 2010 by the finalizing of my divorce and cashing out of the house. At first my ex just took care of the kids while I worked on my business and paid child support (which fully supported him). My kids now have nearly every video game console made since Atari came out. And most of the games. A near endless supply of movies and music. Every toy they can dream of (just not when it comes out, they have to wait until it shows up at a garage sale). They have such a state of abundance it is hard to come up with things they want or need. They cycle through things in order not to be crowded out of their giant bedrooms.\n\nAfter 2 years, I decreased his dependence on me, and he started selling all the stuff he had been hoarding all those years. He now seems to make a decent living as a seller on ebay. He lives in the backyard economy. And I have been living in the gift economy. And I feel guilty of that too.\n\n<strong>Appearances.</strong> The outward appearance of my lifestyle seems vastly richer than my actual living. Trading Up again. I fly to NYC, San Francisco, New York, and Boston regularly \u2013 as in about one a month. And sometimes I fly to other places around the world and country. It looks pretty jet-setting. Few would realize that most of this is paid for by clients or other people and that I can travel at far less expense than the usual middle class person. I stay with friends instead of hotels. I avoid taking taxis. I am humble enough to graciously allow others to buy my meals (and then try to treat someone else so I can keep the karmic flow going). I rarely attend an event that I have to pay for. I ask my network to pitch in to help me financially when I need it and can see value for them. I buy organic, fair trade, lifestyle products, but I may hardly eat for several days. I get frustrated when someone in my network asks for my financial support, and I can\u2019t give it when I want to because there is no such thing as \u201cspare\u201d for me now. I can go days without spending money, and I gawk at the goods for sale wondering how anyone else can be buying all this stuff. Or why they would.\n\nI have learned how to stretch resources out. I know how to live a very frugal life \u00a0- and live it well. I could write a book on how to move to a town and set up a home in 30 days on $150. I could give classes on finding serenity when you don\u2019t know how next month\u2019s few bills will be paid and you have cut everything out that you could.\n\nBut I have become so good at it and stopped chasing money so long ago, that I am now at the opposite end of the spectrum. I don\u2019t seem to remember what abundance feels like. I would feel guilty for having it anyway. I don\u2019t feel like I am thriving. I feel like I don\u2019t catalyze abundance in the network around me either, as I use the spare resources I have learned so well to ferret out. I worry that I lessen the resources available to others doing important work.\n\nI don\u2019t think thriving is just about getting beyond the middle class defaults and money-drug-ladder addiction. I don\u2019t think it is about being so frugal that you wither away into nothing. I think thriving is about making more out of less for more people. Life enabling more life. But maybe someone else has a better idea of how to answer it. I need new answers, of that I am sure. I Traded Up a lot. I still need to be mindful not to \u201cAct Dead\u201d too.\n\n<strong>Questions.\u00a0</strong>What I wonder now is how I can be responsible with the gifts I have been given? I have talents that are valuable in the world which others would pay to have access to. And I have denied myself and these people those talents for some misbegotten sense that I was acting with integrity by living so frugally and with what I looked at as high standards. I have a great deal of disdain for sales. Even of my own work, even when I think it is very valuable.\n\nI wonder what it would look like to use what I have and earn what I can and be responsible to myself, my family, and my network with what that brings me.\n\nAny suggestions? Some rebalancing would be really useful, before I start selling my furniture in the name of some grand notion of the boot-strapped entrepreneur.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-10 15:22:23", "updated_at": "2018-06-03 06:08:20.821258", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2346, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 20.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2826, "user_id": 61, "topic_id": 2793, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Some traditions adhere more solidly than others.  Rumour has it that it was key members of the unMo beta that brought it about.  Apparently the floor plans as supplied by the ancient local \u2018Mimers\u2019 support this theory.  The first unMoaners lived their life on two levels.  The sleeping floor: airier, first-heated, presumably better lit was perched above the more cavernous lower floor where distinct recollections of the eating process in the form of memories of Open Dinner arrangements are reported by several sources...  \n\nUnMoaners everywhere mark the beginning of their famous food feasts with an inevitable uvular whooping sound that heralds their sacred mealtimes.  It is speculated that this \u2018call to plate\u2019 was implemented to permeate the thick rock of their earliest dwellings.  Bouncing off the adjacent wall of Tony\u2019s neighbouring Bed &amp; Breakfast to rattle the window glass of the unMembers who hadn\u2019t yet joined in on the dining room Dance of the Circling Vultures.\n\nLittle is left of their precise dining practice, searching their midden heap provides remarkable few signs of life and surprisingly little waste for an operation of their purported proportion.  It has been therefore hypothesised  that a zero waste policy was rigorously enacted already from the first settlement.  However, one contradictory piece of evidence to this theory are the heavy finds of seemingly contemporary glass shards on the adjacent stone veranda.  This could also indicate that exercising demonstrative fury was not foreign to the unMonasterian mealtime celebrations.  It may therefore be worth speculating on what might bring such a conceptually gentle social organ to suffer routine inharmonious mealtimes.  The literature supplies no record of a liturgical contribution.  Some preserved lists indicate that even with a reduced population of as low as six residents, two people were proscribed the task of cooking pranza and cena in an apparently random arrangement of paired names.  Signs of injudicious distribution of duties and of what seem spontaneous task-swapping arrangements make it harder to trace the culture of their Art of Dining.  It should however be taken for granted that dine they did.\n\nAn alternative theory that at least partially supports the disharmony interpretation of the fine glass chips littered across the terrace has it that the unMo pioneers had a difficult and hypocritical attitude to their own consumption of alcohol.  Paradoxical snippets of \u2018unRules\u2019 indicate that while hospitality was considered a key virtue and a cornerstone of interface strategies, it was also noted that many itinerant souls brought with them nasty degrees of chemical dependency; thus, the high degree of glass finds may indicate an attempt to hide an early-stage unDignified consumption of bottled beverages.*  The tradition of high volume whooping may have somehow been used to mask the sound of exploding wine bottles.\n\n* Into this debate may be factored the obscure possibility that an infamous discotheque could have easily been situated in an adjoining building complex sharing the same terrace, and that nothing would materially hinder local youth from engaging in unRuly practices of their own design in the same territory.", "created_at": "2014-04-22 16:30:38", "updated_at": "2017-10-02 14:23:28.024842", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 507, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13486, "user_id": 3402, "topic_id": 517, "post_number": 11, "raw": "<b>Thessaloniki or an island</b>\n\nThessaloniki or a Greek island is better choice because people are more involved.

There seems to be potential to explore it from the Edgeryders standpoint, so here is a first draft, as usual any remarks are welcome! I would have liked to be able to feature many more stories from the community, but as it usually happens there's a page limit. Let me know if something doesn't do justice to your experience or if you'd like more emphasis on it. Note that\u00a0</em><em>I am writing both as a member of the project staff , and a member in the community.</em>\n\n\u00a0\n\nBriefly, it started with the Council of Europe and the European Commission wanting to understand one of Europe\u2019s most ardent problems: young people who navigate unstable environments, who question the return on investment of formal education, who don\u2019t have a space in labor markets or simply step away from traditional channels of participation; basically those who do things that don\u2019t show up in statistics or official reports because there aren\u2019t instruments to measure the type of work they do. And so the Edgeryders distributed think tank was born: an open, online, highly interactive platform where young people from all corners of Europe come together to meet one another, share their struggles and equally the creative solutions they find; and collect everything into a fresh vision of what the future may hold for young Europeans if the right instruments are in place to support their work.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>The community: radical problems need radical solutions. </strong>\n\n<strong>Meet Elf</strong>, he has been living stateless and moneyless for over three years, by choice. Like most people, he used to have a job, as a web developer, but decided to let go of humanly produced artifacts that do nothing but condition our exchanges. How does this work? Well he does things he enjoys doing for free, building software, sometimes helping grow food and supporting others without expecting anything in return and using only sharing as a currency. Yet this comes around, as he receives food, shelter when travelling (across Europe only because he doesn\u2019t have identification documents) or whatever he needs for basic survival, and when not he dumpster dives \u2013 not so outraging when one stops to think about all the perfectly good food that\u2019s being wasted daily. Not surprisingly, Elf\u2019s way of tweaking his lifestyle is allowing him to experiment with new skills and surface needs in communities he didn\u2019t know existed, and all this helps build great relationships with those around, generating high mutual trust and environments that feel safe.\u00a0\n\n<strong>Meet Alessia</strong>, she is a cultural manager and activist. Among other things, she is travelling across Italy to save endangered cultural heritage. What Alessia and a diverse crowd does is occupy theatres or spaces for culture as a protest against their degradation, private buyoffs, decreasing wages of artists or teachers, and economic decay of knowledge workers in general.\u00a0 Inside theatres the protesters organize workshops and debates on cultural commons or welfare policies, or set up art performances, even transform them into after school care centers. While occupying state or private property runs against the law and is criminalized, the logic is that they in fact operate to protect these spaces, and their actions are legitimate from the standpoint of the values occupiers fight to preserve: public goods funded by public money belong to the people; access to culture by all; preservation of historical heritage; arts, culture, knowledge that needn\u2019t be measured by monetary value. Essentially these guys are putting forward a new model of governance, one that takes into account the knowledge based economy and is much more inclusive than the current one.\n\n<strong>Meet Petros</strong>, he used to run an Internet company before the crisis hit. And it hit hard, as Petros and his wife Natalia went bankrupt and decided to move in rural Poland to found the Laboratory of Freedom on a rent-free estate. The FreeLab is a community of international residents researching solutions, offering technical support and building new skills, working together in waste control and electricity (they build rocket stoves or solar water heaters). Very importantly, they\u2019re teaching others to become self-organized and live independently from economic systems. Petros believes intentional communities are the best way to cope with the crisis and really be free as they live \u201coff-the-matrix\u201d: <em>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to reintegrate within the system. We are free and want to use our restored freedom for creating.\u201d </em>\n\nThe folks at FreeLab are not the only ones working towards increasing communities\u2019 resilience.\u00a0 <strong>Lucas, Gaia, James</strong> and others in their crowd are looking into breakdowns of health resources (staff, supplies, equipment..) and are devising B plans. Lucas is a public health physician, Gaia is a researcher and social network analyst, James is a community volunteer and avid cycler. What they ask is how we go about leveraging community to improve the resilience of a place? Theirs is an interdisciplinary model for collaboration through networks of individuals, health professionals and non-health professionals alike, who instead of fighting against each other when resources are scarce, work together to better respond to economic meltdowns. This has an enormous value in terms of promoting solidarity, mutual aid and strengthening community connections.\n\nWhat do Edgeryders Elf, Alessia, Petros, Lucas and all have in common? First, none of these ways to experiment for the greater good are funded or are commercial activities; therefore they don\u2019t exist in the market economy. But rather than being isolated, their initiatives are connected into a larger, virtual network of change makers, people who do groundbreaking work often at the cost of living by the day. Radicalism is a cheap way to try new things that with small probability may work, but it costs a lot in personal commitment and security. Whether it\u2019s re-appropriating commons in mercantilist societies or designing tools to increase transparency and accountability in democracies, Edgeryders are driving the change. Doing work outside the system doesn\u2019t equal being outsiders from the real world; on the contrary, their actions are based on deep awareness of the global problems affecting individual and communities\u2019 lives.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>Building bridges.</strong>\n\nHow to connect the dots and offer support and recognition to people at the Edge of change, especially starting with our institutions? First of all, Edgeryders are pretty much against social categorizations of any kind, whether or not we are the \u201ccategory\u201d in question*. I don\u2019t think many would think of themselves as radicals. During an open debate at the \u201cLiving on the Edge\u201d offline community event in June, someone\u2019s attempt to make a general statement about Europe\u2019s youth as extremist and violent was abruptly disqualified by the community in the room on the basis that: if institutions antagonize citizens they cut off chances of finding constructive solutions, especially together, in collaboration. Second of all, thinking of Edgeryders as leading radical lifestyles falls short from fully grasping the meaning of their work. Edge ryding is not free riding, our paths and risks are individual but highly connected because our success stands to benefit all. We are all part of a common future that some have started to build already.\n\nSo far the platform is home to over 1200 participants, Europeans and non-Europeans, young or not so young. There are hundreds of shared stories, many of which similar to the ones above, and thousands of comments in conversations; in June 2012 we set up an offline event bringing in over 150 Edgeryders at the Council of Europe. People from all over the Internet met the Big Government, up close and personal, to make a case for the immediacy of solutions such as theirs, and they did so successfully. The Transition Handbook for Policy Makers in preparation this fall draws a list of policy recommendations that would make it easier for radical innovators out there to continue to do their \u201cjob\u201d. It starts with making a case that policy makers should come closer and understand the lived lives of young people, and goes on calling for policies to accommodate the isolated, turns-out-not-so-isolated cases of risky transition into cultural norms, so as to relieve some of the societal pressure and stigma associated with doing something outside the mainstream.\n\nEach recommendation can be fleshed out in concrete lines of action to give people in institutions, particularly local ones, the tools to help the young. Edgeryders started with the European institutions willing to lend an ear, and now we want to be lent a hand. With the right incentives aligned \u2013 among others, commitment from public servants in key positions** - we are moving from a think tank advising on youth policies, to a \u201cdo thank\u201d that multiplies positive experiences and puts transformative action at the heart of its collective existence. If you\u2019re reading this and you\u2019d like to be part of the change, Edgeryders\u2019 style, don\u2019t hesitate to get in touch at <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/\">http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int</a> !\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n*This was one of the project\u2019s research findings. A small research team was commissioned to do ethnographic analysis of all the platform content, structured into several broad transition themes. After validation of the findings by the community, all papers are now being aggregated into a Transition Handbook for Policy Makers to be released end of 2012. <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/finale/making-sense-edgeryders-experiences-where-do-we-go-here\">http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/finale/making-sense-edgeryders-experiences-where-do-we-go-here</a>\n\n**Many in the community don\u2019t trust institutions \u2013 deemed as machineries highly resistant to change, limited in their ability to reform -, but acknowledge that institutions are made by and of people; and that public servants can build precedents for good practices and cannot be discarded as untrustworthy. The team at the Council of Europe driving the Edgeryders project is a good example, it can be thought of doing radical work from an institutional standpoint, and the fact that people like Elf or Petros are engaging in conversation through an institutional channel is a good sign that collaboration and mutual support is possible, and that we should move forward and not away from the radical, in any of its forms, depending from where one looks.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-10-25 14:42:53", "updated_at": "2017-11-13 15:41:57.103562", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1837, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 15.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1754, "user_id": 13, "topic_id": 1721, "post_number": 1, "raw": "I have just dug out my old (3 monts) project.

This is the story we want to bring back for our Polish and European brothers and sisters.\n\nThe plan is to spend couple (2-4) weeks in Greece, visit various places and communities that exercise their freedom, beyond governmental or corporate control. We shall form a small team up to 5 people and gather materials for a series of AV and written publications. Publications will come in three flavours:\n\n\u2022 For mainstream media, we shall go beyond the stereotypes of street activist with a Molotov in hand, or a 'noble savage' living at the seaside, with the grapevine wreath on his or her head. We shall picture \u2013 sometimes harsh \u2013 reality of living in self-governing, self-organised communities. How they get structured, how and why they develop their own ways to manage the social space \u2013 and how it's going daily.\n\n\u2022 For activists' media we plan to show the life of activist (also non-Greek) in various places and contexts. From dark and burning streets of Athens, through village and small town communities, to secluded intentional communities, doing things they normally never share with strangers.\n\n\u2022 For our own (FreeLab) needs we plan to make a series of reports/tutorials, describing technologies used to achieve (and upkeep) various kinds of\n\nindependence: food, energy, engineering and social structure.

Family, religion, law, economy and organization are all examples of social structures. Every social structure, such as economy, has defined a set of specific social relations, which regulate and determine the actions of individuals, thus determining their behavior and thus creating a mental structure that defines the limits of the possible. Therefore, we live our lives moving within the limits of our mental structures, determined by the social relations, and we rarely realize that are just that, something virtual that exists only in our minds and that is why they are called mental structures. Changing our mental structures, by changing our social relations, we can redefine what is possible and what is not, expanding or contracting our horizons of possible.\n\nToday, we live conditioned by the mental structures created by the different types of social relations, that at least in its original form, come from when our basic social organization was small and isolated groups of humans living in caves and escaping from predators. But our environment is no longer the same, it has changed dramatically, especially in the last 50 years. Changes, such as disruptive technology advances, that have opened doors and unsuspected possibilities so far, and yet we are using them conditioned by the same mental structures developed for a totally different environment.\n\n<strong>(b) </strong><u>Economic context</u>:\n\nCurrently a huge crisis, of confidence and trust basically, is sweeping the planet, where an economic model, based primarily on short-term financial incentives, encourages the development of unsustainable social and ecologically relationships. Creating a deeply divided society that is structured by relations of inequality, and questioning our viability as a specie in the not too distant future. A concrete example of the effects of this inequality, one of many, are the thousands of young people better educated than the previous generation, who are unemployed and hopeless throughout Europe and the world.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<h2>Big question that guides the dynamics of the session</h2>\n\n<div>Clearly, the current socio-economic context presents both a crisis of the viability of our current mental models, and also an unprecedented opportunity to change them, because we have the tools necessary to manage our social relationships with independence of temporal, spatial and language differences; tools that also assist us in managing the increasing complexity involved in this new freedom. Coincident with this situation, there is the fact that there are in Europe a critical mass of young people with the \u00a0talent and willingness to seek and implement alternative mental models. Alternatives involving analyze, challenge and change, if necessary, the different kinds of social relationships that form the mesh of our society, most of which are \u00a0based on an environment totally anachronistic to the current one, \u00a0discrepancy that eventually ends up creating the current crisis of social and ecological lack of sustainability.</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>So the question we all need to urgently respond to us is: <em>what kinds of new social relationships within our various social structures, we must develop in order to redefine our mental models thus taking advantage of this great opportunity that our socio-economic context offers us, with the aim of creating a sustainable environment based on trust, where people can develop and use their talents in a spirit imbued of autonomy, mastery and purpose</em>?:</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><em>Autonomy</em>: the urge to direct our own lives</li>\n\n<li><em>Mastery</em>: the desire to get better at something that matters</li>\n\n<li><em>Purpose</em>: the yearning to do what we do in service of something larger than ourselves</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<h2>Session dynamics</h2>\n\n<strong>(a)</strong> <u>Dynamics</u>:\n\nThe session dynamics is based in a conversational process structured by the World Caf\u00e9 methodology. This process aims to gather the main ideas and next steps in order to implement a previously given <b>social idea</b> into a <i>sustainable social project</i> within the framework defined by the session 's big question. Thus, the session dynamic 's objective is to <i>offer some answers to the session 's big question by analyzing how to implement the given social idea into a sustainable social project that in itself is also an answer to the big question</i>.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>(b)</strong> <u>Dynamics example</u>:\n\nNowadays an idea implementation in the \"normal\" business world involves patenting the idea and creating a \"normal\" company in which the owners of the idea retains a certain percentage of shares that allow them to increase their profits indefinitely.\n\nIn the session 's analysis of the social idea implementation into a sustainable social project, what is raised is an alternative scenario, where someone has an idea, share it with others, the idea is enriched by the contributions of others and is implemented by creating a kind of social business. A kind of social business with a transparent operation to society where it is inserted. A sort of social business without shares but where every member, regardless of their original contribution to the idea, is equal to the others to the extent of their work. A kind of social business that is open to new members as they bring new ideas to improve the current functioning, or because its needed more people to work because the social business operation is requiring that. A sort of social business where each member receives no unlimited profits but what is needed to get a decent life, while the surplus is reinvested in the social business itself and also in the society where it is inserted.\n\nThus, the group attending the session is divided into smaller groups. Where each of these subgroups answers a series of specific questions in a specific area - economics, law, organizational structure, etc.. - in order to implement the social project framed by the alternative scenario described above.\u00a0<span>\u00a0This process of answering the given questions requires analyzing and restructuring many of the social relations in our various social structures, such as law, economics and organization. Then, this process not only is giving many answers to the session 's big question, but also, \u00a0the resulting social business \u00a0is also an answer, both in how is organized its internal structure, and its external purpose for the society.</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>(c) </strong><u>Social idea seed for a sustainable social project</u>:\n\nKey insights for the <em>social idea</em>:\n\n<strong>(1)</strong> It\u2019s not a lack of desire and resources that keeps people from performing the necessary actions to reach their goals. The goals may be about reading more, learning something new, spend more time with family, exercise to improve health, or recycling more. The experience of thousands of dissatisfied people and thousands of goals abandoned, show us that there is a common cause: <i>people are finding difficult to </i><i><b>go alone</b></i>. The lack of a clearly designed plan to the goals, and the lack of companion to design and follow this plan, is what keeps us from reaching our goals. Situation that makes us live unfulfilled and without the ability to realize our full potential, thus living a life without a sense of <i>autonomy</i>, <i>mastery</i> and <i>purpose</i>.\u00a0\n\n<strong>\u200b(2)</strong>\u00a0<span>We are using the technology in a way that </span><i style=\"text-indent: -0.25in; \">we are sacrificing </i><i style=\"text-indent: -0.25in; \"><b>real conversation</b></i><i style=\"text-indent: -0.25in; \"> for mere connection</i><span>, and through this process we are running more isolated from each other and running out of the ability to reflect.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span><strong>(3)</strong> \u200b</span>The technology is here to stay and represents an opportunity. The opportunity is that we can use it to develop a new kind of social networks. Social networks that develop real human ties and not mere connections. Social networks that reserve space in our real lives for real conversations, while are taking advantage of the ubiquity of technology and its ability to overcome the barriers of distance and time, in a way that, from the spirit of self-reflection and awareness of the other people earned in those spaces of real conversation, is giving us access to give and receive help, care and companionship of people that without the technology would be impossible or impractical to access and manage a day to day relationship. Social networks that in this way are expanding our capabilities to reach with true sense other people and live a richer social life in ways that before the technology would have been impossible or impractical.\u00a0\n\n<em>Social idea</em> based in these insights and framed by the session 's big question:\n\n<em>Goal2us, a</em>\u00a0new kind of social network based in:\n\n<strong>(1)</strong>\u00a0A social site on the web with the aim of helping people reach goals that can be achieved in a period of one to three months.

Any thoughts, reactions, questions?</em>\n\n \n\n<strong>PROJECT</strong>\n\n<strong>RESPONDING TOGETHER: CITIZENS\u2019 ENGAGEMENT AGAINST EXCLUSION</strong>\n\n \n\n<strong>Gilda Farrell</strong>\n\n<strong>Head of the Social Cohesion Research and Early Warning Division</strong>\n\n<strong>Council of Europe</strong>\n\n \n\n<strong>Introduction </strong>\n\nThis project, co-financed by the Council of Europe and the European Commission is an action-oriented and action-catalyzing project. It calls for an innovative two-layer design on how citizens and resources can be mobilized to foster inclusive processes at local level, by using local and global resources, namely online-organized resources (knowledge and social inclusive models built on the basis of concrete experience). It should address the question: in times of crisis, how can we mobilize resources to fight against precariousness, poverty and increasing inequalities in accessing rights, goods, services, knowledge and opportunities?\n\nThe two-layer project design is based on the experience accumulated by the Council of Europe by running two approaches to resources mobilization:\n\na)    SPIRAL that aims at involving citizens from different origins and situations around the concept of social cohesion and the idea that the well-being for all requires everybody\u2019s contribution and the sharing of responsibilities. SPIRAL fosters interaction between citizens aimed at building a shared vision on well-being for all, and designing action to reinforce shared responsibilities. Citizens and institutions applying this approach interact in the network \u201cterritories of co-responsibility\u201d. \n\nb)    EDGERYDERS that aimed at identifying online creative solutions for the transition of youth to active decent life and was conceived as a distributed think-tank helping to activate exchanges on ideas, processes and results.\n\nBoth the approaches contribute to identify the potential and the shortcomings of involving citizens in transformative action.\n\nSPIRAL is able to gather \u201cnormal\u201d people to share the idea of acting for the well-being of all, while Edgeryders was able to bring evidence on the success and failures of young creative individuals who engage themselves in new paths of transition towards a decent/autonomous life.\n\nThe challenge of the new project is to foster action against poverty and exclusion in local communities, by taking advantage of local and global resources, thus resources that can be identified through multiple tools. The new project requires a collaborative do-tank able to engage in supporting proposals and solutions either presented by different stakeholders and participants acting locally and involved in the SPIRAL process, or, in a more limited and experimental way, by Edgeryders\u2019 members or other creative actors acting to foster inclusion in different European spaces. Consequently, the new project design should combine an online platform -organized by concrete topics- and deliberative approaches set by using the SPIRAL methodology.  \n\n \n\nMobilizing \u201cnormal\u201d citizens to act in an inclusive and innovative manner encounters several obstacles:\n\n- the fragmentation of living spaces and thus an absence of shared knowledge;\n\n- the lack of mechanisms to identify social priorities;\n\n- the institutional and local inertias and some path-dependency in the way action to support excluded people is conceived;\n\n- the lack of spaces for identifying inconsistencies and contradictory demands on both citizens and institutional actors; \n\n- the lack of self-belief in people\u2019s own capacity to transform and change current realities;\n\n- the difficulty in identifying alternative existing resources and to activate them in a perspective of inclusion;    \n\n- a lack of faith in the capacity of local actors to address issues that have non-obvious sources (globalization etc.). \n\n \n\nSPIRAL methodology is providing answers to certain of these obstacles. While a new online platform \u2013plus training sessions on \u201cunveiling the creative potential of people\u201d could address the remaining obstacles.\n\nThe new online platform should not be designed as a research tool or a tool to foster free exchanges on any subject of individual interest (as was the case for Edgeryders) but as an act-search tool able to strengthen local process by inspiring, creating social imagination, revealing new ways of approaching poverty and precariousness, promoting change, all this among \u201cnormal\u201d citizens. The online platform should prototype inclusive social models or solutions allowing knowledge and experiences from different sources to interact not for the sake of pure innovation, but to embed in daily life the potential to respond to poverty, precariousness and exclusion. It should help to rebuild self-belief, overcome inertias and identify resources in order to meet concrete needs identified through SPIRAL.  \n\nThe combination of both the approaches should enhance local citizens\u2019 capacity to identify and carry out action in a sustainable, innovative and inclusive way.\n\nThe action fostered through the project will be aimed at:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Ensuring progressivity, thus ensuring that progress is made towards narrowing the gaps in accessing rights and well-being in increasingly unequal societies;</li>\n\n<li>Ensuring that people are not stigmatized or criminalized;</li>\n\n<li>Ensuring that paths for building common-goods are open, namely through sharing;</li>\n\n<li>Ensuring that public consciousness on dignity as a human right increases.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n \n\n<strong>Concrete project organization</strong>\n\n<strong>Clusters of cities and \u201cindividual\u201d cities\": </strong>30 cities will participate into the project. 25 out of them will be chosen by political contacts between the Council of Europe and the local authorities, as is the case of the cities involved in applying the SPIRAL approach to involve the citizens in defining the well-being for all. 5 cities will be identified by other means, namely by individuals involved at local level in the relief of poverty and precariousness. Although these last cities could be identified by individuals, a consensus should be reached with local authorities and, of course, the action should be embedded in a collective approach.\n\nThe 25 cities chosen through political contacts will be grouped in 4 or 5 clusters, as to facilitate meetings and learning processes. At the moment the following clusters have been identified:\n\n-Romania (might involve Moldavian and Serbian municipalities);\n\n-North France, Belgium and Luxembourg\n\n-Greece, Turkey and Bulgaria\n\n-Portugal (might involve Spanish borders cities, mainly from Galicia)\n\n-Latvia   \n\n-Russia (?)\n\nCitizens of the 25 selected towns will participate in a SPIRAL session to identify their criteria on well-being for all and a set of actions that they are willing to undertake to fight exclusion. The SPIRAL sessions will include a training on \u201cunveiling the creative potential of the people\u201d, as to avoid path dependency in the identification of actions. Local or European innovators could as well be invited to analyze local potential and resources to engage innovative action. Local engaged people will be as well directed to the new online platform as to gain information on alternatives ways of organizing resources to fight poverty.\n\nThe remaining 5 cities identified by individuals should build patterns of collective involvement without necessarily adopting the SPIRAL approach.\n\n \n\n<strong>Clusters of knowledge for action: </strong>The new online platform should be organized in a user-friendly way to support action. It means that compiled and well-structured information should be easily accessible (thus, radically different from the current Edgeryders platform), show the multiple solutions that have been adopted to address the same kind of problem and provide contact persons (with practical knowledge on the subject) and exchange opportunities for action. \n\nHow can we structure the knowledge and the information on the new online platform? The Council of Europe perspective is that knowledge for action could be structured on topics, responding to some of those rights that are becoming reversible in current times, i.e. access to food, access to housing, access to learning, access to employment, access to mobility, access to public spaces, access to a healthy environment (four or five others could be chosen on an experimental basis).\n\nUnder these \u201cclusters of knowledge\u201d, alternatives to accessing food for instance (urban gardens, shared-organic gardens, collective organization of consumption as GAS in Italy or AMAP in France, use of abandoned lands,  fight against waste, mix of public food assistance/distribution and collective organization of consumption, etc) without being stigmatized and progressing towards forms of healthy and sustainable ways of consumption, could be listed, analyzed and synthesized as \u201cconcrete models for social inclusion\u201d.\n\nThe \u201cclusters of knowledge\u201d could be managed by creative individuals, able to gather information on action and transform it into a tool for inclusive and collective action.\n\n \n\n<strong>\u201cUnveiling the creative potential of local people\u201d: </strong>Everyone has a creative potential that could be developed with others\u2019 support. The project will develop \u2013with the support of creative individuals and artists- and test a set of training tools for \u201cnormal\u201d people to act creatively or to actively support innovative action. \n\n<strong>Questions to be addressed on fostering local action to fight precariousness and inequalities</strong>\n\n<strong>How can we:</strong>\n\na)    Create legitimacy to propose and act;\n\nb)    Foster critical masses of actors and stakeholders, including those currently excluded, to ensure completeness and sustainability of the action;  \n\nc)    Facilitate identification and weave resources beyond conventional funding and charities (multipartite social contracts, common pooling of resources) ;\n\nd)    Ensure progress towards stability in the long term;\n\ne)    Allow learning on action, transformation and existing political/financial support;\n\nf)     Reinforce influence beyond the local (legislation, structures, policies) through comparative analysis and networking.", "created_at": "2012-11-30 11:09:04", "updated_at": "2017-09-20 13:34:32.288039", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1596, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 11.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27360, "user_id": 285, "topic_id": 1798, "post_number": 14, "raw": "Oh yes I'd love to run an instagram!

I did not mean to offend you by assigning you to the \"most Matera veterans\" category. But, really \u2013 your original post uses the word \"we\" about 50 times (sometimes royally capitalised). It even starts with \"Just in case anyone wonders what we actually do...\". I was mislead in believing your (singular!) words represented the fruit of some collective reflection. I stand corrected. My apologies.\u00a0\n\nYou have some valid points. Of course, Protocol per se doeth not a community make \"just as the Rule is not enough to make a peaceful, thriving Benedictine abbey\". I make that disclaimer right in the introduction. Thing is, living together is relatively simple (at least, <a href=\"http://goo.gl/J1AZbG\">that has been the case for me over the last three years</a>), as long as you stay the hell away from interfering with how other people live their lives. What is difficult is coordinating over a long term project and using this dance as a way to build ever-stronger human ties. Insights and quite a lot of history (from the sceptics \u00a0of ancient Greece to the kibbutzim) are to be reaped in the recent <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XZCYDFI\">Book of Community</a> by\u00a0<a href=\"/u/lasindias\">@lasindias</a>.\u00a0\n\nMy emphasis on getting things done (\"chronic doers syndrome\") is also definitely one-sided. It comes from my own experience of struggling with inertia, and being <em>de facto</em>\u00a0vetoed (even to get Edgeryders going I had to re-do several times a dog-and-pony presentation to my boss of the project she had hired me to do). I completely appreciate that others might see consensus building, or artful living, or rituals, as more important than getting it done. All I am saying is that some ways of interacting are more conducive than others to action.\u00a0\n\nI do not follow you completely on the \"choral\" part. Suppose you do something, without any help from me, that I really like and would have been proud to have done myself. I am going to rejoice for it, and to feel like I am a little bit a part of it, just because I can see better that you and I shared a vision, even though you were able to carry it through and I was not. Keeping to our Christian analogy, it's like a devout person reading about the life of a saint and being inspired to make small changes in her very ordinary life. Chorality is about recognising the same ideal in the inspiring behaviour of someone and in our own modest efforts, is it not?\u00a0\n\nAlso, I believe you are misrepresenting father Cassian's words (the transcription published <a href=\"http://howtoworktogether.org/think-tank/relearning-the-rules/\">here</a> is only a small part of that conversation. Ben has the whole thing). It is true that the Rule is about \"living together, in relative peace, for a long time\", but the living together itself is instrumental to the faith. At the dawn of monasticism, monks were anchorites, or hermits. \"But \u2013 said Father Cassian \u2013 most people cannot commune with God over a long time on their own. You could go mad.\" In isolation people thought strange thoughts, and found it difficult to tell divine inspiration and spurious material apart. This finding looms large in the culture; you will see it reverberating in the theme of St. Anthony's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_the_Great#Temptation\">Temptations</a>. \u00a0Anthony was the first famous Christian hermit in the 3rd century, and remains the most famous one to this day. Father Cassian was simply agreeing with the Rule's <a href=\"http://www.osb.org/rb/text/rbejms1.html#1\">Chapter 1</a>: there are four kinds of monks, two of which are worthless. That leaves the Cenobites, <em>\"those who live in monasteries\u00a0and serve under a rule and an Abbot\"</em>; and the Anchorites, who have levelled up: \u00a0\u00a0\n\n<em>no longer in the first fervor of their reformation,\u00a0\n\nbut after long probation in a monastery,\u00a0\n\nhaving learned by the help of many brethren\u00a0\n\nhow to fight against the devil,\u00a0\n\ngo out well armed from the ranks of the community\u00a0\n\nto the solitary combat of the desert.\u00a0\n\nThey are able now,\u00a0\n\nwith no help save from God,\u00a0\n\nto fight single-handed against the vices of the flesh\u00a0\n\nand their own evil thoughts.</em>\n\nYou can be a monk (although an intense and scary one) without living in a community. But you cannot be a monk if your goal is not to commune with God. Similarly (one imagines) unMonasterians are not simply people who live together; they are people who live together in the service of some ideal, or at least with some common goal that transcends domestic life itself. When pursuing a common goal, people need to be working together, and getting things done. Hence my belief that enabling people to action is in general a good thing, and pertinent here.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-08-22 21:56:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:04.465434", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 893, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [21379], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22570, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1131, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Filter...</b>\n\nAh, I see what you mean.

In other words, Edgeryders is a do-ocracy\"</em>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Here\u2019s how it works:</h2>\n\nAnybody that has a project that might resonate with the Edgeryders ethos is encouraged to think of herself as being part of Edgeryders. Anyone can propose and discuss the project with others, but also look for a client for it without having to ask for permission. Anyone can claim to represent Edgeryders: people can ask for an edgeryders.eu email address and we will issue one without too many questions, provided the project is not in contrast with the community\u2019s values. If the project does find a client (like it happened for the unMonastery) the person who leads it gets hired for the duration of the project. Edgeryders LBG provides the corporate infrastructure to deploy it: team building, technology, outreach and engagement, invoicing, banking, whatever. This is regulated by ad-hoc agreements between project leaders and the company, because every project is different. Once a contract is signed, the company\u2019s board of directors takes on legal responsibility for delivering on it, just as with any other corporation.\n\n<strong>This setup results in self-selection,</strong> lots of it.\n\nEach individual in Edgeryders does what she is best at and what she is most passionate about. Anyone can propose ideas and lines of work; any of these ideas can get picked up by the community and gain momentum ((but by no means all of them will). This much openness guarantees a very high rate of idea generation \u2013 and an equally high rate of idea rejection by lack of momentum.<strong> Anything that lives through this much natural selection has to be very, very good \u2013 and clients stand to benefit from it.\u00a0</strong>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><a href=\"/company/company-structure-and-governance#companystructure\">Company Structure</a></li>\n\n<li><a href=\"/company/company-structure-and-governance#teamandadvisoryboard\">Team and Advisory Board</a></li>\n\n<li><a href=\"/company/company-structure-and-governance#organisationdesignprinciples\">Organisation Design Principles</a></li>\n\n<li><a href=\"/company/company-structure-and-governance#organisationlayers\">Organisation Layers</a></li>\n\n<li><a href=\"/company/company-structure-and-governance#sowhomakesdecisions\">Who Makes Decisions (on behalf of community members)?</a></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<h1>\u00a0</h1>\n\n<h1>\n\n<a id=\"companystructure\" name=\"companystructure\"></a>Company Structure</h1>\n\n<h2>A structure to serve both clients and community members</h2>\n\n<strong>Making Edgeryders into a social enterprise means closing successfully two very different deals at the same time. </strong>One \u2013 the client-side deal \u2013 entails making a convincing case that we, the Edgeryders community, have the means of harvesting and conveying in a unique way valuable knowledge. Based on the interest we have generated in the last few months, we see this is realistic. The other one is the community-side deal. It entails making a convincing case that we, as individuals, would benefit from joining the Edgeryders community (or staying, for those already involved) revenue-raising social enterprise.

This is critical: almost anything we have achieved rests on that diversity, so the social contract needs to preserve and enhance it. We need to build different incentives to appeal to different people.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Openness. </strong>It is essential that we stay wide open to an influx of new people, with their insights and skills. This means building a deal that works for people that we have not yet met. It also means that Edgeryders can never be a membership-based organization. The minute you draw a line and say \u201cHere, we are on this side, the outside world is on that side\u201d, the community begins to asphyxiate and die.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Self-selection. </strong>Individuals should be able to choose their own role, as long as this does not limit the autonomy of others.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Mobility.</strong> People should be able to move as effortlessly as possible from one role to another.</li>\n\n<li><strong>No veto power. </strong>The focus of any deal should be to empower and encourage each one of us to do stuff. Should Edgeryders become something that can prevent you from doing stuff\u2026 I guess no one would be interested (certainly not the founders).<strong> </strong>Remember the mantra: <strong>who does the work calls the shots. No one gets to sit on the sidelines and tell people not to do stuff. If you want to make it better, get involved!</strong></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h1>\u00a0</h1>\n\n<h1><a id=\"organisationlayers\" name=\"organisationlayers\">Organisation\u00a0layers</a></h1>\n\nWith those design principles in mind, we are building the\u00a0following structure. It is layered, like an onion.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>A (tiny) incorporated kernel. </strong>This subsystem is for \u201ckeeping the lights on\u201d: running and energizing the online community and finding the resources to put together one \\#LOTE conference a year for all of us to get together. Since it needs to generate revenue, this part must be able to find and pitch clients that will pay in return from our advice. People in the kernel need to do the hard work of bringing a social startup to financial viability; they should aim at making Edgeryders their day job.</li>\n\n<li><strong>An open layer of operatives. </strong>These are people that see value in enlisting the help of the Edgeryders community (as well as the Edgeryders name, which, at least in the space I am in, turns out to have a little value \u2013 it appears we are cool!) for something they are working on or they wish to work on the future.</li>\n\n<li><strong>A host of domain experts. </strong>These are the repositories of living knowledge of Edgeryders, ready to come online if the project is right. We have people that hack almost anything: urban agriculture, defense policy, pandemics, open data, social currencies, urban regeneration, you name it. Even more importantly, we have reached the critical mass where one of us is one handshake away from world class, cutting edge experts on pretty much anything. These people are too busy (and sometimes too senior) to work in Edgeryders \u2013 yet they made a tremendous difference in reaching out to a broad, diverse range of communities of practice, thereby driving our initial successes. It is important to give them some reason to hang around the community - and occasionally contribute to the debate \u2013 even when they are not on the payroll.</li>\n\n<li><strong>An outer layer, hanging out on the website and occasionally contributing to the online discussion. </strong>A mixed bag of newcomers, formerly active people that are drifting off, passers-by. They reach the website as a result of engagement and community management efforts; maybe they follow a link from Twitter, and are provoked into a response. This is mainly a recruiting and self-recruiting ground, a vantage point where people can get a front seat to the community and decide whether to engage or re-engage. Experience from Edgeryders 1 shows that it only takes a successful post to establish oneself as respected member of the community \u2013 so the outer layer acts as an effective springboard to the inner ones.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>The first two layers are the people that generate revenue, and drive Edgeryders as a social enterprise. </strong>The kernel focuses on keeping the community going, and this is critical because without the community none of this can happen. The operatives focus on projects, and the projects will be as diverse as they themselves are. The two outer layers provide content and discussion; the domain experts also act as relays to specialized communities that we might need to reach out to. The kernel people work for Edgeryders. Everyone else does not, but is eligible for packets of paid work. Critically, everyone in all layers donates a little bit of time too \u2013 hopefully that\u2019s not too bad, because they get to interact with smart people and the kernel makes LOTE events happen for them. Also critically, we build in ways for layers to interact: for example, recruiting the board by picking some Edgeryders registered users at random. Everyone gets a chance to serve in the board.\n\n<h1>\u00a0</h1>\n\n<h1><a id=\"sowhomakesdecisions\" name=\"sowhomakesdecisions\">So who makes decisions?</a></h1>\n\n<strong>You do. That is, if you are prepared to do the work.</strong> It works like this: you can kickstart an Edgeryders project by positioning yourself as what I above called an operative. And anybody can be an operative \u2013 this is why that layer is open. As an operative, you can mobilize the community towards your project even if you are not part of the incorporated kernel: you will be collaborating with it. I am not sure how to frame the legal status of the cooperation, but from an operational point of view this should follow three rules.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>You don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s permission to start a project. </strong>Anybody can put on and Edgeryders hat, provided they subscribe to the community\u2019s core values. There is little danger of abuse, because, if someone starts a project that conflicts with the Edgeryders broad worldview (\u201clet\u2019s advise Big Bad Evil Corporate on how to make even more money reducing young innovators to brainless zombies!\u201d), the community will simply ignore it, and the project will fail. For Edgeryders to work its magic, anything we attempt simply must be beneficial! No reputation damage either: the fact that an evil Edgeryders project failed will only reinforce our reputation. Distributed quality control, yay!</li>\n\n<li><strong>If you bring in a project, you have to lead it. </strong>This means you have to decide on how resources are allocated, choosing people you put on the payroll, prioritizing goals etc.</li>\n\n<li><strong>You have to give back to the community.</strong> Need a domain expert? Try to hire it from the community. Organizing a conference? Try to get some of the speakers invited from the community. This is in your best interest too \u2013 some of the smartest people I know are in Edgeryders. You can find world-class expertise on so many things in here! No brainer. Also, you\u2019ll be using community resources (online platform, LOTE events etc.) which are maintained by the kernel, so you\u2019ll need to contribute towards those.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Operatives don\u2019t work for Edgeryders: rather, Edgeryders works for them.</strong> Each of them gets to legitimately speak for the community and make the calls within the project he or she is leading. People in the kernel can initiate projects too. In fact, they must \u2013 they need to generate revenue to maintain community resources!\n\n<h1>\u00a0</h1>\n\n<h2><a id=\"whatifthingsgowrong\" name=\"whatifthingsgowrong\">What happens if things go very wrong?</a></h2>\n\n<strong>Openness is our best safeguard against opportunistic or misguided behavior. </strong>People vote with their feet: if the kernel abuses the community, the community will evaporate, and the kernel will be left without a viable company. They definitely don\u2019t want that! But what happens if they don\u2019t notice something is wrong? Or if there is a major disagreement? If somebody else does something stupid that threatens your project as it unfolds? Our second safeguard is the board of directors. We are giving it statutory powers to overrun management and act as benevolent dictator when it perceives a threat.

I would start from the results of the bootstrapping phase, that proves there is at least some demand for consultancy services that (1) use collective intelligence instead of professional consultants, and hence (2) connect the client with radical people on the edge and their practices. I consider this our core business until proven otherwise. Once this mythical advisor is informed about this, I would ask her the following questions:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>What non-billable services (admin, comms etc.) does the Edgeryders billable consultancy work require?</li>\n\n<li>Realistically, how big must Edgerdyers grow in order to fund those non-billable services from the margin earned from the billable consultancy work? This depends on (a) nature and cost of core services as per question 1, (b) margin.</li>\n\n<li>Opportunities: are there\u00a0<em>other</em>\u00a0billable consultancy products that we are not currently supplying and arise as a natural complementarity of what we are doing already? Example: could we make a product to help organisations think like networks? If there are, how do we roll out and transform them into business areas?</li>\n\n<li>How can Edgeryders as a corporate vehicle better serve the community's projects? Fellowships \"no string attached\"? \u00a0Joint projects? Starting companies of which ER is a partner together with the person proposing the project? How does that feed back into the core business?</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nQuestions 1 and 2 are about equilibrium conditions: ensuring that we can do cool stuff without exploiting ourselves to provide the non-billable stuff for free. If this is not ensured, we are not viable and the company will die. People will be tired of being underpaid and will retreat to non-Edgeryders work; which means that no one will be manning the non-billable stuff, which includes the sales; and with no sales we are dead in the water. You answer them by solving the equilibrium condition on yearly turnover, then figuring out a plausible growth path to get to equilibrium turnover. Business types call this \"writing the business plan\". It requires spreadsheets and knowledge of the consultancy business (example: I recently learned that if you do digital communication, 15% is the upper bound of the margin you can get. But if you do cleaning services, you can get 40% \u2013 not sure how much exploitation is involved).\u00a0\n\nQuestions 3 and 4 are about business development. 3 seeks to extend and strengthen the core business. 4 seeks to bring into focus the emerging ER ecosystem, and in a way is about reinventing the incubator. 4 in particular is an area in which we have failed spectacularly: there is no obvious reason why the Viral Academy and the unMonastery are not prosperous little economic entities, humming away and closely connected to ER. Instead, we have a graveyard of ruined relationships and wasted opportunities. Hah. Addressing them is more of an exploratory exercise: the ideal person to give advice on 3 is someone who knows inside out certain markets in consultancy (eg. management consultancy) and can tell you \"here are some needs that these people have. How would you address them?\"). The ideal person to give advice on 4 is... probably someone who built incubator-type stuff and crashed them.\n\n<a href=\"/u/patrick_andrews\">@Patrick_Andrews</a>, I imagine this degree of clarity is enough to engage expert advice, and would be surprised if the average budding entrepreneur entering an accelerator were clearer than that. Then we can call it acceleration or pre-acceleration, but in the end you need to come out with a business plan, some plans to enter into at least one new market (including contacts with people who can serve as entry points therein) and a collaboration model that you can propose to at least one community project to serve as prototype. If you have none of that, you are flying blind, which is what we are doing now.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-10-09 08:18:54", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:34.934417", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 715, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 10.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [13936], "is_liked_by": [2551], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13776, "user_id": 3638, "topic_id": 6288, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>Thanks</b>\n\n@albertorey, thanks and do hope for the best\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-16 18:43:14", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:17.887597", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 13, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [13683], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14103, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4977, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Marking done</b>\n\n<img alt=\"smiley\" height=\"23\" src=\"/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png\" title=\"smiley\" width=\"23\">\n\n", "created_at": "2015-11-17 15:04:13", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:19.703649", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 28, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7108, "user_id": 2330, "topic_id": 5069, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Still to be fully discussed with SMartBE</b>\n\nBut <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VSTtXCPKU2k4qRaDQ_5jfTSDztDqb9ujbMmcXVOmuNg/edit#gid=0\">here</a> it is.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-12-23 11:12:31", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:41.852942", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 28, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10636, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 3176, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Ok: Look at how these guys work</b>\n\n<a href=\"http://corporateinnovation.berkeley.edu/woic2014/index.html\">Example event\u00a0</a>(<a href=\"http://corporateinnovation.berkeley.edu/woic2014/callproblems.html\">send us your problems</a>).

I studied architecture then joined the army for one year -mandatory in Egypt- and now I am enrolled in TU Berlin Campus Elgouna urban development master program. Although I studied architecture but I don't like to be known as an architect - trying not to be one of those \"intellectual architects\" who look down to the people as they look to their plans. I don't want to be someone who contributes in a master plan or a design to make people more miserable. I always have this saying that \"architects are just like politicians: both like to talk with \"big words\" and don't give a damn about what people actually want or need\".\n\nAfter finishing my army service, looking for a job I had 2 ways to go as an architect - I considered searching for other jobs as well, like a math teacher but wasn't lucky- one way was to work in an office where work is mainly making computer drawings and the other way was to be on the construction site. And I had this other saying that \"if you are going to be a serial killer don't choose bullets as your weapon, choose something with less blood\" so I went for a job in the office. Anyway I only worked for 5 months before joining this master program and I hated it, was going to quit anyway.\n\nI always like to describe my self as a \"knowmad\" and \"interest based learner\". Knowmad - actually it is just a \"big \"cool word :) but kinda describes what I do, as I am interested in different things so I always go from one thing to another - like attending a theoretical physics lecture talking about quantum physics and Higgs Boson which till now didn't know WTH is, then working with a couple of friends on designing a piece of furniture and attending an online course about intro to philosophy. And \"interest based\" is when I am interested in something I go for it, try to be engaged in it as much as possible, but when it comes to a point that I lose my interest I don't continue with it - and TU now is making me lose interest bit by bit, but anyway I can't leave.\n\nObviously not all my plans/ projects work, most of them end in failure or in an unfinished state but I am okay with that, it is part of the learning process.\n\nActually now besides Edgeryders and my masters I am working on my own research - still struggling with it - about alternatives for institutional education focusing on democratic schooling in Berlin and homeschooling in Cairo where I shared the interview I had with one of the parents.\n\nSome random stuff about me:\n\nI \"love\" playing football a lot, it just makes me happy and in a good mood :) even if I play with people whose language I don't speak, and the first time I went to play I wasn't really sure they are going to play or not.\n\nI used to cycle in Cairo but now I don't in Berlin (what a shame).\n\nI became pessimistic about the near future of my country, but yet didn't lose hope. So ....don't know what else to add ...feel free to ask me anything.\n\nFinally I think Edgeryders is a very nice community connecting really interesting people -or people living on the edge- and I am looking forward to know you better, also have very good expectations about Spot the Future project.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-09 21:59:59", "updated_at": "2017-11-13 16:51:40.224705", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 673, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 15.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30165, "user_id": 97, "topic_id": 4643, "post_number": 28, "raw": "<b>Collaborative writing tools</b>\n\nI've noticed that own cloud has a collaborative writing tool, which interestingly didnt appear to be a etherpad fork, but from what I remember its fairly basic.\n\nThis conversation, which I think includes some of Ecobytes, just came onto my radar and details a more advances option   http://discourse.transformap.co/t/tools-for-collaborative-writing/172", "created_at": "2015-07-18 16:08:20", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:46.139210", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 63, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23517, "user_id": 6, "topic_id": 1282, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Brilliant!</b>\n\nHi Giacomo,\n\nI just wanted to applaud your efforts in setting up this service - undoubtedly it will make a major difference to the futures of many young people who will use it.\u00a0\n\nI've been hugely fortunate to be part of a university system (Cambridge, UK) where both the University Careers Service and each individual college within the university has its own network of alumni (past students) who are willing to offer careers advice, mentoring, CV checks or work experience opportunities to students and recent graduates.\u00a0 I revisited the network of my own college recently as I'm reaching a turning point in my career (I'm writing up my PhD) and, while I'm still full of anxiety as to what's next for me, the reassurance that there were people I could ask questions of - whether that's about publishing, government, the third sector or academia - did make the challenge of \"what's next?\" that bit less daunting.\n\nAll the very best with your project - it deserves great success.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-02-21 16:29:05", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:10.556966", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 184, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32103, "user_id": 3324, "topic_id": 5952, "post_number": 29, "raw": "Hi @Luce and all\n\nalso someone of us will be in Rome.\n\nsee you\u00a0\n\nFranca\n\nps. do you have any idea about possible dates for the meeting with Commission in Brussels?

Check out </em><em>Marliekes talk and <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/kennisland/feed-forward-stories-towards-open-research-and-policy-making-for-better-public-services\">slides</a>\u00a0</em>.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/4fQqX81WEQo\n\nMarco: Have gone through the presentation and slides... what they do, once spoiled of all the lexicon, looks very much like what church oratories would do in the past. That model is interesting to me... however I am still struggling on how this should be implemented in internet era, to make it more friable and to make it count. I may have missed it, but it didn't struck me as if kennisland has taken any step in that direction. Can I ask you how did it capture your attention?\n\n<em>Nadia: I am looking for a methodology to enable people in the broader </em><em>edgeryders</em><em> networks to contribute to the research project from wherever they are. Even if they do not have any technical skills. So I am thinking of an \"Active Learner\" role that could allow them to set up a similar process in their local community. And then contribute the documentation to the OpenCare online discussion</em>\n\nMarco: \u00a0OK, if that is what you have seen in her presentation (that I missed :P), than I understand why you pointed it out. Yes, learner is a fantastic role. And there are deeper parallels between education and care than meets the superficial eye. I like the thinking\n\n<em>Nadia: How were you thinking about the prototyping process (your bits)? What deliverables do you want from participants?</em>\n\nMarco: \u00a0As documented exercises: educational role games (sort of).\u00a0\n\n<em>Nadia: Because this part as I see it would be about active learners helping us to understand the environments in which existing projects are working. As well as where there are gaps, what could be built/improved. I.e. they would be defining the specs for the prototypes.</em>\n\n<em>Massimo: I see a great opportunity to join the approach scenario presented by </em><em>Marlieke</em><em> and the inclusive networking power of the Edgeryders platform, as we use it for the Opencare project. One thing that called my attention from </em><em>Marlieke\u2019s</em><em> talk is that they \u201cfind difficult to connect people\u201d and the Edgeryders platform is precisely designed for that. Now imagine if the chatter from the dynamics of Kennisland gets connected into the Opencare analytics \u2026\u00a0</em>\n\nMarco: I understand... but that is not a deliverable from laymen, is it? That would mean there is an auditor/anthropologist working with the community...\n\n<em>Nadia: I think we can \"guide\" the happy amateurs. With good </em><em>instructables</em><em>/ templates. As well as through the weekly hangout meetings and 1 visit at the beginning to help them get going.</em>\n\nMarco: I will confess that, unlike in clinical relationships, in this massive exercise, I will be learning with them :)\n\nNadia: Can you help me to understand what you meant by an educational role game? Or rather why you want it/ what you want to do with that input after?\n\nMarco: That is the easiest way I see to have a deliverable directly from the \"uneducated\" (so to say) volunteers. It is like documenting a flaw in a software... but doing it in society. Can we all repeat the same failure experience?\n\n<em>Nadia: But is it aimed at showing what is broken, what could work, both or something else?\u00a0Also, who is the exercise for? Who is meant to take part, who is meant to read the \"results\"?</em>\n\nMarco: Mostly at what is broke - to inform the community of \"solvers\". Otherwise, what happens is the aristotelian debate about what has been written/said, and the solution is typically useless.\n\n<em>Nadia: aha ok so it is meant to arrive at the same place as the </em><em>kennisland</em><em> exercise I pointed to above</em>\n\nMarco: sort of, I really did not see it in them... they looked to me like telling anecdotes (the aristotelic exercise)\n\n<em>Massimo: \u2026 and take advantage of the emergence of concepts and ideas to propose prototypes, to test the hypotheses. Everything the mind envisions feels\u00a0different when you experiment doing a model of it and play the game. Like the children do when they build an imaginary house throwing a blanket over a couple of chairs, then they get under the blanket and play the act of living that \u201chouse\u201d, they naturally experiment further, making changes, adding improving to the initial idea, playing scenarios.</em>\n\nNadia: Hmm ok.\u00a0So you are looking for some set up in which people share experiences and figure out the \"game\" they are playing. A kind of massive user-generated monopoly board game where people add the steps as they go along. \u00a0What I learned from kennisland is that you do need something tangible and visible to people who are not going to engage online to begin with.\n\nYou need a trigger: something fun which can get a conversation going in a public space...One example I reallly like is: <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://creativetimereports.org/2014/04/07/does-capitalism-work-for-you/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1463733931077000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGq3BlP1yO0QxJZ4RiFqfmH4TDToA\">http://creativetimereports.org/2014/04/07/does-capitalism-work-for-you/</a>\n\nWe would need some way of recording what people say, and then doing speech to text synthesis so we have transcripts that can then be posted, discussed and made sense of on platform. Then you close the feedback loop by printing (condensed versions) of the online discussions and stories on paper. And then hanging those \u00a0papers up on a clothing line or on a wall in a public place. With some way for people to reply back/ contribute to the conversation even if they are not online.\u00a0\n\n<em>Marco: Ahahaha! Ok, I was more into D&amp;D (or secondLife) than Monopoly... but that works for me as well.</em>\n\nMassimo: Eventually the game becomes the incubator of a new initiative, organization or even an enterprise.

Her project is called 'Playground for Peace' and has its home in a beautifully renovated three story barnyard between the\u00a0oak forest of Carleberg (Gaard) and the town of Riga in Finland.\n\nDuring our chat we spoke about the potentials of new forms of social organization and Anna stormed ahead with a full description of a project which she has been actively working with for the past few years called 'Playground for Peace'. Her premise is that we have tuned our tools of social organization toward the competitive and thus towad the destructive. She offered that there was as much evidence to pove this as more than an assumption in todays state of affairs in the EU and beyond. Rather than base ourselves in competition and the destructive aspects that comprise the characteristic impulses of 'war', as we do in society at large today, Anna wants to see spaces that operate as \"hubs for the transformation movement\" and with the 'Playground for Peace'\u00a0she wants to create the first of many spaces that provide place for marginalised youth learning to live in both the local and global realities. Much like\u00a0the WOOFers (willing workers on organic farms), she envisages 'Willing Players for Peace' who contribute to \"holding global space for local youth development\".\n\nThe 'Playground for Peace' is quite like the unmonastery in that it is not a fixed-location project. Anna wants her pioneering project to be the first among many and wants to use her initial idyllic location to serve as a home from which further projects can be seeded through template design and fundraising projects based there. The location at the Carleberg forest is perfectly situated being between the town of Riga and the oak forest of Carleberg. It is 5 minutes by car to the\u00a0airport and it just so happens that the buiding is on the path for the weekend walkers of the town who enjoy\u00a0relaxation in the forest.\u00a0\n\nThe barn is an old three story classically nordic design...you know, the ones with the ramp for tractors to access the second storey. Anna really surprised me when she broke out her laptop with the full architectural plans for ths place and told me about her work as a professional architect. The building is truly amazing, and her friend Saulus does a lot of the work there. Saulus is a carpenter and machinist\u00a0by trade \"and a\u00a0good one!\" and has his workshop\u00a0in a room on the bottom floor of the barn. When Anna-Irene lives there she helps with the structural upkeep of the building and runs a cafe and 'safe-space' between the milk parlour and the beehive in the wall on the corner, which she aptly names 'the land of milk and honey'. The weekend walkers often come and sit, enjoy coffee and cake, connect, read, and share experiences there.\n\nAlso in 'the barn' there is a craft studio and small exhibition space run by local artisans, while outside to the front of the barn there is a large green area, \"enough space to run a small-medium sized\u00a0festival\" as Anna told me..which got me thinking of course! The barn itself belongs to land that also has on it a large area of the forest with the remains of an old\u00a0cloister from a\u00a0Johannite monk order, and\u00a0of course I was thus thinking the whole time about this as a perfect fit for the UnMonastery.\u00a0\n\nThere is a legal difficulty though, and this is one which could be to the advantage of the unMonastery's involvement. It seems that the land was sold by an old lawyer to a farmer and that the terms of the sale are in dispute. I cannot remember the exact details of this problem, but I do remember that it is almost scary how it fits the nature of the transition in general with the old lawyer using legal blocks to any productive work being done and the farmer unable to utlize the land properly or make the changes he needs to make to create a productive situation. At the time I remember thinking that this is the key that the Edgeryders can turn to make this situation work. Alas we will have to wait for Anna-Irene to remind us of the details.\n\nIn front of me I have a hand drawn map of the space and a key as to what goes where inside, but it is in my shabby writing and in pink and bue ink and so I will instead invite Anna to post some details about the site and suggestions for the road ahead below.\n\nFor now I can offer that there is space here for a lot of good work in a beautiful and friendly environment. Anna has suggested \u00a0that a good time for activities in this space woud be in season, that is July-August, and that she would like help in the ceation of a manifesto, a manual, and a manuscript for the values, guidelines and vision of this 'Playground for Peace'.\u00a0Do you have ideas, are you excited about helping this project get moving?\u00a0\n\nIf so contact: annairene@goodvibeify.com\n\n(:and remind her to join edgeryders when her fingers are free of the strings she plays so well:)\n\n", "created_at": "2013-03-30 07:29:06", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:43.039829", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 958, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13188, "user_id": 605, "topic_id": 1367, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Hey, \n\nactually I had this</b>\n\nHey,\u00a0\n\nactually I had this conversation yesterday with my Austrian roommate about how educational systems treat foreign languages. I am Greek and I went to a private french - greek school (as i have already mentioned) so for me it was obligatory to learn french, but in public schools the foreign language comes at the last classes of primary school (at the age of around 10). To tell the truth I don't have experience how intensive it is or if it really works but as far as I have seen, most of the Greeks in my age they speak one (english) foreign language pretty well and a second one in an intermediate level.\u00a0\n\nI think it helps also that movies and TV are not dubbed so it is easier at least to get used of the sound. Although our accent is faaaar from the British one.. and I really don't know why.. I keep asking my self why Scandinavians are most of them almost native English speakers and we are not.. and the only answer I can't find is that maybe we are not taught the correct way. During classes (depending of course on the teacher) we mostly talk in English or French but still Greek presence is there...\u00a0\n\nSome months ago I started an adult course of German. The experience was completely different. The teacher entered the class and she started talking ONLY in German, even when she needs to explain something she does it in German or in \"pantomime\" .. even if sometimes I get frustrated I think it really helps! I don't know if at the end it is just a matter of maturity and will (when we are children, we all felt a bit of parents pressure on studying languages) or it has to do with the system...\u00a0\n\nI would like to hear more as well from <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/users/adria-florea\" target=\"_blank\">Adria </a>who lives in Copenhagen.. maybe she could give us more insight about Scandinavian educational system :)\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-10 18:38:12", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:14.681937", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 364, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [9227], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2696, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 2663, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Guys Edgeryders is firmly committed to Open Source and the free sharing of information.

So one way of looking at this challenge, keeping in mind the media we're likely to use - with all that the medium implies, is to find a basic entry point to questioning something almost everyone takes for granted in everything they do - from going on a date or studying for a test or deciding to experiment by doing in order to make a difference or invest or satisfy voters or... that they don't have to think about what kind of future they are using to make these choices and what methods they are using to imagine the future.\u00a0 But, in fact, there are different kinds of future and different ways of imagining the future and different ways of using the future.\u00a0 How to get the illiterate to know that they are illiterate?\n\nWhat is going on - depends of POV, but basically I'd put it that we're being challenged to \"grow up\" and rediscover ways of thinking that aim to generate wisdom. Thinking in terms of this 'campaign' or effort to co-create a process for negotiating and experimenting with the creation of shared boundary objects - sense-making that empowers, it seems to me we need to test different articulations of the basic proposition in many different communities. But the tests need to real - meaning we need to find ways of walking-the-talk of empowerment and using the future differently.\u00a0 So, I think most of all we need to invite, encourage, undertake, join-in as many experiences of using the future in structured ways as possible.\u00a0 The structure is crucial for the \"learning\" and generation of shared sense-making.\n\nThat's it for now.

I worked on films in production for the past eight years, gradually mastering a job and then learning the next one up until I was producing. But the reason I pursued film was because I love storytelling. So I finally got the courage and the resources to write and direct a short film. A few months after submitting my film to various different film festivals, I noticed what a strong reaction I had when I got a rejection letter. And likewise, what a great feeling of exultation when I received a letter of acceptance.\n\nIt may seem like a very natural, predictable experience, but I was so taken by the power of some outside institution or group of strangers' opinions of my work, that I began looking into competition and how it played a role in my identity on a daily basis. How it shaped my relationships, my choices, my beliefs. Then I began seeing how it shaped so much of our world. From sports competition, to economic competition, to identities within even a family. So I left film behind, just for a few months, and poured myself into something I have never done, an art exhibit.\n\nIt was a collaborative art exhibit called, 'big winner' where all the pieces centered around the ideas of competition and winning in our culture. I sewed an American flag out of red, white and blue award ribbons. I invited other artists to contribute. I even painted large pieces that then the public came up and contributed to by drawing and coloring on them. I held the exhibit in a free, vacant storefront in a little trafficked mall. There wasn't a big crowd at the space that night, but one person came who I had never met before. And as soon as we started talking we were fast friends and she said she had been discouraged because no artists in the area seemed to want to collaborate on projects. She likened meeting me, in this empty storefront in a little trafficked mall at my exhibit, to running into an astronaut at Mcdonalds. What a compliment!\n\nI realized all the work I had done the past few months was me desperately trying to make sense of rejection and test the ground beneath my feet and see if I really was ok with 'failure'. If I really could be fearless. And it wasn't about the art at all, or even what I thought I had to 'say' but that something precious in the process had connected me to a collaborator.\n\nAround that time my mind began to open and I've begun searching google for words that represent what I want to bring into my life. So on this evening I am exploring 'we dream together ' and this search brought me to you and edgeryders. It's humbled me and made me more sensitive to the areas I invest my attention. I am interested in refining my skills and finding ways to collaborate on projects that create the world I long to live in. I thought I needed to move from the small town I have lived for the past six years because it lacked so many of the things that made me thrive when I lived in London, theatre, art, vibrancy. What I have realized this past year is that, it's my responsibility to create the community I crave. Such freedom and expansiveness in that realization.

I need to get back at\u00a0the organizers with a set of proposals in the coming month.</strong>\n\n---\n\nWe are com-ple-te-ly in line with their view on Social Care and how Health Hacking can change the game. The Health Hacking event is actually a\u00a0trademarked event that originated in Canada (I might meet with co-founder <span>\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucsirois\">Luc Sirois</a> on the occasion of a travel in Quebec in April). They have a Europe wide yearly edition that <a href=\"http://hackinghealth.ca/event/hacking-health-camp/\">usually takes place in Strasbourg</a>.\n\nI believe we have advantage of being part of this event in Bordeaux. I would encourage as many of you as possible to join. Here are a list of things we could do:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>The event starts with a one-day of talks. We can ask to have a 1/2 hour slot to talk about what/how/why we are doing. I am sure a combination of visions emerging from EdgeRyders/ScImpulse/WeMake/(Milano?) will be of interest to a majority of people attending the conference. (Did you know 50% of gross salles -- chiffre d'affaires in French -- in technology related health business is made in Aquitaine?).</li>\n\n<li>The event then welcomes a hackaton where teams work on project that are pitched in by sponsors (companies, organizations, name it). Each project is pitched in on Friday evening; teams form around projects and useful competencies; other people are there to coach teams\u00a0on tech, legal, medical or any other aspects during the whole duration of the hackaton.</li>\n\n<li>Project output are graded and prizes are offered to teams -- no money, but rather accompanying measures to help teams go forward with their ideas and prototypes.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>OpenCare could well pitch in a project on which team(s) would work. This could be an opportunity to recruit competencies we find necessary for a prototype we have in view.</li>\n\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nI feel this is a not-to-miss opportunity. I know the\u00a0EC funded OpenCare has a short, two years life to live, but OpenCare should make it so to last much longer. By discussing with the local organizers -- they happen to both be medical practitioners and tech passionates, I could\u00a0foresee potential future projects on a vast panel\u00a0of topics.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-03-24 14:39:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:21.721664", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 506, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2743, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 2710, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<span>Tired of the holes in the road?<span> Why don't you plant flowers in the potholes as some activisits did in <span>Kolomiya, Ukraine</span>?

Even as a master's student I felt that answering the question: <em>What do you do?</em> with the answer <em>I'm studying</em> is not good enough for some. Of course there's a set model which says that once you graduate, the normal thing to do is have a job. Even as a student you are in search of a job, preparing the field for later. That's why there is so much focus on practical internships and extra-curricular activities. Because just going to school is far from being a good enough answer even in your twenties. You have to have a plan, to say the least. A very common question nowadays in Romania, with the spread of mass university education, is: \u201cwhat do you come out to be out of university?\u201d\n\nI was studying social sciences - which has ambiguous correspondent in the labor market - so I was a little worried before graduating. Having to explain people what my job is was hard enough, but explaining how come I don't have a job or work for free in research grants, internships, NGOs, student associations is even harder.\u00a0\n\nI had it in my mind very clear that I have to invest in whatever I want to get and I knew that I wasn't a slacker. What I noticed was that my friends who had the most resources and came from wealthy families still haven't taken jobs or haven't invested in anything, not in themselves. And my other friends who are basically poor and couldn\u2019t afford to graduate from university were the ones who did get jobs and still work hard, even if it\u2019s temporary jobs and they could do much better if given the opportunity. So in the end it comes down to what <em>you</em> want to do, and how <em>you</em> make use of your resources: <strong>your allies are your resources</strong>.\n\nSo I had just graduated last July and I was having a beer with my dad. We were talking about me going away for an unpaid traineeship at the Council of Europe, having raised money to go and still needing his support to be able to make it. And when I told him that I am kinda scared about the reactions at this coming from relatives, friends of friends and society at large he said: \u201cYou have a lifetime of jobs ahead, still have plenty of time. You know what\u2019s best for you, do your thing and don\u2019t let others talk you out of it\u201d. And he mumbled something about life being interesting particularly now when traveling and experiencing stuff.\n\n<strong>So</strong> <strong>my parents are major allies for giving me all the freedom in the world to make my own choices, move around, travel back and forth.</strong> Both them and my life partner, for their moral stances and financial support as well, are my major allies. And they also become part of my goals: to make something I am proud of because I know in turn they will be proud. And my rewards to my parents so far have moved from being a good kid, having good grades, being mature about my entourage even when it was pulling me down, having scholarships, choosing well my partner in life to finally getting paid for my work and having a great first job \u2013 a so called consultant for the Council of Europe (it\u2019s basically being part of a team working for the Edgeryders project). At the same time, I am now sitting at a seminar and wearing a badge saying \u201cfreelancer\u201d, a term I wouldn\u2019t know if it\u2019s looked down upon or not. But it does imply some insecurity.\n\nWhich is what brings me to my next potential allies. More recently, <strong>I notice that professional networks matter greatly in terms of opportunities.</strong> My networks so far are mainly rooted in university, and I find that investment as a student had paid off. But I\u2019m curious about how to continue to nurture those relationships not being a student anymore and physically absent.\n\nWhat does it mean building networks? Do you build long term networks or rather it\u2019s a chain of reactions \u2013 if 1 person in your 5-members-network is reliable, he will put you in contact with other 5, and taking it from there would mean perpetuating your belonging to several mixed networks, but not so much reinforcing the older ones? What is the best strategy?\n\n", "created_at": "2011-12-19 12:16:35", "updated_at": "2017-08-30 11:01:03.119689", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 805, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12645, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1670, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Drag-and-drop</b>\n\nI don't know how related it is, but you dragged-and-dropped (or copypasted) your text into the edit window, so you got a lot of nasty &lt;style span&gt; code.

Je suis dipl\u00f4m\u00e9 en sociologie de l'Universit\u00e9 Laval en1983, p\u00e8re de 3 enfants, grand-p\u00e8re compl\u00e8tement gaga de 2 gar\u00e7ons de 2 et 1 an. Depuis les 25 derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, j'ai beaucoup r\u00e9fl\u00e9chi sur l'interaction de l'\u00c9tat avec les citoyens. Apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 entrepreneur, coop\u00e9rant en d\u00e9veloppement international, fonctionnaire, j'ai travaill\u00e9 pendant plusieurs ann\u00e9es pour un d\u00e9put\u00e9 puis dans des cabinets minist\u00e9riels. J'ai eu la chance de vivre des exp\u00e9riences professionnelles riches et diversifi\u00e9es qui ont renforci chez moi un sens de l'\u00c9tat appuy\u00e9 sur une connaissance assez fine des m\u00e9canismes gouvernementaux. Ce qui fait de moi quelqu'un qui peut comprendre les besoins des citoyens et les contraintes d'un syst\u00e8me public.\n\nJ'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9 dans une famille o\u00f9 la politique \u00e9tait l'objet de discussions et de pr\u00e9occupations de presque tous les instants. Je suis comme tomb\u00e9 dedans quand j'\u00e9tais petit, ce qui fait que lorsque je suis arriv\u00e9 dans les cabinets en 1996 \u00e0 35 ans, j'avais d\u00e9j\u00e0 un bon bagage et une bonne perspective sur l'engagement public. Mon passage en politique m'a fait perdre bien des id\u00e9aux, mais j'y ai rencontr\u00e9 des gens engag\u00e9s et passionn\u00e9s. La plupart des \u00e9lus que je connais le font pour les bonnes raisons, pour servir leurs pairs. Ils ne m\u00e9ritent pas d'\u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des escrocs, ce que beaucoup de g\u00e9rants d'estrade pensent d'eux.\n\nJe suis demeur\u00e9 \u00e0 travers le temps un passionn\u00e9 de l'\u00c9tat qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, et du service public en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Je suis tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par la perte de confiance des citoyens envers leurs repr\u00e9sentants. Pour avoir moi-m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent avec ma famille lors d'un coup d'\u00c9tat en Ha\u00efti en septembre 1990, je sais \u00e0 quel point on tient trop facilement pour acquise la d\u00e9mocratie et \u00e0 quel point elle est pr\u00e9cieuse. Deux semaines \u00e0 entendre tirer partout autour de sa maison, \u00e7a fait r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir son homme.\n\nComme je le mentionne dans ma biographie, je travaille dans le domaine des technologies depuis 2004. Ma grande r\u00e9flexion tourne autour de la mise \u00e0 profit plus efficace des technologies pour le service public. C'est pendant un mandat de conseil strat\u00e9gique aupr\u00e8s du Conseil du tr\u00e9sor que j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 sensibilis\u00e9 aux potentiels du gouvernement ouvert. Ce fut pour moi une v\u00e9ritable d\u00e9couverte. Je r\u00e9alise enfin que les outils disponibles aujourd'hui peuvent s'int\u00e9grer \u00e0 une d\u00e9marche d'\u00c9tat structur\u00e9e et\u00a0 porteuse pour redonner confiance aux citoyens. La transparence, la circulation de l'information publique peuvent redonner les moyens de rendre imputables les d\u00e9cideurs publics et tirer vers le haut la performance des organismes publics. Enfin une vision d'affaire rassembleuse qui peut permettre de r\u00e9pondre aux enjeux de restrictions budg\u00e9taires qui confrontent tous les \u00c9tats.\n\nAu cours des derniers mois, j'ai eu la chance de collaborer avec des conseillers de fort calibre, avec qui nous avons commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9laborer une offre de service d'accompagnement des organisations qui souhaitent se donner une strat\u00e9gie de gouvernement ouvert.

Il y a une \u00e9lection, et un nombre X de candidats, qui correspondent \u00e0 un nombre x de partis politiques. Ces infos sont collig\u00e9es sur Voxe. Il arrive souvent que les id\u00e9es v\u00e9hicul\u00e9es dans les programmes politiques ne correspondent pas vraiment aux aspirations des citoyens, parce que la plupart du temps, ces partis et leurs candidats, ne sont pas vraiment branch\u00e9s, connect\u00e9s sur les citoyens. D'apr\u00e8s cette hypoth\u00e8se, l'ensemble des id\u00e9es contenues dans les programmes \u00e9lectoraux, c'est-\u00e0-dire, les donn\u00e9es recueillies sur Voxe, ne fourniraient qu'une vision partielle des possibles, car elles n'incluent pas les aspirations r\u00e9elles d'une population.\n\nJ'entrevois votre projet, Voxe, comme ayant comme capacit\u00e9 - \u00e0 sa plus haute vision de lui-m\u00eame - de dresser un portrait de la partie existante des id\u00e9es, celles des candidats aux \u00e9lections. Appelons cela le p\u00f4le positif... en supposant que nous faisons r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au langage quantique.\n\nIl nous manquerait le p\u00f4le n\u00e9gatif, c'est-\u00e0-dire la partie des id\u00e9es et des aspirations d'une population.\n\nEt ensuite, on pourrait comparer les portraits des deux p\u00f4les, et voir si les deux se rejoignent.\n\nEt ensuite --- probablement que cela ne se rejoint que tr\u00e8s partiellement --- ensuite, on pourrait prendre cela et aller voir les gouvernements et leur dire: \"Regardez vers quoi aspire votre peuple. Ajustez vos politiques et vos projets pour que le tout s'aligne dans cette direction.\"\n\nNous pourrions comparer cela \u00e0 un iceberg. Voxe est la partie que l'on voit, et ce que l'on ne voit pas, qui est sous l'eau, ce sont les param\u00e8tres inconnus, les id\u00e9es et id\u00e9aux d'une population.\n\nOn pourrait comparer cela \u00e0 deux portraits imprim\u00e9s sur une pellicule transparente.

The general idea is to build a shared view of the problematic transition young Europeans face today by creating knowledge: by putting together resources and individual strategies so that we learn to deal with transition. All of this requires a huge collaborative effort and the availability of as many individuals as possible. Our focus is not on \"the young\" as a category, but on the transition to autonomy of people of every age. Yet, every other mature person who hears about Edgeryders and expresses her wish to form part of the community does so reluctantly. Why? Because she doubts over whether the age or status fit what apparently is an Edgeryder. \u00a0The answer to such concerns is as clear as daylight: <strong>YES we need you!</strong> Enormous contributions can be brought by people who have already gone through transitions, or find themselves still in the process, or simply have something to say about it. For the most restless of us, transitioning is never really going to be over. Furthermore, interactions on the platform are not at all reduced to people seeking support; the whole point of peer-to-peer is that you receive and give support in the same space. This entails sharing pivotal moments from your life and\u00a0the lessons you've learned, in this way helping somebody who feels similarly challenged. With this in mind, let's take the time to reflect a little bit on: How do we want to know each other? Here\u2019s a set of values which in my mind our community should adhere to. Not only do these values govern peer-to-peer interactions, but they also stand at the core of how we communicate with other stakeholders \u2013 institutions, policy experts, social innovators, the media etc.\u00a0 The list below is by no means closed, so feel free to suggest others you think can lead to valuable interactions and output.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Honesty =&gt; Authenticity</strong>. We are operating under the assumption that any first-hand, granular information is unique and brings a meaningful contribution to the overall puzzle. The only way to be able to find adequate support for your transition issues is to speak openly about it.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Trust =&gt; Reciprocity.</strong> As human beings, we rely on trust when building relationships. When sharing information that is so important in our private lives, we need to do it with the feeling that it is received as such; even more so when the channel we use is different from everyday face-to-face communication. One wonders who the audience in the back of our computer screens is, but with Edgeryders connections are bilateral. Commitment to our story and to others\u2019 is valid only if we believe the exchange is reciprocal, and thus worth our time and energy.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Respect</strong>. What started out this project is the idea that young people themselves have to build the narrative of their generation. Instead of going for a top-down approach in which some government or policy maker points the finger at what's wrong and what should be done about it, we leave it to those in question to feel empowered and speak about what exactly they are facing.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Initiative</strong>. It is very much appreciated and all that may come with it \u2013creativity, boldness, originality. What we are building is based on all of these ingredients which are here to remind us of how our generation looks like and what it can pass on to future ones.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Transparency: </strong>Edgeryders uses <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software\" target=\"_blank\">open-source software</a>, making it possible for anybody to access related information. Once our platform is up and going, a lot of rich data will be packed, saved and eventually left as a gift and reference to future projects. And lastly, just as my friend Nadia would say, the idea is to have fun while doing all this work, because otherwise it is not worth it. I'll leave you in the company of my favourite satirist Bill Hicks, who tells us that life is \"just a ride\" and that we should make our own choices! Does it sound familiar?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/7criyE09uy0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2011-10-02 07:48:46", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:13:59.920930", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 754, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23290, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5596, "post_number": 14, "raw": "<b>Inconsistency</b>\n\nHm.

The events of 2014 resulted in a change of government, with new policies being ushered through; a newfound energy and confidence in civil society, especially young people; and a generally very positive outlook on the role of youth by society at large.\n\nThe post-Maidan Ministry of Youth and Sports claims to be \"very open\", and is recognised as such. It is making a real effort to include and ingratiate the civil society. A new law on volunteering was introduced, which improved significantly the legal landscape: setting up NGOs has been made easy; non-affiliated volunteers have been recognised as having the same legal status as those affiliated to NGOs; the requirement of insurance for volunteers has been scrapped. Significant difficulties remain at the operational level, as the law has not been translated into lower-level regulation and policy. Bureaucratic hurdles, especially surrounding financial matters, remain significant for youth NGOs; this is partly due to the generally very conservative and risk-averse attitude of the lower echelons of the civil service. Like other international organisations (for example the European Union) the U.N. maintains an excellent partnership relationship with the ministry.\n\nThe mid-term (2016-2020) objectives for the Ministry are encoded in a document called the State Programme. The SP's priorities are:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>housing</li>\n\n<li>lifestyle</li>\n\n<li>employment (also via recognition of non-formal education)</li>\n\n<li>national patriotic education</li>\n\n<li>support to young IDP</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nYouth unemployment in Ukraine is possibly the lowest of the six countries under consideration (17.8% in 2013 according to the World Bank). It does not tend to be mentioned as a national emergency when talking to public officials.\n\nOn a longer-term perspective, the Ministry is working to adapt its policies to European Union standards, and to set up a national network of youth centres. There is an interest for social innovation and entrepreneurship, but so far more as a aspiration. Volunteerism and intercultural dialogue are intended also as instruments to reinforce national unity; in Ukraine, the word \"volunteer\" is (not uniquely) associated to voluntary militias who take up weapons to join the conflict in the East.\n\nPreliminary interest in our program has been expressed by ministry staff and advisors, as well as staff of the presidential administration.\n\nWe also met the EU delegation in Ukraine. An experienced officer told us that the EU's strategy to establish a \"safe belt\" surrounding the Union is perceived to have failed. The Eastern Partnership policy is currently being formally revised; an input gathering phase is already finished, and that input is now being processed. Realistically, the revision will be concluded in 2016.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">News from the grassroots \u00a0</h3>\n\nUkraine has a very active civil society. Its scope ranges from environmental protection by cleaning up littered sites (Let's Do It Ukraine, part of a global movement, that drives hundreds of thousands of participants, and has significant private sector partnerships), lifestyle and sport (X-Park), promotion of cycling (Kiev Cycling association), open data and civic tech (SocialBoost, at the centre of a very large network of 1000 software developers) and energy efficiency (Energy Country), as well as more traditional and structured youth NGOs like the scouts (Plast), Chamber of Commerce-type philanthropy (Enactus, ISEC),\u00a0 NGOs targeting social issues like the integration of institutionalised orphans, or people with disabilities, into the fabric of society, and the students self-government bodies. Many NGOs aim to ameliorate the uniquely Ukrainian issue of internally displaced people (IDPs); these are Ukrainians from the Donetsk region that relocated west to escape the conflict. Finally, grassroots initiatives are present not only in Kiev, but all across the country, especially in the regional centers.\n\nThe NGO/youth activism landscape has some unique characteristics.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Many NGO leaders are unpaid. They devote to their NGOs their spare time, but have day jobs \u2013 often commercial businesses in event organising, logistic, marketing and communications.</li>\n\n<li>This, however, creates a tension between the need for staying independent and that to have paid people to deliver better results. As a consequence, an initiative called School of Social Projects has emerged to train activists in fundraising and organising. A similar need in the cultural sphere resulted in a School of cultural activists.</li>\n\n<li>EuroMaidan had an enormous influence. Everybody we met had participated personally, often with very active of leadership roles; it taught Ukrainian youth how effective at delivery smart, connected crowds can be even in the absence of formal organisations. The most life-changing experiences were perhaps not so much the protest itself, but the almost instant provision of services to keep the protest going; security to defend the activists, improvised nano-hospitals in tents to treat the injured or ailing (there was even a reanimation tent), logistics and information (call centres, websites etc.) to keep the movement supplied with people, food, water, warm clothes and medicines. Opportunistic episodes (with people claiming to be \"working for Maidan\" draining the common pool of resources) were very effectively prevented by an impromptu system of identity verification based on a phone hotline. Additionally, Maidan gave to activists a shared experience and a sense of fraternity to support future common initiatives.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThe city of Kiev is attempting to redevelop and renovate its Trade Fair Center. This is a very large area (about 200 hectares), connected with the Kiev metro. At the moment the structure is unfit for purpose and needs significant investment. We met a member of the newly appointed management team, who said they would consider a partnership for programme activities to unfold within this area.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-26 10:35:07", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:26.858921", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1085, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 40.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14470, "user_id": 2569, "topic_id": 5729, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Definitely</b>\n\nYes, an application would make more sense.

I grew up in a small town, so when I moved to cities as a young man I could immediately feel the challenge. The politics of encouraging people to own their homes rather than rent pushed young people into competing in an ever-narrowing market: in Italy there is perhaps one apartment for rent each ten for sale. In London I lived in university accomodation, that was all I could afford.\n\nMy last-but-one city of residence was Milano. There I was able to find a satisfactory solution (though by no means cheap) by moving onto a hipster neighborhood, Dergano-Maciachini). Lots of old small industrial buildings, or even older apartment blocks that would host one-or two men companies making mattrasses or tailoring clothes. I lived in a loft scavenged from the premises of a small company that put meat into cans. Outside, the area was (still is) immigration intensive and a bit rough. Immigrants from Egypt, China, Romania, Peru and many other countries live side by side with an earlier wave of Southern Italian immigrants, who arrived in the 1960s and 1970s, and with the indigenous Milanese families. Me and my crowd were the most recent waves: professionals, students, more or less precarious, moving in attracted by the relatively cheap spaces, good public transport network and proximity to the center. It worked for me - but not for everyone. A disconforting number of people in the area support the xenophobic Lega Nord party.\n\nAs I consider my next move, I am investigating hipster neighborhoods. I don't think it makes sense to even try to live anywhere else. There is a sense of community: the cafes are cheap and open late; there is at least some cultural diversity; space is still relatively cheap. Still, I wonder if we are building ghettos for the precariat; or if people like me are going to drive the prices up and the original communities out as the neighborhood gentrifies. Until we ourselves are driven out by the next wave of gentrification.\n\n", "created_at": "2011-12-07 14:49:06", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:31.221471", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 389, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27629, "user_id": 1438, "topic_id": 2051, "post_number": 25, "raw": "<b>schedule</b>\n\n[Noemi]you're right but we need to display a programm! how can we fix it?

This sustainability schema is not producing rent, but it is returning back the resources initially contributed by crowd-funding and volunteering. If the sustainability schema is producing a surplus, part to the surplus is used to improve the service itself and the other part returns to the society through social projects.\n\nAn eCoService does not have owners in the traditional sense of the word, but an eCoService defines the ownership with base in the 'voting power', i.e. the right to participate in decision-making process that involves the operation of the eCoService. This ownership is achieved in two ways, either by providing the initial resources to create the eCoService ('founding peer'), or becoming an eCoService 's user ('collaborative peer'). An eCoService guarantees in the long run the equality of that ownership, i.e. if we compare two people where one begins providing some of the initial resources to create the eCoService, and the other begins some time later as a user; it can be seen that initially the 'voting power' is determined by the degree of contribution and involvement with the eCoService, but as time goes on, the 'voting power' of this two people begin to be similar until both are equal, and that is true for all.\n\nThe eCoService 's users are also receiving an acknowledgment of the experience gained by using the service provided by the eCoService through what is called 'expertise power'. As an example, if the eCoService is Facebook, then each time an user is uploading a photo, the user is accumulating 'expertise power'. This is because as a person is using the eCoService and is gaining experience in it, this user is adding value to the eCoService. A service without its users and without its users 's networking mechanisms would have absolutely no value. This 'expertise power' could be used later with different purposes in the eCoService 's operation.\n\nFinally an eCoService is a model (a tool) to explore and develop new forms of governance and resource management, and ultimately to look for better social structures, those that allow the development of healthy relationships with ourselves and with others. You can see an eCoService as a <a href=\"http://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Seed-Bomb\">Seed Bomb</a>, you throw it at a certain space in society with the hope of improving this space.\n\n<b>Bottom-up social hacking process through eCoServices</b>\n\nAs is explained better <a href=\"http://jcouchet.wordpress.com/2012/07/04/bottom-up-social-hacking-process-through-ecoservices/\">here</a> , the idea is to use the eCoServices in a bottom-up process that pretends to make a shift in the way that society behaves regard social and ecological sustainability. With other words, what is intended here is to start a process that is creating more and more eCoServices, each one offering different services and being complementary between them. So that these eCoServices are creating in the society an space for alternative relationships schemes (alternative social structures), and this space is getting bigger and bigger until it becomes the society itself.\n\n<b>Every story has a beginning</b>\n\nThe stated previously is the abstract idea, but to make change happening, we are needing ideas plus action, i.e. we are needing to take the very first step to create the first eCoService, and then experiment with it and see how far we can go with this idea.\n\n<u>So, what is needed to create this first eCoService</u>?\n\nBasically three things:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>(1) To define the service to be provided by the eCoService</li>\n\n<li>(2) To define the type of legal entity that will adopt the eCoService (the general template)</li>\n\n<li>(3) The resources to implement the eCoService</li>\n\n</ul><b>(1)</b> <i>To define the service to be provided by the eCoService</i>:\n\nThe service to be provided is the Goal2us idea:\n\nDevelop a community where each one is empowered to reach their goals through <strong>peer-to-peer support </strong>(mutual companion). For this reason the community is called Goal2us, cause it is a community in which to achieve personal goals is within reach of all its members because each one is at the same time giving and receiving support.\n\nThen Goal2us is a community where we are not alone anymore on the path to achieve our personal goals, but we have a peer who gives us her/his company (support) along the path while we give her/him our company through <strong>daily small interactions in a virtual space</strong>. And we also have the support of the entire community of Goal2us, with which we can <strong>meet on a regular basis in</strong> <strong>special physical</strong> spaces to strengthen the relationships through conversations that matter.\n\nTo achieve the objective stated above, Goal2us is configured as a new kind of social network that interconnects the physical and virtual spaces through the following components:\n\n<ul><li><b>(i) </b>A web application with the aim of providing <strong>support to the people in order to reach small personal goals</strong> that can be achieved in a period of <strong>one to three months (short goals)</strong>. This support is provided facilitating the access to a peer in a similar situation of wanting to reach a goal, and using specific tools in order to help people define their goals, design a plan to achieve them and finally executing the plan with the companion of this peer from of the Goal2us community:</li></ul><ul><li>Thus, it is used the capacity of technology to overcome barriers of time and distance in order to be able to develop a companion relationship with the peer through daily small interactions guided by the tools provided by the web application</li></ul><ul><li>The <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/sites/edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/files/goal2us-small_daily_interactions.png\">image</a> is showing the interface of the web application that is facilitating the small daily interactions between both peers</li></ul><ul><li><b>(ii)</b> A network of physical collaboratives spaces with the aim of bringing people together to <strong>strengthen the relationships developed through the small daily interactions</strong> in the web application by means of <strong>real conversations</strong> about things that really matters:</li></ul><ul><li>In those <strong>conversations happening in a physical spac</strong>e, the people from the Goal2us community is talking about their experiences, encouraging others, sharing their problems and even <strong>working face to face</strong> on their goals</li></ul>Following the <a href=\"http://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Seed-Bomb\">Seed Bomb</a> metaphor, what Goal2us is looking for is to develop a space where trust can flourish at the personal and interpersonal level, by creating the conditions so that flowering occurs precisely because the people is using the space itself. Using that space under the right conditions makes people to germinate, cause in using the space the people is giving peer-to-peer support to others - thus creating trust at the interpersonal level-, at the same time that is also receiving support to realize a personal change - thus creating trust at the personal level. But Goal2us not only builds trust through the development of healthy relationships, it is also exploring new ways of governance and economics which also are shaping these relationships. And thus finally, Goal2us works as a new model that is demonstrating the obsolescence of the current models and providing a new alternatives from which people could observe, test, learn and and finally adopt.\n\n<b>(2)</b> <i>To define the type of legal entity that will adopt the eCoService</i>:\n\nHere first is needed more brainstorming in order to define the desired characteristics of an eCoService (ownership by 'voting power', no rent and so on), and then to define the legal structure to achieve these characteristics.\n\n<b>(3)</b> <i>The resources to implement the eCoService</i>:\n\nThe needed resources are the following:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Service technological implementation:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>A graphical designer</li>\n\n<li>A programmer</li>\n\n<li>Hosting at the cloud for six months</li>\n\n</ul></li>\n\n<li>Physical spaces:\n\n<ul><li>A physical space manager</li></ul></li>\n\n<li>Legal entity:\n\n<ul><li>A lawyer</li></ul></li>\n\n<li>Dissemination:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>A community manager</li>\n\n<li>A viral audiovisual (to use in YouTube)</li>\n\n</ul></li>\n\n</ul>\u00a0\n\nThe next post, titled \u201c<strong>Plan for the first eCoService launching</strong>\u201d .. it will have a draft for the plan to launch Goal2us as an eCoService.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-07-06 10:10:28", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:48.766101", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1913, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2383, "user_id": 9, "topic_id": 2350, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c23153d6f3555a2d857c2825ef65ec725a2c6b60.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"413\"><br>\n\nI arrived late last night and sadly depart early tomorrow morning - but today I spent\u00a0in Matera.\u00a0\n\nDespite the short visit, I have many reflections to share, the penny is dropping and unMonastery is very real, I will though restrict this post to giving an overview and suggestions on our next steps. I was greeted this morning at the site of unMonastery by MIMERS ([antonioelettrico]), [Rita O] and Paolo Verri. My primary purpose for being in Matera was to gain an overview of the renovation work that has been taking place on the building.\u00a0\n\n<strong>Good news</strong>, everything appears to be in good order thanks to the hard work of MIMERS,\u00a0[Rita O] and MT2019. Many fixes, rubbish\u00a0cleared and alterations have been made to ensure the building is in a usuable state when we arrive - the space has been structured in a such a way that we can have a kitchen on the ground or top floor, or both. Internet network ports have been distributed throughout the building and a plentiful number of showers installed throughout the top floor.\u00a0\n\nAfter viewing the building, we headed to MIMERS office to talk through the furniture and considered use of the space. MIMERS have been doing great work, what we have is minimal, as requested.

Following this, we discussed the appliances we would need, washer, dryer and electric kitchen appliances.\u00a0\n\nDuring lunch Rita highlighted that sourcing food from local producers will be relatively easy, given that there are several farmers markets in town on a weekly basis, so this should make your life easier [elf Pavlik] ^__~\u00a0\n\nNext myself and Rita met with Emmanuele Curti, archeologist and\u00a0professor at the University of Basilicata, to discuss the University but more specifically their potential\u00a0participation in the unMonastery project - given the subjects covered and the perspective I gleaned from our short conversation it's clear Emmanuele could be a great allie and potential contributor to\u00a0the project. We discussed the possibility of sharing the bottom floor (the main workspace) with students and other locals groups - this seems like an exceptionally good idea, since it brings people to us but this is of course open for discussion.\u00a0\n\nThis was followed by a meeting at the MT2019 building opposite the unMonastery, to discuss some finer details around the administrative process with Rossella and Claudia but also potential dates for announcing and celebrating the opening of the building - provisionally we are thinking about the 14th for a Press Conference and 16th for an open day and party. I trust though that [Bembo Davies] has already put much thought to this subject matter.\u00a0\n\nSome small next steps;\u00a0\n\n-Form small focused work groups\u00a0\n\n-Compile a list of possible connections and groups we'd\u00a0ideally like to speak with and/or listen to upon landing in Matera\n\n-Make a list of the things we don't have or would like/need and figure out how to acquire them before we arrive\u00a0(off the top of my head; Projectors, LCD screens, Tensile Rope, Tools, LED lighting, Electricity Monitor)\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThat's it for now, more updates and questions\u00a0will follow in the coming week but for now it's been a long day and my bed is making reasonable demands of me.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-01-18 23:45:57", "updated_at": "2018-06-03 01:51:37.414028", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 708, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1423], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1682, "user_id": 42, "topic_id": 1649, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<b id=\"internal-source-marker_0.4806224456988275\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; font-weight: normal; \"><span>Premise</span>\n\n<span>The Edgeryders community has demonstrated to be made up by inquisitive, active people that do not fear to set up and carry on initiatives to take current social problems head on. As the project was defined as a think tank for policy proposals to the EU, it came naturally that the attendees to the conference were provided with the space to develop proposals and projects in the areas Edgeryders deals with. The conference itself hosted 6 such workshops, one for each Edgeryders subject, while at the same time other 18 venues all around the world set up their own discussion groups around those same subjects under the \\#kfe06 initivative by Kf\u00e9 Innovaci\u00f3n.</span>\n\n<span>The sessions</span>\n\n<span>Making a living</span>\n\n<span>Making a living was structured along five elements:</span>\n\n<span>Paid work: This table tackled the complicated issue of finding paid work in today\u2019s labour market. One of the first things that came along was the dilemma between working for oneself or integrating into a company. To this it was answered that everyone is his/her own resource, and thus can barter skills with others, in order to create a common product that then can get in the market. Community-based projects and freelance life combine magnificently in this format of finding our own careers.</span>\n\n<span>There was also the issue of motivation for work: should it be based on personal satisfaction or on sustenance? Well, there\u2019s a conundrum, as personal satisfaction is all fine and good but rarely leads to a proper survival position, unless one is capable enough to make a viable career out of hobbies and interests.</span>\n\n<span>Social innovation: The table dealt with the strictures society imposes on individuals and ways to alleviate them. The lack of time for everything (family/friends, work, and our own projects) was of course an issue, as has been in several reports in the platform. The proposal to be all entrepreneurs, both in our personal projects and in the potential company we work in, is an interesting idea. But it depends on finding a company where personal initiative is valued and on having the skills necessary to drive change, a capacity not everyone has.</span>\n\n<span>Recruitment: The recruitment group started by considering the resum\u00e9/application process as broken (an affirmation most people who have been in a recruitment process will probably agree with). The frustration involved in sending hundreds of resum\u00e9s and never getting an answer is a common problem for most those looking for work, and those without work experience are almost always kept out of the market, thus being unable to ever obtain experience in the first place.</span>\n\n<span>Also, people without university degrees have a harder time to enter this process, as it\u2019s often the case they lack the know-how on resum\u00e9 writing and accessing the application processes. How to support them?</span>\n\n<span>Allies: The allies table considered the possibility of using networks of people with common interests to create diverse and multidisciplinary teams to develop projects together. Coworking spaces, as an example, are an excellent way of contacting people out of your field of experience and receiving useful input for projects, or ideas to create new ones. Productivity was considered more of a problem than a solution: the term \u201cproductivity stress disorder\u201d was used and seems like a good diagnosis of the current job environment.</span>\n\n<span>?: This table posed questions, several of them quite to the point. A mapping of the skills was considered, as current skill sets are way too diversified to get in traditional models. Hobbies, as well, should be included to avoid the extreme focus on education currently in force.</span>\n\n<span>Passion and curiosity were considered as a way to actually land a job, and one at that in something that is of interest to us, hopefully.</span>\n\n<span>We, the people</span>\n\n<span>This session was really massive. The amount of proposals and ideas that came out of it is staggering, and since it was one of the most populated sessions, many of them are actually in conflict. From criticisms to representative democracy (either due to lack of direct participation, i.e., the delegation of power to people and ideas instead of real needs), to reforms of the democratic system currently in place, up to a defense of the elimination of the state (due to the inherent inhumanity of power), several perspectives on the governing system were present. </span>\n\n<span>The proposal for tools to enact political change was also a very important part of the session, involving mobile phone voting systems, DDoS attacks as a valid form of protest, bridging the digital divide as an imperative condition, tools to develop Open Government initiatives...</span>\n\n<span>In fact, this session was so massive that it has luckily been documented </span><a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/we-people-session/mission_case/session-results\"><span>here</span></a><span> almost in full.</span>\n\n<span>Caring for commons</span>\n\n<span>The commons session spent half its time trying to define what commons are, with a humongous diversity of possible definitions. Afterwards, four groups were created around four themes or challenges: the reuse of empty spaces for the common good (with an action proposal based on city taxation to penalize keeping empty spaces), management of commons in an unequal society, that is, ours (which actually came up with the neat idea of making commons non economic factors, thus allowing everyone equal access to them)</span><span>, creation of commons (which proposal delineated a network aggregations software to generate communities of interest that, in turn, would be able to interact with the policy makers), and the protection of commons (heavily based on the Rio+20 conference, this group dealt with natural resources and their protection, and proposed, among other initiatives, the creation of a Global Council on Planetary Rights to protect what, ultimately, is and must be of all living beings).</span>\n\n<span>The session saw loads of knowledge generated, and several proposals on the table. Let us hope these proposals receive better results than the tepid ones the Rio+20 conference got.</span>\n\n<span>Living together</span>\n\n<span>The living together session dealt with a delicate issue: the reform and betterment of the social contract that has been the glue of our societies. For that, it focused on what has changed in the equation, and structured the changes in trust, bottom-up and balance. On the trust front, currently there exists a generalized lack of trust in others, and even oneself. A proposal to rebuild trust in oneself to be able to expand said trust is a beautiful idea, but practically impossible to generalize to the whole of society.</span>\n\n<span>Again, the bottom-up proposal to change society is basically correct, as it will mean that society will change itself. The viral method to spread change, however, again comes from the idea of personal change first, and would need several, probably thousands, of people enacting change at the same time.</span>\n\n<span>The loss of balance, due to the socio-economic environment and to a certain level of dysfunction in society, should also be restored, but again the proposal to restore balance is based on the personal level. Also, the point of balance was left undefined, which makes it complicated to create a viable paradigm or blueprint of change. </span>\n\n<span>Learning</span>\n\n<span>The session on learning started by differentiating learning from education and providing a characterization of each (learning is bottom-up while education is top-down). Afterwards, three groups were created to deal with different challenges and propose specific solutions for them. </span>\n\n<span>Group A dealt with the empowerment of teachers so they could develop their practice. The proposed teacher-centered curricula instead of the national curriculum (or alongside it), and identifying teachers\u2019 needs and recommended changes by the simple system of asking the teachers themselves. A proposal of equally divided budgets to implement learning projects developed by teachers was presented.</span>\n\n<span>Group B was tasked with developing a new mechanism to evaluate education without harming access to the labour market. For that, classical job profiling must be changed to anticipate the future needs of industry and employers (though how that can be done is a mistery). The proposal involved the elimination of marks and grades along with competition. Instead, a system should be developed to provide a less limited feedback and that reflected individual competences in a better way than the current one.</span>\n\n<span>Group C dedicated itself to the access to resources and expertise. To that end were proposed remote learning platforms, which are eminently accessible, and the sharing of educational resources in a free and open way. This way, the centralisation of education in physical institutions that creates discrepancies in current educational systems would be negated.</span>\n\n<span>All solutions proposed had to be applicable without regard for cultural differences, which is probably the reason why proposals tended to be generic in nature.</span>\n\n<span>Resilience</span>\n\n<span>The resilience session was tasked with creating ways of making a system survive sudden shocks or prolonged pressure, a problem everyone is probably worried about in the current climate in Europe. </span>\n\n<span>To that end, and given the limited time available, the session focused on a specific crisis scenario: the reduction of health resources to a mere 25%, and options to provide assistance in that situation. </span>\n\n<span>For that, the session developed three areas of health systems:</span>\n\n<span>- Prevention: avoiding sickness and injury can be accomplished by making individual health resilience (adequate diet, exercise...) fashionable. Of course, to accomplish this, aside from actually convincing people to act in a healthy way, the systems needed to provide a healthy life to citizens should be also adequately resilient.</span></b>\n\n<b id=\"internal-source-marker_0.4806224456988275\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; font-weight: normal; \"><span>- Treatment: to provide assistance, the group focused on the creation and strengthening of networks. Neighbourhood groups of mutual care, a health care experts network for specific, practical advice, and pharmaceutical networks to produce locally as many drugs as possible based on the WHO list of basic medications.</span></b>\n\n<b id=\"internal-source-marker_0.4806224456988275\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; font-weight: normal; \"><span>- Continuity: continuity implies the preparation of the health system for a sustained time. That is, the new activities applied to create a resilient health system must be kept working as permanently as possible. The proposed methods included training in diagnosis with scarcity of equipment, the use of generic drugs, the proper training on first aid as part of the driving license process (although it would not be a bad idea to include it directly in general education curricula probably), the teaching of keeping in good health from school, and identifying simple problems early to avoid larger ones that may emerge from them, among others.</span></b>\n\n<b id=\"internal-source-marker_0.4806224456988275\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; font-weight: normal; \"><span>What remains to be seen is if these methods will be implemented in time. The deconstruction of the welfare state is well underway in most of Europe, and countries like Greece needs resilient systems already implemented.</span></b>\n\n<b id=\"internal-source-marker_0.4806224456988275\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; font-weight: normal; \"><span>Conclusion</span>\n\n<span>In general, the breakout sessions demonstrated what was already likely: the Edgeryders community not only has ideas, but working capacity and is capable of proposing solid solutions to several problems currently in the minds of most Europeans. </span>\n\n<span>If these are the people writing the future (and already living there for the most part) we\u2019re in good hands.</span></b>\n\n<b style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; font-weight: normal; \"><span>But this is not the end of it.

This one is more about sharing insights from the NESTA guys with whoever is interested in social prototyping, general food for thought so whoever can hook on it and enrich it with personal experience.\n\nNevertheless, all this talk has had an impact on the ongoing brainstorming on the way to \"watch barter happen in the wild\". Do you think we're giving it too much thought and the Economy App should just be unleashed into the wild with no minimal design?\n\nI've been doing a little research on social prototyping: I'm not a fan of models, but I guess it's important (at least for me) to read a bit of stuff on other case studies, although I know that in the end each story is different and there is no already made recipe against complications - actually, this is what social prototyping is all about : the capacity to adapt to complications by integrating reality into its own service design.\n\nSo here's a bit of further thought... considering the different <a href=\"http://www.socialinnovator.info/process-social-innovation/prototyping-and-pilots/prototypes-pilots-and-trials\">paths </a>that social prototyping can take, I have a gut feeling that a some <a href=\"http://www.socialinnovator.info/process-social-innovation/prototyping-and-pilots/prototypes-pilots-and-trials/proof-concept-testing\">proof of concept testing</a> wouldn't harm the Economy App before delivering the service <em>de facto</em>. I don't know if this is what you meant by feeding on some \"empirical data\" but if this reality check is going to be done in Matera, then \"asking members of the target audience to assess, rate and/or refine the product concept\" means that target audience has to be addressed. Question is, which is the target audience? On this, I wouldn't think about it too much and would preferably use social media to push the question out into the wild. Basically, ask bluntly \"how could this work in Matera\"?\n\nThere is already the portal for subscription to the <a href=\"http://www.socialinnovator.info/process-social-innovation/prototyping-and-pilots/prototypes-pilots-and-trials/beta-testing\">beta testing</a> of the Economy App. Today there are 35 subscriptions: this should happen before the \"real-world test\" (say, in October-November?) and be a first step towards creating the momentum for January? Does that work?\n\nFinally, for the real-world test, I think that the <a href=\"http://www.socialinnovator.info/process-social-innovation/prototyping-and-pilots/prototypes-pilots-and-trials/whole-system-demonstration-pilots\">Whole System Demonstration Pilot</a> fits as what is trying to be tested here is the relationship between the barterers and how this network dimension builds into grouped exchange. Before getting there I would try to get some feedback from local community, starting from a post in the mt2019 community which explains the idea and expresses the desire to come and test it out in Matera, asking people: would this work? if so, how?\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n", "created_at": "2013-07-25 21:23:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:18.634326", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 545, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25140, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 2416, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Short UPDATES</b>\n\nI have sent the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/?tab=mo&amp;authuser=0#folders/0B_vWawrKpTaFZmtJOThoVXBTREtPQnBiR1RaVFhoZw\">timeline </a>OK-ed also by Matthias, but because of the contract signing delay we also ended up with a slighly different calendar.

Around the world there are people exploring the edge of our current society. They aspire to solve global societal, economic, environmental, security and energy problems threatening humanity. They care about several different issues, such as open access to knowledge; openness and transparency of government; food security; smart communities; decentralized economic architecture; free/open source software; and art.</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>Amazing projects demonstrate hope for the future and visions of the world which is possible when we work together. In Cairo, residents brought along tools, bulldozers and just started building their wikicity. In Italy a group of young activists are improving their cities by engaging inhabitants to reactivate abandoned buildings. In Tbilisi a group of young activists engaged women in mastering technology in the quest to improve their communities. Many people living their dreams together are changing their corner of the world, one small initiative at a time.</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>Video Concept</span></span>\n\n<span><span>This video aims to inspire its viewers. It will show them where and how people are already building the future. People working on the edge will give the viewers their ideas on how they see the future. It will attempt to answer the following questions:</span></span>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>How can we anticipate what is coming and if we have some idea, how do we react accordingly? </span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>We are all individuals with our own perceptions. We can do research, we can create a policy based on future predictions, but how often do these futures we predict come true? </span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>How can we create something for a future environment, when we are not sure what it will look like? </span></span>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<span><span>Some out there are not afraid to take a risk, to pursue to change the communities around them facilitating for a better future.</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>Video Format</span></span>\n\n<span><span>This video is about collective sensemaking: The future is not a numbers game. Individuals with different visions make up different futures. Trends are starting to permeate groups and communities. How can we harness the knowledge, make sense and prototype at scale? </span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>Using Google Hangout, people from interesting projects are asked to share their stories, these will be mashed up and edited - as if they are small conversations. Both original and existing footage will be used. The video will show all the different futures being built as we speak. While talking about these particular futures, their ideas will be illustrated with 2D graphics. At the end they will swarm together, showing all these different futures.</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>We will ask the following questions to a group of people working outside of the mainstream: Recently, were you involved in something you felt makes a contribution to you, your peers/ community? Why did you start your project? Have you encountered any struggles/obstacles/threats? How do you see the future if everyone on the planet would be empowered by projects like yours? How have you positioned yourself in a changing world? How have you adapted to changes in the world? What accomplishment are you most proud of, and why? How long is your planning horizon? How would it affect how your project if you had a 200 year perspective?</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:-8.1pt;\">\n\n<table

I'll just want to implement it in a generic way so that we can re-use the solution for any data syncing purposes lateron, not requiring changes to .htaccess every single time. I looked around for Drupal modules, and it seems that a REST API that exposes your views is the only meaningful way to get this done (<a href=\"https://drupal.org/project/services\">services</a> + <a href=\"https://drupal.org/project/services_views\">services_views</a> + <a href=\"https://drupal.org/project/services_basic_auth\">services_basic_auth</a>).\n\nI'll care to get this configured today. Sorry for the delay ... I was configuring something similar with <a href=\"https://drupal.org/project/securesite\">securesite</a>, until I discovered that it would add a HTTP Basic Auth option to every single page on this website (and the <a href=\"https://drupal.org/node/92816\">option to restrict this to just some pages</a> was only implemented for Drupal 5).\n\nRe. who is considered part of the team: in our current setup, having an added role says nothing anymore about team status. We even have well-regarded admins like <a href=\"/u/auli\">@Auli</a> who have not been on an Edgeryders payroll yet. So it seems cleanest to me to just drop detecting team membership from roles completely and let your script read a simple config file that will list team members by UID (and if you want, adding multiple date ranges where the user was part of the team). I guess it does not make sense to keep that information on the platform (since team status only relates to one project such as Spot the Future, which officially is just one of many projects with equal rights on this site; plus, <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">legacy_id</code> is up for deletion). So it will be the cleanest solution to maintain this config file with UIDs. For getting the UIDs, <a href=\"/u/alberto\">@Alberto</a> is the right person for the job \u2013 I just don't know everyone to include.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-06-01 00:11:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:44.396774", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 376, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [29867], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6371, "user_id": 3362, "topic_id": 6338, "post_number": 1, "raw": "In April I received the happy news that I was selected as an OpenCare\u00a0Community Fellow by SCimPULSE Foundation and Edgeryders.\n\nIronically, in the month that marked the start of the fellowship, I was struck by several illnesses. As a Belgian citizen, I can get the best care for next to zero financial cost for myself. Though, what is mainly just a nuisance for me, can be dramatic for those in more precarious situations. Those here outside the healthcare system and those in areas with weaker or no social security.\n\n<a href=\"/t/call-for-open-science-and-citizen-science-protagonists-how-do-we-build-ourselves-fairer-and-more-inclusive-healthcare/6248\">The track I curate</a>\u00a0at the festival investigates the role\u00a0science and research can play in a more resilient care system. Specifically we will zoom in on open science and citizen science in all their forms, and learn from real-life projects.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>Exploring the ecosystem</strong>\n\nThe past weeks have been an exploration of what is out there, which you don't get to do nearly enough when buried deep in your own project. It was a period of trying to spot connections, common issues and creative solutions. Talking to people and connecting them to each other. Outreach has been difficult at times. Being too busy truly is a sign of our times, all the more so for people exploring new ways. Things take time at the edge.\n\nThe people that I did have the pleasure to speak with, however, proved that there is a plethora of possible solutions, and challenges. Among them are an interdisciplinary researcher stewarding data on <a href=\"http://futurefootwear.org/\">walking mechanics for indigenous communities</a>\u00a0and an activist developing a way for individuals to\u00a0<a href=\"https://fourthievesvinegar.org/our-mission\">manufacture their own medications</a>. They have issues with legal battles and attracting talent, respectively.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>Biohacking Valhalla</strong>\n\nIn mid May I attended the <a href=\"/t/learning-about-sustainable-biohackerspaces-at-biofabbing-convergence-2017/6287\">BioFabbing Convergence</a>. Many European biohackers, citizen scientists and experts gathered in CERN, Geneva at Ideasquare. The conversations I had and the presentations I attended offered insight into running community science spaces, education and science activism on the edges.\n\nAmong participants, plans were made to take concrete action towards improving citizen science practices, one of which is the\u00a0<a href=\"https://github.com/DIYScience/DIYScience\">DIY Science Network</a>.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>Challenges</strong>\n\nChallenges I\u2019ve faced have been time related. Between being ill, crisis management for own projects and working with people scarce on time, getting concrete things done is difficult. It goes to show that being active in the fields that we are, does also mean being more vulnerable to factors outside of your control.\n\nGoing from interesting conversations in real life to stories on the platform, has also proven difficult. The Edgeryders platform is, quote, \u201chard to navigate or have an overview\u201d. We have noticed the same with people participating in the <a href=\"/t/open-insulin-research-group/787\">Open Insulin research</a>. Part of the solution is getting a hang of it, another part are improvements to how people navigate the site, which the Edgeryders team is constantly doing.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>Next up</strong>\n\nThere have been inspiring stories on the platform already for a while, some of which I have reached out to and will assist in drafting a session proposal over the next weeks. The community calls are a nice way to connect with everyone and discuss new ideas.\n\nAfter the community call of earlier today, the first sessions should be ready for scheduling over the next week. Additionally, I\u2019ll be getting more external people into the existing discussions, and inviting more people to share stories and session proposals.\n\nAny help with the latter is welcome: if you know of any inspiring people active in the field, let\u2019s get in touch!\n\n\u00a0\n\n<em><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-05607530-5fcb-663f-a944-17be37a4241e\">This blogpost has been realised as part of the OpenCare Community Fellowship Program with the support of SCImPULSE Foundation.</b></em>\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-31 18:51:52", "updated_at": "2018-11-22 21:15:36.719234", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 788, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 42.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9460, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 3680, "post_number": 2, "raw": "the list is exactly what we need to compose now, can we maybe meet on a hangout tomorrow afternoon/evening or the next day morning?

While the open source approach does have its drawbacks, it has a major advantage: you can keep tweaking it deep into the project. The result is something like co-evolution of platform and the community using it. Here's our latest tweaks, each one responding to an emergent need of the Egderyders project:posed to nesting our community in large, orderly, corporate social networks like Facebook, mainly for <a href=\"http://www.cottica.net/2011/12/05/zen-and-the-art-of-website-procurement-why-bureaucrats-should-get-their-hands-dirty-with-technology/\">accountability reasons</a>.

Users were still few, and each of us would have played at most two or three, and it was easy to keep track of who was doing that. Now, with six campaigns, 200 mission reports and well over a thousand comments, we need a sort of control room: so we coded a dashboard, that tells you what missions you have played yourself, what missions by other Egderyders you have been commenting, and suggests missions that you have NOT done, but could. For the same reason, we also included a search button on every page.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<a href=\"/sites/edgeryders.eu/files/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Dashboard.jpg\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6030bfe0d6e8bfcb460916a4a720ccde1c41b172.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"481\">\n\n</a>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>\"I want to meet this person\" button</strong>.

They (the funding programme) understand themselves as The Incubator in this case, so we would not want to touch their territory I guess :P\n\nBut. A sustainable marketplace is a possible thing to apply with imho. The pilot could be operated within the OSCE context, but ultimately the actors on it are exchangeable. The novelty is that, when using the Makerfox tech for this, it is a marketplace that allows to exchange items that nobody sells for money in affluent societies.\n\nMost used items simply get trashed when no longer wanted, some get donated, some break, but even broken ones consist of usable parts. But then, the problem is the wide variety of parts, unsuitable as raw material for production. Very suitable for hackerspaces though. Hackerspace people like to repair things. All repairs are shallow with many parts. For real. Like: look through the Internet for two hours to find a compatible spare part for a 10 yrs old jigsaw, hope it is compatible, order it, get it, of course it doesn't fit, set out to create your own part on a lathe, then find a compatible part around in boxes of stuff (from a broken jigsaw that left a few parts over). Happened to me last week. If people <em>would</em> offer these kinds of parts or broken machines in large numbers, all repairs would be easy rather than always being about trying ones luck again like now. They don't, because you don't get a reasonable amount of compensation currently: 5 EUR for a broken jigsaw on eBay, c'm' on, 97% of people don't offer it for that price. But if they can get repair services for their other broken items in return (which they'd normally also trash because service centers charge more for repairs than shops for the next gen of products), the situation changes. If you look at it, nothing is really broken. (My one-off biggest personal success was <a href=\"http://ma.juii.net/blog/beamer-plus-pj-020-erwerb-und-reparatur\">repairing a video projector</a> with a part of a street lantern, a Super8 switch, parts of neon tubes and a Tupper box. And two months ago I found <a href=\"http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/aapsfaq.htm\">THIS</a> long document on repairing AC adapters. Totally above my level of electronics, and a nice demonstration of what skilled people can do.)\n\nThe reason all this stuff does not get repaired is because \"it's not worth it\" when using standard labor and manufacturer-supplied spare parts. But when matching ten 90% non-broken things into nine 100% working things, it's different. So, we have this possible template for typical network barter deals on a sustainable marketplace:\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/e/efc2737fc11f8c73920f71e250a6026afef566a5.png\" width=\"424\" height=\"220\"><br>\n\nSo, a matching space for spare parts, broken things and repair skills, using a metro area like a giant distributed warehouse (would have to start locally, as there's little meaning to ship stuff worth 2 EUR in money). I guess with this, hackerspace and repair cafe people will get all their stuff for free, plus food and accommodation and more stuff that they repair for themselves and can sell for real money. Whether hackers make a business out of this or do it on a private basis, repair cafe style, is up to them. The marketplace is unaffected by that, earning a commission in barter value on its own.\n\nSorry, just raw thoughts here from a tired mind. \"<em>Could be creative, could be real nonsense.</em>\" You just don't know by yourself when you're tired :P\n\n", "created_at": "2015-02-26 00:01:12", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:42.504869", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 670, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [17485], "is_liked_by": [8, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26678, "user_id": 3580, "topic_id": 6275, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>boardgame</b>\n\nWhat about a life-sized board game?\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-15 17:51:36", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:27.708694", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 12, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23009, "user_id": 809, "topic_id": 1661, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>Great post ...thank you !</b>\n\nThank you for the courage to speak out loud on such an important topic !

Cela se manifeste cependant sous des formes diff\u00e9rentes chez les individus. Nous sommes tous diff\u00e9rents les uns des autres, alors les exp\u00e9riences varient par cons\u00e9quent elles aussi. J'ai trouv\u00e9 que ce livre consiste en fait en une succession de questions. L'auteur a r\u00e9ussi avec brio \u00e0 coucher sur papier l'ampleur des interrogations, et m\u00eame des frayeurs, qui prennent d'assaut celles et ceux \u00e0 qui cela arrive.

Great!\n\nI've been watching Alberto do the deep troubleshooting research which took him to see the bug in <a href=\"http://www.amara.org\">http://www.amara.org</a>. Awesome, and really surpassed my knowledge of the platform, which is quite basic.\n\nI just want to add the possibility of downloading the language you translate from. (In translation lingo I've seen it\u00a0called the \"pivot\" language, because it could be different from the original - say the original was in English, but you use the Spanish to translate into French, then Spanish would be your \"pivot\".) Then you can work off-line, and finally upload the text with your translation. If you download the file with a \"subtitles format\" (.srt and others), then the timetags are there for you, right\u00a0between the lines with the content. So you can download, substitute, upload.\n\nThis works well if you intend to be the sole translator (a short piece, doable in one go). I'm not sure how it goes if you do some percentage while others work in other parts. If you are in close communication with the other translators of your language you'd use email. If not, maybe an ethernet pad would do.\n\nThese are just options, forget them if they are confusing.\n\nThere are options other than amara.org: there was <a href=\"http://www.dotsub.com\">http://www.dotsub.com</a>\u00a0(old contender in the subtitle arena, maybe even before <a href=\"http://www.amara.org\">http://www.amara.org</a>\u00a0came in) and now youtube gives you the subtitles (with the added advantage of transcription from the soundtrack itself, but with - I think - a less mature transcription platform).

We could make the following argument.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Online collaboration is a cyborg system: part bits and wire (the tech), part meat (the humans). A fancier way to say it is that it exists in <strong>agent-artifact space</strong>.</li>\n\n<li>However, almost all designers of online collaboration focus on the tech/artifact part. Since they are not looking at the (far messier) human part, their success rate is unsurprisingly very low.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Edgeryders has a very significant experience of online collaboration. Not only (not even mainly) around software development, but around business projects, organizing conferences (LOTE), socializing the submission of applications (FormStorm), near-real time coordinating in social media communication (Twitterstorm) etc. The reason why we can do this stuff is that we are a diverse community with a significant hacker component, and the hackers' culture of documentation has been spreading.</li>\n\n<li>Documentation is the vector of sharing. It means: every time you do something you take time to document what you do with guidelines, instructions, tutorials etc., so that others can pick it up where you left off. This is very counterintuitive to do, because documentation is time-consuming for those who do the documenting; but it is superefficient, because information can be duplicated costlessly. A whole tribe of documenters moves at the speed of light: everybody spends some extra time when documenting what he or she does, but then saves ten times that time by virtue of easy access to the knowledge others have created. So, documenting is non-Nash, Pareto superior.</li>\n\n<li>Historically, hackers have solved this by creating a culture of documentation. This means acknowledging the hard work of people doing it well, rewarding them with attention and kudos etc. Preliminary experience in Edgeryders shows that this can be done also outside the hacker world. For example, the latest Living On The Edge conference generated <a href=\"/t/all-lote3-documentation-pick-up-from-where-we-left-off/2131\">a lot of documentation</a>, most of it pretty high quality. This both taught people to work together online (on wikis, comments and posts) and made the online space more attractive as its content grew in quality and coverage.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>So, we will\u00a0<em>not</em>\u00a0tackle this by building another platform. We will teach people to teach each other how to make tutorial, how to write an effective post, how to build and manage online communities (<a href=\"/u/noemi\">@Noemi</a>\u00a0and others keep <a href=\"/edgeryders-dev/edgeryders-community-managers-manual\">a wiki</a> for this in the context of Edgeryders \u2013 QED, I guess). Prototype it on some coops. And see.</li>\n\n<li>You guys can do the coop organizing and reachout and communication; we can take the lead on collaboration practices.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>", "created_at": "2014-04-14 18:40:57", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:43.046461", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 497, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [29255], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18123, "user_id": 460, "topic_id": 1330, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>brave or not?</b>\n\nIt is not a question of bravery...\n\nThe point is that I want to have fair government and you can not have that without fair elections and in order to have that you need to have clean situation with voters list.\n\nBut, the true problem is not even parliament elections - it is muncipal elections because we have situation where winner of election is elected by the people who are not living in the area or, in some cases, even live in different country.

Mr Hobbes and Mr Monbiot would both be proud of you I'm sure.\u00a0\n\nActually, 'we' did not make a state. States evolved as societies became more centralised and complex, and the elites needed protection from the people whose land they had stolen. The social contract is null and void. Contracts need to be signed by both sides to be legally binding.\n\nBut let's leave that to one side.\n\nI agree that 'a lot of nonsense is talked about community', but none of it is being talked by me, at least not here. You, on the other hand, have diverged into a random attack on 'tribal societies', which has no bearing on the point I was making. Who said anything about eskimos? Not me! Although I would say that a man from your background ought to know that many traditional socities were very good at carrying the weakest among them: considerably better than modern states, in fact. You'd be a damn site better off being mentally ill in village India than on a British sink estate in the care of the state psychiatric system.\u00a0\n\nMy point was that deracinated individuals always fare badly when things go pear-shaped, and they fare worse if they are foreign. It's a historical constant. Let's try and imagine what would happen if several million Greeks, Spaniards and Italians followed your advice and left their families, homes and connections behind to move to Sweden, Norway and Scotland. One of the things that would happen would be that those working welfare systems would cease to work due to the extra strain being put on them by sudden mass immigration (which has happened in parts of the UK.) Another thing would be that resentment would build towards the influx of outsiders, especially if they had come simply to take economic advantage of a system built by others. Nations and ethnic groups still exist, despite the EU's attempts to abolish them.\u00a0After that, we'd have new Anders Breiviks, Pim Fortuyns and Marine Le Pens poping up all over northern Europe. I think we could do without this.\u00a0\n\n'Community', at root, is simply a word used to describe the process of being rooted. You need to be somewhere for a while, bed in, contribute, become accepted. Then people start looking after you, and looking out for you. That, it seems to me, would be a lot more useful in a collapse than anything the welfare state could offer.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-23 17:54:31", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:39.799849", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 451, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [9690], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2170, "user_id": 1487, "topic_id": 2137, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<ul>\n\n<li><a href=\"/t/user-stories/340\">User Stories</a> - scripted (from video interviews) user stories from Lote3</li>\n\n<li>Minutes from community call discussing <a href=\"/t/post-lote3-priority-1-set-up-public-facing-website-placeholder-under-construction-page/2157/3\">website overhaul</a> - Nov 12, 2013</li>\n\n</ul>", "created_at": "2013-11-09 16:34:40", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:09.522749", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 44, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10963, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 5459, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Done</b>\n\nThanks for the heads up\n\n", "created_at": "2016-03-24 19:37:59", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:03.225484", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 10, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [7378], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19178, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 1884, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Ah it's the edit button near the top of the page</b>\n\nthen you just add your information through the wysisg editor.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-09-21 15:49:11", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:46.969466", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 26, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [19119], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25111, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3052, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Just a first step</b>\n\nNo panic, Ben. I am not planning to look for consensus, just carry out my own research into Protocol. I use some pre-alpha version of Protocol for everything I do, most notably lately Edgeryders. The unMonastery movement has no obligation whatsoever to pay attention to what I (or anyone else, really) think is \"good\" interaction protocol; you guys are free to ignore it, or to work on it in your own time, and most definitely to fork it. I am just doing some scribbling around. Even if everyone was super-enthusiastic about my ideas, I would be the first one to recommend caution.\n\nWhat I would really, really like is make a stab at a computational method to test bits of protocol. Take a candidate rule, for example \"Who does the work cllas the shot\" and see if you can meaningfully encode it into a NetLogo model, using these nifty tricks from computational biology that you see demoed so effectively in the paper I linked in my original post. That would be a \"meta-Protocol\", because it gives you a systematic way to think about how to make protocol.\n\nI have used different translations for the Rule that I found lying around the web. In later iterations I made a point of always reading the Latin original (I do read Latin, though I am a bit rusty. The Rule is in late Latin, as opposed to the classic Latin normally taught in Italian high schools, but I could understand it even without a translation, just with the help of a dictionary. I might even make a \"hacker translation\" myself).\n\nI was thinking probably around the central weeks of July. I also have a surprise for you: the mayor of Nursia has seen my RNext video and invited me over. Apparently Nursia now has a very active Benedictine monastery, revitalized by a charismatic American prior and full of young monks. He is up for organizing a visit, in which we may ask for the man's time to share his experience of living under the Rule. July 9th is St. Benedict's day.

it is desirable to help feed our legacy. \u00a0Several forms present themselves:</span></span>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>The Materan School of the unMonastery - </span><span>During the LOTE#3 meeting one group session focussed upon writing the 200 year history of the unMonastery movement. \u00a0One group explored the expansion of the movement and the significance of the Matera School in shaping its early success. \u00a0The group\u2019s chief perspective was that the rich associative matrix supplied by the ever present monastic tradition in the community provided a uniquely potent growth environment. \u00a0Maintaining the spiritual home of the movement as an active player in this environment would provide invaluable continuity.</span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>unEmbassy - </span><span>If the unMonastery is to downsize but maintain continuity in Matera, it\u2019s a natural \u00a0that the project changes shape to reflect it\u2019s scale. If MT2019 and the city wish to maintain it\u2019s connection to the networks of the project and it\u2019s partners who have bought it, it makes sense to instigate the first unEmbassy at the site of the unMonastery. Each project present will continue allowing individuals from unMonastery, EdgeRyders and other networks to further their work in the region on a more ad-hoc basis. The unEmbassy would house 3-4 diplomats at any one time, with additional support from a connection to other residency programs and spaces internationally.</span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>Leaving our finest unMonasterian in Matera \u00a0</span><span>Community development work defines its tangible growth one contact at a time.

Let\u2019s say I am wary about medicalisation of the human condition, so to me it is just sadness.\n\nWhen I was younger these dips were more profound. Debilitating even. At some point a psychiatrist prompted me to take medication. I refused, opting instead to deal with what I thought might be the root causes\u2026.by\u00a0changing my profession, lifestyle and social environment.\n\nEventually\u00a0I developed some resilience towards these\u00a0inexplicable bouts of sadness. I would channel the nervous energy into doing meaningful work, and supporting the efforts of others in trying to do something that matters to them. With hindsight it has been a better choice for me than spending a fortune I don\u2019t have on having a shrink try to figure out what is the matter with me\u2026and how to fix it.\n\nLast week, the sadness returned. This time I am unable to find solace in the work. I am unsure as to why. It is not dramatic and there is no cause for alarm. However, I\u2019ve noticed that the less time I spend on online, the better I feel. In part I think it is because\u00a0communication for work purposes and to stay in touch with people about whom I care increasingly happen in the same channels. Which is not sustainable in the long run. So I am leaving Facebook, Twitter and linkedin for now. I will not cancel my accounts, but will not be checking them on a regular basis or keeping them updated.\n\nIf you wish to stay in touch with me you have several choices:\n\n1) To be kept up to date with information about Edgeryders, unMonastery and future projects and opportunities I am involved in building, subscribe to <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/bfT5ZH\">Nadia at Work</a>.\n\n2) If you are interested in reading me on more general topics like culture, tech, politics, art, religion, science, travels and life in general, subscribe to \u00a0<a href=\"http://eepurl.com/bfT04r\">News from Nadia</a>.\n\n3) If you want to hang out you can always call me on skype (my alias is: niasan) or come visit me in Brussels, where I now live.\n\nI do hope you will choose to stay in touch one way or another.

Je dois, comme je l'ai fait pour Lyne, vous conseiller de lire \u00e0 propos de la neuropsychologie et, dans ce domaine, ce qui concerne les \u00e9tats de conscience. Vous avez les travaux de Francisco Varela, vous en trouverez sur de sites comme celui-ci\u00a0\n\nhttp://consc.net/mindpapers/\n\nPour quelle raison ce conseil? Ne pourrait-on pas se satisfaire du mode de connaissance que vous avez par l'exp\u00e9rience? Actuellement, nous savons que ce que vous connaissez par l'exp\u00e9rience est un \u00e9tat du cerveau de celui qui exp\u00e9rimente et le mysticisme est un \u00e9tat particulier du cerveau parfaitement observable.\n\nLes voies d'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat de mystique sont des exercices, qu'ils soient sous la forme d'exercices spirituels comme ceux d\u00e9crits par les mysticismes chr\u00e9tiens, musulmans, juifs, ou ceux des chamans ou ceux du tantrisme, etc.\u00a0\n\nLa pratique de ces exercices, leur invention, ont permi de s\u00e9lectionner des fa\u00e7ons de faire consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme efficaces.\n\nDans ce sens, le mysticisme est un \u00e9tat du R\u00e9el, il est une possibilit\u00e9 du R\u00e9el localis\u00e9e dans l'humain mais peut-\u00eatre dans d'autres types de vivants.\u00a0\n\nMais historiquement, \u00e0 ma connaissance, aucun mystique n'a d\u00e9crit la mani\u00e8re dont son \u00e9tat lui permettait d'\u00eatre en lien avec la r\u00e9alit\u00e9, au sens de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 sociale autrement qu'en se pr\u00e9sentant comme un ouvreur de porte, un leveur d'\u00e9nigme.\n\nA ce moment le mystique est comme un oracle tel celui de Delphes dont la conscience \u00e9tait alt\u00e9r\u00e9e par l'inhalation de gaz issus d'une faille de la cro\u00fbte terrestre.\u00a0\n\nOr, ce que vous proposez est de faire du mystique un acteur social et de l'\u00e9tat mystique un mode de relation avec autrui et, si j'ai bien compris, un mode de production de ressources.\n\nPour que votrep projet fonctionne, il me semble que vous devriez le penser comme une exp\u00e9rimentation. En tant qu'exp\u00e9rimentation vous \u00eates oblig\u00e9s d'argumenter votre dispositif par des connaissances certaines ou des hypoth\u00e8ses pos\u00e9es en tant que telles. Vous devez aussi dire ce que vous observez, comment vous allez l'observer, ce que vous attendez de votre observation.\n\nVous devez avoir un protocole d'observation partageable avec des gens qui ne partagent pas les m\u00eames hypth\u00e8ses que vous.\n\nJe sais que c'est un peu p\u00e9nible, plein de r\u00e8gles insupportables mais c'est le meilleur moyen me semble-t-il, pour savoir si vos hypoth\u00e8se sont valables, si vous devez en changer. Et ausi pour acqu\u00e9rir de la connaissance.\n\nVous pourriez utiliser une autre voie, celle de la mise en acte: vous vous comportez comme un mystique et vous tentez de rester en vie.

Nobody knows, because it\u2019s never been done. This document is a best effort attempt at clarifying what you can reasonably expect as you join unMonastery Matera in winter-spring 2014. </span></span>\n\n<h3><span><span>Tolerate messiness (you can make it better!)</span></span></h3>\n\n<span><span>To date, the unMonastery has been exclusively a </span><span>concept</span><span>. You will join the first-ever prototype instance of that concept: we\u2019re essentially building from the ground up. If you join this process then you will be playing a fundamental role in establishing its foundations. This is exciting , but it implies you should expect it to be messy and imperfect. </span></span>\n\n<h3><span><span>Take charge </span></span></h3>\n\n<span><span>The unMonastery is a low resource project (</span><a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/unmonastery-matera-budget\"><span>budget</span></a><span>) - which follows the EdgeRyders ethos of \u201cif you do not build it yourself, it will not get built\u201d and the unMonastery stone soup methodology \u201cif you come without your own ingredients and no desire to cook, then it\u2019s just rocks and cold water for dinner\u201d. Part of the experience is to learn how to make do: as an unMonasterian, you fully understand that you, of all people, can\u2019t make demands on the unMonastery beyond those outlined in the call for residencies (travel reimbursement, accommodation, per diem, small allowance for materials, social role as the city\u2019s innovator-in-residence). </span><em><span>There is no unMonastery as a separate entity</span></em><span><em>.</em> The unMonastery is you and your fellow unMonasterians. Growing it as a healthy institution is your collective responsibility and nobody else\u2019s.</span></span>\n\n<h3><span><span>Share a (beautiful) room</span></span></h3>\n\n<span><span>Unlike traditional monasteries, this iteration will not feature</span><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matera\"><span> cells</span></a><span>, instead it\u2019ll be more like small dorms/shared rooms with 2 to 5 people each (</span><a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/the-unmonastery-the-space-and-co-design-in-matera\"><span>building plan</span></a><span>). Room assignment will be sorted out by the unMonasterian brethren on site. Living, working, eating and sleeping together can be an intense experience, particularly when there\u2019s 10+ of us - like other aspects of the project we\u2019ll have to figure out how this works, but it\u2019s important to say this style of living is probably not for everyone. </span></span>\n\n<h3><span><span>Make the most of your unAbbott</span></span></h3>\n\n<span><a href=\"/u/ben\"><span>Ben Vickers</span></a><span> is one of the originators of the unMonastery concept and is to be Matera\u2019s unAbbott - note the \u2018un\u2019 in the title, this role isn\u2019t about authority but rather succinct facilitation of the collective effort. Whereas other unMonasterians, once their duties toward their brethren are done, are free to focus on their own projects, the unAbbott\u2019s key responsibility is to run smoothly the small unMonastic community in Matera. The role of the unAbbott is designed as a service to the community; whatever actions he takes, he will do so to forward that goal. You are expected to work with him by taking his advice very seriously, even if that means occasionally putting the well-being of the community above your own. If anything troubles you in your experience in the unMonastery, talk to him and he will try to sort you out. Conversely, should you come to be perceived as harmful to the work and peace of mind of other unMonasterians, the unAbbott is entitled to suspend your per diem and ask you to leave.</span></span>\n\n", "created_at": "2013-09-07 09:07:39", "updated_at": "2018-06-03 04:22:47.684892", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 745, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 25.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [82], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2100, "user_id": 173, "topic_id": 2067, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<h3 style=\"color:Blue;\">Active membrane</h3>\n\n<span>the unMonastery unGovernance through emergent rituals</span>\n\n<h3 style=\"color:Blue;\">The challenge \u00ad</h3>\n\nOn one side unMonks.

On one side it looked bit confusing, very unlikely someone else could easily help with tracking finances this way and even less take it over compleatly (in case Ben falls in love and goes offline for a honey moon (nicer image then 'getting hit by a bus' often used in agile development))\n\nAnother big issue I see with using such spreadsheets, relates to limitations they have in dealing with <strong>real wold assets</strong>. For example it comes very easy to put there \"budget for travel: 200euro\", but much hader to capture the acctuall need: \"elf needs to get to Graz Apr 8th the latest, we need transportation, options include car rideshare, train ticket, bus ticket, gliders ticket, hitchhiking buddy with confidence in this region, he doesn't travel by <s>jetplane</s>\u00a0or <s>teleport</s>\u00a0(<a href=\"/u/cristiano_siri\">@Cristiano Siri</a>\u00a0;)\n\nIMO those spreadsheets may strongly promote tendency to staying stuck in accounting around money. One can think: \"We need 200euro for elf's travel\" so now we need to look for someone to give us this money (<strong>virtual asset)</strong>. While with using some more multidimentional accounting, and having clarity what we really need in terms of <strong>real world assets</strong>. I also don't see spreadsheets integrating with interfaces where people can offer help with securing those assets. We looked at interoperable systems for sharing accomodations, food and mobility during first OuiShare Labs Camp in Paris, <a href=\"/u/nadia\">@Nadia</a>\u00a0participated in it first day :)\n\nI better get to the point .... I suggest focusing on developing open source software for next generation accounting. Something with expressivnes and flexibility to support <a href=\"http://polyeconomy.info\">multiple ways of accounting</a> at the same time. <strong>One of those ways</strong> of course could take advantage of <a href=\"/makerfox\">Makerfox / Economy App</a>\u00a0<a href=\"/u/matthias\">@Matthias</a>.\u00a0While writing <a href=\"https://trello.com/b/v0lScjmR/awards-challenges-applications\">application for 2014 Bucminster Fuller Challenge</a>\u00a0I had chance to think back again to the Bar Camp session in Strasbourg where unMonastery vision started to crystalize. We were talking about funding and grants but then opened conversation to *in-kind* donations and started looking at what it takes in terms of *real world assets* to run all those projects. I really hope that at least some of us can keep pushing this direction and help with avaiding falling back into money based planing! What I see as middle way approach, in the spirit of what we wrote in\u00a0<a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/hacking-grant-competitions-to-award-communities\">Hacking Grant Competitions to Award Communities</a>, we all can still keep available some monetary pool and use it all together as a <strong>fallback</strong>\u00a0for situations where finding alternative means of securing particualr asset turns out to hard.\n\nPossibly we could cooperate on it with <a href=\"http://www.codeforamerica.org/about/international/\">Code for All</a> network. I already annonced plans for starting CfA brigade in unMonastery:Matera, we had online call with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guedado\">Jacopo</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dottorblaster\">Alessio</a>\u00a0who explore two different approaches to Code for Italy. Next week I plan to meet with friends from Open Knowledge Fundation in Berlin who go full power with <a href=\"http://codefor.de\">Code for Germany</a>.\n\nIn long term such development would also contribute to possibility of people choosing to offer <strong>moneyless taxes</strong>, I would much more prefer that instead of <strong>people in Matera</strong> pay taxes in euros to city administration, and then unMonastery:Matera gets some of those euros from city administration and goes again to <strong>people in Matera</strong>\u00a0to buy food from them LOL ;-) Imagine if people could donate food directly to unMonastery and then have it accounted as alternative to taxes way of contributing to The Commons! Of course I don't see this pattern specific to Matera, we could just explore it there, co-develop digital tools supporting it and everyone could reuse it all around the globe :)\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-13 08:06:09", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:58.729901", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 749, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 10.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22393, "user_id": 1692, "topic_id": 3544, "post_number": 15, "raw": "Hi Baptiste,\n\nSorry for the confusion we made...

With a few others, I thought it would be nice to collect these links in one place, a sort of <em>one stop shop</em> for people interested in trasparency not just in theory, but in the practice of extracting information from public data. One thing led to another, and in less than two months <a href=\"http://www.spaghettiopendata.org/index-en.html\">Spaghetti Open Data</a> was online. We aggregated 32 databases at launch; not bad when you consider that <a href=\"http://www.data.gov\">data.gov</a>, with all the firepower of the Obama administration, started with 47.\n\nIt's only a small thing, but it felt right for various reasons.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Firstly, it is a concrete achievement. I have had enough of complaining about the idle government, the backwardness of Italian culture, the financial crisis, bad luck. I have precious little time to spare, and I would like to invest it on projects that pay me back by yielding some kind of result. The Spaghetti Open Data group has put in some work, and in a few weeks it produced something which <em>is actually there, and it works</em>. If you want to build something with Italian open data you can, right now, without having to wait for structural change or a new generation in government. All it took is some voluntary work and 41 euro for hosting, which I paid up very willingly (the italian government eventually came around to putting online dati.gov.it. It took them another year and a lot of handholding, and even now it is far from a thorough job. I like to think seeing citizens seize the initiative put some pressure on the government to take action)</li>\n\n<li>Secondly, it is intellectually rigorous. We had to ask ourselves the same questions that I imagine confronted the people in charge of <a href=\"http://www.data.gov\">data.gov</a> and <a href=\"http://www.data.gov.uk\">data.gov.uk</a>. Are statistic data open data? (Apparently not) Does it make sense for statistical and open data to be collected in the same place? (Apparently it does, so that citizens can correlate the ones with the others) How to organize metadata? (We went for compatibility with <a href=\"http://ckan.net/about\">CKAN</a>, as in data.gov.uk) we have mapped a possible way for Italian open data, and future legitimate websites of open data have an all-Italian benchmark that they can consider, or even copy.</li>\n\n<li>Finally, it is the expression of a small community of a mall number of bloggers, geeks and civil servants (about fifty at the start, about two hundred now) that worked together\u00a0 towards a common goal, across considerable cultural differences, showing mutual respect along the way. I have also had enough of bashing bureaucrats as stupid or evil. Some are just that, others are wonderful people and great war buddies. Most are reasonably clever, well-meaning people who happen to be very different from me: collaborating requires investing a little time and effort to come to understand each other. It is almost always worth it.</li>\n\n</ul>Later, the life of the Spaghetti Open Data crowd revolved around a very well-loved <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#%21forum/spaghettiopendata\">mailing list</a>. We used it to coordinate on several open data-related initiatives, helping and incouraging each other. Among those that I remember with the most fondness:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>a couple of civil servants\u00a0 joined forces with hackers from the Open Knowledge Fondation and the Guardian's datablog to release a fantastic dataset on public expenditure in a <a href=\"http://openspending.org/it-regional-accounts\">fully open and interactive form</a>\n</li>\n\n<li>we translated into Italian the OKN's <a href=\"http://opendatamanual.org/it/\">Open Data Manual</a> for free. In two weeks. And during the August holidays, when absolutely nothing gets done in the country.</li>\n\n</ul>In the future, I only want to do this sort of thing. I\u2019m done with declarations, petitions and talk. Simply <em>doing</em> is too much fun, even for a daydreamer like me. :-)\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-12 18:21:29", "updated_at": "2017-09-13 23:23:54.213781", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 752, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 16.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 648, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 615, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<strong>Four years ago, as we were planning our move to Brussels, <a href=\"http://www.cottica.net/2012/05/05/are-you-serious-about-lifestyle-innovation-collaborative-living-in-brussels/\">Nadia and I decided to look for flatmates</a>.</strong> Most of our friends and family members were rather puzzled: not many couples decide to share their apartment, though they can afford not to. We, however, thought it completely logical. Nadia is Swedish and I am Italian: at the time we lived in Strasbourg, France. That made us a migrant nuclear family, completely cut off from the network of emotional and material support that our friends and families of origin could offer. We were simply too isolated in our Strasbourg apartment, nice though it was; and we decided to try something different. So, we rented a much bigger apartment than we needed and asked the Internet for someone to share it with.\n\n<strong>Four years on, we think the experiment worked.</strong> For the last three years we have been living with Kasia and Pierre, a young couple of expatriates (Kasia is Polish, Pierre French). We really enjoy the co-habitation: the home feels more animated, and not a day goes by that we don't chat at least a little bit, over coffee or breakfast. We enjoy the big, airy living room overlooking the city. And, frankly, we appreciate that our lifestyle is really good value for money: thanks to the economies of scale implicit in family life, we pay a reasonable rent for a really nice space.\n\n<strong>Along the way, we discovered that what makes our living together so enjoyable is that we are so different from each other.</strong> We come from four different countries; we are of different ages (Pierre, the youngest, is 19 years younger than me, the oldest); we have very different jobs (Kasia is a dental nurse, Pierre is the manager of a fashion boutique, whereas Nadia and I both belong to the \"what is it that you do, again?\" tribe); Nadia and I travel a lot, whereas Kasia and Pierre tend to be in town most of the time.\n\nThis works well on many levels. On a purely practical level, when we travel we love the thought that the home is not empty, and in the event of some misfortune (think plumbing failure) they can intervene; and I am sure they enjoy the privacy and the extra space. We pay for electricity, phone and the Internet, they pay for the cleaning services \u2013 less paperwork to do. We have an extra room, which normally serves as Nadia's and my office; but it doubles up as a guest room for the guests of all of us.\n\nBut there is more to co-habitation than practicality. <strong>Kasia and Pierre are lovely people: and, crucially, they are <em>different</em> people from Nadia and myself</strong>. We live out the city in different ways. We have different takes on almost everything, from French politics to Belgian beer. Comparing notes with them is always interesting, and I really value their insights and wisdom. Not that we spend all that much time together. I think our co-habitation unfolded in the right sequence: we started by a default attitude of rigorous mutual respect of each other's privacy and spaces. Then, over time, we grew closer, started to share the occasional meal, the occasional outing; we met each other's friends and families, lovely people to the last one. Guess what: we have built a sort of familial-like arrangement in a foreign city, among people who were originally complete strangers to one another.\n\nIt's working well. So well that, when a year ago our landlord announced that he was reclaiming his apartment and we would have to move out in the summer, <strong>we decided to stay together, and to look for a new place as a four-people household</strong>. Eventually, we got more ambitious and thought, what the hell, we might as well grow the family. If four people can live so well together in a larger apartment, how would it work with five, or six, or seven in an even larger one?\n\nIt works well, it turns out. We moved to a lovely loft, and were joined by a third couple (Belgian-Italian). Giovanni and Ilaria have since moved on for family reasons, but we enjoyed their company while we lived together. Their place has been claimed by Thomas, a young French engineer.\u00a0\n\nWe do this for totally egoistic reasons: we enjoy each other's company, we save money, we live in style. At the same time,<strong> we are aware that we are working our way through solving a global problem</strong>. Planet Earth has <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/els/mig/World-Migration-in-Figures.pdf\">230 million international migrants</a>; intra-EU migrants like us <a href=\"http://hiva.kuleuven.be/nl/docs/presentaties/20141013_03_LaurentAujean.pdf\">are 8 million</a>. Many of Europe's young people simply cannot afford to hold their ground: their work, education paths, and love lives lead them to migrate. When they do, they, like us, lose their supporting networks, and it is really hard to rebuild them. Living together, especially in diversity \u2013 the older with the younger, the sporty with the mobility-challenged, the academic with the blue-collar worker \u2013 becomes a platform for sharing our different abilities, and being able, as a household, to solve many different problems, both emotional and practical.\n\nNone of this is new. You have heard it all before \u2013 at social innovation conferences and workshops, for example, and typically by people who live in middle-class nuclear families. <strong>But we have decided to walk this particular talk;</strong> it will probably not be the right choice for everyone, but it is the right choice Nadia, Kasia, Pierre and myself; and I strongly believe it might be right for many others. I encourage you to at least consider it for yourself: as more of us make this choice, the real estate market will respond, giving us more spaces suited to our particular lifestyle (in Brussels, for example, is very difficult to find large apartments with 3 or more bathrooms!).\u00a0So, who wants to join?\n\n", "created_at": "2016-04-01 08:20:09", "updated_at": "2018-05-26 08:15:50.088934", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1069, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 926.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17737, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 2647, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>I'm still thinking about this</b>\n\nHaven't forgotten...it's taking some time to take shape, what I would write.

I'll be meeting old friends, which may make me unreliable, but perhaps I can activate some of them for this as well, so...\n\nJust for your orientation, I'll try to put it in a nutshell - but it'll be fuzzy around the edges (on purpose, let's see if we can dock other things from your side into this (I have truckloads):\n\nI want to rebuild the small series/prototype manufacturing sector into a strongly digitally connected net of physical clusters. These are to function as a shared element of an innovation platform. The physical parts of it are relatively expensive, so we will try to work with what is there in most cases (business parks, research institutes, universities, some companies). However <em>below</em> that level (about fablab, library, or small business/large club facilities) I'd want to spec out a bunch of tweaks &amp; investments that will allow dramatically improved collaboration &amp; information sharing. There'll be lots of thorny privacy and IP issues but we'll get to that later.\n\nA quick example: You had an idea a few weeks ago and have hit a problem, so you take some data about this and meet with a friend and potential partner at one of the closest hubs of the net (e.g. in a fablab, library, or small business that offers those). There you feed the data (which you may not have wanted to upload for privacy reasons) into the system which will directly scrape out and correlate the semantically significant bits in the background. While you explain to your potential partner what it is you are trying to do (ideally in your native language), by going through some files together. You use a lightly modified presentation device (it does not just to next slide, but also allows you to give 3-4 relevant semantic/logic infos) the system listens, translates to text and correlates again. After about an hour of discussion it slowly starts to shows a few pertinent images of the things/concepts you are talking about, whenever it detects from your speech pattern that some help with clarification would be useful now. It listens to find out which are the images that you meant, and which ones may have surprised you (in a positive way), and tries to figure out where it misunderstood you. After 2 hours you are pretty much done for the day and ask the system to wrap up the documentation for you with focus on easy onboarding (as opposed to for example a detailed user manual style), in file sizes of 50 kB, 50 MB, 500 MB. Just before it finishes the system asks if and to what level it should crawl and correlate, or even alarm your respective social networks, and if you are looking for a long term partner or just someone to fix a problem (e.g. more or less emphasis on social compatibility). After having a look at the relevant public calenders it suggests 3 different options on various dates as next steps, and updates your social web settings with your consent. You decide to keep the project in a separate persona for now, and decide later which one of your peer-certified identities it should influence and how.\n\n6 months later, while you were discussing the system correlation meter spiked several times in a short time, and you decide to take a look. It turns out you have hit on a related problem from a totally different angle, that a heavily funded strategically working group mostly based in Korea and Japan are going crazy about. You authorize them to a predominantly automatically generated (translated and original) high level wrap up of your project, and also give them the last 100 hours in high detail, under mutually agreed terms (including you being able to watch them looking at it). After minimal back and fourth it becomes clear that according to their project plan you would want to start working intensively with them in approximately 3 months. That means you really have to start searching for someone who can bridge the language and well as the technical details. Unfortunately most people with this combination seem to be very busy at the time, so you may have to free someone up. Finally the system finds a pair of students that is in very close contact and shares the necessary skills between them (even though they won't move and quite a bit out of anyone's way). You make them an offer to help them with their current task (after talking with their teacher) and thus get them ready to join your project a little earlier.\n\nOf course this is not going to be done tomorrow, but I'd like to build a plausible vision using mostly off the shelf tech (no moonshots) and showing some of the potential as well as some of the problems. I think the current European situation is close to optimal for bootstrapping this to life. We have a potentially powerful economic sector, relatively well educated workforce, and a totally defunct structure that damns half the population who need to invent the future NOW sitting on their hands, feeling useless. This will not do. Also, we have language barriers that come at an <em>immense </em>cost of opportunity (p2p in europe?), which to the elite perhaps does not exist, because they seem oblivious to them both. We are not going to get this fixed tomorrow, because this is BIG, but if we don't seriously start to do things about this we're not getting anywhere. So in the spirit of: \"Who fails to plan, plans to fail.\" I'd like to build a (couple of) cases for such a innovation network architecture.\n\nThe EU translates <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/translation/faq/index_en.htm#faq_2\">3.5 billion characters</a> (Giga chars) per year for its 500 M citizens.

Let me cut in with a quick thought:\n\nAlberto may indeed be right that education always develops in interdependence with the mode of economy. I'd want to add, it can be a few decades behind the development of economy paradigms, and thus create friction by not educating people any more for what they will experience in their life.\n\nAs for the big picture, I see the paradigm of economy change again since ca. 15-20 years: away from masses of people working in industrial mass production, to a mode where robots do production, and humans develop robots. (Admittedly this is a quite \"local\" phenomenon in this so-called \"developed\" world, while much of the rest\u00a0 of the world did not even enter the industrial age .... And I don't think we're heading for \"service centric economy\", as we'll have too much hardcore resource problems in the future to still just employ each other for manicure and selling obscure financial \"products\".)\n\nIn this sense, the industrial education does no longer fit - we need now highly creative (both highly focused and cross-disciplinary) people to build complex robot systems and to tackle unsolved problems of humanity, like sustainability and long-term stable self-management of societies.\u00a0 And from reading through the Edgeryders education paper, it seems many of us do feel this discrepancy, and so started to educate themselves as they see fit ...\n\nFrom reading stories yesterday about the patronizing and sanctioning done by the German federal job agency, it seems to me more and more that keeping people in dependent employment is a means of political control. \"The state\" is reluctant to go forward to this new age, where it would lose much of its control over the industrial age \"masses\". To get a taste of the new age, take a look at <a href=\"http://www.roboeco.com/\">Robotic Wageless Economy</a> (take with a grain of salt - the site is not taking itself too serious, but has some cool verbalizations ...).\n\n", "created_at": "2012-09-15 00:57:45", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:21.261956", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 355, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6085, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 6052, "post_number": 1, "raw": "_\"Crazy people will find each other even if they are separated by nine hills\"_ \n_\u2013 Bulgarian proverb_\n\nThis post is a summary of how we built an appreciated event  in 3 weeks, and what we learned from it about building intense, collaboration and support. It is a relevant template for building OpenVillage house projects, and also the whole OpenVillage movement itself.\n\n# TIME AND RESOURCES REQUIRED\n\n<ul>\n<li>Community manager constantly monitoring collaboration channels, welcoming new people, and doing outreach. Time required: 4 weeks, full time.</li>\n\n<li>Tech lead to interface with volunteers: Matthias was very helpful in quickly setting up hosting etc.</li>\n\n<li>Program lead to interface with speakers, workshop leaders etc.</li>\n\n<li>Cash for initial fronting of costs (deposit for venue rental, equipment rental/purchase, WP theme, Hosting, purchase of t-shirts and hoodies). Approximately 6k.</li>\n\n<li>Comfortable accomodation for project team as close to event venue as possible. Organsing an event is exhausting. By the end of the day you want to isolate yourself in a calm comfortable environment, have a good solid breakfast maybe even exercise. Go upstairs for short naps when needed. etc</li>\n</ul>\n\n# HOW TO MAKE IT HAPPEN\n\n### 1. SET UP YOUR COLLABORATION ENVIRONMENT AND MAKE IT EASY FOR OTHERS TO DO THE SAME\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Set up your collaboration environment before making an open call for involvement.</strong> Choose the infrastructure you will be using for coordination and up to date communication, and stick with it. E.g.  WIKI  + Automatically updated WP site +  Embedded/integrated self hosted RIOT/Matrix installation + Self hosted crowdfunding application. </li>\n\n<li><strong>Make it easy for people to set up their own instance of the collaboration environment. </strong>Craft a deal with a webhosting company to offer a pushbutton installation of your website/communication infrastructure.</li>\n</ul>\n\n### 2. PIGGYBACK, BUILD VALUE AND KEEP IT SIMPLE\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Piggy back a BIG thing and find something that could solve a painful problem  for lot of people to draw people in</strong> ( withe OPENandChange it was funding applications, 33c3 it was tickets , with others it can be some missing/special feature that would add to people's experience). <em>Does it make something cheaper? Does it save you time ? Does it make something new possible?</em>\n</li>\n\n<li><strong>Select your location very early in the game and make sure it is VERY convenient for participants.</strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>Keep logistics around rewards very simple, low risk</strong> cheap e.g. create agreement with on demand services for Swag: Set up an online shop - Regular and limited edition collectors items. <em>(MIXMAX had a good vendor I think but we need one in Europe and ideally run by community member). </em>\n</li>\n\n<li><strong>Auto-delegate tasks: </strong>whenever an individual says \"we/someone should do x\" your response should be \"Great idea! Can you help make it happen? Great go ahead and do it! you're in charge of that!\" and quickly plugin our own resources to support their efforts. This leads to \"These guys trust me, now I owe it to them\"</li>\n\n<li><strong>Prepare excellent content relevant to people we wish to involve in our own projects: </strong>presentations, books and podcasts. I did a lightning talk at 33c3 as well as a longer <span> </span>in depth design discussion during alt33c3. Result: It looks like we have a collaboration with SHA , a summer event for the ccc community (hackers) to piggyback their event for the work of building the mobile demo of interoperable care projects</li>\n</ul>\n\n### 3. PROVIDE A CHOICE OF WAYS TO CONTRIBUTE\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Get a list of the things you would need money for early on:</strong> Equipment, Supplies, travel, outreach, writing.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Prepare rewards to \"sell\" for contributions early:</strong> Produce special edition armbands, t-shirts and hoodies (different logo/design for every event edition).</li>\n\n<li><strong>Make many options for donating money: </strong>Bank Transfer, Crowdfunding App, BItcoins, Paypal type service</li>\n\n<li><strong>Make a big public announcement and call for money AND contributions of equipment. </strong>Make sure it annoys some people who will complain: nothing solidifies resolve like an adversary.</li>\n</ul>\n\n### 4. SET AN ENCOURAGING AND SUPPORTIVE CULTURE\n\nIf we want to engage a strong core group of people in driving something together as volunteers, we should include the following three things in our default interactions with one another: \n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hire a community manager to welcome new people personally,  coordinate the work, and interface with the </strong><strong>edgeryders</strong><strong> organisation</strong> (for handling anything requiring an administrative interface e.g. for renting venues)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Provide information about what kind of help Edgeryders can offer to the person driving the initiative </strong>and who to contact (community manager).</li>\n\n<li><strong>Build a budget of easily available cash to remove the small initial hurdles to getting started.</strong> Little hurdles early on can kill momentum. Make sure you have a bundle of small money (cash) available to cover small initial costs e.g. Deposit for venue rental,  nice WP theme, server space. ca 6k. E.g Awsome fund.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Recruit a community manager to welcome new people personally,  coordinate the work, and interface with the edgeryders organisation</strong> (for handling anything requiring an administrative interface e.g. for renting venues)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Encourage the first ideas:</strong> Make the default response when anyone suggests some new idea \"great idea! I can put a little time into helping you to make it happen. Let's talk\". Get person to do the first writeup and call to action, and amplify it through social media channels.</li>\n</ul>\n\n### 5. MAKE IT EASY TO BUILD LOCAL INSTANCE / FORK\n\n<ol>\n<li>Produce push-button infrastructure.</li>\n\n<li>Produce a calendar of relevant events to piggyback (ones on which a critical mass of the people you want to reach/involve are focused)</li>\n\n<li>Produce easy to use/modify key template budget for people to fill in for event and crowdfunding campaign</li>\n\n<li>Produce easy to use/modify template communication material and gif snippets modelled on what we produced for alt33c3 (one call to action per flyer with cute icons of what is needed), and event checklist</li>\n</ol>\n\n# LESSONS LEARNED ABOUT EVENT DESIGN\n\n<ul>\n<li>People appreciated a calm, intimate environment dedicated to deep practical learning (e.g. Varbaeks GSM sniffing workshop which ran for 3 days and the surface mount electronics workshop) and peer to peer connection. </li>\n\n<li>People really liked the setup with several things happening in the same venue at the same time:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Divide room into four sections via projector stands: three for continuous livestreaming of interesting content, one for presentations and workshop visuals</li>\n\n<li>Have drop in and hang out area as well as gaps in the program for participants to fill in by proposing sessions to do themselves or from people they pull in.</li>\n\n<li>For running multiple live-streaming from the eventn we found a great technical solution:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Projectors getting video material via raspberry PIs, not laptops. <em>Make instructable from material on Slack channel</em></li>\n<li>Audio broadcast via FM radio (people were asked to bring a simple FM reciever (e.g. in their mobile phone) + headphones. <em>Make instructable from material on Slack channel</em></li>\n<li> We should produce little booklets for the different projects and fill with cases/stories to sell during events.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n<li>NB: <strong>we need to be mindful of the audio (people speaking) when we are organising things in the same space</strong>. Some conversations being too loud would interfere with eg. workshops.</li>\n</ul>\n\n</li>\n</ul>", "created_at": "2016-12-31 09:30:12", "updated_at": "2017-08-09 00:00:42.655530", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1303, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 51.4, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 4934, 5083], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13819, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 1407, "post_number": 25, "raw": "hey Betta, I'll keep you in the loop about the PHD.

And it's not fun at all, it's boring and you sit down in meetings where nothing ever interesting comes up, and you have to have A LOT of initiative to make something happen. Everyone is sort-of friendly, young professors, and willing!, that's the part I don't understand, but nothing happens. Everybody is busy wit own projects, and real collaboration and high performance doesn't happen, although seemingly everyone wants to and is open.\n\nThis is tricky because this means there's room for innovation, but if you're the kind of person needing to be hand-holded, it ain't gonna happen. And unfortunately I am. I want to study alongside people, not on my own because I don't think I can progress this way.\n\nOh, and then there's Bridget's thoughts on this posted as <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/reality-check/mission_case/my-skills#comment-1360\">comment here in this discussion</a> , which sums up so well the value of work in this closed field:\n\n<em>I don't even know what you mean by tenures, ISI, web of science etc. I don't mean to be cynical at all about academia, because I really value the research and teaching they do.

It came up to us through some interviews we and friends conducted in the last weeks with refugees or other newcomers in Berlin. What are your thoughts on this?\n\nTo make it easier for everyone interested to follow I will try to sum up the thoughts we had and the experiences we made recently.\n\nStarting with the question \u201cHow can food help people on the move to feel at home wherever they are at the moment?\u201d amongst others we got to talk to a 24 year old guy from Syria and a girl from Korea about the same age. One had to flee home and the other moved for love.\n\nSome of the most remarkable insights we got are about food some are not. Two I want to share because they add to our design question.\n\nThe guy misses the <strong>Syrian nights </strong>where as he tells everyone takes their coaches and pillows outside, drinks tea, smokes, chats and just sleeps on the streets. Maybe this does not happen in big towns he says but in villages as in smaller or medium-sized towns it does.\n\nThe girl told us that she is missing the <strong>Korean street food</strong> a lot. Once she tried out a Korean street food market here in Berlin, but did not like it. She went there with some friends, to chat, meet new people and have some good Korean food but it ended up being too expensive, there was even an entrance fee and the food was just not good. In Korea she always used to eat outside with her friends. Cooking was a family thing; eating out was for all other social events.\n\nAfter those interviews we talked about the \u201c<a href=\"http://collidoscopeberlin.com/2013/08/01/happy-weekend-toi-toi-toi-thai-park/\"><strong>Berlin Thaipark</strong></a>\u201d, were mostly Thai women sell homemade southeast Asian dishes on their blankets more or less being tolerated by the bureaucracy; about a great project by the New York based designer Candy Chang called <a href=\"http://candychang.com/work/street-vendor-guide/\"><strong>Street vendor guide</strong></a> where she visualizes the most commonly violated rules in this context for the vendors themselves; and asked ourselves: <strong>How can we enable migrants to integrate the interactive food customs / traditions they like and bring from their culture of origin into Berlins community life?</strong>\n\nLater on one of our fellow students told us the following:\n\nA group of Syrian refugees mentioned the <strong>huge summer barbecues</strong> they would always have in summertime back in Syria: a lot of friends, family, a lot of food, somewhere in the nature, in a park. When being asked if they are doing similar activities here in summertime they deny. They think that it is forbidden to have a barbecue anywhere outside and do not want to act against the law seen their uncertain status. Still they miss them.\n\nThat basically is how we ended up facing the design question already mentioned above: How can we help newcomers to use public spaces to their full extent, because they do not know what activities are legal in these spaces and are afraid to act against the law?\n\nSo far we, a group of 4 university students, call our little project <em>A Taste of Home</em> and would be more than happy about any comments.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-05-22 20:49:23", "updated_at": "2018-05-24 13:59:32.702405", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 646, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 6.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4515, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 4482, "post_number": 1, "raw": "**_Available in: :gb: [English](#en) / :ar: [Arabic](#ar)_**\n\n----------\n\n## :gb: **_English version_** <a name=\"en\"></a>\n\n##Future Makers: Collaboration costs effort, can we show that it can be repaid by scientific means?\n\nOur hypothesis is that Duplication of effort happens, and networked collaboration could fight it and help us all achieve our objectives and achieve impact at scale by enabling us to make better use of our time and small resources. \n\nIn Spot the Future we discovered that there is a need and desire for collaboration and that learning to work in networks could be a way to achieve this. In the stewardship we explored whether it is possible for networked communities to achieve complex tasks at scale, specifically we asked whether networked communities could take care of public assets like unused buildings.\n\nSo far we have looked at the supply side- that it has a high cost to collaborate, to keep a network going. In future makers we focus on the demand side,: is there actually a benefit to collaboration? Is there something to benefit for me? What is most off-putting about it?\n\n###PHASE ONE (3 months)\n\n[b]is to collaboratively produce a book which is the collection of case studies with analysis and graphics.[/b] The book will provide people an opportunity to discover and draw inspiration from what people in similar situations are doing in different parts of the world, and use their methods. In the book we collaboratively produce 70 case studies from Armenia, Belarus, Egypt, Georgia, Morocco, Nepal and the Ukraine. We will analyze the case studies to identify areas where collaboration may be necessary.  The book is mental framework to make gathering case studies easier for engagement manager and person contributing case studies. What would a program for sustaining network collaboration look like?\n\n###How do we produce it?\nWe will use a three step process.\n\n* [b]Collecting the stories [/b]\n\n* [b]Analysing the stories[/b]\n\n* [b]Producing a high quality book[/b] which presents case studies and analysis in a practical, easy to understand format that is useful for time-hungry innovators and activists\n\n###How do participants contribute?\n\n[b]one to many:[/b] each participant gives their story in exchange for a book edgeryders is writing as a whole\n\n[b]one to one:[/b] each individual is sharing their stories in exchange for a service from a member of the community\n\n###What's in it for contributors? \n\n[b]Good for you:[/b] Exposure (being featured in the book), discovering what other having access to global community of people with different skills and resources who can help you take your work to the next level. \n\n[b]Good for everyone: [/b]\n\n* Discovering what interesting projects and people are near you, how they/we are working.\n* Identifying concrete ways how we can get mutual benefit from one another.\n\n###How to get involved/join the initiative?\n\n* [b]Join one of the weekly community calls:[/b] [Egypt](https://edgeryders.eu/t/we-talked-now-we-build-after-spot-the-future-and-lote4-edgeryders-is-hiring-from-armenia-belarus-egypt-georgia-morocco-and-ukraine/4370) or [Global. ](https://legacy.edgeryders.eu/en/node-4554/future-makers-global-call-2-building-the-core-0)\n\n* [b]Help develop posted stories into high quality case studies:[/b] Read the posted stories and leave comments with thoughtful questions and suggestions, links to relevant projects or resources\n\n* [b]Submit a story about yourself and your work.[/b] Sign into Edgeryders (you just need an email address), and post your story in the [Future Makers Global group.](https://edgeryders.eu/t/future-makers-global/599)\n\n* [b]Spread the word and involve more people in the project.[/b] The more people that get involved, the better this project will be.\n\n* [b]Got other ideas?[/b] We are open to all kinds of collaborations and contributions. Get in touch with the team by introducing yourself in the [Future Makers Global group](https://edgeryders.eu/t/future-makers-global/599) and what you would like to do and we will do our best to support you.\n\nPHASE TWO (After the book is produced)\nis extracting tasks from the case studies to help the people and projects who participate, and engaging the global community to  help to complete the tasks. Each participant picks one other participant and finds out what is valuable to him or her: If it the person says money- then its what is it they need money to finance? Use tasks to define what each person needs as a concrete need and call for action (think of it as a kind of problem pile). Then we collaboratively build a massive social media campaign to drive engagement towards completing the tasks.\n\n###PHASE TWO (After the book is produced)\n\nis extracting tasks from the case studies to help the people and projects who participate, and engaging the global community to  help to complete the tasks.

Whether this is a feature of the overall LOTE is up for debate.

Demarking individuals with specific roles would potentially make them approachable and the existing structure of unMonastery transparent on the day \u2013 having a set of unfulfilled roles could also be an interesting method of recruitment. \u00a0The function of idea is similar NPCs in computer games: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character</a> (NPC\u2019s of the unMonastery?)\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Suggested formatting for session proposals is this:\n\n<a href=\"/t/making-lote3/360/video-documentation-and-upskilling-at-lote\">/t/making-lote3/360/video-documentation-and-upskilling-at-lote</a>\n\n(but Bembo commented that they could be sexier):\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>Logistics</strong>\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ben to more closely co-ordinate with Andrea.\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 First set of international call applications to be processed this week.\n\n<strong>Communication and Promotion of unMonastery &amp; LOTE3:</strong>\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Basic approach to promoting the project is being discussed here:\u00a0<a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/circulating-unmonastery-lets-push-things-forward\">/t/unmonastery/315/circulating-unmonastery-lets-push-things-forward</a>\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Twitter Conference, we discussed on the last call has been fleshed out significantly \u2013 we\u2019ve pencilled in the 16<sup>th</sup> of September as the date.

From online conversations to on-site collaborations in caring-related activities</h3>\n\nOpenCare is a research project delivered by a consortium of universities and SMEs, who assembled an online community with over 200 participants. Its main goal is prototyping a community-driven model for health and social care. The project\u2019s approach is inspired by the increasing mobilization of global, heterogeneous DIY and hacker/hacker-like communities<span>. They are\u00a0characterized by a propensity to look for solutions, efficiency in action and radical\u00a0openness in their\u00a0practice. OpenCare reflects and is designed along those principles and constitutes itself as\u00a0</span><strong>a bottom-up, digital, civic European arena about healthcare.</strong>\n\nAt this point in time, OpenCare has achieved half of its goals: the prototype of a care-oriented digital space is working at full scale, facilitating different kinds of care-related events, from stories of individual\u00a0<s>personal </s>experiences, to conversations about how to improve existing health and political systems and ultimately collaborations between participants both on and offline.\n\nThe paper discusses <s>these </s>results in terms of the politics of everyday life: contributions to the platform are political actions taken by citizens who, while mobilizing to solve\u00a0specific care-related problems (or creating preconditions for these solutions) make a political statement on the viability of an open, collaborative care system. The connections forged across sometimes disparate geographical locations and the knowledge<s>s</s> shared through the online platform constitute new forms of online political engagement that translate into offline action. Story-sharing increases connectivity, facilitates the movement of new ideas across health and social care contexts, and leads to emergent\u00a0<s>creates new and unexpected </s>political alliances.\n\nWe analyze this activity using an interpretative model that can be summarized in this way:\u00a0the care-oriented digital space (i.e. the one realized in the OpenCare research framework) is considered as a space of possibilities. By this we mean, firstly, an environment where different care-oriented events take place and are generated by <s>the self-driven \u201chacker mindset\u201d of participants </s>self-driven participants with a \"hacker mindset\". Secondly, this space is characterised by the affordances that are embedded in it and influence the <s>existence and </s>evolution of events.\n\nIn this conceptual framework, the discussion on when and how this space of possibilities becomes an arena for the politics of everyday life is done by observing when and how people meet in it, share information, start conversations and collaborations, and move from the digital space to a physical one. In order to do so, the paper presents four steps:\n\n1) Prior events are analysed to give a general overview on how this space of possibilities has worked and is working.\u00a0This happens in two steps. First, ethnographic coding of over 2,000 written contributions is performed:\u00a0Next, the graph of relationships between ethnographic codes is examined by methods borrowed from graph theory. Specifically, we define a social network of interaction in the conversation. We then\u00a0use the count and reach across the social network\u00a0of co-occurrences of ethnographic codes as indicators\u00a0of across-conversation\u00a0convergence. This adds a quantitative dimension to the qualitative conclusions of\u00a0our ethnography.\n\n2) Meaningful events, where online conversations evolve into potential collaboration and action\u00a0<s>and their evolution from </s>, are evaluated through the participants' motivations and their specific background cultures. This will be done using ethnographic primary data (347 posts and 1590 comments) and secondary data (3300 annotations and codes), as well as design tools.\n\n3) Spaces of possibilities are considered to evaluate step by step the relationships between the events, their environment, and the different implicit and explicit affordances embedded in the platform.\n\n4) The data\u00a0is then analyzed with a focus on the implications and potentialities of the interactions on Open Care for the participants\u2019 politics of everyday life.\n\nThe article concludes by introducing threads of research to be developed in the coming months, inside OpenCare and after its conclusion.\n\n(Short bibliography)\n\n<span>Akrich, Madeleine (2010). </span>\u00ab <span>From Communities of Practice to Epistemic Communities: Health Mobilizations on the Internet </span>\u00bb<span>, <em>Sociological Research Online</em>, 15. </span><a href=\"https://hal-mines-paristech.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00517657\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span>https://hal-mines-paristech.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00517657</span></a>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>Manzini, Ezio (2015). </span><span>Design, When Everybody Designs.

Unfortunately, this is only possible after an asset got offered and ordered, so cannot help the seller to assign an adequate value. The other alternative would be to use a system like on <a href=\"http://www.netcycler.com/\">NetCycler</a>, which tries to match assets based on their physical properties (product type, size, colors etc.). That is however <em>horrible</em> from a UI point of view, as all this formfilling is very unpleasant work. What would work is using ISBN / EAN codes for this, and also apply it to easily standardized bulkware (like yes, apples). We did not add this for now as we focus on the DIY economy, not on (used) industrial products. So most of the stuff offered on the platform will not have ISBN / EAN ...\n\nOk, but I remember that I often use the \"search in past transactions\" feature on eBay when trying to estimate a good offer price for a product. That would work in network bartering as well. Noted, thanks!\n\nAbout value / valueing: of course value is extremely subjective. A seller assigning a price means, thus, that the seller values the item equivalently and would not like to give it away for less. A price is thus a threshold for how much a potential buyer has to value an item at the minimum in order to enter into a transaction with the seller.\n\n(About intentcasting: prices can be assigned to tasks, which are service-assets sought by a buyer. Again in terms of UI, I do not see a way to implement seek ads for <em>products</em> as a meaningful feature. Products need to be standardized to be produced efficiently (also in a DIY / maker economy). That's how they differ from services. So for services, it makes sense that the buyer can publish a very specific request what has to be done, while for products, it makes no sense and it should instead be left to the buyer to select the best match out of the existing products on offer.)\n\nThere is a very interesting affordance in a barter economy that allows to not have any public pricing at all. I think you will like this idea, so I just copy it here (though we won't implement it because, to reach volunatry adoption for this first-ever network barter platform, we align as closely as possible with concepts that ordinary people already know about economic transactions):\n\n<strong>Bid pricing with individual units of account</strong>\n\nThis is to solve the problem of value skewing / prejudice which is inherent whenever using one unit of exchange for one market. Examples of these problems include: (1) In forex currency exchanges, economies of developing regions get disadvantaged when importing as their currency is weak. And this means everyone gets disadvanatged, even though there are some companies who produce as efficiently as those in developed regions. And (2) when using legal tender as unit of account in a barter economy, the prices from currency-based markets will be used as references. This is bad, since these prices include all kinds of skewing influences, including state subsidies, artificial scarcity, extremely cheap offers enabled by industrial production and artificial price increases for example of labor by heavy taxation and regulation that limits the supply on offer. With such prices as reference, maker production is hardly possible for example, as it cannot compete with industrial production (used goods, for example).\n\nThe solution is to let everyone price their own offers in a self-selected unit of account, which has to be one of their own active offers. So people will select to use their main offer (like: an hour of their professional service) as unit of account, and express bid prices for things they want in this, and also how much their other offers are worth in comparison. In effect, all people have a very natural unit of account, just as when using legal tender, or even more natural (like saying \"I would work half an hour for this.\").\n\nThe more important effect is, however, that pricing is now always adequate for every situation of peoples' offers and demand priorities. It does not get skewed by external influences, but is similar in effect to what people would agree when negotiating a barter deal manually. Just that it can still be completely automated: user A expressed that she wants a certain amount of (say) A-hours for a certain offer, and how many A-hours she would work for certain wishes, and from this the system can know when a deal is balanced for her. And when it's balanced for every participant, it is a valid deal.\n\nThe best property of this idea is probably that it is applicable for exchange between all kinds of alternative economy networks and communities: They might never agree on using any standard value of account (some might be against using legal tender as that, some against shopping baskets, some against using an alternative currency because of, some against using any unit that they are not familar with etc.). But when allowing everyone to use their own unit of account, there is no issue whatsoever.\n\nThis is a feature to replace price tags on items. Items would just be offered on the platform without public price tags!! The reason is that trade should be enabled by the subjective value assigned to items by the buyer, not the common \"market price\" normally used by the seller to price items. Because this leads to a higher trade volume, enabling trades that are blocked when stuff is offered for \"market prices\".\n\nThe inspiration came from this: \"The first problem with money is the fact that a seller is forced to place a uniform price on a good. This means that some potential buyers will get away with paying significantly less than what the good is worth to them, and others will be turned away because the price is too high. Both the seller and buyer would be better off if the maximum number of possible trades went through. because each party gave a mix of goods and services acceptable to the other. Pamas develops an example involving four parties each interested in acquiring certain goods for other goods. If prices were set, none of the trades would go through, but with barter, he shows that all of them would be possible.\" [Donath-1, p.2]\n\nThis innovation does away with the idea of a public market price. Interestingly, this entails doing away with the classic economic idea of the \"law of supply and demand\" that is said to lead to the market price. Instead, demand is also always relative to ones own income, and this is covered by this new idea of \"private prices\". See: \"Current economic models are based on money both as the medium of exchange and as the measurement of value. Walrasian general equilibrium model is the main paradigm through which the various market phenomena are explained, the so called Law of Supply and Demand. This paradigm is facing increasing difficulties and solutions are being searched\" [<a href=\"https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/bitstream/handle/123456789/4905/isbn9789516035482.pdf?sequence=1\">source</a>, p. 9]\n\n", "created_at": "2014-01-08 14:57:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:17.348436", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1277, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [24675], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13475, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1349, "post_number": 14, "raw": "<b>The RCAAQ network</b>\n\nThe <span><span>network</span> <span>formed by the</span>artist-run <span>centers</span> <span>of Quebec </span><span>artists (RCAAQ) is probably the</span> <span>best organized and</span> <span>strongest in the world</span> <span>(with their</span> <span>colleagues from Canada</span><span>).

The product is an off-grid electricitysystem for the unserved low-end part of the market. At a sales price of 50-70 USD, it will provide lighting, phone charging and operating a TV or computer. It can be so cheap because it does not include an inverter \u2013 it is not needed because essential electrical devices (LED lighting, computer, phone chargers) work with 12 V DC directly or via a DC-DC converter. The kit needs a small small photovoltaics plant to function in villages without electrical grid.\n\nIt would be made out of:\n\n* a discarded 12 V lead-acid car battery; it may not have the current carrying capability needed to jumpstart a car (needs ca. 1000-2000 W), but can still be fully sufficient for lower-power consumers (we need ca. 50 W)\n\n* a solar charge controller\n\n* 3 LED bulbs for lighting, 12 V DC, 3-4 W each\n\n* an adjustable DC-DC converter with various tips, able to power a notebook or a LCD TV screen (only TV models that come with their own external AC adapter though, since that can be replaced with our DC-DC adapter)\n\n* wires and switches\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--2\">(2) Neighborhood composting and biogas businesses</h4>\n\nThe concept of backyard composting is well-known around cities in Nepal and was practiced by many until getting used to urban trash collection. Currently, the idea is a hard sell (even though organizations provide ready-made vermicomposting bins for cheap) since people see little reason to get back to this.\n\nHowever, composting could work as a business idea by operating it as a neighborhood-scale plant. Then, it can even be combined with anaerobic biodigestion as a first step, producing biogas cooking fuel. This might be better adapted for an urban setting than expecting everyone to add biodigesters to their roof for producing their own biogas. A compact, odor-proof plant design is needed that can work in a neighborhood-level plant, producing both biogas for the neighborhood and fertile soil for the local area, both of which can be sold.\n\nInterestingly, even all kinds of paper (esp. cardboard and newspaper) are suitable for composting ([see](https://www.planetnatural.com/composting-paper/)). And the paper types not suitable for direct composting can be converted to biochar as soil amendment. (By converting to ash, it should also be simple enough to measure potential heavy metal content, which is basically the only possible residual contaminant after charring.)\n\nThe biogas would be delivered in regular LPG cylinders at 20 bars (well within the ratings of these cylinders). One such biogas cylinder lasts about one day, so when getting a delivery of 3 cylinders twice a week it could be acceptable, esp. since the distance to the production site would only be a few hundred meters. It's not that comfortable, but not much more uncomfortable than needing a 20 l drinking water container every second day.\n\nThis way, home delivered CNG cylinders in LPG cylinder dimensions become a nice drop-in replacement for using LPG for cooking. This way, even a landlocked country without own fossil fuel supplies can easily become independent from foreign LPG supplies.\n\nBusiness model: in exchange for separating and contributing kitchen scraps, people would get the biogas fuel at a discounted rate (say, 700 NPR per month for a family, which is about half the normal LPG costs). In addition, compost is sold to local gardeners and in truckloads to farms around the city.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--3\">(3) Novel products from plastic trash</h4>\n\nNearly all plastic trash is currently landfilled in Kathmandu (and probably in all other cities in Nepal), but there are quite some ways to use it as a raw material in small businesses. The [Precious Plastic](http://preciousplastic.com/) project provides several tested designs for open source machines to build by oneself for manufacturing products from recycled plastics in small workshops. Product ideas include:\n\n* **Road topping, construction and flooring blocks made from gravel and scrap plastic:** The technique was developed by Prof. R. Vasudevan in India and is called \u201cplastone\u201d, see here. Among other things, this is great material for covering roads to villages, since laying it and repairing it does not require heavy / specialized machinery. Road pavement blocks would ideally be interlocking. These blocks can be produced from unsorted, mixed trash plastic trash. For a company doing that already (with a mixture of 60% mixed plastics and 40% sand), including videos about their processes, see [NELPLAST Ghana Ltd.](https://www.nelplastgh.com/).\n\n* **Waterproof cover material:** When poured hot on-site rather than into blocks, the \"plastone\" material referred to above can be used as waterproof material for covering foundations, as protective wall plastering (needs a way to apply it hot on vertical surfaces of course), and as replacement for blacktopping roads.\n\n* **Upcycling PET plastic bottles:** For example, they could be made into transparent rooftiles for greenhouses (or like here). In rural areas, windows and roofs for houses can also be made from this. Also, there are nice simple inventions to make rope from PET bottles, like here. Similarly, wider stripes of PET bottles can be woven into baskets etc.. Machine designs and processes should be put into DIY manuals.\n\n* **Injection molding from scrap plastic:** By sorting plastic by kind (and optionally color) and making plastic granule from it, one has the raw material for DIY injection molding. There are several designs for DIY injection molding machines, the challenge is usually creating the molds. However, the artisan metal casters in Patan can help to create the two halves of the negative form. Either they would model the halves in wax first and cast them with their usual lost wax technique separately, or (much simpler) they can simply create the intended plastic object in clay, dry it, then dip it into a pot of liquid aluminium and cut the cooled-down metal block in half to get the two halves of the mold. Then, people can produce many kinds of (simple at first) plastic items in a small shop. Like containers, furniture parts, and large corrugated plastic sheets to use for roofing in villages instead of zinc sheets. A DIY plastic casting industry seems like an interesting thing to research the processes and tech for. For example, for sorting the plastic, low-tech ways to identify them fast and reliably have to be found.\n\n* **Plastic boxes from scrap plastic:** They would be made from 2-3 mm sheet material made from scrap plastic, and combined with stacking corners and edge elements made from plastic by injection molding, or from aluminium by metal casting. For cost reduction, re-usable aluminium molds made from steel or ceramics would be used. These boxes would be superior to the ones currently made from thin zinc-coated steel sheets (as used for roofing but flat) in some workshops in Kathmandu. A major application would be rooftop boxes on jeeps and buses for carrying loads.\n\n* **Plastic shingles for roofing and wall covering:** These would be used for roofing and wall covering, and made from plastic sheet material in sizes of ca. 20\u00d730 cm. In contrast to the usual large plastic sheets used for roofs and walls, these are much simpler to DIY produce from scrap plastic. When made from transparent plastic like PET bottles, the shingles are also good for light inlets (not windows for living areas of course) and for greenhouses.\n\n* **Blocks from scrap plastic:** Solid plastic block are a great raw material for further products, since they are sturdy, weather-proof and simple to machine. Any woodworking tool, an improvised lathe, or a simple DIY CNC mill will do. There are multiple how-tos for making plastic blocks from scrap plastic at home (like here and here), and such a process would have to be upscaled to a small business setting. Then one small company could collect, clean and sort the plastic trash, another one would buy it and make plastic blocks, and others would buy the blocks to produce things.\n\n* **3D printing workshop using scrap plastic:** While industrial injection molding needs quite some effort and production volume because of the required molds, 3D printers can  produce small quantities economically and can likewise use scrap plastic. This can be imagined as a business idea: a workshop with 10 or more open source 3D printers (like the RepRap series), printing parts for customers all day, plus an open source filament extruder like [Recyclebot](https://www.appropedia.org/Recyclebot_v2.3) that produces the required filament from scrap plastic.\n\n* **Making wall insulation material from scrap plastic:** Insulation will reduce heating fuel needs \u2013 relevant for Kathmandu Valley, but more so in the higher-up hilly area. Insulation material from scrap plastic is simply thin fibers extruded from heated plastic and formed into wooly panels, similar to rockwool / glass wool panels.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--4\">(4) Rooftop farming</h4>\n\nThis could be big in Kathmandu, since rooftops are unused space for most of the day. They provide plenty of sunlight, water in a water tank, a waterproof clean strong floor, and usually access with an outside staircase. The plants would even make the rooftop more beautiful, cool it in the summer, and thus also make the city greener and cooler when this idea would spread. The \u201clandless urban farmers\u201d would rent access to multiple rooftops in the same city area, and visit them regularly to grow things there, using high-yield urban farming techniques. A similar \u201cdistributed urban farm\u201d concept in Canada is demonstrated <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adW3GCQGHug\">here</a>. Another set of small businesses would provide equipment for this, including soil (from backyard composting), waterproof planting boxes (welded from plastic sheets made from trash plastic), supports (from scrap wood, for raised bed gardening), and drip irrigation equipment.\n\nInterestingly, some effort is already put into this by the city administration in Kathmandu ([see](http://www.cityfarmer.info/2016/08/05/rooftop-farming-on-rise-in-kathmandu/)).\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--5\">(5) Neighborhood \u201ctotal recycling\u201d sites</h4>\n\nTrash is quite a DIY resource and can be recycled to over 95% with DIY techniques on small scales. Would also work in Kathmandu: here, solid waste is 63% organic, 11% plastic, 9% paper, 5% glass, 12% other [<a href=\"http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2014-07-12/kmc-is-largest-waste-generator.html\">source</a>]. The organic part would be converted to biogas and compost in the household or a neighborhood-level plant, which is the most DIY part. Leaves about 36% for collection. Trash should not be concentrated too much for processing it \u2013 too much in one spot means bad smells and health hazards. Proposal: a neighborhood-level site that fine-sorts and safely recycles the remaining 36% of waste, also being a business opportunity. Users would get special cans to separate the trash in the household (since trash sorting is the worst work ever when done later). Products of the recycling plant would be plastic granule, salvaged half-finished products from metal, aluminium shreds and ingots (e.g. for aluminium casting in Patan), steel pieces for recycling, paper shreds to go to paper recycling plants, and glass, to also go to recycling. Since waste management in Kathmandu is still largely done by private companies, it should be possible to be another one of these companies, providing waste disposal to households for much cheaper fees than the others due to converting it to resources. For a great example of community-driven full recycling, see Japan\u2019s Kamikatsu city [<a href=\"http://www.fastcoexist.com/3055254\">source</a>].\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--6\">(6) DIY washing machine and detergents</h4>\n\nSeems many poorer people wash by hand in Kathmandu. Also, when using photovoltaics off-grid electricity, one cannot operate a household washing machine. But there are alternatives, incl. cheaper DIY recipes for the detergents. My colleague Natalia mentions for example that soap nuts are produced in Nepal - it's a great natural detergent, and it seems not in widespread use at least in the urban areas.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--7\">(7) DIY low-energy fridge</h4>\n\nUninterrupted cold storage is a problem even in houses with backup electricity, since the inverter is often not powerful enough for starting a compressor fridge. This fridge should work with an off-grid photovoltaics setup, use extremely little energy, and be cheap and DIY. Something like the Australian evaporation coolers maybe?\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--8\">(8) DIY recirculating shower</h4>\n\nA major way to save energy and water. There is <a href=\"http://www.instructables.com/id/Showerloop/\">Showerloop</a> as an open source design, and it should be possible to modify it to 20% the cost (ca. 120 USD then) or less.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--9\">(9) Lead-acid battery recycling</h4>\n\nRecycling automotive and grid-backup lead-acid batteries is possible in a DIY process. It can include (1) use of special substances (like EDTA) that can revitalize nearly worn-down batteries, (2) making new batteries from working cells of broken ones, (3) exchanging or even recasting the lead plates to repair cells. The products will be well usable as photovoltaics batteries, while cars and trucks should better get new ones. But since lead is toxic and the acid is not harmless either, this is a bit difficult to do in a safe way. Probably not done in Nepal at the moment (?) since the techniques are not well-known, so it offers a business opportunity for small-scale manufacturing.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--10\">(10) Innovative basketry</h4>\n\nBasketry is practiced a lot in Nepal, esp. the countryside. There are probably some innovative ideas, materials and techniques to do still more with it and make it a more \u201ccompetitive\u201d technique for the use in cities. For example, using 3-4 mm plastic filament as raw material, made from plastic trash using an open source filament extruderlike the [Recyclebot](https://www.appropedia.org/Recyclebot_v2.3). (There is also [Filabot](https://www.filabot.com/), which started as an open source design but may not be one anymore.)\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--11\">(11) Producing e-bicycles with with salvaged LiIon batteries</h4>\n\nElectric bicycles are rarely seen in Nepal so far, and there is a business opportunity for small manufacturing by upgrading normal bicycles into e-bicycles.\n\nThe most expensive part is usually the accumulator, but one can collect and utilize broken-down notebook accumulators for this. They are usually available for free and &gt;80% of their LiIon cells are still useful, although often with only 30% their energy capacity and current carrying capacity remaining. This however simply means a 3 times heavier accumulator, which is still acceptable for Li-Ion technology. Also, by charging these batteries to only 3.92 V (70% their capacity), they can last for 3000-5000 cycles rather than 300-500, making them about 8 times cheaper again (per Watt hour delivered).\n\nAlternatively, one can import overstock LiIon 18650 cell batteries, which are available for 0.081 EUR/Wh, see for example [this project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjr2LKmhdVw). The cost of a 500 Wh accu pack will be around 40 EUR then, or (say) 70 EUR incl. all casing, soldering etc..\n\nIn addition, one would make these battery packs swapable, and build PV powered recharge stations on the way where one can simply swap the battery pack for a fresh one. Together, this will allow going nearly twice as fast by bicycle uphill and downhill as by truck or bus (which is around 10 km/h off-road, as per experience values). Still, the \"fuel\" is DIY produced in PV arrays. In addition, in villages the bicycle battery packs would also be used as backup battery during the night, to power lights and computers when PV power is not available. A 500 Wh accu pack is fully sufficient for a family, as it would power a notebook for 50 hours for example.\n\nNote that handling unprotected LiIon battery cells while manufacturing the battery packs is potentially dangerous, as it can cause fires. Also, you have to use proper protection circuits when creating battery packs from these, to prevent fires during use. All of this is manageable however, and you can collect the relevant knowledge on the Internet.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--12\">(12) Producing cargo bicycles</h4>\n\nCreating one\u2019s own DIY cargo bicycle, to work better and faster than the three-wheeled ones seen around Kathmandu. They can also be produced with electrical propulsion with minimal costs of ownership for the batteries (see the point about producing e-bicycles for that).\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--13\">(13) Producing electric tempos</h4>\n\nThere once were 600 electrical SAFA tempos in Kathmandu, but operating them is difficult because battery depreciation costs about 100 USD/month, nearly as much as wage and electricity costs combined [<a href=\"http://www.energyhimalaya.com/energy-efficiency/transportation.html\">source</a>]. However, battery costs can be nearly eliminated by replacing the 36 deep-cycle lead-acid cells with a 21s Li-Ion configuration, made from used Li-Ion cells from notebooks and  powertools. They would be charged to just 70% capacity (3.92 V/cell instead of 4.2 V/cell), which dramatically increases their cycle life from 300-600 to 1000-2000, giving the battery a 5 times higher lifetime energy throughput than lead-acid. Given that 18650 Li-Ion cells from broken notebook batteries have on average 3 Wh/cell left (at 4.2 V/cell) and that just 1.7 Wh/cell are required for the same energy density as lead-acid batteries (which is 36 Wh/kg at 60% depth-of-discharge), a battery the same weight as the original lead-acid battery pack and charged to 3.92 V can carry the same energy. By selecting cells with at least 4 Wh/cell (also easily possible), a 70% charge leads to 2.8 Wh/cell, which is a 50% range increase over lead acid given the same battery weight. So about 120 km/charge when assuming the data from SAFA tempos referred above. Moreover, investment costs are further decreased by needing only one battery pack rather than two as for SAFA tempos \u2013 Li-Ion batteries can be charged in about one hour to 70% rather than taking 12-16 hours as for lead-acid batteries.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--14\">(14) Glass handicrafts</h4>\n\nSimple to do, even in remote areas, using a hydrogen flame (from PV powered electrolysis) or gasoline flame (as used by goldsmiths, with a simple \u201cbubbling device\u201d for gasification). Allows recycling of glass waste. Instructions have to include Innovative, proven designs for glass products. For example, plates, cups, bowls and other tableware. And flat lids for canning, using collected glass jars and either a rubber ring or wax seal.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--15\">(15) Glass brick and glass shingle making</h4>\n\nThis transforms glass waste into useful raw materials for buildings. Both would be useful to build greenhouses, and these greenhouses would last much longer than polytunnel and plastic roof versions, which quickly degrade from UV radiation.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--16\">(16) Water filter factory</h4>\n\nInstruction how to make ceramic water filters with local materials (clay, rice husk and water) are found <a href=\"http://rdic.org/ceramic-water-filters/\">here</a> and [here](http://pottersforpeace.org/?page_id=63). These allow to make water truck water and rainwater well drinkable \u2013 not possible with just chlorine / iodine due to algae and other dirt particles.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--17\">(17) Producing separating dry toilets</h4>\n\nVery DIY, and it means no blackwater sewage is generated by the household. Only relevant for urban (and of course rural) informal settlements, which are not connected to the sewage network at all. Everyone whose house is connected (which are basically all houses in managed / residential areas in Kathmandu valley) is not interested in an off-grid toilet, since there do not seem to be recurring charges for wastewater disposal.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--18\">(18) Erasable notebooks for schools kids</h4>\n\nCosts for notebooks and pencils is a major cost parents have to bear for the education of their children, and often cannot. Creating notebooks from plastic film \u201cpaper\u201d (like Tyvek) and pens with ethanol-based ink allows erasing them after writing by wiping with ethanol. It would pay off in a month.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--19\">(19) Flow Hive beekeeping</h4>\n\nSee <a href=\"http://www.honeyflow.com/\">honeyflow.com</a> for the Flow Hive, a \u201crevoluntionary\u201d beehive that needs no centrifuges or other expensive and complex equipment for beekeeping.\n\nOn Alibaba, <a href=\"https://www.alibaba.com/trade/search?fsb=y&amp;IndexArea=product_en&amp;CatId=&amp;SearchText=flow+hive\">you can find</a> many cheap Chinese imitations of the original FlowHive device \u2013 for prices that are reasonable for Nepali beekeepers!\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--20\">(20) Fruit walls on existing terraces</h4>\n\nThe vertical walls along terraced land are currently not used for anything, but they are great as heat-retention \u201cfruit walls\u201d to grow fruit trees even where it would normally be too cold for them. <a href=\"http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2015/12/fruit-walls-urban-farming.html\">See here</a> how that concept was applied in Europe for hundreds of years.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--21\">(21) Fruit wall mountains</h4>\n\nNepal has many barren mountains where nothing is grown due to lack of soil and cold temperatures. However, they can be transformed into \u201cfruit wall mountains\u201d. Many of them are probably in protected areas though, where this would not be applicable. <a href=\"http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2015/12/fruit-walls-urban-farming.html\">See here</a> how the concept of fruit walls was applied in Europe for hundreds of years.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--22\">(22) Bicycle powered grain mill</h4>\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--23\">(23) Earth brick boxes from recycled plastic</h4>\n\nSmall companies in urban centers would create stackable plastic boxes from trash plastic that are then filled with earth and stones and used as \"earth bricks\" for building houses in the villages. The filling can be the same material as with earth bag buildings, the container is just just more durable and more earthquake proof. Similarly to building with earthbags, these blocks must be able to settle over two years after being used in a building. For that, it is enough if they can telescope down into the next lower layer of boxes, with special Lego-style connectors to make interlocking layers still possible. Optionally, one can use two rebars running vertically through each block, or lashing strap loops compressing a wall from top to bottom. Blocks should let water run off at the outside rather than letting it run into the box.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--24\">(24) Earthquake-safe buildings from blocks of recycled plastic</h4>\n\nThe system was developed by Conceptos Plasticos in Columbia, co-founded by Oscar Andres Mendez Gerardino in or before 2009. It consists of interlocking, extruded blocks of plastic and slotted extruded beams of plastic. All plastic comes from recycling plastic waste, and can be mixed plastic of various sorts. Information:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><a href=\"*%20%20https://www.unilever.com/sustainable-living/join-in/Young-Entrepreneur-Awards-2016/Oscar-Andres-Mendez-Gerardino/\">project description on the Unilever award page</a></li>\n\n<li>YouTube videos: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSOh21ooM_E\">one</a>,  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uu0pNCkSNNc\">two</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHSZvTJVlRs\">three</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx6Y1pNhUkg\">four</a>.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nTo improve the system, one could mix gravel and / or sand into the plastic as a filler material, increasing the amount of blocks produced from the same amount of plastic by probably a factor of 3-4. To further improve the system, blocks can be CNC milled out of extruded cuboid blocks. This allows to build anything with this system in a Lego-like system, including complex shapes like vaults.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--25\">(25) Plastic water tube from trash plastic</h4>\n\nRather than importing it, producing water tube is simple to do with domestic means and properly sorted and cleaned trash plastic.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--26\">(26) Plastic particle board</h4>\n\nA simple way of recycling plastic into something useful, by just melting and pressing finely ground plastic waste together between heated steel plates into a particle board. It would not be a massive plastic sheet, but have many small air cavities, but that is intentional. The product would still be a great building material for furniture, boxes etc..\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--27\">(27) Bamboo reinforced plastic</h4>\n\nBamboo has long straight fibers that can be easily extracted (e.g. from trash pieces). So by interlaying plastic film layers (e.g. from trashed plastic bags) and bamboo fibers, with the fibers turned 90\u00b0 against the direction in the layer below, one can create very sturdy sheet material, much more sturdy than if just using the plastic from the plastic bags. At the same time, the material will be light (lighter than massive plastic sheets) and resistant to rot, unlike bamboo itself.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--28\">(28) Add-on electrostatic air particle filter for trucks</h4>\n\nFast option for better air quality in Nepal: Every large truck coming into the city will get a high voltage based air particle filter mounted to the exhaust, and will have to hand it back when leaving the city.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--29\">(29) Mobile trash recycling unit</h4>\n\nA 20 ft ISO container with equipment and workplaces to sort all kinds of trash, for proper reuse and recycling. The unit would be put on a trash dump site, a wheeled loader would put in trash in one end, and sorting results will be dumped into various heaps and smaller containers around the ISO container. Results will be \"for reuse\", \"for reuse in parts\", various materials for reuse as raw materials (aluminium, steel, different plastics, copper, stones, glas), and organics to use for methane generation and composting. Sorted goods will then be cleaned and sold to manufacturers and scrap yards. The advantage is that this container will offer safe workplaces, compared to poking around in the trash as done currently. People will be completely isolated from the trash through climatized manipulator-like suits for the upper third of the body, accessible from the \"trash-free\" area below the surface to which they are mounted.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--30\">(30) Smog-filtering device that produces bricks</h4>\n\nSmog-cleaning device that collects the smog dust and creates bricks from it. This is meant for massive-scale outdoor air cleaning. A device for this purpose has been developed in the Netherlands, see http://inhabitat.com/worlds-largest-smog-sucking-vacuum-cleaner-could-rid-cities-of-pollution/ . The additional idea is now to use the dust and burn it like bricks (possibly in a solar furnace). This will cause the dust particles to sinter together, just like clay. In this shape, they can be used as normal building material. It's like getting bricks delivered over the air :-) This will be especially useful in cities with horrible air quality that also includes coarse dust, for example Kathmandu.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--31\">(31) Street-sweeping cargo bicycle</h4>\n\nKathmandu now has street sweeping broomer machines, but they cannot reach the small and narrow roads. For these, a cargo bicycle with electrical assistance (or a second person powerin the rotating broom) would be a good option.\n\nThe dust can perhaps be washed and then used as soil in agriculture. Because that is what it has been before being carried away by wind erosion.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--32\">(32) Biogas operated fridges</h4>\n\nBiogas operated fridges for villages in Nepal. That's very simple, just use the LPG operated camping fridges for that. They can be built from cheap used components (small broken camping fridges, insulation material). By using very thick walls (not a problem in villages as there is a lot of space), one can create very energy efficient fridges. Ideally, natural materials would be used for the walls. See for how to do it: https://energypedia.info/wiki/Biogas_Appliances#Refrigerators . An obvious improvement is power / cold / heat co-production: use the exhaust heat of a generator-driving combustion engine to drive the biogas fridge.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--33\">(33) Logistics platform</h4>\n\nBoth for ordering shipments within a city (like Kathmandu) and for national and international shipments. Incl. co-shipment and automatic logistical optimization.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--34\">(34) Autonomous electric footpath vehicles</h4>\n\nSee my [dedicated article](/t/id/8781).\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--35\">(35) Sky Bikes</h4>\n\nThese are enclosed, muscle powered cable cars running on aerial ropeways.\n\nThey work by having two cables: one cable between hilltops, keeping up a horizontal second cable that runs 20-50 m lower and is connected by vertical cables to the top one every 10 m or so. Alternatively, the lower cable would be replaced by an aluminium square profile with a slot opening in the bottom, with rollers inside. It is more expensive, but makes the mechanism of connecting the sky bike much simpler and more secure. In both cases, no pulling cable, electrical motor etc. is needed, as it's all horizontal and thus very fast and easy to travel on that cable. Especially the aluminium profile version would provide a very smooth, horizontal ride.\n\nThe challenge is of course when using two cables, how to construct the system that suspends the sky bike from the steel cable above it, given that there are vertical cables in the way of driving forward, and that every 10 m. One idea is to have multiple (4-7) pulleys on top of the sky bike, with a special mechanism that allows to split them in the middle on demand, to pass a vertical cable. Another mechanism ensures that only one can be split / opened at any time, preventing the sky bike from falling down. The splitting surface would be toothed and its outside grooved, so that there is no realistic chance of accidental opening when closed, even when all closing force is missing. As an additional security mechanism, each sky bike would pull two ropes with special triple carabiner hooks behind them which can pass the vertical cables in a similar manner: only one carabiner can open at any given time.\n\nThe cable construction can be a loop so that the bikes can travel a full round trip, with some in store at each of the two end stations. It would even be possible to route these ways alongside hills (suspended on posts). Combining these two approaches, 10-30 km long \"bike highways\" can be built in the countryside that connect the village to the nearest road very fast. It would also be possible for these cable cars to carry load suspended below them (up to say, 600 kg total mass of the cable car, including the car, two people and the load).\n\nIt is also possible to extend this idea to be a network of skybike routes where the driver is able to choose his own way. This would use two pairs of hooks to connect to the cable. Two hooking from the left side, two from the right side. It has to be possible to switch the set automatically while driving. With the hooks from the left side, one will go left at a Y junction, with the ones from the right side, one will go right.\n\nAnother option for improvement are gas balloons, carrying most or all of the weight. This allows to use more lightweight steel cables, used just to pull the balloons, not to carry weight or secure against falling down. The advantage is that this allows mass use of blimp-based logistics, since the wind sensitivity, ground handling etc. problems are all solved then. But to make it usable for everyone, several changes have to be made. The cables should be installed permanently, with hubs on 10 m towers on hilltops. Because without rolling and unrolling the cables, they will last much longer. The cables would be used to conduct electricity, and the cable cars would have electrical motors and pull themselves along the cable. There would only be one cable between two points, so travelling is not horizontal. Changing direction by choosing a different cable can only happen at hub points. Possibly, a lightweight aramide cable inside an aluminium profile with a toothed outside (for the balloon to draw itself along) would be the best combination of cable weight, UV resistance, abrasion resistance and conductivity. It will be possible to use cheap hydrogen clusterballoons by letting them always float 30 m above the load (also great for avoiding ground contact with trees etc.). The load would travel in the cable car which is hanging below the cable. This will also allow to lower the load to the ground at any point during the journey.\n\nFor an independently developed, simpler version of this concept that is still applicable as a tourist attraction, see the video about [Sky Bikes at Cascadas de Micos, Mexico](https://youtu.be/QxBhc53yhQA?t=166). For another example that also includes turns and intermediate supports in the path of travel, see [Zip-Bike Xel-H\u00e1](https://www.xelha.com/zip-bike-xelha-park.php) ([more videos here](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=zip+bike+xel+ha)).\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--36\">(36) Airdrops with guided parachutes for shipping to remote villages</h4>\n\nThe idea is using airdrops with guided parachutes of emergency supplies, urgent medical supplies and as a normal parcel logistics system for remote villages in Nepal. Of course, the same system can be used in to service any remote area worldwide.\n\nAn airplane on its regular route would drop self guided parachutes with load from them, which will find their way to the landing locations in the villages. This would allow to drop (say) 25 packages at 20 kg each (500 kg together, equiv. to 6 passengers) distributed over up to 25 villages within the flight path. For an example of a self guided parachute system for airdrops, see [Atair Onyx](http://www.atair.com/onyx/).\n\nFor this to work, every village would have to designate and fence in a landing zone, ideally at a mountaintop. The area should ideally be at least 100 \u00d7 100 m, but even 30 \u00d7 30 m should be sufficient when the system is mature. The area would have to get some optical beacons and (if night operation is envisaged) some photovoltaics powered LED beacons. The parachutes would use these beacons during the final approach. In addition, the area should have a soft surface. 50 cm of pine needles and small dry branches, kept dry on a foundation of gravel, will do the job for example. An automatic system (or a person called before on the phone) would ring some bells before an airdrop, so people in the area can leave for safety in time. The \"automatic system\" for this could be as simple as a GSM phone number with a GSM device and loudspeakers at the drop zone.\n\nOne or two systems of GPS guided parachutes are already in existence, developed for military applications. This however would have to be a system of much lower cost, for rural developing areas.\n\nThis system would be quite cheap to operate, as normal fixed-wing aircraft can be used, and they can drop the goods mid-air during normal passenger flights, not needing to fly close to the ground as with normal airdrops. It could beat all alternatives (helicopter landings, drone delivery) by an order of magnitude. Note that normal airdrops are currently not an option at all in steep mountainous terrain, due to the lack of precision.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--37\">(37) Carry balloons</h4>\n\nThese are hydrogen balloons, probably cluster balloons for simple and safe handling, that are attached to ones backpack or other load, or even to pack animals. It would have enough lift to make carrying easier resp. to allow carrying more if one likes. At the same time, the baloon must be small enough to allow safe handling in slight winds. So probably, a 40 m\u00b3 balloon for 30-40 kg lift.\n\nIt is not clear yet how and where these would best be used. Of course, using this is only possible on open terrain, not in the woods etc.. Maybe they would be used mostly for long-distance carrying to supply villages etc., but that will eventually be taken over by other means of transport because it also uses too much human time \u2013 except perhaps in combination with caravans of pack animals. Another use would be in agriculture in mountainous regions, for carrying tools, harvest, soil, compost etc. to and from the fields. Wheelbarrows do not work well in this terrain (too steep, too muddy), but carry balloons could.\n\nThe hydrogen would be created locally by water electrolysis, using excess photovoltaics energy.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--38\">(38) Chain bridges with pedal power</h4>\n\n[Wire bridges](http://villagetechsolutions.org/transportation.html) are an interesting existing technology in Nepal. They could be improved by using chains instead of steel cables (more durable, less likely to be damaged, and allowing traction) and bicycle pedals in the cable cars for pushing the car across, with gears getting traction from the overhead chain.\n\nMore details about this solution are found in our project \"[Crossing rivers without bridges](/t/7123)\".\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--39\">(39) Small wind turbines</h4>\n\nWind is readily available in many villages in Nepal and a government supported renewable energy source in Nepal ([see](http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2016-01-06/25-kw-wind-solar-hybrid-energy-project-redefining-bhorleni.html)).\n\nHowever, as can be seen from the linked article, the installation of commercial wind turbines is quite expensive even in Nepal. If it woud be just (say) 25% the financial cost (and more community labor), many more villages could install wind turbines. About 25% of the cost was what the villagers in the linked story contributed financially, the rest had to come from third parties.\n\nFor an organization that is already active in this field of small, DIY friendly wind turbines, see [the work of KAPEG](https://online.kapeg.com.np/small-wind-turbine-system).\n\nAn interesting product idea in this context would be to create small wind turbines that are optimized to be carried in parts to remote villages. This is especially meant for Nepal's trans-Himalayan areas like Dolpo. They have a lot of wind, but turbines would have to be carried up there in parts. A durable, cheap, open design for this would help a lot.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--40\">(40) Slow-but-cheap international parcel service</h4>\n\nA \"slow parcel\" service that combines parcels into LCL (\"less than container load\") shipments from Nepal to Europe and the other way. With forwarding within Nepal / within Europe by appropriate means. This would be great to have for \"very small businesses\" to import and export.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--41\">(41) Using biogas as vehicle fuel</h4>\n\nNepal's government is already favourable towards becoming more fuel independent from India, so might welcome this idea\n\nThis would start with building normal small biogas plants, as present in villages in Nepal already. Optionally, one can convert the contained carbon dioxide in biogas to methane to ramp up the energy content, by inserting hydrogen into the digestion process and letting the bacteria do their work (hydrogen would be created by electrolysis, using excess photovoltaics energy). The produced biogas has to be cleaned from the corrosive hydrogen sulfide gas (bacteria can help).\n\nNow this biogas can be used in converted vehicles. It is not too difficult to convert even petrol driven cars to biogas. This has been routinely done by small manufacturers in Europe. One will need to import the storage gas bottles (can be normal 200-300 bar high-pressure gas bottles) and esp. the compressor to fill them, however.\n\nInitially, there will not be a network of refueling stations in the country for this, so it makes sense to at first focus on vehicles that drive around a local area only: taxis and delivery vehicles in cities. Methane fuels create very little air pollution, so this is a suitable fuel for use in cities (esp. Kathmandu) anyway.\n\nA proposal for a distribution system (for use with motorcycles and home appliances) would be gas cylinders in the format of LPG cylinders, since then the existing distribution infrastructure for LPG cylinders can also be used for CNG distribution. This way, a few centralized production and compression sites are enough, and distribution is safer than by pipelines or using large tanks. This way, one can refill at home by having spare cylinders there, without needing an own compression station and natural gas connection (or production site), which surely not everyone will have in developing areas. This distributed refueling at homes makes CNG motorbikes a viable business model even at the start, where the distribution infrastructure will be only starting up, with very few refueling stations not close to home. They would home-deliver the CNG cylinders instead.\n\n**Motorcycle range with high-pressure tanks.** For using biogas in special high-pressure CNG cylinders (of the same size as current LPG cylinders) as a motorcycle fuel, here is a calculations of the achievable range:\n\n  &nbsp; LPG cylinders come in various sizes based on a standardized 305 mm (12\") diameter and varying length ([see](http://www.hexagonragasco.com/products/technical-specifications)). The 15.4 kg LPG content cylinder, as used in Kathmandu, is approximately 715 - 735 mm high ([see](http://tinyurl.com/p5jufxb)). Since propane and butane have different densities, the actual LPG mass content depends on the mixture ([see](http://www.hexagonragasco.com/products/technical-specifications)). A 305 x 715 mm (D x l) 33.5 l cylinder would weigh ca. 22 kg filled with LPG ([see](http://www.hexagonragasco.com/products/technical-specifications)).\n\n  &nbsp; The standard diameters for CNG cylinders are different: 232, 267, 316, 325, 356, 406 mm ([see](http://www.sahuwalagroup.com/cng-cylinders.htm)). So one should choose the 267 mm diameter one and add some protective cover against damages, which is needed for composite cylinders. A 30 l CNG cylinder with dimensions 267 x 725 mm mm (D x l) would weigh 36 kg made from steel. A fiber-reinforced Type 2 CNG tank cylinder is 20-40% lighter than a pure steel one ([see](http://www.cng-tank.com/)), we assume here it is 33% lighter, 24 kg in this case. With its 7.46 m\u00b3 of biogas weighing ~0.8 kg/m\u00b3 * 7.46 m\u00b3 = ~6 kg, it would weigh ca. 30 kg. Compared to a 22 kg LPG cylinder, this is acceptable for handling, and should be acceptable for a motorbike (for sure when riding it alone). The energy content is equivalent to 8.21 l of gasoline ([see](http://www.sahuwalagroup.com/cng-cylinders.htm)). A good rate for gasoline motor bikes is 3.0 l/100 km (for example the Kawasaki GPZ305, [see](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawasaki_GPZ305)). So the range would be 275 km, which is not great but acceptable, and for sure acceptable in city areas.\n\n**Motorcycle range with low-pressure tanks.** This is also possible, but does not yield much range even with motorcycles. It would be done by compressing the biogas with a fridge compressor (which can create up to 40 bars, [see](http://hackaday.com/2013/09/17/high-pressure-air-compressor-using-a-pair-of-refrigeration-compressors/)) and storing it in LPG bottles, which can hold 18-20 bars safely ([see](http://usersites.horrorfind.com/home/halloween/wolfstone/HalloweenTech/pnupro_PropaneAirTank.html)). Now one 15 kg LPG bottle has 30 l volume ([see](https://www.elgas.com.au/for-business/forklift-gas-bottles-cylinders/forklift-gas-bottle-cylinder-sizes-dimensions-capacities)). Which means that at 20 bars, it can store 600 l biogas, or about 0.5 kg (if all is methane). A motorcycle can carry two such bottles (one left, one right). At 4 kg / 100 km, that 1 kg would last just 25 km. However that fuel is free, and there is a village every 25 km for sure in Nepal, and every village could have its bottle swap station. The fuel would be inserted as a co-fuel into the air intake, and when running out of biogas after 25 km, petrol from the normal tank would be used.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--42\">(42) Foot passenger tunnels made with a micro roadheader</h4>\n\nSmall tunnels through a hill can connect the two sides of a hill in the hilly area of Nepal. That dramatically shortens certain ways between settlements and between fields and settlements, as travelling through a level tunnel is fast and almost effortless. Also it's almost \"magical\" when a portal in your backyard directly connects you to a remote space. For some growing urban areas (Gorkha Municipality for example) it would be an interesting way to have a large and quiet private garden that will not be threatened by urbanization as it is on the other side of the hill, maybe 400-1000 m away through a tunnel.\n\nA [roadheader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadheader) is the most versatile dunnel digging machine currently in existence. They are used, among other things, for digging out underground homes in Coober Pedy, Australia (see [this article](http://radio-weblogs.com/0119080/stories/2003/05/30/galleryLivingDownUnder.html)). An open hardware, small, CNC controlled roadheader device seems quite doable.\n\nThe problem will probably be rather social issues with tunnels: they are dark and will be considered \"unsafe\" esp. for women and children. That can however be solved by letting people travel through the tunnel with a small carriage that can be locked from the inside. There would only be one carriage in the tunnel, going back and forth, and due to a mechanical system people cannot enter the tunnel except into the carriage when it is docked at either end.\n\nThe carriage would have about four seats and would be powered like a bicycle by the passengers. There would also be a hauling cable so that it can be pulled from one side to the other without passengers, using a similar pedal operated system on each end.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--43\">(43) Producing autospades for agriculture</h4>\n\nMore efficient than hoes, and not requiring a plough. Seemingly not introduced in Nepal yet. They can easily be produced domestically in a small welding / metalworking workshop from readily available metal pieces. There are several variants of these \"backsaver spades\", and the first step would be to select the most suitable one for Nepal:\n\n* autospade with a flat blade and a spring mechanism: demonstrated [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiXmIht5IHg) and offered for sale [here](http://www.backsavergardentools.co.uk/product/autospade/); the original Wolf Terrex autospade was a very similar design\n\n* double-fork style autospade, crumbling the soil between two sets of metal rods: demonstrated [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiXmIht5IHg)\n\n* Backsaver Twinn spade, another design seemingly for lighter digging tasks in the garden, demonstrated [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGt5Gct0AI)\n\n* and probably there are several more designs for ergonomic spades around\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--44\">(44) Producing bicycle powered machines for agriculture</h4>\n\nIf to be used on the field, they can be made light enough to transport up and down hills, in contrast to motorized machines (and electrical machines are excluded as there is no electricity in the field, and if there was, then not enough \u2026 ok except with generators).\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--45\">(45) Combined biogas fired / solar powered food dehydrator</h4>\n\nIt should save energy by letting a batch of air saturate in humidity before exchanging it, and by heating incoming air with exhaust air using and air-to-air heat exchanger. This device will allow to dry food in harvest time close before monsoon, where sun is usually scarcer.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--46\">(46) Hydraulic ram water pumps</h4>\n\nThere are many villages located on hills which have little potable water, all while there is a river 200-400 m downhill. But since they lack electricity and the finances to purchase pumps, this water is not economically reachable. However, the hydraulic ram provides a water-driven way to pump water up to 600 m uphill. It is 25%-92% efficient. See the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_ram\">Wikipedia article about the hydraulic ram</a>.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--47\">(47) Making terraces into passive solar greenhouses, for extended growing seasons</h4>\n\nPassive solar greenhouses, built by using south-facing terraces, reusing the terrace wall for heat storage during the day. See <a href=\"http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2015/12/reinventing-the-greenhouse.html\">this detailed article</a> for the concept.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--48\">(48) Bioethanol fuel for vehicles made with syngas fermentation in villages</h4>\n\nUse village-scale syngas-fermentation process plants to create bioethanol fuel from cellulose biomass. This process is esp. nice since it creates DIY biofuel that is simple and safe to handle and not environmentally detrimental if spilled. Also, its production uses the biomass waste in villages (which is a lot), so does not (have to) compete with food production. And since the only input to the fermentation stage is gas, there is no sludge or other difficult to handle output. In addition, the biomass can be stored for the winter where the heat from partial combustion in syngas production can be used for space heating and cooking (syngas production can be distributed, with small pipelines pumping it to a central fermenter; this also allows cooking due to higher temperatures, and it wastes no heat compared to a central gasifier and heat distribution via hot water pipes). In addition, the syngas can also be used to directly operate generators for local electricity generation (it would be a waste to go through the ethanol process for this; and again, waste heat can be used for space heating via CHP). Plus, one can do the ethanol distillation at no additional cost by doing it only in winter, using the gasification process waste heat and operating the distillation indoors in people's homes, since this automatically reuses all distillation process heat for space heating. So one would collect biomass throughout the year, building an excess of it in summer, where gasification is only done for electricity generation (and waste heat used for cooking). In winter, where waste heat is needed also for space heating (and distilling), more gasification is done to drive the ethanol process. The end product (ethanol) is well storable, so seasonal storage is not a problem. Also, this creates a work opportunity for the \"slow part\" of the agricultural year, and even an income opportunity in winter, by selling the bioethanol. Finally, by doing incomplete gasification, biochar is produced, which is a great fertilizer for soil (see \"terra preta\"). One of the most interesting aspects is that this process can be economical for DIY production in villages even if it is not economical on the global market or even for sale inside the country (yet). Because it uses excess capacity (unused time due to lack of jobs, unused biomass) in villages and results in avoiding to spend always-scarce money on fuel and fuel taxes.\n\nAmong the waste biomass in Nepali villages that can be used for this is: pine needles from pine forests; rice straw; cow dung; twigs; wood scraps; bamboo scraps; gras; human feces (safe disposal compared to sludge from biogas generation). In total, the process seems to integrate very well with life in Nepali villages, running fully on current excess / waste biomass while generating fuel for own consumption and sale to city dwellers.\n\nIt seems that this process is ready to be used (with future improvements coming through further research), judging from the following links:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\"<a href=\"http://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/5/12/5372/energies-05-05372.pdf\">Commercial Biomass Syngas Fermentation</a>\" (great paper, summarizing it all in detail)</li>\n\n<li>English Wikipedia: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulosic_ethanol#Gasification_process_.28thermochemical_approach.29\">Cellulosic Ethanol: Gasification process (thermochemical approach)</a>\n</li>\n\n<li>German Wikipedia: <a href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthesegas-Fermentation\">Synthesegas-Fermentation</a>\n</li>\n\n<li>German Wikipedia: <a href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium_ljungdahlii\">Clostridium ljungdahlii</a>\n</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/12/1/118\">http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/12/1/118</a></li>\n\n<li>Tirado-Acevedo, Oscar: \"<a href=\"http://repository.lib.ncsu.edu/ir/bitstream/1840.16/6500/1/etd.pdf\">Production of Bioethanol from Synthesis Gas Using Clostridium ljungdahlii as a Microbial Catalyst</a>\". That dissertation esp. says that the competing (all biological) process is inferior at this time: \"Fermentation  of  synthesis  gas  obtained  from  biomass has  proven  to  be  a  viable approach to produce biofuels.  This technology has higher product yields and lower energy input  than  lignocellulose  hydrolysis fermentation.\" (p. 123)</li>\n\n<li>Regarding efficiency of this process: \"Coskata\u2019s proprietary process extracts more energy from feedstocks than competitive production pathways. [\u2026 O]ur process can produce [\u2026] 100 gallons [378 l] of ethanol per dry ton of softwood.\" [<a href=\"http://www.coskata.com/process/index.asp?source=D5E7FB22-6034-405B-898B-58DE4651645D\">source</a>].</li>\n\n<li>\"<a href=\"https://books.google.de/books?id=sBXqLxH06lIC\">Transportation Biofuels: Novel Pathways for the Production of Ethanol, Biogas and Biodiesel</a>\"</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nFor a process design adapted to rural settings in developing areas, an initial proposal would be to avoid membrane bioreactors (due to expensive, high-maintenance membranes used to separate out a water/ethanol mix from the reactor to then obtain the ethanol by distillation and feed back the water). Instead, use immobilized cell reactors in batch mode (\"liquid batch, continuous gas\"). Use (say) ten batch vessels in parallel, with the syngas travelling first through the old batches (the bacteriae might still want to eat if offered concentrated food \u2026) and then through the new batches. The by-product acetic acid is inhibiting via its pH. It might have to be removed by adding base, causing the formation of solid acetate salts. An interesting option for increasing the ethanol yield is adding a acetate to ethanol two-step process afterwards (as discussed <a href=\"http://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/5/12/5372/energies-05-05372.pdf\">here</a>).\n\nIn total however, commercialization has not yet been achieved of syngas fermentation for ethanol production, as discussed <a href=\"http://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/5/12/5372/energies-05-05372.pdf\">here</a>. This means it will be better to start with first-generaton (sugarcane based) ethanol production, which is not a problem until it uses all currently unused land in rural Nepal. This will yield the DIY distillation technology, while employing biomass gasification for electricity production (CHP), space heating and cooking will yield the DIY gasification technology. Research into the missing link (the fermentation step) can then be done in parallel.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--49\">(49) Bioethanol as DIY biofuel made in villages</h4>\n\nThe best DIY fuel for vehicles in Nepal is definitely not biogas or syngas, but bioethanol and perhaps vegetable oils. Biogas is fine for cooking and electricity generation though. Villages already have the required tech for bioethanol, since they already produce roksi :laughing: Ethanol is much simpler to handle (high energy density in storage) and less dangerous (zero pressure during storage) and more or less a drop-in replacement for petrol. Villages have mostly motorbikes, and these can run on bioethanol. Buses and trucks will still need diesel (but that can be replaced with vegetable oil later). Also, ethanol can replace LPG for cooking in the cities easily (with gasification burners being readily abvailable). This creates greater fuel independence in Nepal (politically wanted) and at the same time creates an additional market for village products, increasing the economic viability of villages.\n\nThe challenge is to find plants that can be efficiently farmed manually on terraced farms, produce marketable food, and bioethanol from the sugary remains of food production. But when it all adds up, meaning farmers can make an attractive income from producing bio ethanol, the fields in villages will be all in use again, and people will not have to emigrate that much since they can earn enough at home.\n\nA tested and tried process would be sugarcane as energy crop, as extensively used in Brazil. Calculation of required area: In Brazil, current yields are 6000 l/ha of pure hydrous ethanol (E100), with 9000 l/ha targeted through further improvements. With lower tech but more manual labor for farming (usually increasing yield), 5000 l/ha seems possible. Assuming two trips per week to the next city (4 x 30 km) per family, at 3.75 l / 100 km in a motorbike, this would need 127 l/year of ethanol, per family. At 1000 people / 250 families for a typical village, this would need 31750 l, requiring 31750 l / 5000 l/ha = 6.35 ha of land, an area of 251 x 251 m. Or for each family, 63500 m\u00b2 / 250 families = 254 m\u00b2/family, or 16 x 16 m, or one 42 x 6 m stripe on a terrace. This is definitely doable. The mobility enabled by this is not \"great\", but useful. Public transport would of course be the normal mode of transportation, but a motorbike will enable more flexibility when buses don't go during monsoon season etc..\n\nIt is said that in the hilly area, there is only 0.05 ha (500 m\u00b2) per person of cultivated land. Of this, 63.5 m\u00b2 (13%) would be used for bioethanol production, which is quite a lot given that it competes with food crops. However, reportedly there is now land falling barren in villages, since in many villages so many laborers emigrated that none are left to farm the land. Attracting sugarcane production here is not a problem for food security, then. It can become one when people migrate back to villages since employment options improve due to biofuel production. So in total, it would be much better to produce biofuels that do not use up land.\n\nWhen using sugarcane, the residue can be used for biomass gasification (syngas production), for ethanol distillation (indoor, enabling waste heat reuse for space heating), for cooking and electricity production (with CHP for waste heat reuse). This way, sugarcane replaces firewood, avoiding detrimental effects on the local environment. Still, it used up some arable land, but as long as there is unused arable land (as now, and worsening), that is not a problem.\n\nAnother possible process could be using fruit trees (low maintenance \"edible forests\") to create fruit juice. Then create fruit bars, paper etc. from the pulp, ferment the fruit juice, and if needed keep it until the following year when there is enough sunshine again. Then distil the ethanol out using a solar powered distillation plant. Use low temperatures, as that should allow to also use the remainder as fruit juice again (?) or for other purposes of nutrition. Also, sugarcane is a reasonable plant to use.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--50\">(50) Small biogas driven generators for villages</h4>\n\nFor villages in Nepal that get enough sun year-round, photovoltaics is the preferable option to generate electricity for small appliances. However, for villages that may not get enough sun for more than 3 days in a row at a certain time of the year, it may be more cost effective to add a small biogas driven generator than to add a larger battery. Producing these generators is the business idea here. No such product exists on the market so far, which means that international sales are an option if this product is a commercial success. It is esp. suitable for Nepal, as there are thousands of household scale biogas plants in villages already, used to produce cooking gas.\n\nThis product would be a very small combination of an internal combustion engine and a generator, with (let's say) 100 W electrical output. This is way enough for electricity needs in a rural household. It would be run it for 4 hours a day to charge the batteries also used for photovoltaics storage, and that electricity would be enough to run a notebook computer, radio and light bulbs throughout the day and to charge the smartphones in the household. At 100 W output power, such a device would use 80 - 100 l biogas per hour (relevant source for this estimate [here](https://energypedia.info/wiki/Biogas_Appliances#Efficiency)). Four-stroke model aircraft engines that can be used to build such a generator are available for 150 USD (new).\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--51\">(51) Biogas electricity plants for villages</h4>\n\nA combination of biogas, a biogas based electricity generator, biogas storage facilities, and photovoltaics is a reasonable solution for permanent electricity supply for villages. In addition, syngas from biomass gasification would be used when not enough biogas is available.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--52\">(52) Charcoal fuelled generators</h4>\n\nBox sized (for a family) or pallet sized (for a village ward) generators that run on charcoal. See EarthOS for the design. Village people can then produce the charcoal as a side product whenever using a cooking stove or heating stove. Ideally, the generator would use CHP (\"combined heat and power\"), producing space heating and even pre-heating for cooking as well, so hardly using additional fuel. This allows electricity generation on demand, lowering the required battery capacity for photovoltaics plants (thus making them cheaper). The generator would have automatic start and stop, and automatically top up the batteries when needed.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--53\">(53) Electricity from pine needles</h4>\n\nUsing pine needles (and other currently unused biomass) in wood / biomass gasification, then driving generators with it. And cooking on the gasifier. There should be a small intermediate storage in an unpressurized gas envelope, with a lot of free space around, just enough to keep a generator running for several hours after cooking (6-8 hours if cooking twice a day). Storing larger amounts of carbon monoxide, esp. if pressurized, is really dangerous (0.05% in air is deadly in 10% of cases already \u2026). The generator should start and stop automatically when power is needed, combined with a small battery backup which will supply power &lt;50 W and higher power for a few seconds until the generator has started.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--54\">(54) Manually adjusted concentrating photovoltaics array</h4>\n\nThis leads to a photovoltaics solar farm that needs only 15 - 25% of the normal amount of PV panels per watt of electrical output, which lowers the required financial investment needs for the same electrical output.\n\nThis is achieved by combining ordinary PV panels with cheap solar concentrators (for example using reflective mylar film) and manual adjustment of these mirrors. One person would have the job to constantly walk around the plant and adjust the panels. One round would take about 15-25 minutes, as that is the time where a low-concentrating solar concentrator can stay reasonably in focus. The person can listen to educational e-books alongside :-) Alternatively, one might use trough collectors, which completely avoids the need for manual adjustments.\n\nIn any case, this idea is only viable for areas with a lot of direct sunlight, namely the trans-himalayan areas of Nepal.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--55\">(55) Photovoltaics battery charging station for villages</h4>\n\nMeant as a first, quick electrification measure, not as an ultimate or permanent solution.\n\nThere would be one photovoltaics plant in the center of the village, or one per village ward, each plant with 3-6 kW<sub>p</sub> per 1000 people, mounted on a large central pillar, or the roof of a school, or similar. Then, there would be a vending machine style device that can be used to exchange discharged batteries to freshly charged ones, always 1:1, with proper detection that a battery is inserted and not a stone. Of course it would be better to do without batteries, but even cabling throughout the village does not help since photovoltaics energy has to be available when there is no sun. And then, when batteries are needed anyway, it's better to use them in a way that avoids the need for cabling (which is expensive to install, error prone, and inefficient for low voltages).\n\nNow everyone in the village will receive 2 batteries (18650 LiIon cells harvested from notebooks, with added protection PCBs). And the villagers can self-organize how to get discharged batteries exchanged for charged ones: either going there themselves, or sending a family member with batteries of the whole family, or having somebody walk the neighborhood with a special bell every day to exchange batteries on the spot (by wearing a set of, say, 100 charged batteries and exchaning them for discharged ones). Possibly, the \"manual solution\" of somebody going around to exchange batteries can or should replace the vending machine, by simply giving that person exclusive access to the PV station's charging chamber.\n\nThis \"much\" electricity (2*8 = 16 Wh per day when exchanging both cells) of course must be used very efficiently to be sufficient. It is however enough for lighting via a brightness adjustable headlamp and to power a smartphone, FM radio and e-reader for some hours (via a USB power bank or by inserting the cell into a device made or modified to allow this).\n\nIn a second stage, there can be 24 V (6s or 7s configuration) battery packs containing many of these cells and being exchanged in a similar manner. A notebook sized 48 cell pack would contain about 300-400 Wh (when made from remanufactured, already weakened cells) and should allow to power a household's home for 3-4 days with energy efficient devices. Even power drills etc. can now be used.\n\nA business model can be developed on top of this: recharging individual cells would be free, but for recharging the big battery packs people would have to contribute in kind (food, handicrafts items, cow manure for a biogas digester or similar). Plus, excess electricity which will be available over the summer could be used to offer additional paid services or machines for rent at the photovoltaics station: grain mills etc..\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--56\">(56) Village ward biogas plants</h4>\n\nOne biogas plant per village ward, not per household. Biogas would be delivered in uncompressed plastic bags, ca. 1 m\u00b3 per household per day. This solves the problem that many households can't afford a biogas plant \u2013 a larger, combined plant (say, for 50-100 households) is much cheaper than 50-100 household-sized plants. Alternatively to the gas bag delivery, a simple network of 30 mm diameter flexible plastic pipes (35 mbar pressure) could be set up. People would have to deliver their bio waste to the plant (human manure, animal manure, veggie and fruit scraps). It would be delivered in buckets by the inhabitants (in the case of human manure, this limits spread  of infections). If there are larger amounts, gravity fed sledges can be built for animal manure and food scraps, starting at houses or central points.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--57\">(57) Metal 3D printing studio</h4>\n\nIt would use 3D printing in wax, or CNC milling of wax models, then the traditional Newari lost wax metal casting technique, in aluminium or bronze or tin (or whatnot). See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRSRCY2LzAU for a demonstration of that technique. So the data would come from people (abroad, overseas etc.), the production would be done in Nepal, and the finished objects would be sent as prepared and labelled parcel as co-shipment with tourist luggage to the international clients. This would probably be a super well running business, since, it can offer printing huge metal models for super attractive prices, probably less than 10% of what it would cost at Shapeways etc.. Artists from all over the world, and also some people needing custom machined parts, would use the service.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--58\">(58) Pressure canned village food</h4>\n\nUsing pressure canning to cook and preserve local food (incl. full dishes) made in villages in Nepal. This can then be transported to cities safely, and used as sauces, for ingredients etc. in restaurants. It can also be sold tourists who love Nepali food and return home with a few cans of it (which routes around all the crazy food safety regulations one would have to deal with for regular export / import of such food).\n\nNote that there are two different techniques: normal canning, and pressure canning, which works at higher pressures and temperatures. You need to look up which technique to use for which food to can it microbiologically safely, and also the timings and temperature \u2013 usually fruits and other sour items can be canned, and meat etc. has to be pressure canned. About the canning device: the All American Pressure Canner is a suitable device for example, since it can even be used on an open fire. See: \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzRiTCeqVSs\">Pressure Canning on a Rocket Stove</a>\".\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--59\">(59) Sell Nepali coffee to returning tourists</h4>\n\nMeans, set up a small roastery. Get a roaster, scales, packaging equipment, a good label design. Create good, original Nepali coffee, roasted and packaged in 250 g and 500 g packs (which are the most usual format in Europe).\n\nFor selling, have a stand at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu to sell to returning tourists. This should include a billboard with information about coffee import regulations per destination country (esp. free-to-import amounts), free baggage limits per airline, and scales so people can find out how much they can buy to add to their baggage for free.\n\nTourists' baggage as a means of transport for coffee for personal use works around the transportation cost problem for coffee exported from Nepal (which is currently only possible by air cargo for less-than-container loads). It also works around problem of customs, because normally exporting coffee only makes sense in larger amounts (>500 kg) and then as green beans (as the large amounts usually can't be sold fast enough for the coffee to keep fresh \u2013 roasted coffee stays fresh at most two weeks).\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--60\">(60) Export psychedelic honey from Nepal to Europe</h4>\n\nThere is psychedelic rhododendron honey in Nepal, made known to the world by the VICE [honey hunters documentary](https://video.vice.com/en_us/video/the-nepalese-honey-that-makes-people-hallucinate/57c82313938eed204a748a72).\n\nThe fun part is that customs of European Union don't know about psychedelic honey \u2013 you can import and sell it as normal honey, not as a controlled psychoactive substance. When doing that carefully and responsibly, and telling customers exactly what they get and how to use it, it is probable that this would be a sweet niche market with high margins for several years, until it might become forbidden or regulated. (And if that happens, there are of course many other markets worldwide as alternatives.)\n\nThe proof (to the best of my knowledge but without any warranties) that rhododendron honey from Nepal can be imported the same way as normal honey:\n\nHave a look at the [EU regulations for importing honey from Nepal in TARIC](http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/dds2/taric/measures.jsp?Lang=en&SimDate=20170512&Area=NP&Taric=0409000000&LangDescr=en). Basically it means: when importing honey for resale, you need: veterinary certificate, may go through veterinary inspection, duty rate 17.5% (or 0% \"development country preference rate\" for the India / Nepal etc. group of countries if the shipment value is >5000 EUR).\n\nThis seems to mean that there's no controlled substance regulation for honey (psychedelic or not) because if there was, there would be a condition \"restriction of entry into free circulation\" as, for example, for [importing hemp seeds from Nepal](http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/dds2/taric/measures.jsp?Lang=en&SimDate=20170512&Area=NP&Taric=1207992010&LangDescr=en#CD020).\n\nThere is already a (Kathmandu based) company selling that honey online now: [The Mad Honey](http://themadhoney.com/). Their prices are really attractive for sellers, given that this honey is sold locally by those who harvest it for 1000 NPR/kg or similar (as reported by a friend who bought a few kilograms in Rukum or Rolpa district).\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--61\">(61) Travel through Nepal's villages and sell coffee farming machines</h4>\n\nThat is, sell small machines for coffee processing, and teach farmers about coffee farming, and leave coffee farming manuals. Farmers in Nepal need processing equipment and knowledge more than trade connections in order to be able to make a living from coffee farming, since prices are really high in Nepal when compared to other countries.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--62\">(62) Sell own handicrafts products on Etsy and DaWanda</h4>\n\nThis is part of the general principle that selling unique products on international markets can work, even though international shipment of small lots is prohibitively expensive for non-unique products.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--63\">(63) Become a remote web software moderator / admin</h4>\n\nNepal is becoming an attractive outsourcing location for computer work due to the good English skills of many in Nepal, and the low wage level after considering the currency exchange rate.\n\nThe problem is how to find a foothold in this market as a freelancer / solo entrepreneur. A recommendation is to look up modern, trending open source software packages that are used by large community sites, forums and social networks. For example [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/), potentially the world's most advanced open source forum software. (We also use it right here on this website.) By looking at open source software only, you can be sure that (1) it will be in widespread use and (2) you can learn it without paying any money because you can install it on your own computer for free.\n\nNote that this work does not require programming skills. If you can work well with complex software like Microsoft Word, you can become a Discourse moderator. That work consists of sorting and tagging content, moderating discussions, deleting spam posts and spam users, offensive posts etc.. You can then further extend your skills (and increase your pay) lateron by learning Discourse admin tasks: handling backups, repairing the database, managing e-mail problems, learning Ruby console to extract information from the database and script / program custom changes to content and settings etc..\n\nSo after you selected the software package you want to specialize in, and learned all the basics on your own from online materials, you can then look for sites using that software and approach them as a potential addition to their team. Most of the organizations behind these sites will not even have thought about outsourcing work to other countries, but when you explain it well to them and demonstrate your skills, it will be attractive for many of them. Because a freelance consultant working over the Internet from Nepal as a web software moderator and admin is _at least_ three times cheaper than their local staff in Europe or USA. I assume that for a well-experienced Discourse admin from Nepal, for example, an hourly rate of 7 USD is realistic (not for a novice, for somebody with at least 3 years experience).\n\nTo find out which website is based on the software package you specialized in, you can use web framework detector tools like [Built With](https://builtwith.com/), [Wappalyzer](https://wappalyzer.com/), [What CMS?](https://whatcms.org/) and [Guess CMS Detector](http://guess.scritch.org/).\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--64\">(64) Outsourcing agency for web platform moderation / administration</h4>\n\nBuilding on the last business idea (no. 63), it is of course also possible to transform a solo web moderator business into an agency by training employees in Nepal in the moderator and admin skills you acquired. A bit like [Cloud Factory](https://www.cloudfactory.com) (a great startup from Nepal actually!) but more specialized and on a much smaller scale.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--65\">(65) Produce GoSol solar cookstoves, dehydrators, ovens and roasters</h4>\n\nThe [GoSol SOL](http://www.gosol.org/technology) devices are a proven and tested technology for direct solar thermal use. Like the solar stove devices that have been around for a decade, but much more powerful (up to 6 kW) and they actually work. This is applicable for all areas in Nepal with a lot of direct sunlight (means, little cloud cover) and little firewood for fuel. So especially for the trans-himalayan highlands.\n\nIn addition, the technology is also useful for commercial operators in cities, for example coffee roasters and food processors (fruit dehydration etc.). The rooftop terraces are an obvious choice of location. For commercial use in cities, fully automated operation would be desirable, as human worktime is more expensive in cities. Which would be a nice addition to the GoSol technology. For roasters, you could base this automatic solution on the open source [Artisan Roaster Scope](https://github.com/artisan-roaster-scope/artisan/blob/master/README.md) software, combined with [Arduino TC4 boards](http://www.mlgp-llc.com/arduino/public/arduino-pcb.html) to actually control the roaster's fan and heater. Add in some nice weather forecast incl. cloud cover prediction so the roaster knows when there is enough sun in the next 20 minutes to start roasting a batch. This can be built on top of [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/), which provides a 5-day forecast with 3 hour granularity, and updates every 3 hours.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--66\">(66) Open source optical sorter for coffee beans (or nuts etc.)</h4>\n\nA small-scale, cheap optical sorter for green coffee beans and possibly other agricultural products. You can build a coffee processing business out of this (much better than sorting coffee by hand as usual \u2026) or you could produce and sell these machines in Nepal, as the design will be open source.\n\nFirst, we have to develop this machine together, though. For that, and all other details, head over to my [initiative to get this machine funded and built](/t/id/7122). Welcome to get involved (this project is actually happening now!).\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--67\">(67) Traffic jam bicycle</h4>\n\nEssentially a new, faster means of transportation in Kathmandu: a bicycle that is optimized for driving through traffic jams. It would be faster than all other means of transport in Kathmandu during peak traffic times and probably during most of the day. To be fast, it can be a powerful electric bicycle, but the concept can also work purely mechanically.\n\nIts features would be a narrow handlebar, thick foam cushioning on all outer surfaces to not scratch vehicles, and a vertical rotating flywheel to provide high stability when driving very slow between vehicles. In addition, a saddle that can be lowered with the touch of a button to be able to balance the bicycle with the feet on the ground when slipping through between vehicles; afterwards, one would flip the button again and the saddle would move up again to a mechanical upper limit. This would be provided by compressed air from a mechanical wheel hub air compressor that can be pumped into and let out of a \"normal\" cushioned saddle tube.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--68\">(68) Mountain farming on newly deposited soil</h4>\n\nThis idea is for those looking for an \"extreme farming\" challenge. Due to the changing climate, many mountain areas that were too cold to cultivate anything are now potential locations for farming. There are huge tracts of land in the wider Himalaya area that are completely unused and barren, with no competition for using or owning them. Their big problem is of course that still nothing grows because there is no soil:\n\n> There is also an upper limit to how far plants can move [uphill] since there is no topsoil at extreme altitudes to support plant life. ([source](https://www.nepalitimes.com/banner/mixed-blessings-in-mustang/))\n\nBut soil is just compost mixed with pulverized stones and ideally [biochar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochar), in the right quantities. So if we transport biomass from the closest location that has it (which may be in the valley near a river), create the crushed stones on site and mix it, we have the soil. Now it has to be deposited in an erosion-resistant way (in pits, ditches and human-made or natural terraces), which is obviously a lot of work and requires a small excavator with a hydraulic jackhammer. And then more work for solutions that direct the rainwater to the plants, and store it where needed.\n\nBut it's rewarding: climate change can be used to increase the available farmland and also the land available for wild plants and animals.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--69\">(69) Alibaba delivery service</h4>\n\nThe Chinese website [Alibaba Express](http://aliexpress.com) is a treasure for getting all kinds of equipment and spare parts. Even in Europe, many spare parts are only available on Aliexpress \u2013 you can for example buy a laser printer fuser assembly for 100 EUR right in Europe, or you can buy only the broken part (a fuser roller) inside it for 9 EUR from Aliexpress.\n\nAnd Nepal is much closer to China, so delivery can be organized in less than a week using cheap overland transport. The way to organize it would be to have a proxy shipment address inside China at the train station closest to the Nepali border (Lhasa). Everyone from Nepal ordering from the normal AliExpress website just orders their stuff to go there. Then the company at that address organizes one car or truck transport per week to bring the items to Kathmandu and to distribute them in the capital themselves, and in other cities and areas by postal service.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--70\">(70) Producing supercap-buffered systems for solar self-consumption</h4>\n\nThis is a new idea that can make rooftop solar cost-effective where it is currently not: namely, in all places where people have access to the grid but are not rewarded for exporting excess solar electricity to the grid. The system can be easily produced in Nepal from locally available components, and supercaps (which will have to be imported).\n\nThe idea is explained in detail [here](/t/id/9030).\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--71\">(71) Solar electrical cargo bicycle</h4>\n\nThis can be built on the basis of an existing cargo bicycle of various types (in Nepal: the [Portal Bikes Long-Tail](http://www.portalbikes.org/long-tail)), or of course also by building the portal bike oneself. Cargo bicycles of various types can be used since the modification is about adding solar-clad boxes. However, the single tracked versions ([Long Tail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freight_bicycle#Longtail_bicycle) and [Long John](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freight_bicycle#Long_John_bicycle) types) may be the most suitable in the hilly area as they can go on single-track paths, and of these the Long Tail version has better off-road capabilities. The case study below is for Long Tail bicycles.\n\nThe solar electric version would consist of a box over the back wheel, and maybe a smaller similar box over the front wheel, with extensions down to the wheel hub. So the box has flaps on the left and right to access it, and is about 50-65 cm wide. The flaps and top, and maybe the back resp. front side, would be covered in photovoltaics panels. In addition, below these panels another layer of panels can extend to the back resp. front, for about 2/3 of the length of the box. In addition, in low traffic conditions and when stationery, the flaps can be aligned to the sun, by folding them up to 180\u00b0 up. Together, that would be up to 600 W<sub>p</sub> of photovoltaics panels. The solar panels would be of the thin, plastic covered type to save weight, and to protect them there would be a wire mesh in a distance of 5 cm and bumper corners and edges. So even when the bicycle falls over, the panels must survive. This should also make it possible to use the top of the box as carrier rack (which should be in a height of ca. 130 cm because it should be possible to lock backwards with the box mounted). To lift the bicycle over obstacles, it should be possible to detach the box and carry it like an external frame backpack.\n\nFor the electrical system, a hub motor (better for hills) will be used, and ca. 30 Wh of supercaps and a small Li-Ion battery. The stored energy should be just enough to drive up a typical Nepali hill (ca. 600 m altitude difference) when combined with human power and a little solar input as seen on cloudy days. On sunny days, it will be easier and faster as the sun will do most of the work. More than driving up one hill is not needed, as energy will be produced from regenerative braking on the way down, and also from solar input. It is even possible to put additional load (stones or water) on the bicycle in order to generate more energy on the way down. In total, the required battery will probably be only 20% the size of a typical cargo bicycle, making this version cheaper and also requiring less battery replacement / maintenance costs.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--72\">(72) Dockless bicycle sharing system</h4>\n\nWhile many other cities have this, Kathmandu and probably all other cities in Nepal does not yet have a [dockless bicycle sharing system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle-sharing_system#Dockless_bikes), or, in fact, any bicycle sharing system.\n\nIt's not that difficult to create though, given that there is open source software available for this (see [opensourcebikeshare.com](https://opensourcebikeshare.com/) and [openbikeinitiative.org](http://openbikeinitiative.org/)).\n\nSince Kathmandu is not cycle-friendly at all, the bicycle sharing scheme should be complemented with a bicycle optimized navigation app (see the following idea for that, no. 73). All bicycles would come with a waterproof handlebar-mounted case where the user puts in their own smartphone to use as a navigation system. The case would also protect from direct sunlight.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--73\">(73) Cycling and walking navigation apps for Kathmandu</h4>\n\nKathmandu is not a cycle-friendly city, but one has to start somewhere if one were to _make_ it cycle-friendly. It is quite ok to cycle in Kathmandu when knowing all the small streets and paths without heavy traffic (esp. without trucks), and when knowing when and where will be rush-hour traffic. For example, cycling at midnight in Kathmandu on the main roads is extremely fast, as there is neither traffic nor traffic lights or police guiding the traffic.\n\nTo benefit from this knowledge, there would be a special navigation app that guides the occasional cyclists through these small streets. That could be based on [OsmAnd](http://osmand.net/), the best open source map and navigation app for Android (see the [licence details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OsmAnd#Licensing)). All routing in that app is done offline, so data rates and mobile reception are not an issue.\n\nThe app would gather its cycling recommendations from its users, by asking users after a trip to rate its cycle-friendliness (perhaps split in sections, and allowing users to add a voice note).\n\nThe same principle can be applied to walking in Kathmandu: it is well walkable if you know where to walk to avoid air pollution, street noise etc.. Finally, the same principle can be applied to other modes of transportation, such as roller blades, electric roller blades, foldable kickboards (electric or not), mixed mode transportation using a folding bicycle plus buses and taxis, etc..\n\nThe way to make a business from this idea would probably be to create and publish the software under open source licences, and then to offer setting up and maintaining the system to city administrations worldwide. That would include gathering the first routing information oneself, adding other routing information from traffic counters etc., and then start with community building so that users collect and update the routing information from then on. Still, the business will need to do quality checks, error fixes etc. on that data.\n\nAs of 2020-03, thee is now an open source multi-model routing engine that could be configured for the routing tasks abve, and already includes a nice software infrastructure for consulting data sources beyond map data for routing decisions (such as historical or current traffic information). The project is [Multimodal Routing](https://multimodalrouting.github.io/), and its source code is [available on Github](https://github.com/multimodalrouting).\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--74\">(74) Public transport routing system</h4>\n\nGoogle (and others) provide public transport routing for many cities, but not for Kathmandu as there is no proper data source for timetables and routes, and anyway times are only very approximate.\n\nThis can be fixed by crowdsourcing the bus routes that exist, similar to how it's done by [Transport for Cairo](http://transportforcairo.com/). In addition, one can create an adaptive real-time routing system by attaching GPS trackers to the buses (hacked from a cheap, used smartphones and a big magnet). This will be more accurate and dependable than \"timetables and the usual delays\", and means that there is no need at all to define timetables for Kathmandu and other cities in Nepal. Defined routes plus a realtime routing app is fine.\n\nAgain, like with the cycling and walking navigation apps (see idea 73), this idea can be made into a business by setting up the system and offering its setup and maintenance to city administrations worldwide.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--75\">(75) Novel bamboo furniture</h4>\n\nBamboo is a great material since it grows much faster than trees (6-8 m long timber bamboo is harvested at 6-9 years of age, small bamboo much earlier), is strong and versatile. Like wood, it can even be processed into multi-layer sheet material. And there are many more unexplored ways to use it:\n\nThis idea is about combining bamboo and (recycled) plastic into a flexible furniture construction system that also allows custom, made-to-order sizes.\n\nUnlike traditional furniture, incorporating CNC-milled or 3D printed plastic elements allows to create furniture with moving parts. For example:\n\n* foldable clothes drying stands\n* clothes dryers that extend from the wall\n* folding chairs\n* [camp beds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_bed) in the style of the [US Army folding cot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:American_Army_Folding_Bed-WWII.jpg) ([more images](https://www.google.com/search?q=US+army+folding+cot&tbm=isch))\n* standing desk with height-adjustable desk surface\n\nCNC milling or 3D printing would be needed in order to produce the connecting plastic parts exactly for the inner and outer diameters of the bamboo tubes at hand.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--76\">(76) Nut and seed cheeses</h4>\n\nThis is really weird, but: it's possible to make proper, tasty, aged, fermented cheese not just from animal milk but also from all kinds of nuts that have protein and fat. Even from stuff that grows in abundance wild and that usually nobody eats like (as an example from Europe) acorns. Not sure what the right raw material would be in Nepal, but there will be something. Maybe even the seeds of jackfruits (yes, you can eat them \u2026 google it \u2026 also, I tried it).\n\nFor sure, vegan-crazed tourists will love these cheeses. You could sell them, for example, to some of the vegan restaurants in Kathmandu.\n\nHere are some links:\n\n* [recipe for aged camembert cheese from cashew nuts](https://fullofplants.com/vegan-aged-camembert-cheese/)\n\n* [starter kits for nut cheese](https://www.cashewbert.com/) (shipped inside Europe)\n\n* [webshop with six specialty nut cheeses](https://www.reinevegancuisine.com/online-store) and crazy prices\n\n* [nut cheeses from acorn, pinyon pine nuts, black walnuts](http://www.urbanoutdoorskills.com/gallery.html) etc.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--77\">(77) Dry toilet system for cities</h4>\n\nFlush toilet systems produce a big mess that as to be cleaned up again \u2013 as everyone who ever crossed over Bagmati river in Kathmandu can testify. However, dry toilet systems of various sorts slowly emerge as viable alternatives, and there is a lot of space for innovative public utility entrepreneurs here. Especially in countries that have no working sewage treatment systems, like Nepal.\n\nA design of my own and a discussion of existing dry toilet systems in cities worldwide is here: \"[Dry toilet system for cities](/t/9163)\".\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--78\">(78) Healthy cooking stove</h4>\n\nIn Nepal, household air pollution due to the use of solid cooking fuels shortens the average lifespan by 15 months (source; but it's even more for the 65% cooking this way in Nepal, because 15 months seems to be averaged over the whole population in South Asia).\n\nThis can be pretty much fixed by selling cooking stoves that do not let any smoke escape into the house \u2013 there is no need to persuade people to switch to a different (more expensive) cooking fuel like LPG or electricity. To the contrary, the improved stove can be made 30-50% more fuel efficient by integrating a heat sheath and insulation around the pot ([source](https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2014/07/cooking-pot-insulation-key-to-sustainable-cooking.html)). If not health reasons, than the fuel savings should be a good argument to get such a stove.\n\nRough design proposal:\n\n* The pot should be embedded into the stove. This allows to route the hot air around it on the way to the exhaust, and to integrate insulation on the other side. This will lead to 30-50% savings in fuel costs.\n\n* It should be a rocket stove, as these are more fuel efficient and emit less smoke.\n\n* Chimney construction and stove construction should be carefully done to ensure that natural updraft prevents any smoke from exiting, even when refilling the stove.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--79\">(79) DIY indoor air filters</h4>\n\nAir quality in Kathmandu valley is dismal but can be improved a lot on an individual level with HEPA air filters placed into the rooms of the house. Such filters are available as industrial products for 600-800 USD in India for example, but that is not affordable for the average city dweller. There is also no reason at all why they have to be that expensive. Full instructions for an effective air filter that more or less everyone can make are [here](https://smartairfilters.com/en/blog/how-to-make-diy-air-purifier/). Alternatively, you could import and sell the simple but more industrially produced air filter based on the guy's instructions and sold on Taobao as [The Cannon](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.1-c.w4004-7525708604.1.qpI0ol&id=36350325474) for ca. 70 USD.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--80\">(80) Import used photovoltaics panels from Europe and USA</h4>\n\nIn both Europe and the USA, used photovoltaics panels are available in large quantities for purchase. They cost typcially about 30% of the brand-new price of modules with the same rated output, and they still work like new or with 10-15% less output due to degradation over time. The reason why they are sold so cheaply is because photovoltaics installations should be done with all panels of the same manufacturer and type, and used modules are not available in large enough quantities at the same time for the typical installations done in Europe or the USA these days.\n\nOn the other hand, photovoltaics panels are sold with exorbitant high prices in the small shops in Kathmandu (it was 200-300% the international average in 2015 when I last loked). And in villages, prices are probably even higher.\n\nAnd in Nepal, especially in villages, people only need 1-2 panels (100-400 W) per household, which can totally be supplied from batches of used panels. So clearly, there is a business opportunity: let somebody in Europe or the USA collect PV panels until there is a full 20 ft ISO container of them, then ship the container to Kathmandu and sell the panels to PV panel shops all across the country. Also provide a direct outlet and a webshop, in order to force shops to drop their sales prices \u2013 otherwise, Nepali people would still not get to enjoy cheap clean energy.\n\nIn addition, there are special inverters that do away with the requirement that all panels have to be of the same type for an efficient installation (namely, SolarEdge inverters, due to their separate [Power Optimizer](https://www.solaredge.com/products/power-optimizer#/) devices). It's just that people don't know that these inverters can be used to make better use of used photovoltaics panels, but they can. You could import them to Nepal as well.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--81\">(81) Trans-himalayan farming</h4>\n\nTrans-himalayan areas allow some farming; for example, Jumla and Mustang provide local apples to markets in Nepal. Production is however limited by water availability.\n\nHere, water harvesting techniques known from desert areas can be employed. They can be combined with modern improvements \u2013 see here for a proposal that would increase the potential growing areas by nearly 600% due to an improved water harvesting technique:\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/creating-desert-forests-with-giant-self-watering-pots/9690\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--2\">(82) Trans-himalayan photovoltaics plants</h4>\n\nThis is certainly at least a slightly crazy idea, and may not be applicable in the next 5 years, but I am sure its time will come :-)\n\nSolar panels profit from the conditions provides by some trans-himalayan areas in Nepal:\n\n* high solar irradiation, because the sky is mostly clear as the mountains keep away the clouds and the rain\n* cold air temperatures year round due to the altitude, which improves the electrical efficiency of the PV panels (a PV cell temperature reduction of 20 \u00b0C leads to 9-12% more electricity generation \u2013 see [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876610213000829) at p. 2 in the PDF)\n* no disturbance of nature by use of area (because there is no vegetation in these areas anyway)\n* no competition with agriculture / food production, or with land use for accommodation\n* cheap land prices, as the land is basically unused\n* some mountain slopes provide a 30\u00b0 south inclination naturally, lowering the need for and costs of the sub-structure needed to hold the PV panels at the perfect angle\n\nDue to the climatic conditions alone, the Himalayan region and Southern Andes region are the areas with the highest possible PV output per installed capacity worldwide, and the Himalayan region is the most interesting here:\n\n> The regions with the largest irradiation values have large PV potentials. In particular, the Himalaya and Southern Andes regions have energy potentials of more than 1800 kWh/kW PV, due to the combination of large irradiation values and low temperatures. The Himalayan region is especially attractive because it is near regions with large future energy demands, such as China and India. ([source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876610213000829), p. 8 in the PDF)\n\nThis is confirmed by the [Global Solar Atlas](https://globalsolaratlas.info/), an interactive map that shows solar potential worldwide, calculated with an inclusion of air temperature ([see](https://globalsolaratlas.info/about/data-description)). It shows that Nepal has several sites with >2000 <abbr title=\"kilowatt hours per kilowatt of installed PV capacity and year\">kWh\u00b7kW<sub>p</sub><sup>-1</sup>\u00b7a<sup>-1</sup></abbr>, and that these are among the highest values worldwide. For comparison, PV yields in central Germany hover around _half_ of this, making solar electrical generation twice as expensive there, and still it's applied on a wide scale.\n\nCreating a PV plant in such a remote area and connecting it to the national grid is quite a challenge, of course. It means that it makes only sense for large projects \u2013 but the space for large projects is easily available. For example, covering a a 2\u00d72 km mountain slope with PV panels will be very roughly a 600 MW plant, which would already be among [the largest worldwide](http://www.pvresources.com/en/pvpowerplants/top50pv.php).\n\nYou can use the [Global Solar Atlas](https://globalsolaratlas.info/) to find your perfect project location. My personal favourite so far is the mountain slope at `28.799668, 83.471674` ([map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/28\u00b047'58.8\"N+83\u00b028'18.0\"E/@28.7996585,83.3258035,10z/), [3D view](https://www.google.com/maps/place/28%C2%B053'10.8%22N+83%C2%B019'23.1%22E/@28.8033981,83.4753642,4253a,35y,301.5h,73.07t/data=!3m1!1e3!4m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d28.8863246!4d83.3230769), [Global Solar Atlas map](https://globalsolaratlas.info/?c=28.921631,83.49359,7&s=28.90961,83.348752)). It has the following benefits:\n\n* 2050 - 2080 kWh\u00b7kW<sub>p</sub><sup>-1</sup>\u00b7a<sup>-1</sup> expected solar yield\n* 60-80 km from Pokhara, so the connection to the national grid is manageable\n* 30\u00b0 south inclination, allowing to install PV panels without expensive frame substructure\n* quite smooth, vegetation free mountain slope, allowing a relatively easy installation\n* not in a national park, to avoid issues with construction permits\n\nFor examples of existing PV installations at high altitudes, [see here](http://www.pvresources.com/en/pvpowerplants/highaltitudes.php).\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--83\">(83) Solar Power Panels with microgrid option</h4>\n\n_This is a product idea for a special type of photovoltaics panels that is especially suitable for villages without an electrical grid. Such a product can be produced locally inside the country, as it just needs normal solar panels, cables, electronic parts and some plastic parts (which can be 3D printed)._\n\n_The following is the rather long and unsorted set of notes about this, which (for now) I just copy & paste here from my internal document:_\n\n\n##### Basic proposal and system layout\n\nEvery house gets one 40-50 W<sub>p</sub> solar panel with charge controller and batteries attached to its back, called a \"powerpanel\". This is sufficient for lighting, mobile phone charging, radio, and tablet computer use, also for notebook use and charging during the day. The battery should be LiIon or LiFeO4, in 18650 cells to be flat behind the panel. It will be suitable for 2,000 cycles by only cycling between 20 and 80%. Combining everything into one weatherproof device reduces breakage through bad cabling connections, water damage etc. in the house.\n\nThe only connections needed for powerpanels are cables into the house (both 12 V DC and 24 V DC are supplied, with 24 V DC preferred for lower losses) and optionally cables to neighbors (24 V DC or 48 V DC for lower losses, to be decided). Cables are attached in weatherproof manner without tools to the back of the panel, without a need to prepare cable ends (needs special clamps). Cables will be supplied locally, also additional lamps etc.. Some LED lamps and mobile phone chargers will come with the powerpanel, though. Also a flashlight (headlight) with charger.\n\nThe status can be read from a special socket that includes a LCD with watt hours left in the battery (also as a bar diagram), and the estimated time until empty or charged based on current use or sun input. That socket will communicate with the powerpanel over SPI or a similar protocol, using the power wires. The socket also comes in an additional variant that allows to connect a smartphone or computer by Bluetooth or wifi, to read energy statistics and make configuration settings, but that is all optional. It is sufficient if a technicial has that device.\n\nTo scale the system, houses can install multiple powerpanels and connect them with the \"to neighbors\" lines while configuring the panels to know that both are of the same owner.\n\nOne special attribute of this system is that it forms a microgrid. Neighbors can help each other out with electricity, and the excess available at neighbors (in batteries during the night and also in production during the day) will also be shown in the special socket's LCD.\n\nLike any off-grid solar system, these installations will produce a lot of excess solar power. This might provide an interesting way of financing the system: it is installed in every home for free or for a very affordable price, in exchange for all the unused electricity. The unused electricity is then sold to businesses, as electricity or better in the form of useful services (water pumping, battery powertool renting station, grinding and threshing station, refrigeration container etc.). This might be provided as an outdoor 230 V AC electrical socket where people use coins (and / or smartphones) to pay for operating their machines from them. Only the \"dependable\" part is sold off this way (based on a weather forecast), while the rest goes to non-critical consumers like a refrigerator with a large thermal battery (\"ice block\"), or water pumping to an uphill storage area.\n\nA typical solar potential in the Nepali midhills is 1500 kWh/kW<sub>p</sub> per year, see http://globalsolaratlas.info/?c=28.076827,85.286865,8&s=27.931327,85.14679 . So 4.16 kWh/kW<sub>p</sub> per day on average. A village with 500 houses with a 50 W<sub>p</sub> panel each has 25 kW<sub>p</sub> installed capacity, so 4.16 kWh/kW<sub>p</sub> * 25 kW<sub>p</sub> = 104.16 kWh/d on average. Of these, 44.16 kWh might be used during an average day (88 Wh per house, enough for three full phones or tablets and 50 Wh lighting). So on an average day, 60 kWh/d are available for free, of which maybe 45 kWh are usable due to line and conversion losses. This is enough for (for example) 5 water pumps of 2 kW each running for 4.5 hours each.\n\nTo minimize line losses even in dispersed villages, several 48 V DC trunk lines would be installed, and all houses would connect to these (not directly to their neighbors). And there would be several usage points in one village for the \"commercial electricity\", not just one. Using such \"trunks\" has also the advantage that individual powerpanels do not need to \"route through\" any energy \u2013 they need only a DC-DC controller strong enough to put its own output \"on the grid\", at the grid's voltage of 48 V DC.\n\nEven better and simpler, there should be 48 V DC lines throughout the house as well, so that the powerpanel needs only one DC-DC converter for its output, to the house and grid combined. Then in the house, sockets will have step-down converters, and might even be switchable between 6, 12 (rather 15) and 24 (rather 28) V DC. Just not by end users, as that will lead to broken equipment. This way, thinner and cheaper cables can be used. Only operating high-powered tools is not possible, but this is not planned either. If a 500 W powertool would be used, it would be a battery-operated one anyway. These DC-DC converters would be switched off if no load is connected, saving the standby power use. An additional advantage of this setup is that traditional fuses / fuseboxes are not necessary (except for one main fuse in the powerpanel). Because DC-DC converters will regulate the down in case their current rating is exceeded, if necessary down to zero in case of a short. This reduces maintenance effort and improves reliability (no need to find the triggered fuse etc.), and also improves safety as the down-regulation is instantaneous and not depending on tens of seconds of overload as in the case of thermal fuses.\n\nThis setup seems very sufficient, as it will take a long time until households add more consumers (probably powertools at first, which can be charged with the current setup without issues, esp. by utilizing excess electricity from neighbors).\n\nThe powermodule box should not be integrateable with the PV panel, but mountable to its back. This allows to upgrade existing PV panels (cutting system costs by 40%) and also to utilize 60-70% cheaper second hand PV panels of all kinds of different sizes and types.\n\nInstead of powerline communications (or network cables or drilled two-wire with ADSL etc.) between powerpanels, long-range wifi would be used, together with the Guifi architecture. This has the lowest capital costs and maintenance requirements, and is sufficient for both the communications necessary in the microgrid and for providing Internet. Since powerpanels will typically be mounted on a rooftop or pole, they are already in the right place to add the wifi antenna.\n\n\n##### Grid voltage, home voltage and grid connection\n\nDiscussion of the grid voltage, home voltage and grid connection (resulting in 60 V DC for the grid and 24 V DC for the home, see at the end): \n\nThe energy routing functionality can be with or without a permanent grid connection. With it, a dynamic equilibrium of \"zero current to / from grid\" would be maintained except an import or export has been negotiated. This needs DC-DC converters with current limiting for the battery output so that it only supplies as much as the house needs (while the charge controller only supplies the battery). This means two DC-DC converter even for using electricity in-house, which is a waste. Also, regulation is more tricky, and the setup feels \"dependent\". \n\nInstead, there should not be a permanent grid connection (and having it is even optional). There would be one DC-DC converter with current limiting at the grid interconnection. Normally, it is disconnected with a MOSFET (not using any energy in standby). If the powerpanel negotiated an import or export from teh grid, it will be configured and connected in the right direction, with the right current limit as negotiated. In order to take electricity from the grid or put it on the grid, the powerpanel first has to negotiate with other grid devices how much and from whom, using the long-range wifi network. In the case of exporting, it then has to fulfill this \"contract\", if necessary even by using its own internal battery in case that short-term solar fluctuations do not allow generating enough energy on the fly. This makes the grid dependable for all consumers and uses the batteries of all connected devices for \"distributed grid stabilization\". Contracts would usually be short (2-10 minutes), so the load on the batteries is low. Longer contracts would be paid better as there is a higher \"risk\" for the provider that he might need more expensive battery electricity to fulfill it. \n\nThis setup also allows to create the powerpanel device by combining off-the-shelf components, as no charge controller with current limiting is required. Instead, just a normal charge controller, a DC-DC converter, a Raspberry Pi computer etc.. \n\nHowever, a hybrid solution between grid connected and not is possible and even better. To decouple the battery voltage from the grid voltage (allowing to use normal 12 / 24 V charge controllers not rare 48 V ones), charge controller and battery should be in a 12 V section (given that small solar panels are always for 12 V anyway, operated at 15 - 18 V DC). Then, there is one DC-DC converter that can supply consumers both in the house and in the grid, with a relay or MOSFET to cut off the grid connection (which is the normal case, so there is no need to keep a dynamic equilibrium normally). When there is an import or export contract with the grid, the current limit of the DC-DC converter is adapted dynamically to keep within these limits. \n\nThe problem with this setup is the conversion waste: 18 V (solar panel output) \u2192 12 V or 24 V (charge controller output) \u2192 48 V (grid and house) \u2192 12 V (consumption points in the house, mostly). At 95% efficiency of DC-DC converters and three conversions, this means 86% total conversion efficiency. Obviously, with a 48 V battery and a special (open source) charge controller for that, this can be reduced to two conversions, resulting in 90.25% conversion efficiency. This is as good as it gets, since LED lamps, DC adapters for notebooks and USB charging etc. use an integrated DC-DC converter anyway, even if the grid voltage would be 12 V DC. So it's better to provide versions that convert directly from 48 V DC, as that has 16 times lower line losses than 12 V DC. However, having that third conversion also makes sense as it keeps the grid voltage stable, isolated from the fluctuations of battery voltage. Obviously, it also limits the load to what the DC-DC converter can supply, but that is also an integrated safety feature. \n\nFurther efficiency improvements would be possible with 48 V consumers in the house, but these are not really available. \n\nSo in effect, the best seems to be to rather split the voltages between 60 V DC in the grid (highest \"safe\" DC voltage everywhere worldwide, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra-low_voltage) and 24 V in the house (allowing to use 24 V DC fridges etc. and having acceptable line losses, 4 times lower than 12 V DC). And then also to use a 24 V battery, accepting slightly fluctuating voltages in the house (but not in the grid). The small 12 V panels can still be used, as there is a MPPT conversion from panel to battery anyway, and conversion efficiency is not much influenced by the voltage step. This way, there is ideally only one conversion from panels to battery voltage (but not later from battery to consumers). Efficiency is obviously more important for larger loads \u2013 this is the case if large loads are 24 V DC, such as a 24 V DC fridge. A 24 V house voltage has the additional advantage that the battery is directly connected to consumers, allowing higher loads (500 W for powertools) and then recharging the battery quickly from the grid if necessary. Also, 24 V powertools are available, and 18 V etc. powertools can easily be operated at 24 V by using PWM current limiting. \n\nA bidirectional DC-DC converter with current limiting can provide the required connection to the grid, such as one using split-pi topology (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-pi_topology).\n\n\n##### Grid to battery connection\n\nThe grid DC-DC converter would always connect the grid to the battery, either potentially charging it (when importing and not all is used by current loads) or potentially discharging it (when current production is not enough to meet the current load and current contracted export). Obviously, that requires the DC-DC converter to have a variable output, as it may have to act as a charge controller. Not as a MPPT controller though, which limits its complexity. \n\nWhen importing the DC-DC converter can not be connected to the panel side (to save the second charge controller logic). It would confuse the MPPT controller's regulation if this power source provides a constant voltage as long as it is within the contract conditions, and then that voltage suddenly goes to zero when hitting the limit of the current power import contract. Also, such a setup would reduce the efficiency by having two DC-DC conversions in series. \n\nWhen exporting, it seems not practical either to connect the grid DC-DC converter's input directly to the solar panels. This would increase efficiency by eliminating one of two DC-DC conversion steps. But it adds complexity as the DC-DC controller now needs to include a MPPT controller, and (worse) when the PV module's production is not sufficient for the current demand of the export, additional input would have to come from the battery somehow. The simplest solution is to keep the DC-DC controller permanently connected to the battery, as in the original proposal above. Electricity exported to the grid is typically \"excess power\" anyway, so increasing the efficiency when exporting is not important.\n\n\n##### Solving the DC grid management problem\n\nAn advantage of this setup where there is no direct access of electrical consumers to the grid is that it solves the task of DC grid management (which is normally difficult because no AC power factor can be utilized to direct currents to specific loops in a grid). \n\nIn the DC grid, current will only flow after a contract has been negotiated, and that contract's limit will be electrically safe (respecting maximum currents for all sections in the grid, due to cable diameters). In a meshed grid, it will still be difficult to know before where currents will flow when adding an additional source and load. But the distribution of currents over the different routes between two points can be tested (with small currents) when only this one source and one load exist in the grid. This test can be done regularly for every connection of two points (to account for varying resistance of wire connections etc.), for example by reserving the first 20 minutes every morning for testing so that each combination of source and load is tested every month. Line losses between each two points would also be tested at the same time. The test results are then saved and used when negotiating contracts. \n\nNote that adding a new contract may involve modifying existing ones, as some current flows will cancel each other out, and limits might have to be adapted. For example, when observing that an existing contract did never utilize its maximum power transfer capacity but that maximum prevents another contract from being added, that limit could be automatically re-negotiated.\n\n\n##### Miscellanea issues and remarks\n\nNow the issue with a 60 V DC grid is how to use that energy efficiently. Battery powertools with PWM current limiting can be used. 60 V DC motors for pumps etc. are widely available. In cases where high-power 230 V AC electricity is desired, installing a large inverter is not a good idea as it costs a lot and is not user-repairable when it breaks. However, a motor-generator can be used as a DIY solution, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor\u2013generator . Efficiency is here less of a concern, as this is \"excess\" electricity anyway.\n\nThere will be a Raspberry Pi device inside the powerpanel, taking on all communication and regulation functions. It will have wifi (for the house), an additional long-range wifi adapter connected via USB (for external communications and Internet access), SPI (for communications over power cables in the house to sockets and devices). Because there is always a wifi device in the powerpanel, its configuration interface can be provided as an app / local website.\n\nIt is possible to use a compressor fridge even with only a small battery, if it is a custom (open source) model using an ice block or similar for cold storage, and fan for circulating the cold air when it is needed. Then, the fridge will only consume energy when the sun is out, not from the battery.\n\nNote that with a 60 V DC grid, all kinds of other generation equipment can also contribute electricity when needed, for example combustion engines connected to biogas (or biogas plus hydrogen) plants, micro-hydro power stations, wind power stations etc.. It is ok for these devices to not use current limiting at the source if they are ok to perhaps provide more than contracted (that is, some electricity for free). Current limiting is expensive at higher power, as it needs a DC-DC conversion (PWM current limiting is not applicable here as the grid expects continuous current always).\nOne of these power panels can also be used for each solar streetlight. (Even though this should be avoided as much as possible, to prevent light pollution.) The streetlight would be 7-10 W permanent and 40 W on demand when motion is detected.\nA nice property of this proposal is that \"very standard\" 250 V 16 A cables (1.5 mm\u00b2 cross-section resp. 15 AWG) can be used to connect houses to the larger trunk lines. So basically, normal household extension cords. With a good waterproof way of interconnection, it will be possible to just connect several available pieces of cable. The line losses are acceptable: such a cable will lose at most 8.9% of transported energy, for the assumed maximum distance of 300 m, at 60 V and 0.85 A maximum current, corresponding to 51 W exported energy. See [this voltage drop calculation](http://www.calculator.net/voltage-drop-calculator.html?material=copper&wiresize=10.45&voltage=60&phase=dc&noofconductor=1&distance=300&distanceunit=meters&amperes=0.85&x=56&y=19).\n\nSuch a cable, in the cheapest version that is ok for outdoor use (when protected from direct sun) is ca. 0.50 EUR/m, see https://www.ebay.de/itm/252980614323 . 2x1.5 mm\u00b2 cable is not cheaper (usually 20% more expensive), as it is more rare. It may be possible to use the third wire for communications of some sort. Also 4\u00d70.75mm\u00b2 can be used, but is also more expensive (ca. 0.75 EUR/m). \n\nStill, a house that is 300 m from its neighbor would pay 150 EUR for the cabling, about as much as for the whole rest of the installation. That will probably not pay off. Which means that houses will connect with others if they are within 100 m of their next neighbor. This will result in several \"islands\" within villages, and a commercial operator that intends to buy the excess electricity from the houses would maybe undertake the task to connect some islands together.\n\nCable voltages would be negotiated to be higher in order to have 60 V DC at the large consumer (exact voltages are not relevant at all for all houses, as they have a DC-DC converter and can work with any input voltage, but the large consumer of excess power has none as such a thing would be too expensive). As long as the voltage is kept within safe limits (75 V DC for the EU, 120 V DC for other countries), there are no issues with this approach.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--84\">(84) Plastic sorter for plastic recycling</h4>\n\nA small machine or set of machines for washing, sorting, shredding and perhaps pelletizing plastic trash. The resulting materials can then be sold to other small-scale entrepreneurs, or to large commercial recycling operations. The business idea is is however to produce the sorting equipment, which canthen be used by other entrepreneurs in cities throughout Nepal.\n\nThe machines do not have to be fully automated. Trained humans are also good at recognizing plastic materials, as different products are typically made of different typical plastics.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--85\">(85) Soil production from street dust</h4>\n\nFor example in Kathmandu, several tons of dust can be swept from the streets every day \u2013 the city started doing this in early 2019 using six street broomer machines, but so far they only deposit the dust, to be trucked to the city's usual trash dump.\n\nInstead, the street dust could be taken from there and converted back into soil \u2013 because it is actually fertile soil that was blow away somewhere else.\n\nOf course, the collected dust must be properly cleaned before being used as soil for planting. At minimum, the contained plastic trash and other debris has to be removed with a sieve. Then, the collected dust would be mixed with compost to create proper soil. Afterwards, it would have to be stored long enough (2-3 years) for hazardous germs inside it to die off through competition with soil organisms. During that time, hazardous substances like heavy metals can be extracted (if the soil contains any) by letting water seep through repeatedly and filtering it, and / or with [hyperaccumulator plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperaccumulator).\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--86\">(86) Swale construction</h4>\n\n[Swales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swale_(landform)) (artificial contourline trenches on sloped land) are a simple technique to increase the groundwater table through rainwater infiltration. This can be very useful in Nepal, which has too much water in a part of the year and too little water in the rest of the year. The increased rainwater infiltration would result in new springs and increased spring flow, which can then be used for irrigation purposes.\n\nThe business idea here is to offer swale construction to villages and groups of farmers. The farmers can do the actual digging work, but the consultant would create a plan, provide measuring instruments etc..\n\nOther mechanisms for rainwater infiltration can be added to the portfolio as well, but swales seem especially adapted to terraced land.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--87\">(87) Landfill recycling</h4>\n\nThere are multiple recycling related ideas in this list already, and here is one more, probably the most extreme one:\n\nLandfills are full of recyclable materials. So a company could negotiate free access to a landfill site and set up equipment that allows to dig up landfilled trash and recycle it. Probably, one would use trash that has been in the landfill for multiple years already, as most of the hazardous germs inside it will have died then.\n\nThe goal is to sort and re-use everything:\n\n* sort out individual items that can be upcycled (mirrors, nice glasses, kitchenware, metal objects etc.)\n* sort, shred and pelletize the plastic; burn the plastic (safely) that cannot be reasonably recycled into anything else\n* shred and pelletize the wood as fuel\n* sort and shred the metal parts\n* compost the organic trash and sell the soil (techniques for removing hazardous substances may be needed, see at \"[(85) Soil production from street dust](#heading--85)\")\n* send the electronic components to professional recycling plants; the plastic parts, PCBs etc. would be removed before, reducing the weight and volume by >90%\n\nThe issue to solve is how to provide a safe and comfortable working environment at a cost low enough to keep the idea profitable. 20 ft ISO containers can be put up on-site, with workers on both sides of a conveyor. The conveyor would be covered from the sides and top under glass and workers would reach in through manipulators (holes with strong, safe gloves attached to them). The whole container would be filled with air under a slight overpressure so that no stinky air can get into the room, and the air in the container would be constantly pumped in from 400 - 1000 m away from a location where there is no smell of the trash dump. The containers should also have a nice interior design including plants and connected containers with cots to take a rest from standing (because sitting for work is not good for back health and here difficult anyway due to the conveyor sub-structure). After sorting and washing, the materials would be trucked away to other more specialized companies doing the other steps of the recycling process. Washing water would be treated via sedimentation, sand filters and active carbon filters, and then re-used indefinitely.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--88\">(88) Truffels farming</h4>\n\nInternationally, truffels are an expensive delicacy, and there is a lack of supply of them, mostly because the old techniques of [truffels cultivation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truffle#Cultivation) are not practiced anymore.\n\nYou can however practice that again as a \"guerrilla gardening\" technique: just plant the truffels at the root of wild oak etc. trees, and harvest them when they are ready.\n\nI am not sure if and how many suitable wild trees Nepal has, but as there is a lot of climatic diversity, probably it has suitable trees. Then, this idea could provide a nice income for somebody living in a rural area. And as truffels are probably unknown in Nepal, there is little danger that others will harvest what one planted in the wild.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--89\">(89) Wastewater to soil</h4>\n\nSewage contaminated riverwater, such as that of the Bagmati river, can also be seen as free delivery of fertilizer for agriculture. Because urine and feces are rich in nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus and organic matter.\n\nThe question is how to extract these without also getting too many toxic chemicals at the same time, but the following process would probably work: use a large-scale [slow sand filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_sand_filter) to filter out bacteria, particles, and the nutrients they contain. Scrape off the topmost biofilm-sand layer periodically and replace it with fresh, fine sand (ground from stones on-site). Mix the scraped material with biomass and some soil and let it compost for 2-5 years in protected locations \u2013 it will lose more or less all its live bacteria in the same way as when composting feces, namely because the soil microorganisms outcompete them over time. After that, fertile soil is available for local agriculture. The biomass to mix in is just to increase internal aeration for proper composting \u2013 low-nutrient biomass like wood chips, sawdust, pine needles etc. is fine.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--90\">(90) Notebook remanufacturing</h4>\n\nMore or less everyone who needs it has a smartphone in Nepal already, but far from everyone who would need it has a computer. For example, a notebook can be a great study tool for schools, and also for schoolchildren to have one personally.\n\nThe question is how to provide these computer at very affordable prices. One idea is as follows: let associates in Europe collect old and broken notebook computers in large amounts, and ship them to Nepal as full container loads. Collecting these computers is not much of a difficulty, as they people will just want to get rid of them at the perceived end of their lifetime. But with enough collected notebooks to have multiples of every model, there will be many options to combine still working parts into working computers again. In other cases, simply upgrading the main memory and installing an operating system more adapted to older computers (that is, Linux) will already make a barely functioning computer well usable again.\n\nIt may be estimated that selling such computers for 3000 - 5000 NPR each would be an affordable price for most people who need one now but can't afford it.\n\nIf so desired, it is easily possible to take such a remanufacturing business to more extreme levels by starting to 3D print broken or missing case parts, investing in a reballing and reflow station to fix loose chips (the main mode of mainboard death) and so on. But it remains to be determined which of these ideas can be commercially profitable.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--91\">(91) Photovoltaics kits for household electrification</h4>\n\nA small box containing charge controller and a small LiFePO4 battery. Over the lifetime of the battery, costs per watt is lower than with lead-acid, since it can be used for \u22652000 charge cycles. At the same time, it is safer than LiCoO2 cells, which can however also be used (esp. when harvested for free from notebook accumulators etc.). Instead of cabling, it might be better (more energy efficient) to use headlamps with fast-charging supercaps that can be recharged in 1-2 minutes every 2 hours at a station that includes both the PV panel and buffer batteries.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--92\">(92) Charcoal and electricity production by flash carbonization</h4>\n\nWood fuel is widely used in Nepal fo cooking, and can be completely replaced with charcoal briquets made from waste biomass with the technology explained below. This means that the technology could have a huge potential in Nepal. And since charcoal burns cleaner, it would benefit public health as a side effect.\n\nCurrently, 52% of Nepal's greenhouse gas emissions are created from wood fuel, which is one of the top ten percentages worldwide. Wood is a carbon neutral fuel if it does not result in net deforestation of course. But this also means that by replacing wood fuel with waste biomass, these 52% of saved emissions are now an equal amount of carbon sequestration in standing forests, offsetting Nepal's other half of carbon emissions. It would make Nepal carbon neutral (at least for a time, as sadly LPG and other fossil fuel use is on the rise rapidly).\n\n[Flash carbonization](https://patents.google.com/patent/US6790317) is about 250% as energy efficient than other (modern and efficient) charcoal creation processes, since it yields about 40-50% more charcoal by weight, and also the syngas byproduct can be used to power electricity generators.\n\nFor resources about the flash carbonization process, see:\n\n* [introductory text](https://web.archive.org/web/20150918204046/http://www.hnei.hawaii.edu/node/219) (archive.org version)\n* the (now expired) [patent on the process](https://patents.google.com/patent/US6790317)\n* Michael Jerry Antal, Kazuhiro Mochidzuki, and Lloyd S. Paredes: [Flash Carbonization of Biomass](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ie0301839), with [full-text available](https://datapdf.com/flash-carbonization-of-biomass-american-chemical-society.html)\n* a [closely related paper](https://www.hnei.hawaii.edu/projects/biomass-pyrolysis-constant-volume-reactors) about biomass pyrolysis in constant volume reactors\n\nAny biomass is suitable as input, as even fine charcoal granules can be processed into charcoal briquets by binding them together with an organic glue (for example made from wheat gluten). In Nepal, such a fuel made from dried waste biomass could completely replace wood fuel in villages, while at the same time the syngas from generation can power an electricity generator supplying the village with electrical power.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--93\">(93) Hydrogen as cooking fuel</h4>\n\nUsing excess PV and hydro electricity to create hydrogen from water, put it into pressureless gas bags, and distribute it as cooking fuel in the village, similar to how the \"biogas backpack\" is used now for the distribution of biogas in villages.\n\nThe advantage is, it does not need burning biomass, it is CO<sub>2</sub> neutral and it burns totally clean (allowing indoor use) since the only product is water vapor. It can also be used for technical purposes, incl. goldsmithing, glass shaping and welding.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--94\">(94) Village cinema and Internet caf\u00e9 chain</h4>\n\nOne of the reasons why people in Nepal leave villages is the lack of connection to the outside world and the lack of diversion. Both of that can be fixed to some degree by setting up the tech infrastructure for building small cinemas and Internet caf\u00e9s in villages. These would be operated as a chain of franchise businesses, each by a local person from the respective village.\n\nThe business idea is here to develop the technology needed for such a business operation, to found that chain of businesses, and to obtain a share from the profits of each.\n\nThe \"technology\" for a rural cinema would simply be a hall with a white wall, good speakers and a good video projector. A full library of films can be brought in at the start on hard disks or DVDs, and new films can also be downloaded from a central server over the Internet.\n\nThe screened movies can be entertainment, but would also include practically useful material, for example about new techniques of farming.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--95\">(95) Earthquake-proof indoor shelters</h4>\n\nNepal is always at risk of earthquakes, and a major one is expected west of the 2015 Gorkha earthquake. Houses are not earthquake proof in that area yet and many would lose their lives if the earthquake happens during the night. Replacing the houses with earthquake proof versions is also not an option for people, financially.\n\nHowever, as most houses are single story to 2.5 stories only, an indoor shelter to sleep in would offer enough protection. For a time-tested design proposal, see the [Morrison Shelter](https://www.notechmagazine.com/2019/06/the-morrison-shelter.html). As described there, such indoor shelters can be quite effective: Morrison shelters prevented serious injuries to 120 out of 136 people in a study of 44 bomb damaged houses during World War II.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--96\">(96) Village Internet Service Provider (ISP)</h4>\n\nMany rural areas in Nepal are now sufficiently served with Internet connectivity via the Ncell and NTC mobile networks, and many others will be added in the next years. However, mobile broadband Internet is too expensive for heavy use, and also, the mobile network will not cover all the valleys of Nepal's mountainous landscape even several years from now. This opens the business opportunity to provide low-cost Internet services to villages, similar to how [Mahabir Pun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabir_Pun) went about connecting 50 000 villagers in the Pokhara area to the Internet. But here, it would be a business opportunity.\n\nOne major development that enables this business opportunity is the recent (2020-03) release of an open source, very low-cost (65 USD), solar powered wifi node that can function as a part of a mesh network, routing network traffic at up to 2.6 MiB/s (split equally between sending and receiving direction). It is obviously slower than systems with more CPU power and for wifi distribution among a neighborhood it should be combined with a more powerful wifi router, such as one based on OpenWRT compatible commercial hardware. However, each of these nodes can manage up to 4 wifi connections (two needed when functioning as a forwarding node), and these nodes enable to route wifi between multiple mesh nodes, up and down hills, until reaching the target house or neighborhood.\n\nThe project enabling this is called \"ESP Independent Solar Energy Mesh Node Firmware\". Relevant project links are:\n\n* [webpage](https://www.isems.de/ff-esp32/) (in German \u2013 use automatic translation)\n* [Github repo](https://github.com/ISEMS/ISEMS-ESP32)\n* [project description at a funder's page](https://prototypefund.de/project/espmesh/) (in German \u2013 use automatic translation)\n\nAnother development is that, in 2021, [SpaceX Starlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink) wants to provide global Internet access via satellite. Its ground hardware is expected to be quite complex and could be expensive, at least in the beginning. As for costs of a Starlink based broadband Internet service, the best we can guess right now is that it \"could launch for somewhere around the 80 USD per month mark, plus an extra 100 to 300 USD for installation costs\" [[source](https://www.inverse.com/innovation/spacex-starlink-heres-how-much-it-will-cost-to-subscribe)].\n\nThis means that Starlink would *not* outcompete but rather enable small village ISPs that distribute a Starlink connection around the village with the cheap system discussed above. Namely, the local installation costs would be ca. 100 USD for each service location (an isolated house or small neighborhood). The installation could look like a satellite ground station in the center of a village or in a geographically suitable location for a wifi tower, and then multiple directional wifi connections starting from there, using ESP32 ISEMS nodes, possibly in chains of 3-4 to reach isolated homes and neighborhoods up to 2 km away. Additionally, houses located closer to the satellite ground station can also connect via CAT5 network patch cable for a faster connection. 100 to 300 customers would share one satellite ground station. The ground station can also serve locally stored media files, avoiding some Internet traffic. In total, flatrate Internet access at 1.3 Mbit/s (and much higher when close to the ground station) could be made available for about 500 NPR per month, compared to 8000 NPR per month for an own Starlink connection.", "created_at": "2016-07-02 14:40:15", "updated_at": "2020-10-16 11:57:46.874168", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 23654, "wiki": false, "reads": 37, "score": 134159.4, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [52249], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [32, 2736, 3799, 3791, 2095], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7045, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1093, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>That's very personal!</b>\n\nHi Jonathan, welcome back.

The use of categorization and tagging of the texts would provide the Council of Europe, promoter of the project, with a set of characteristics taken from the community that would, hopefully, help to understand the needs and interests of its members, and that could be up to a certain point extrapolated to the rest of the population.</span>\n\n<span>Truth is, the Edgeryders community is far more than a sample of the European youth, as could be easily noticed in the enormous age range the attendants to the Living on the Edge conference demonstrated. It does seem, however, that what the age categorisation cannot profile is compensated by certain common characteristics shared by many in the community: nonconformists, driven, full of ideas and willing to set up projects based on such ideas, the Edgeryders community is one made up by people that, in many ways, like to really \u201clive on the edge\u201d.</span>\n\n<span>Also, the goal of this session was to present to the community another of the goals of the Edgeryders project: the creation of a transition handbook with recommendations for policy makers.</span>\n\n<span>Development</span>\n\n<span>The presentation of the study based on the Edgeryders site data touched several aspects shared by at least part of the community, of which we can indicate:</span>\n\n<span>- </span><span>Work: </span><span>stances on work and experiences in employment are generally negative, at least in traditional jobs. Many Edgeryders try to either start their own initiatives or use work solely as a way to pay the bills, with personal and skills development occurring outside of work life. Faced with the choice, and with the plummeting employment market around Europe, Edgeryders would rather do the work they like than enter the labour market. There seems to be also a divided perception between work and employment, employment seen as either exploitation or frustration. Work, on the other hand, considered as what one does, is valued in itself. That would explain the preeminence of reports in the platform that talk about projects made by Edgeryders, often for little or no monetary gain, and the small representation traditional jobs get in it.</span>\n\n<span>- </span><span>The life paradigm</span><span>: concern is shown for the conciliation of family life with work, for the diminishing public health care systems and for the likelihood of finding a place to live. Peculiarly, not many reports dealt with pensions or retirement. This can be due to two main reasons: the difficulties in dealing with the present and the youth of most members of the community, which would make the prospect of retirement a long-term concern, and thus of diminished perceived importance.</span>\n\n<span>- </span><span>The perception of institutions</span><span>: the perception of state and public institutions is generally not of a positive note. States as such have far-reaching powers that can affect the life of all citizens, and it is perceived that their decisions tend to curtail initiatives instead of enabling them. Also, public institutions are perceived as out of reach, difficult to communicate and deal with. Access to funding for projects is perceived as overly complicated, slow and often plain inaccessible, and that often the funds end up in the wrong hands. Combined with this there\u2019s a growing political awareness and activism that, however, avoids traditional power structures.</span>\n\n<span>- </span><span>The transition process</span><span>: transitioning to an independent life is complicated, as will be seen below, and the Edgeryders community tackles such transition differently. The main values shown integrity, the unwillingness to sell out and the need for a coherent trajectory, passion, the need to do something one likes, and autonomy, the willingness to go alone when needed.</span>\n\n<span>Another element considered in the profiling is the perceived risks and the responses developed by members of the community.</span>\n\n<span>Of course, a fear to fail in the transition to an independent life is always present. Precariousness is, after all, a very real risk in the work life of young people (and, increasingly, in all age ranges), and both job insecurity and the current socio-economic climate threaten all around.</span>\n\n<span>Exploitation, and the low value attributed to temp jobs and/or internships is another common risk, as the labour market becomes more and more unstable. There is the very real possibility of spending years going from unpaid internship to unpaid internship, or becoming stuck in part-time jobs to pay the bills for a few months at a time, in an endless chain of precariousness.</span>\n\n<span>The criminalisation of some solutions members of the community find (such as occupying spaces, either to live or to develop their projects), and the likelihood of being forced to do something unwanted (such as having to accept low paying jobs forcefully) is another element of concern, and further increases the distrust of members of the community for state structures.</span>\n\n<span>Having a very diversified career path (doing one thing and then a completely different one) makes it difficult to classify the person in a recognisable manner by potential employers, and with that comes the risk of marginalisation. Of course, with that also comes the opportunity of taking one\u2019s own way in life, which may not guarantee security but provides a sense of independence that surely will help in the uncertain future.</span>\n\n<span>As for solutions, the creation of an own form of value, be it via self-employment, the use of alternative currencies or fighting against institutions offering unpaid job positions are quite prominent. Along with it, the support from networks, be they family, friends or otherwise, can facilitate at least part of the financial and material problems Edgeryders face. This is, however, a complicated solution, and often taken as a temporary measure to pass a difficult moment. However, if society\u2019s situation does not improve (and right now it does not quite look like it will) this format of survival will become increasingly long-term, and create risks of its own.</span>\n\n<span>Another solution is the community-based approach. While Edgeryders in general are basically independent and tend to look for problem solving in themselves instead of relying on others, the context in which they develop their careers is seen as a social, quite often global, community of peers. The use of online social networks facilitates the exchange of information, the creation of allies and the participation in common projects from anywhere in the world, and this creates an enormous potential for exponential growth, both for the individual and for the community at large.</span>\n\n<span>Resources-wise, the community bases much of its effort on other people. Allies, and the so-called social capital, are crucial to Edgeryders to carry out their initiatives. Institutions can also be considered potential allies, but of course the generalised mistrust in them must be overcome first.</span>\n\n<span>Learning, the acquisition of skills, is more diverse than ever before, and more polemic than it has ever been. Higher education is seen with a certain reticence, as it is perceived that the skills formal education provides are not those actually useful in the world at large. On the other hand, collaborative learning is seen by institutions and companies with mistrust, while at the same time is the one most likely to produce tangible results and useful skills for an adaptable transition. </span>\n\n<span>Finally, institutional funding to start projects is problematic to access, as projects are often not understood or do not fit in the institutional funding structures.</span>\n\n<span>All this creates an environment where youth in Europe may be highly creative and motivated, but find almost insurmountable complications to realize their dreams and hopes. This is nothing new, in fact, and has happened in prior generations as well, but the lack of an adequate employment infrastructure in current Europe makes the simple dream of getting a job and getting by a practical impossibility. Against this, the response of the Edgeryders community is going on their own and proposing solutions and responses to current problems.</span>\n\n<span>For that, the Edgeryders project, a prototype of society communicating with policy makers will need enabling policy spaces, that is, fora where ideas can be put and real solutions obtained. The community has shown its responsiveness already.</span>\n\n<span>When the idea of the transition handbook was presented, and considering it is still a project in the making, the attendants to the conference immediately proposed co-creating the contents of the book. It stood to reason that, if the contents of the Edgeryders platform had been created by the community, the community should be responsible as well for the contents of the document that would be presented to the policy makers.</span>\n\n<span>How this will end only time will tell, and there is a likely possibility that several transition handbooks appear if the community supports their creation. Knowledge, after all, is there for the taking, and the paths to explore for the future are manifold.</span></b>\n\n<b style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; font-weight: normal; \"><span>What do you think?

The guy was a.. Christian.\u00a0In the same novel: talking about a group of young people, call them silf (Fedayeen): their mission is receiving torture instead of the elderly and sick people and those who lost and those who lost their endurance, can you imagine that the (Fidayeen) were singing under torture: \"O prison darkness come, we love darkness, inevitably after this long night daybreak is coming\"\n\nBy the way altruism is still there and it is main reason why the Syrians in Syria are still alive.\n\nSocial solidarity is in its worst conditions in this war but still can feed the hungry and keeps warm to those who are cold. For example the project of \"grace conversation\"\u00a0in Damascus which provides medicine for thousands of families from excess medication at other families, and also \"maoayed alrahman\"\u00a0which are food tables spent by the Syrians with very high annual cost ( 50 million dollars) in 2014 through all the cities.\u00a0In addition to internal displacement thousands of families are participating with their\u00a0homes and food and many other live examples.\n\nThe shape of our lives makes us one body: we know our relatives, enjoy their joys, get sad for their sadness. The satisfaction of our grandparents is as important as our parents.\n\nThe poor celebrate double in our holidays because of a race for\u00a0goodness, because the concept of \"Eid\"\u00a0in the perception of Islam linked to \"Zakat\"\u00a0which is basically the process of cleansing the money by giving the poor his legitimate right of the money which is 2,5 percent of annual profits in secret.\u00a0If there is no secrecy Allah does not accept it .\n\nAnd many annual grants to the poor some of it linked to time, and some linked to personal events like \"Akika\"\u00a0which is slaughtering two\u00a0rams\u00a0and distributing them\u00a0to the poor when the child is born.\n\nOf course every rule has exception but the united community can overcome it.\n\nEvery citizen has moral responsibilities and he is already indebted to the community.\n\nThere is no perfection of course, being in Europe allows me to discover the value of freedom, human value, accept differences, respect the personal space, working hard. To be precise I have to admit that the western civilization is the mirror which we see the deterioration of our situation through it, and the image we want to be closer to.\n\nThe respect for the human person, the system of rights and duties, which I respected from the first day. But living in the middle east gives you the chance to see the dark face of that world, the military training field I came from taught me to not believe the existing models, the part of relations of states specifically.\n\nI\u2019m talking here about the weapons/arms markets, and other markets based on the dead bodies of other states. Especially after watching the news talking about Aleppo, Mosul \u2026 etc Cheap games to prolong the war, unlimited support for the parties of the conflict, in exchange for contracts and concessions we will know in the future.\n\nTransforming the world into struggles areas to gain wealth, and safe areas to enjoy the wealth.\n\nReligion also had a lion\u2019s share in the misuse and legitimization of wars has nothing to do with religion and history is full of examples. The equation of religion and ignorance had a devastating impact through history and nowadays it is very clear that faith without understanding is more dangerous than earthquakes, with corrupt regimes support hate speech that all you need to have new Libya, and with governments are the direct enemy to their citizens you will have Syria or Iraq if you are lucky , and in order to not equate the killer with the victim, I blame the governments for expanding the circle of ignorance, and put the platforms in the service of semiconductor scientists and intellectuals.\n\nUnder these conditions the best thing you can get to is the Egyptian model, with hungry ignorant people afraid to be like those in Syria or Iraq, governed by fascist goverments.\n\nBut I believe in the communion of civilizations.\n\nThe ashes of war go away by time, and civilization remains.\n\nFor some reason we live short lives, nobody knows the reason more than you, nobody can tell you what is the ideal way of thinking, but for sure at least in the civilized world we can be like ants villages, be single hand for the good of future generations, to get a world does not force you to be a refugee, a world where mankind life in the first consideration, morality and intelligence to regulate relations.\n\nMy message to the reader:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Keep reading</li>\n\n<li>No one has a monopoly on truth, it is somewhere in the middle, I don\u2019t have it, but I have part of it, we complete each other, you and me are pieces of the puzzle.

This means they are more than just deliverables describing a project, event or any work conducted by Edgeryders, rather they have a political element to them - they need to speak on our behalf.  \n\n* TO DO for PM: Shape a compelling brief with the person in the team who is responsible for building the report\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--3\">3.

Writing an Edgeryders Fellowship Report</h2>\n\nAs we are adopting the Fellowship model for collaboration with the opencare and openvillage projects and hopefully the coming projects as well. And as we are collectively learning the documentation is quite important. \n\nSo documenting the Fellowship experience is quite important to keep track of what happened and how to move forward with our next steps. \n\nA good model to follow is this [fellowship report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DVOP6y1bXTuwFoJ44FgpZqQU8857n86h/view?usp=sharing) done by @winnieponcelet on the on his OpenCare fellowship. Feel free to follow, adapt, this structure to fit your own fellowship. \n\nUsually the report should cover the following:\n\n* Introduction to your fellowship/project including a description of your work.\n* The methodology adapted during the Fellowship.\n* Summary of activities done during the Fellowship.\n* Conclusions, recommendations and future steps.", "created_at": "2016-11-11 11:18:18", "updated_at": "2019-03-06 17:01:58.905314", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 617, "wiki": true, "reads": 5, "score": 11.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28076, "user_id": 1941, "topic_id": 2527, "post_number": 11, "raw": "<b>Nice to meet you :) this is my little contribute :)</b>\n\nHi,\u00a0\n\nMy name is Silvia and discovered your company only some days ago (sorry...) following the posts of Mr Alberto Cottica on FB.\n\nHere my ideas about your project (state-of-the-art short analysis followed by proposals)\n\nCompany web site - honestly speaking, it is not so easy to understand your activities giving a look into your web site. I mean: everything is clear explained, but not with an immediate effect. You must have the willing (and the free time) to understand. This is not probably a good feature in the contemporary world where everyone is unfortunately trained to become a customer obtaining everything, including information, in just a second and without any effort. Moreover, generally speaking people first use the web looking for solving their some problems or answering any questions (first web engagement) and only at a later stafe they become inclined to offer or to engaged their capabilities in a project.\n\nProbably it would be necessary to design a new web user journey. Your activities have a really great value, so more and more people must know them!\n\nTwitter - you have 1,732 followers due to 5,213 tweets. Nor a Twitter star, but an ordinary journalist with a \"normal\" visibility on the newspaper has collected about 4,000 followers: one for each of their tweets. Yes, I know, the mere number of followers is not anymore considered a suitable parameter, but it is useful in any case if you consider it together with the engagement level, I mean the number of mentions, RT and \"give and take\". They seem very low for you: I propose to tweet more frequently, to mention some authorities concerning your topics, to also share new about technology or similar collective experiences all over the world. I propose to ask and give followers answers, having conversations with them and frequently suggest to continue their esperience on your web company site, for example. Number of followers and expecially mentions and RT would be measured weekly, a great increase is expected already in the first month.\n\nFacebook - you have page 1,165 likes and very few post likes or comments. A simple page showing only old photos of Milan has collected 78,000 likes with a medium of 300 likes for each photo and (this is more important) at least 15 comments (but also 150) for each photo also. I think this is not impossible for you in a historical time in which one citizen engagement is more and more establishing in many countries of the world. Also here: have conversations with people, ask and answer daily, at any time, sharing photos, new, curiosities, projects, new proposals (competitions or short educational free courses). If the first time they visit a page or a site people can find an answer to their need...they come back to visit more and more and probably at the end they can offer their capabilities to the community.\n\nI think no more budget is necessary...only willing, enthusiasm, empathy...\n\nThat' all :)\n\nTo be honest, I am not a professional social media manager, I am only passionate in this matter, because I think that social media can be a powerful tool for inclusion and democracy.\n\nI am an aerospatial engineer, graduated also in information systems applied to cultural heritage and in archaelogy, but unfortunately no one of these matter could became a job here in Italy. I work in TLC sector an you can find more on me on Linkedin \u00a0(any new contact is warmly welcomed) and on about.me/tedhel (@tedhel)\n\nThank you for your attention, Have a nice afternoon :)\n\nSilvia\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-03-19 14:15:26", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:34.795202", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 640, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13184, "user_id": 62, "topic_id": 1407, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>thank you</b>\n\nwao,thanks for the information...I didn't know there were so many experiments about it.

It is taken from the respective parts of our application to Rockefeller Foundation.</em> <em>Originally written by @Alberto, published here 2014-12-03 by @Matthias.</em>\n\n<h1>Open Ethnographer: Harvesting collective intelligence in online communities</h1>\n\nSubmitted by: \u00a0Edgeryders LbG, August 4th 2014\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">Executive summary</h2>\n\nOpen Ethnographer is a tool for aggregating large-scale online conversations in ways that are scalable and easy to explore. It combines ethnography with network analysis to obtain a new kind of qualitative data analysis, which is augmented by quantitative measures. Its ultimate goal is to extract, in an accountable way, summaries, analyses, proposals and other \u201cwisdom of the crowds\u201d contributions.\n\nOpen Ethnographer is meant both as a contribution to the ongoing debate on collective intelligence and as a tool for immediate use by the Edgeryders community. Our ultimate goal is to make collective intelligence techniques cheap, reliable, open and available to all. We believe this will help unlock the potential of communities and networks of citizen experts to take a much larger share of responsibility in shaping the world we all live in. As well as enable the Rockefeller Foundation to meaningfully interact with networks and communities from whom it can pick up weak signals it would otherwise not have access to.\n\nVery early stage prototyping of some of its component parts have been built and tested, with encouraging results. This proposal is aimed at building a more comprehensive prototype; deploying it in a real-world scenario; and evaluating its performance.\n\nOpen Ethnographer is free and open source.\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">\n\n<a id=\"h.66oz6mdmbir2\" name=\"h.66oz6mdmbir2\"></a>Rationale and context</h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">\n\n<a id=\"h.vkyg3ov8uh7y\" name=\"h.vkyg3ov8uh7y\"></a>The issue</h3>\n\nThe ever-growing complexity of the world we live in is eroding the effectiveness of traditional approaches to intelligence and decision support. Policy makers, businesses and NGOs look with increasing interest to collective intelligence phenomena \u2013 coherent information processing that arises from many-to-many interaction patterns across large numbers of humans, without any central control. These show potential because:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>They can process vast amounts of information,</strong> and reaggregate them into highly coherent structures (compare Wikipedia, OpenStreetMap, StackExchange etc.).</li>\n\n<li><strong>They are much faster and cheaper than competing command-and-control methods.</strong> OpenStreetMap disrupted the multimillion dollar business of map software for GPS navigation in about five years, building a comprehensive \u201cwiki\u201d digital map of Planet Earth that functions as a global commons and is simply better than commercial map data. They did this in their spare time, and with essentially no money \u2013 even now the OpenStreetMap Foundation runs on a budget of less than 100K USD a year.</li>\n\n<li><strong>They carry the promise of bringing democratic legitimacy into expert advice.</strong> Policy makers across the globe are faced with increasingly complex scenarios where many variables intertwine. These scenarios are difficult to map onto the political debate of a modern democracy, which tends to simplify issues. There are very good reasons for this (the simpler the story, the lower the threshold for citizens and media to take part in the debate), but simplification and reductionism are not good tools for decision support when it comes to complex dynamics (think climate change). Expert advice is seen as elitist and unaccountable, and public opinion as unsophisticated and toothless; collective intelligence might fill that gap, allowing citizens to cooperate to generate expert knowledge. The legitimacy in collective intelligence dynamics lies in their openness: anyone can step in and make an edit to Wikipedia or OpenStreetMap. This lends to these processes their attractive ability to self-correct most of their errors, and additional legitimacy as no one is excluded.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThese desirable properties arise from the bottom-up, open, decentralized nature of collective intelligent dynamics. These very same characteristics, however, also make such dynamics unpredictable: most attempts at collective intelligence fail, and those that do succeed are not always easy to interpret. A vibrant conversation about, say, energy, will contain very many opinions, proposals, claims and evidence, both competing and complementing each other. Extracting an executive summary from it can be challenging, and even controversial. This has so far limited the takeup of these methods.\n\nOpen Ethnographer aims to provide an accountable way to extract the highlights from a large-scale online conversation. This happens by\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>Enabling ethnographic research directly on the online platform hosting the conversation.</strong> Ethnographic research starts by \u201ccoding\u201d, i.e. associating snippets of texts related to keywords that are relevant to the problem being studied. This is useful because it builds a link across different texts relating different experiences, opinions or arguments. It groups them under one heading and, allows them to be studied in the context of each other. For example, stories about a graduate student moving to a foreign country to pursue a scholarship, an entrepreneur reporting hiring specialist employees abroad and an unskilled worker seeking fortune in a country other than the one she was born in might all be coded \u201cinternational mobility of labor\u201d. Once all the text in a study has been coded, researchers may call all occurrences of \u201cinternational mobility of labor\u201d to get an idea of how this phenomenon is viewed by different participants in the conversation.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Storing the ethnographic coding on the platform itself, in open format.</strong> This allows anyone to follow the steps of the researchers, and even reproduce their work. This makes such research more accountable.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Processing algorithmically conversations that are very large and unrealistic for human researchers to process in their entirety.</strong> This happens in ways that points to parts of text that are likely to be worth of human attention. For example, network analysis can identify \u201cislands\u201d in the conversation that are widely participated (many people take part) deeply participated (people do, on average, many \u201cpasses\u201d) and well connected (this conversation is participated by people that also participate in other conversations). \u00a0Such islands are likely to yield high quality content, because wide participation is associated to diversity of opinions and experiences; deep participation with \u201cevolution\u201d in the initial positions; connectedness indicates the likely absence of a echo chamber effect.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nOur experience indicates that an\u00a0<strong>open online conversation, augmented by combining quantitative and qualitative data analysis in different ways, has the potential to enable large groups of humans to deliver scenario exploration, risk assessment, blue sky idea generation, thought experiments, fact checking and other types of expert advice</strong>. The operative word is \u201clarge\u201d: these techniques are scalable to a certain extent. As such, they allow us to transcend the size of the workshop room, throwing unprecedented quantities of connected brainpower at difficult problems. Additionally (and, in democracy, critically) they allow for openness (scalability means that anybody can step in at any time without crashing the process), and therefore legitimacy.\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">\n\n<a id=\"h.66vj2io3s981\" name=\"h.66vj2io3s981\"></a>Relevance to Edgeryders</h2>\n\nEdgeryders is a social enterprise that grows out of an online community. We started out as a project engineered by the Council of Europe and the European Commission, who in 2012 set out to contribute to a reform of youth policies in Europe against the backdrop of the financial crisis. To produce that contribution, we assembled an online community of over a thousand young Europeans, who exchanged their experiences and remedial strategies.\n\nOnce the project terminated and the Council of Europe turned off its servers, we engineered a spinoff of the community onto a new platform, and built a social enterprise with the purpose of serving that community and enable its members to leverage each other for their great projects driving social change. Its vision is to sell intelligence and consultancy services produced by open, ad hoc networks of citizen experts rather than by professional consultants. By deploying practitioners and doers as consultants, we tap their situated knowledge; by compensating them, we are able to support their work; by deploying many of them, we ensure that all opinions are voiced and all voices are heard; by openness we make sure the power wielded by consultants is subject to scrutiny and self-correction, since anybody can be a consultant with Edgeryders simply by joining the conversation.\n\nOnline conversations among citizen experts are the main engine of discovery and analysis we employ. Anything that increases the accuracy, depth and accountability of our harvesting techniques is central to our mission.\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">\n\n<a id=\"h.1zprei60wfp0\" name=\"h.1zprei60wfp0\"></a>Related work and advantages of our approach</h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">\n\n<a id=\"h.xx0y3a4u64fc\" name=\"h.xx0y3a4u64fc\"></a>Ethnography</h3>\n\nPractitioners of ethnography (now being rebranded as quantitative data analysis, or QDA) have been using specialized software since before the Internet went mainstream. Most frequently used tools include:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Proprietary and closed: Atlas.Ti, NVivo, MaxQDA and others</li>\n\n<li>Open source but derelict: WEFT-QDA</li>\n\n<li>Open source, still live: RQDA (works on the R platform)</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThese all work on standalone text files (generally arranged in collections). By contrast, we aim to enable ethnographic research and qualitative data analysis in general directly on social networks and other online community websites, starting from ones powered by Drupal, like Edgeryders.\n\nThe advantages of our approach over the current one are:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>It preserves the rich metadata of the text. Who wrote that particular piece of text? Was it a he or a she? When? Where? What else did the same person contribute to the conversation? And to other conversations? With existing QDA software, this information is lost, unless the researcher keeps manually track of it \u2013 not a realistic strategy for most projects, and in fact a strategy that does not get used.</li>\n\n<li>It drives cost further down. Our approach removes the need for maintenance of the database of ethnographic data as a separate activity: the online community website\u2019s main database does double duty for QDA purposes.</li>\n\n<li>It allows reuse, comparison and reshare. The same data can be annotated (\u201ccoded\u201d in QDA parlance) by different researchers on different projects. Each coding is saved in the same database as everything else on the online community website. Further, a researcher\u2019s coding can, if the researcher herself so wishes, be shared with other researchers for feedback, or even saved under a different name and improved upon. In other words, it allows for QDA to be open, and coding data to be released as open data. This has desirable consequences in terms of accountability of the results (they can be reproduced), methodological transparency (the intermediate steps to get from the data to the conclusion are encoded in the codings, which are saved in open format), scope for collaboration (researcher A can copy the codings of researcher B, then edit and improve that copy), scope for the emergence of \u201cprosumer ethnographers\u201d (with cheap, simple software and data people can do ethnography without being full-time professional ethnographers), Wikipedia-style self-correcting properties.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nSituated data are simpler and cheaper to \u201cremix\u201d into new, hybrid analysis techniques. Some examples:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>network analysis combined with ethnography:</strong> allows to identify the more central (and presumably authoritative) individuals in the conversation network, and give more weight to the positions they express in the debate.</li>\n\n<li><strong>sentiment analysis:</strong> looks for positive (like \u201copportunity\u201d or \u201cevolution\u201d), negative (like \u201cchallenge\u201d or \u201cfailure\u201d) and neutral (like \u201cGermany\u201d or \u201ctools\u201d) keywords; counts how many time they occur; and computes a measure of the general mood of the conversation.</li>\n\n<li><strong>natural language analysis combined with ethnography:</strong> allows to pre-process very large conversations through natural language analysis, a scalable but blunt technique based on counting the occurrences of each word in a piece of text, and only deploy ethnography (more sophisticated, more expensive) on its subset that reveals interesting patterns.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>The data structure we propose not only enables better ethnography as we know it today; it paves the way to new types of analysis that we have not even invented yet.</strong>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">\n\n<a id=\"h.h4a8ry7boybn\" name=\"h.h4a8ry7boybn\"></a>Network analysis</h3>\n\nThe rise of network science has given rise to the deployment of new tools for analysing graphs. The most widely used are called Pajek, Gephi, Tulip and NetworkX. These are desktop applications that require (1) data already in network format and (2) a sophisticated understanding of network science. Analysis is performed by applying algorithms to the raw data and interpreting their results. This requires agility in manipulating data so that the application can crunch them, and familiarity with network mathematics.\n\nOur approach does not aim to replace those tools. Rather we \u201cbottle\u201d them into pre-selected routines and provide guidelines to interpreting their results. This happens in the data collection and organization phase; in the computation phase; and in the interpretation phase.\n\n<strong>Data collection</strong> and organization\u00a0requires a server side application that extracts the data from the platforms hosting the online conversation, where they are typically stored in tabular form, and reaggregate them in network form.\n\n<strong>Computation</strong>\u00a0requires performing only those computations that are deemed essential to the analysis of online conversations (and, not, for example, of those more useful to analyzing transport networks).\n\nFinally, <strong>interpretation</strong>\u00a0requires showing the user an interface that provides guidelines to what the results of the computation might mean. For example, the user might see a message like this: \u201cNetwork modularity is 0.45. This metric measures the distance of the observed network from a random network with the same number of nodes and links. A modularity value above 0.3 there is significant structure in the conversation. Can you spot groups? What do you think is pulling together the members of each group? Is it a common interest that makes them discuss the same topic? Is it nationality?\u201d In other words, network analysis is used to make researchers (and ordinary participants) aware of the conversation\u2019s structure, and provides hints as to what that mathematical structure might mean in social terms.\n\nThe challenge is twofold. On the one hand, it is tricky to provide web-based interfaces with enough interactivity to be meaningful, but not so much as to be overwhelming for a user that has a basic understanding of networks but is not a network scientist. On the other hand, it is quite hard to translate the mathematical abstractions into social terms without making reference to a network in particular! Such translations need to be fairly general so that the software can be used in many different situations and for many different conversations.\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">\n\n<a id=\"h.6ygrsjgi18r\" name=\"h.6ygrsjgi18r\"></a>Project vision and activities</h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">\n\n<a id=\"h.qs9k1vigut4a\" name=\"h.qs9k1vigut4a\"></a>Scope</h3>\n\nWe will develop a web-based ethnographic software, that, as a unique feature, exhibits its data in a standard format called RDFa. This format was developed for semantic web applications: it allows any computer program anywhere on the Internet that knows the format to interact with the data in a very precise way, allowing them to be combined with any other data. This, in turn, allows unforeseen uses (an example of data from different sources interacting is Twitter data combined with map data to generate a new object \u2013 a map of the global Twitter conversation) \u2013 especially by researchers, the open data community and semantic search engines. Specifically, coding a post with Open Ethnographer will write information about the keywords associated with that post in the HTML code of the web page containing the post. This is invisible to the human reader, but acts like a beacon to any program, anywhere on the web, that is looking for that particular keyword in that particular format. This also works the other way around: the researcher using Open Ethnographer will be able to search the semantic web for other conversations using the same keyword in that format, and is no longer limited to the data encoded on her own platform. She could do this in search of additional data, or to compare her results with those of other colleagues interested in similar issues. Imagine retrieving all pieces of text containing both the codes \u201cyouth unemployment\u201d and \u201cPoland\u201d, ordering them by date and writing a piece of original research that shows how the way respondents in ethnographic research work talk about youth unemployment over time.\n\nWe aim to test-run some of these applications; however, we don\u2019t aim to integrate full-fledged semantic network analysis into Open Ethnographer at this stage of its development.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">\n\n<a id=\"h.gn6b5wk10cq0\" name=\"h.gn6b5wk10cq0\"></a>Activities</h3>\n\nThe project is at a pre-alpha stage. A rough prototype has been deployed on http:// edgeryders.eu , and used to do actual consultancy work with organisations such as UNDP. The prototype reuses certain features Drupal\u2019s Rich Text Editor to assign codes to selections of text. Such codes are stored in the HTML code, but only shown visibly to privileged users (eg. researchers).\n\n<em>Figure 1: The Open Ethnographer prototype. Researchers select a snippet of text and assign it a code from the menu on the top left. Snippets are bracketed by color-coded triangles</em>\n\nAdditionally, Edgesense supplies a near-real time simple social network analysis of the conversation.\n\nThis prototype does work for coding and does preserve the metadata, but it lacks many essential features. In this project we will:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>Build a quotation manager</strong>\u00a0for inspection of the content. This is the set of features that, after the coding is complete, can show the researcher all contexts in which the same tag (for example \u201csolar energy\u201d) appears.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Build a code manager</strong>\u00a0allowing users to merge tags and arrange them in a hierarchy to make sense of the many conversations happening between members on the platform. This collection of features facilitates the coding phase, when it is not yet clear what is important in the conversation. Imagine a conversation about renewable energy. A researcher could initially tag every mention of solar energy as \u201csolar energy\u201d, but further down the road decide that she wants to distinguish between photovoltaic and thermosolar. She proceeds to create two new codes, \u201cphotovoltaic\u201d and \u201cthermosolar\u201d and saves them as children codes of the parent code \u201csolar energy\u201d.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Build a solution for different users to code the same online content in parallel.</strong>\u00a0Researcher A should be able to do her own tagging of the written material, or to duplicate the tagging already done by researcher B, save it under a different name and improve upon it.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Test ways to combine social network analysis with the semantic coding,</strong> with a view to future integration.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Run a full test of the tool.</strong> Specifically, we will use it to analyze the online conversation around stewardship of public goods, which is to be the theme of Living On The Edge 4 (see above). This event will entail a lot of discussion about the theme, before, during, and after the fact; most of it will live on the Edgeryders platform. An ethnography of stewardship done with Open Ethnographer will be an excellent test not only that the program runs in a technically correct way, but also that it produces relevant results on the field.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">\n\n<a id=\"h.zcqa2uhfjxww\" name=\"h.zcqa2uhfjxww\"></a>Broader impact</h2>\n\nOpen Ethnographer is part of the global shift towards the development of open collective intelligence tools that enable any organisation to use ethnography as a tool for sense making in online networks. Many thinkers in the collective intelligence community think most of its impact comes from deploying additional brainpower towards solving the world wicked problems. Ethnography\u2019s added value is that it is a research method that encodes the point of view of the individuals being studied. Ethnography brings great value added to a modern society:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Trend detection by wisdom of crowds.</strong> By virtue of focusing on communities, ethnography is good at detecting the weak signals of social, economic and cultural trends in the making.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Stakeholder mapping.</strong> By encoding the point of view of the group being studied, it delivers a detailed, empathetic mapping of the incentives and constraints that group is facing. This makes it easier to predict the group member\u2019s behavior in the face of a change in their environment.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nEthnographic research is applied across many disciplines, for pure research as well as for business purposes. A particularly interesting application is that to the design of public policies. Because:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Trend detection helps in building early warning monitoring systems. This is very valuable in modern societies, where the pace of societal, economic and cultural change is greatly accelerated \u2013 whereas the policy cycle typically is not.</li>\n\n<li>Detailed and empathetic stakeholder mapping helps prevent cross-veto deadlocks of public policy. In open societies, many actors wield veto power; this is unavoidable and even desirable, but it does tend to reduce the effectiveness of public policy (like in NIMBY syndrome cases).</li>\n\n<li>Ethnography has an additional advantage to the policy maker: the <strong>democratic legitimacy</strong>\u00a0that comes from acknowledging the values and perspective of a diverse range of stakeholders.</li>\n\n<li>In Edgeryders deployments, <strong>openness</strong>\u00a0ensures transparency and accountability in public policy consultancy.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThe overall impact of Open Ethnographer is increase the cognitive reach and the political weight of spontaneous aggregations of citizen experts, over those of businesses, governments and other formal organizations.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-08-03 22:00:00", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:23.446969", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 3744, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 6.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3922, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 3889, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n\n\u00a0\n\nfile_fid:3927 -", "created_at": "2014-11-10 14:18:36", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:21.574565", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 6, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8466, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 6243, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Way to go!</b>\n\nNo idea... but I am very happy you guys are doing this. :-)\n\n", "created_at": "2017-04-27 17:22:33", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:48.960873", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 19, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3310], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21352, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 3585, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Quick question</b>\n\n@Ben, any news on the conf curators confirmed?

The main idea was to identify first if and how a Twitter \u201cconversation\u201d around a hashtag can form a community?\n\nOne of our assumptions is that we can find that there are lots of isolated components in a Twitter hashtag stream, with people not really calling out to each other, whereas \"tight\" online community gives rise to a giant component that most of the nodes are connected to. Can we confirm that from a data perspective?\n\nAnother assumption is that people could easily form subgroups investigating specifics, and how we can find traces of, or understand the content gathering these subgroups?\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">The data &amp; context</h2>\n\nTo that purpose, we have analyzed twitter data made available during the MoN3 event.\n\nBut before talking about the data itself, we may mention some contextual information on how this data has been captured.\n\nThis data represents Tweets collected between 18/10/2014 and 23/02/2015, this data has been gathered from the search query \u201c#lote4 OR edgeryders OR unmonastery OR Matera\u201d by <a href=\"/u/piersoft\">@piersoft</a>\u00a0using <a href=\"https://mashe.hawksey.info/2011/11/twitter-how-to-archive-event-hashtags-and-visualize-conversation/\">TAGSExplorer</a>.\u00a0\n\nLote4 stands for <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/112143480\">Living On The Edge</a>, a conference organised by the Edgeryders global community which took place in Matera (Italy) between the 23rd and the 26th of October 2014. The unMonastery was an artist and hacker residency program that Edgeryders ran in Matera during most of 2014; the Lote4 conference happened in the unMonastery building and with the help of the unMonastery events. The search string was expected to catch all tweets around the event taking place in Matera and their follow up over subsequent months.\n\nOrganizing the event, we expect authors such as Edgeryders and Matera2019 to be sort of moderators of the event, and to engage other twitter users from their own networks in driving conversations among the different participants.\n\nThe collection is composed of about 20k Tweets written by 7000 people involving another 1000 additional people (via mentions or RTs).\n\nThe data has information on who sends a Tweet, eventually whom the Tweet is sent to, who is mentioned in the Tweet, the date and which hashtag has been used.\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">The notion of community</h2>\n\nWe need to step back a bit here and question ourselves on what makes a community a community. Social network scientists such as myself have preconceived established notions of what makes a community in terms of data analysis, but they all end up being empirical and somewhat fitting well in the boots of data analysis. Two main definitions might be recalled, the first one would come from Manski, for whom the group effect builds from gathering people alike (translated in data processing this would mean similarity of attributes). The second definition is used as a support to compute the Newman\u2019s modularity, states that a community has much more relationships between members within itself than with other members from outside the community. Discussions led by our panel of experts has pushed even further the different definitions of the notion of community.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried to bring different perspectives on the notion of community, by asking these questions \u00a0\u201cwhat does it mean to be a community? what does it mean to belong to a community? what does it mean to look at a community?\u201d.\n\nWe gathered many answers which faceted a bit the notion of \u201ccommunity\u201d, into three main categories, and we\u2019ve also discussed some other interesting characteristics of communities.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:0pt;\">\n\n<table style=\"border:none;border-collapse:collapse;width:624px\">\n\n<colgroup>\n\n<col width=\"*\">\n\n<col width=\"*\">\n\n<col width=\"*\">\n\n</colgroup>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr style=\"height:0px\">\n\n<td style=\"border-left:solid \\#000000 1px;border-right:solid \\#000000 1px;border-bottom:solid \\#000000 1px;border-top:solid \\#000000 1px;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\n\n<span><span>Awareness</span></span>\n\n</td>\n\n<td style=\"border-left:solid \\#000000 1px;border-right:solid \\#000000 1px;border-bottom:solid \\#000000 1px;border-top:solid \\#000000 1px;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\n\n<span><span>Exchanging/discussion</span></span>\n\n</td>\n\n<td style=\"border-left:solid \\#000000 1px;border-right:solid \\#000000 1px;border-bottom:solid \\#000000 1px;border-top:solid \\#000000 1px;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\n\n<span><span>Action</span></span>\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr style=\"height:0px\">\n\n<td style=\"border-left:solid \\#000000 1px;border-right:solid \\#000000 1px;border-bottom:solid \\#000000 1px;border-top:solid \\#000000 1px;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\n\n<span><span>Sense of belonging/endeavor</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>inner sense of belonging</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>sharing of interest</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>some commonalities</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>publish on similar twitter hashtag</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>gather around specific goal</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>share content</span></span>\n\n</td>\n\n<td style=\"border-left:solid \\#000000 1px;border-right:solid \\#000000 1px;border-bottom:solid \\#000000 1px;border-top:solid \\#000000 1px;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\n\n<span><span>People talking to one another</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>exchange in the community (both ways)</span></span>\n\n</td>\n\n<td style=\"border-left:solid \\#000000 1px;border-right:solid \\#000000 1px;border-bottom:solid \\#000000 1px;border-top:solid \\#000000 1px;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\n\n<span><span>follow the same people / sign petition</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>actually meet / community of practice</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>people who do more than what they need to/have to</span></span>\n\n<span><span>behavior, </span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>can be negative engagement</span></span>\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr style=\"height:28px\">\n\n<td colspan=\"3\" style=\"border-left:solid \\#000000 1px;border-right:solid \\#000000 1px;border-bottom:solid \\#000000 1px;border-top:solid \\#000000 1px;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\n\n<span><span>Other characteristics</span></span>\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr style=\"height:28px\">\n\n<td colspan=\"3\" style=\"border-left:solid \\#000000 1px;border-right:solid \\#000000 1px;border-bottom:solid \\#000000 1px;border-top:solid \\#000000 1px;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\n\n<span><span>groups = set of people</span></span>\n\n<span><span>transversal to existing organization</span></span>\n\n<span><span>classes of communities hierarchical</span></span>\n\n<span><span>over time can fuse or divide</span></span>\n\n<span><span>somebody who\u2019s not in the community (the rest of the world)</span></span>\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n</div>\n\n<span><span>Table 1 - Summary of different characteristics a community can have</span></span>\n\nOur experts have extracted 3 levels that define a community from this point:\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>the awareness</li>\n\n<li>the exchanges/discussions</li>\n\n<li>the action/actual engagement</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">Community in Twitter</h2>\n\nThe next step is to reconnect these notions of a community with evidences we can find in the data. In other words, what does \u201cawareness\u201d, \u201cexchanges\u201d and \u201cengagement\u201d mean in the context of Twitter publications?\n\nIn the world of Twitter, someone\u2019s awareness can be measured by the semantics these people use, i.e. the hashtags they use in publishing so we can measure how often these keywords appear, the number of other users who relate to the same semantics, and the presence of our users and their posts on different platforms.\n\nSharing and exchanging between users is the basic purpose of such a micro blogging platform. This type of interaction can be represented in the world of Twitter by mentioning somebody or replying to somebody: it never means that an actual engaging conversation is going on, but it initiates potential collaboration.\u00a0\n\nOther measures can be of interest in tracing the interactions within a community (well, when the community is defined already). The number of connections (following, followers) of a user, their amount and frequency of posting, and the impact of the posts: how do others in the community endorse the posts? does it generate spin offs? all within the community, and out of the community? How to measure this impact? of each post? of each individual?\u00a0\n\nThe network of practice in the material engages people in meeting and actually doing things together, working toward a common goal. We could find traces of physical presence, at events for example, of people from the geocoding, the hashtags they use, when related to an event, or via cross platforms activities such as FourSquare. Unfortunately these indications are not really reliable when confined to the sole Twitter information. Engagement on Twitter can take different shapes, it can mean reciprocal interactions, with the production of content and maybe some spin off actions. One reliable action on Twitter is the construction of actual conversation between people, meaning people replying to one another, reciprocally not only broadcasting information, or commenting on shared interest but real conversations.\n\nAmong the other characteristics of a community discussed, the most interesting would probably be the influence of time on the group evolution (fusing/dividing), but we\u2019ll keep these aspects for a different analysis.\n\nNotice that we have yet taken the \u201cRT\u201d or \u201cretweet\u201d relationship out of the picture as it is a versatile information. This action is the easiest and most represented action of the Twitter universe. The act of retweeting can bear two different meanings. It first helps showing your interest, people retweeting similar posts are show similar awareness, but it can be either positive or negative engagement. The number of retweets can weighs actually the tweets, because when a tweet has been retweeted a lot can be considered as \u201cimpactful\u201d or just popular.\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">The analysis</h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">General analysis of the Twitter data</h3>\n\nSo the dataset is composed of ~20,000 tweets gathered from the query string \u201c#lote4 OR edgeryders OR unmonastery OR Matera\u201d between 18/10/2014 and 23/02/2015, published by ~7,000 different authors, involving 8,000 people including mentions and replies, and referring to over 6000 hashtags.\n\nHere is the production of tweets, we can clearly see a few activity peaks around the event, first during the period of preparation, before the actual event, then during the event.\n\nThe tweets also peak around half November, and more activity can noticed between the end of December and the beginning of January.\n\n<span><span><img alt=\"image\" height=\"141px;\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/wDakLa_PBrbhaLEVwQewwVoU6bOpbwtIHGcwfmReIR27n_wKDOdNJw7DNPWB5nGoCCRT5HCi_InHfo5F8PpZxbsP9r-x94m1-QP2EF-GazQovZpkCv6ElXeWx65LnqraJKeUZKo\" style=\"border: none; transform: rotate(0.00rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad);\" width=\"624px;\"></span></span>\n\n<span><span>Figure 2 - The production of tweets over the period of capture</span></span>\n\nAmong the 7000 authors, only 42 have produced over 50 tweets in the period of time, and 18 users have only retweeted information, about 850 more have published over 5 tweets in this period of time (and actually 200 are only retweeting information).\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span><img alt=\"image\" height=\"143px;\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/PXuFuR3EKDx6ZpBvWqWuXlvd52sV3l2FFSexxq_DEZslDMqyOI7nnb4lTGykiLznbL9N_S-hieg52BQLqKq2YjGPaeCrA9N4iRy3msE--iXoGvWUSvICJfa3PvmbUeFIgib4w8Q\" style=\"border: none; transform: rotate(0.00rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad);\" width=\"624px;\"></span></span>\n\n<span><span>Figure 3- Occurrence of hashtags over time.

Because we\u2019re looking for the strongest evidences of \u201ccommunal\u201d behaviors between twitter users, we advanced quick towards traces of engagement between users. We have therefore considered first the \u201creply\u201d relationship between users, and we\u2019ve drilled down to only 500 of the 2100 users who are actually replying to each other in a big conversation (1600 are involved in small conversations).\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span><img alt=\"image\" height=\"553px;\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/WQ9Mr4y3nM7CSw9vUblAXghHugkQ9euwuK6UxnbxWybHM7Z-GKvRocSCZ2mDTpjy5uU5TkhDTU-CLJGKCNOsC_lN7k0N0v5CGIxwk8pzLp9-6PjK_rKOu3kpITbkI4sRyxrtyiE\" style=\"border: none; transform: rotate(0.00rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad);\" width=\"624px;\"></span></span>\n\n<span><span>Figure 6 - 500 users replying to each other.

We can step back and look at how the different twitterers do at mentioning each other.\n\n1500 people actually mention each other in a connected way. Among these 1500 people, only 100 form a core of reciprocal mentions between each other\u2019s, i.e. people acknowledging each other.\n\n<span><span><img alt=\"image\" height=\"190px;\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/uJg_nG19BnJ3G3UQ-qDKlabUzcDdPk1bDl9MsJJCf6Yn8aXu3DmazgqPIAomDRoKDXrhHir-9xswITtkEApBlraywDiwQxtoMvprPHNdSv5FqATLm4cz5YrGCDbedntHiTsWHWU\" style=\"border: none; transform: rotate(0.00rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad);\" width=\"207px;\"></span><span><img alt=\"image\" height=\"189px;\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/MgfBRrRB1Z6x2LMYxCcKfvyjIrV-Czjrb6nntEmeKG2CQ62F8bFH1rEvhK7ciKat8oUkUd-XP6XDbp0aGSnYbSJorM7CeAqH1FlI-x4GOgW6zQ6mPE3GG4IFJOEb6iMAUVCHVyg\" style=\"border: none; transform: rotate(0.00rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad);\" width=\"194px;\"></span><span><img alt=\"image\" height=\"189px;\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/7vNEMRFeGhVmgGtpXb67yh3H6U3hGXEHirMvX6wd0_PYLKKxAKj_qhR3Ow8kBXNsCMcGqsVsZwt3-SUpD85z9aFCR3a7U55W9jVUibMX6DtSpyapvic8YaFAyMabjUz_FYVgLDI\" style=\"border: none; transform: rotate(0.00rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad);\" width=\"179px;\"></span></span>\n\n<span><span>Figure 9 - Two consecutive mesmerizing zooms on 1500 people mentioning one another in an intricate conversation.</span></span>\n\nNow it is interesting to see how the core two communities we have previously identified collaborate with one another.

We can focus on what they interact about.\u00a0\n\nThe idea is to compare the semantic space in which the individual exchange when they discuss together. Is it different from how they mention each other? and how? and what brings them together.\n\nTo do so, we have built a different network, it\u2019s actually a network in which links materialize the hashtags exchanged between two users. It has the same flat topology as the previous network of people, but it is rich of the semantics that people use when they converse.\n\n<span><span><img alt=\"image\" height=\"378px;\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/jeG3zG69gkoRAhB0WvfVCq3_z9di6USSDMmN5XTgDC7lm6F-cZUBa_kYAhIrdEJYrX_X2KcR6WC2yWrsne7c5BOi3ra2nsLbeknQEJSG996KRseq4_xgtqHQVbElXm9fAmTbTjc\" style=\"border: none; transform: rotate(0.00rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad);\" width=\"623px;\"></span></span>\n\n<span><span>Figure 12 - Illustrative example of associated selection between people (left) and hashtags (right) with detangler to promote exploratory network analysis.</span></span>\n\nUsing this model, we can capture the schemes of conversations and see how hashtags bring the two sub-communities together.\u00a0\n\nIf we limit ourselves to the semantics of engaged conversations, very little is bringing the two communities together but \\#ecoc2019. The interest of each community are clearly identified and separated. One group is really focused on travels in Matera, whereas the second group is centred around the Lote4 event, transfer and openness.\u00a0\n\n<span><span><img alt=\"image\" height=\"422px;\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/1rAgvSw3TItuIb9OLqHFTM8k_j4vmUERe9DA5SlCsdkxu0B66UUdir_yEhyjUstbxJIzfFB2NC4_7YFBIURIYz5M2wjI0_olEP6L-qAXzbh0e8DeEguXXEak9-mliFuhf5AkgUw\" style=\"border: none; transform: rotate(0.00rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad);\" width=\"630px;\"></span></span>\n\n<span><span>Figure 13 - Communities of people replying to each other.

In other words, the sub-community centered on Edgeryders is more cohesive because people discuss more often about the same focused topics. Could it be an interesting side-effect of an effective moderation? Or could it be that semantic cohesion makes a community really a community?\n\n<span><span><img alt=\"image\" height=\"366px;\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Qh502upD9QT-oQZIvn2FKotWGNvWxVm541s0fbHEUH0CMO5cQljGhT_ZmJgBAVNdm_wHmreb1wfC5fSlD7fl7nt4sAz6vfIU5dxZCLf8HqIY8Sa8c2l-aK84MAoMTSL8jZnXMWU\" style=\"border: none; transform: rotate(0.00rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad);\" width=\"611px;\"></span></span>\n\n<span><span>Figure 13 - Communities of people mentioning each other.

But it is a nice example how we can dig effective elements of discussions, topics of interests, and central people, at the heart of a very noisy spread Twitter conversation.\n\nAlso, considering the context of the event it would make sense to filter the data after, the end of November. Later tweets refer to Matera or to the unMonastery, but at this point the two terms no longer refer to a unity. There also could be many other questions, focused on data properties but also wider openings: How would we compared and define that with annother community, such as Imagination4People\u2019s mailing list / communities? What is the specific role of these [put-your-list-here] individuals? What were their focus of attention during [put-your-timeframe-here]? etc. etc.\n\nNow that we know all these tools and metrics are available, the most challenging task would be to set a (Cartesian) method to systematize and build integrated tools for the analysis of such a Twitter community. Here are some examples ways of applying this to the real world:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Showing the graphs on events to demonstrate which were the main topics tweeted during the day and which people were most active - this implies that the graphs are developed rather quickly</li>\n\n<li>You can identify people who are especially interested in specific topics, at least if mentioning the topic in \\# is a good indicator for this</li>\n\n<li>Really cool would be if this could be used instantly on a twitter wall during events</li>\n\n<li>By reducing the overall number of members of a community to the very few (18 in this case) really active ones, you know who you would need to approach for future events, discussions etc. &gt; find the champions</li>\n\n<li>As it comes down to few topic \\# on our graph, we might be able to encounter new emerging topics or other unexpected stuff</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">Development</h2>\n\nAll the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3qYgN-9xWcoRDJxQ2V3SUhDTkk&amp;authuser=0\">data</a> is made open from the Masters of Networks 3 <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3qYgN-9xWcoRDJxQ2V3SUhDTkk&amp;authuser=0\">drive</a>.

As we are learning, by working the <a href=\"http://nyccli.org/\">New York City Community Land Initiative (NYCCLI)</a>, a community land trust is a non-profit organization that owns property, traditionally land, and leases it for truly affordable housing, local businesses, and non-profit initiatives. The deed to the land, the CLT by-laws, and the lease all require that the housing be permanently affordable. The land can never be traded or sold to the highest bidder on the private market.\n\nI am excited about the importance of community land trusts and worker cooperatives as living examples of resilient institutions that keep individuals in dialog over time and create jobs for underemployed creative people. I am inspired by <a href=\"http://catalystreview.net/%202014/02/fourth-arts-block-leading-cultural-advancement-in-new-york-city/\">Fourth Arts Block</a> and <a href=\"http://3bbrooklyn.com\">3B</a> as examples of just, democratic, and sustainable examples of solidarity economies that will remain stable options for future generations because the land is held in trust.\n\nI built out and co-managed an 8,000 square foot studio space for 40 artists from 2008-2013 off the L train, but our 5-year lease is up. I know what I'm getting in to. I still want more collective spaces! I would love to talk to philanthropists who are interested in taking land out of real estate speculation, for the long haul, to support resilient neighborhood culture and civic engagement.\n\nCaroline Woolard (@carolinewoolard)\n\nMember, http://NYCTBD.com and http://bfamfaphd.com\n\nCo-Founder, http://ourgoods.org, http://tradeschool.coop, http://solidaritynyc.org\n\n", "created_at": "2014-10-08 08:56:21", "updated_at": "2017-10-02 10:17:19.185441", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 464, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1935], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19501, "user_id": 1584, "topic_id": 5132, "post_number": 11, "raw": "We can go for 30g/person.

Different from the existing Annotator tagging interfaces, it should only be possible to add <em>one</em> tag per annotation. Because this simplifies the logic of \"what tags (private or public) to show to whom\" to \"what annotations to show to whom\". It has no adverse side effects as selecting the same text again to tag it with another tag is handled gracefully by Annotator already, incl. viewing the multiple annotations on-hover and deleting any one of them with one click.\n\n<strong>This is a paid task and welcome to be picked up by Edgeryders community members!</strong>\n\n<strong>Implementation languages:</strong> JavaScript, HTML, CSS\n\n<strong>Budget:</strong> 400 EUR for basic task, 200 EUR for add-on task of on-the-fly tag generation and syncing (<a href=\"/t/implement-tagging-in-annotator-with-realtime-tag-filtering/3942/8\">see</a>)\n\n<strong>Collaboration:</strong> Delivery should be as a Github pull request to <a href=\"https://github.com/edgeryders/annotator\">edgeryders/annotator</a>.

Again like you, I did this out of constructive concern for the project. That said, my concerns are going in a different direction from yours. Why? Three reasons.\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>Low expectations</strong>. I agree with [Nadia]: nobody promised a smooth ride, ever. Phrases like \"we have no solutions, but we are committed\" and \"are you ready to be challenged?\" (the latter on the residency application form itself) are all over the place. We made plenty of mistakes: for example, we overestimated the number of applications, and had to reopen the call. We will make more. In fact, t<span>he un</span><span>Mo</span><span>nastery may well be unfeasible and economically unsustainable. We don't know: that's why we are doing a prototype. I work on it because I choose to take a leap of faith in the part of the Edgeryders community that dreamed up the unMonastery back at LOTE1.\u00a0</span></li>\n\n<li><strong>You can always criticize anything on the basis that is not clear enough</strong>. Try it: it is a very powerful rhetorical weapon. It always works, because it is loaded with\u00a0circular reasoning, and so is\u00a0not disprovable.\u00a0If I say you are not being clear, there is no way you can escape. You can very well say that you\u00a0are being\u00a0clear by some standards, but my critique is about you not being clear <em>to me</em> \u2013 and I am the only judge of\u00a0what is clear to me and what is not. So, I can torpedo any argument by saying it's not clear (and in fact this is a common tactics in power games in larger, bureaucratic organizations).\u00a0There are tens of pages on the unMonastery and Edgeryders websites, from [Marc]'s solar panel\u00a0instructables to my own musings on St Benedict's Rule. We published the budget online.\u00a0We have tried to explain it to everyone and their horse, including journalists from HuffPost, Wired, CheFuturo, the Guardian, Corriere and others I don't even remember now. We have run two open workshops in Matera before LOTE3.\u00a0[Sam Muirhead] has\u00a0done two videos. A dozen edgeryders from all over the continent\u00a0have translated one of them in ten languages. What does it take to be clear? This thing is new and difficult to understand. I don't think anyone can fix that, except by\u00a0running with it, seeing where it goes and looking at it with disenchantment and a clean heart.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Who does the work calls the shots</strong>. It also applies to being clear: if you think this could be made better, make a suggestion, or better still... make it better!\u00a0I \u2013 and [Ben], I am sure \u2013 will be glad to help as much as I can.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nMy concerns are: (a) the interface with public institutions (the Region and the City, shareholders in Comitato Matera 2019) is very, very gritty. We knew that before. But it is: gritty, and slow,\u00a0and frustrating to deal with. And (b) some ideas and great work might be lost \u2013 including your\u00a0own work, which I admire. I personally insisted with [antonioelettrico] that everything furniture should be cheap and lightweight, made with the idea to be discarded or recycled into something better by unMonasterians themselves (including, hopefully, you): this has been the compromise we pursued between flexibility and prepping the building so that it is ready for people to live in two weeks \u2013 and the prepping has to be done by non-unMonasterians, because the unMonasterians have not arrived yet.\u00a0\n\nOne final word: Edgeryders LBG is\u00a0<em>not</em> getting paid for this. We have a memorandum of understanding with Comitato Matera 2019 which states explicitly that our partnership does not constitute commercial exchange, and no money changes hands. The residency money is passed entirely on to the unMonasterians; the renovation money is entirely spent on the renovation. W<span>e would normally charge for all of this project management work, mobilizing the community, putting word out on social media etc.; but</span><span>\u00a0in this case we have decided to make an investment in what we think is a strong concept, and even more in a group o</span><span>f people from the community that we trust.\u00a0</span>\n\n", "created_at": "2014-01-10 17:52:00", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:46.283811", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 825, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16826, "user_id": 2115, "topic_id": 3221, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Sounds like a plan!</b>\n\nI'll post also all the different network files and images alongside.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-07-01 12:17:54", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:34.100396", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 20, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32261, "user_id": 3154, "topic_id": 5121, "post_number": 22, "raw": "MMMh Interesting, thanks for your views...\n\n", "created_at": "2016-02-19 09:59:06", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:57.271240", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 8, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 1.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [32253], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4951, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 4918, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<em>This is a repository where we aggregate all visuals required for producing materials for projects which the Edgeryders organisation is officially backing.

(I will explain further why this is happening, at the end of this comment.)\n\n\"<strong>I want to know </strong><em><strong>God's</strong></em><strong> thoughts; the rest are details</strong>.\" (Albert Einstein) That pretty much sums what I would like to achieve. All my thoughts tend to this. An incredible force pushes me towards this.\n\nWithout really having understood it until recently, this has translated for me, in a concrete immediate way: \u00a0there is no need to talk. I suppose I associate talking with details (???).\n\nI did not want to quit! <em>J\u2019ai jet\u00e9 les armes</em>, I surrendered, because I was against the wall. There was nothing else I could do. After receiving the answer: \u201c<em>There is no solution. There is nothing at our government that allows us to do this project</em>.\u201d What a mega extinguisher\u2026\n\nI did not quit because I no longer believe in this stuff, or because I lack endurance or persistance / perseverance, or because I chose other priorities.\n\nAs with prisoners, I had no other alternative but to escape with my mind. Two or three weeks after I ceased all activity and gave up, after I completely let go, I reached the 3rd (of 4) level of inner development.\n\nIn my quest for paid work, indeed, I invested a lot in networking, social media, reading and thinking (creation of knowledge). I didn\u2019t go as far as writing a book. Hell, I'd like to have that drive (I may even make some money out of it) but all it tells me is to continue my race and not think about the details. I managed to explore really far. It's really amazing. I thought these things only existed in books. I was convinced that one of the most ordinary person, like me, would never approach such heights. But it happened. And it's not that difficult. One just really needs to understand what it means to be connected to all that exists. Euh\u2026 and perhaps a couple of other things.\n\nThis kind of quest for paid work led me (financially) to nothing. It led me to a big wall. An impregnable fortress. A fence higher than all the voices of citizens put together. Untouchable.\n\nI tried a quest for paid work in a more conventional way. I find it rather horrible to contemplate the results: I cannot make it either way.\n\nSo what to do?\n\n<em>Do not</em> <em>panic.</em> <em>Do not</em> <em>panic. Do not</em> <em>panic.</em> I repeat it to myself constantly. Trust your intuition.\n\nFor now, there is Edgeryders. The process helps me figure stuff about myself, like in a psychologist's office. Beyond that, I have no idea what will happen to me. But I know I am EXPANDING.\n\nVia Edgeryders, I realized that some of the things that I want to know \u2013 in an Albert Einstein way \u2013 <strong>I WANT TO KNOW GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL'S THOUGHTS</strong><span>.</span>\n\nCreation of knowledge is important for me. IT'S PART OF FILLING MY NEEDS. Exploring various models with others will probably help me filling this specific need.\n\nBy understanding what kind of thoughts correspond to the current leadership model, and having explored another kind of way of thinking, I could use this knowledge to help leaders make the transition: by helping them to become aware of their patterns and models, is it possible to guide some to change?\u00a0 (???)\u00a0 \\#JustSaying.\n\nWhat to do? What to do? What to do? I have questions, no satisfactory answer yet.\n\n****************************\n\nMeanwhile, something inside my body is changing, I am in a process of a deep physically transformation. When I sneeze, my fontanelle, the top of my head, really hurts. Houl\u00e0, something very weird is happening to the top of my head! I cannot ignore this. It's an important part of my development. I would like to be able to combine it to my making a living quest.\n\nI read this article yesterday by Deepak Chopra, \"<em>Did you know that your brain actually shrinks when you have Depression?</em>\" It really hit me. <a href=\"http://www.deepakchopra.com/blog/view/5/depression:_shedding_light_on_the_darkness\">http://www.deepakchopra.com/blog/view/5/depression:_shedding_light_on_the_darkness</a> \u00a0I do not care a bit about the details... This article had a reverse effect on me: it made me think about \u00a0what happens at the other end of the spectrum. What happens when someone is ultra happy? When someone is in a state of euphoria?\n\nEveryday --- \u00a0there is not a day that it does not happen \u00a0---, I feel that my head overflows. I have the sensation that my head grows and it pushes on the fontanelle. I suppose this makes me think more and more in a Paulo Coelho-like way.

Sign \\#2: \"<em>Shivers, crawling sensations, tingles on your scalp. Feeling pressure on the crown. Flashes of great inspiration / creativity / thoughts. Feeling vibration around the head and ears</em>.\"\n\nIf it happened to me, it can happen to everyone else\u2026\n\nNow, <strong>how can I use this to help others (and hey, me too</strong>!)?\n\n******************************\n\nHere\u2019s a more detailed explanation.<em> This stuff is real, it is a physical experience. </em>\n\nThe human <strong>BODY</strong> has to undergo a HUGE TRANSFORMATION in order to support higher states of consciousness.\n\nOnly the spirit has the necessary energy intelligence and operational software to use the full capacity of the human mind. This transformation \u00a0can lead to utilisation of the unknown 90% capacity of the brain. A spirit filled human mind will create harmony, unity, cooperation, understanding and will become a transformational votex, a channel through which universal awareness can flow into this physical world.\n\nThe evolution through which the embodied self becomes aware of its true immortal state involves a TRANSMUTATION of the whole personality in its subconscious as well as conscious aspects. This requires a complete overhaul and restructuring of the human machine (reengineering of the human DNA) to make it fit to become the residence of a higher intelligence, of an order greater than that which lies in a normal human body.\n\nIn the human body exists an extremely subtle and complex mechanism located in the SEXUAL ORGANS. This mechanism, when it is initiated and brought to a quick activity, reacts strongly on the body, and performs in a given period of time, a wonderful transformation of the nervous system and brain, resulting in the manifestation of a higher type of consciousness, to become the common heritage of Man in the distant future. (This mechanism is known as Kundalini.)\n\nDuring its rise from the seat at the base of the spine to the crown of the head, Kundalini energy sprinkles \u201cnectar\u201d (or very intense vibrations) to the six chakras (lotus) which bloom in six important junctions of nerves along the central nervous system, and governs the transmutation of sensory and vital organs. These chakras (lotus) bloom one after the other at the approach of the stream of energy, until the stream reaches the thousand-petalled lotus at the top of the head (called the crowned chakra), where it is absorbed in an ecstatic union with the collective consciousness. Released from the chains that bind a human to the earth, the embodied consciousness soars to the heights of sublime self-realization, awake for the first time after eons of enslavement of its own ineffable and immortal nature (in other words, a human being can tap into immortality and eternity before the time of death).\n\nOne feels distinctly an incomparable feeling of happiness running through all the nerves, moving from the fingertips, toes, and other parts of the trunk and limbs to the spine, which, concentrated and intensified, rises up with a growing intensity of delight, and eventually floods the upper region of the brain with an ecstatic and life-giving stream of rare vibratory sensation and radiating light.\n\nKundalini, as the supreme master of the body energy, it alone is being considered capable of giving to those who devote all their thoughts and all their actions, abandon themselves entirely to its will. Kundalini as the architect. It has the power to shape the human body, to transform or even destroy the body as it pleases. But how this energy manages to accomplish all this, in ways comparable with the biological laws that govern the organic world, no one has tried to clarify it in explicit terms yet.\n\nIt takes several years after the first awakening sensations \u2013 the Kundalini process of transmutation in all cells and organs takes some time -, before the appearance of mental parapsychic powers (miraculous) associated with the Enlightenment (described by Ancients).\n\n", "created_at": "2011-12-10 16:42:46", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:08.689328", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1595, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [11997], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28961, "user_id": 45, "topic_id": 1306, "post_number": 20, "raw": "<b>BTW</b>\n\nYou might be interested in this article by Michel Bauwens on achieving economies of scope through sharing:\n\nhttp://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2012/03/2012319125340857774.html\n\n", "created_at": "2012-03-23 17:42:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:39.399019", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 34, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [16515], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21689, "user_id": 102, "topic_id": 1485, "post_number": 11, "raw": "Thank you very much :)\n\nSometimes a simple step by step process is the best way to get your point across.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-10 06:53:58", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:00.751400", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 24, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [12802], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27060, "user_id": 105, "topic_id": 1633, "post_number": 14, "raw": "<b>Thank You for SHARING :)</b>\n\nEimhin, I feel happy to hear about your experience and glad that you have dedicated your time to share story about it \u2661\n\nI wish we all will find more appreciation to traditional healing arts and nature \u262f\n\nDo you cultivate an online journal where we can find more stories from your life?\n\n\u00a0\u263a for few more days from \\#occupybb7\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-24 20:52:13", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:29.676582", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 74, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 15.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [22457], "is_liked_by": [2095], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29356, "user_id": 1514, "topic_id": 5044, "post_number": 12, "raw": "I am inside CCH.

They seek advice, medical help and moral support from each other. They exchange knowledge and share resources. They meet, interact, and work together.\u00a0And, of course, no human can live well if he or she disconnects from the fabric of society at large (in recent times, care also happened in big bureaucracies, but that approach has issues. Here we look for something better).\n\n<strong>We think that this ceaseless exchange is collective intelligence at work</strong>.\u00a0Network analysis is a useful tool to understand this process, and perhaps find ways to improve upon it. Thinking in networks\u00a0is a great way to generate fresh, relevant questions.\u00a0How do you know your network is going in the right direction? What is a \u201cdirection\u201d in this context? Is everyone following the same path? Do people group into sub-communities? What are the focus of these (sub) communities?\u00a0\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">What</h3>\n\n<strong>We come together to find out how networked humans can better take care of each other.</strong>\u00a0\n\nTo do this, we study result-oriented conversations. Conversations are networks: people are its nodes, and the exchanges are its links. It you don't believe us,\u00a0<a href=\"/sites/all/modules/contrib/edgesense/static/dashboard.html\">click here</a> to explore the Edgeryders conversation network (allow a few seconds for the data to download). But conversations are networks also in another sense: each exchange contains some concepts. Example of concepts useful in care are: well-being, syringe, diabethes, fitness, prosthetics, etc. We can represent concept in a conversation as a network. Concepts themselves are its nodes; two concepts are linked if\u00a0they are in the same exchange.\u00a0\n\n<strong>Person-to-person conversation networks tell us who is talking to whom</strong>. Are there individuals who act as \"hubs\"? Why? Can we use hubs to improve the process, for example asking them to spread important knowledge?\u00a0\n\n<strong>Concept-to-concept conversation networks tell us how the different concepts connect\u00a0to each other</strong>. Are there surprises? Do apparently unrelated concepts tend to come up in the same exchanges? Anomalies might mean something interesting is going on. In fact, spotting anomalies is how <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1854_Broad_Street_cholera_outbreak#John_Snow_investigation\">John Snow\u00a0invented epidemiology in 1854</a>.\u00a0\n\nThe fascinating part is this: <strong>by looking at the network, we can extract information that no individual in the network has</strong>. The whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Collective intelligence!\u00a0\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">How</h3>\n\n<strong>We look at conversation data</strong> taken from Edgeryders and\u00a0build them into a network. We use open source software for network analysis. We then visualize\u00a0and\u00a0interrogate the network to see what we can learn. Our final aim is to prototype methodologies for extracting collective intelligent outcomes from conversations.\n\nOne great output from the workshop would be to unleash our imagination, and\u00a0<strong>specify design &amp; requirements</strong>:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>What views works best?</strong> It'll be useful to build it as a mockup if we do not already have it -- <em>use color pens, paper, clips, cardboard and build it into a mock-up!</em></li>\n\n<li><strong>For what tasks? </strong>Do we need to move things around? Pile them up to trigger comparison of things on-the-fly? Lasso an item to trigger some computation? -- <em>use post-it notes, cut and paste pieces of paper, draw arrows to turn tasks into real actions (on a screen!).</em></li>\n\n<li><strong>Using what ingredient (data)?</strong> What should we feed the system with to accomplish these analytical tasks? <em>-- write them down, cut &amp; paste, associate them with specific tasks, embed them into views.</em></li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThe workshop is a unique opportunity to have a design participatory workshop -- we want it to be a source of inspiration to <strong>design and build the next generation EdgeSense dashboard!</strong>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">\n\n<strong>Who</strong> should come</h3>\n\nMasters of Networks is open to all, and especially friendly to beginners. Patients, network scientists, doctors, hackers and so on all have something to contribute. But in the end\u00a0we are all experts in this domain. We all\u00a0give and receive care\u00a0in the course of our lives, and all humans are expert conversationalists. \u00a0There's an extra bonus for beginners: networks are easy to visualize. And when you visualize them, as we will, they are\u00a0often beautiful and intuitive.\u00a0\n\nTrust us. We have done this before (check out <a href=\"https://youtu.be/2-9z0i5fuvE\">the video above</a>).\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Data</h3>\n\nWe have a dataset drawn from a large conversation that took place on the Edgeryders platform in 2014. It consists of 161 posts and 910 comments, authored by 128 different people. All posts and comments have been annotated by a professional ethnographer. This leaves us with an ontology of relevant concepts: we can use it to build the network.\u00a0\n\nThat\u00a0conversation was not about care. We will need to be clever, and use different data to figure out a methodology to apply to a future conversation about care.\u00a0\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Agenda and challenges</h3>\n\nThe agenda is simple:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>We will spend the first hour and a half explaining how the data were formed, harvested and converted into a network. We will explore the network together using a software called <a href=\"http://detangler.labri.fr:31497\">Detangler</a>, brainchild of the wonderful <a href=\"/u/brenoust\">@brenoust</a>. Detangler is highly intuitive: we can use it to manipulate network without knowing\u00a0<em>any</em>\u00a0network math at all.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Then, we'll <strong>hack</strong>.\u00a0We can explore the data in many directions. Depending on how many we are, we can split into groups that look at different things. We see at least three possibilities:</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Visualization challenge</strong>. Create informative and beautiful visualizations starting from our data. Skills needed: design, dataviz, netviz. <em>Coordinator: @melancon (you can call me Guy)</em>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\u200bIts not only about creativity and beauty, it's about interactivity -- a map seen as a malleable object so you can squirk information out of it.</li>\n\n<li>It's also about being able to specify graphical design from the tasks you'd need to conduct on the data and its representation on the screen.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>How is a node-link view useful? How would you intuitively like to manipulate, filter or change it at will when exploring it?</li>\n\n<li>Would you feel you need to synchronize the view with a bar chart on some statistics? A scatterplot to figure out if things correlate?</li>\n\n</ul></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Interpretation challenge.</strong> How many conclusions and hypotheses can we \"squeeze\" from the data? Skills needed: social research, ethnography, network science. <em>Coordinator: @Noemi?</em>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Interpretation is at the core of the process. You play with data, you map it, and iteratively build hypothesis. In the end, you dream you would have provable claims.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b15e2e2aebc4c021f0f11ebe8616326825abbad7.png\" width=\"408\" height=\"274\">\n\n<strong>Quality challenge</strong>. Can we think of simple criteria to filter the data for the highest-quality content only (eg: only posts with a minimum number of comments, or of minimum length)? Does the filtering change the results? <em>Coordination: @Alberto</em>\n\nAnd more. But we insist that every group has a coordinator, who takes responsibility for driving it, sharing the relevant material (examples: software libraries, notes for participants, pseudo code...). If we only have two coordinators, we'll only have two groups. If you think you can lead a group, get in touch with us!\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">Tentative schedule</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>9h30 - 11h - @Alberto and @melancon (@Hazem @Noemi) give a start by drawing the overall picture, following the famous adagio \"A picture is worth a thousand words\".</li>\n\n<li>11h - 12h30 Teams give it a first shot\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>The viz team will play a game building their ideal visual dashboard using pen and paper, cardboard -- explaining why these features may turn to be essential when exploring or analyzing network data.</li>\n\n<li>The interpretation team output is critical: the directions they will provide has decisive impact on how data will be used, massaged and turned into visual representations.</li>\n\n<li>The qualitative team plays a similar role, feeding the intepretation team with high quality content -- their recommendations will make even greater sense if we can link them with paths of interpretation.</li>\n\n</ul></li>\n\n<li>12h30 - 14h Feed your brain with proteins and glucids.</li>\n\n<li>14h - 16h\u00a0Teams go back to work and build a proof-of-concept of the ideas /hypothesis they came up with in the morning session.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Cross-fertilization of ideas with the other teams is encouraged.

I'm Arina, 28 years old, my hometown/country is Chisinau, Moldova. For this academic year I'm in Zurich (Switzerland), I'm a visiting scholar at the University of Zurich... but so far the plan is to be back home at the beginning of July. Before, some 10 years ago, I was a high school exchange student in the USA (Michigan state). And not so long ago I did my Master's degree in Bologna (Italy). Study-wise, I'm in the field of Management and Economics, but independently specializing in music industry.\n\nAnd work-wise... a great part of my experience is connected to music industry. I worked for 4 years with the Moldovan music band \"Zdob si Zdub\". Not continuously, some of that time was during my Bachelor studies in Moldova, then I returned to the band after my Master. This was a very rewarding and fun experience, with twice going to Eurovision Song Contest, releasing albums, participating at festivals...\n\nIn my early adulthood, some friends and I formed a youth NGO. The friends elected me as the leader of it. This was a great practical school. We did it mostly voluntarily and based on time availability, but we managed to run several projects that involved fairly many people.\n\nAs for hobbies... listening to a lot of music, always keeping an eye on the new one; travelling - but except my USA experience, so far I've visited only Europe; hiking...or better let me say - walking :) ...enjoy the performing arts, I mean attending theater plays, dance performances and of course concerts of all kinds of music; I like taking pictures :)) but here is the link to my 'journal' <a href=\"http://arinacretu.tumblr.com/\">http://arinacretu.tumblr.com/</a> it's mostly about my hobbies :)\n\n///\n\nI do a lot of the free time activities alone. Now I'm trying to remember where, when, and why this \"habbit\" started... (some time thinking here) and I'll say - in the USA, 10 years ago, because it was a new place for me.\n\nUntil 18 years old I spent all of my time in Moldova, except a few holidays in Romania and Ukraine, together with my family or friends. There was basically a group of people that I grew up with, we were doing many things together, I felt always active and full of energy. When I was 16-17 years old, I participated in a contest - the final result of it was - a few high school students were selected to go for a year in the USA, to live in a host family, to study in an American high school, and receive a small scholarship for own expenses. This was an yearly contest and it was pretty popular... I participated because 'I should, many are doing it', it was a good excuse to miss some classes :) ...and because \"what if?\" :)\n\nThere were several stages to go through, every time less and less people, but I still didn't feel like - I might be one of the finalists. So one day i got a phone call with - \"Congratulations!\" I was - \"wow, thank you!\" but in the back of my mind - \"hm, what should I do? should I accept it? of course i should, this is such a great chance! many wanted it and you got it! but it's 9 months far away from home...and i never lived far from my parents...and there will be completely totally only new people, what if i don't like it? i cannot return home until the end of the programme.\" i knew i am a very independent person, but still... :) my parents encouraged me to go, although i'm sure the heart of my mother was saying \"no\" :)\n\nand it was a wonderful year and that experience influenced me a lot... my host family was very cool, the school was very good, I met some of the best teachers ever and some great other students... but still there wasn't the feeling of belonging to a group, like I had at home. And I was finding myself doing some activities on my own.\n\nI was attending some school clubs in arts and sometimes I was staying alone beyond the club hours... well, generally painting is not really a group activity :) then another thing, maybe the most important one in this matter - in the USA most people drive, but I liked and still like to walk. It took me one hour from school to home and I was totally fine with it. I got a walkman in the USA and it was great listening to some music and walking. In Moldova, one of my best friends and I lived in the same apartment building and we studied in the same class... so every day we did the walking together (but that walk was only 15-20 min on way). In the USA I lived in a small town and walking along the road was ok, lots of nature, nice houses... but it was funny that many people were stopping their car and were asking me - are you alright? do you need a ride?\n\nalso, there I got my first camera and i started to attend a photography class at a Community Center. thus another activity in my life - walking around and taking pictures of nature. and I took a Computer Graphics class in school and I discovered another enjoyment -\u00a0 own photo manipulation in PhotoShop.\n\nAnd really, never thought of it before, but namely these activities helped me to be more comfortable with being alone... and not depend on others.\n\nhm, my story is becoming very long....\n\nwhen I returned home, my friends and I had another high school year to go... and afterwards we went to different universities. Although physically not far from each other, we had different schedules, new colleagues. Anyway we were meeting frequently, we were also running the NGO together. And of course adulthood means building your own path...\n\nAfter the US experience, I really wanted to do my Bachelor's at home... but in the same time that experience opened some other new interestes for me, that would involve going abroad - for travelling and for live concerts. I attended many local live concerts before going to the USA, but I never let myself think that I could attend a superstar's concert. And in the USA those superstars seemed so close, they had concerts not far from where I lived, but no one that I knew was interested. There I couldn't go alone... instead I told myself that \"next time\" I will go alone, somehow. The artists that i like still don't perform in Moldova... but they do in Romania. So in 2006 I went on my own to Bucharest, to see Depeche Mode. It's a one night bus drive from Chisinau to Bucharest... another night - back.\n\nThe concert was fabulous and I told myself \"I want more\". That time I stayed at a guy's place and I didn't personally know him, I met him via an online forum. During the concert I got acquainted with some people sitting next to me, they also gave me a ride after the concert. It was such a great experience, all together. But many people at home were thinking I'm a bit crazy to do this...alone.\n\nThen this activity became more frequent... I started to know more people here and there. Then I went to Bologna for 2 years, for my Master's. Now I'm in Zurich.\n\nI'll try to sum up :)\n\nI travelled alone to Belgium and The Netherlands. But it's partially alone, because there I've stayed at the place of some people that I knew, except attending Werchter Festival (2008). Well, the whole 3 weeks trip was organized due to the festival :) I went there with my tent, my sleeping bag and enjoyed it for 4 days. I was alone, but met some great people on the way or on spot.\n\nI've been alone to numerous concerts of various magnitute... at some point I also joined CouchSurfing.org and sometimes I was travelling to a new place and meeting up with locals that were also attending the concert/festival (and staying at their place).\n\nAlone I wandered through Barcelona, Copenhagen and the surroundings, Paris, some places in Italy, Switzerland, Romania, Germany. At the end of May I'm going to Berlin, alone. Anyone from Berlin? :)\n\nOf course, there are people that go to places much further and less organized... but this is not to compare with somebody. I just wanted to say, although it took me so many words, that certain life experiences taught me to freely do something social on my own. Of course it is nice going to a theater play with somebody that is also interested... but if there is no one like this around, why should I deprive myself from the pleasure of attending a theater play? Maybe at that event I'll meet someone with whom I'll enjoy another event. And it happened so several times. I got the surprised \"Alone?\" for so many times... but I'm not ashamed to say a firm \"Yes\" and also show surprise that they are surprised.\n\np.s.: I'll post it now, 1:30 am... sorry, no editing was done :)\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-08 23:31:30", "updated_at": "2017-08-30 10:37:25.404571", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1665, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 15.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7444, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 3435, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Yay!</b>\n\nCongrats! :))))\n\n", "created_at": "2014-07-31 17:18:35", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:43.677823", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 6, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9005, "user_id": 1450, "topic_id": 3820, "post_number": 2, "raw": "between this and matera2019, you're really packing in the good news for LOTE.

I am already more than half through the ER channel on youtube, half without watching, just listening. The stuff that <a href=\"/u/sammuirhead\">@SamMuirhead</a> made is really good - I sure watched that. :) For me it often works like this: the extended audio records (e.g. your talk on lighthouse arts channel or at lausanne) give me the vibe and atmosphere of a place/thing, while the carefully edited videos are usually like the abstract of a scientific paper: extremely dense in important information (which needs the visual channel, and some of the background info I got through audio beforehand - to put it into context and make more sense of it).\n\nI think views and dis/likes are unfortunately very unreliable metrics on the (youtube-)edge. We have to use our own brain. ;)\n\nYeah I saw the news calendar. It had me a little confused because there was no call scheduled for today. Eventually I found it in the events of course. I'm not sure but perhaps it would make sense to merge news-calendar and even-calendar?\n\nI very much agree with trying to keep the commenting on one (this) platform. I think it would be cool if one could \"suck in\" other platforms (like twitter, etc.) and comment here on several of them in the same context. That would probably be pretty much what the <a href=\"http://ifttt.com\">Ifttt.com</a> thing could help with if I understand correctly. I would not push too hard for now. I've started with making mock-up interfaces with pen&amp;paper, but I have to think a lot more about the different use-cases we have to cover. For me it could be e.g. a 7 inch tablet in a workshop or fablab that I stick on a wall or a machine so I keep in touch while working. Perhaps I can do a quick skype call, document what I'm doing, or monitor ER's \"radio traffic\" via audio or a ticker. And for the lunch break, or while waiting on something for a couple of minutes I'd read a post or two and jot down some 140 char comments. Anything bigger and I'd be changing workplace to a desktop pc or notebook. Many \"makers\" will have a similar use case, but the vast majority will certainly want the interface optimized differently...\n\n<a href=\"/u/sammuirhead\">@SamMuirhead</a> I could imagine you or others already went through these thoughts a couple of times here. If that's the case I'd be interested if I can see some of the ideas that came up.\n\nOne more thing with community call - multimedia: we also don't want to scare people off by recording all kinds of stuff. But I think audio is not sooo much of an issue.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-07 19:34:23", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:38.579775", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 509, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 1.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [15701], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30371, "user_id": 1935, "topic_id": 2853, "post_number": 13, "raw": "<b>how about pushing things forward a bit </b>\n\n<span>@dina yes I wish I could attend the last event about the alternatives for education . actually there are lots of efforts everywhere and forums discussing this issue .

I always felt a mix of awe, for such a top-notch example of collective intelligence at work, and true frustration, for being horrible at actively contributing to online discussions.\n\nThe reasons why I'm that \"elusive\" (as @Alberto once described me <img alt=\"smiley\" height=\"23\" src=\"/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png\" title=\"smiley\" width=\"23\">) are many; I won't bother you with those, but please trust me: it is not lazyness.\n\nBeing a designer involved in sustainable development, and passionate for complex systems, my interest for Edgeryders is some way self-evident. What I can add to what you'll guess already, is that I really appreciate the Novelty of the practices which the Ryders are experimenting (and the subtlelties they imply).\n\nI feel I share that enthusiasm, the vision (and the concerns), and truly believe in many of the ideas discussed and promoted here, the good way.\n\nIn my daily life I work as a VFX artist, trying to surf the inconsistencies between the pointlessness of the markets I contribute feeding, and the difficulties in actualizing an alternative and constructive way of dealing with my profession.\n\nIn a cached, parallel life, I work on a hyper-long-term project, experimenting non-real-time forms of collaboration and knowledge collection.\n\nThis sounds cryptic (and a bit silly) but all it means, really, is:\n\nI think and discuss with friends a moltitude of projects and ideas, whenever we have time; meanwhile, we figure out ways to work on those as part of a single higher-level project about plausible, sustainable futures.\n\nThe broader focuses of the project are: research and interviews about the inter-disciplinary and critical aspects of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Common_Future\">our common future</a>; responsible forms of architecture, design and engineering, capable of embracing and serving the principles of sustainable development; a serious and thorough investigation on the potential of cinematography and storytelling, in conveying contents that matter; strategies and tools to let people make and maintain collaborative projects.\n\nThe project is called <em>Futuro Anteriore</em> and is currently in Italian only. I know this sounds naive but, for the time being, I have a good reason; I'll find an appropriate room to say more, if anyone's interested.\n\nMore sparse stuff about me:\n\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mapofemergence\">twitter.com/mapofemergence</a>\n\n<span><a href=\"http://uk.linkedin.com/in/stefanocieri\"><span>uk.linkedin.com/in/</span></a><span><a href=\"http://uk.linkedin.com/in/stefanocieri\">stefanocieri</a>\n\nplus something I did ages ago:</span></span>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.itgoesgreen.org\">itgoesgreen.org</a>\n\nIf you read until here, thank you: that's why I love this place <img alt=\"smiley\" height=\"23\" src=\"/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png\" title=\"smiley\" width=\"23\">\n\nBest,\n\ns\u00a0 t\u00a0 e\n\n", "created_at": "2015-12-22 00:58:22", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:29.593997", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 584, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 30.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 3028], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27819, "user_id": 2569, "topic_id": 757, "post_number": 13, "raw": "<b>Intergenerational divide in our politics and world view</b>\n\nPolitically, we can see a large divide in the aspiration and acceptance of 'outsiders' between the generations.\n\nMy Grandmother (and many thousands her age) have become increasingly conservative in their world view. From what i can gather, their experiences growing up straight after WW2 in a culture that still had lots of echoes of the wartime propaganda left an indelible mark on their attitudes to the outsider.\u00a0\n\nI grew up in a multi-ethnic society, with children from multiple places around the globe. To me, there is no fear or mistrust in seeing people from other ethnic backgrounds around me. But for my grandparents, there is a lingering Nationalism, a lack of acceptance of 'otherness' - socially, sexually, racially. Brought up in the social strictures of oost-war Britain they reject the social liberalisation that they have lived through. One could argue that they didn't really get to experience the full force of the social liberalisation. Many married young and had children young, many women stayed as full-time child carers and had little interaction outside of the home. Many had large families in the models of their parents before them. Their children have experienced the social liberalisation fully (sexual revolution, oral contraceptives, relaxation of the divorce laws), they grew up with a few non-white faces around them because of Windrush (immigration to UK from newly Independent West Indies) or from Indian sub-continental immigration before and after Partition. Their children (my parent's generation) were also the first people to truely benefit from the way that membership of the EU opened up travel around Europe and the North African coastline. They experienced the realities of live in other countries and these experiences changed how they think. My grandmother has never been outside the UK in her entire life.\n\nNow, at the point when she is starting to struggle with self care (and here i definitely agree with @johncoate 's view that there is a stubborness and irrational sense of personal independence in their generation) more of the balance of looking after her falls on her kids, whose lives have been so different from hers.\n\nMy point then is a difficult one to conceed. Although my grandmother is my family and helped to raise me, i find spending time with her very difficult. Her views are borderline racist at times, her attitude to the world is very negative, her experience is narrow and her opinions old fashioned. I am expected to show respect and deference to her based purely on the fact that she is older than me, yet i know my experience of the world is richer and wider than hers. I wouldn't want to be forced into living in that straight-jacket in order to reduce care costs.\n\nI do think that there are some positive ideas coming through around intergenerational living though. It's not that i'm intrinsically against 'old people', i think the irony is that i'm not especially fond of MY 'old people'. I would be more than willing to help look after a number of more liberally minded old people. It comes down the idea first put forward in the Open&amp;Change discussion in HuisVDH\u00a0\n\n<em>\"Free, but alone.\" vs. \"Belonging,\u00a0but coerced\"\u00a0</em>\n\nFor me, i'd rather free and alone. But i can also see the attraction of belonging. But not the coersion.\n\nPerhaps this strength of intergenerational bond in Middle Eastern culture is down to having a more cohesive and\u00a0consistant\u00a0view of the world than we have in the West. Our horizons have expanded to include views about social and personal freedom that still struggle to gain ground in more conservative cultures.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-11-13 10:05:49", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:33.444404", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 651, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21083, "user_id": 145, "topic_id": 3027, "post_number": 12, "raw": "<b>What ever happened to the \"un\" in the unmonastery?</b>\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Hey all, nice to hear some real issues of community being aired a bit.

Did not realize you guys had taken it all so far and so literally. An unAbbott even?\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 It did seem like it was going a bit far with discussion of uniforms, robes and such, as if the identity of a community relied on an image rather than real relationships and solid communication agreements.

Too much to do, too many boxes to tick, too little time to get to know people.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Am still hoping to get involved at some future iteration of our idea, balance out some of the being amidst the doing...

It's the first time in my live I've swapped non-profit to for-profit, and it's a pretty big deal. And I woudn't have done if I didn't believe in topishare's misson, and that of the founder Rotem, Hila, and Yair (daughter, mother, and father by the way).\u00a0\n\nAnd although topishare is officially for-profit, half of it will be shared with its users and the other half will be invested in not-for-profit projects around the world (this is, of course, once topishare starts making profit).\u00a0\n\nAnd it's been an inetersting journey.\n\nNow, before I explain what topishare is, I'd like to let you know that I want your advice. Setting something up, no matter what it is, demands a lot of you, and you can't do it alone.\n\nSo, the reason I am posting this, is because I know in both Edgeryders and topishare have the\u00a0same goal, the same aim: to make this world a little bit a better place (although both with a slightly different strategy :).).\n\nAnd one of the things I learned during the first and second edgeyrders project in Georgia, is that by collaborating, helping each other, we can achieve together so much more than alone.\n\nSo, I thought, who better than the Edgeryder community to tell me what we're doing right and wrong at topishare.\n\nNow, a little bit of background story: topishare was born in the jungles of Costa Rica, by Rotem (she's officially my boss :).). She was 22 at the time, and had 'fled' the western world to take her mind off the crazy world we live in. But while in Costa Rica, she realized that the local community there, which was super active and did amazing things, couldnt reach out to the world outside of Saint Theresa (where she was), or could collaborate easily within the community itself. So she wanted to help them, with a small online project. Two years later, the beta version of topishare was launched (March 3rd), and it turned more into a new sort of social network, than the initial community idea.\u00a0\n\nSo, what is it we do? In short: it's an online platform where everyone can create Kingdoms, which are - basically - mini-social networks where you are in control of everything, from privacy - no datamining\u00a0- to the kind of features you want\u00a0(we're working on the open API to make this really happen), and have topic-based conversations, like on Star Wars, or veganism, or online privacy.\n\nWe\u00a0want to make a platform accesible to all - we're working on different accesibility tools for people with disabilities or other issues that may prevent them from using social networks. Our first is voice-posting, which was developed by our founder Rotem, as she is dyslectic and hates to read and write as a result. But there's much much more in the pipeline.\n\nBut it's hard to understand really what it is people would need. I follow (and love) the OpenCare project. But I don't really know yet how we could collaborate on this. Or perhaps you have another idea how we can understand what it is people with whatever dissability would want/need?\n\nNow, in order to share our profits with the users, we do need to make profits\u00a0(those crazy capitalists!). So, we have a business model.\n\nAnd that's where I'd like to hear your thoughts on as well.\u00a0\n\nOur main idea is to have\u00a0user-controlled advertising (you decide where which ad goes and get 50% of the money the company pays to advertise on topishare) and you can make money with quality posts. Does this make sense?\u00a0\n\nWe're still in beta, and really appreciate any comments you may have\u00a0(I prefer them to be constructive ;).). Or any other ideas you have you think we should incorporate, do let me know down-here in the comments. Thanks!\n\n", "created_at": "2016-06-06 10:15:39", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:32.797750", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 773, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6053, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 6020, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/4/4b1e76621bd7e3bfcb19957a1a70d249822d5234.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"459\">\n\nWhen one sees a young girl wrapped heads to toes in proper islamic covers, there might be little expectation that she is a researcher and an inventor. Years of successful propaganda depicting muslim women as oppressed and limited worked out quite well, and I was happy to chat with Andi Nurul to prove it wrong. I asked her how she feels about being a woman in academia working in the northern island of Sulawesi. She felt comfortable and strong, being involved in researches throughout her studies (she is a bachelor so far) and working now as a lecturer assistant. Her parents pushed her to be a teacher and so she ended up exploring biology education as a field of study, instead of chasing her dream to be a journalist. What they probably didn\u2019t expect is that their daughter has a talent in science and soon would become passionate about agriculture and ways to improve it in her country.\n\nAt the Youth Global Forum Andi Virinda was on the stage, presenting her organic fertilizer on behalf of a team of three girls (Sri, Andi and Halifah). Earlier this year they came across a research on how maja fruit could be a useful component in modern farming in Indonesia, and began developing a formula. The fruit itself is in abundance in Asia, easy to be found anywhere in Indonesia, and only used for its shelves. Yet it is rich in nitrogen, micronutrients, and tannin. By adding rice liquid and coconut shell and molasses she finally came up with the perfect formula: plenty of macro and micronutrients, easily absorbed by the ground, with a strong smell of tannin that repels insects. The crops she tried her fertilizer on were significantly faster than any other crops in the university garden.\n\nWhat matters here is a change of the attitude of the farmers and education. Andi has a plan for that. Once they receive a grant, they will go around Sulawesi, or even Indonesia, and train farmers how to make the fertilizer themselves. She hopes that what she found out in her crops will convince the farmers to organic fertilizers, which they believe to slow down the crops and have no use in protecting them from insects. Andi says she is not interested in making a commercial enterprise out of it - although if they receive orders, they would be happy to produce the formula and sell it to their clients. What matters is healthy produce, and by assuring this she is not only helping the farmers, but her fellow Indonesians in having access to safe, quality food.\n\nBesides, she\u2019s been investigating subjects such as food security, where she researched food to food processes and ways of transforming leftovers to nutritious products, such as fish bone to milk and banana peels utilized into crackers. And as educator, she wrote a book on project based learning that uses local resources and one about contextual learning for students with disability. Some of this work has been simply part of her bachelor's\u2019 thesis, but others were funded by the Ministry of Education of Indonesia and Explorers\u2019 Club Award, a fund from USA, which she was given twice in the past two years. If everything goes right, she will be studying in Japan or UK soon, doing her master under a supervision of professors whose research is in line with her interests.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-12-09 07:43:08", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:34.827645", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 608, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25825, "user_id": 82, "topic_id": 2070, "post_number": 12, "raw": "<b>everywhere (if I'll try to formulate it would be personal)</b>\n\nwandering around the platform and reading other people's posts.

I was not at Ouishare and have not heard Michel's talk, so I cannot say anything about it: but elsewhere\u00a0I did\u00a0hear a lot of talk about common goods. It seems to be in fashion. I think it's the name: hey,\u00a0they are \"common\", so they must be sociable, friendly, they bring people together! They must be a good thing. So it does happen that people call \"common goods\" what are, in fact,\u00a0<em>public</em> goods. Like Nadia, I would classify Wikipedia as a nearly pure public good,\u00a0\n\nGetting the name wrong means risking getting your policy implication wrong as well. Specifically: the whole policy problem around common goods is how to regulate access to them (this is the overarching theme of Ostrom's\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/isbn/item1140521/?site_locale=en_GB\">Governing the commons</a>). Viceversa, for public good access regulation is no problem at all: what makes them public is the fact that their consumption is not rivalrous \u2013 if I consume an extra unit of a public good, this does not imply that someone else has to reduce their own consumption of the same good. Ostrom's examples are all very analog: forests (once\u00a0I log one tree, no one else can log the same tree), fisheries (once\u00a0I catch one fish, no one else can catch it again), aquifers (once I pumped a liter of water, it regenerates very slowly). The digital realm works by different rules: by\u00a0reading a Wikipedia article, I don't take away anyone's possibility to do the same. If anything, the social value of a Wikipedia article\u00a0<em>grows</em> with every perusal.\n\nConsequence: you could try to monetize Wikipedia by putting it behind a paywall. Maybe it would be fairer towards WIkipedians. But it would definitely destroy wealth, because it would reduce the consumption of a good that does not deteriorate by consuming more of it. And since digital\u00a0goods don't deteriorate with consumption, paywalling means creating an artifical scarcity \u2013 just as Hollywood does with the files of\u00a0<em>The Simpsons.\u00a0</em>The Pirate Bay's whole argument was that artificial scarcity ( which they view as a bad thing) is the\u00a0<em>opposite</em> of sharing. If indeed it was suggested in a conference on the sharing economy\u00a0\u2013 well, I'll be surprised, though I do sympathize with the fairness argument.\n\n<em>End of the comment. If you are not familiar with the economic argument above, read on for a\u00a0<span>silly example in the tradition of 18th century economists.\u00a0</span></em>\n\n<span>Picture an economy consisting of a single farmer that grows tomatoes. Tomato seeds are freely found in the environment, and they have price zero; so does fertile land. The economy contains an endless supply of Wikipedia articles with all possible information on the cultivation of\u00a0tomatoes. The farmer divides his time between researching methods for growing more, better tomatoes and actually working the field. All the research consists on him looking up stuff on\u00a0Wikipedia.</span>\n\n<span>Now suppose a paywall is put around Wikipedia. The farmer has to pay (in tomatoes, for simplicity) every time he reads an article. At this point, he will be tempted to cut down on research activity: if he just grows tomatoes as he always has, he does not have to pay anything. If he is not curious or ambitious enough, he will then be content with doing just that. More realistically, he will adopt an intermediate solution, reading fewer articles than he would with the free Wikipedia (for example, only when a\u00a0blight breaks out). Whatever the solution adopted, the point is this: the paywall forces the farmer and Mr. Wikipedia to share the tomatoes (so it might be fairer), but it also\u00a0reduces the number of tomatoes to go around (it is less efficient). There is an efficiencly loss, as the farmer attempts to duplicate knowledge that already exists behind the paywall. The efficiency loss comes from the fact that knowledge duplication has zero cost: an economy that shares all knowledge is, all other things being equal, always more efficient than one that does not.</span>\n\n<span>Economists have known for a long time that a system of market prices is great at allocating resources within the domain of private goods (rivalrous, excludable); and, conversely, that it sucks outside that domain.

One model enables purchase of the currency for mainstream commercial banking credit / or mainstream paper bank notes,\u00a0</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>and enables to re-exchange the freigeld for such

some of its suppliers in euros ),</div><div>enable to create small margins to fund the management of the system.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>The demurrage and exchange cost also creates an incentive for finding others within the economic network of currency users, who can provide similar goods or services. \u00a0 Instead of purchasing products from the other side of the world, people may prefer purchasing a local product. \u00a0 \u00a0Combination of non hoarding / circulation of money in the economy with incentives for enabling it to flow locally. \u00a0This aims at the strenghtening of the local economy. \u00a0 \u00a0But one could also imagine such approach within a network such as Edgeryders, which could be more spread out over

unfold,</div><div>reputation of the users builds up, in effect creating visibility for additional forms of alternative ( reputation and social ) capital.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>Various currencies can easily emerge, as they can be created based on contracts defined as metadata.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>For example, a mutual credit IOU expressed in hours can simply be metadata related to a transaction between peers. \u00a0If peers choose to trust their networks of peers, using for example ripple like protocols, such hour IOU protocol could be cleared through other transactions.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>The context building through netention like tools also enables queries and matching between needs and offers, or also enables to understand where there may be needs and what solutions may require development.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>A netention like tool facilitates allocation of attention based on our own ( intentional ) preferences and on our histories

A kind of amalgam of local currency, reuse of unused municipal resources, hackerspace and maker culture and some open design production tech mentioned in EarthOS, with the goal of replacing youth unemployment by DIY prosperity. That's what I want to discuss with Mr. Maran in this session and evaluate a bit how doable it is. Will mention some practical projects of myself and other Edgeryders as a background and reasoning for this proposal, but thought that talking about an integrated idea is better for discussion than having separate snippets only. Even if the integrated idea will not become reality without many changes and adaptations, as also in the case of EarthOS.\n\nWould be glad to meet you before, and any input is highly valuated :) Will hopefully arrive 12:30 or a bit earlier.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-12 23:47:53", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:43.725385", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 218, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [29741], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27509, "user_id": 2464, "topic_id": 5227, "post_number": 17, "raw": "<b>Good</b>\n\n@Hazem So you are now officially coordinating the interpretation challenge!\n\nLooking forward to meet you at LOTE5.\n\nGuy\n\n", "created_at": "2016-02-16 17:34:51", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:31.940053", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 27, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [27450], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17446, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 1834, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Duolingo</b>\n\nAs for an online learning system for learning Italian, give <a href=\"http://www.duolingo.com/\">Duolingo</a> a try.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-08-04 06:15:06", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:37.338661", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 25, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [15180], "is_liked_by": [84], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30294, "user_id": 2956, "topic_id": 5073, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>Accomodation in Stockholm</b>\n\nI'll be flying into Stockholm on the 22nd before heading to Brussels.

So we are organising a workshop in Cairo where we meet, build on the online conversation we're having already and map local assets. The workshops are documented and shared with the rest of the International Edgeryders community to learn from and share the knowledge.\n\n[Purpose of workshop]()\n\nTo draw out people doing interesting work in the local social innovation/hacktivism/tech scenes by offering an opportunity to discover and learn from interesting projects their peers are working on elsewhere, and to share their work and learnings.\n\n[Format: action oriented and designed to be useful for hands-on practitioners: ]()\n\nThe Edgeryders event format has been developed by hundreds of participants in over 30 cities.\n\n1. [b]Find each other online:[/b] we introduce ourselves and our projects here and participants can ask each other questions- so we are sure everyone understands one anothers projects and what challenges we each face.\n\n2. [b]Swarm the challenges:[/b] We identify shared obstacles and engage the rest of the Edgeryders community in sharing ideas or experiences of how to address them.\n\n3. [b]Build shared solutions:[/b] The physical workshop is where we co-design shared solutions that can be built by the participants in the room. We then follow up and continue online.\n\n[b]We know this process works.[/b] It\u2019s how we have gotten projects like the unMonastery, and Economy App off the ground in less than two years in spite of most of us having very little money.\n\n[b]Who it is for:[/b] Anyone passionate about their project. Citizens and representatives of initiatives related to unemployment, migration, poverty, environment and use of common spaces, arts, do-it-yourself approaches, community health and wellbeing, innovative civic participation channels etc.\n\n[How it contributes to achieving participants aims:]() We'll surface cutting edge projects and practices from the local scene and connect them to the ones already in the Edgeryders community. By meeting another on the Edgeryders platform and presenting our projects in advance, the physical workshop will be more generative for participants. We think this good for everyone and inspire and energise new collaborations between participants.\n\n[A generative workshop would result in the following outcomes:]() \n\n* get participants excited about [b]sharing personal stories and interacting with others in a context of trust and peer support[/b] -> both during the event and after it, online\n* [b]map where appropriate kinds of resources can be found[/b] if needed -> who can act as a local community builder and host subsequent events or spread the word about Spot the Future, what initiatives generate most enthusiasm and support from the others in the room  \n* [b]inspire the people in attendance[/b] (both physically and through social media - hashtag #futurespotters) to engage more people who are NOT in attendance. \n* [b]acknowledge future-building initiatives and encourage an ethics of rewarding the doers.[/b] This should make it more sustainable to engage in effective actions in one\u2019s local community. \n* [b]mutual support around one anothers projects, and collaborations with people all over the world.[/b]\n\n\u200bTo register:\n\n* Sign up here on our web home and share your personal experiences around [making a living](https://edgeryders.eu/t/spot-the-future-making-a-living/561), [making a difference](#) or [caring for commons.](https://edgeryders.eu/t/spot-the-future-caring-for-commons/559)\n\n* As soon as we have your contribution we will send you a ticket.

It must be noted that Francis Gosselin, as debate moderator, took notes during the whole session, and posed some heavy questions on the table, as will be seen further onwards.</span>\n\n<span>As indeed was expected by all, the appearance of Open Government and ICT was one of the first issues on the floor, and was answered mostly with platitudes right off the book. Yes, government can be a platform upon which to build applications, and yes, it should increase accountability and transparency. That, of course, remains to be seen, as all experiments on Open Government have been limited so far and in most cases quite local, and in difficult times it is rare the government that is willing to lose control to empower citizens.</span>\n\n<span>The already mentioned case of Access Space was taken by Emma Toledano-Laredo as an example of the kind of initiatives that are looked for by the EU in general, and most of its states in particular. Not specifically for its inclusion, no-one-left-behind approach to social intervention, but for its low cost. One for the community, indeed. The problem came a bit later, when asked by Francis on EU policies on collaboration with non-established collectives. There is no plan to work with emerging communities that do not have the possibility (or need) to become an established citizen association or other type of \u201cacceptable\u201d group (i.e., NGO). If this looks short sighted, well, it is, just as much as it is unavoidable due to the amount of administrative red tape that covers all EU official collaborations with the citizens in a joint venture. </span>\n\n<span>In comes the community at large (and the twitterverse)</span>\n\n<span>Edgeryders is, foremost of all, a community-centered think tank to provide knowledge to the institutions of the EU so they can enact successful and actionable policies. But this is not your run-of-the-mill US-style think tank (it is unlikely the community will have brilliant ideas such as those that brought to the invasion of Iraq).</span>\n\n<span>From the Edgeryders point of view, it is first and foremost a community, a platform where to exchange and publish ideas, experiences and forethoughts. And of course, the agreement inside the community on goals, procedures to make them happen and personal experiences is non existent. That creates little conflict in the community itself, used as Edgeryders are in having online disagreement (and a certain ease of managing offline disagreement as well), but can seem baffling to those not used to online, constant interaction.</span>\n\n<span>The most clear example of this was the Twitter wall projected behind the table. While the Q&amp;A part of the session was running, having usually at most one thread of conversation at a time, Twitter was exploding in comments, ideas, exchanges of information, planning and whatever else can be imagined. </span>\n\n<span>Compared to that, the session itself was an excellent kickstart for the real (virtual) conversation that took place online, but it could not keep up. Nonetheless, the community started launching ideas during the Q&amp;A, with mixed results.</span>\n\n<span>As an example, a question about the EU implementing a model of </span><a href=\"http://www.crowdfunder.com/img/equity-crowdfunding-infographic.jpg\"><span>equity crowdfunding</span></a><span> (where a startup is owned by the community who has donated to create it) was basically unknown by most present (both Edgeryders and policy makers). And no wonder, as crowdfunding in general is something that has been approached very recently by the usually subsidies-based administration, and equity crowdfunding is such a US-born initiative that it shows itself as allergic to state intervention. However, for local projects such a scheme might relaunch the local economies without taxing the local administrations, at a moment when their budgets are being reduced day by day.</span>\n\n<span>Another idea that came along, and may be unrealistic considering the way institutions do their work, was the creation of a \u201cmake everything better\u201d fund, instead of dividing the funds among different areas. This holistic approach has some merit: social inclusion policies without health care (as can happen with separate budgets) are quite ineffectual. Of course, to be able to apply such a scheme the whole of the EU administration should be rebuilt from the ground up, and that usually incurs such costs that probably there would be no money left for such a fund.</span>\n\n<span>Another proposal quite like to be immediately forgotten was the creation of a startup support programme similar to that established by President Obama in the US. That was quite easily (and frighteningly) turned down with a single sentence: Society is changing. Quite an interesting choice of words, as what it meant was that there is no intention of funding programmes to promote innovation via startup creation, which in turn would likely increase employment and, thus, European countries\u2019 internal markets, making the economies of the EU in general a more solid and survivable model than the current \u201call you need is austerity\u201d trend. But such is life, sometimes you win one, sometimes you don\u2019t.</span>\n\n<span>Some other ideas went straight to the marrow: the open sourcing of food production (considered impossible by some and as an ongoing project by others), the problem with squatting criminalization, taking into account the incredible quantity of vacant residences in Europe (which was, quite understandably, conveniently set aside, as the right to private property is there, in the European Convention on Human Rights, as the first Protocol), along with hundreds of ideas more that appeared on the Twitter wall, showed the muscle of a community brought together to be a think tank. </span>\n\n<span>Ah, the Twitter wall. For many present it wasn\u2019t such a big deal, after all the basis of any conference or unconference is having the tweets right there so one can follow several conversations at the same time, but... to see a Twitter wall in the Council of Europe, where everyone feels absolutely free to say whatever comes to mind. That is an idea the European Parliament might want to adopt, with just the right touch of bravery. </span>\n\n<span>And the public did feel comfortable with it. Just to give an example of something no one would have said out loud but had no problem tweeting:</span>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/leashless\"><span>leashless</span></a><span> \u201c</span><span>To watch the Ravening Beast of Cryptoanarchy cutely demonstrated on a CoE stage gives me the chills. </span><a href=\"http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23LOTE\"><span>#LOTE</span></a><span> *it's the end of all taxation*\u201d</span>\n\n<span>Now, not what you usually see in a Council of Europe conference, right? Exactly.</span>\n\n<span>And it showed as well the main problem with these think tank, citizen-driven models: we don\u2019t speak the same language.</span>\n\n<span>Many of those present in the session were doers, people who see something wrong and just go ahead and fix it. The talk in these cases is very direct: we have problem A, and for that we need to do B and C. Once there is an agreement with that, you go ahead, carry out your part of B or C, or both, and if everyone is on the same wave the problem gets solved. </span>\n\n<span>This engineering approach is fine and good, but the way of expressing A, B and C is direct and solution-based. Policy making works on a completely different level, and for a hacker approach may seem inefficient. At the same time, policy makers think of the processes needed to apply precisely that, policy, which is often an indirect approach to the problem, and requires much fine tuning of a certain word in a specific article, or the use of a specific term in another, to make the law pass, not to mention strategic voting and lobbying. All these techniques are alien to Edgeryders at large, and can mean the difference between a successful engagement of the two groups and failure. </span>\n\n<span>If Edgeryders must be the think tank for Europe, we better start getting some translators soon, who can articulate the hacker discourse into something understandable by the institutions, and vice versa. Who can make the translation on both sides?</span></b>\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-29 15:52:27", "updated_at": "2018-06-03 06:02:01.139898", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2398, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 35.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1690, "user_id": 665, "topic_id": 1657, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\u00a0\n\nOne of our tasks in the We The People session at the conference is to define the challenge we're facing in a single slide.\u00a0\n\nWe all know at a basic level how dissatisfied people are with politics at <a href=\"http://www.hansardsociety.org.uk/blogs/press_releases/archive/2012/04/25/audit-of-political-engagement-9-part-one.aspx\">national</a> and <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb76/eb76_en.htm\">European</a> level, and how the crisis all around us demonstrates a serious failure of the political model we've lived with for twenty years. However, I think we have two problems with summing up - or even agreeing on - those challenges:\n\nFirst, we all have our own view of what the political crisis really is, and whether the representative democracy model needs a few repairs, or is completely beyond saving.\n\nSecond, the existing power arrangements aren't going away, and making change happen when it's against the interests of some well-placed people won't be easy. I think it can be done, but the solutions we come up with have to be <u>much</u> better than the current arrangements, <u>obviously</u> more democratic, or the big public - the 499,999,900 Europeans who aren't Edgeryders - won't be convinced.\n\nSo I want to be, perhaps, a bit provocative, and set out a reverse challenge: not what's wrong with the system now, but what has to be right about the solutions we create. Apologies in advance that these examples are mostly British, that's the country I know best. It's a personal worry list - the things that keep me awake at night when I think about my attempts at writing about and doing democratic and participative reform.\n\nI'd be really interested in hearing during the conference or in the comments whether these are the right worries, what I've missed, and what projects or ideas out there have succeeded in cracking some of them. Here are my six top worries:\n\n1. Getting them in\n\nAs I said in a mission report on one of our projects, people aren't that interested in democracy as a concept, and often they aren't much more interested in democracy in practice.\u00a0\n\nIn the UK, only a third of people would be interested in the chance to have their city development plan drafted by their local community, and <a href=\"http://www.out-law.com/en/articles/2012/may/locals-sceptical-about-neighbourhood-planning-reveals-ipsos-mori-poll/\">only 12% would be interested in becoming involved in the drafting</a>. Perhaps (this is my dark middle-of-the-night thinking) public services have started to behave like consumer product companies because the public want to be treated as consumers. <strong>How can we encourage people through the door, or do we need to?</strong>\n\n2. Being representative\n\nRelated to that problem is the limited range of participants who come through the door in traditional exercises. Aside from the obvious questions about how you include disabled people, those with low confidence or serious health problems, there is a wider problem of interest being skewed towards a \"civic core\" who are less diverse, older, richer, and better-educated. There's some <a href=\"http://www.tsrc.ac.uk/Blog/tabid/504/EntryId/26/A-civic-core-of-volunteers-and-charitable-donors.aspx\">interesting research</a> on what that civic core looks like in Britain - it's about one third of the population.\u00a0\n\nGiving the people who are already engaged better tools doesn't reduce the unequal representation in society, in fact it makes it worse. We don't want to create tools that boost the voice of those who can already get their voices heard. <strong>How do we ensure that the people who are participating are representative of the population as a whole?</strong>\n\n3. Scaling\n\nIt <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_Takes_a_Village\">takes a village</a> to raise a child, as the old saying goes, but it <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/energy/index_en.htm\">takes a continent</a> to set a credible energy policy. We don't have to have the same democratic tools and village and European level, but we need to be able to encourage broader participation among 500 million without drowning the unfortunate policy officials in individual answers.\n\nSimilarly, the best democratic mechanism will understand and respond to the sort of issues that human beings have (\"I'm worried about climate change\") rather than the sort of issues that organisations have (\"what should our rules on maximum road transport axle weights be?\"). <strong>Can we create a democratic environment that allows issues to be considered at the right level, and speaks human rather than organisation?</strong>\n\n4. Public service change\n\nLots of money, and lots of power is tied up in current institutions that aren't always ready or able to respond to citizen pressure. We can't build a new democracy in a vacuum, how can we support, encourage and drive the public services to reform the way they do their work?\n\nMy personal experience is that the most difficult \"layer\" to manage is the middle, where people want to protect their staff and their budgets, but don't feel they have the flexibility to make radical changes. These are the places where the walls of the <a href=\"http://www.bptrends.com/resources_glossary.cfm?wordid=1585D3FD-1031-D522-3C41C050AD12C6DA\">silos</a> are strongest - managers neither junior enough to ignore the rules and work with colleagues, nor senior enough to see the bigger picture.\u00a0<strong>How can we make public services an active ally rather than a passive barrier in democratisation?</strong>\n\n5. Being informed\n\nShould there be a minimum quality standard for democratic discussion? We've seen the <a href=\"http://order-order.com/\">low quality</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/uk-edition\">bitterness</a> of much political debate online. We know that trolls and \"<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scotland/9182125/Time-for-Salmond-to-rein-in-the-cyber-nats.html\">astroturfers</a>\" can easily take over discussions with pre-prepared comments or simple abuse. Can we make participatory democracy better than those online examples?\u00a0\n\nWhat information do people need to make good decisions? In America, there is concern that fact-check websites have limited effect. Does it matter if a news story is inaccurate, since people might well be reading it only for confirmation of their existing views? <strong>How can we support an informed and fact-based democracy, rather than a shouting competition that favours those with time and money?</strong>\n\n6. Barcelona 1936\n\nI can't remember where I read it, but I was struck by a recent description of the Internet as <a href=\"http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/scw/orwell.htm\">Barcelona in 1936</a> - a brief period where revolutionary outcomes seemed a real possibility, and control by either state or established institutions had disappeared.\u00a0\n\nThe corollary of that is that the next stage is the re-imposition of \"normality\" - a concerted attempt by governments and corporations to take over the Internet and push its use towards commercial and consumer ends, or the continuation of current power and economic structures. Is this going to happen, and if it is, would that be such a bad thing? <strong>How can we ensure that democracy and participation online isn't crushed by Facebook or an authoritarian regime?</strong>\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-13 14:10:27", "updated_at": "2017-09-01 07:21:11.636826", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1364, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 15.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32317, "user_id": 1434, "topic_id": 1839, "post_number": 22, "raw": "<b>hangout participation</b>\n\nHello Rita,\n\nWe'll be happy to have you at the hangout.You and all those who are interested in organising the pasta party!!\n\nTalk to you at 7\u00a0pm!\n\n", "created_at": "2013-09-02 12:46:35", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:57.620941", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 41, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1438], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9319, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2420, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>You are hired :-)</b>\n\nGreat news, [Simonedb]!

But, in a phrase that reminds me of one of the awful/awesome scenes from \"The Graduate\"\u2026.\" \"let me say one word to you\u2026..<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking\" target=\"_blank\">Meshes</a>\".\n\nYes, totalitarianism is the biggest risk we face as most of the world wants to keep taking the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_pill_and_blue_pill\" target=\"_blank\">'blue pills'</a>. But almost every home has its own radio transmitter/receiver these days, better known as a WiFi-enabled router. Also, there are lots of home brew GSM kits being developed.\n\nIt is not going to be as hard to counter the 'FUD' tactics as it was in 1939. However, the experience of seeing the 'authorities' commit the UK to two pointless wars in 2003 should give even the most optimistic of us serious pause for concern.\n\n<strong>Time to get cracking on equipping our cadres with the new tools of revolution\u2026.</strong>\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-07-02 10:58:48", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:49.277496", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 680, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11236, "user_id": 3331, "topic_id": 689, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>I like  ecofriendly solutions </b>\n\nThe issue was another: Waste of resources due to untimely change and lack of timely change\n\nNone have to do with the type of Diaper ;-)\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-08-29 20:51:06", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:04.941630", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 38, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [7867], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23712, "user_id": 2321, "topic_id": 3466, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Helping out in Matera</b>\n\nHi all,\n\nI live in Matera and I would like to help with this task, so just let me know what I can do.\n\nciao,\n\nazzurra\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-09-07 21:16:03", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:11.623624", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 43, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30243, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 5132, "post_number": 28, "raw": "<b>Just wanted to say I love this thread</b>\n\nnom nom nom nom.

If you want to propose one, you still can.\n\nWhat I need to know: please write the answers in the appropriate boxes, I am making this a wiki.\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Did you really propose the session, and did you really mean it for Track 1 \u2013 Upskilling for change? Sometimes it is unclear whether people are making a proposal or just playing with ideas.

You and someone else?</li>\n\n<li>How long is the session?</li>\n\n<li>What is it? A lecture, a workshop, a shouting match? Can you make a rough program for it, so people know what to expect (<a href=\"/making-lote3/skilling-up-for-online-collaboration\">example</a>)?</li>\n\n<li>Do people need to bring along anything (example: laptops)?</li>\n\n<li>Do you have any special requirements? (Example: Giuseppe's session does not take place in the unMonastery, he plans to lead people around Matera to take pictures).</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nWhat you need to know:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>We'll try to put chairs, a projector and a whiteboard or flip chart in every room. Everything else, you'll have to ask for, and we will do our best to get it.</li>\n\n<li>If your session is longer than 45 mins, you might want to allow for breaks \u2013 but you already know that.</li>\n\n<li>Please leave your room in order after you have used it.

The day's sessions came together under the theme \"Spatialities of Co-Creation,\" showcasing ethnographic case studies and narratives of emergent spaces and their ability to reshape how we think about employment, global networks, and art practices.\n\nWhile unfortunately the sessions were not recorded, the slides from my presentation are available on the unMonastery GitHub <a href=\"https://github.com/unmonastery/presentations/tree/master/rgs-igb_annual_international_conference\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n\nFocusing on the origination of unMonastery and the Materan protoype, I gave an overview of projects like <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ots_matera\" target=\"_blank\">OpenTechSchool</a>, <a href=\"/t/coderdojo-matera/3222\" target=\"_blank\">CoderDojo</a>, and <a href=\"http://mappingthecommons.org\" target=\"_blank\">Mapping the Commons</a> - as well as the knowledge gained and mistakes made during the prototype - and highlighted the ability of partnerships, like the one between EdgeRyders and MT2019 establishing a <a href=\"/t/edgeryders-partners-up-with-comitato-matera-2019-to-create-a-civic-innovation-network-and-offers-support-to-participate-in-conferences/3481\" target=\"_blank\">Civic Innovation Network</a>, to connect citizen-led initiatives.\n\nI felt what emerged from the day's conversation is the necessity to rethink co-working spaces' objectives amidst global economic precarity.

Decision-makers: if the project foresees the participation of decision-makers or experts in the youth policy field, these participants can be involved regardless of their age and geographical provenance.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tMinimum 30 young participants must be involved in the project.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tMaximum Grant Awarded: 50000 EURO</li>\n\n<li>\t\tTravel grants for participants are given based on the distance - example:\u00a0For travel distances between 100 and 499 KM:\u00a080 EUR per participant ;\u00a0For travel distances between 500 and 1999 KM:\u00a0170 EUR per participant\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<span>It almost duplicates the structure for Youth in Action, and <strong>the main issue that I see</strong>:\u00a0We need to make sure we have at least 2 partners in every country we suspect</span><span>\u00a0Edgeryders joining Lote4 would come from!\u00a0This was an issue in our former application, and it is now too because you need to decide in advance how many ERs in each country, so you are in fact limiting funded\u00a0participation and\u00a0highly restricts the variety of people joining. The more countries and nationalities you include, the more partners:\u00a0:-(</span>\n\n<span>Guess what: It's also the<strong> British Council in the UK who is managing the application process as a National Agency</strong>:\n\nIt seems they require the applicant to be registered at the</span>\u00a0European Commission Authentication Service (ECAS)<span>\u00a0</span>http://www.erasmusplus.org.uk/how-to-apply\u00a0\n\n<span>Also need to mention that we need to get the partners well in advance. If their procedure will be same as last year, the person running the application on behalf of Edgeryders (a resident in UK who can sign the application and be the contact person!! not sure Noel can sign an Edgeryders application?) needs to collect all signed partnership agreements in original. They don't accept scanned copies! \u00a0\n\nSo my suggestion is that we first make sure we can meet all of these conditions and have someone to coordinate this, participate in the British Council webinars or send inquiries with list of questions we might have. Then rephrase the application we had based on input about Lote4 - which by the way will need to happen in the UK\u00a0(Edgeryders LBG registered there +\u00a0see bullet point \\#2 above).\u00a0\u00a0I can't coordinate this as I can't sign for ER, being based in Romania, but will help as much as possible!</span>\n\n", "created_at": "2014-02-26 16:52:47", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:47.898556", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 679, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [30475], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11773, "user_id": 2464, "topic_id": 5227, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Thanks</b>\n\nGood.

So started working on a landing page and then stopped, I wanted to check-in and find out from everyone, what we think it should contain. I did however plugin an IRC channel, just because it's super simple.\n\n<a href=\"/page/connect\" style=\"color: rgb(233, 92, 46);\">https://edgeryders.eu/page/connect</a>\n\nI think it should look friendly, with a logical information hierachy.

I find it difficult to trust anything that is too sure of itself and purpose. It also embodies the demand that's put on the user: \"if you do not build it, it will not get built\".\u00a0\n\nThat said, there's a lot of improvement that can be done and there is clearly a deficit of skillsets, for example EdgeRyders lacks video content that accurately describes its process and story for potential future EdgeRyders - to date what we have is a sort of quasi promotional content that is unsure of its audience. EdgeRyders as a whole has also always bias'd the highly digitally literate.\n\nWhat I think we need at this point is (at least)\u00a0user journeys -\u00a0that take into account sense making and service design, that do not discount online and offline interaction but are equally accounted for. I'm not sure we should aspire to building the perfect platform with a seamless user interface (I just don't think we'll get there - because our needs are continuely evolving and our resource is low).\n\nThe original project within my understanding was grown with a snow ball effect in mind; peers were invited to join EdgeRyders based on individuals being able to communicate what they felt was valuable about EdgeRyders, if these new comers could identify similar value through their own experience, they would likely emulate their introduction to the platform by inviting\u00a0their peers and thus the platform grew out with a mix of small clustered communities. This ensures EdgeRyders is able to continuely evolve and stimulate fresh ideas.\n\nThese are just a few thoughts, based on my own experience, I'd be happy at some point (when there is time) to begin to translate my approach to EdgeRyders into coherent user journeys as a way of identifying what might be improved.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-09-15 12:34:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:54.918027", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 800, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 10.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28159, "user_id": 2561, "topic_id": 4286, "post_number": 14, "raw": "<b>Hi </b>\n\nI joined it too :)\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-07 17:24:43", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:35.252942", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 9, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29372, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 5801, "post_number": 8, "raw": "Just ping me when you start, I have an interview around 9AM CET, so hopefully I can jump in sometime right after it", "created_at": "2016-08-10 04:35:45", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:41.621971", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 23, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21574, "user_id": 61, "topic_id": 2305, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Opening ceremonies</b>\n\nMarilena\u00a0/ Alberto :\n\nThe idea of bi-weekly gatherings to profile some aspect or another of the collective work/interface with the greater community is very much in discussion as our working model. \u00a0The first one of these can indeed be a presentation of our good intentions. \u00a0However,\u00a0we don't want to overwork the community connection before we have something tangible to offer. \u00a0I suggest that our first interface meeting\u00a0have some kind of remarkable form to elevate it above a round table presentation. \u00a0I also suggest that the power of this first presentation will be amplified by the nature of the <em>unMonkship culture </em>on display -- it is therefore such that our initial two week* <em>auto-massage</em> of each other will be the place to define which form this first presentation can take. \u00a0The more warm, open and relaxed with each other and each other's precious projects the better...\n\n*the idea of dedicating the first two weeks to internal process has been discussed by Ben, Christiano and me and I think aired on at least one web-meeting. \u00a0Of course, the inevitable practical things that need solving will occupy much of our initial time.

I am also studying a postgrad diploma part-time in Sustainable Development.\n\nHaving completed a Bachelor of Business and an honours degree in Information Systems Management in 2013, I was hopeful that I could find employment.\n\nAfter completing the course, I decided however, that I did not want to work with technology on a continuous basis, as I found that the final specialised year was soulless.\n\nDuring college I had done some volunteering, and so, knew that I had a leaning towards working in business for a social cause.\n\nThe other constraint I had over the years, was an accumulation of a few gaps in my C.V because of past mental health issues. I had started suffering from anxiety in my teens which really affected my self-esteem. This condition really impacted my development. So, by the time my friends were going to college at 18, I stayed at home and was happy to take care of my grandmother who needed support. I was on and off medication for a long time.\n\nI tried lots of things, individual counselling and group therapy, which really did help me. Success really came for me through trying alternative therapies such as bio energy, acupuncture and reiki.\n\nUnfortunately, we live in a society that places huge stigma around mental health issues so in terms of employment, people are encouraged to cover up any such issues. The C.V gaps gave me less of a competitive edge in the job market and I was 8 months unemployed after college. The emphasis placed on having experience to get jobs can be an obstacle. Even though I had experience volunteering throughout my time at college, I found that companies don\u2019t recognise volunteer work, because you haven\u2019t been paid for it.\n\nI decided to return to volunteering again, for a wonderful NGO where after 3 months a shop management position presented itself. That was like winning the lotto for me, I can tell you!\n\nI don\u2019t like the money grabbing, I need there to be a social dimension and something more sustainable. Unfortunately,only 8 months in, this wonderful NGO working to support development overseas had to close their Irish operations, to make the charity more sustainable. I went on to get my current job as a charity shop assistant, again after an 8-month search. I love working in this environment, as you get to meet real heroes with real struggles and tales of survival.\n\nIn 2015, my Mum got cancer. My beautiful Mum has always been a brave and determined warrior. My folks have undergone a lot of problems with housing during the economic downturn in Ireland. They moved in with one of my uncles who is a diagnosed schizophrenic to take care of him. They each have always played the role of carers in both of their large families, often taking on huge burdens of care for their siblings, very selflessly and very much to their own disadvantage. The thanks they end up getting for their efforts, is having to look for a new home while Mum was in the early stages of cancer, due to one uncle behaving very aggressively and selfishly toward them.Mum did not need to be further subjected to that kind of stressful behaviour.\n\nThankfully, after a short search period, my folks ended up moving into a house in my neighbourhood.This was hugely beneficial to me, as I was then positioned to be of help to them, where I could, in supporting Mum on her journey to recovery.\n\nThe past few years have really been a very harsh eye opener for me, into the affects an economic crisis has on people\u2019s lives. It has detrimental impacts on people\u2019s health, welfare, living conditions and psyches.\n\nThe other side of the coin is, that I have fortunately come to discover, the absolute profound healing and joy that comes from people around us, the hearts and minds of people who genuinely care.\n\nThat sense of community and connection is the most important aspect to life and has certainly helped me and my family to cope through the last few years.\n\nThere is a dire need for an extension of this supportive community, in tackling the many varied and complex social issues of our time.\n\nThe most recent suicide and cancer statistics, highlight the absolute urgency, in finding alternative ways, of connecting and supporting the people who are struggling within our communities.\n\nThanks to all involved in Edgeryders for all your hard effort in attempting to achieve that!\n\nI hope this community will be very successful in its reach.\n\nLove and best wishes to you all!

Moving faster necessarily implies less bureaucracy.\n\nLet's suppose a government project requires more time than 90 days. I would plan it in stages. Steps of 90-100 days, with a pre-established action plan (I like clarity crispy clear action plans, well defined in advance) and published at the beginning of operations, for everyone to see clearly in which direction the government is heading (this allows for re-adjustments, gives room for experimentation to obtain citizen's interventions, leaves a door open to new unexpected ideas to be proposed, and therefore, you end up with improved strategies). I would set up an online dashboard that shows progression of projects made by the team(s) or department(s).\n\n<strong>Hesitation</strong>, however, it is definitely not included in my model of leadership. \"<em>The only limits to our realizations of tomorrow is our doubts and hesitations now.</em>\" (F.D. Roosevelt)\n\nIn the case of Quebec, no need of a PhD to understand that there has been - and there still is - hesitation.\n\n[Parenthesis] In addition, I have other means of obtaining supporting evidence. The project has been delayed by several factors, one of them is related to health.\n\nWhen a person gets sick, I always ask what this person has. This information is very important for me, because the illness he/she contracted or the accident he/she had informs me about the thoughts of this person. There is a metaphysical definition to all diseases. Those who discover the secret of self-healing (a power that grows out of the \"unutilized part of intelligence\", and which is easily within the reach of each individual), also know how to interpret the factors behind diseases. In any case, I use this to better understand people and situations, as others read body language during an interview. It gives me an overview of people's fears (accumulated over years of thoughts), and these fears can often be found in echo, in their risk aversion. I have a very different way to read people and situations. but this approach usually provides relevant insight.\n\nThe role of a leader is to give a vision to an organization: why it has to exist and what improvements it brings to our lives. The leader makes decisions influencing the future of the organization and the decisions have to be consistent with the leader\u2019s vision. I can see that it is difficult to make decisions about something, when the 'something' is not included in the leader's vision.\n\nWhat happens when there is a lack of open government vision in leaders of a government? Hesitation can be felt at all levels.\n\nBy hesitation, I mean that a leader can easily answer the question \u201c<em>I do not know</em>\u201d. But a leader cannot answer \u201c<em>I do not care</em>\u201d. Sometimes leaders do not clearly say \u201c<em>I do not care\u201d</em> (they talk about other topics, and focus on other priorities). However, their lack of words or gestures provide a hint.\n\nAnother problem - that can be directly associated with open government implementation delays - arises when managers of a government think that it is impossible for a leader to say \u201c<em>I do not know\u201d</em> or \u201c<em>I made a mistake</em>\u201d. In many instances, an infallibility syndrome leads to paralysis.\n\nLack of vision, hesitation, and infallibility: they can lead to wasting months and months, and even years of precious time.

I've already though a lot about it and would be happy to share ideas about communities.\n\nIn short: it's a tech-centered project, not a social one. Think of Open Source Ecology and their GVCS set for 50 machines as providing the basic tech to <em>build</em> everything an autarkic mini-society needs. That however is not the full story: it also needs instructions how to build actual products with these tools, how to govern a mini-society, and eventually, <a href=\"http://www.seasteading.org/\">how to be sovereign</a>.

As our study program focuses on a topic rather than a discipline, I had an excellent opportunity not only to get engaged in multidisciplinary discussions but to learn, use and explore different research methods, so I am quite familiar with both quantitative and qualitative ways of have fun and explore the social world.\n\nAt the moment of writing this I am in Budapest, but I am flying to Georgia on April 7 (and I am super excited about it!) to conduct a research for my MA thesis about Georgian Muslim women in the autonomous republic of Adjara. I am interested in religious and national aspects of their social identity and the narrative that keeps them from converting to Christianity (which is perceved as an integral part of Georgian national identity). I will conduct semi-structured interviews which later will be coded and analyzed with WEFT. To be fair, it will be the first time using this program apart from short practise - but hey, I did it all before, using pen-and-paper method so the basics are pretty clear.\n\nAlthough my academic career is short, these are some highlights that I am proud of: I participated in prof. Kirk Hawkins (Brigham Young University) research on populism in post-soviet countries, Together with another Lithuanian we coded speeches by Lithuanian leaders and measured their level of populism following K. Hawkins methodology. It was last year - I managed to do this research, to write 7 academic papers, to attend the classes, write articles for Lithuanian media and stay sane.\n\nThis spring I am going to present my papers in two international conferences: International symposium on culture and identity in Baku May 26-28 and Nationalist Responses to Economic and Political Crises organised by the Association for Study of Nationalities (ASN) and my university in Budapest June 12-14.\n\nTo sum up: I am the person that you probably want! I will be in Georgia for all the time span of the project so if I need to lead a small team of Georgian speakers, I can communicate with them outside of the web;\u00a0 80 percent of my time I am switched to my academic mindset and workmood (another 20 percent keep the inner journalist alive), I will be using WEFT to deal with my own thesis material, so I can spare few hours daily to work with this project - and yes, I can manage my time (proven by last year experience).\u00a0\n\nHere is a link to my LinkedIn profile:\n\nhttp://hu.linkedin.com/pub/inga-popovaite/58/268/857\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-03-27 15:48:08", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:13.913812", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 472, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20678, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 5943, "post_number": 5, "raw": "I think it would be a fabulous event that some progressive city hall might be interested in supporting financially (maybe Austria, or Germany?) but also it provides a great chance to fundraise, as people can chip in for the projects they can see actually working, not just being exhibited (although we surely can do both).

I was vacinated for various things (occasionally after a pause for partents to consider this), with only one scar to show for it as far as I know. One broken thumb fixed (utility cycling accident), one broken wrist fixed (silly skateramp bike accident) - both a few years ago now, but my memories of the fixing up are only good. Even though in the latter case the break, and associated hospital visit, was hundreds of miles away from my home town (a national service is important! ). I've also had support with depression and anxiety, a less positive experience involving longer waiting times, but ultimately this was pretty good as well - and was really important to me at the time that it was free at the point of need. Some prescription charges through the years, which is not so great, but they were affordable for me at the time (and they don't apply to those on certain benefits in the UK). Blood tests and some B12 injections to make sure my vitamin and mineral balance was coping with veganism, I'm really grateful for that. I have a very supportive, friendly GP, who has allayed my fears when I have gone to check things I was worried about checked out - I wouldn't hesistate to make an appointment if I was worried about somthing - I wouldn't (at the moment!) have to worry about whether or not I could afford the appointment or any treatment.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOther experiences: my sister had a squint sorted out. A friend had a major operation which saved her life but left her paralysed, years of physio, and another operation which sadly couldn't save her life again.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<ul><li><b style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; font-weight: normal;\"><span>What didn\u2019t work so well and how did you find the way around the problem?</span></b></li></ul>\n\n\u00a0\n\nI can't really think of anything. I'm lucky to have services nearby - in the past transport to GP/Hospital has been an issue as I don't drive.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<ul><li><b style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; font-weight: normal;\"><span>What does that suggest about how to improve the resilience of society in this area?</span></b></li></ul>\n\n</div>Not a lot, really... Save to prioritise health (\"there is no wealth but life\") over the imaginary 'wealth' of the financial system. Public health systems are struggling under cuts, but what's that - banks are still getting bailed out to the tune of billions?\n\nMaybe what we need to think about when we think about health is not only Resilience but *Resistance* to the global attacks on publicly owned healthcare systems, and to the monopolies of the Pharmaceutical industry. We certainly need to avoid feeding into the propaganda that publicly owned health systems are inefficient or ineffective. I actually think these systems are more resilient than we might think at first too - are doctors and nurses going to stop having a caring impulse because the system of financial transactions is creaking? Are they going to begin to deny their expertise to people? I think I would argue that the bigger threat to public health is less a financial crisis and rather more the priorities of the current financial system!\n\nI'm slightly concerned by phrases like:\n\n<b style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:medium;font-weight:normal\"><span>\"get creative about improving health prevention and care, so that what\u2019s most important gets done as well as possible given the circumstances?\"</span></b>\n\nand\n\n\"The idea was to figure out ways to empower communities to co-design and co-deliver their own health care \u00a0- and the <em>real</em> idea, of course, was to save some tax \u00a3 in the process\"\n\nHaving been involved in a long campaign against a so-called 'social enterprise' that threatened to fragment our local health services - removing them from the National Health Service and the associated public accountability, exemption from VAT, national economies of scale and bargaining power etc etc, makes me VERY cautious about being \"creative\" with ownership models (see here for video footage of me explaining the campaign, and issues in the UK health sector at present: http://keepglosnhspublic.posterous.com/public-meeting-thursday-15th-march-2012 and the root link http://keepglosnhspublic.posterous.com for lots of information on the campaign).\n\nI am very aware of the need to consider the challenge of peak oil to healthcare (and I'll admit that financial collapse poses risks as well). I'm less convinced that demography is a problem - this seems to be the argument of those who will cut pensions as they increase spending on wars.\n\nIf not particularly keen on upping taxes on health 'bads' as a solution either. I'm not a smoker, and hated coming home from my barman job stinking of smoke, but in the UK, high taxes and bans on smoking has not stopped everyone smoking - they have just stigmatised people, helped break centres of community (pubs, which are closing very quickly), and raised a lot of money for the government from people who are addicted to something (and hence unable to make a free choice). Not a great solution as far as I'm concerned.\n\nI'm personally particularly interested in the public health issues around weight - and the possible positive work that policies on food and transport could do to improve diets and increase exercise. Not taxes or financial inducements, but the redesign of cities to reduce car ownership and use and increase walking and cycling, and education in, and shared public spaces given over to, cooking and growing food.\n\nAll for now, look forward to discussing this in person!\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-13 23:40:30", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:15.003801", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1358, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [9253], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13834, "user_id": 62, "topic_id": 1407, "post_number": 29, "raw": "<b>me neither :)</b>\n\nMe neither i admit...but I know, for some friends experience, that is possible.

Think of something for Edgeryders - a service or a product.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>Improving our ticket management?</strong>\u00a0We\u2019ve initially estimated the cost of a ticket at 2 days of work, which may be unrealistic for those busiest. How about lowering that threshold and double up the work value so more people can be involved without putting too much of a strain on them? Those who have completed the work already with an extra MakerFox credit can earn an extra ticket for a friend, so no losses there. Like we love saying, it\u2019s all a prototype you know?\n\n\u00a0\n\n<em>*A limited number of grants are available to support trips to Matera, and awarding them depends on the active role we are each taking in shaping this event, as early as possible. Natalia will let you know about the possibility when issuing your ticket.</em>\n\n</div>", "created_at": "2014-09-08 15:13:58", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:19.615134", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 816, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29293, "user_id": 1933, "topic_id": 3162, "post_number": 11, "raw": "Welcome bro, my pleasure:)!\u00a0\n\nThank you too for your efforts to get people in!\n\n", "created_at": "2014-06-22 12:09:47", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:41.159514", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 18, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19170, "user_id": 2459, "topic_id": 4140, "post_number": 7, "raw": "This is what Assembl was designed for to a T!\n\nWe're even integrating visuals to represent how participants are connected and how arguments are connected.

I wanted to find out so\u00a0to begin I asked Birmingham, UK based <a href=\"http://peteashton.com/\">Pete Ashton</a> to tell me about his experiences.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/iyR8HDYuPF4\n\n\u00a0\n\nPete hasn't had what many would consider a \"real full-time\" job since 2003 and since 2007 he has made a living based around his online activities.\u00a0\n\nHe has a lack of formal education, describing himself as not academically proficient, and drifted into various jobs but when seeing his future as a retail manager he quit work and began exploring ways of doing something more fulfilling. A period of volunteering on an organic farm as part of the <a href=\"http://wwoof.org/history.asp\">WWOOF </a>(Working Weekends on Organic Farms) programme taught him how to live frugally and he began began doing temporary jobs to pay the rent while spending the rest of his time doing what Pete calls \"stuff\".\n\nThis stuff was mainly doing fanzines, blogging and taking photos and through this he began to blog more about the city and participate in flickr groups, participating in days taking photos around Birmingham. The city blogging led to him meeting <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/stef\">Stef Lewandowski</a> and together they began the <a href=\"http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/\">Created in Birmingham</a> blog. The blog was about awareness boosting initially but finally was about providing a grassroots style media outlet - with a subtext of DIY media. Pete ran it for a year, joint-winning the Guardian Media award for best blog in 2008.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/MA7TVu7jD70?rel=0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>Full-time blogger</strong>\n\nThe success of Created in Birmingham meant that Pete began to get paid 500 pounds a month, meaning he could stop doing temporary work and could do full time blogging. This then led to consultancy gigs in 2007 where he was paid to talk about blogging and run training workshops, something he still finds surprising. The main takeaway of the workshops was that social media relies on the personality of the people using it.\n\nSince then he has been living off his own work, doing it or talking about it, and even has the choice or turning down work, enjoying it more than anything he has ever done for money before. \"It would be difficult to return now to regular work\", he says.\u00a0\n\nI asked him where his ideas come from and what made some successful:\n\n\"if you don't have enough ideas you're doing something wrong, if you have to protect your ideas you're doing something wrong. It is not the idea that is valuable but doing it\". He throws out ideas because if he can't do something with it, wants to see someone do something with it and considers that shared ideas are more valuable and Intellectual Property is not valuable.\n\nWe talked about how the <a href=\"http://socialmediasurgery.com/\">Social Media Surgery</a>, recent winner of the <a href=\"http://podnosh.com/blog/2012/02/16/social-media-surgery-movement-wins-the-prime-ministers-big-society-award-hurrah/\">Prime Minister\u2019s Big Society Award</a>, came about. Pete was getting lots of questions about social media so he decided to sit in a cafe and people could come and ask him there, like a doctor's surgery. If people came along it was fine, and if they didn't he would get on with work. Pete did the surgery for about 3 or 4 months and then <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/podnosh\">Nick Booth</a> took the idea and turned it into global movement. He is happy to take credit for idea and beginning it but gives Nick the credit for where Social Media Surgery is now. For Pete the Surgery idea came from a real need, blogging is a necessity for him, enabling him to work through ideas and problems, almost like therapy.\n\nHis personal situation helps in trying out ideas, he has no dependants and because of his system of 3 months money in the bank or 1 big job per month to cover costs, he doesn't have to worry too much if ideas turn into work. Ideas establish him as someone interesting and worth working with, he does \"crazy\" ideas for fun but they lead to paid work like making websites or consultancy, which is not always particularly interesting but pays the bills.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/3Z8-qJ4KsVU?rel=0\n\n<strong>Tools &amp; books</strong>\n\nAs far as tools go he mainly uses the Internet, to connect with people, share ideas around and share other people's ideas.\n\nPete considers his most valuable tool is his ability to write - he is self taught after failing in school and has handwriting issues\u00a0 but computers saved him in that respect. He developed his writing through fanzines &amp; writing for pleasure, developing a unique style. \"Internet tools are trucks to deliver content, blogs are so easy to set up that having a blog is meaningless and having a blog with great content is the hard part, that's hard and takes time so experience is important.\n\nBeing an early adopter = more practice, not better but you've had longer to figure out how to do it.\"\n\nI asked him why he is now experimenting with books:\n\nForm is interesting, blog is restrictive for what he wants to write, you can throw stuff at blog &amp; narrative evolves. Book publishing going through epic change similar to magazines &amp; newspapers and he is interested in the effect of tablets/kindle's - technology creating ways around the bottlenecks of the publishing world. Now people are selling large quantities of genre work very cheaply and he sees it as similar to the origin of the paperback in the 20th century. It's no longer necessary to sell huge quantities to break even, micro-audiences mean it's possible to have a relationship with your readers, which is the way Pete has made a living, having a relationship with an audience and then someone from audience employs him, for him any new development that allows that scale is interesting &amp; books are reaching that now\n\nHe says that blogging was great in the beginning but it was just tech nerds, it became really interesting when ordinary people began to blog about their daily lives, an unmediated voice not able to happen before. It was not possible for someone like Pete to communicate globally before but it is scaleable now to write books for 50 readers although the general mindset is still that it is not worthwhile unless it's for huge numbers of readers. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n<strong>Pete's Brand</strong>\n\nPete has the same self-employment category as consultant as when he was a cash in hand gardener in the past. He will investigate whatever the next buzz term is as it's always interesting when something is given a phrase, name - he didn't want to be known as blogging consultant as all bubbles burst, so best thing to be he thinks is to be Pete, the Pete brand, \"This is Pete &amp; this is what he does\" which is hard but not important that everybody understands that, just that sufficient people understand it to make it sustainable.\n\nWe talked about the nature of On/Offline projects in relation to the <a href=\"http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/bullring-shop/\">Created in Birmingham shop</a>. This was a pop-up shop in the Bull Ring shopping centre in Birmingham which \"became ridiculously busy, got a lot of attention and made a lot of money for the artists\". In Pete's opinion the nice thing about doing stuff online is if you fail, you can just switch it off, but when you do things offline you have \"things\": infrastructure, furniture, shutting things down, payments, electricity bills, it stops being fun. People tend to think \"it worked online so we can do it offline\" but it's quite a leap from chatting on twitter to going out and committing to something, there's a lot of similarities and Pete says that he doesn't believe that offline relationships are more important than online relationships, but they are different, different barriers to entry, different filters. There's\u00a0 \"lots of euphoria about meeting wonderful people on twitter, we can do it, but when you take that offline, to do something, you realise that takes hours in the day, it takes time, it takes commitment and everybody thinking along the same lines\".\n\nWe moved on to the effects of Internet legislation on his life and ability to make a living. Pete says that he's very aware of legislation to \"control\" the Internet but also that a lot of the large cloud services such as youTube, tumblr fly in the face of the DIY publishing thing Pete is interested in.He thinks that at some point legislation will probably break the Internet and maybe the Internet will fix itself or maybe it won't, maybe we are in a golden age which will never be repeated. But he's reasonably confident that, \"the genie is out of the bottle that even if the Internet is shut down or crippled, some new technology will help people communicate and share stuff because that's the inherent need.\"\u00a0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/knH_LyvPjrk?rel=0\n\n<strong>Where's Pete heading?</strong>\n\nDabbling in art, and doing a photography school which has been publicised just by word of mouth and is doing well. He's guided by what he's interested in and what people will pay for and feels lucky, \"there is no right way, so I'm a guide - a lot of what I do is interpreting what people want and need.\"\n\nHis network was built up by accident with people who can help to turn ideas into revenue generating things, it's partly a personal marketing/branding thing and he's not a big fan of that but aware of importance of it. \"It's about taking control and responsibility for your activities and presence and not complaining that the system doesn't let you do that - forget the system, I'll make my own way. Thankfully I've been born in a situation and a country where I can do these things - and after 35 years flailing aimlessly like somebody who doesn't really know where they fit and what they are doing, I've finally landed on my feet.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-03-27 09:38:45", "updated_at": "2017-08-29 05:03:46.414803", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2010, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26492, "user_id": 157, "topic_id": 3984, "post_number": 13, "raw": "Yesterday i met Miccolis.\n\nhe was very angry for this map and GTFS.\u00a0\n\nMayor of Matera railed him!\n\n", "created_at": "2014-12-06 11:51:03", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:26.817097", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 25, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 15.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6638, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 1089, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>accommodation in Berlin</b>\n\nWill spread the word\u00a0also on our facebook group, there's a quite consistent Edgeryders presence in Berlin, who knows maybe someone will offer to host you..\n\n", "created_at": "2013-04-29 08:55:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:38.995566", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 35, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 1.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [13], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3291, "user_id": 9, "topic_id": 3258, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<span>Okay, so what\u2019s happening at unMonastery? </span>\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span><span>Over a month ago I made this </span><a href=\"/t/an-overview-of-unmonastery-matera-focused-on-june-july/3091\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span>post</span></a><span> giving an overview of plans and progress at unMonastery in June and an indication of what we had planned for July. As I write the </span><a href=\"http://therestartproject.org/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span>Restart Project</span></a><span> has arrived at unMonastery and are preparing to start their </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/661746243910921/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span>first workshop</span></a><span>. In the month that\u2019s past we had an enormously successful </span><a href=\"/t/coderdojo-matera/3222\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span>CoderDojo event</span></a><span> at a local school, which had in excess of 60 children in attendance. Marc and Piersoft are now working towards a much larger event later in the year. </span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>We\u2019ve also been playing host to Monica to support the Brazilicata festival which takes place throughout the region, bringing Brazilian musicians and performers to Italy to run an itinerant festival across multiple venues, of which unMonastery hosted the opening event at the beginning of June. </span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>Throughout June @elf and @mstn spent a significant period hidden in the caves of unMonastery staring into their respective laptops trying to conquer the unTransit app they\u2019ve been working on - occasionally escaping for a few hours for mapping excursions on the local transport system. It seemed the mapping of every bus route onto Open Street Map became quite an endeavour but many in the house pitched in to get the lines in order. You can track the progress and help out with development over at the </span><a href=\"https://github.com/unmonastery/untransit\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span>GitHub repository</span></a><span>. I believe this is nearly finished but elf and Marc will be able to give a better view of progress. </span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>From the beginning of the month we were also join by the </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/787026344641460/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span>Banana Hackers</span></a><span> - @James Lewis, Samuel and Daniel. Spinning out from sessions at OuiLabs the group have formed a sort of nomadic collective focused on \u201cbuild[ing] good stuff, and playfully exploring the 'hackathon' and 'co-living / co-working' concepts, finding out how to better build a sustainable development space, support each other and find common goals\u201d. </span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>Their stay in Matera was focused on the initial development of a new approach to managing personal data for greater privacy and user control, using linked data with a view to creating the equivalent of Mozilla Persona for profiles. Their work though at this time is not as definitive in its objectives as I may make it sound - rather they\u2019re interested in moving between different groups and locations, in order to develop technologies that make sense to the communities they encounter. Our time together included many rich and inspiring conversations - particularly in respect to reconsidering the tired \u2018Hackathon\u2019 form and how we might consider approaching it </span><a href=\"/t/naming-the-format-a-meta-idea/2997\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span>differently for LOTE4</span></a><span>. So we were very sorry to see them leave in the last days - we\u2019ve no doubt though that our paths will cross again soon and they\u2019re now in Berlin with elf for </span><a href=\"http://2014.okfestival.org/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span>OpenKnowledge Festival</span></a><span>. If you have a space of your own similar to unMonastery we highly recommend inviting them to stay with you. </span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>It\u2019d be too exhaustive to cover everything that happened in June but hopefully this gives a taste of what we\u2019ve been up to. Since we moved into July, our core concern has been on how we begin to wrap up the prototype of unMonastery, ensuring we maintain the relationships we\u2019ve built and store all of the knowledge generated. The looming fear of such an endeavour has been alleviated with the re-arrival of @bezdomny at unMonastery, who\u2019s currently in the process of starting a </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/unmonastery/photos/a.677876208952884.1073741829.427466750660499/718679218205916/?type=1\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span>co-napping revolution</span></a><span> in Matera with Maria, described to me earlier as \u201curban outreach action\u201d.

I'm not online much and live in an area with poor wifi connection. I work mostly with wood, but am exploring possibilities with Bernard of incorporating steel for something mobile. A stationary build could use many other techniques/material such as stone, straw bale, hempcrete or cob. Although cob can be tricky in Ireland because of our damp climate. The garden begins when you leave your front door. It's usually site dependant, and taking into consideration climate factors, such as wind. In Ireland the prevailing winds come from the South West.\n\nYes we have lots of unoccupied properties, but the aren't affordable and many need quite alot of restoration.\n\nI'd say any climate is suitable for a tiny house if it is well designed and built. Also looking at traditional building methods can be a good way of finding solutions to climatic challeges.\n\nBernard has been developing the Teach\u00edn idea in terms of community development and I'm adopting a supportive role.

One of the projects - <a href=\"/t/harmonious-hackathon/587/kiderwind\">Kiderwind</a>, starts on the 20th.\n\n23: Arrival of participants and conference opening in the afternoon\n\n24, 25, 26: Conference days, ending on the 26th in the afternoon. Expect an unConference here too, if someone has thoughts on how to unorganise this do share them, otherwise we may end up with a healthy dose of chaos :)\n\n27: Farewell to Matera\n\n<strong>Program</strong>\n\nThe Hackathon program is mostly done, if you however have a session to propose now\u2019s the last call to do it (<a href=\"/t/lote4-harmonious-hackathon-faq/3550\">here\u2019s how)</a>. Fellow LOTErs, please consider registering ahead for one of the 3 main <a href=\"/t/hackathon/3275\">hackathon tracks</a>, it helps plan logistics and meals.\n\nThe <a href=\"/t/lote4-the-stewardship/359/lote4-the-program\">Lote4 program </a>is in the making, over a dozen sessions have been put forward and we expect as many more to come. In the upcoming week a first draft of a proper schedule will be posted online so session leaders can ok it.\n\n<strong>Venue: unMonastery</strong>\n\nBoth the hackathon and main event will take place at unMonastery, which is also the meeting point and place to go to check in for the event (<a href=\"/t/travel-info/3277\">how to get there</a>).\n\nThe unMonastery is much more than our conference venue, it is a space with a meaningful recent history where 14 community members used to live and work in the spring of 2014. It's also equipped with bedrooms, bathrooms and a kitchen.\n\nOur hosts: unMonasterians, although not in full formation, will be there 24/24, and offered to take on the responsibility of keeping the space clean, safe and friendly, reproducing at least part of the house habits and internal \u201crules\u201d. House rules will be posted, unMonasterians (@Bembo_Davies, @katalin, @Kei, @mariabyck, @Ben, and the rest) will be easily identifiable and there to answer any questions about the unMonastery and the building. Some of their established customs, such as Zero Waste, opening and closing circles, morning practice, sharing meals, etc. will continue throughout LOTE. Most of these are open to everyone to join - but we should ask first and try not to impose. The building closes after closing circles (around 11pm) as the morning bell rings at 7am.\n\n<strong>Can you sleep at the unMonastery?</strong>\u00a0Not unless you have been invited to or agreed in advance with @Bembo_Davies. Unlike last year\u2019s Lote, the space is a core supporting pillar of the conference with its own infrastructure and house norms, rather than surrogate accommodation. Let's think of ourselves as guests.\n\nIf you have an emergency or simply can\u2019t afford any other place in Matera whatsoever, get in touch immediately at <a href=\"mailto:noemi@edgeryders.eu\">noemi@edgeryders.eu</a> and we\u2019ll find something for you.\n\nRecommended: <a href=\"http://matera.unmonastery.org/en/about\">short summary</a> about the unMonastery prototype, please read it before you come.\n\n<strong>Food</strong>\n\nCount on morning snacks, coffee and daily lunch, all served at the unMonastery during the event. Everyone who's ever experienced Italy or on the contrary, conferences where eating time was overlooked understands the need for real consideration of food, and as such we\u2019re also discussing <a href=\"/t/lote4-the-stewardship/359/food-at-lote4\">community cooked</a> meals in the evening: can you help cook, shop, even clean up after? Let Natalia and Katalin know about this as they gear up. (Sign-up sheets will be posted in the unMonastery and online.)\n\n<strong>Book your travels and accommodation!</strong>\n\nFinally, have you booked already for Matera?! Don\u2019t wait up, make travel arrangements now.. Myself, Alberto, Nadia, Matthias, @danohu, @Patrick already did so.

or maybe you search freesound, can't find what you need and have to record it - why not upload it for everyone to use in future?\n\nit's also important to give <strong>credit where it's due</strong> - so i always include the source of sounds on the credits of my films, and generally try to tell people about resources like freesound to increase their profile and use.\n\nspeaking of sharing - post any good platforms for content sharing that you know of, or other more hands-on ways to exchange material, and i'll try and find more too\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-04 12:29:24", "updated_at": "2017-09-09 08:26:03.306127", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 764, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29261, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2722, "post_number": 13, "raw": "<b>Is this still going?</b>\n\n<a href=\"/u/dina\">@dina</a>, we have not heard from you recently... is the project still live?\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-08 23:31:25", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:40.985389", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 26, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27716, "user_id": 60, "topic_id": 1323, "post_number": 17, "raw": "Alberto, the link is broken :(\n\n", "created_at": "2012-03-05 10:17:50", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:32.942206", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 7, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [23132], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29598, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2132, "post_number": 11, "raw": "<b>Some answers (not many)</b>\n\nI have decided to answer these questions in a <a href=\"/t/che-fare-application/2156/2\">comment to the wiki</a>.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-11-22 11:51:45", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:42.944751", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 28, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [29243], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2659, "user_id": 115, "topic_id": 2626, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<h4><span><em>this message has been moved from Spot the Future group to here, because webforms are strictly for marketing purposes. a different version of these pages will be made for the program itself\u00a0</em></span></h4>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h4><span>Unemployment and macro-economic deceleration in Egypt</span></h4>\n\n<span>Egypt\u2019s current difficult macroeconomic situation is largely attributed to the difficulties of adjusting to the post-Revolution situation.

Why strangers are better healers.</b>\n\nre: my observation above. I was just listening to one of my favourite podcasts Invisibilia, and their<a href=\"http://www.npr.org/programs/invisibilia/483855073/the-problem-with-the-solution?showDate=2016-07-01\"> latest episode</a> talks about mental health patients and alternatives to\u00a0failing recovery systems all over the world. Like some here already intuit, meaningful help can come from\u00a0supportive community environments (interesting examples from a\u00a0town in Belgium called Geel where families host \"patients\" for decades!, or\u00a0housing sites in NYC with 40% mentally ill people living among the others).\n\nA key takeaway for me personally is this: in a lot of cases what breaks how we think about mental illness is the belief\u00a0that it needs to be fixed, that patients\u00a0need to go back to some initial state of wellbeing;\u00a0families, through proximity and attachment,\u00a0are\u00a0most prone to exemplify this in the daily lives of someone recovering after treatment -\u00a0through a way of expressing emotions like 1) criticism 2) hostility 3) emotional overinvolvement. The mechanisms seem complex (can be subtleties, or\u00a0just body language..), but it turns out that\u00a0all 3 point to how difficult it is for family to accept and empathize,\u00a0and only load too much pressure on the person in question.\u00a0Strangers, on the other hand, do not really care THAT much and can be better healers because they \"don't see you as a bundle of problems that need to be fixed\".\u00a0\n\nBut: they do become kind of like a second family, so not complete strangers after all.\n\nI looked up some of the original studies attesting psychocultural effects on mental recovery - <a href=\"http://anthro.ucsd.edu/_files/Faculty%20Files/Jenkins/1991Anthropology,%20Expressed%20Emotion,%20and%20Schizophrenia..pdf\">pdf here.</a>\n\nHighly recommended.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-07-07 11:19:13", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:13.719797", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 332, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [12885], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6291, "user_id": 3362, "topic_id": 6258, "post_number": 1, "raw": "There have been some ideas floating around on a new possible avenue of research for the Open Insulin project. Anthony and me got in touch with Federico from <a href=\"https://digi.bio/\">digi.bio</a>, who are developing an open source microfluidic device. I\u00a0only got to writing a summary of the conversation now.\n\nIt boils down to this.\u00a0There is someone in CCL planning to generate a bunch of genetic sequences that could be potentially interesting as linkers for bringing the insulin A and B chain together more effectively. Hopefully this would result in many viable options, that have to be tested in lab experiments.\n\nTesting many options would be very resource intensive, and this is where the microfluidics chips come in. A small demo at one of the Digi.bio events can be found <a href=\"https://digi.bio/2016/01/frogger-in-droplets/\">here</a>\u00a0(cool video!). If optimized, the chips would allow for much cheaper and automated testing of the generated sequences.\n\nThe optimization part is something that we could work on\u00a0here in Belgium. Federico is based in China/Amsterdam, so he is around close enough to help us get started and betatest his chip. This would give a new dimension to replicating the work previously done by CCL, if we could test culturing the bacteria on the chips. If it works, it would even be pretty valuable step towards opening up biotech research in general.\n\nThis is getting more and more interesting...

Being edgeryders, we dived into the topics that were being discussed on the platform immediately and a comment that Patrick made resonated with me in a profound way \u2013 \u201c<strong>Should we treat ourselves as resources to be utilized by others (organisations, corporations etc) or should we utilize ourselves for our own satisfaction?</strong>\u201d This I believe is the pivotal question in understanding some of the challenges confronting us when it comes to livelihood.\n\n\u2018Making a living (paid work)\u2019 session made a lot of the challenges apparent and the solutions that came about, heard unified voices. It also answered Patrick\u2019s question and gave me the most valuable learning from \\#Lote \u2013 \u201c<strong>I am my own resource</strong>\u201d.\n\nNow, let me dive into giving this a context.\n\nBoth, society and the individual are going through a shift \u2013 adjusting or adapting to changing needs and standards. While the individual is moving at a faster pace, society is stuck in a paradigm of old rules that it is trying to apply to the changes happening around it.\n\nSome of the problems that stood out given this context -\n\n<ul><li><strong>Unpaid apprenticeship</strong> \u2013 results in a learning curve and therefore will not be monetarily rewarded. While this is acceptable, today the standard has changed to using the apprentice for \u2018donkey work\u2019 with no learning and no pay. With a high number of graduates in the market, an unpaid intern is dispensable and can be replaced with another without changing the circumstances. In such a scenario, an individual is an asset only in the context of existing institutions.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Specialization is good</strong> \u2013 Corporations find specialized employees stable and less risky. Majority of projects that require cross or multidisciplinarity are outsourced to consultancies. T-shaped employees or hybrids are therefore, not preferred within large corporations and the arena of consulting is extremely competitive \u2013 this was identified as one of the major problems in finding paid work as more and more individuals are or consider themselves hybrids. Hybrids are people who have expertise in one area and a general understanding of related fields giving them the ability to be inter- or trans-disciplinary. Society favours classical titles and hybrids fit none making it difficult for them to find a place in the traditional job market. Once again, the individual is an asset or resource in the context of existing institutions.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Have we acquired new skills that don\u2019t fit old rules anymore? </strong>This was a highly debated topic during the session. The answer still needs discussion but I do believe we found a starting point for it. The question is not of new skills \u2013 the skills remain largely the same. However, the issue is of competency. As mentioned in the earlier point, individuals are moving towards acquiring more than one skill. Hybrids are thus called because they work in between stratas. Individuals are moving towards inter or trans-disciplinarity while most institutions have not made this transition. In this scenario, individuals have started recognizing themselves as resources for their own benefit and not just as assets wrt an existing institution.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>The case of intrinsic motivation</strong> \u2013 Another point that stood out in the discussions was that most hybrids consider themselves intrinsically motivated. What drives them is continuous learning, passion for their work and creative/personal satisfaction. Money was not a driver but was seen as something that is required to sustain oneself enough to continue satiating the above-mentioned drivers.</li></ul>The solutions that echoed though the session came about to alleviate the above mentioned problems through 3 possible ways that need to work in tandem and not in silos \u2013\n\n<ul><li><strong>Dialogue</strong> \u2013 Most participants believed that starting constructive dialogues is the need of the hour that transforms hybrids from outsiders in the traditional system to insiders. What we need is a multi-stakeholder issue based approach.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Entrepreneurship</strong> \u2013 The intrinsic motivation drivers are powerful for some hybrids to start their own companies or work as freelancers to satiate their creative needs as well as monetary needs to sustain themselves. However, not every hybrid is an entrepreneur and therefore a majority is still stuck without a way out.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Network economy</strong> \u2013 the 3<sup>rd</sup> option that was most voiced is the idea of a network economy that connects dots in silos and creates a thriving environment to collaborate, share skills, create alternative methods of self-sustainability. In this scenario, the individual becomes his or her own resource and works to benefit oneself through collaboration. Within this idea of network economy, the exchange can happen is two ways \u2013 1. Pure barter: e.g. \u201cI will design your website for space to live\u201d; 2. Create a\u00a0 new kind of organization that is multi- or trans-dsiciplnary thus changing the traditional models and create employment within this new model for the growing number of hybrids (this is also attached to entrepreneurship).</li></ul>The discussion here is still rudimentary, I believe and needs validation. Can we do that, edgeryders? Hope to hear what you think and engage in further value-enriching discussions from here on.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-20 17:14:25", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:05.842719", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 934, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 46.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22256, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2954, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>You can come aboard too!</b>\n\nThanks, <a href=\"/u/amiridina\">@amiridina</a>, but why \"good luck\"?

Currently, this variety is made of top-down mode. There are elites, then those who execute the orders and workers more or less useful, then further down, the sick, the insane, the unemployed, the unable, the unstable.\n\nWould it not be better to think that our societies have varied needs of humans, with varied skills, occupying various places, but everyone is needed to make our societies function?\n\nThese varieties can also be experienced as a variety of businesses, in the products and services they have to offer, but also in their modes of organization. Here is a link on the review of a books of authors on this topic:\n\n<a href=\"http://michelvolle.blogspot.fr/2012/04/blanche-segrestin-et-armand-hatchuel.html\">http://michelvolle.blogspot.fr/2012/04/blanche-segrestin-et-armand-hatchuel.html</a>\n\nand \u00a0<a href=\"http://cgs-mines-paristech.fr/tmci/\">http://cgs-mines-paristech.fr/tmci/</a>\n\nAll periods of change are characterized by the prominence of new models of human beings, new men and the strengthening of old models. Everyone wonders what is the best Man for the times ahead. And everyone wants to participate in the definition, wants to put away important qualities and eliminate behaviors, ways of doing things considered detestable.\n\nAt a time when Europe and the world is being transformed and reshaped, we can choose an approach that will put all these competing models, struggling against each other into something mostly violent, to be the only Man possible and eliminate others. We may also decide that these definitions, these fights, these wars are not just for authorized persons, philosophers, men of science, religious, political leaders, but for everyone.\n\n<strong>Value proposition / Short definition</strong> \u00a0\u00a0The Game of the Man, proposed on Edgeryders by philosopher <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/users/michel-filippi\">Michel Filippi</a>, is useful because it allows to designing different types of men we need in a society that is, in principle heterogeneous.\n\n<strong>Features</strong>\u00a0 We can decide that these approaches are not civilized because they ignore a solid basis of our science and what is worth being transmitted around the world to come. No human being is able to completely described by the Real from a single model. Also no human being is able to completely describe Mankind from a single model.\n\nWe will be civilized if we can design different Men and articulate them to best describe humanity, so that every human being may choose one of these men, and try to integrate them inside him/her.\n\n<strong>About the Game\u00a0\u00a0 </strong>Describe what could your man and what he cannot do.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Support your description with examples of experience.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Justify your description by neuro-cognitive and physical models.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Describe the education process necessary to develop the skills of this man or to eliminate defects of the human whom he will embody.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Show how this man can live by converting resources to products, businesses, institutions,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The qualities that you set, the defects that you want to be eliminate must be possible, for your \u00a0man to live.\n\n<strong>For whom</strong>\u00a0 For everyone.\n\n<strong>Value for citizens</strong>\u00a0\u00a0 Define oneself with qualities and potential. Recognize oneself in one (or several) human model. \u00a0Upon learning about the opportunities, grow as much as possible, towards full potential for each citizen.\n\n<strong>Value for governance</strong>\u00a0 It identifies opportunities for development of the human race, and allows everyone to choose their ideal model of Man, and attempt to reach the highest vision of themselves (towards the goal that every citizens reaches his/her full potential).\n\n<strong>Why is it different</strong>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This project is different because through a game, it allows everyone, every citizen, to find his/her place in society. This project, based on diversity and living together, allows each individual to be valued. Through exploration of the various models of Man, it allows to identify how each type of human being contributes to society, in his/her own way.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-12 05:10:06", "updated_at": "2017-09-06 07:25:48.176132", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 843, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7800, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 5098, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Thank you Anna</b>\n\nLots of love to you and the little one from Hamburg.

When you chose to follow your guts and commit yourself to visions, it is quite probable that you will be confronted with painful failure. No projects, no failure. So here is my little, personal story on failure:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>I dropped out of what could've been a (brilliant?) career as an academic: never finished my PhD and used my last years of scholarship money to support voluntary activities as an activist in a cultural association. The aim was to convince citizens, local administrators and cultural operators that Matera could be an ideal candidate for the European Capital of Culture title in 2019. It was 2009, and the beginning of the successful candidacy of Matera 2019. But success reached it's highest peak, and we are now assisting to the downfall. <a href=\"/en/lote5/european-capitals-of-culture-failure-is-not-about-losing-the\">More during LOTE5</a>.</li>\n\n<li>Two years later, once the official bid of the city was finally launched, it was time to move back to Brussels and finish the PhD... but... got involved in an ambitious project once I was back in town. Opening a bar and art-caf\u00e9 in the center of the city with some friends. The plan was to finish my PhD while launching and managing the venue. What actually happened is that I got eaten up by it. One year later we were closing down the venue and the company, I had lost 10 kilos and simply burnt out. Ended up without a PhD, with a closed bar and a failed company, with all the financial and emotional consequences that you can imagine.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThings are starting to settle now, but I cannot help asking myself if this is happening simply because I quit going for ambitious projects, swapped the love for visions for safety and adapted to a \"normal life\" which had always freaked me out before. I cannot help missing the struggle, the passion, the commitment, and the sense of shared vision with a broader community. The individualism that goes hand in hand with a safe standard life makes me think, especially when I stand looking at how the vision behind Matera 2019 is being teared down by ego, incompetencies and incapacity to delegate and truly open up to horizontality and decentralization. I am sure that these thoughts will find food for thought during the \\#LOTE5.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-01-17 15:45:21", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:49.678321", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 411, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 6.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 2945], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26361, "user_id": 1467, "topic_id": 2006, "post_number": 18, "raw": "<b>The dogs may bark but the caravan moves on</b>\n\nFairly new to ER and DEFINITELY one of the reasons I joined was the intelligent and insightful contributions by Nadia and Alberto ~ made me think ER and unMon are great concepts with some big hearts and brains behind it all.\n\nFollowed the 'corporate shell' debate with fascination having 30 years of being an Occupational Health nurse and seeing how corporations de-sensitise managers and use up their workforce WHILE at the same time showing the spirit of enterprise that socially-oriented outfits and lumbering institutions could gain much from.

Meanwhile, it's reasonable to question if sources like Rockefeller money is expedient or unacceptable to keep the lights on, I see both sides. But these two are giving themselves commendably to finding work-arounds to keep us rolling and it would be understandable if they sometimes feel taken for granted. We don't, we think you're both brilliant. And so is the person questioning the accuracy of our moral compass so don't retreat into silence, we value your voice.\n\nDavid Ridge\n\n", "created_at": "2013-10-04 15:00:15", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:26.036639", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 338, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 15.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1487, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21264, "user_id": 75, "topic_id": 2859, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>AMAZING.</b>\n\nyou guys rock!\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-26 18:36:53", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:58.263400", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 8, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7932, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1316, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Ovviamente vincente</b>\n\n(questa la scrivo in italiano, non avrebbe senso altrimenti)\n\nCiao Maria Chiara! Ho visto il sito: bellissima idea, ovviamente vincente. Perch\u00e9 avete ragione, non ha pi\u00f9 senso parlare di fuga di cervelli; parliamo, pi\u00f9 appropriatamente, di circolazione di cervelli. Una citt\u00e0, per avere futuro, deve incoraggiare i suoi cittadini a partire, ed essere pronta ad accoglierli se decidono di tornare; inoltre, deve essere generosa nell'adottare i migranti. Hai letto <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/New-Argonauts-Regional-Advantage-Economy/dp/0674022017\">The New Argonauts</a> di Annalee Saxenian? \u00c8 un libro molto utile, in cui si capisce bene come l'industrializzazione ITC di alcuni paesi emergenti (Taiwan, Israele, India e Cina continentale) sia stata fatta da ingegneri del posto, che erano emigrati nella Silicon Valley e c'erano rimasti magari per venti anni.\n\nAnch'io sono nato a Bologna. I miei genitori mi hanno portato via che ero molto piccolo, ma poi ci sono tornato da adulto, e ci ho abitato durante gli anni chiave dell'avventura dei Modena City Ramblers, dal 1993 al 1998. Nel 2001, meno di un anno dopo avere lasciato il gruppo, ho lasciato anche l'Emilia, per andare prima a Milano e \u00a0poi, l'anno scorso, qui in Francia.\n\nL'Emilia \u00e8 il solo luogo al mondo dove mi sento veramente a casa: ci sono nato e cresciuto, ci sono nati e cresciuti entrambi i miei genitori, tutti e quattro i miei nonni, gli otto bisnonni e cos\u00ec via, fino a non si sa quale generazione. Per\u00f2 - diciamoci la verit\u00e0 - non \u00e8 un posto molto adatto a un'impostazione aperta e moderna come quella di Exbo. Io me ne sono andato con un po' di amaro, perch\u00e9 Bologna mi era diventata insopportabile: pigra, perbenista, razzista, provinciale, con una visibile preminenza della rendita immobiliare (quella che Silvia Ballestra, raccontando la sua esperienza di studentessa fuori sede in citt\u00e0, definiva \"naziprop\") sul lavoro produttivo. E in pi\u00f9, insopportabile nel suo continuare a ritenersi \"isola felice\", tutto va bene madama la marchesa.\u00a0\n\nCome vedi non sono molto obiettivo, sono luoghi e persone che sento troppo vicini per l'obiettivit\u00e0! Forse voi avete trovato una buona dimensione, un po' fuori e un po' dentro, in grado di esercitare un po' di pressione ma senza che sia questione di vita o di morte.\u00a0\n\nCome sta andando? Ho visto dal sito che siete soddisfatti dell'assemblea, e c'\u00e8 un accenno a \"tre cantieri di lavoro aperti\" con qualche assessore.

This led straight into individual and collective reflection and the mapping of questions that mattered to participants. Here, three key issues emerged, which participants gathered in three working groups to address.\n\nOne group tackled the question of <strong>\"How can we provide care and preventative care adequately and accessibly?\"</strong> in a process of collective brainstorming and idea development. As a central starting point was the agreement that care and prevention services should be provided by real people for real people, and thus to counteract the further dehumanization in care - both toward those being cared for, but also the caregivers themselves, as has been spreading as a result of the savings and efficiency measures, particularly in the public sector care, such as hospitals and nursing homes,. Based on this arose an idea for central, physical places and spaces in which cross-generational knowledge sharing communities with a decentralized \"bottom-up\" structure can develop. This should activate the local community at large and encourage more people to visit and thus bringing them together. Simultaneously, through the use of modern telecommunications and the Internet, communities that are located in remote areas will be included \u2013 the challenge of inadequate or even non-existent Internet connections in these areas could be countered by open-source technology solutions, such as balloons that are equipped with Internet. The necessary financial resources could be generated by a crowdfunding campaign, also to generate more public attention, especially online, for teaching/learning/exchange spaces for this innovation and strengthen the cohesion of the existing community. A key component of the engagement in these areas could be workshops of all types and themes to be organized, offered and held by participants themselves. These spaces could make a contribution to the initial formulation of questions, because a social community that is open and accessible for all faces the challenge of accessibility to prevention and care, supported by the Internet. Care and prevention again become a matter for the community, and are thus realized in a humane and proportionate way.\n\nThis common \"bottom-up\" structure was made tangible in a first prototyping, which opened the question \"How can we engage individuals to support these structures, even if they ostensibly do not (yet) benefit from them?\"\n\nThe prototype incorporated the approach of small and relatively autonomous systems where the supply and demand of communities for health and social themes can not only be met, but also that such knowledge can be bundled onsite and via the internet everyone has access to the spaces. Decisions about the design of health promoting coexistence are shaped by the particpating actors themselves. Finally, assumptions were formulated, which should be examined, scrutinized and discussed in the network in order to make this approach more effective and more efficient. Because even subtle or unconscious perceptions and attitudes can potentially be found in each concept, it needs to be balanced by many, diverse and also conflicting perspectives on the concept to make it more resistant. It was also reflected that a certain basic attitude is required of all potential participants to form these care and prevention networks. Another important point is posed by the question of: \"How can momentum be created for these spaces and networks?\"\n\nAnother group addressed the question of: <strong>\"How can we, based on commonalities, learn more from each other?\"</strong> In a idea development and brainstorming process on this issue, the importance of local and personal interaction was recognized. This includes the networking of stakeholders and users, potentially through an interactive map on the Internet such as used by www.berlinimwandel.de. It also requires the organizing of engaging workshops where actors can share their enthusiasm for relevant topics with others by presenting them as relevant themes, and optionally also to demonstrate activities to make them tangible. In addition, activities such as role reversals to expand the individuals' horizons of experience are possible, as is done, for example, in working with \"age suits\" \u2013 young people slip into full-body suits equipped with weights to enable the experience of having an aged body.\n\nIn a first prototype lifting the existing resources were, theoretically and practically, visualized through a mapping of individual and collaborative networking, both online and offline and person. This process led to the realization that everything is actually there to the realization of this idea already what is needed, when the dedicated actors gathered as OPENandChange workshop, work together and share their resources and combine theory with practice. These assumptions to check it seems important in the first step to begin with themselves, so to make the possibility of designing a different world tangible. This iterative process leads to fresh insights. But the community-based approach not only leads to new insights, but can lead to a higher incidence of fun and joy, and ultimately health and well-being by strengthening group working experiences.\n\nThe third working group focused on the question: <strong>\"How can we increase the societal appreciation for a public welfare oriented social system?\"</strong> Also during this idea development and brainstorming process, the need for people to meet in person in \"their\" area, city, country was emphasized. For example, working in interactive groups can lead to an intensification of togetherness and can make prevention and care topic. The supposedly negative connotations otherwise associated with these concepts such as disease, death and a feeling of helplessness are thus transformed. A positive attitude towards the subject is promoted, fears can be reduced, and at the same time the respect and appreciation for the work of nurses and caregivers is increased. In particular, a playful approach to the subject can support this project and convey the idea that all can benefit. Another important aspect for answering the initial question is to explore the current actual situation in care. The question as to why the appreciation in prevention and care sector is so low can lead to valuable information to help find solutions. In prototyping, the motto of \"living appreciation\" was made tangible and concrete: Care and prevention spaces would be established in the middle of society, fulfilling the basic needs of all, which ensures the participation of all so that this approach corresponds to the wishes of all and fulfills their needs. To test this assumption requires a thorough basic research of existing resources, as well as bureaucratic hurdles, and to examine stakeholders, especially those who are not participating.\n\nBased on the work of the three groups, the following definition of the problems was generated:\n\n<strong>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Dehumanization of health and social systems </strong>\n\n<strong>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The focus on treating symptoms rather than promoting healthy lifestyles </strong>\n\n<strong>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Privatization and capitalization of public goods, which should be accessible to all </strong>\n\nThe concrete solution that the participants collectively devised, states that:\n\n<strong>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0All we need is there if we work together and share our resources</strong>\n\n<strong>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0A paradigm shift is needed: \"From Pathogenesis to Salutogenesis\" \u2013 Solidary Health Promotion System with Global Knowledge Network and Local Action Spaces </strong>\n\n<strong>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Working \"with people for people\" and connect visionaries, experts, institutions and places through concrete actions </strong>\n\nThis solution leads to the following intended:\n\n<strong>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Employing existing treasures: Mapping for individual and community networking, online and in person, in theory and practice </strong>\n\n<strong>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Practising appreciation: Create care and prevention spaces in the middle of society to fulfill the basic needs of all and create new incentive/recognition structures in the long term </strong>\n\n<strong>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Local systemic change: Developing new skills, resources and infrastructure that can be used by all of us: children, young people, adults, seniors (people in all phases of life). </strong>\n\nStrong arguments for the proposal are:\n\n<strong>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Bottom-up structure with small relatively autonomous systems, who self-regulate the supply and demand of health and social services for individuals and communities </strong>\n\n<strong>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Only through shared ownership effectiveness and sustainability can this be secured </strong>\n\nOur approaches, technologies and tactics are:\n\n<strong>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Active participation of ALL leads to a prototype that works for the majority and meets their needs (human-centered development of global platform and local spaces) </strong>\n\n<strong>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Collective, iterative structure combining theory and practice </strong>\n\n<strong>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Global Knowledge Network \u2013 CAREPEDIA: bundled knowledge (Internet / platform) all have access to the \"central office\" </strong>\n\n<strong>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Local Action Spaces: Locally designed and managed spaces for health-promoting coexistence \"From Pathogenesis to Salutogenesis\"</strong>\n\nWe believe our solution will work because: We have existing needs (more than 80% of people want a functional and appreciative system for care and prevention ) and real effects from a dehumanized health and care system. We know many people and institutions that are interested in cooperating and who would gladly contribute their respective expertise. Another world is within reach. There are many projects and movements to prove it. We shall make this even more visible. Everything we need is already there. We need the courage to try it, to experience and live it. We can make an active contribution to this. Financial resources are not a challenge or necessity to achieve this.\n\nAs expected results \u2013 in the context of existing cases \u2013 we use the following examples: Successful EcoVillages such as Mondragon (a community in the Basque Country without police). Giving spaces, exchange meets and free shops. Micro-agriculture in the city. Urban gardening. Community-supported agriculture creates new relationships between city and land. There are urban farming initiatives in Detroit, critical consumption movements in Italy (GAS), alternative currency systems such as WIR in Switzerland, and solidarity networks for food supply and health clinics in Greece, as well as Networks such as SOLIDAGO and Artabana in Germany. And many more.\n\nFurthermore, our proposal is confirmed by literature and scientific consensus such as in the field of neuronal research: Fear paralyzes reason and creativity and leads to depression due to stress and alienation . Yet willingness for lifelong learning, creates new neural connections. Further scientific findings such as the Hierarchy of Needs Maslow, the concept of The Ever-Present Origin (Stuttgart 1949-1953) by Jean Gebser, the classic theories of J.M. Baldwin, G.H. Mead, J. Piaget (The Psychology of the Child) and L. Kohlberg as well as related work by C. Gilligan, F. Oser and M. Parsons. Also the literature and research by Ken Wilber, Aurobindo Ghose, Ervin L\u00e1szl\u00f3, Don Beck, and Michael Murphy; \u00a0work on Emotional Intelligence by Daniel Goleman, und the research by Kropotkin, who proved that cooperation is more important than competition in the animal kingdom and is effective for the survival of the group. Also the ample literature on the topics of sustainable lifestyles, Solidarity economy, Holacracy and Sociocracy support our suggested solution.\n\nHowever, it is necessary to keep sight of the risks. Here there are also a number of examples that could occur either externally or internally: The risk that corporations hijack the ideas and commercialize them, such as happened with Carsharing and CoLiving. External factors such as war, social conflicts, the collapse of the financial system, climate change and its consequences, privatization of public goods such as drinking water, and environmental disasters could endanger our plans.\n\nBut also our inner monsters, such as greed and the hunger for power \u00a0could torpedo the project. There is always a danger that the idea is not accepted, that the needs of the stakeholders are not met or met only partially; that there are \"too many cooks\" or that the concept can not be implemented due to conflicting priorities, or dependencies between partners and networks arise.\n\nYet we see possibilities to work against these risks. Reality has proven that it already works, and many people are working toward this aim worldwide:\n\nWe are many! We cooperate and we are a network. We have sufficient human capacity. Our approach is flexible and can be used in existing structures and institutions. Dependence on existing systems and infrastructures can be solved via an \"open-source\" approach that leads to a multiplying effect, where copying is allowed and actively encouraged.\n\nThis leads to the reduction of fears, relaxation, deceleration, satisfaction and happiness. There will be systemic relief or elimination of the superfluous, as well as personal and societal development potential through inclusion and the integration of \"fringe groups\" such as unemployed, refugees or marginalized citizens.\n\nFor evaluation it is intended to study these criteria and assumptions in order to confirm them: Self-organization in groups works. Positions, attitudes and values are part of a common vision. Skills are included and allocated according to an open source principle. The new system or the new platform reaches more people and connects more participants than previous systems or platforms. There are spaces where encounters already take place. Spaces can be created where encounters are possible. Spaces that meet various needs lead to added value for all.\n\n<strong>Interestingly, it can be stated that all three working groups arrived at very similar approaches and ideas, problems and solutions during this intense, exciting and inspiring eight hour workshop: A change of perspective and a paradigm shift is required - instead of focusing on fighting disease, working towards the promotion of health!</strong>\n\nCaroline Paulick-Thiel &amp; Jahn Harrison, nextlearning e.V.\n\nTranslation: Alexander Paulick-Thiel\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-28 16:36:35", "updated_at": "2018-05-24 10:59:15.772783", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2346, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 6.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24774, "user_id": 9, "topic_id": 1820, "post_number": 11, "raw": "<b>Thoughts and actions!</b>\n\n<font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><font style=\"font-size: 10pt\">Ilaria, firstly thank you so much for your thoughtful and comprehensive response, you allow a lot of space for me to expand on my initial post \u2013 for that reason I've been exceptionally slow to reply, so apologies!\n\nTo begin, you're quite right to be confused, I sat down and attempted to produce a 'Landing Strip' and it got complicated \u2013 looking at the core of unMonastery the relationships between organisations is dense. </font></font>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><font style=\"font-size: 10pt\">Here's a <a href=\"http://www.unmonastery.eu/pdf/org-chart-v1.pdf\">link to my first iteration </a></font></font><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><font style=\"font-size: 10pt\">covering who's involved \u2013 it falls short of covering everything though.</font></font>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><font style=\"font-size: 10pt\">You identify a key problem when you say \u201c<font color=\"#000000\">The core ambivalence of the unMon lies, in my eyes, in this semi-public semi-hacker, half voluntary half paid situation... \u2026.if there is a paid contract with someone, that makes that person in charge and responsible of giving input and directions\u201d.\n\nThe conflation of paid individual and individual with authority to act, is logical but in the case of unMonastery (and other projects of this nature) is a hindrance to the productivity the overall project might achieve. One I'm attempting to solve in writing these posts \u2013 I for example am not paid, at LOTE2 there was a strong collective effort to pull unMonastery together by a mix of EdgeRyders, which gave us the push we needed for the Matera prototype. At the end of LOTE2 I said that I would take responsibility for the project, which at the time meant; doing all the boring administration so others who are interested in the project can just do the fun bits. What this has come to mean is carrying the majority of the weight, through both administration and decision making, decisions that I would prefer to be making with a larger group of people.\n\nUnMonastery is a concept with strong foundations and a promising proposition that many people care about and have contributed to. It's an idea that was willed into existence by the spirit of EdgeRyders and as a result it now has a set of very real responsibilities to fulfil, principally at this point to the people of Matera. I say this in response to some of your points, trust that I do not take this for granted nor lightly, I am very conscious of what has been given to us thus far by the people of Matera.</font></font></font>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<font color=\"#000000\"><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><font style=\"font-size: 10pt\">Fundamentally; No one owns the concept of unMonastery, like hackerspaces (which have heavily influenced the concept to date) it is hoped that others will take the idea and run with it, remix it and redistribute it for the benefit of towns and cities throughout Europe.\n\nMy personal position is this; there is no hierarchy in the unMonastery, anyone willing to contribute constructive and pragmatic building techniques is welcomed with open arms and invited in as an equal partner. Only in instances where individuals act to raise polemical issues around hypothetical scenarios, would I suggest that the project is not for them, since it is predicated on pragmatism and doing. My question though is this; How do we communicate this openness clearly? And once it is communicated, how do we create the infrastructure by which this can actually happen?\n\nI've discussed this issue recently with @Noel Hatch, concluding that we need to design an effective 'permission mechanism' \u2013 that assures and enables individuals to continually contribute and make decisions.\n\nMy first pass at this has to been to create an '<a href=\"http://unmonastery.eu/LAB/\">unMonastery Lab</a>'</font></font></font><font color=\"#000000\"><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><font style=\"font-size: 10pt\">\u00a0\u2013 which in essence is just a wiki deployment on the website. But it could be much more, it could become a lively open access space to collaboratively design the unMonastery in advance of its first iteration and with a view towards future iterations. I would like for us all from this point on figure out how to organise this space; literally how do we breakdown the initial categories?\n\n\u201cCan we start building on the unMon when the people that are going to be apart of it have not been selected yet?\u201d </font></font></font>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><font style=\"font-size: 10pt\"><font color=\"#000000\">Yes absolutely, as I've stated above. Matera is the first iteration and people on the ground will always have the option to dismiss propositions or design concepts in the same way that monks were free to reject 'the rule' in the initial establishment of monastic life. It is more likely though that anything built now will be used, modified or adapted. If it's not used in Matera, it might be used for an alternative iteration. </font></font></font>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<font color=\"#000000\">\u201c<font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><font style=\"font-size: 10pt\">I don't get how the online participants are going to collaborate with the selected unMonastarians. For example, I would love to commit to Facilitator of Communication and Community: who do I say this too?\u201c</font></font></font>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><font style=\"font-size: 10pt\"><font color=\"#000000\">You just said it, so great, welcome on board, it's great to have you here in an official capacity as Facilitator of Communication and Community (you'll have an email address shortly). As for the former question, I don't know yet, but I guess as Project Facilitator and Facilitator of Communication and Community it's our responsibility to figure it out!\n\n\u201cAnd if it's for funding the idea, and the idea passes, would you (in general) go for funding a social enterprise? the unMon as a spin-off of a spin-off?\u201d\n\nPotentially yes, providing such a model wouldn't on others spinning off their own unMonasteries autonomously and without bureaucratic hindrance. </font></font></font>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><font style=\"font-size: 10pt\"><font color=\"#000000\">One thing that has really excited me of late is the realisation of how unMonastery can act as a conceptual tool for incubating new ideas \u2013 because there are actually very few ideas out there that propose a holistic framework by which to re-imagine living in the world, you realise there is so much stuff that could be built. Many of these new things may be provoked by the idea of unMonastery but they may also be capable of living a life of their own. Recent discussions with Gaia about unMonastery in-a-box has bought light to this realisation.</font></font></font>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<font color=\"#000000\">\u201c<font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><font style=\"font-size: 10pt\">task model: yes!

Natural disasters tend to occur repeatedly in the same areas: Italy is a seismic area, as Africa pushes it northwards 1 cm a year, and earthquakes occur over and over again over the centuries in the same areas. Matera has another structural problem, that of flash floods. Irregular rainfall, steep terrain and the fact the the whole Sassi are more or less covered in stone, hence waterproof, lead to water running downhill very fast and all concentrating in few funneling points (20-30 minutes between the start of the raiinstorm and the full force of the flash flood). In fact, the only two drivable roads in the Sassi are repurposed riverbeds!\n\nUnfortunately, people forget quicklu, so they don't prepare. In 1917 three people died in a cave during a flash flood: that cave is now a quality restaurant. A flash flood on a Sunday lunchtime might lead to endangering 50 people.\n\nWhat to do in the event of a flash flood:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>go uphill, never down</li>\n\n<li>if you are driving, don't leave the car antywhere where it might oppose resistance to the current \u2013 it will transform your car in a missile.</li>\n\n<li>don't enter caves and underground environments (ipogei).</li>\n\n<li>(in the long run) plant trees to slow down water. Matera has an ambitious plan to plant 100,000 trees which just started deployment.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Challenge</strong>: a further safety hazard comes from the monolinguism of the Italian media. In the event of a disaster, the radio/TV will be putting word out in Italian only. This is not good enough. Matera is visited by many international tourists; also, it hosts a community of about 800 Chinese, some of whom don't speak Italian. So, edgeryders and unMonasterians are asked to design pictograms (no words, just images) that can show people what to do in the event of a flash flood. During the session we sketched several proposals. The challenge now is for people with design skills to polih one or ore of them and pass them over to Pio.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/4/459a7af2ef8f151d2901a4b73af489ab03e79d4b.JPG\" width=\"690\" height=\"462\"><br>\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-11-03 09:12:11", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:11.335883", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 400, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 20.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31899, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 4433, "post_number": 25, "raw": "<b>Wow.

It is easier with time, although to be fair, at times one wants to smash a computer screen when reading somebody's comment. Self-control is bliss.\n\n<a href=\"/u/arthurd\">@ArthurD</a>, what is there to say? What bothers me is the way you do it, and I took deep offense. Gratuitous accusations. Words are free, but powerful, especially when thrown with nothing to back them up: positioning, a link, an argument, a willingness to explain yourself etc. 3 lines and then other people to clean the mess. Sounds easy. And while there are things left unspoken that would shine light on professionalism or lack of, I would NEVER say those things in public out of respect for you and what we have been building, because they shouldn't reflect on ER LbG as a whole, less of the community; they speak of team expectations left unmet and egos.\u00a0\n\n<a href=\"/u/billy_smith\">@Billy_Smith</a>\u00a0<a href=\"/u/katalin\">@katalin</a>\u00a0It saddens me that you want to be the ones throwing stones.. \u00a0I don't want anyone's rights removed, that is not constructive, nor does it build bridges at all! and especially not\u00a0Nadia's since she is currently doing the heavylifting in key ER LbG projects and we need to be able to operate and welcome newcomers on board.

Why is that lack of transparency if we went ahead and announced it as soon as it was formal?

We are not an organization but a group of friends trying to help people that were in need after the earthquake.\u201d \u00a0\n\n<em>And what brought the group together? </em>\n\n\u201cI think the idea came when my friends decided we should help the people affected by the quake. Everyone wanted to help but no one knew how to. So around the fourth day, five or six of us got together and bought some tarpaulin and food and went to one of the affected areas. The core group of people was around 10. But each day we had 20-30 people who assisted us in visiting these areas,\u201d says Srijan.\n\n<strong>The visits and rescue work</strong>\n\n\u201cWhat we basically did was we decided to provide tarpaulin for the affected people. Later we started providing food, blankets, mattresses, hygiene kits and so on by either purchasing them ourselves \u00a0or from other organizations that wanted to help. We used to decide on the location on the evening before our trip. Usually some of our friends would come up with a place and local contact person of that place. And we would generally target a population of around 50-70 families per day.\u201d \u2013 Srijan\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a4607d9ffbaad35b6f9b720cb5f460cbae223394.jpg\" width=\"330\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\n<strong>Relief and You</strong>\n\n\u201cI was really overwhelmed by the spirit shown by people like us to reach out to victims and help them. I have seen people like us working day and night to help people they didn't even know. So I was really inspired by the unity and devotion showed by our community to help each other. On the field, there were people in VDCs that had formed organizations that was really helpful for us as they had lists of all the families with proper details. To see that unity in people and the courage to take responsibility and initiative was something that I had not imagined. One thing I learned from the experience was organizing and management. I had no idea that I would be able to coordinate the efforts of the entire group.\u201d\u2013 Srijan\n\n<strong>Life changing experiences</strong>\n\n<em>I asked Srijan to share a story that stuck with him and coincidentally, his story was of the same individual that Abhinav had talked about. </em>\n\n\u201cWe went to Alapot VDC near Sankhu and we had a local contact person there, Mr. Bharat Nuwakoti. At the end of the day, we provided Bharat Dai with tarpaulin, food, mattress and blankets. A guy came along from another ward of the same VDC and told us he had nothing and asked for anything that was left. We had ran out of supplies for that day. But Bharat Dai put all the stuffs we gave him on the ground and told that man he could take anything he wanted. The guy himself was an earthquake victim yet he wanted to help others. So that was some experience. It kept me going for the rest of our efforts. Mr. Bharat Nuwakoti will always have my respect.\u201d \u2013 Srijan\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/4/4ece48f81ee57a7460355175f1300a89bb33a553.jpg\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\n<strong>Relief aid needs coordination </strong>\n\n\u201cThere were so many organizations that were providing relief materials. The only thing I regret is not helping all the families we could have given correct information. So if I were to do it again, I would have contacted them with proper details so that we would have gotten the supplies to help as many people as possible.\n\n\u201cWe did meet army personnel in a village beyond Tokha. They were building shelters for victims. After they had finished their work, they handed us a list of families that they had built shelters for and we coordinated with them to provide relief materials to other villagers.\u201d \u2013 Srijan\n\n<strong>Inspiration</strong>\n\n<em>The best way to move forward is to get inspired by fellow workers who have contributed to this purpose. Inspiration comes in many forms - sometimes it is in the group and at times outside it.</em>\n\n\"We have been coordinating with a group called \"Aid for Nepal\". The group was formed by people I have know from my college days. My friends, seniors and juniors were part of the group. They helped us with funds for relief work. They also sent teams to places like Gorkha, Sindhupalchok and other affected areas.\n\n\u201cThere is also a group called Kalyani for women who provided us with hygiene kits for families. They have been very helpful and they have been providing supplies to a lot of groups. Along with that, I would really like to thank all my friends and their friends who worked with me in Kathmandu Relief Team.\u201d \u2013 Srijan\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/0/099c36251d996db6dd1cf2398df0b23b42157a80.jpg\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\n<em>Again, we have a lead.

What makes someone an Edgeryder:</strong>\u00a0Edgeryders community has blurred edges, you never have a clear in and out -only a position in an online network that changes over time e.g. in this daily updated network analysis of the Edgeryders conversation\u00a0<a href=\"http://edgeryders.edgesense.spazidigitali.com\">http://edgeryders.edgesense.spazidigitali.com</a>\n\n<strong>2. Ownership and co-creation within communities -</strong> we identified some open questions and discussed what can be learned from the ongoing tensions around the unMonastery project.\n\n<strong>3. How to respond to calls for clarity</strong>- A suggestion was made to define Clarity as availability to answer questions, rather than have all questions answered.\n\n<strong>4</strong>. <strong>To discuss or not to discuss- </strong>Sometimes discussions do not solve things/bring solutions, but cause more problems and every minute spent discussing is a minute not spent on other things.\n\n<strong>5. Collaborative processes and where to turn for help when community dynamics turn strange.</strong>\n\n<strong>6. Adela's Project:</strong>Adela wants to fight against fact that more people complaining about things but not doing anything about it. She wants to bring together people from different places and fields of practice, to find opportunities for creating more social cohesion together. She wants to partner with Edgeryders for her project. Someone suggested checking out <a href=\"/t/lote4-the-stewardship/359\">LOTE events</a> for possible collaboration, maybe even running the next one in Romania, maybe even in Cluj. Something we think\u00a0<a href=\"/u/noemi\">@Noemi</a>\u00a0might approve of :)\n\n<strong>What makes someone an Edgeryder?</strong> You are an edgeryder if you say you are- it's self-selection. This is critical because there is no need to draw a hard line, people move in the network. <strong>Communities like ours have blurred edges-</strong> you never have a clear in and out. It doesn't matter if you are in or out, only you location in the network. And this is not some mysterious, static position...it's even visible e.g. this daily updated network analysis of the Edgeryders conversation http://edgeryders.edgesense.spazidigitali.com. That said, <strong>there are some values that many Edgeryders seem to have in common</strong>.For example Personalisation. Most people take certain templates for how you should live as a given. This does not seem to be the case for many Edgeryders. In the call all the participants have been experimenting with their own lifestyles (moving out of the country,co-living, nomadism) and working or living with others in unconventional constellations.\n\n<strong>Ownership and co-creation within a community is a delicate issue.</strong> Very difficult to identify who are active community members doing things, are they doing it as their own projects, or under an organizational umbrella. How can we ensure people are not excluded from accessing the value they contributed towards building open community projects as projects progress?\u00a0How do we ensure that all contributions made at all phases in the evolution of projects are acknowledged and rewarded, as projects continue?\u00a0How do we frame that success? What is the time-frame we are looking at? - rewards: is it an individual responsibility to make our needs tangible to other co-creators in this process?\n\nEdgeryders is a still new community. it is hard to have all the answers. But it is good to ask questions.\u00a0\u00a0How to balance the community members being totally free to do what they want, and protect the collaborative processes.\u00a0Example: licensing of open source software. You think these people doing the open source are good people and would not steal the software. But it does happen.\u00a0If the community starts to behave strangely, who do I call as a member?\n\n<strong>It is not clear how to respond to calls for clarity as there is no efficient way to ensure everyone understands everything at all times</strong>. People care about issues and questions that come up. Usually when they step into the Edgeryders platform, or any other platform, they have not read the terms of service. Or if they have, they do not always make sure they have understood them. There is no efficient way to ensure everyone understands everything at all times.\n\nAlso there is a problem with the \"<strong>need for clarification</strong>\" <strong>argument</strong>: you can always shoot down something by claiming it is unclear. It can, and is often used as a a powerful stalling mechanism. In the case of Edgeryders there are write-ups all over the place:\"That does not mean people read them, or understand them. So you risk getting into very unproductive discussions. The person doing the communicating needs to be as explicit as possible. Once communication is there, if people don't read it then it cannot be helped\".\n\n<strong>When conversations get stuck.\u00a0</strong>Discussion has an opportunity cost- every minute you spend discussing it is one minute you are not getting something else done. When is it really worth the time and how to tell?<strong>\u00a0Does digging deeper into things/discussions always help? </strong>\"Everyone can have their own interpretation of everything. Sometimes discussions do not solve things/bring solutions, but cause more problems.\"\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Tasks</h3>\n\n<a href=\"/user/6491\">@Adela_Militaru</a>\u00a0has kindly offered to write the invitation for next week's Community Call around a key question that came out of today's call, and post it as an event. <a href=\"/u/nadia\">@Nadia</a>\u00a0has committed to get the invitation out via next week's newsletter and the Edgeryders social media channels.

Following the announcement of this big news, we asked Matthias to give us a bit of background on this initiative. It came up that they are leaving to Kathmandu on April 27th, in search for local changemakers and social innovators, that the project will further bring together. Similarly to an older project, \"Spot the future\", this is an horizon scanning initiative that will bridge between institutional stakeholders (i.e. UNDP) and the local community engaged with social change, doing interesting work all over the place. It is based on warm social contacts, online and on site. Matthias and Natalia will be working on the ground, engaging with little talent-picking trips.\n\n<strong>How do these projects work in engaging the local communities at large?</strong>\n\nWell,for these projects to work you don't need everybody. You just need to find relevant game-changers to connect with.\u00a0The success of this kind of online engagement is not in percentage or population share, it's in the absolute number of people who get involved.\n\n<strong>What can our community do to support this new project?</strong>\n\nFirst of all, make sure we keep our eyes open for Nepali newcomers on the platform, welcome them, engage with them, share ideas, and exchange useful resources or\u00a0connect them with other edgeryders elsewhere.\n\nMeanwhile, it was suggested that the Nepal permanent team may share things that happen offline on the actual platform. E.g. short videos and photos and posts from events. This will make us who are not there feel involved and more engaged in new Nepali additions to the community.\n\n<strong>Other updates from the community.</strong>\u00a0Noemi moved to Bucharest, to be working with the Cultural Institute there. //still off the record - she will update us when the time comes ;)\n\n<strong>Ideas for the making of the Edgeryders cultural team.</strong>\u00a0We have some contacts to do more work in ECOC for other countries and cities. At the moment, we have a good standing\u00a0in the cultural field because Matera European Capital of Culture happened.\n\nDoes it make sense to put investment into this and create a more permanent global team for doing this kind of thing? How to train and edgeskill people?\u00a0Our cultural team would 1) scout for opportunities for paid projects in the cultural field and 2) be ready to \"go\" when paid projects come in.\u00a0There are at least 10-15 opportunities each year.\n\nMaybe some people in the community aspire to drive this for their city and we can help. The solution we propose is\u00a0turning top down decisions and programme building into collaboration and citizen engagement.\n\n<strong>Challenging shared ownership of collaboratively built projects.</strong> Do we believe projects should be kept open? This launched a whole new topic of \"decent practices\" in collaborative project management, that keep the project cost-efficient (time, team, money etc.), avoid diffusion of responsibility and blurred roles, while maintaining transparency and collaborative principles.\n\nMatthias shared the example of Open Ethnographer.\"we experimented how to build projects on rewards and collaboration. We kept it\u00a0very open at beginning of development work. We put tasks on mailing list and people could just \"grab\" tasks, and then commit to doing them. This worked to a degree but it turned out we had a core team of a small group of people, smaller than we had hoped, and it closed the project because larger effort of breaking down work and packaging it into task turned out not to be worth it.\n\n<strong>Another experience brought to the table relied on making sure everyone contributing their time to the project is compensated accordingly (time-bound</strong>). Matthias has tried time tracking in other startups, and it worked well. But it is still to be discussed how and where this approach is appropriate.\n\n<strong>Another approach is to place the focus on the project leader/driver</strong>. In this case, the organizational vehicle acts as a support for them. Leaders will tend to be the people who propose projects.\n\n<strong>Another possibility is to keep group open during task definition phase, and close the group once people have taken on all the tasks</strong>. However, the downside of this is that it doesn't leave the possibility for\u00a0other groups or members to build on it, or spontaneously contribute their ideas online - this has been\u00a0a great way to scout for talent (people show up when interesting projects are happening and contribute their comments, interests...)\n\n<strong>One more decent practice from how Nepal gig has gone so far</strong>: one comment can land you on the team, like in Natalia's case.\u00a0<strong>Meeting and getting to know what everyone is good at, allows you to stay in touch informally with key people who can contribute to new projects</strong>.\n\nThe last thread of discussion is about organizing our next community event -\u00a0building on the great experience of LOTE4 (see\u00a0https://vimeo.com/112143480)\n\n<strong>Who would be fit to assume coordination of this event?</strong>\n\nMaybe\u00a0for people who are new to the community it is hard to get an overview and connect the dots. It would make sense to have someone who is older community member being conference director. At the same time, the enthusiasm of newcomers could be beneficial, since there are many resourceful members who could support the whole process.\n\nAn insight into\u00a0Natalia's experience from being involved in coordinating Lote4 would be helpful. She was asked to share this in a post for the whole community.\n\n<strong>It's time to think about next LOTE!\u00a0</strong>What is most important is for the coordinator to focus on\u00a0building relationships, doing engagement, helping people help you, to give that sort of direction, apart from having the overview of logistics of the event.\u00a0\n\nHow long does it take to \"get it\" and be able to take the lead on organizing/coordinating the work of community members building a LOTE? We'll see, there is no ONE clear-cut answer. People have to resonate with assuming this position, it will be A LOT of work! (e.g reading everyday a little bit, participating in discussions, looking at previous programs and how they were structured...)\n\nThe advantage would be that coordinating team\u00a0get to know community really well and are more exposed to what happens within the community. But... it's not really a part-time thing. So, <strong>who's up for the challenge? </strong>We'll see.\n\n*somewhere down the line the true purpose of the community call arose: Natalia helped Vieri connect with someone in London - life saving! :)*\n\n<em><strong>Tasks:</strong>\u00a0</em>@Noemi kindly offered to prepare next week's call. Others present in the call, as always, are invited to edit this post to complete with any other relevant info. @Natalia was invited to share her experience on contributing to the coordination of LOTE4.\u00a0Community members will need to decide who will take on the coordination of LOTE5 and where it will be organized.\n\n<strong>Community headlines for this week</strong>:\u00a0We need to find the mastermind who will be behind LOTE5. Who's up for the challenge?\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\"><strong>Thursday April 23, 11:00 CEST</strong></h2>\n\n<em><strong>Present during the call:</strong>\u00a0[add @aliases for

Alberto - it's not why are we bad at selling resilience to government, it's \"why is government so blind that it caused this crisis and refuses to take the consequences of the mess it has made seriously.\"\n\nThese debts, they're huge, vast debts, but they were all built up as instruments of private profit - and goverment financial regulators created the system they were created in, and when it started to explode, bought up the debts and made them into public debt, into money owed by ordinary tax payers.\n\n<strong>If they could have conceived of the problem, they would never have created it.</strong>\n\nResilience is hard to sell because goverment is short sighted. But fortunately we don't have to sell it to government, at least not to national government - local government and private citizens are actually the backbone of all meaningful resilience efforts because resilience is almost explicitly something that kicks in when the efforts of Nation State governments don't work. We're here to catch the problems that national goverments either failed to catch or simply outright created.\n\nAs for selling it, the military and the big disaster agencies inside of government are pretty sold on resilience already. The problem is moving outside of the specialized arena of disaster relief professionals and into the wider situation. These two pieces in New Scientist magazine examine what's happening in Greece from a humanitarian, epidemeological perspective, and the word is not good. They're talking about Malaria coming back, and about a lot of older people dying of preventable diseases and suicides.\n\nhttp://pastebin.com/MVUmhgxJ\n\nTo fix that problem is going to take a whole-of-society re-engagement with actually taking care of each-other, our families, our neighbours, ourselves. But getting there means admitting how badly the State as screwed up in its duty of care by adhering to a neoliberal ideology which everybody knew was going to screw the poor, crash, burn and explode in the long run. They just didn't know how short the long run would be.\n\nSo we have to be very careful in that in selling resilience as a concept to national government, we can't let it turn into YOU FOOLS LOOK WHAT YOU HAVE CREATED and yet, in our own minds, we have to know the truth: we need resilience because they crashed the ship into the rocks.\n\nI think that pushing the notion of protecting national life expectancy as a goal of government - protecting people from dying early because of stress, suicide and poor medical care - is a pretty good idea.\n\n<strong>We could make it a prominent national indicator, like GDP used to be. What do you think?</strong>\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-24 12:57:22", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:47.081451", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 488, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [16261], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 858, "user_id": 3680, "topic_id": 825, "post_number": 1, "raw": "All of my studying and experiences encouraged me to learn more about the world we live in, particularly its population, demographic trends, societies, economies, cultures and the environment .With a growing interest in issues such as migration, climate change, environmental degradation and social cohesion, the present is a perfect time to be involved in a subject that literally touches everybody. We also must know and understand the characteristics of the population and problems. Gender Equality is an issue that increasingly attracting attention and I'm glad that it is so, because we have to face with problems in intention to solve. Especially in the Balkans because of the tradition, male dominance and patriarchy dogma, we can`t even speak about gender equality. Violence against women is a common phenomenon, discrimination in employment, obtaining dismissal due to pregnancy, sexual harassment at work, on the street, not to mention the Roma communities, where women have almost no rights, the situation is bad, and even alarming.\n\nWomen are treated as less valuable, challenging their basic human rights. The right to education, freedom of movement, the right to vote, the right to decide about their marriage, not to be forced, mutilated or rejected by family, society if they do not abide by traditional rules and norms, teen marriage, teen pregnancy, violence against a woman, more often situation.\n\nThe violence being perpetrated against girls and women it takes on epidemic proportions.\n\nAnd instead of every day a woman to be given more heed, honored, a pillar of society and the family, it is at the margin, not only neglected but also abused, physically and mentally exhausted,, without the right to fight for themselves ,their \u00a0life, their well-being.\n\nWomen who are the most oppressed are precisely those without education, personal income . How many women and girls were sexually exploited, raped ...\n\nWhat are the primary tasks?\n\n\u00a0To be primarily pledge any form of violence and abuse, to provide education, training. Selection of partners is free will, the right to contraception, the right to health care, the right to equal pay, the right to be employed, not to be discriminated just because it's a woman, it does not get fired when she went on maternity leave, to receive compensation while pregnant, the right to social protection, in health insurance and care.\n\nThe right to engage in politics of his country, to participate in the economy, not only as a worker, but also as an entrepreneur, manager, trustee\n\nTo be more women in science, the arts, that were not created just to take care of home, children, family, that are free to read, write, engage in teachings, scientific research\u2026.\n\nMany seem that women seek the impossible, seek the same thing does not belong to them. Women do not seek a special status, not seeking privileges.\n\nWomen \u00a0demand the respect that every human being deserves, looking for the opportunity to be the best version of yourself, achieve talents, looking for an opportunity to live freely, go towards achieving its objectives without fear that they will be attacked, abuse, put down, ridiculed\u2026 crippled\n\nMany studies have shown the importance of women in large companies and how important it is to have greater participation of women in the labor,\u00a0The whole society has benefits and profit from that, also\u00a0economic empowerment of women can give them the strength and the power to fight for their rights.\u00a0What is I have to emphasis\u00a0totally crazy, to fight for something that is obvious and should be guaranteed.\u00a0But since we live in such a country and such a world, which I will say freely that's gone completely crazy.\n\nThe first thing we have to teach girls, because some things are taught from childhood, that the slap is not love, that no one have right to beat you, there is no reason to be afraid. You have\u00a0to forget that terrible sentence, you're a girl, you you have to let go, you have to listen, \u00a0you must be good,\u00a0obedient\n\nWell, \u00a0you do not have to do anything\n\nBe good and obedient and you'll be good and obedient patients\n\nIf you're a girl, you do not have to do anything that you do not like, house, kids, kitchen, It is not your job by default, \u00a0you can be scientist, pilot, astroanut, everything you want\n\nOf course, a question of love, partners, children, number of children, or abortion, should be your choice, initiation of sex and number of partners is also your thing, \u00a0to love, to be loved, free, jealousy is not proof of love, respect and friendship are very important, you have a right to do what you want when you want and not worry about social norms, because only happy persone have good thoughts and \u00a0works good, Society where women are sitting home and deal with the housework is dead. We need all the strengths and capable\u00a0and smart and successful women, because obviously while men are leding,\u00a0we can not talk about peace and prosperity, we should agree to disagree, to respect and appreciate each to give\u00a0positive example because children learn from their parents, scattered on the model, so change must start from family, parents, environment, kindergartens, schools ... this is serious story , a wide and large, but the success is guaranteed if we work together, jointly, it is not enough to have a law that sanctioned violence, because in every segment of society and at every step of women suffer some form of discrimination, some form of abuse, violence, really suffer if they are young and pretty, and if they are ugly and old, have always been the subject of ridicule, gossip, and never good enough and ther is \u00a0always something wrong , they have to be perfect to be loved because they are \u00a0upbringing in that manner, it is a huge burden, that burden must be rejected, it's okay to be imperfect it's okay to have a bad day, to smilie\u00a0and \u00a0to be good...\n\nIt is a great theme, and very serious and \u00a0requires indispensable\u00a0large and big steps to make the change, so we\u00a0won't\u00a0any more\u00a0read about dark statistics or to be a part of it,\n\nI forgot about inadequate or not existing\u00a0 health status of women and treating them, how horrible gynecologist acting,\u00a0a large number of cancers that are not detected at time, shame, \u00a0when they\u00a0give birth listen insults and so on...\n\n\u00a0I want you to understant situation in my country, importance of the problem and that action is needed, that will not be easy, but it is something that must do\u00a0because it is not a choice any more it is our obligation.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-31 10:56:08", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 03:26:23.249302", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1185, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 10.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5248, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 5215, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Jochem Casier, a film director and an artist based in Brussels, will join us to show the first material of a documentary that he and his friend recently shot in Colombia.

A group of people who can all more-or-less stand on their own feet are stronger together than alone, but a group in which the average is less-than-survival together will simply tend to drag each-other down. There are simply no \"economies of scale\" in survival groups.\n\nThis is not to say that, for example, tribes are not incredibly resilient. But, like modern Mormons, there are intense social pressures on people to carry their weight - to be prepared, to be resilient, to be skilled, to add something of value to the tribal collective in exchange for their membership of it, to be an asset to your neighbours, not a burden.\n\nWhen drowning the weak children became unacceptable to us, we made a State. I'm (of course) bending the causality here, but I'm also making a point - tribal societies often practiced euthenasia for the old, we are told - Eskimos who'd go off on a final hunting trip which consisted of sitting on an ice flow and drifting out to open sea, or deformed children left out in the snow. This stuff is no joke, and while I'm not an expert in the history (I'm aware these reports may have been biased by Colonial historians) we have to beware our own idealization of a prior state. We remember the benefits, but do not remember the costs.\n\nIn this context, the most vulernable need a State to protect them. A community cannot carry somebody who needs, say, kindey dialasis. A State can carry people with those kinds of medical costs, and so can the Market given a healthy health insurance system, but a community does not have the resources to amortize the costs of the weak.\n\nThere is a *very* real case to be made for the most vulnerable people in Greece to head for countries with a strong Welfare State and good free public health case. <strong>The safety net is necessary, and it's still there in some places. Why not use one's freedom as a European to take advantage of it?</strong>\n\nOn the second point, on scale... I think I've answered that to a degree, too. We need scale to amortize risks. Whether Europe is simply Too Big is a much, much harder question, but small unit societies cannot and do not carry their weakest members - they (often) drop them. If we're to provide a really strong safety net, it may require quite a large political bloc to provide it, and I think that's doubly true when we start talking about environmental protection. Large political blocs can make substantial dents in the global environmental situation by regulation. Smaller blocs know their actions don't have much effect, so there's a strong tendency to say \"well, we're only 1.3m people, what can we do?\" and keep on burning the coal regardless.\n\nI do believe we need massive local political control, but we also need to delegate upwards what we can't do ourselves, and the burdens a small community cannot be expected to carry.\n\nThe Big State has Big Arms. The village does not.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-23 12:55:30", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:39.474644", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 603, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [24499], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17051, "user_id": 13, "topic_id": 1722, "post_number": 12, "raw": "That's my man!\n\n", "created_at": "2012-10-31 18:13:12", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:35.188916", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 6, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [6837], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12100, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 6122, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Shell?</b>\n\nWhat do you mean by that, Petros?\n\n", "created_at": "2013-03-22 11:58:38", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:09.172281", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 12, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 6.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [10484], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1138, "user_id": 211, "topic_id": 1105, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hallo to all,\u00a0\n\nI introduce myself. My name is Federico Bonelli, I am italian buit I live in Amsterdam. I started out as a philosopher of science and remained a philosopher since, but mainly I work my way on the border between \u00a0the arts, science and sustainable culture as a free thinker.\n\nMy actual interest is to practically setup a laboratory for treating performance, sustainability and community development. And this is the core of the project \"trasformatorio\" that together with fellow artists we lounched with a test case this april in Sicily. I believe in situations that include people, expression, technical attention and good design, and that is the spirit of the laboratory we thought of and started.\n\nI am joining this community in the hope of enlarging my network and knowledge, with meeting interesting people that have similar vision about the future and a larger base of competences, sharing ideas and experiences between pairs. I am very interested in collaborating to other projects if is the case and I can learn something in doing it.\n\nI cut and copy here below the introduction to my main project.

Main challenge to the artists is to go \u2018back\u2019 to the basic questions of performative arts in this specific place: \u2018what can we be aware of here and transform into a vital work; a work that shares/communicates a pure reflection on what is present for us here?\u2019 The topic of sustainability, both of natural landscape and cultural life, follows directly and organically on these basic questions. Awareness of the place and local culture is artistic starting point. The \u2018transformations\u2019 that we seek, are meant to enrich the cultural exchange of both the local people and the visiting artists. Artistically \u2018reading\u2018 a place means in our project: taking care of the place.

Mrs. Gilda Farrell is the Head of the Social Cohesion Research and Early Warning Division, Directorate of Democracy at the Council of Europe and she is the number one responsible for having the Council and the European Commission on board. I managed to catch Mrs Farrell\u00a0 in the hallway and ask her a few questions\u00a0 about Edgeryders... \u00a0\n\n<strong>Noemi: Hi Gilda, I'm curious as to why you personally decided to take up this project and why you are so engaged in it?</strong>\n\n<strong>Gilda: </strong>Noemi. There are two main reasons for my interest in this project. Firstly,\u00a0 I view the conventional wisdom on the transition of the young as a mechanical one: they are supposed to finish their studies, after that have a career perspective and eventually become citizens. In my opinion this transition is not smooth and moving from one status to another and through different statuses is much more complex. Educational institutions are neither providing young people with the key to enter the labour market, nor are they nurturing the citizenship exercise. It was the need for me to make explicit for the policy makers the processes of transition and their obstacles, but as well the way young people are looking into the future. How do they want to be part of the society? Nobody is asking them \"what type of society do you want to live in? On which basis do you want to become linked in the community?\". I think this is the aim of our project. The second reason why I was interested is that when you look at the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEET\">NEETS</a> statistics it looks like a black hole. Apparently the young are not doing anything: they don't have a job, but they are not in education or training either. We don't have the parameters to look at these <a href=\"http://www.cottica.net/2011/08/22/how-open-data-will-change-social-research-come-gli-open-data-cambieranno-la-ricerca-sociale/\">statistics</a> and ask ourselves: what are they doing? If we condemn them and say that this is a lost generation I think there is no hope. We need them! And I think they are generous and offer various alternatives of how to become citizens. So I want to offer ourselves the opportunity to build hope by changing our perception of young people! And lastly, there is a personal reason for my involvement. I am a mother. I have a son who is an engineer and I found myself having to encourage and support him when going through tough selective processes to become employed after graduation. Rather than encouraging him, the first experiences destroyed his self-confidence. Employers were requiring abstract leading and cooperation skills while his technical knowledge was not valued.\u00a0 And now that he's eventually succeeded, he told me that he would've wanted, whilst in university, to be trained in managing human relations and in dealing with hierarchical positions and\u00a0communication at the workplace. He had to learn all of these through experience.\n\n<strong>Noemi: Thanks Gilda!</strong>\n\n<strong>Edgeryders in a nutshell:</strong>\n\n<strong>Team members: </strong>Gilda, Alberto, Nadia, Noemi, Alberto MZ, Vinay, Ivan, Carlo\n\n<strong>Network so far: </strong>our members come from Italy, UK , Spain, Sweden, Belgium, Romania, Scotland, Germany, The Netherlands, India, Morocco, Poland, Canada, Greece, Denmark\n\n<strong>Launch: </strong>end of October 2011\n\n<strong>Place:</strong> on-line\n\n<strong>Info</strong>: stay updated on <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int\">http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int</a>\n\n", "created_at": "2011-10-04 15:28:56", "updated_at": "2018-06-03 09:49:30.097956", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 696, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11204, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1426, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Edgeryders participants point to more elevated possibilities</b>\n\nHa ha!

Unfortunately, we have a history of using it as a stalling technique (probably in good faith). It works like this: dialogue is invoked on something (like you here: \"work with us on XYZ!\"). People come onboard and try to make some headway: they craft arguments, research resources, write syntheses. At this point the whole thing is cordially ignored. Of course, whatever problem dialogue was meant to fix is\u00a0<em>not</em>\u00a0fixed, so it comes back up. And again \"hey, let's have a conversation about this!\". The memory of the previous round is not built upon, so we start all over again.\u00a0\n\nCoincidentally, the points you mention (a space conducive to productive discussion and realignment) make two great examples. The case for Edgeryders to be \"messy but open source, so fixable and expandable\" was made <a href=\"/t/build-your-own-home-why-the-user-experience-on-the-edgeryders-website-is-worse-than-on-the-commercial-cloud-and-why-thats-good/2404\">here</a>\u00a0a year ago. Dialogue ensued, and if you read the thread it will be clear that we <i>did</i>\u00a0understand each other. We really talked. But we did not\u00a0<em>agree</em>. In the end, as you know, the decision was that the UX was simply not good enough for the uM crowd, and everybody moved over to Facebook/GoogleGroups/Trello etc. What you achieved was this:\n\n<em>\"some of the most valuable members of the ER community don't post or read very often/ever [...]\u00a0when it comes to the moment when they're needed, our workflow seems to bring them in at the right time.\" [<a href=\"/t/build-your-own-home-why-the-user-experience-on-the-edgeryders-website-is-worse-than-on-the-commercial-cloud-and-why-thats-good/2404/5\">source</a>].\u00a0</em>\n\nWhat you lost is that it's hard for anybody outside the Very Inner Circle to know where stuff is.\u00a0<em>I</em>\u00a0have no idea where stuff is, and I am supposed to be a founding member of unMonastery LBG! Or maybe I\u00a0<em>was</em>, at some point, but then a discussion happened (where?) and the people doing the heavy lifting changed their mind (as is their prerogative, and I am not offended at all). In fact, I don't even know <em>that.</em>\u00a0All I know is that I was asked to join a company in February by a mass email (???) and then, for over three months, I have heard\u00a0<em>nothing:</em>\u00a0not a link to a discussion space, not a rationale for incorporating, not an idea of who would pay for what. Not even a date, or a \"if you have questions contact XY\", or \"we have changed our mind, it's not happening\". From where I stand (which is supposedly the inside of it), this process is completely opaque. So you pay a very high price in terms of legibility: I hope the benefit was worth it. Me, I prefer the other way, the one ER is organized, as flawed as it is. A year ago we agreed to disagree, the unMonastery built its own comms, and everyone is happy. What do we stand to gain by rediscussing that?\n\nFacilitated realignment was tried in March/April 2015. <a href=\"/t/the-confessional/596\">It went\u00a0really badly</a>, and sank in a debate on who should design the process (which reminds me - I owe the generous people who engaged an apology). Same thing: not much of a case for going back to it that I can see.\n\nSo, as far as I am concerned, we already played the dialogue card on both these issues. If we are still not happy, it means we have not solved our problems that way, and we will need to think of some other way. Does this sound reasonable?\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-27 18:15:25", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:09.577021", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 699, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [23328], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2414, "user_id": 1680, "topic_id": 2381, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Sooo, we talked about Portugal.

When people are free? Cosyncronising with other events/happenings?\n\nOh, who am I? I am Peter, and a big part of my focus for the near future will be on helping Dorotea organise this. (Here's my data: http://bwcd.vdcn.org/doku.php/people:peter http://bwcd.vdcn.org/doku.php/discussion:images) .\n\nI may well have gone to the last LOTE, if I had known about it. I always want to double things. So if you say you want 200 people, I say 'let's shoot for 400!' (not at!). Is 400 too many? I'm confident we can hit this number. And not just any old people, excellent people. (but unexcellent people won't be excluded, of course (Or will they?)). And given 200+ people, I think plenty of space for camping would be a big plus. It could work if people are hosted in many different places, couchsurfer style, and attending meetings in one central location. But I'm thinking it would be cool for everyone to be sleeping in the same place, and have the meetings in giant tents or something. Then there is no issue with people needing to leave cos they have to catch public transport back to their hosts, or whatever. The meetings can go on all night! Thoughts?\n\n((And then a wild idea comes to mind: What if we contrive some way to own the land, then we never have to leave the unDojo. It's not a priority to go this far, just... what if? Is anyone inspired by the thought? You know what? I might buy the land for the tent village, but not tell anyone. Then after a cool first week, 70% of the people will say 'hey, i wish we could stay for a few more days (cos our subgroup still hasn't finished this cool project we're working on)\" and I'll be like \"You can. No problem. I know the guy that owns this land and he's pretty chill\". Then soon enough people will forget about asking if they have to leave, and they'll lose track of time, and magical things will be produced unMon sty-lee (pigs). . . . . . . . . . . Do I live in an insane castle in the sky? Yes, but it's real! History will be the judge. If you grok with this idea, dare to dream with me. If you don't grok, no worries, Dorotea will give you a cool LOTE no matter what. (and I will still help her)))\n\n", "created_at": "2014-01-28 22:52:51", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:12.977358", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 469, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 814, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 781, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://nadiaelimam.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/screen-shot-2013-02-11-at-11-29-38-am.png\">\n\nAll over the world people are building a new world together. Amazing projects demonstrate hope for the future and visions of the world which is possible when we work together.

Please tell us about the amazing things you and your friends are doing, or have visited, so that we can showcase the cultural innovation which is shaping a new way of making our way in the world. We are interested in new kinds of employment, social enterprises and other projects which embody new values, cultural centres, galleries, projects and teams. If it's a place that people can visit, so much the better - take a tour in your own city or while you are travelling, and see some of the New Planet.\n\n<strong>Where does this all go?</strong>\n\n1) An\u00a0anthology\u00a0on youth, the labour market in the Baltic Sea Region to be published by Edgeryders and <a href=\"http://en.globalutmaning.se/?p=3088\">Global Challenge</a>.

The workshop brings together labour market and democracy researchers, people in the academia and other European experts, alongside<strong>\u00a0YOU</strong>. The workshop discussions will be heavily based on the online\u00a0conversation around this initiative (<strong>#baltedge</strong>). A limited number of selected contributors will be invited to the workshop, with their travel expenses covered by Global Challenge.

In Bucharest, in Cluj where I\u2019m from and in other towns as well about 100-300 protesters meet every evening and walk peacefully across town to make their voices heard. In addition to opposing current political leadership and its decisions, they also speak against the opposition and dismiss the entire political class labeling them \u201cthiefs\u201d, \u201ccorrupt capitalists\u201d and many more. Other claims are: for the government not to sign with Gabriel Corporations to begin cyanide-based exploitations in our very own Transylvanian-gold-rich Rosia Montana, Romania going back to being a monarchy, empowering youth instead of pushing them to look abroad and so on. </em>\n\n<em>One of the prominent local activists, musician and journalist says \u201cthe protests will not end. We are a different kind of generation\u201d. What generation could that be, I wonder? </em><em>I asked one of my friends, a Moldovan and soon-to-be Romanian citizen who is an active protester, why he is protesting and what does it mean standing in the streets. Here is what he told me in this rather informal chat:</em>\n\n<em>So Andrei, do you usually participate in protests or rallies?\u00a0</em>\n\nAndrei: In Cluj I\u2019ve joined protests against the new education law. Unfortunately there have been sort of few people attending, out of thousands of students about 200 people. I regularly joined protests in the Moldovan Republic in 2009 and now these.\n\n<em>Do you know why these people are here today?</em>\n\nA: I guess. In fact they are protesting for a number of reasons, starting with getting rid of Basescu <em>[Romania\u2019s president]</em>, the government, Rosia Montana, education law, legalizing marijuana.. now they\u2019ve picked on the university environment and want to dismiss Marga <em>[Andrei Marga is rector of the largest university in Romania]</em> and many others.\n\n<em>And for which of these causes are you here?</em>\n\nA: For none really. I\u2019m here because I need to talk about personal frustrations such as living in a hostile citizen \u2013institutional environment and find like-minded people, to get ourselves organized in the future. To create a space for socialization, discussions and debates.\n\nI also participate because I understand, from what I\u2019ve read, that Romania is going through a hard time and I come here to help social capital grow and make for a non-violent transition towards a new system of government or state organization, to help reform social democracy and what concerns the people, the general population.\n\n<em>Do you think voting could solve some of the issues? </em>\n\nA: No, I don\u2019t think so. But I do sign petitions on the internet and offline as well. Today for example I signed a petition against PIPA and SOPA, but they wouldn\u2019t accept it because I\u2019m not in America.. One would need an American zip code for it to be valid..\n\n<em>Andrei, are you a professional activist? </em>\n\nA: It depends, I think it\u2019s good to be generally active and get involved, but without losing a personal viewpoint and vision. But no, I\u2019m no professional activist because it wouldn\u2019t bring me any satisfaction. Maybe there are persons who need to be in the spotlight and make their voices heard irrespective of issue.\n\n<em>How long do you think these meetings will last? What result could they have?</em>\n\nA: You know, It really depends on the outcome of the protests on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Principalities\">Jan 24th</a>, because the date has a strong historical value for a lot of Romanians. I think that there is a feeling in the crowds that if the situation won't change after this, their cause might be lost. I certainly hope that will not be the case and the desire for social change should not reduce itself just to a single date in the calendar, and instead be perpetual.\n\nThe results one could hope for should not entail just a moderate type reshuffling of the government and leadership positions. Instead, my hopes are that the outcomes of the current protests will not settle for elusive public discourse of the political elite and for empty promises of change. A type of change if it is commonly desired should, in my opinion, be the complete redefinition of the current system of social and political organization. Unfortunately, the numbers, scope and vision of the Romanian protesters are too small, vague, unorganized and divided in order to constitute a viable prospect for positive change.\n\n<em>Given that you are not yet a Romanian citizen, to what extent are you affected by Romanian politics? why are you protesting?</em>\n\nA: Because whatever will happen will affect me as well, indirectly, as a resident in this country.\n\n<em>Considering the future, do you intend to stay and live in Romania?</em>\n\n<div>A: No. Because I don\u2019t think I found here the right space for my professional development and a good environment for my lifestyle. I want to leave because I will have to get a job. My specialization in international development makes it impossible to find a job here, Romania doesn\u2019t offer many opportunities for getting hired.\n\n</div>----\n\n<em>In the photo there are Andrei and his friend Elena.

Let's see.\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>You can never neatly map the world with ontologies. All ontologies are unstable and incomplete, and run into the platypus problem.\u00a0I highly recommend reading <a href=\"http://www.shirky.com/writings/ontology_overrated.html?goback=.gde_1838701_member_179729766\">Shirky's forceful argument</a> \u2013 it certainly changed my way of thinking. In terms of our own experience, what was the unMonastery \u00a0group about? Saint Benedict? Work? Matera 2019? Rituals? <em>Individual threads</em> were about all these things, and others. <em>But the unMonastery group was really about\u00a0unMonastery</em>. A lot of what \"unMonastery\" was encoded a social relationship linking unMonasterians, not anything related to knowledge mapping. This is fundamental. Every new project will be about itself. We will keep inventing words (The Reef, OpenVillage...), and having to go back and change our ontology around.</li>\n\n<li>You should not point the user to dead zones. Suppose the following user story: Alice arrives on Edgeryders and is interested in this OpenVillage thing. The site seems to be about\u00a0Agriculture and Food,\u00a0Accommodation and protection,\u00a0Environment and nature etc. Alice thinks this Accommodation stuff seems interesting so she clicks. She promptly finds out that the last update around accommodation was two years ago. She replies to Bob's two-year-old topic. Bob, meanwhile, has drifted away from Edgeryders and does not reply. Alice is having a terrible user experience! We should try to steer her to the inhabited part of Edgeryders: the flagship project groups.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nSo (asks Nadia) what, in my proposal,\u00a0is different from what we have now? This:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>We use tags (not categories) as a best effort practice, knowing they are patchy and imperfect but still improve searchability.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>We use project names as tags,\u00a0(as suggested by Matthias above). Any topic created within a project is tagged with the project's name.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nSo, how would this work in practice? For example, now OpenCare is a flagship project. You go to discourse.edgeryders, you see the category right there. You are encouraged to join. People will be waiting to engage. All good. Content is tagged, of course. In\u00a02018, we end the project, remove the OpenCare\u00a0category (or demote it,\u00a0so that it does not show up, or clearly flag it as an archived project). But all the topics are still there, still tagged. For example, <a href=\"/t/insulin-diabetes-situation-in-belgium-team-meeting-notes-26-04-2017/6245\">this\u00a0topic</a> about open insulin will be tagged open source, insulin, diabetes, Belgium. But\u00a0<em>also</em>\u00a0OpenInsulin, and possibly OpenCare.\u00a0\n\nSuppose also in 2018 we get a contract to do work around the smart open ecovillages in Europe (not impossible). We create a new category called \"Smart Open Ecovillages\"; we create a list of tags that are related to the new project and we ask Discourse to bring in all the topics that are tagged with one or more of\u00a0the tags. This has an added advantage: we instantly populate our new project with content.\u00a0\n\nResult:\u00a0\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>categories are unstable and follow activities.</li>\n\n<li>tags are stable</li>\n\n<li>projects are also encoded into tags.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nTechnical question: can the DB record tag authors?\n\n", "created_at": "2017-06-17 21:52:50", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:41.567612", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 602, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 10.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [17070], "is_liked_by": [5, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4405, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 4372, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/4/4d035a4d1676223a4596a2a564ce8f15f4e267ef.JPG\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\nA week ago, me and Matthias went for a day-long trip to Dhading district with a small mission. It's been a great lesson for us to see how the country looks like from outside-of-the-capital perspective. Kathmandu gives some taste of Nepal, with tiny mandirs located on each corner, where people worship the gods and godesses of their preference, with colorful flags decorating houses and streets, and plenty of small fast food places, where you can get national delights, such as momos or typical Nepali lunch set with dal, pickles, yoghurt and rice. You start getting used to people being extremely warm and open towards each other, saluting passers by and slowly diving into the complex social tissues of this nation, involving religious diversity, ethnic richness, 123 languages and countless dialects spoken around you, and cast/subcast relations.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5cac5d98be976fb6b670c0be47de74891f273f52.JPG\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\nKathmandu, inhabited most probably by 2.5 million people (although the right number seems to be impossible to obtain, so far each person gives a slightly different idea about the size of the city and it varies from 2 to 5 million citizens), is just a small portion of 28 million nation, of which 80% live in the villages. We had a chance to see a little bit of that reality during the trip 110 km inside the rural areas of the middle strip (hilly part), indeed quite evenly populated. The car passed by a whole range of small villages situated along the roads, consisting of small houses, quite often interestingly attached to the slope on which the road sits - so that the ground level cannot be seen from the street perspective, but once you take the steep stairs down, you end up on the riverside, in a bedroom, where the whole family of three, four, five, sleeps in the same room. The road-level of the houses is mostly devoted to small shops and restaurants with clay hearth fired with wood, on which milk tea is constantly boiling, and once you stop to have lunch there, they use it to cook their delicious, fresh food in a set of metal pots. We were fed by a lovely family who went down to bring some fresh pumpkin leaves which they fried in curry for us, and everything they prepared was just pure nature and savory.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9f977f544980a3de515c09081ab21372e2dd295f.JPG\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/c/ca56aa4d1835dba000f162c6ab50b0c004b6938c.JPG\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\nAfter we passed different landscapes, that varied from river bed surrounded by terraces on which crops grow, banana and mango trees, springs coming out of the rocks, to higher areas covered with forests, we finally went entered Dhading, one of the cities in Nepal, and headed off-road for 18 kilometers uphill. There the landscape changed fast into red soil and silver stones, big coniferous trees where little boys pastured goats. The bumpy road to <a href=\"http://world-maps.pro/yandex/Kumai_Jyamrung_map\">Jyamrung</a> took forever and was a great test to our outstanding Nepali driver - but the view from the top of the mountain paid off with a vengeance.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/0/06425dfb0a43089d1a7408151c60cd11d3a05f04.JPG\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\nKumai Jyamrung is a picturesque little settlement of red houses dispersed along the hill. You get the sense of how most of the Nepali lives at the moment - Matthias was pretty impressed by the fact that people here don't use money on a daily basis, and as it is so difficult to reach them, in a way they practice sort of an organic anarchy out there. These extremely remote and distant from the rest of the world places are highly self-contained. All they eat grows on the hills around, the wood they need for fireplaces they find in the forests around, their demand for electricity seems to be reduced to one light bulb per house and probably a socket, and one radio per community, to which they all listen together in their free time. Kids play around, bring us fruits they picked up from the trees and try out their English with us. Women cook and chat in the shadow. Few men we had a chance to see are either too young or too old to migrate. These villages are to a high-extent run by women, whose husbands and adults sons left the country to find jobs in the Middle East or elsewhere.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/69537a178d00923c3c738f3db13b1e8779e2e029.JPG\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\nJyamrung was probably particularly lucky among other villages in Dhading - most of the houses were still standing. These lovely buildings, made of materials available around - red rocks, clay and wood - are all across the country constructed by families, in a traditional way, but without following any architectural guidance. No wonder - even in Kathmandu people build their houses without careful supervision and neglecting rules approved in 1994, after another disastrous earthquake. As a result, we pass by houses which walls are cracked or crumbled, and where people do not want to enter again. Ironically, the habit here is to store all the food upstairs, on a wooden floor - nobody dares to go there now to take the supplies down.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b50e23cd5b52807eb9d4fb08b3b99a8299b5767e.JPG\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\nDespite the problems, life in the village seemed to go on as usual - on its own, slow pace, quite typical for such remote places. We talked with the people, handed out what we brought and headed back to dusty, crowded Kathmandu, not without a small regret that we can't just stay out there for a little longer and disconnect from the world for a little while.\n\nLater this week, we hosted first Edgeryders informal meeting in our garden - around 20 people showed up and chatted about politics, geeky stuff, travels and, surprise, earthquake. In a city where life ends with the sunset, it seems that these meetings might be one of the rare occasions to replicate the social night life of Europe - and I'm looking forward to the next ones.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-10 14:47:59", "updated_at": "2017-08-29 08:01:35.983993", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1108, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 40.4, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 5, 4, 3, 2551], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7353, "user_id": 105, "topic_id": 1141, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>servers?</b>\n\nwhat server infrastructure do you hava available? to setup BigBlueButton I would need a dedicated virtual machine with min 2GB of RAM and decent bandwidth!\n\n", "created_at": "2013-06-08 07:47:28", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:43.143864", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 30, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17223, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3419, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Here's what is happening!</b>\n\nHello Joshua, here's what is happening.\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>We are having a <a href=\"/welcome-to-lote4\">conference</a> in Italy in October.</li>\n\n<li>Tickets are not for sale, they can only be paid <a href=\"/t/register-to-lote4/3398\">by collaborating</a>.

I'd had enough of being a stranger to the radical civic/ social/ ecological/ tech scene in Romania, and only working abroad.\u00a0I even made a 6 month investment and moved to Bucharest announcing <a href=\"/en/spot-the-future-bucharest\">Futurespotters</a> as a pilot, which was basically a local version of Edgeryders making use of our digital infrastructure\u00a0without too much info overload for new members.\u00a0\n\nMore than pitching a lively, global network and peer connections across the globe as perk for Bucharesters to join,\u00a0I hoped to first bring a taste of <strong>open collaboration</strong>\u00a0as an effective, cheap way to learn from people and projects across town bubbles (yep, tribe-like behaviours very much present:\u00a0\"the tech innovators\", \"the greens\", \"the independent\u00a0cultural\u00a0producers\" etc). I marched on collaboration and not the idea of a global support network because global seems sometime distant for busy people on the ground, I'd noticed that while working in Georgia, Armenia, and from reading peers in Nepal. Admittedly, it also\u00a0takes more work, time and skill to forge real connections than I had.\n\nSo collaboration is something everyone says they want. I found, while in Bucharest, that few tried\u00a0to do it outside their usual ways. Doing grassroots work is hard, activists and movement builders are crazy busy indeed, but still, it wasn't just that.\u00a0In a conversation with one of the techies in the group, I was told their group perceived me as too much of an intrusive outsider to trust me and my invitation to join an online community. Fair enough.\u00a0\n\nFast forward one year later.\u00a0Out of Futurespotters, we are now running an OSCEDays event in Sibiu (central Transylvania) in\u00a0sync with a global community: with @SamMuirhead @Irina_Breniuc @Iulian_Ifrim and others in Berlin, Amsterdam, Cluj, Sibiu, Bucharest, Brasov. It's a result, albeit\u00a0small one, of teaching ourselves Internet collaboration, as none of us are in the same town.\u00a0For one day we managed to gather <strong>designers, makers, entrepreneurs who are working or living by circular economy values, but need more to make their work sustainable. </strong>One of the event challenge is figuring out <strong>how\u00a0to close the loop in a product lifecycle</strong>. My hunch is that the challenges they face\u00a0have to do with literally everything in the way\u00a0an initiative is designed and not just with one of the cycles - from ability to find a team sharing the values, to costs of sourcing organic materials, to even purchasing some types of waste, and regulations!\u00a0Irina talked about challenges in the <a href=\"/t/dealing-with-an-upcyling-business/4616\">upcycling field</a>\u00a0here, so you get the rough picture.\n\nOther burning questions participants have:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>What can the circular economy, if anything, borrow from principles of social economy? (the latter being just a little more advanced in practice)</li>\n\n<li>How can small upcycling businesses scale up in order to have a significant impact?</li>\n\n<li>How circular economy affects the integration between rural and urban areas?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/0/0db935c63cce905cad2f78ba9e4f78ab098f59d6.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\">\n\n<em>Medieval Sibiu, a city of approx 150\u00a0000 people.\u00a0Photo credit:\u00a0<a data-rapid_p=\"36\" data-track=\"attributionNameClick\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/4trappor/\" title=\"Go to Mats \u00d6nnestam's photostream\">Mats \u00d6nnestam</a>\u00a0on flickr.com</em>\n\nAs you can see, it's a lot to cover and we may not pass the level of deeply interesting discussions. Not this first edition of OSCEDays.\n\nWhat I'm in for is inserting more\u00a0openness and sharing in a group that is now very dispersed and may be lacking the tools to do so. The fact that it's already aligned in their edgy endeavors and way ahead business-as-usual is a good base to start from. I will also make a case for online coordination platforms\u00a0as a community\u00a0asset. The planning work we are doing for a few months now is a testimony to that: still relatively cheap -\u00a0costs nothing but our energy\u00a0and some\u00a0skyping hours - and mostly, it's a LOT of fun.\n\nSo,\u00a0join us in Sibiu or tweet \\#OSCEDays \\#Romania\u00a0?!

It'll take a while (and a more German philosopher \u00a0-that is, structured-\u00a0mindset than mine) to reach that point, but the enormous explosion of new ideas that will grow up from there will be invaluable.\n\nAlthough, as one trained in the field of languages and literature, I'm not privy to the secrets of complex systems (I wish I'd taken Math as major, but then I'd probably be somewhere totally different), probably chaos theory could help a lot in organizing the *ahem* chaos of the current times.\n\nThe future has many diverse paths we can follow, and I'm convinced we will follow them all simultaneously. Your experience, and I hope my own, will make it true.\n\nAgain, thank you so much for your insight.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-07 18:23:42", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:04.761295", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 209, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33110, "user_id": 3310, "topic_id": 6059, "post_number": 55, "raw": "<b>Emerging digital spaces of possibilities..</b>\n\nDear @Ezio_Manzini\n\ni agree with 2+1 working hypothesis. The role of digital technologies in the project, the metaphor (?) of space for digital and open networking (here the commons issue is of concern too), but mostly \"(spaces of) possibilities\" (i find be a winning concept)\u00a0 deal with infrastructuring (but i would say \"materializing\" as well) advocacies and practices (like discourses and narrations) other from those belonging to healthcare and social welfare systems. It's a matter of giving voice and materializing experiences and relations of people that have an opportunity (a possibility) to be part of the big OP3NCARE narration. It is important to stay focus on the <a href=\"https://reset.revues.org/861\">call</a>, like for instance keeping aware that \"the ambition of this issue of RESET is precisely to question how digital technologies, inserted in different contexts, produce new forms of political mobilization and organization, or stabilize old ones, while conveying multiple values \u200b\u200band principles which are, in turn, transforming these technologies.\"\n\nArenas, voices, policies, mobilization are political terms and we could spend them in a smart way if we consider how the process of infrastructuring consist of embedding politics, scripts and users in the digital technologies. The fact that it is a project funded by the European Commission is already a good answer, i think.\n\nI could work more on the theoretical background. I'm checking if the co-production idiom (<a href=\"http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic251437.files/Fall%202007%20papers/Jasanoff_papers/Jasanoff_States_of_Knowledge_Ch2.pdf\">see page 13 and following</a>) -about the intimacy between what we know and the technology we use- might fit in describing how and why certain aspects emerge in the development of the narration of OP3NCARE and how technology, ethnographical methodologies and stories are tightly interwined (this at the light of the hipothesis 2+1). Digital possibilities need a reflexive approach, already well understood and daily practiced by the OP3NCARE community in terms of openness.\u00a0\n\nI find interesting that is still not so easy to detect and describe in short what is all about. The heterogeneity and complexity are happening at many levels and this makes for us a further challenge, as we must try to share same ontologies possibly with same meanings, reach out agreements and co-produce connections among facts, theories and data.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-01-30 19:57:13", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:01.710567", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 410, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 907, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 874, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<h3><span><strong>Building the Edgeryders transition handbook</strong></span></h3>\n\n<img style=\"margin: 5px;\" src=\"https://d2q0qd5iz04n9u.cloudfront.net/_ssl/proxy.php/http/gallery.mailchimp.com/2426561089e1f5ab32da252cd/images/edger3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"269\" height=\"202\" align=\"right\">\n\nWe want to collaboratively build a document to help make sense of transition as experienced by Edgeryders. In a clear and concise way we would like to crystallise common challenges and resources we draw from in attempting to address them. Which approaches seem promising? Which risks are carried by whom in realising them? Once we have identified them,<strong> the next step</strong> is thinking about how we act on lessons learned from those initiatives if we are to address challenges tied to transition for the Edgeryders community as a whole? How about for much larger numbers of people? The aim of the document is to pool our knowledge and collective intelligence as a community to figure out things together that are difficult if not impossible to do as an individual. We're thinking working on it from <a href=\"http://pad.telecomix.org/pelgutus\" target=\"_blank\">something like this</a>, what do you think?

But in practice, when we organize an event we might want to pay someone to organise it in full (ex: one of the OpenCare Fellows).\u00a0</em>\n\n<em>Under what circumstances can we contract them and what is needed?</em>\n\nLuce:\n\n<em>Staff costs is a budget category in order to pay the time the ER team is going to spend on every WP during the project.\n\nTo give you an example:\n\n\u00a0</em>\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\n<colgroup>\n\n<col width=\"44\">\n\n<col width=\"399\">\n\n<col width=\"239\">\n\n</colgroup>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td><em>0.2.1</em></td>\n\n<td><em>Community activation (social media etc.)</em></td>\n\n<td><em>Nadia</em></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td><em>0.2.2</em></td>\n\n<td><em>Onboarding offline workshops: faciilitation</em></td>\n\n<td><em>Nadia</em></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n<em>The budget Edgeryders prepared before the project submission detailed participation for every team member.\u00a0\n\nIt aimed to evaluate ER needs to obtain sufficient funds for the project's implementation: by foreseeing the person-month distribution among all the participants on the Edgeryders' side and ER's other expenses. In other terms, the task repartition among ER team is an indication. If, for example, you take care of the community activation instead of Nadia, it is ok.\n\nHowever, ER has to keep up with implementing in due time and action the WP and tasks among each WP, such as decribed in the Annex 1 of the GA.\u00a0\n\nFor the use of budget:\n\n1. If ER doesn't plan to use the staff costs to directly pay your salary, ER may further use this budget to pay a service for workshop facilitation,\u00a0<b>provided that ER is able to prove that the time you spent working on the activity matches what is planned in the budget</b>.<b>\u00a0For reports (and even after the project in case of audits), ER has to prove it by showing the time sheets you filled and signed, your work contract(s) and the company books.</b>\n\n<b>Before doing so, it is most important for ER and for the University of Bordeaux as a coordinator to make sure your type of contracts enable ER to do it.</b>\n\n<b>If this is something ER wishes to do, you must let us know first.</b>\n\n2. ER can also recruit some more people to work during the project as supplementary team members, provided that ER will identify for which WP he/she will work (during reports, in the work contracts and time sheets), pay this person according to the UK national law and their usual practices as for recruitement and salary, and redistribute the staff costs budget to include his/her activity.\n\n3. ER can buy services from a company or from a freelance entrepreneur to help dealing with the activities you mentioned below (blogging, documentation).\n\nAn external service would be charged under the direct costs for other goods and services budget category if it matches one of this sub-categories.\u00a0\n\n4.

What we are dealing with here requires more than one facilitator and a significant amount of time: exactly like any arbitration process does. </span></span><span>I would describe what I am proposing in detail as long as I get your consent and agreement to take it seriously and contribute time. </span>\n\n<span><span>What we need here is a long and open conversation - where everyone concerned and involved should be able to be heard, and which doesn\u2019t escalate into an ugly flamewar, however eloquently is it written.</span></span>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<span>Time scarcity is one of the popular excuses not to deal with conflictual situations carefully. And the most painfully sad thing about it that our illusion of time scarcity comes exactly from the inefficiency of our collaborative work, that we also can\u2019t afford to admit.</span>\n\n<span>This issue deserves time - because it is about saving the only thing which matters the ability to resolve conflicts in a way that we can continue working together, not just dump one network and move on to another. </span>\n\n<span><span>We should aim at restored ability to work in parallel and to benefit from each other networks, respect to each others integrity and sovereignty - restored health of the network, because right in this moment it is not healthy. All of it might require a serious restructuring.</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>Conflict prevention and resolution is probably the most urgent and the only thing we need to spend out time on both levels: being able to produce meaningful work as well as remain a mentally stable individual. Nadia mentioned that Edgeryders is a massive experiment. Please, be aware of the fact, that we are dealing with a very serious things - culture of social structures. Specially when the line between life and work is almost non existent. Whether our lives as individuals are hell or meaningful largely depends on how social structures we are a part of function. Please, make sure this experiment, doesn\u2019t result in too many casualties. </span>\n\n<span>Established organisations have courts and arbitration, they can afford justice. We can\u2019t. And a sad fact is - most of the time we think that justice and arbitration is a waste of time. We deal with it emotionally, in a primitive way \u201cOk, I forgive you, lets have a beer, but will never work with you again\u201d and the only valuable asset we have - our networks - gets eroded. </span>\n\n<span>Thats why we will never build anything which is really \u00a0game changing, we will just eat each other alive. And this is very sad. Old school institutions will, and what is meant to be a networked organisation - wont. It will just turn into an ugly midget version of an istitution - as evil as a big one, but less efficient.</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>If you look at this particular situation - lets call it unMonastery IP issue - the reason why this thread even happened is not even the fact that we don\u2019t believe in contracts, and think \u201cit will be fine\u201d. Look at it from structural perspective - these conflicts happen because of the position we are in in relation to those whom we have to ask for little money to work on what we want to work with. \u00a0We blame rigid old school institutions for our \u201cburnouts\u201d - the truth is the structure we are representing which causes so called burnouts. </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>I have been always been an outsider but my experience at the unMonastery and at Edgeryders makes me suitable for the role of a facilitator. I am also pathologically intolerant to hypocrisy, and seeing another good initiative I was once a part of eating each other alive sugarcoating it with \u201cOk, we fight, but we\u2019re all big happy family\u201d will be very painful. Please, remember that I am not a hippie, and in this case look at structures rather than at individuals. Let me know if you up for taking this issue seriously. Facilitation will only work if everyone is equally interested in honestly solving the problem, and people part to the conflict will put time to communicate their position in a structure way. And no, 30min hangout with low bandwidth and background noise - wont help. It might help to solve emotional level problems, similar to having a drink - but on the system level everything will remain the same. However, if you choose solving this problem behind closed doors in some way, I wont argue against it.

We have also made sure that al courses and degrees are reviewed and updated on a regular basis so that it reflects the latest and up to date changes in their respective fields. One of the biggest benefit of pursuing the degrees and courses with us is that we employ highly qualified and professional teaching staff and faculty. All our faculty members have vast experience in the practical fields of education and are experienced enough to understand the nature of each student and help them to realize their educational goals.\n\nNot only does we provide on campus classes to students. We also a dedicated online and distance learning program on offer. This program is designed for those who wish to pursue their degrees with us but cannot attend our classes or campuses for different reasons. Through our online and distance learning program, they can enroll in these courses and have the benefit of getting the same quality of education that we provide to students who attend our campuses. The studies are conducted through correspondence and students can study at a time of their own convenience. Paramount California University ranking with regards to its online courses is highly respected and getting better by the time.\n\nWe realize the fact that our university is a learning ground for students and people from several different nationalities, casts, cultures and ethnicities. It is very important to provide and maintain such an environment where they can blend and mix together and achieve the same goal of getting the best education possible. We respect the value and tradition of all our students and strive to provide them with an environment where they feel free to showcase their skills and talents. We also learn a lot from these students and their cultures. Paramount California University ranking has been boosted because of the fact that it is a preferred learning provider for students from all across the globe.\n\nOur institution also focuses on the fact that students need to concentrate on their co-curricular activities along with their studies. We encourage our students to take an active part in activities other than their studies. This helps them to divert their attention from studies and focus on another side of their learning which is to learn how to keep their body fit and how to showcase their skills in other activities. It also teaches them to learn the sportsman spirit of the game along with having a good team spirit and respecting the rules of the game.\n\nThere are a lot of great things about our students and graduates that make them a preferred choice of employers once they enter the practical fields of life. Employers realize the fact that along with being highly qualified, our students are well groomed, well-mannered and are extremely capable of taking the organization forward with their hard work, dedication and vision.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-10-06 18:58:18", "updated_at": "2018-05-24 10:51:19.429547", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 629, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 15.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12996, "user_id": 24, "topic_id": 1514, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>get in touch</b>\n\nHey!\n\nThat conversation is through email.\n\nNo, I am not up for the interview part.\n\nLooking forward to meet you\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-19 12:58:19", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:13.652326", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 42, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8055, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 4298, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Sure</b>\n\nNext Thursday looks good, I look forward to it!\n\n", "created_at": "2015-04-14 12:43:22", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:46.754434", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 14, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19576, "user_id": 62, "topic_id": 1477, "post_number": 14, "raw": "<b>I agree!</b>\n\nI agree with you! whe the occupied place is a public one it is i easier to discuss about commons than when it is a private property.\n\nI hope they will find an arrangement....\n\nHowevere, even if tactically they might have done better, it's sad when you read this kind of news...\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-17 11:18:35", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:49.127690", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 63, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [8528], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4091, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 4058, "post_number": 1, "raw": "A while ago the Edgeryders organisation applied to an <a href=\"http://catalyst-fp7.eu/open-call-collaboration/\">open call</a> asking communities to come forward and test some new tools for making sense of large scale conversations.

Specifically, this is the moment when you leave yourself time for reflecting and for finding answers. The notions that form the thought/thinking are not disposed chaotically, they are organized and ordered hierarchically in a systematic manner. Many talk about the pyramid of notions and about judgement. Individuals need examples, we are not designed to understand instinctively. In psychology <em>criticizing</em> actually means <em>judging</em>, whereas <em>encouraging</em> is a synomym for <em>affirming. </em>The game consists of a circle with 2 meters in diameter, it will have precise notions written on it, and people will select a word and sit on it for thinking.

A more current definition of permaculture, which reflects the expansion of focus implicit in Permaculture One, is \"Consciously designed landscapes which mimic the patterns and relationships found in nature, while yielding an abundance of food, fibre and energy for provision of local needs.\"People, their buildings and the ways they organise themselves are central to permaculture. Thus the permaculture vision of permanent (sustainable) agriculture has evolved to one of permanent (sustainable) culture.\"\n\nPermaculture (from the English \"permanent agriculture\", i.e. permanent agriculture and then evolved into permaculture, from permanent culture, i.e. permanent culture) was born as a model of sustainable agriculture developed in Australia, around 1978, by Bill Mollison and David Holmgren.\n\nPermaculture teaches how to design human settlements that mimic natural ecosystems.\n\nDesigning in permaculture means creating productive systems that last over time, that are sustainable, balanced and stable; that is able to self-maintain and renew itself with a low energy input.\n\nWe need to take as an example, as a measure of production, the eco-friendly and environmentally sustainable production methods of nature.\n\nPermaculture is not profit oriented.\n\nThe ethical foundations of permaculture are:\n\n* take care of the earth;\n* take care of people;\n* share resources.\n\nPermaculture is based on the idea that by applying ecological principles and strategies we can restore the balance of those systems that underlie life. It is an integrated practice of conscious and ethical design and conservation of productive ecosystems that results in a sustainable, stable, lasting, balanced and aesthetic environment. Permaculture is a holistic approach to agriculture, which takes into account human activities and needs, trying to reconcile them with those of nature, through the construction of a balance between the natural environment and the anthropized environment. It uses the territory imitating the bonds and relationships that are found in nature in order to have plenty of food, fiber and energy to cover local needs. From the English Permaculture movement, and more precisely from Rob Hopkins, the idea of \u200b\u200bthe transition towns is born.\n\nSee also:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture\n\n----\n\n## :it: **_Italian version_** <a name=\"it\"></a>\n\nLa parola permacultura fu coniata da Bill Mollison e David Holmgren a met\u00e0 degli anni '70 per descrivere un \"sistema integrato e in continua evoluzione di specie vegetali e animali perenni o auto-perpetuanti utili all'uomo\". Una definizione pi\u00f9 attuale di permacultura, che riflette l'espansione del focus implicito in Permaculture One, \u00e8 \"Paesaggi progettati consapevolmente che imitano i modelli e le relazioni che si trovano in natura, mentre producono abbondanza di cibo, fibre ed energia per la fornitura di bisogni locali.\" Le persone, i loro edifici e i modi in cui si organizzano sono centrali per la permacultura. Cos\u00ec la visione della permacultura dell'agricoltura permanente (sostenibile) si \u00e8 evoluta in una cultura permanente (sostenibile)\".\n\nLa permacultura (inizialmente permacoltura, dall' inglese permanent agriculture, cio\u00e8 agricoltura permanente ed evolutasi poi in permacultura, da permanent culture, cio\u00e8 cultura permanente) \u00e8 nata come modello di agricoltura sostenibile sviluppato in Australia, intorno al 1978, da Bill Mollison e David Holmgren.\n\nLa permacultura insegna a progettare insediamenti umani che imitano gli ecosistemi naturali.\n\nProgettare in permacultura significa creare sistemi produttivi che durino nel tempo, che siano sostenibili, equilibrati e stabili; ovvero in grado di automantenersi e rinnovarsi con un basso input di energia.\n\nBisogna prendere come esempio, come misura della produzione, le modalit\u00e0 di produzione eco-compatibli ed eco-sostenibili della natura.\n\nLa permacultura non \u00e8 orientata al profitto.\n\nI fondamenti etici della permacultura sono:\n\n* prendersi cura della terra;\n* prendersi cura della gente;\n* condividere le risorse.\n\nLa permacultura si basa sull'idea che applicando i principi e le strategie ecologiche si pu\u00f2 ripristinare l'equilibrio di quei sistemi che sono alla base della vita. \u00c8 una pratica integrata di progettazione e conservazione consapevole ed etica di ecosistemi produttivi che d\u00e0 come risultato un ambiente sostenibile, stabile, duraturo, equilibrato ed estetico. La permacultura \u00e8 un approccio olistico all'agricoltura, che tiene in considerazione le attivit\u00e0 e i bisogni umani cercando di conciliarli con quelli della natura, attraverso la costruzione di un equilibro fra l'ambiente naturale e l'ambiente antropizzato. Utilizza il territorio imitando i legami e le relazioni che si ritrovano in natura al fine di avere abbondanza di alimenti, fibre ed energia per coprire le esigenze locali. Dal movimento della Permacultura inglese, e pi\u00f9 precisamente da Rob Hopkins, nasce l'idea delle transition towns (citt\u00e0 di transizione).\n\nVedi anche:\n\nhttp://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permacultura", "created_at": "2012-05-17 09:24:37", "updated_at": "2018-07-28 16:32:27.599268", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 790, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3924, "user_id": 2363, "topic_id": 3891, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Islington Mill is a Victorian cotton mill in Salford (Greater Manchester). The building was purchased by Designer Bill Cambell in 2001 after renting a floor of the building as part of a collective. Over a number of years the building continued to be used as live/work and became notorious for parties and gatherings. In 2007 Musician Mark and Artist Maurice Carlin became co-directors (alongside Bill) of Islington Mill Arts Club, the company founded to formalise programmes and manage all public facing events, exhibitions and residencies. Arts Club has overseen the growth of an organic and ever evolving programme and successfully raised 100k investment towards the refurbishment of the ground floor venue and gallery project space in 2010. This year they have been <a href=\"http://www.islingtonmill.com/news.php\">awarded major capital funding</a> from the Arts Council England to realise their long term ambition of developing a 9 room residency and large scale, flexible, working and showing space within the building.\u00a0\n\nIslington Mill is rented as studios to a mix of businesses and artists. Bill is the outright owner and rents the ground floor for peppercorn to the separate not-for profit entity 'Arts Club'. The ground floor includes venue, recording studios, gallery and courtyard. Bill is currently legally responsible and alongside co-director Maurice Carlin, a host to the temporary community who pass through.\u00a0The directors are currently researching new strategies and models of funding, finance and organisation that will enable the renovation and expansion of services and a distribution of asset and responsibility beyond the directors.\n\nWith the current development of additional residency space, via funding applications and pitches, I have become fascinated with the process of articulating values in order to demonstrate worth and formalise the informal stewarding of the organisation. The community includes long terms studio holders alongside short-term b&amp;b guests, residencies, and satellite Islington Mill associates such as myself, reflecting a fluid temporality of communities and individuals moving in and out. Those who are present define the activity- comparable to the strategy of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology\">open space technology</a>. In 2012 the directors attempted run a more \u2018professionalised\u2019 organisation with a conventional staff structure and an open-call selected residency programme. This failed to work for them, hence a return and confidence in the fluid and self-selecting nature of their community.\u00a0\n\nI first encountered Islington Mill in 2007 through their library and quickly became involved in their <a href=\"http://islingtonmillartacademy.blogspot.co.uk/\">peer-led art school</a>. I have programmed projects over the years and am currently working with them on the \\#temporararycustodians R&amp;D platform. This platform combines my interest in both Islington Mill as an asset and art works as assets, subject to a shift in the economy of ownership, towards independence (beyond state and market) and share economy.\u00a0\n\n\\#temporarycustodians, is a term that evokes responsibility, guardianship, and care taking. As a legal function it speaks to 'holding without owning', a feature of the collaborative commons.\u00a0\n\nThe starting point for the project was Maurice's\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.mauricecarlin.com/artworks/installed-works/performance-publishing--regent-trading-estate/\" target=\"_blank\">Performance Publishing: Regents Trading Estate</a>,\u00a0an optimistic proposal for an artwork as distributed share ownership across a community of 'custodians'. The share economy is often framed as an efficient and inevitable future,\u00a0one example being Jeremy Rifkin's\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.thezeromarginalcostsociety.com/pages/The-Book.cfm\" target=\"_blank\">Zero Marginal Cost Society</a>- firmly in a tradition of techno-utopianism. Then there are many\u00a0sceptics, who claim\u00a0\u201cthe sharing economy epitomizes the deployment of technology to intensify inequality, in this case by creating monopolies that aggregate and co-opt the effort and resources of many users, who are pitted against one another within the platforms\u201d (<a href=\"http://thenewinquiry.com/blogs/marginal-utility/sharing-economy-and-self-exploitation/\" target=\"_blank\">Share economy and self exploitation</a>).\n\nTemporary ownership is an aspect of precarity. Does the future hold a two class system of those who own permanent, stable real estate value and those who do not, and operate according to nomadic circulatory? In what way is permanence and sustainability increasingly violent in this context? Can we share and hold property temporarily without being exploited by those with permanent assets? Bill, holds a permanent asset in Islington Mill and is facing the challenge of how Islington Mill might be established beyond his holding it open as a benevolent landlord.\n\nHaving worked with public art collections since 2011, the Victorian top-down philanthropic model of collecting artefacts for posterity, represents the slow moving institutional model in contrast to share economy based on temporal distribution of attention and ownership. The first commission for \\#temporarycustodians is Erica Scourti, <a href=\"http://thephotographersgallery.org.uk/erica-scourti-2\">So Like You</a>. \u00a0The commissions consider the way in which artistic research might define an art collection, as opposed to the artwork necessarily being defined by an outmoded Victorian municipal model or art market. Alongside commissioning artworks I have also been looking at organisational share models for the development side of my work for Islington Mill, mostly in UK but some outside including <a href=\"http://robinhoodcoop.org/\">Robin Hood Co-op</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://v22collection.com/about/\">V22 Collection</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://maydayrooms.org/\">Mayday Rooms</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.ivyhousenunhead.com/\">The Ivy House</a>\u00a0(example of \u2018Asset of Community Value\u2019),\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.andotherstories.org/\">And other stories\u00a0</a>(example of Community Interest Company),\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.ownart.org.uk/art-intelligence/own-art-news/art-to-take-home-picture-lending-with-leeds-art-gallery/\">Picture Lending Library</a>. Most of these are in the context of the culture industry, therefore I'm keen to learn about sharing of assets in other industries through Edgeryders and others. These examples \u00a0above are not ones that I promote without question, but they begin to describe a picture of the current share models in order to ask how we might improve on them in the development of Islington Mill.\n\nOver the past eighteen months Islington Mill have experimented with enabling transparency in their organisational development through projects WERQ and CONSTANT MEETING. As you will see on the <a href=\"file:///C:/Users/lenovo/Documents/Documents/Art/Islington%20Mill/Organisational%20dev/Edgeryders/constantmeeting.org\">Constant Meeting website</a> the physical meetings that turned into more formal programming for the Liverpool Biennial 2014 took priority over the online conversation.\n\nWERQ reimagines ways of both presenting and rethinking organisational development by making the internal processes visible and communicable to those who may visit either Islington Mill physically (and witness / participate in the process via the gallery space) or online. In essence this is a developmental project challenging conventional norms of organisational development. The ethos is to place the people (audience, artist, participant) at the heart of the Mill and allow a window and public interventions onto ongoing conversations which have direct impact on the future process of the Mill. It is a place to experiment and do things, and test if people understand, agree and can help. An open-all-hours drop-in office installation in Islington Mill's gallery space, the plan was for Constant Meeting to form of on and offline meetings and conversations with people able to inspire, nurture, fund and support the future independence of Islington Mill, for example, our tenants could be incorporated as a type of expanded \u2018board\u2019 or committee to support future programming and functions.\n\nWERQ and Constant Meeting form a more challenging, time-consuming and ultimately open way to renegotiate development and are in keeping with the ethos of the organisation. It enabled them to communicate and discuss our mission, vision and values with a direct audience. Placing themselves in the gallery space on the ground floor of the building enabled tenants, stakeholders, partners, future investors, collaborators and the public to join our conversation and contribute to ongoing discussions. Constant Meeting is a longitudinal interactive and action research performance aimed at finding practical answers to the question: how do we stay independent?\u00a0 Ultimately the time consuming nature of these projects meant they were not fully realised.\n\nLinks:\n\n<a href=\"http://issuu.com/islingtonmill/docs/im_capital_document\">Document written for Capital funding bid</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.designingeconomiccultures.net/islington-mill/\">Article including timeline, images and interview with Bill Campbell</a>\n\n\u00a0\n\nfile_fid:3929 -", "created_at": "2014-11-11 19:27:26", "updated_at": "2017-10-02 08:58:57.150480", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1465, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23488, "user_id": 2551, "topic_id": 6136, "post_number": 18, "raw": "<b>Quick drive-by quibble</b>\n\nIf you use \"radial tree\" representation (but even more so in others) you often get horizontal lines with the text overlaying the next node.\n\nPerhaps one you force an offset of zig-zag if for horizontal nodes, to avoid that?\n\nThis is really getting impressive here!

I thought I could do better than all previous economists had done. I wasn't that bad, but of course my ambition was quite unrealistic and I got deeply disappointed. I quit and finally made the choice I should have made ten year earlier: I went to art school and studied graphic design. Unfortunately I graduated exactly when the big economic crisis started, in 2008 and graphic design is a very procyclic field (meaning it is one of the first to go down when crisis time comes) so there was no chance for me on the job market. I had to start my own company if I wanted to do anything creative at all. But I had no experience, no customer, no entrepreneur mentality very poor networking skills (I always try to make real friends rather than exchange favors) and no background in business whatsoever. So I had quite some interesting experience but broke up financially and I had to keep taking side-job after side-job, which was taking time away from my real work and in turn made me more dependent on side-jobs. Managed to do some freelance art teaching but couldn't feel at ease with the task because I felt underqualified in the cultural fields.\n\nI forgot to mention that I won a poetry contest when I was 18, felt that this was too easy (!) and decided to keep poetry as a hobby only. That was probably the worst decision ever.

What can we do to enhance them, so that they can better sustain social production and social relationships? Edgeryders set out to find what issues - economic, social and legal - need to be addressed if we are to build and inhabit a world of commons.\n\n<em>\u201cThe things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those that divide us.\u201d</em> - Donald Williams<em> </em>\n\n<em>\u201cGood stuff itches when not shared.\u201d</em> - Lucas Gonzalez\n\n<em>\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to have good relationships unless you have an economic system that supports them.\u201d</em> - Neal Gorenflo\n\n<strong>Why commons?</strong> Common resources - land, water, food - have long been at the center of societies, and people could use them as they pleased in order to survive and improve their lives. Private property made sense only for the amount of things you could use and defend yourself.\n\nOur commons are being eroded from several directions. Some have been \u201cfenced\u201d and become restricted-access private property. This happens even to commons like oral traditions, science, ideas and education, which don\u2019t decrease but rather increase their usefulness when they are used. Artificial scarcity has been created around knowledge, making it unaffordable for many. Other resources - such as air and water - do deteriorate through excessive use, when we hit their renewability limits (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons\">tragedy of the commons</a>). The Internet - perhaps the largest global common - has come under strain around the issue of what should be the limits to what can be shared and how.\n\nYet the need for a stronger commons is strongly felt. Especially for the younger generations, versed in sharing on the global Internet, the reasons for caring about the commons are self-evident, and there seems to be no limit in sight to what we would want to do with an increased pool of shared resources. Do you want to be free to cooperate - building on each others\u2019 contributions - around science, knowledge and health care? Are you more interested in working with others to feed populations, revitalize spaces and strengthen community ties? Do you want to help to provide shelter to those in need? Do you feel a need for secure spaces for open communication between political representatives and citizens themselves?\n\n<strong>Some answers</strong>. Peer to peer systems are being tested and refined all over the world. Digital content is being placed under <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/\">Creative Commons</a> licenses which allow and even encourage copying and distribution (even commercially in some cases), often provided the author is given due credit. Peer to peer frameworks offer new venues for collaboration (see Wikipedia or Linux as commons, or YouTube as a sharing model), meeting the needs of today and tomorrow in terms of open access and networked communities. In <a href=\"http://www.networkcultures.org/weblog/archives/P2P_essay.pdf\">Michel Bauwen\u2019s view</a>, peer to peer systems are the format of future technological infrastructures and work on the basis of equipotency: everyone can cooperate under no prior rules and under horizontal command and control.\n\nIn the new economic model of sharing, commons thrive. They are not objects of acquisition, but goods to be preserved and enhanced. Social innovations such as food co-ops, farmer markets, bike sharing, couch surfing, or cooperative renewable energy projects are paths to community building. Community gardens reactivate urban green spaces and the idea of neighborliness. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/dec/07/occupy-our-homes-families-foreclosure\">Occupy our Homes</a> put solidarity into practice by using the movement\u2019s transformative vision to secure shelters for the homeless in foreclosed buildings.\n\n<strong>A commons challenge for today\u2019s generations</strong>. In this situation, what are the ways to grow the commons? How can citizens be granted open, equitable access to common resources? What\u2019s the needed infrastructure to access the commons, and how can it be built and paid for? What\u2019s the role of states in these areas? Perhaps even harder: how do we deal with commons that are global in nature - air, water, radio frequencies, the Internet, biodiversity - given that there is no global government?\n\nCaring for commons means more than just regulating. Caretakers are needed, that is, a system nurturing societal cooperation, sharing of goods and thoughtfulness of generations to come. It entails establishing norms that reduce free riding and hold communities together. For our generation seems to be moving beyond viewing commons only as a norm, and taking action to enable and protect them in all spheres of our lives.\n\n<strong>The aim of this campaign is to learn how to build a common pool of resources and use them well</strong>. For this we need to look into the potential that commons have to improve our lives, how such a potential is being used and could be improved on, what\u2019s stoping us and how we get around the difficulties, and what works already and could be pushed further. This is about using common resources to further our values. How can we all help that happen?\n\n<strong><em>Help the Council of Europe and the European Commission to think about the issue in new ways and come up with innovative policies.

In these cities, in the last year, groups of <strong>knowledge workers</strong> (visual and performing art workers, researchers, technicians, cultural managers, people who work with cinema, publishing, translation, radio, journalism), but also students and citizens have occupied some theatres and spaces destined to culture.\n\nI lived and visited these places, I interviewed the occupants, I participated to the assemblies.\n\nI anticipated something about this experience in a comment to the mission <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/taking-streets/mission_case/taking-theatres\">Taking the Theatres</a>, but now I want to give a deeper vision of these facts. I collected a lot of materials and so I\u2019ll divide this mission in two parts: in this one there is a general description of what is happening and why, in the<a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/protecting-and-enhancing-commons/mission_case/legitimate-illegality-culture-commons-journey-through-\"> next post</a> there is a deeper analysis about the social and cultural value of these facts and more information about the modality of governance and management of these spaces.\n\nIn Italy the media are talking about these occupations rarely and without giving a true idea of the situation. Instead I think that what is happening is very important!\n\nCulture as commons, precariousness, welfare, cultural policies and wasting of resources are the themes at the base of the occupations of spaces, spaces that can be considered as symbols of contradictions:\n\nRome \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.nuovocinemapalazzo.it/\"><strong>Cinema Palazzo</strong></a> occupied in <strong>April 2011</strong> by a group of inhabitants of the neighborhood, citizens, activists and knowledge workers because it had to be transformed in a Casino run by organized crime. After almost 1 year of occupation the judge declared legitimate the occupation against the owner company. The occupants require a place to produce and to offer culture related not only with the neighborhood, but with the all city, like many years ago when the palace was cinema and theatre.\n\nRome \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.teatrovalleoccupato.it/\"><strong>Valle Theatre</strong></a><strong>, </strong>an historic theatre built in XVIII century, occupied in<strong> June 2011</strong> by a group of cultural workers because it risked to be closed for the suppression of ETI (public institution that dealt with the promotion and distribution of the Italian theater, also abroad). After the closure the theatre would been managed by a private society, but the occupants claim the public property for the mission of the theatre.\n\nVenice<strong> \u2013</strong> \u00a0<a href=\"http://www.saledocks.org/?page_id=4\"><strong>Marinoni Theatre</strong></a> occupied in<strong> September 2011</strong> by a group of venetian knowledge workers (who already manages two spaces in Venice: S.a.L.E. Docks and Laboratorio Occupato Morion), students and the occupants of Valle Theatre during the famous Festival of Cinema because it had been allocated 37 million euro to build the new Cinema Palace. It was only a speculation and the palace was never built, while in the same area the beautiful Marinoni Theater was crumbling to ruins.\n\nMilan <strong>\u2013 PAC (Contemporary Art Pavilion) </strong>temporarily occupied the <strong>3rd December 2011 </strong>by a group of <strong><a href=\"http://www.lavoratoridellarte.org/\">Art Workers of Milan</a></strong> and the occupants of Valle Theatre and Marinoni Theatre to talk about culture as commons and the precariousness of the knowledge workers\n\nCatania<strong> \u2013 </strong><a href=\"http://www.teatrocoppola.it/\"><strong>Coppola Theatre</strong></a><strong>, </strong>the first municipal theater in the city turned into a warehouse and closed since II World War, occupied in <strong>December 2011 </strong>\u00a0by a group of Sicilian art and culture workers.\n\nThe occupants consider the occupation like a liberation of the theatre and they delivered the space with the intention to build an independent place to artistic and professional training, to share their professional skills and to turn them into material goods for the community\n\nNaples \u2013 <strong>Madre Museum</strong> temporarily occupied the 29th<strong> January 2012 </strong>by a Neapolitan collective of performing art and immaterial workers and by the occupants of Valle, Marinoni and Coppola Theatres and the Art Workers from Milan. The occupation happened to do a public assembly about the different experiences of occupations and to talk about culture as commons also with academics and lawyers.\n\nNaples<strong> - Ex Asilo Filangieri </strong>\u00a0occupied in <strong>March 2012</strong> by <strong><a href=\"http://labalena.wordpress.com/\">La Balena</a></strong><strong>,</strong> Neapolitan collective of performing art and immaterial workers. The place is an historic palace in the centre of the city renovated with the investment of 8 million euro to be the location of the Universal Forum of Cultures in 2013. Before the event the palace is supposed to host and produce cultural events, but after the opening it was no longer used except as a place of some administrative offices of the Forum.\n\nPalermo \u2013 <a href=\"http://teatrogaribaldiaperto.wordpress.com/\"><strong>Garibaldi Theatre</strong></a> , built in XIX century, that has always alternated periods of use and disuse (until becoming a venue for illegal boxing matches). It restored in 2008 with the investment of 4,5 million euro, but inexplicably closed. It has occupied in <strong>April 2012</strong> by a group of Sicilian knowledge workers, the occupants of Coppola and Valle Theatre.\n\nPalermo \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.cantierizisa.it/news/questo-non-e-un-cinema/\"><strong>Cinema </strong>inside<strong> Cantieri della Zisa</strong></a> occupied by a group of Sicilian knowledge workers in <strong>\u00a0April 2012</strong>. The Cantieri della Zisa is a dismissed industrial area, recovered to be the site of cultural activities, but the Cinema (the only one public in the city) was closed from 4 years.\n\nThese spaces are symbols of a catastrophic cultural policies and of the rhetoric of creative cities andlarge-scale events in a time when social policies make work and life extremely difficult, not only for knowledge workers.\n\nIf there are no economic resources and the funds to culture production are cut, why are millions of euros allocated to restore a theater that will never be in use?\n\nIf there are no economic resources, why does the Biennale have the money to pay the rent of the buildings on the Grand Canal for the exhibitions, while their workforce is made \u200b\u200bby workers unpaid or underpaid (a lot of them doing internships)?\n\n<strong>the protest and the counter \u2013 proposal</strong>\n\nin the so-called \"knowledge based economy\" of course it is knowledge workers who produce the key-value of economic performance, but this value is not equitably redistributed: precariousness affects knowledge workers. But this happens also because the Italian legislative system and the current welfare system penalize the knowledge workers.\n\nInterviews revealed that they have identified some \"capture systems\" of their value, beyond the legal system: unpaid internships, cultural policies based on the rhetoric of the creative city and great events, creative industries.\n\nAnd so is from these symbolic spaces the occupants protest against\u00a0 <strong>cultural policies</strong>, in particular against the financing procedures, the carelessness of spaces and ask a new <strong>welfare system</strong>.\n\nWith the help of lawyers and economists it is developing a proposal of welfare and they are also designing and testing new forms of legislation and administration of the spaces in which culture is understood as a commons. It is an hard work based also on a careful study of the Italian Constitution to find some ways to legitimate these illegitimate occupations (and the article 43 seems to be a good way, above all for the Valle Theatre, but it is too long to explain here).\n\nWhat the occupants define <strong>culture as a commons</strong> is the need for a broader participation of citizens and workers in cultural policies and more transparency in the allocation of funding.\n\nThe experimental forms of legislation, governance and management of the spaces, sharing of means of production mentioned above could be tools to begin this new era.\n\nThe groups of occupants recognize a similarity with the Arab spring, the Occupy movement, the Spanish Indignados, but In Italy these groups form a network, not a movement. They defined themselves \"constituent groups\" i.e. they don\u2019t aspire to be a minority, but they aspire to have a large representation of citizenship, to combine advanced forms of conflict with the ability to build consensus and participation by different parts of population.\n\nAnd indeed the citizen participation to the assemblies and to the occupations is large. there are also people that would never have thought of entering an occupied space.\n\nThe participation is broader especially since the reform of labor law in Italy, proposed after Berlusconi's government, puts in the same legislative situation of the knowledge workers also all the independent workers and who hasn't a contract of indefinite duration.\n\nThe occupants specifically want: a new labor law and a new welfare system inspired by the right of citizenship (formulated by Balibar) and by the specific indemnity for intermittent work of French system of welfare; they want open data on public funding, transparency in the appointment of artistic directions, real participation in public policy and in decision making related to their field\n\nThey think that arts, culture, education, generically knowledge should not be based on the production of economic wealth, because they are the foundation for building and for developing an healthy and informed community, then the State can' t fund paying attention only to the economic return.\n\nin the <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/protecting-and-enhancing-commons/mission_case/legitimate-illegality-culture-commons-journey-through-\">next post</a> you can read more about\n\n<strong>Relations with Institutions </strong>\n\n<strong>What are they doing inside the occupied spaces?</strong>\n\n<strong>Participation,</strong> <strong>citizenship and</strong> <strong>neighborhood</strong>\n\n<strong>Social and cultural value of \u201cillegal\u201d spaces</strong>\n\n<strong>Final cuts and a new vocabulary</strong>\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-04 19:10:09", "updated_at": "2017-08-29 09:49:02.740509", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1743, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 20.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12944, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 6417, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Also Anders</b>\n\nHe would like to come, and has some experience.
