[{"id": 33952, "user_id": 3674, "topic_id": 6635, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hello open rampette followers!\n\nThe last update was about the prototypes selection, now we would like to share with you what\u2019s happened in the last period.\n\nWe have been quite busy lately doing what makers do: programming, soldering, 3d printing etc\u2026 we built several doorbell prototypes and an app that let the user perform the call via Bluetooth. \n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/998a1f88fa71ccb69605035a5e4e405380097106.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"599\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f2e3cff9952724a77b029a7b71514a8d6034ed93.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"517\">\n\nFrom July 19 to July 26 it has been a super intense week, during which we started a new experience with the community. We have got in touch with several shopkeepers based in Isola district in Milan who already have \u201caccessible\u201d shop, and we asked them the availability to take part in the user testing of the prototypes. Once they accepted our proposal, we gave them all the technical information and  we installed in their shops the devices:\n\n* The doorbell  with the sticker on it to identifies the project\n* The custom device to receive the doorbell call\n* Moreover we created a full instruction sheet.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c30b14acb87b676a8ce474df6ddf7df710f2d372.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"488\">\n\n**TESTING THE DOORBELL WITH THE SHOPOWNERS**\nDuring the week the shop owners and the citizens had the opportunity to test the system proposed and reflect on advantages and the pain points. \nAt the end of the seventh day we interviewed the shopkeepers and about their experience with the new prototype. It was a very precious moment to collect a lot of interesting feedback to better understand what features should be improved and what already works well. In summary, the doorbell was valued quite positively from the shop owners:\n\n* The doorbell is easily visible by the street.\n* The sticker placed on the doorbell is really clear, it works well to communicate accessibility. Waiting for the implementation of the final products, the shopkeepers are available to place the sticker outside their shop.\n\n**TESTING THE DOORBELL WITH DIONISO**\nOn the same day we met one of our Dioniso, he reached us in order to test our solution in two different ways: \n\n* Calling the shop through the doorbell.\n* Using the app, which notifies him the presence of the accessible shop and allows him to request assistance directly from the smartphone.\n\nIn both these cases, the process worked smoothly and Dioniso was pleased to give us his impressions. \nGenerally speaking, the device was appreciated by our Dioniso: He highlighted that the proposed solution is way more effective than the former doorbell:\n\n* It is more visible. \n* It clearly indicates its function.\n* And moreover helps in communicating that the shop is ready and willing to put down a ramp if he asks for help\n\nDioniso confirmed our assumption regarding the app:\n\n* It's a functional solution for people with limited movement capabilities of the arms and the others in general.\n* It could be useful for shops where the doorbell is badly, or where a big step create an obstacle between Dioniso and the bell itself.\n\nWe couldn\u2019t test the app with any user that uses voice commands to control his smartphone, but the test done at the lab using Android Accessibility Features with voice control went very well. We were able to use the app and call for assistance without touching the screen at all :)\n\n**FUTURE IMPROVEMENT**\nThe test helped us also realize that some features that seemed very important during the user research were not so relevant in the end. \n\n* In every flow we proposed, we stressed the aspect of giving a clear feedback about  the reception of the call for assistance; During the test we realized that it is not that relevant, as people use the bell in the way they are used to and don\u2019t expect it to light up in different ways to highlight different statuses.\n* We put a lot of effort in creating a device with a \u201csilent\u201d mode, using just light and vibration, and unfortunately we had just a very little time to work on the fundamental \u201cloud speaker\u201d feature. In the end, we developed a very silent doorbell receiver, that is not really appropriate in most circumstances.\n* Since several people expressed during the research that they have shops with several rooms, we thought that creating a portable device could have been the solutions for all. However, a device that you carry around is easy to forget on a remote desk. For the future implementation, we recommend adopting the strategy of having multiple receivers to spread around the shop.\n\nGenerally speaking the most important confirmation we had from the prototype was about the importance of effectively communicating the accessibility of the shop. \nWhile we really like the doorbell we designed, it could be interesting to try an hybrid and definitely \u201ccheaper\u201d solution using the sticker with an off the shelf wireless doorbell already adopted in many in of the town.", "created_at": "2017-08-04 07:04:51.331745", "updated_at": "2017-10-05 16:17:59.563938", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 823, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 71.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 38228, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 6632, "post_number": 32, "raw": "paging @gehan here. \n\nRemember there is a separate thread for this.

Is there a plan, is it up for expansion, if we start at 'a' can we develop in the direction of 'pX3' ?\u00a0</span>\n\nFor example, my area is of one type and I have certain needs of facilitation for what I do. I imagine the same can be said for most\u00a0among us.\u00a0In short , some of us are farmers, others thinkers, others programmers and others still sales-people, diplomats, social critics , anarchists, slack-and-hack-tivists and so on. If this is to work there has to be something in it that satisfies the 'potential future' aspirations of each member.\u00a0\n\nIf this kind of flexibility is built into the organization then I believe it can work and will support it wholly.

These people 'can' move the rock. Now imagine, as is the truth of our case, that the lever is 'people' or 'community', without the lever there is no chance whatsoever to move the rock, the lever is not inanimate, in fact the lever must choose of itself to be 'applied'. This work is mutual facilitation, lets never forget that.

Or, to paraphrase Ross, why would people self-isolate just because a slightly creepy experimental app with 'invisible smarts' tells them they should?\n\nContact tracing works because it erects a 'barrier' around a known infected person by testing everyone they've been in close contact with, and quarantining not only the original infected person but any who have been infected by them (and then the ones they've infected) - even *before* they are symptomatic. We don't (only) need apps, for the apps to work - we need more human contact tracers and tests!

We are responsible for our thoughts. We are responsible for the environmnent around us, we are responsible for managing our community.\n\nUntil now, mankind has been dismal to manage the needs of the community. Poverty, hunger, social injustice, unequal distribution of wealth, wars, etc. In Claude Lelouch's movie 'La Belle histoire' (The Beautiful Story), he interviews Hubert Reeves about the future (see this scene/interview <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x49sq9_prevoir-lavenir-hubert-reeves_tech\">here</a>).

The following paragraphs are a translation of this post in English.\n\nThe concept of wisdom of crowds (a book by James Surowiecki; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Wisdom-Crowds-Collective-Economies-Societies/dp/0385503865\">http://www.amazon.com/Wisdom-Crowds-Collective-Economies-Societies/dp/0385503865</a>) is what is, in my opinion, the most exciting in the Web 2.0 phenomenon. \"Collectively people know more than what people from the top think,\" says James Surowiecki. When this concept is applied to governance, or open government, it becomes possible to improve society.\n\n\"<em>The groups are smarter when people act individually</em>,\" says James Surowiecki.\n\nWhy is there more intelligence released? I know that many people do not believe in quantum physics. But it is not because you cannot see the smallest of particles that they do not exist. Quantum physics provided me with some answers.\n\nThis year, I spent much time to read about consciousness, which is a field, or collective consciousness. If we conceive the human consciousness as an infinite field, each person being a localized expression of this field, the fact that part of the field can affect the other becomes quite plausible. This is how a field works. Regardless of its location in the earth's magnetic field, a compass always spontaneously aligns with it.\n\nIn the experience of the hundredth monkey, intelligence behaved self-referentially. It jumped over the barriers of the \"impossible.\" This would be the natural behavior of intelligence that influences itself, within itself and by itself. It knows no absolute obstacles. It knows how to blaze new trails. When need be, it creates new realities.\n\nIn a context of collective consciousness, a comment from Lyall Watson (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyall_Watson\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyall_Watson</a>) is revealing: \"<em>It is possible that when enough take one thing to be true, it becomes true for everyone.</em>\"\n\nSince the collective consciousness is a reality, we should be able to take advantage of it. Studies of the effects of the collective consciousness show fascinating results. Candace Borland discovered that when the number of meditators in a city reaches 1% of the population, the crime rate decreases spontaneously. These results seem unlikely as long as you do not understand that reality is formed in the collective consciousness. Once admitted this fact, these results become fascinating and reveal promising possibilities to create a positive and progressive human reality.\n\nIt is difficult to prove if there is a link between the paradigm of consciousness, and variables such as crime rates, armed conflicts, the number of road accidents, diseases, and various other quality of life measures. So why these results? Because intelligence is one. The One is All and All is One. \"<em>Every drop of sap contains the fullness of the whole tree</em>.\" (Maharishi Mahesh Yogi)\n\nIf the individual intelligence is able to cure a disease, to introduce thoughts of peace and love, to eliminate stress within the spirit and lead to positive attitudes, I believe it can also happen at a larger scale, the scale of society.\n\n\"<em>I believe that every of our action has a universal dimension</em>,\" said the Dalai Lama.\n\nDuring the process of transcendence, the meditator does not try to control thought crime, war and disease. He only opens his attention to his Self. Once this is accomplished, the mind spontaneously does the rest.\n\n\"<em>This remarkable new technology to make coherent collective consciousness may not only improve the quality of urban life, but also resolve international conflicts and ensure world peace</em>\", say the experts in transcendental meditation.\n\nKnowing this, also understanding quantum physics, through platform of open government, I believe it will be possible (one day) for humanity to solve its most pressing and complex problems. I am an optimist!\n\nI believe in the miraculous power of social media. It is reshaping the way we communicate. It might as well help to reinvent our societies.\n\n<h2><strong>WHO ENCOURAGED ME TO TAKE THE RISK?</strong></h2><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_kJn-uOzMQyo/TPwAN45MNsI/AAAAAAAAAMQ/v0KpEx9n0kQ/s320/adrielhampton.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_kJn-uOzMQyo/TPwAN45MNsI/AAAAAAAAAMQ/v0KpEx9n0kQ/s320/adrielhampton.jpg\" style=\"width: 238px; height: 320px;\">\u00a0 <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTxaKa404r52ktD9oCW_UDdxuhLMI_cp_W5yFQjegQKSc2vUtdtbofJe2T6\"></a>\n\nPHOTOS: Adriel Hampton\n\n<u>ADRIEL HAMPTON</u> (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/AdrielHampton\">@AdrielHampton</a> ; <a href=\"http://www.adrielhampton.com/\">http://www.adrielhampton.com</a>) from San Francisco United States, encouraged me and pushed me to become an open government advocate. \"<em>Be bold</em>\", were his last recommendation to me, when I met him in October 2010 in Edmonton (Alberta, Canada). They still resonate in my mind.\n\nAdriel Hampton is a passionate advocate for harnessing emerging technologies to make government more effective, collaborative and transparent. Adriel is chief organizer for <a href=\"http://nationbuilder.com/\">NationBuilder</a>, a software platform for organizing, co-founder and producer of the <a href=\"http://gov20radio.com/\">Gov 2.0 Radio</a> podcast, and president of the <a href=\"http://sftechdems.org/\">San Francisco Technology Democrats</a>. He is a <a href=\"http://adrielhampton.com/speaking\">professional speaker</a> and advises governments, politicians, NGOs and businesses on social media and technology innovation. He is also an organizer for various civic tech events.\n\nI have know Adriel for many years. Even before Barack Obama signed the \"Memorandum <em>on Transparency and Open Government</em>\", issued in January 2009. (Ref <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/TransparencyandOpenGovernment/\">http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/TransparencyandOpenGovernment/</a> and <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/memoranda_2010/m10-06.pdf\">http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/memoranda_2010/m10-06.pdf</a> ).\n\n\"<em>Wired to Share</em>\" (<a href=\"http://adrielhampton.wordpress.com/\">http://adrielhampton.wordpress.com</a> ), edited by Adriel, was one of my favorite blogs, when I was an active member of the digital landscape of pandemic flu known as the Flublogia.\n\nAfter open government was launched in United States in 2009, in order to learn about this new type of governance, I started covering open government events live in French on Twitter. In March 2009, I informally covered the government 2.0 un-conference (<a href=\"http://gov20camp.eventbrite.com/\">http://gov20camp.eventbrite.com/</a>), among others led by Dr. Mark Drapeau (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/cheeky_geeky\">@cheeky_geeky</a>), which took place in Washington. For two years, I voluntarily assured a French language coverage on Twitter of Gov20Radio (<a href=\"http://www.blogtalkradio.com/gov20\">http://www.blogtalkradio.com/gov20</a>), founded and produced by Adriel Hampton.\n\nI pause here, but I will return to Adriel in a few paragraphs.\n\nI turned the switch off\u00a0 Zonegrippeaviaire.com on January 6th, 2010. My heart was not there anymore. \u00a0I administrated this forum for three years, despite the refusal of collaboration by the Government of Quebec. In 2006 and 2007, high spheres government officials from both provincial and federal levels expressed amusement at me when I told them a pandemic was soon to occur. \"<em>There is no risk for anyone to die from a pandemic</em>\", they said. \"<em>Only the government has the right to think about these issues</em>\". \"<em>There can be only one unique Web site to publish information and directives to citizens during a pandemic</em>\".\n\nWell, it turned out that I was right. A pandemic did emerge. On June 11, 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) signaled that a global pandemic of novel influenza A (H1N1) was underway by raising the worldwide pandemic alert level to Phase 6.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.culturemauricie.ca/fichiers/Image/LyneRobichaud/Topiaire_vert.jpg\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 185px;\">\u00a0 <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/50552_102779443118197_5597_n.jpg\" style=\"width: 200px; height: 130px;\"> <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.culturemauricie.ca/fichiers/Image/LyneRobichaud/Lyne_Robichaud01_lt.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 300px;\">\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4100/4901208539_13e50127a3.jpg\">\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://a8.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash2/s320x320/75308_121434837919324_102779443118197_142210_1436781_n.jpg\" style=\"width: 320px; height: 240px;\">\n\nPHOTOS: Quilled pieces made with paper (topiaries, various decorative objects and jewelry, by Lyne Robichaud, 2010\n\nIn January 2010, my heart was hurt. I had spent five years of gigantic efforts to build a Flublogian community of practice, and it had lead me nowhere. I completely unplugged from social media, and decided to undertake a second artistic career, as a craft artist. I started quilling. I quilled and quilled and quilled, over 12 hours a day, for six months. (See the definition of quilling <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quilling\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quilling</a>). I produced close to 800 quilled pieces, and had many exhibits of my work in craft shows. I quilled so much\u2026 that I reached a state of bliss.\n\nIn the Summer of 2010, my ex-collegue from Web Escape Agents introduced me to Empire Avenue (<a href=\"http://empireavenue.com/about\">http://empireavenue.com/about</a>), the online social stock market, a Canadian initiative lead by Brad Grier (<a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/bradgrier\">http://www.linkedin.com/in/bradgrier</a>). Six months without talking to a single soul were beginning to weigh on me, so I decide to give Empire Avenue a try.\n\nTo my surprise, I discovered that my friend Adriel Hampton was the king of the virtual stock market. He was No.1 on the global leaderboard of Empire Avenue. I very quickly found my way in this virtual game. Adriel spotted me and enrolled me in the ***School of gifted newbies of Professor Aracalm*** (a prestigious education institution!). Adriel is so <em>wired to share</em> that he took the time to coach others. \"<em>What is your secret for success in social media</em>?\", I asked Adriel. He answered: \u201c<em>I have ways and ways and ways and ways</em>\u201d. Aracalm actually exists on Twitter, the Fake Joe Biden @TheFakeJoeBiden on the Avenue (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#%21/thefakejoebiden\">http://twitter.com/#!/thefakejoebiden</a>). It is one of the many virtual identities of the phenomenal Adriel Hampton. Under the wing of my talented mentor, I managed to maintain myself in the global Top 10 of Empire Avenue.\n\nDragon_flaming (Denise Caron, Vice President, Technology Transformation at <a href=\"http://www.shaw.ca/\">Shaw Communications</a>) was on the rise in Empire Avenue. At the end of August 2010, she convinced me to co-administrate an online community within Empire Avenue. The Dragon\u2019s Cave quickly became extremely popular among users and Dragon_flaming was the first woman to hit the 100 mark on Empire Avenue. But Adriel Hampton was outraged when I followed Dragon_Flaming. \"<em>My student betrays me</em>\". It was nothing but a game, but I was torn between my friendship for Adriel and Denise.\n\nI fell into an uncontrollable burst of tears. For some reason, I was suddenly very afraid to lose Adriel\u2019s friendship. Wrenching sobs, endless stream of tears, shook me for several hours. But what was happening there? Never in my life had I had cried this much! Not even for a lover or the death of loved ones. I realized that there must have been a deeper reason --- yes, an invisible force --- pushing me towards Adriel. From that moment, I knew that whatever would happen to me in life, I would always keep a link with Adriel. I have no rational explanation about this link with Adriel. The link is there, strong, eternal. I do not ask myself more questions. That's the way it is, and that's all.\n\nDragon_Flaming, Adriel and I were reconciled, and Adriel joined the Dragon's Cave.\n\n<img alt=\"Adriel Hampton, Lyne Robichaud, Jordan Hodges\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kJn-uOzMQyo/TMRlxKIheuI/AAAAAAAAADo/OlJbnyvH2rA/s1600/Beyond2010_2ndDay-026C_lt.jpg\" style=\"width: 300px; height: 211px;\">\n\nPHOTO: Adriel Hampton, Lyne Robichaud, Jordan Hodges (meeting in Edmonton)\n\nIn October 2010, I decided to go meet Adriel in person, and several other open government advocates, in Edmonton, Alberta (Canada), at the Beyond Edmonton conference organized by Chris Moore, Chief Information Officer of City of Edmonton (<a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherjmoore\">http://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherjmoore</a>).\n\nIt was my \"baptism\" into the world of open government. \"<em>Be bold</em>\", said Adriel.\n\nThose who inspire influence beyond what can be imagined.\n\n<h2><strong>HOW DID I BUILD THE COMPETENCES TO EVEN BE IN THE DEBATE? </strong></h2><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.psleader.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/JohnFMoore.jpg\" style=\"width: 150px; height: 128px;\">\n\nPHOTO: John F Moore\n\nShortly after the Beyond Edmonton conference, I met <u>JOHN F MOORE</u> (<a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/johnfmoore\">http://www.linkedin.com/in/johnfmoore</a>), from Massachussetts United States, founder and CEO of Government in the Lab (<a href=\"http://govinthelab.com/\">http://govinthelab.com</a>). John is an open government strategist, consultant, and analyst.\u00a0He has experience working with governments and small and medium business owners to achieve their goals.\u00a0 His experience with social media strategies, CRM, and a plethora of other solutions provides immense value to clients.\u00a0 John is also\u00a0a prolific blogger,\u00a0a frequent speaker on open government, government 2.0 and social business strategies, and has\u00a0grown strong, thriving communities across the web. In addition to being the Founder and CEO of The Lab he is a Strategic Advisor to <a href=\"http://www.silberberginnovations.com/\">Silberberg Innovations</a> (<a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/alanwsilberberg\">Alan W. Silbergerg</a> is also an open governement strategist, consultant and analyst) has founded CityCamp Boston (an event focused on bringing together citizens and governement, to share perspectives and insights about the city, leading to measurable and strategic outcomes), and is a contributor to Fortune.com, writing about open government and other government related issues.\n\nAfter graduating from the School of gifted newbies of Professor Aracalm (I really did, Adriel AKA Aracalm sent me a diploma!), I embarked on a thrilling experience with John Moore. I learned a lot.\n\nJohn believes that open government creates jobs (see \"<a href=\"http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2010/11/11/creating-jobs-for-the-people-through-open-government/\">Creating jobs for the people through open government</a>\", one of John's articles in Fortune). Humm humm.\n\nJohn is a very bright thought leader and change agent, one of the top editors of the open government sphere. But on this point, I think he is a little too optimistic. Or maybe ahead of his time. Although we presented relevant and well designed projects, we were not able to develop an economically viable open government market (linked to Francophones).\n\nI did not learn technical things, details about open data, for instance. These things do not interest me very much. I consider that tools are ephemeral. I prefer to focus on strategies. Curiously, I learned about human behavior. The more John and I sank in adversity, the more I discovered about decision makers and managers' behavior towards change.\n\n<h2><strong>IF YOU WANT TO WORK WITH OPEN GOVERNMENT, IS IT NOT EASIER TO DO IT IN TORONTO, OR EVEN IN OBAMA\u2019S AMERICA?</strong></h2>The City of Toronto and several other municipalities in Ontario have an open data initiative, but there is no open government yet in this Canadian province.\n\nThe City of Montreal (province of Quebec) recently announced on October 28, 2011, an open data initiative, thus becoming the first Francophone city in America to tap into this open data <span>experience.</span>\n\nIn Canada, only the provincial government of British Colombia has taken a very serious open government turn.\n\nIn Quebec, the final report of the Gautrin group about the potential of Web 2.0, is expected in mid-december 2011. I am really looking forward to read this report.\n\nThe federal government of Canada has launched an open government initiative on March 18, 2011.

I tend to focus less on technical issues than strategic issues.\n\nThe past months of my advocacy have been very difficult, even painful. This is not the first time I get smashed by failure.

Silberberg (<a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/alanwsilberberg\">http://www.linkedin.com/in/alanwsilberberg</a>), where collaborators from many countries are involved, only the recent Open Government Partnership (<a href=\"http://www.opengovpartnership.org/\">http://www.opengovpartnership.org/</a>) comes to my mind as a multilateral initiative, where a Canadian like me could perhaps eventually get involved (???).\n\nMy numerous American friends from the open government sphere have been very nice with me, during the years that I have celebrated their open government projects and successes.\n\nAlthough English is the language of business, and even if the Open Government Partnership is open to most countries of the United Nations,<strong> I keep thinking that a complementary multilateral open government cut-up project for the Francophonie community would be a good thing</strong> (for everyone).\n\n<h2>\n\n<strong>HOW DID I COME UP WITH THIS GRAND INTERNATIONAL FRANCOPHONE VISION OF OPEN</strong> <strong>GOVERNMENT?</strong>\n\n</h2><strong><u>BUILDING PHASE</u></strong>\n\nI joined John F Moore\u2019s Government in the Lab (<a href=\"http://govinthelab.com/\">http://govinthelab.com/</a>) around November 2010. I was the first Francophone open government advocate,\u00a0 writing in French, to publish blog posts about open government in the United States.\n\nMy first post at TheLab was entitled \"<a href=\"http://lynerobichaud.blogspot.com/2010/11/gov-20-multilingual-communication.html\">Gov2.0 multilingual communication strategies</a>\", original version <a href=\"http://lynerobichaud.blogspot.com/2010/11/strategies-de-communication-multilingue.html\">in French</a>. This multilingual vision had a considerable positive influence on TheLab\u2019s development.\n\nJohn Moore and I focused our efforts to build a community of practice. On Twitter, we asked for content contributors, from all over the world, to post in their own language. In just a few months, thanks to John\u2019s fantastically great community building skills (it was so fascinating watching him ride), and my input, TheLab had more than 300 bloggors writing in 8 different languages: English, French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, Japanese, Arabic and Russian. Government in the Lab was the first \u2013 in the government sphere \u2013\u00a0 to bring together as many authors, writing in so many different languages.\n\nFrom my first failure with the Quebec government, the criticism I received was that social media is \u201c<strong>immature and not credible</strong>\u201d. I think I took it personally. I worked hard to never hear these criticisms again. What I was unaware is that decision makers are rather full of imagination when it comes to find excuses to say NO and reject change.\n\nTherefore, at that time, I had two major concerns:\n\na) To work hard on my personal development --- to ensure that the \u201cimmature\u201d side would vanish completely from my life, once and for all;\n\nI engaged in a self-taught training about individual empowerment. I read more than 30 books by Deepak Chopra, and many from other authors, like Baird T. Spalding. \u201c<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Life-Teaching-Masters-Far-East/dp/0875165389\">Life and Teaching of the masters of the Far East</a>\u201d has become my favorite bed side reading. I read about quantum physics, etc. After much research and exploration, I discovered, around September 2011, that I had become full fledge \u201c<strong>Kundalini </strong>awakened\u201d (<span>ku</span>\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b, Sanskrit: \u0915\u0941\u0923\u094d\u0921\u0932\u093f\u0928\u0940, literally means <em>coiled</em>, a corporeal energy). Suddenly, my whole life appeared to me in a new perspective and my behaviors (weird strange stuff I was unable to explain), since childhood, found an explanation. This is a major achievement, beyond anything else I've done in my life. I am extremely proud and pleased to have reached this physical state of consciousness. Bliss is... wonderful.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.personal-development-coach.net/image-files/seven-chakras.jpg\" style=\"width: 200px; height: 200px;\">\u00a0\u00a0 <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.indianetzone.com/photos_gallery/13/kundalini_18614.jpg\" style=\"width: 200px; height: 226px;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRjBhNGfrxQJxo0PwFbUMhWh10kwEffZjmJmIoAK38CfSBngPAQStUyeHwD\" style=\"width: 150px; height: 173px;\">\u00a0 <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://storage.canalblog.com/03/57/599939/65332981.gif\" style=\"width: 231px; height: 180px;\">\n\nKundalini (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kundalini\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kundalini</a>) is described as a sleeping, dormant potential force in the human organism. Through meditation, and other practices, kundalini is awakened, and rises up through the different chakras (located along the spine). It leads to different levels of awakening and mystical experience, until the kundalini finally reaches the top of the head, the Sahasrara chakra (crown chakra, or lotus of the thousand petals), producing an extremely profound mystical experience. It is permanent irreversible. This video beautifully illustrates kundalini energy and Sarasrara <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV5szIgqnBE\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV5szIgqnBE</a> .

There are currently no open government Francophone strategists. It just doesn\u2019t exist yet. Why? Because no main Francophone country has turned open government, no one has emerged with these skills yet.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://chuvachienes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/shortyawards.gif\" style=\"width: 200px; height: 200px;\">\n\nJohn Moore enrolled in the Government category of Shorty Awards (<a href=\"http://shortyawards.com/\">http://shortyawards.com/</a>).

A pilot program implementation (starting in Senegal) to create tools for implementation, serves as basis for analysis and study of problems, obstacles and successes encountered. The implementation tools are then shared and applied to other French-speaking countries and cities, initially in three other African countries. Then, after a resolution has been filed by Senegal at the OIF Summit (to take place in Congo, in October 2012) and has been adopted by all member States, the pilot program for implementation of open government is implemented in a five-year plan, in 39 francophone countries and 977 of their\n\ncities.\n\n<strong>GOAL</strong>: The overall goal of this project is to position the French language in the digital age by making use of open governance. To accomplish this mission we must think broadly and achieve results across many fronts: economic, cultural, education, and more.\n\nThe entire project has derived from this quote:\n\n<em>\"The Francophonie has reached the end of a cycle, and has been fairly successful. We are now in a digital age, in another space which is being constructed from other materials, other ways of communicating. We must realize that we now live in a world where technology plays a more prominent role. All contents that are existing in Francophone countries, we must digitize them and create available data banks, where people can find them and see them... France, Quebec, and the Francophone community of Belgium and Switzerland, alone, they do not have the critical mass to create enough of these digital contents, and occupy a suitable place in the global cultural competition.\"</em>\n\n[LEVY, Elias, <em>Jean-Louis Roy et la Francophonie: le d\u00e9fi francophone</em>, Voir <a href=\"http://www.voir.ca/publishing/article.aspx?zone=1&amp;section=11&amp;article=60972\">http://www.voir.ca/publishing/article.aspx?zone=1&amp;section=11&amp;article=60972</a>]\n\nWe proposed the strategic implementation of open government across the 70 OIF countries to directly address this challenge.\u00a0 We came up with a five-year plan. The first year was to create the necessary policies, processes, documentation, and other models as well as deliver working solutions for at least one state and several cities on each of the official OIF regional classifications with OIF member countries.\n\nIt was critical (for John Moore and I) that we created repeatable solutions as well as working enviroments that the entire OIF community could look to, in order to understand the need for, and benefits of, open government.\n\nThe first year selection of OIF member states and cities would have been done in a manner that focuses on reaching that critical mass that Jean-Louis Roy speaks of above. It should have been done in a manner that encourages openness across member nations, while recognizing the need to work closely with non-member nations as well. The reasons this is important is because open government best practices, open data standards, etc., are being developed throughout the world, not just within French-speaking countries. We found it was important that best practices were able to be shared, regardless of what country or with what language they are originally created across the world.\n\nThis project was to be overseen by a cross-functional group of key Francophonie stakeholders (exactly like they did for the Open Government Parternership) and be managed based upon a project schedule that delivers components in an interactive fashion allowing for regular monthly progress checkpoints.\n\nFor those unclear about the meaning of open government, John F Moore provided this concise definition in 2010:\n\n<em>A citizen-centric philosophy and strategy that believes the best results are usually driven by partnerships between citizens and government, at all levels. It is focused entirely on achieving goals through increased efficiency, better management, information transparency, and citizen engagement and most often leverages newer technologies to achieve the desired outcomes. This is bringing business approaches, business technologies, to government.</em>\n\nWhy is open government necessary for achieving the goal of positioning the French language in the digital age? Open government principles are the basis upon which many governments across the world are making decisions, engaging and collaborating with citizens by providing government data in digital open data formats and by using social media and other collaborative platforms. The bad news? The majority of this communication is currently taking place using the English language. The good news? It is not too late for the Francophonie to become open government thought leaders and, by delivering real economic results, best of breed solutions and best practices in the French language strengthen the importance of the language on the world-wide stage.\n\nThis project was to be a social enterprise selling open government strategic consulting services to a targeted population, respecting a mission of social character, without sacrificing profitability. In addition to the amounts hoped through funding programs of institutions and partnerships with several organizations and donors reached at a concertation meeting, a fundraiser (private individual) was to be included in the project. I was planning a campaign similar to that conducted by 'Live Below the Line' <a href=\"http://www.livebelowtheline.com.au\">http://www.livebelowtheline.com.au</a>.\n\n******************************************************************************************************************************\n\n<strong>RESUM\u00c9 DE PROJET</strong>\n\n<u>INFORMATIONS SUR LES INSTITUTIONS ET PARTENAIRES</u>\n\n<strong>Titre du projet</strong>: Gouvernement ouvert et Francophonie\n\nPays ou ce projet aura lieu: Phases 1, 2 et 3: S\u00e9n\u00e9gal.

Les modalit\u00e9s de ce leadership sont en train de se mat\u00e9rialiser avec des rencontres ayant d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu lieu avec le minist\u00e8re de la Communication, des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications et des Technologies de l'Information et de la Communication du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal, et seront d'avantage affin\u00e9es lors d'une prochaine rencontre avec le Ministre en personne. Cette demarche permettra d'exposer en quoi consiste le gouvernement ouvert et de souligner les avantages du gouvernement ouvert pour le S\u00e9n\u00e9gal. Les 6 \u00e9tapes du projet sont expliqu\u00e9es, notamment les objectifs esp\u00e9r\u00e9s pour chacune des \u00e9tapes, de m\u00eame que les strat\u00e9gies et actions pr\u00e9vues, les modalit\u00e9s de financement, les partenaires propos\u00e9s, les \u00e9cheanciers de travail. Il est crucial d'obtenir un engagement ferme, un appui politique de la part des plus hautes instances du Gouvernement du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal, notamment le pr\u00e9sident de la R\u00e9publique, Abdoulaye Wade. Une fois que le Gouvernement du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal se sera prononc\u00e9 sur ce projet, nous constituerons une \u00e9quipe collaborative charg\u00e9e de nous accompagner dans les d\u00e9marches d'organisation d'une rencontre de concertation.\n\n<u>\u00c9tape 2: TENUE D'UNE RENCONTRE DE CONCERTATION</u>. Nous concr\u00e9tiserons des investissements de plusieurs institutions du secteur public et priv\u00e9 par la tenue d'une conf\u00e9rence de concertation d'une dur\u00e9e de 2 jours qui se d\u00e9roulera au S\u00e9n\u00e9gal. Il s'agira d'un \u00e9v\u00e9nement de relations publiques et relations internationales, en respect du protocole diplomatique \u00e9tant de mise dans un contexte ou plusieurs dignitaires repr\u00e9sentants d'\u00c9tats membres africains de l'OIF y participeront, de m\u00eame que des repr\u00e9sentants d'organisation internationales. Ces participants auront \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9alablement inform\u00e9s des \u00e9tapes du projet pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es. Ce sera l'occasion de poser des questions, et d'obtenir des commentaires \u00e0 propos du projet, discuter des meilleurs strat\u00e9gies \u00e0 envisager pour la mise en oeuvre des diff\u00e9rentes \u00e9tapes, de rencontrer en personne les partenaires et futurs collaborateurs, entendre les positions des repr\u00e9sentants des\n\n\u00c9tats membres participants et des diverses organisations. \u00c0 la fin de cette rencontre, les repr\u00e9sentants des \u00c9tats membres et des diverses organisations pourront annoncer leurs couleurs et positions lors d'une conf\u00e9rence de presse.\n\n<u>\u00c9tape 3: ANALYSE ET MISE EN OEUVRE D'UNE INITIATIVE DE GOUVERNEMENT OUVERT DU GOUVERNEMENT DU S\u00c9N\u00c9GAL</u>. Ce projet pilote se fera en collaboration avec un Comit\u00e9 compos\u00e9 de repr\u00e9sentants de trois autres \u00c9tats africains membres de l'Organisation internationale de la Francophonie. Les trois premiers mois d'implantation seront consacr\u00e9s \u00e0 des rencontres et \u00e0 une analyse des besoins avec le gouvernement du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal. Le reste de l'ann\u00e9e, le comit\u00e9 panafricain pourra se joindre aux travaux d'implantation, en aidant notamment \u00e0 d\u00e9finir les outils et mesures.\n\nProgramme pilote de gouvernement ouvert: En collaboration avec le Comit\u00e9 africain. Ex\u00e9cuter le programme:\n\nLib\u00e9ration d'ensembles de donn\u00e9es ouvertes. Mettre en ligne d'applications pour soutenir la sensibilisation des citoyens concernant les aspects portant sur les politiques cl\u00e9s. Cr\u00e9er une plate-forme d'id\u00e9es des citoyens, qui permettra aux citoyens d'exprimer leur opinion sur les questions cl\u00e9s du gouvernement. Kiosques et fourgonnettes itinerantes. Lancement de nouvelles entreprises et d'un incubateur d'entreprises pour soutenir et financer de nouvelles entreprises. Cr\u00e9er de la documentation et des guides. Sensibiliser des intervenants sur l'importance de l'ensemble du projet. Cr\u00e9er des cadres communs pour le code (des logiciels applicatifs, codes source ouverts) et de la documentation, afin que les processus soient bien document\u00e9s et que les experiences d'apprentissage puissent \u00eatre partag\u00e9es et reproduites ailleurs. Rapports mensuels des progr\u00e8s par rapport aux param\u00e8tres. L'ajustement du projet s'effectuera sur la base de ces rapports. Proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une analyse post-mortem approfondie afin de s'assurer que tous les membres comprennent ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accompli, qu'ils prennent conscience de tous les succ\u00e8s aussi bien que des \u00e9checs, afin de s'assurer que les tactiques et les strat\u00e9gies seront corrig\u00e9s au besoin. Mettre sur pied une conference afin de souligner les progres accomplis lors de la premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e et d'engager d'autres \u00c9tats membres dans le processus.\n\n<u>\u00c9tape 4: MISE EN PLACE D'UN COMIT\u00c9 COMPOS\u00c9 D'\u00c9TATS POUR LE D\u00c9PLOIEMENT DU GOUVERNEMENT OUVERT SUR LE CONTINENT AFRICAIN</u>. Une fois que les efforts d'implantation du gouvernement ouvert au S\u00e9n\u00e9gal (\u00c9tape 3) seront pleinement en cours, soient apr\u00e8s une periode d'intenviron de 3 mois, il sera essentiel de lancer des efforts comparables dans les autres pays participants. Cela permettra d'assurer que les le\u00e7ons apprises au S\u00e9n\u00e9gal sont appliqu\u00e9es \u00e0 d'autres implantations, dans le but de maximiser le succ\u00e8s global de ces efforts.\n\n<u>\u00c9tape 5: STRAT\u00c9GIE DE RELATIONS GOUVERNEMENTALES CONDUISANT \u00c0 UNE R\u00c9SOLUTION EN FAVEUR DU D\u00c9VELOPPEMENT OUVERT AU PROCHAIN SOMMET DE L'OIF</u>. Cette \u00e9tape concerne les d\u00e9bats relatifs \u00e0 la n\u00e9gociation et \u00e0 l'adoption d'accords internationaux. Comment s'assurer que les d\u00e9clarations ou r\u00e9solutions adopt\u00e9es par la Conf\u00e9rence des chefs d'\u00c9tat et de gouvernement des pays ayant le fran\u00e7ais en partage, c'est-\u00e0-dire le \"Sommet\", sont mises en oeuvre et execut\u00e9es par l'OIIF et les op\u00e9rateurs? Lorsque des partenariats seront \u00e9tablis avec plusieurs \u00c9tats membres, il deviendra possible d'\u00e9tablir les meilleures strat\u00e9gies et les \u00e9tapes \u00e0 franchir. Nous aurons besoin de conseillers experts dans le domaine de la Francophonie, de nombreux parlementaires de l'APF, etc., pour nous guider et sensibiliser un grand nombre de chefs d'\u00c9tat et membres de d\u00e9l\u00e9gations. L'\u00e9tape 5 est une campagne de relations gouvernementales. Notre objectif est de sensibiliser les \u00c9tats membres de l'OIF \u00e0 la philosophie du gouvernement ouvert, et d'identifier quelle serait la meilleure formule qui ferait en sorte qu'un grand nombre d'\u00c9tats membres de l'OIF adoptent cette philosophie, et acceptent de collaborer et de participer \u00e0 un projet d'implantation du gouvernement ouvert sur leur territoire. Notre \u00e9quipe a pens\u00e9 que le prochain Sommet de l'OIF pourrait s'av\u00e9rer une excellente opportunit\u00e9 pour obtenir un consensus. Il pourrait \u00eatre sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 de combiner une r\u00e9solution de soutien du gouvernement ouvert comme forme privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e de gouvernance \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation d'un nouveau vecteur de l'OIF: l'Association internationale des gouvernements ouverts de la Francophonie.\n\n<u>\u00c9tape 6: DEPLOIEMENT D'UN PLAN QUINQUENNAL DE SENSIBILISATION ET D'IMPLANTATION DU GOUVERNEMENT OUVERT CHEZ DES MEMBRES DE L'OIF ET VILLES DE LA FRANCOPHONIE.</u> Une fois qu'une r\u00e9solution, d\u00e9claration, ou autre forme d'accord sera convenue entre les \u00c9tats ayant le fran\u00e7ais en partage, nous avons pr\u00e9vu un plan quinquennal, dont le d\u00e9ploiement permettra l'implantation du gouvernement ouvert dans jusqu'a 50% des pays de l'OIF et pr\u00e8s de 1000 villes francophones.

I refined the project along the way, to respond to what they were telling me and suggesting to do.\n\nSeveral government officials liked the project and encouraged me to continue lobbying. But as months went by, the list of opponents grew. Risk aversion was very high. Opponents had a very important input in the project: they helped me get the picture of the favorable conditions (what would have been necessary to have in place) in order to make the project happen. They helped me uncover <span>the</span> irritants. <span>Even if they</span> were against the project, they helped shape <span>an</span> understanding of what should be changed for the \u201cgrand international Francophone vision of open government\u201d to materialize into the world. <span>In my mind, opponents</span> form a whole and I see them as belonging to the debate and to the project, although they never were put together in a room for a group meeting. Each one of them, they hold a piece of the puzzle. I would like to be able to sit them all in one room, and give them a seminar about what is open government, why and how they should modify their thoughts (perceptions).\n\n<span>If these</span> people \u2013 government managers, elected members of parliament \u2013 simply changed their mind about open government, ***with these same people***, it would become possible to ensure that the project takes place. Why? There is no one other than these people. These are the people in charge. There is only one prime minister, only one minister of digital economy, only one member of parliament per riding. We cannot remake the world in full, and change all the players by replacing them with others more inclined to change. But leaders can come to modify their attitudes. Yes, they can! But first, <strong>they must be aware of their attitudes</strong>. Someone has to explain them. If they have no awareness of their own behavior, they will remain in denial.\n\nJust as there are mandatory ethics classes offered to all elected officials (at least in Quebec), I think there should also be mandatory classes of change of attitudes. Classes about a new type of leadership, and how to adjust the thoughts to move from directive leadership to participatory leadership. <span><span>I</span> </span><span><span>incessantly</span> </span><span><span>tweet</span> <span>about</span> <span>#<strong>leadfromwithin</strong></span><span>, b</span><span>ecause I</span> <span>believe it is an important part of the</span> <span>solution.</span></span>\n\n<strong>RECOVERY PHASE</strong>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.cyberpresse.ca/images/bizphotos/435x290/200810/30/20662.jpg\" style=\"width: 435px; height: 288px;\">\n\nPHOTO: Jean-Paul Diamond\n\nOn September 1<sup>st</sup>, 2011, the d\u00e9put\u00e9 of Maskinong\u00e9, Jean-Paul Diamond, told me, \"<em><strong>There is no solution. </strong>There is nothing at the Quebec government that allows to do this project</em>.\" Hey, what a pessimist view! (Curiously, Jean-Paul Diamond is the spitting image of my (dead) father. When I met him, I had a hard time focusing on his words, I was deeply troubled by the <span><span>physical resemblance).</span></span>\n\nI buried the project. And cried a lot while watching live coverage of the Open Government Partnership launched in New York on September 20, 2011 (<a href=\"http://www.opengovpartnership.org/launch\">http://www.opengovpartnership.org/launch</a>).\n\nShortly after killing the project in my mind (detachment, liberation), I made quantum leaps in my Kundalini awakening (within a few days, I reached the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> fusion, Sahasrara). There is one last fusion for me to reach (transfiguration)... and I will disappear into the light. <span><span>I still have</span> <span>many years</span> <span>in this lifetime</span> <span>to get there.</span></span>\n\n<span><span>Already</span><span>, I can see</span> <span>a</span> <span>pattern.</span> <span>Every time</span> <span>I cash in</span> <span>a</span> <span>major failure</span><span>, it has</span> <span>a positive strong impact on</span> <span>my </span></span><span><span>Kundalini </span></span><span><span>journey</span><span>.</span></span> A month after I turned off Zonegrippeaviaire (in early January 2010), I had the first Kundalini fusion, in early February (first fusion of energy takes place in the heart). <span><span>I</span> <span>had no idea</span> <span>what was happening. I thought I was sick, I thought I had contracted a very strange rare illness, and that I was to die very soon.</span> A similar experience was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kundalini:_The_Evolutionary_Energy_in_Man\">recalled by Gobi Krishna</a>. </span><span>\"</span><em>About two months after awakening the Kundalini Gopi Krishna believed he was about to die. He had been in agonizing pain for hours</em>.\"\n\n<blockquote>\"There were dreadful disturbances in all the organs, each so alarming and painful that I wonder how I managed to retain my self-possession under the onslaught. The whole delicate organism was burning, withering away completely under the fiery blast racing through its interior. <strong>I knew I was dying and that my heart could not stand the tremendous strain for long</strong>.\" (ref <a href=\"http://www.yoga-age.com/articles/kundalini.html\">Georg Feuerstein</a>)\n\n</blockquote><span><span>I passed</span> <span>full medical examinations.</span></span> <span><span>I had</span> <span>a heart ultrasound</span>. Doctors found nothing wrong. It took me 18 months to understand: \"<strong><em>The body has to undergo a huge transformation in order to physically support higher states of consciousness</em></strong>.\" (Deepak Chopra). </span>\n\n<span><span>I can</span> <span>foresee that the</span> <span>next big thing</span> to happen to me <span>will possibly propel</span> <span>me</span> <span>to the</span> <span>highest level</span> <span>of consciousness.</span></span>\n\nThis is the first time that I openly write about my Kundalini experience. <span><span>I went through</span> <span>this situation</span> <span>alone,</span> <span>with nobody</span> <span>to</span> <span>talk to.</span> <span>I am hoping to find</span> <span>people like me</span><span>.</span> <span>I know they</span> <span>exist out there.</span> <span>I am convinced that as we enter a new Age (we are apparently in </span></span>the transition out of the information age and into the age of wisdom<span><span>) more and</span> <span>more people</span> <span>will</span> <span>experience</span> an <span>expanded consciousness</span><span>.</span></span> Kundalini is a very scientific and biological event occuring in the body. Today's research done in the mind and consciousness seems to be coming closer to this understanding. Researchers can see that there are marked physical differences in those men and women who have unlocked this dormant energy.\n\nI thought I was done definitively with this story, but Alberto Cottica (from Edgeryders) pushed me to tell it here. Maybe all is not buried ten feet underground. Who knows, maybe one day my open government dream will become a reality. <span><span>Meanwhile, I</span> <span>am very happy to</span> <span>be part of the</span> <span>great </span></span><span><span>Edgeryders </span></span><span><span>experience</span><span>.</span></span>\n\n", "created_at": "2011-11-19 14:06:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:10.710329", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 10911, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 15.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9619, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 6124, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>What about specs?</b>\n\nWell stated!

As a compromise, an example team drive folder layout might be:\n\n    Team Drive's root folder\n    \u2502\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500 Team CVs etc.\n    \u2502                \n    \u251c\u252c\u2500\u2500 PROJECT ARCHIVE\n    \u2502\u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 Old project 1\n    \u2502\u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 Old project 2 (recyclable)\n    \u2502\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 Old project 3          \n    \u2502                \n    \u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500 Project: POPREBEL\n    \u2502                \n    \u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500 Project: Transformations\n    \u2502                \n    \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500 ...\n\nSo recyclable projects would be marked with a tag in the name, but all inactive projects would go into a \"PROJECT ARCHIVE\" folder. All active projects would have a \"Project: \u2026\" name prefix, keeping them apart from non-project folders without needing one more level of folders. We would not differentiate between potential current projects \u2013 there's not much of a need as both are being worked on, or otherwise they'd move to the archive.\n\nAnd I think we should not move finished projects out of team folders. Nobody likes having access to data taken away for no proper reason, and maybe they need the old data at some time.", "created_at": "2019-02-06 02:42:36.977511", "updated_at": "2019-02-10 11:33:25.919694", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 296, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 13.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [50621], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 87328, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 14902, "post_number": 6, "raw": "Fascinating.

I hope that many of them can be persuaded that they don't really need a car at all.

Depending on my travel schedule, if setup goes well I'd be glad to do some dev on the evening of the 19th. If not everyone can arrive then, that's OK. They can join in when they arrive. :-)\n\nAt the other end, LOTE is going to be super-full of exciting things to be part of and people to talk to, without trying to be hacking while it's happening. I don't want to miss all that because I'm focused on my laptop, so I probably won't do much hacking after the afternoon of the 23rd.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-09-24 16:24:53", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:15.134537", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 166, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3398, "user_id": 1, "topic_id": 3365, "post_number": 1, "raw": "_This topic is a linked part of a larger work: \"[Edgeryders O\u00dc Company Manual](/t/id/6168)\"_\n\n\n## Content\n\n**[1.

Introduction</h2>\n\n**Who can get one.** If you are a core team member of a project executed by the Edgeryders company, or as a volunteer have a designated role in the community (such as helping with community management), you can get an edgeryders.eu e-mail address.\n\n**What it is \u2013 technically.** Your e-mail address will be a full mailbox that allows both sending and receiving, the latter via IMAP and POP3 and by forwarding all e-mails to your regular e-mail address as a copy. Usually you will set up the sending, while receiving e-mails to your regular e-mail address. If you don't want the copies and instead want to access this account directly with IMAP or POP3, tell @matthias.\n\n**Personal and role-based addresses.** We have two formats of e-mail addresses at Edgeryders. First, a personal e-mail address, which will usually be of the form `<firstname>@edgeryders.eu`. By default, a copy of all incoming e-mails is sent to your regular e-mail address, and only to that. Second, role-based e-mail addresses. These are created for roles within Edgeryders (such as contact@edgeryders.eu, finance@edgeryders.eu) and access to them and / or forwarding to their own regular e-mail address is given to the person or persons having that role at the time.\n\n**Make your own backups!** Note that, while your e-mail account will store copies of e-mails you receive, we do not guarantee the long-term data integrity of your e-mails. So back up your Edgeryders e-mails yourself! When you receive them forwarded to your regular e-mail address, as is the default, own backups are simple as Edgeryders' e-mails would automatically be included when your regular e-mails are backed up.\n\n**About the old forward-only addresses.** Before 2017-06, we have handed out e-mail addresses that were pure forwarders to your regular e-mail address, without support for sending via SMTP. Some still have these accounts, but we will switch them to full mailboxes as well. The reason is that the way of sending from these addresses (by adding an identity for your edgeryders.eu address to your regular e-mail account) is no longer possible in GMail, and became too difficult and cumbersome with all other e-mail providers due to \"obligatory\" anti-spam measures like [SPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework).\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2. How to receive and send edgeryders.eu e-mails with Gmail</h2>\n\n**Receiving.** No setup is needed, as normally all e-mails arriving to your ederyders.eu e-mail address will be forwarded to your regular e-mail address \u2013 presumably the Gmail address associated with this Gmail account. Only if you opted out of the forwarding, you have to find a different solution. See the Gmail help article \"[Check e-mails from other accounts](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/21289)\" for that.\n\n**Received e-mails land in spam?** This is a somewhat common issue with e-mails from edgeryders.eu e-mail addresses, since we are one of the few small organizations that self-host their e-mail server and refuse to move to \"the cloud\". What often happens is that Google updates their spam classifier algorithm and then many e-mails from edgeryders.eu are misclassified as spam, until they might fix the issue a few weeks later. To be clear, if Google misclassifies your received e-mails as spam, the issue is on their side \u2013 they provide you a defective product, and no control over the updates to their spam classifier algorithm. They also have a reputation to not listen to problem reports. So here are the remedies that you can do yourself:\n\n1. Follow [Google's instructions](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/1366858#unmark_spam) to unmark an e-mail as spam and whitelist the sender. Unmarking the message as spam will train the spam classifier for the future. But in addition, adding the senders to your contacts or setting up own filters is more reliable to prevent [edgeryders.eu](http://edgeryders.eu) e-mails from going to spam.\n\n2. You can also check which spam warning label it has been assigned by Google ([details](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/1366858#warnings)). Then tell that and any accompanying diagnostic information to @matthias and he might be able to optimize the e-mail sending so that the probability of them being classified as spam is lower.\n\n3. A clean solution is to not use GMail, but to fetch your e-mails in a local e-mail client like Thunderbird. For example, @matthias made good experiences with using  Thunderbird with a local spam filter that is provided by Thunderbird. After some months of training, it works very well, nearly without false-positives. Since it's local and self-trained it, there will be no surprising sudden behavior changes.\n\n**Sending.** Summary: In the GMail web interface, use \":gear: \u2192 Settings \u2192 Account and Import \u2192 Send Mail as: \u2192 Add another e-mail address\" and enter your SMTP settings (server `mail.edgeryders.eu` and your login credentials).\n\nIf you have difficulties, see the detailed instructions in \"Step 1\" to \"Step 3\" sections of the Gmail help article \"[Send emails from a different address or alias](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/22370)\".\n\nIf you still have difficulties, see our annotations on the Gmail help article below.\n\n* **On \"Step 1: Add an address you own\":** the information to enter into the forms is:\n    * **your name:** just your name, no way to make a mistake as every value will be accepted by the form\n    * **address you want to send from:** use the full e-mail address, such as `firstname@edgeryders.eu`\n    * **SMTP server:** `host.edgeryders.eu` (<a title=\"To be changed to mail.edgeryders.eu once updating ISPConfig to a version that issues proper certificates with Subject Alt Name for alias domains.\">todo :speech_balloon:</a>)\n    * **username:** use the full e-mail address given to you, usually it has the form `firstname@edgeryders.eu`\n    * **password:** use the password given to you; it is the same as for receiving e-mails\n    * **Treat as an alias:** yes (the default). Else Gmail would hide e-mails sent to your edgeryders.eu address and then forwarded to your Gmail address. This setting is documented [here](https://support.google.com/a/answer/1710338).\n\n* **On \"Step 2: Confirm the address\":** The confirmation e-mail will regularly arrive to your Gmail account, so simply find and click the confirmation link there. Also check your spam folder if it does not show up in your inbox. If you click on the \"confirm\" link but no window opens (that tells you to either click a link or enter a code received by e-mail), try switching windows (<kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> on Windows) as the window might be already open from an earlier attempt.\n&nbsp;&nbsp; (Explanation: by default, unless you expressly want it differently, all e-mails to your edgeryders.eu e-mail address will be forwarded to your regular e-mail address. This will normally be the same Gmail address where you are logged in right now to set up sending from your edgeryders.eu address. So the confirmation e-mail by Google will also arrive at that Gmail address. If you did indicate you don't want copies to your regular e-mail address, you have to set up IMAP or POP3 access to your edgeryders.eu e-mail address first, in order to see the confirmation e-mail. See below for instructions.)\n\n* **On \"Step 3: Change the \"From\" address\":** You have to do this step for every new e-mail you write that you want to come from your edgeryders.eu e-mail address. Because, your default e-mail address is still your Gmail address, and you probably want to keep it that way.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--3\">3. How to receive and send edgeryders.eu e-mails with Thunderbird</h2>\n\nThis setup process is different but similar in all desktop and webmail software. As an example, here is the process in  [Thunderbird](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/), a free and open source advanced desktop mail client for Windows, Mac OS and Linux.\n\n1. Click \"Edit \u2192 Account Settings\" in the menu.\n\n2. Click \"Account Actions \u2192 Add Mail Account \u2026\".\n\n3. In the form, enter the following:\n\n    * **Your name:** (just enter your name, no way to enter anything wrong)\n    * **Email address:** enter as given to you, usually it has the form `firstname@edgeryders.eu`\n    * **Password:** enter the password given to you\n\n4. Click \"Continue\", then click \"Manual config\" (because Thunderbird is unable to automatically fill in the right values for edgeryders.eu addresses).\n\n5. Enter the following values in the lower section of the manual config form. Most will be already there, guessed correctly by Thunderbird. **_The two values you will have to fix are \"Username: Incoming\" and \"Username: Outgoing\"._** They have been marked in the screenshot and with :bangbang: in the list below. Until we fix some server-side issue, you also have to set both hostnames to `host.edgeryders.eu`, different from the screenshot below.\n\n    ![ThunderbirdConfig|600x289](upload://4VXzO8zECbaO1D9WaAhASgZLPOp.png)\n\n    * **Incoming IMAP:** (means, if you choose protocol IMAP, the default and more modern variant)  \n        * :bangbang: **Server hostname:** `host.edgeryders.eu` (<a title=\"To be changed to mail.edgeryders.eu once updating ISPConfig to a version that issues proper certificates with Subject Alt Name for alias domains.\">todo :speech_balloon:</a>)\n        * **Port:** `143`\n        * **SSL:** `STARTTLS`\n        * **Authentication:** `Normal Password` (<a title=\"This means, transmitting the password in non-hashed form. This is secure because of STARTTLS. It seems that our ISPConfig-configured mail server does not (yet) support MD5 etc. for hashed password transmission.\">reason :speech_balloon:</a>) \n\n    * **Incoming POP3:** (means, if you choose protocol POP3)\n        * :bangbang: **Server hostname:** `host.edgeryders.eu` (<a title=\"To be changed to mail.edgeryders.eu once updating ISPConfig to a version that issues proper certificates with Subject Alt Name for alias domains.\">todo :speech_balloon:</a>)\n        * **Port:** `110`\n        * **SSL:** `STARTTLS`\n        * **Authentication:** `Normal Password`\n\n    * **Outgoing:**\n        * :bangbang: **Server hostname:** `host.edgeryders.eu` (<a title=\"To be changed to mail.edgeryders.eu once updating ISPConfig to a version that issues proper certificates with Subject Alt Name for alias domains.\">todo :speech_balloon:</a>)\n        * **Port:** `587`\n        * **SSL:** `STARTTLS`\n        * **Authentication:** `Normal Password`\n\n    * **Username:**\n        * :bangbang: **Incoming:** the full e-mail address given to you, usually it has the form `firstname@edgeryders.eu`\n        * :bangbang: **Outgoing:** the full e-mail address given to you, usually it has the form `firstname@edgeryders.eu`\n\n6. Click \"Done\". Thunderbird will now try the password you gave, and fetch e-mails from the account.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--4\">4. Special case: How to send edgeryders.eu e-mails using a third-party SMTP server</h2>\n\nThis is only needed in special cases, such as when wanting to employ a third-party newsletter service like Mixmax for sending e-mails originating from edgeryders.eu addresses. Instructions:\n\n1. Ask @matthias to add the third-party SMTP server you want to the SPF record. (This is basically a public list of servers that are allowed to send from edgeryders.eu addresses, meant for spam control, and more or less obligatory to have these days.)\n\n2. If necessary, configure Gmail or your mail client to use this third-party SMTP server. Use the following values:\n\n    * e-mail address: you can use any e-mail address that exists on edgeryders.eu as \"From:\" address, but in order to allow replies it should at least exist\n    * username: the username for access you should have received from the third party operating this SMTP server\n    * password: likewise, to be received from the third party operating this SMTP server\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--5\">5. How to receive e-mails from role-based addresses</h2>\n\nAll our role-based e-mail addresses can forward to any number of other e-mail addresses. So by adding yours to the list of forwarding targets, you \"sign up\" to receive everything that goes to this address. We use this mechanism esp. for cases where we can only register one e-mail address for a specific purpose (such as at our accountants) but several people want to \"be in the loop\".\n\nAt this time, we actively use the following role-based addresses (consider all others legacy or there for technical reasons only):\n\n* **accounting@edgeryders.eu :** Communication with our accountants and other finance related services.\n* **community@edgeryders.eu :** Reaching out to the Edgeryders community.\n* **contact@edgeryders.eu :** Main contact address for the Edgeryders company.\n* **events@edgeryders.eu :** Edgerders conferences (?).\n* **github@edgeryders.eu :** Address associated with the [Github organization account for Edgeryders](https://github.com/edgeryders).\n* **research@edgeryders.eu :** Communication with the [Edgeryders Research Network](/c/research-network).\n* **webmaster@edgeryders.eu :** Contact address for technical issues related to domains, e-mail and webhosting. Also required by [some old Internet standard](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2142). Not (yet) used as the e-mail address associated with our hosting contracts.\n\nThe process to add your address as a forwarding target is as follows:\n\n* **If you are a member of the management board:**\n\n    1. Get the password for the ISPConfig user `edgeryders` from @matthias.\n    2. Log in at https://host.edgeryders.eu:8090/ with username `edgeryders` and the password you have received. Ignore SSL exceptions, and sorry about that.\n    3. In the left sidebar, select \"E-Mail Mailbox\".\n    4. Click on the row of the e-mail address you are interested in.\n    5. Add you e-mail address in line \"Send copy to:\", separated with a comma \"`,`\" or comma and space from the others.\n    6. Click \"Save\". \n    7. Once the red-circled \"1\" disappears from the top area of the page, your change is successful. You may test it by sending an e-mail to that address, but note that other people will get it, too.\n\n* **If you are not a member of the management board:**\n\n    1. Ask @matthias (in Matrix chat or by direct message here on the platform) to add your e-mail address as forwarding target.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--6\">6. How to create an edgeryders.eu e-mail address</h2>\n\nWe can create e-mail addresses of the form `address@edgeryders.eu`. This is used for communications of the Edgeryders company (our social enterprise), but we can also provide such addresses for community projects which are in some way officially backed and supported by the Edgeryders social enterprise.\n\nHere's how to create such addresses.\n\n1. This needs server admin panel access. If you don't have the credentials for that, you should probably ask @matthias to do this task for you.\n\n2. Log in to the [ISPConfig panel](https://host.edgeryders.eu:8090/) for server administration (will be [this link](https://server.edgeryders.eu:8080/) some time after 2017-11 when the old link stops working).\n\n3. Go to \"Email \u2192 Email Mailbox\" and click \"Add new Mailbox\".\n\n4. Fill in the form:\n\n    * Put in the person's name (so we can know which addresses in the list are still needed).\n    * Configure the address to be `firstname@edgeryders.eu`.\n    * Set the password and copy it to your password manager or to tell the person whose address you are creating.\n    * Put the forwarding target address into \"Send copy to:\"\n    * Set \"Spam filter: \u2013 not enabled \u2013\".\n\n5. Click \"Save\".\n\nFor setting this new e-mail address up in an e-mail client to actually use it for sending and receiving e-mails, see: \"[Using edgeryders.eu e-mail addresses](/t/id/3365)\".\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Note:** Previously, we did set people up with e-mail forwarder addresses only (since we consider these personal addresses personal communication and did not want to be responsible for maintaining the security and integrity of these e-mails on our servers). However, sending from this as a \"From:\" address while using your own e-mail account is no longer practically possible due to new anti-spam measures in e-mail enforced by Google etc. (SPF, DKIM). So now everyone is getting a full e-mail account, but we still take no responsibility to back up these e-mails or keep them safe. (We do keep backups of course, and do our best to keep the server safe.)", "created_at": "2014-07-18 13:51:36", "updated_at": "2020-11-13 19:35:09.607974", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2804, "wiki": true, "reads": 38, "score": 129.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 85498, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 14530, "post_number": 42, "raw": "> It\u2019s a little bit like looking at how people treat the waiter or staff to understand whether this is a person I\u2019d like to be working with.\n\n(Side note: has anyone made a personnel decision based on this?

In Egderyders, we look at innovation and adaptation to modern life as differentiating forces: the young are not intrinsically different from anyone else, we behave differently from our parents because we live in a different world from the one they inhabited at our age. What about the private sphere? Have family constellations changed?\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>In your search for making a living and advancing in your work, you probably are not alone or also look to share your accomplishments with a significant other; maybe pass your knowledge on to your children. In this journey, how are you building a family of your own?</li>\n\n<li>what are you looking for in a rewarding family life? What, if anything, has changed compared to how you yourself were brought up, and how?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Good for you:</strong> We know this is a rather intimate subject, but see it as an opportunity to share your views with people that are confronting their own aspirations with other models, different pressures, and you\u2019ll learn we may be very much alike when it comes to values underpinning our private lives.  \n\n<strong>Good for everyone: </strong>Some of us are anxious about creating our own families before we fully stand on our feet. We\u2019d be happy to read what works for you and what doesn\u2019t, and learn from that!\n\n \n\n<h3><strong>Count me in!

If I disagree with someone, I'll just say it rather than beating about the bush. If someone thinks I'm talking bullshit, I am grateful for them to call bullshit on me, rather than politely nodding. Nobody ever learned anything by watching others nod politely. What I'm trying to say is that I cannot think properly unless I am allowed to call a spade a spade, and unless people around me do the same.\n\nAt most professional conferences and events, there is no incentive to speak the truth. You can glimpse some truth from most people; and you can get the occasional honest talk from a few. But in general everyone is supposed to tell everyone else how amazing they are. This is how the game is played. But this failure stuff is liberating. It creates a context in which the incentive to hustle is greatly reduced. So you get much healthier, better food for the collective thought.\n\nAt least, that's the theory.

Most of this information has a technological side. \n\nThe latest is this: the government of Romania has decided to \"transmit the entire database\" of clinical data treated by the health authorities, currently stewarded by the Ministry of Health, to the Ministry of Internal Affairs ([link](https://www.agerpres.ro/politica/2020/07/20/orban-toata-baza-de-date-a-ministerului-sanatatii-va-fi-transmisa-mai-pentru-verificarea-pacientilor-izolati-la-domiciliu--543216), Romanian). \n\nI know of another case where the Ministry of Internal Affairs ended up making health policy: Italy. As lockdown was decided, the government initially allowed daily exercise outdoors, done individually. This is, of course, consistent with the recommendations of any doctor: exercise is an essential component of health. However, the initial regulation was, in a few days, superseded by a new one, after the Minister of Internal Affairs complained that \"the only way to check people where compliant was to lock them inside at all times\". Doctors protested, but could not get the regulation to be overturned. \n\nIn general, when health care is entrusted to the police, and powerful digital surveillance tech is brought in... I don't know, it just smells bad to me.\n\nEDIT: some trust issues are indeed showing in the preliminary coding of the NGI Forward corpus.

Make a word a \"thing\" with an identity rather than remembering just its position, and you won't have problems finding it again, ever.

projects are built over time and through discussion.\u00a0 Isn't it likely that ideas will overlap or could be designed together, which may possibly thin the field enough to remove the need to vote on 'winners'?\n\nI guestion the need for a 'council of elders' to vet the community decisions.\u00a0 I get the impression that open inclusive projects and transparency are core values of most Edgeryders and wonder why it would be necessary to, at least to some degree, trample them now?\u00a0 Surely if 'wise' people are interested in engaging with Edgeryders they could do so by participating in the discussion.\u00a0 I'm interested in what people think is likely to be so offensive to funders which Edgeryders would not be able to weed out themselves through open discussion?\u00a0 Surely this is a big point of this project?\n\nA few months back I read <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/users/pietro-speroni-di-fenizio\">@Pietro Speroni di Fenizio</a>s' post about the <a

I am guessing, however, Ela is concerned with pre-market culture: stuff that embodies a lot of work and passion, but is not yet attracting even the modest demand that your books or my music does attract. When confronted with yet another indie band, is your gut reaction \"well, let's give it a go\" or \"man, you'd better be really good because we've heard it all\"?\n\nAre you familiar with dual labor supply models? Basically, the idea is that you divide your time not into two (labor and leisure), but in three: non-art labor, art labor and leisure. While I don't think these models are a particularly good idea, they are reacting to the uneasy feeling that everybody and their horse wants to be an artist: while we can all take turns at being artists and audience (artists do, after all, enjoy other people's art), this probably means that there is going to be a structural oversupply of art labor. And that seems to resonate with Ela's question of \"just how much culture can we take\".\n\nOnce a particular culture creator has made it to the \"cult\" status, then your analysis holds IMHO.

The situation you describe is an outcome in which, at least in Quebec, it's not happening. This could be looked at in various ways: for example, you could say that opengov did not happen because \"we the people\", through a democratic process, decided we don't want it enough to make the effort; or we could say it did nit happen because some people that dislike it or don't care find themselves in a position of greater power than other people who do want it.

If yes - can you tell us about this?** <br /> I could not seize a specific solution that I may apply, but I think several interesting suggestions were made.\nAlthough the event was rather short, I found interesting that it addressed the topic from the concrete experience of the presenters and that participants were asked to share their own experiences. \n <br /><br /> **Please, tell us about the best remote work experience you had up to this point:** <br /> Within a consortium of three companies, working on setting up a large scale online training platform for the European Commission, and producing 22 self-paced online training courses in 28 languages. From day 1, we decided to move most of our communications and activities related to the project on MS Teams, where we could write posts, simultaneusly work on documents and provide comments, hold meetings, etc.. This reduced the number of emails and centralised all the information, communications and documents in one online space. Most people learned quickly how to use this tool. <br /><br /> **What are the most common problems/challenges you face with remote work in your organisation?** <br /> 1) Remote work can be great, but personal presence for certain activities remains necessary or better than remote. Personal exchanges \"in presence\", even informal chats or quick feedback or information sharing, are often undervalued, but they really help create strength and cohesion in a team.\n2) Remote work requires some degree of IT skills that not all members of a team necessarily have, or are capable of developing. In any case, I see a challenge as many organisations tend to take for granted these IT skills. A serious capacity development effort should be undertaken by organisations to bridge the skills gap within their staff.\n3) If remote work is not deliberately chosen and planned, it may become messy. I see a high risk of multiplying the online tools an organisation uses, and considering the learning curve that each of them requires before it becomes an optimal tool for the specific purposes of an organisation, I see the risk of wasting time in a myriad of tools. \nResuming: as an organisation, I believe remote work should be deliberately chosen and accurately tested and planned, and such plan should include a capacity building/development component. Finally, balance between remote work and presential (traditional) work should be explored, depending on the type of work and organisation.\n <br /><br /> **On what kind of projects do you work?** <br /> Mainly training projects, usually related to development cooperation and humanitarian aid. <br /><br /> **How big is your organisation? How many collaborators do you work with remotely?** <br /> The organisation I work with counts around 130 staff members, spread across more than 10 offices, in 3 continents (Europe, Africa, Asia). <br /><br /> **What is your role within your organisation - do you have a mandate or budget to invest in improving how your organisation does remote, distributed work?** <br /> Within my organisation, I have a primary role, acquisition & project manager, but I also act as trainer and consultant, basic IT support, strategic adivisor... I don't have any mandate with a budget, but I initiated some internal projects, with the back up of the management, to improve remote work. Notably, the development of an internal database of projects managed by the organisation, and a push to move the management and communications of at least some projects to MS Teams. <br /><br /> **What would be a reasonable budget for your team/organisation to put into lowering risk of burnout of staff? ** <br />  <br /><br /> **What would engage you to make a financial contribution towards building an online training program on best practices for remote work and collaboration?** <br /> The possibility to involve the organisation I work with, as we are mainly a training provider and an enterprising partner.. <br /><br /> **Do you want to schedule a short phone call to explore potential collaborations with Edgeryders and or other participants in the event?** <br /> Yes <br /><br />", "created_at": "2020-12-07 14:51:58.407879", "updated_at": "2020-12-07 14:51:58.407879", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 741, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 66.8, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 5, 4934], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31058, "user_id": 2945, "topic_id": 4847, "post_number": 41, "raw": "Hi Nadia,\n\nI would love to help, I have a little organisation problem due to the still complicated situation at home, and have some trouble holding to deadlines so I don't wanna make promises I might not be able to keep.

We need that all over again right now [because there are larger-than-usual floods](http://www.recordnepal.com/live-blog/2017-nepal-floods-live-blog/). Not much we can do as Edgeryders (as we're mostly around Europe), but maybe this:\n\n[Sumana](https://www.facebook.com/sumanashrestha84) and her group of citizen crisis responders in Nepal have asked for the following maps:\n\n1. maps to figure out which areas are hardest hit (ideally recent satellite images)\n2. population density maps of the affected areas, for prioritization of relief\n3. incident map that shows which roads are blocked due to landslides\n\nHere are several proposals for our fellow responders in Nepal for suitable solutions:\n\n\n## 1. Self-made and ready-to-go crisis mapping\n\nOSM uMap is, to my knowledge, the best freely available crisis-mapping software to date. It can be installed on an own server, or used online for free. I (@matthias) already created a OSM uMap crisis-map for the 2017 Nepal floods here:\n\n> http://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/id_162690\n\nEveryone with that link can access and edit that map right away in order to add crisis-relevant information: waterlogged areas, roadblocks, population density as custom map layers and so on. Sumana may request @matthias to transfer ownership of the map to her or somebody of her group with an OpenStreetMap account ([create one here](https://www.openstreetmap.org/login)), to get admin access.\n\nThe map is however only a standard uMap map, with a few customizations. So you can as well create your own, as documented in topic \"[Creating a \u201cPoints of Interest\u201d map with open source tools](/t/id/9067)\", chapter \"3.1. Creating the POI map\".\n\n\n## 2. Post-disaster satellite imagery: create if needed\n\nOf course if there is free satellite imagery of the affected area, you'd use that (perhaps ask UNDP Nepal if they are aware of recent imagery). If there is none yet, there are options to task a satellite with capturing it.\n\nAccording to [this price comparison list](http://www.landinfo.com/satellite-imagery-pricing.html) of all the satellites available for that, the minimum price tag for such a job is 1600 USD for a 100 km\u00b2 area (the minimum size), at 50 cm/px resolution, using the GeoEye-1 satellite. This price assumes you can order it through a university or other academic institution, which gives a 30% discount.\n\n(This is based on web research only, I have no experience buying satellite imagery yet.)\n\n\n## 3. Asking for a SBTF side deployment\n\nThe Stand By Task Force is a well-known and potentially the best Internet group of volunteers who do crisis mapping very professionally, and have done it before. A local group will probably not meet their [activation criteria](http://www.standbytaskforce.org/for-humanitarian-agencies/our-activation-criteria/), but you can still get help from them by [asking for a side deployment](http://www.standbytaskforce.org/for-humanitarian-agencies/work-with-us-on-a-side-deployment/). This means they forward the request to their volunteers, who will decide on their own if they want to join the effort.\n\n\n## 4. Other experiences and best practices from the 2015 earthquake response\n\nPlease refer to the \"[How-To for Community-Driven Disaster Management](https://edgeryders.eu/t/id/4530)\", which I wrote with the experience of the 2015 Nepal earthquake response in mind.", "created_at": "2017-08-14 00:42:48.018059", "updated_at": "2018-09-27 00:06:06.242018", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 575, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 746.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3799], "is_private": false}, {"id": 84878, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 14530, "post_number": 11, "raw": "to all email adresses on the list? or just those on the platfrom?", "created_at": "2020-10-13 13:37:51.650203", "updated_at": "2020-10-13 13:38:05.141190", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 13, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 2.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [84876], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 86091, "user_id": 4968, "topic_id": 14724, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hi all, together with a colleague of mine (Filippo Celata, UniRoma1) I'm launching a call for a special issue of the journal Digital Geography and Society on \"Digital Platforms and Socio-spatial Justice in the (Post-) Pandemic City\u201d. \nMaybe of interest for somebody to contribute?\nDo drop me a message if in doubt!\n\n***\n\nCall for papers\n\n \n\n**Digital Platforms and Socio-spatial Justice in the (Post-)Pandemic City**\n\nSpecial issue of Digital Geography and Society\n\n \n\nGuest editors: Filippo Celata, Universit\u00e0 di Roma La Sapienza, and Chiara Certom\u00e0, Universit\u00e0 di Torino.\n\n \n\nDigital platforms are radically changing the way cities are shaped, inhabited, practised, imagined and governed. Urban areas are in fact ideal laboratories for experimenting platform-based approaches in a variety of domains: mobility (Uber, Waze), housing (Idealista, Zillow), tourism (Tripadvisor, Airbnb), food services (Yelp, Deliveroo), work (Upwork, MTurk), finance (Robinhood, Kabbage), education (remote learning platforms), urban planning and administration (IdeaScale, FixMyStreet, SafeLane), etc.; not to mention other biggest and more pervasive platforms, such as Amazon, Google, Facebook and social media. Despite their diversity, platforms often adopt similar logics based on a combination of crowdsourcing, datafication, algorithmic management, digital reputation, the exploitation of free or affective labour, network effects and surveillance (Srnicek, 2017; Van Dijck et al., 2018; Zuboff, 2019): a predatory and disruptive business model that extracts value from users (Mezzadra and Neilson, 2017) and their online/offline interactions, distributing such value unevenly among individuals, social groups, cities and different parts of a single city (Celata, Capineri and Romano, 2020).\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has temporarily paused some of those processes, \u00ad e.g. in the domains of mobility and tourism, \u00ad but it is heightening our addiction to digital services and shifting the threshold between what can be done online and offline in favour of the former, with consequences that scholars, observers and cities have only begun to explore (Certom\u00e0, 2020). \n\nThe Special Issue wishes to contribute to the burgeoning literature on the new urban geographies produced through and by the digital (Ash et al., 2018), focusing on how platforms reproduce or alter socio-spatial hierarchies and inequalities, and entangle categories of identity, race, gender, class, and location, particularly in light of the consequences of the Covid-19 and the changing organization of cities and urban life in the (post-)pandemic scenario. The aim is to explore how the ownership, management and use of digital (hard and soft) infrastructures interact with the physical, economic, and social life of the city, and what the outcomes are in terms of distributive and spatial justice. \n\nWe encourage the submission of research articles that critically engage with the \u2018platformization\u2019 of cites and its socio-spatial implications from a variety of perspectives: from the urban political economy of platform capitalism to cultural and critical enquiries of internet-mediated imaginaries and identities.\n\n \n\nWe seek papers that address (but are not limited) to the following themes:\n\n\u00b7 How digital platforms affect intra-urban inequalities, the social stratification of cities and inter-urban disparities (Richardson, 2020);\n\n\u00b7 How platforms disrupt traditional businesses and their unequal effects across cities and industries; \n\n\u00b7 How (competing) urban visions and ideologies are mobilized within and behind platforms (Graham et al., 2019);\n\n\u00b7 How the \u2018platformization\u2019 of urban life is entangled with issues of intersectionality and social positionality (Dy et al., 2017).\n\n\u00b7 How individuals adapt to and resist digital governmentality (T\u00f6rnberg and Uitermark, 2020) and the biopolitics of platforms (Coleman, 2016);\n\n\u00b7 How platforms challenge urban politics and sociopolitical practices in the city (Rossi, 2019);\n\n\u00b7 How the conditions (and struggles) for social and spatial justice change within the platform city (Shaw and Graham, 2017);\n\n\u00b7 What the actually existing (ethical, cooperative, state-led, etc.) alternatives are to corporate platforms (McLean, 2020);\n\n\u00b7 How public values are, or should be, imbued within the platforms to guarantee conditions of fairness, democratic control and accountability in the digital economy. \n\n \n\nInterested authors can follow this procedure:\n\n* send an abstract (max 300 words) to Filippo Celata ([filippo.celata@uniroma1.it](mailto:filippo.celata@uniroma1.it)) and Chiara Certom\u00e0 ([chiara.certoma@unito.it](mailto:chiara.certoma@unito.it)) by December 12th, 2020;\n* wait for approval (via email) and then submit all of the following: (1) the abstract + (2) cover letter + (3) title page in the Digital Geography and Society portal (https://www.editorialmanager.com/diggeo/default.aspx) by December 31st, 2020.

I've also worked with online radio stations to create content with them. Now this might not be much in the great scheme of things, but the way I see music is one that can educate people - the top 40 isn't the only music that is out there and to get people to listen to new and undiscovered artists is a beautiful thing. My creating mixes might even send people to independent labels where they go and buy a CD that enables that label to continue creating music that pushes boundaries and doesn't need big label money in order to create their art.\n\nFor me to continue to do this, musicians need to not attack me with copyright and such laws as what I am doing is getting their music out there. I remember actually getting a legal notice to desist my actions from a record label as I was in breach of copyright. I was using soundcloud as a host and the track was by Rammstein; a band that has earned more money than most could dream of, and their label served me with a legal notice. I make nothing from doing these mixes; I do them for mine and others enjoyment, and to help encourage further sales. Bands who are making music without the help of record label funding are usually the ones who are grateful to me for liking their music enough to put it in to a mix, yet the ones who are finding their business model collapsing, are the ones turning to the law to grab every last penny that they can.\n\nFor people to continue to promote music and art, they need to have a little faith that others aren't going to rip them off, or register their music under a creative commons license.

20 stories that include the \"Connection Made on Site\" code. Perfect, I think, for our purposes. I talked with Noemi this afternoon, and here is what we propose:\n\nSplit the stories 4 ways (5 each):\n\nI've gone through the stories and grouped them into categories based on topic, and assigned them to the people in the group who I think will be most interested/have the most expertise.\n\nFederico: 1,2,6 (Open Insulin), 20 (your meetup with Rune), and 13 (Trauma Tour, because it's a rich interesting one to try out the algo you and Guy came up with on)\n\nNoemi: 5, 7, 9, 10, 15 (refugee camps and community agriculture)\n\nEzio: 3, 12, 14, 16, 17 (design, policy)\n\nAmelia: 4, 8, 11, 18, 19 (disability and public health education)\n\nNext step: everyone read the stories with these questions in mind:\n\n1) What is the nature of the connection made? What kinds of people have connected, and around what particular topic/aspect of the story?\n\n2) What further action was taken? (e.g. Skype call, in person meeting, etc).\n\n3) What are the main themes of the story, and what kind of call to action is the orignal story making?\n\n4) Did the original storyteller ask for help of any kind to further their project? If so, what kind?\n\nComparatively:\n\n1) Across your stories, can you sense any kind of common theme? Topically? Structurally? In terms of the call to action?\n\n2) Did the stories follow any kind of pattern?\n\n3) Are there common users across the stories? Is there a particularly active user or group of users?\n\nUse your intuiton and take notes on your impressions of the stories. Think about them in relation to the larger Open Care dataset, and reflect upon whether they feel different in any meaningful way.\n\nNext, use GraphRyder to guide your further analysis of the stories.\n\n1) Go here: http://164.132.58.138:9000/#/dashboard/tagView\n\n2) Search for \"connection made on site\" in the tag view (NOT the tag view full) and find your story.\n\n3) Explore what other tags are used in your stories. Are there commonalities between stories? Within stories? The key question you want to answer: are there particular tags that are associated with connections made on site? If so, what are they?\n\n4) Play around and get creative! Any interesting observations from this angle?\n\nLet's have the call tomorrow and discuss any questions or comments we have on this starting methodology. Since Federico can't make it we can keep it short and really dive in to the proper discussion in a few weeks time once we've all had some time with our stories. Sound good?\n\n@Noemi @Ezio_Manzini @Federico_Monaco\u00a0 and @Alberto @Jason_Vallet @melancon for good measure :)\n\n", "created_at": "2017-07-18 21:42:28", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:03.443387", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 915, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 27.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12266, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 490, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>I hope OPENandChange application can help</b>\n\nI would love to see this collective bid help you figure out manufacturing at scale.

So, I would suggest trimming it to 10:00-18:00 (hey, it's Sunday!). Secondly, we probably need to add lunch. Is there a plan for that already? Thirdly, I would suggest adding in a walk during the day. There is a way to actually continue the workshop <em>while</em> walking, which is both healthy and fun. Is there a nice itinerary we could think of? (Max 1 hour, so about 3-4km.)\n\nWhile 30-45 minutes is probably good for tackling a project, it can get a bit unpredictable (in both directions: not having enough time to finish or finishing early). Personally, I strongly prefer a \"natural flow\", where we move things forward as fast as comfortable, but without artificial cut-off points. The only way to do this is to have participants agree that their project might not end up getting discussed and do a little exercise early on to determine in what sequence we will tackle the stories/projects. I think if this is communicated early on, it won't be a problem. Also keep in mind that everyone is pretty busy all the time, so it's not like you have to wait for your turn. What do you think?\n\nThe last issue has to do with number of participants. Again, I prefer a naturalistic approach: whoever comes is the right people.

As far as I understand from my sources in Poland, the decrease in organic land was due to changes in the national subsidies system for organic, after the decision of linking the organic certification to production. I mean, today in order to obtain the certification (and the EU subsidies) you have to cultivate something. This was not the case before - when people got subsidies just doing nothing, buying land and leaving it fallow.

The conversations can be video'd to harvest views and post them on the Edgeryder's platform ~ but only if you agree.\n\nThe idea is to get to know each other, cross-pollinate and humanise the Edgeryders experience and bring face-to-face conviviality to our on-line community.

They will probably participate with their energy company, Solidarity and Energy. As the consortium got close to complete, we noticed that international cooperation was one of the priorities. How would we address that? I got the idea to talk to UNDP.

This group:\n>\n> *   Participates in delivering WP4 on policy.\n>* Helps decline results in ways that are potentially more useful for neighborhood countries.\n> *  Helps disseminate any useful results \"back home\", in their respective spaces. \n>\n>The beauty of it is, you already know these people: they are the people the Innovation Hub already deals with.

[...] Fully agree- massive opportunity and something where can actually leverage the technical knowledge we have on the ground.\n\nSo, we are starting to build a \"pitch perfect\" consortium, for reasons that I can explain if you want, but we are also broadening our channel to access both C-KIC and UNDP, *and* trying to create value for everyone involved. Even if we lose, we are building goodwill that could result in new business. \n\nWe are also considering [another proposal](/t/13914) with some of the same partners \u2013 this was an idea that came from Messina. I intend to work on both, but let Marina lead the RezNet one, and Andreja lead the EarthOS one.

If we are happy with being \"good\" (outperforming randomness) at the aggregate level, we might need very little data. For example, in predicting the outcome of football matches, the simplest model \"the home team always wins\" does (a little) better than random. Hal Varian (Google's chief economist) a few years ago went on record saying \"if you have 99% correlation, who cares about causation\", or something like that. But this extra performance only applies to predicting a whole lot of football matches (the population), while being useless if you are trying to predict one match in particular. \n\nI think @katejsim worries that prejudices outperform randomness. *If you don't care about fairness and the rights of the individual*, you could indeed predict that the poorer neighbors would have more social welfare fraud than rich ones.

The nodes represent posts, radiating from topics, in turn radiating from subcategories (the different national fora and the workspace). Participants are represented as pawns who \"beam\" the conversation and create new nodes when they post. It's made with [Gource](https://gource.io) \u2013 I had to write a script that converts Edgeryders data in a format digestible by Gource.\n\nIt's a nice way to capture how the conversation developed. You can clearly see how the different fora in the various language germinate, develop, slow down, then suddenly speed up again (in the Fall of 2019, when the outreach effort intensified). The community fora are shown in blue,  the consortium's online workspace in gray, the POPREBEL-relevant discussion on Campfire in red, same as on this platform. Yellow nodes are not posts, but ethnographic annotations. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNcc_VLG2Ew\n\n\nSo, there are two things we might want to do it here, and here I ask for your help. \n\nFirst (mainly for @noemi), it would be interesting to check whether we can visually detect interesting phenomena. For example, a successful event results in a \"blooming\"; or a particularly interesting post generates a lot of replies; or people participating to more than one forum vs. staying in only one. \n\nThere is also an  interpretation for the clusters of yellow nodes: they point to semantically dense posts. If one post has 20 annotations, the software visualizes this as a \"ball\" of 20 yellow nodes connected to one single blue node. Looking at the whole conversation, one can see if the meaning is evenly distributed or not. \n\nEDIT: after the work explained [here](/t/13732/11), the text below has become outdated. Please ignore. \n\nAnd second, even with one day compressed in 0.1 seconds, this is still a very long video, over 8 minutes.

Location Scouting**\n\nSetting up in a rural environment: What are the pros and cons of Urban v.s. Rural environment.\n\n@woodbinehealth: Major question: why would you want to go urban - why rural? The timeline is different, slower in the rural areas - building communities in such environments is very different. The question is what are we trying to get from each space.\n\n@johncoate: What is the first cause, the point to demonstrate by setting it up in rural area? Is it to show that we can achieve self sufficiency? Or is it something else?\n\nAnother aspect: Once cultures are set within communities they are very difficult to change. How can change be brought about in a harmonious way? If it's rural, very important to link up with the local community from the start.\n\n@Nadia: Dimensions of time: people are all over the place, with commitments to different places, how do we have connected spaces with people living authentic lives rooted in community - how do these two work? For example Frank with Woodbine Collective in New York, or Winnie with the teaching space in Belgium, Nadia with roots in Sweden and East Africa.. How do we get this together, what kind of infrastructure do we need?\n\n@bachar_khattar: There needs to be an incentive, offering special kind of education for people at the same time is important motivation for bringing people together and investing time.\n\n@Nadia: Two kinds of spaces we are talking about: one is in rural, one is in urban environment. \n- First question: Two options: plug into something that is already there and connect to other things in the local community - or build something completely new\n- Second question: what can we offer? What is the thing we can offer to the surrounding culture, the environment, in terms of infrastructure - culture, learning and so on.. \n- Third question: how can we make it happen, from where we are - geographically.\n\n- @bachar_khattar: Talking about Lebanon as an example: there is a midway between being in the city and being in the mountains. If we can have an open space where anyone can work on any kind of project it welcomes people from both backgrounds.\n\n- @Nadia: how do we connect the hyperlocal / and small with the transnational and distant.

If, confronted with a disagreement, we all say \"My information is correct and well researched, yours is manipulated and distorted\" there is no way to ever converge. This would be very bad, as we know that [the evolutionary success of *homo sapiens* is driven by collaboration](https://books.google.it/books?hl=en&lr=&id=8XKYDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR9&dq=henrich+the+secret&ots=OBjxINIdgY&sig=gwU8ydIdP3htH0MsUEFcBQpOD3U#v=onepage&q=henrich%20the%20secret&f=false) at ever larger scales, and there is no collaboration without a shared understanding. \n\nHence \"trust the science\": there is a process for falsifying scientific statements that has historically worked well enough, in the long run. In the long run, I am sure the COVID controversy will be put to rest, and we will know the hows and the whys. Unfortunately, we are now not in the long run, and we must live with the hasty preprints and the retractions, the academic posturing, the  ineffective procurement (here are the [UK](https://www.fr24news.com/a/2020/07/coronavirus-recall-of-defective-masks-in-nursing-homes-and-general-practitioners-uk-news.html), and the [Dutch](https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-netherlands-recalls-defective-masks-bought-from-china/a-52949216) govts buying millions of defective masks, and don't get me started on Belgium), the (yes, definitely) corrupt companies out to make a quick buck. During all this, different papers are saying different things. This is a feature of science, not a bug. Like Ed Yong, one of my favorite biology writers, remarked:\n\n\n> This is how science actually works. It\u2019s less the parade of decisive blockbuster discoveries that the press often portrays, and more a slow, erratic stumble toward ever less uncertainty. \u201cOur understanding oscillates at first, but converges on an answer,\u201d says Natalie Dean, a statistician at the University of Florida. \u201cThat\u2019s the normal scientific process, but it looks jarring to people who aren\u2019t used to it.\u201d ([source](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/pandemic-confusing-uncertainty/610819/))\n\nThis is not what we'd like to hear, but I believe it to a big part of the truth.", "created_at": "2020-10-20 05:03:57.541667", "updated_at": "2020-10-20 05:31:28.526503", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 454, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 22.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 2, "quotes_posts": [85066, 85310], "is_reply_to": [85066, 85310], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 39914, "user_id": 3904, "topic_id": 7755, "post_number": 19, "raw": "Thanks so much @lucy and @unknown_author for the connection - these are all super useful for getting a lay of the land.

We would like to discuss and reflect on the intersection between precarious labour conditions and the neoliberal surge on higher education in the last two decades. The best we can do is to come together and learn from each other in order to arrive at a better analysis of the various challenges faced. We would like to exchange experiences and knowledges over struggles for academic freedoms and labour conditions in different contexts. We would like to take the opportunity to learn, exchange and collaborate with/through the framework of critical learning, decent labor and networks of sharing and caring. All participants are invited to zoom in to position the question of labour in academia within broader societal struggles in their own contexts and zoom out to link it up to related struggles in other geographies. As the first step towards concrete action in solidarity, participants are invited to reflect on the following 2 questions: \n\n1.  What are the structural agencies, practices and grammars involved in the precaritization of knowledge workers in the last two decades? \n\n2. What are the realities and calculated logics of diversity, of structural inequalities and possibly discrimination?\n\n3. How can we collaborate with intermediary policy makers for boosting up critical learning and better conditions in higher education setting? \n\n# Who is participating?\n\nThis list will be updated continuously with the people who are invited and confirm attendance.\n\n* Dissent in Higher Ed group reps from France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands and the UK\n* Learning and teaching groups in edgeryders community...\n* NGA-Wiss (Decent Labor in Academia Network in Germany) \n* ArteZ initiative on Crisis Ed Critical Ed - see link below for details\n* Union reps from Turkey, UK and the US\n* Policy makers/agents in the EU, UNESCO...\n\n![Session%20preparations|690x388](upload://v7y2gH4uUpnl7QrltNVZeRvg2tY.jpeg) \n\n# Format and practical information\n\nDepending on interest, this could be a series of online meetings to get prepared. Then a moderated discussion with speakers from diff initiatives/institutions/responsibilities that could address the issue from diverse perspectives. This would rather be an online workshop model that brings together knowledge and experience to form collaborations and multiply impact. \n\n* **An online meeting.**  You register in advance to reserve your spot, and you will receive a link and password to join (this will be sent the day before the event): [Registrations are open here](https://covid19-summit.netlify.app/).\n* **A moderated discussion.** A moderator will give the floor to people who want to contribute something. Some have already volunteered (see list above, updated continuously). If you want to share your point of view, use the call\u2019s chat to let us know, and the moderator will give you the floor. If you have a question to ask the speaker, ask it in the chat (better) or let us know you want to ask a question. Questions are taken before we move on to the next speaker.\n* **We commit to doing a proper writeup of the result**  (aka \u201cdocumentation, or it didn\u2019t happen\u201d). Edgeryders also deploys its team of ethnographers for participant observation and note-taking.\n* **Everyone welcome.** Below there is a list of the people who have agreed to participate. If you are coming too, we are happy to put you on it. If you prefer not to be on the list, that\u2019s OK too.\n* **Please note we aim to publish the content of the conversation as public knowledge, available to activist and scholars.** However, this will happen through writeups by people in Edgeryders. While we will record the event, participants are welcome to sign up under aliases and keep their video shut off. Also, the writeups will not mention any names.\n\n# Preparation\n\nAhead of the event, take some time to go through the materials below. We summarize them and link to the full resource:\n\n1.

It turns out a bug in the Drupal module let users created _after_ the funnel deployment date (2016-07-08)  bypass the funnel; it stores the account creation date as the default value of the consent validation date. This did not show up in testing because, of course, we tested with accounts created before that date. A second bug (but this time in Drupal core) seems to have overwritten the consent validation date for some of the user accounts created before the deployment date.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n1. We ported the consent funnel to the new platform (fixing the bug!), and in fact extended it to all Edgeryders, not just to opencare. We tested carefully (it works) and keep monitoring it. New participants or those returning to the opencare discussion after porting to the new platform will have to go through the funnel, and so solve the problem for themselves. On Monday August 14th (in the first three weeks after deployment), 68 users had completed the consent funnel. \n1. After the October festival, we will generate a list of participants that have not gone through the consent funnel. We will contact them one by one, and give them a link whereby they can go through the funnel and register their consent, even without a need to post further. @noemi will be responsible for this action.  \n\nMarco: I guess this needs to go through our ethical advisors.

Normally I like to map node size in the codes co-occurrences graph to the number of occurrences (without \"co-\").

But I am not sure how to interpret those pure-mathematical properties in terms of this graph in particular. If you are thinking of a communication network (internet servers, or a power grid), robustness to random/targeted removal of nodes has a clear interpretation in terms of a continued service.

I was thinking about it, and I am not sure that it is really that prominent. I think that this is one of the few quite general codes that also have more child codes. Same it would be with \"politics\" if we consistently child all relevant codes to it or to its children (such as \"politicians\").\n\nIf I understand correctly, what does the network visualization shows, I think we should systematically go through all our codes and hierarchize them in the back-end. Many codes have a lower density than 5 and therefore they won't be visible in the visualization. However, they are reflecting some area, they are aspects of some phenomenon. \nHowever, there should be some logic in the hierarchization, but I am still unsure how this should be done. Or I do not feel competent to do that. E.g. do we want to child \"ideology\" to \"politics\" (as it is now) or should they be separate? Or emotions, do we want to put them together under one parent code? Or should we do hierarchies (and group) codes such as: now and then, nostalgia, technological development, automation, barriers to change, breaking from tradition, all the economic topics, EU funds, etc. Also, **Church** and/or religion is still not hierachized.\n\nTalking about code politics and ideologies, there are codes that should be made children of one of that. **Politics**:voting, pluralism, political (...), populism (or this to ideologies?); **Ideologies**: authoritarianism, neocolonialism, neoliberalism, all anti-*.\nAlso, I am not sure about Islamophobia, 'patriotism'.\nIf you think this is correct, I can child-parent these codes or you can do it.\nI have created the code **chief executive** for Czech and Polish top politicians as agreed. I have added all politicians to the politicians-code (e.g. Merkel, Orban, Salvini, Sanders, Putin). I have been thinking about creating also a category **populist politicians** as a specific, project relevant code.This would mean either to make copies of politicians who are also populists. Or abandon the code chief executive politicians and have only code politicians and it's child populist politicians. What do you think?\n\nI have done some parenting-childing of **media** (+ online / social media), also to **labour**. I will create a code **ecology** to subordinate recycling, wasting, natural environment and pollution.\n\nI will create code **urbanisation** and subordinate codes such as: urban development, urban landscape, big cities, non-residential development, small town, housing policy, improving places.

Naturally the funding problem is there but we do crowd-funding and apply for different projects. ( as we can\u2019t get money from our work we don\u2019t perform in theatres or sell tickets ) I am the only one in the team working full-time as the others have other jobs. But anyways we are working and alwyas have projects.\n\n* We don\u2019t have problems with permits, all the authorities are cooperative with us as we are just a bunch or clowns or artists who perform some funny plays\n\n* I think what can connect us toegther is to listen and share our stories. Since storytelling is the base of my work, this helps to open up for other people; this helps the storyteller receiver and connector ( us performing ) we can see that it ( stories with laughter ) helps; one can see the different atmosphere created at the time of the plays and even the people are always pleased and wants us to come back again.\n\n* I can see that the world is unfair, but I can see also a lot of kindhearted people doing a lot of great things. For example in the balkans one can see 500 people left in the woods, it takes one and a half hour to reach their place, because they don\u2019t want to be identified there as they will be stuck this way in serbia, this poltical situation besides wars and destruction is very horrible, but there are also their neighbors in the town nearby who walk everyday for one and a half hours just to deliver food to these people. And I hope that these people run the world not the current politicians, I know it is an idealistic dream, but I can see a lot of love hidden within the hatred and destruction\n\n* For lebanon, I don\u2019t have any solution. I am at a stage where I can\u2019t see any big solution to our problems, what I do is to continue doing what I do, continue going to the streets performing, continue saying no, become myself a responsible citizen for now.\n---\n\n\n[text-direction=rtl]\n\n* \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0636\u0644\u0629 \u0646\u0628\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0627\u0647 \u0647\u0649 \u0643\u064a\u0641

I am no expert (but some here are: for example @mstn, @elf_pavlik,  @napo and @simonecortesi). I have never studied this in detail. But:\n\n* I don't understand what you mean by \"data analysis cannot  be implemented in OSM\".\n* As for computing accessible itineraries; of course you are right that this is not done in OSM itself. The whole idea of OSM (or Google Maps), as far as I understand it, is that it provides the data for _other people_ to build applications on top of. The OSM wiki has several routing examples optimised by different needs (for example [this one](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Routing#Bicycle) for cyclists).\n* Any data you collect that do not meet the OSM stringent requirements, like the 10 simple questions, can be stored on your own server and \"mixed\" with map data on the fly via API calls. \n\nSo, it seems that (in theory) you could build an added value application on top of OSM as of Google. The difference is that Google data are not plastic the way OSM data are: any edit to the Google database you have to ask for, then wait and hope, whereas in OSM you can just go ahead and make the edit yourself. This has big implications in terms of building community and awareness. For example, you can organise [mapping parties](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mapping_parties). \n\nBesides this technical issue, you might enjoy the work that the City of Milan is doing in a similar vein: trying to build cheap, simple solutions for shopkeepers to make their shops wheelchair accessible.

But I was sure that is not the WHOLE reality.\n\nMy India was different. I saw smiling people on the street, while the country still has a lot of challenges: diseases, terror, poverty and some other difficulties. However, India was full of energy and ready to show to the entire world that they want to play a major role.\n\nThe positive attitude in the Indian culture was like a storm for me. I realize that we have plenty of positive exemplas and arguments for Romania. I realize that almost everything is connected with attitude, the Positive attitude.\n\nIt was simple.

all connected to the courage to chose your own way in life. This is the kind of courage I admire most at a person.\n\n<em>\u201c I made a decision 7 years ago to leave an institutional job so that I could live more freely and yet also more closely to my family. I like working from home, with my partner and child involved in what I do. \u201c</em>\n\nThis is also my ideal way of living and working, so I totally agree and support this choice.\n\n<em>\u201cWe eat three meals a day together. We can eat healthy food that we like. We can organise our day and our space as we like.\u00a0\u201c</em>\n\nIt\u2019s a basic human right to be allowed to eat what you like. Unfortunately, too many times, the people at \u201cthe office\u201d kind of push you to consume unhealthy food. Also, not having the right to organize your time and space as you like, \u00a0sounds to me like \u201cprison\u201d. This is why I appreciate Bridget\u2019s choice.\n\n<em>Some people ask why we only have one child. It doesn't seem normal. But, I feel it's responsible in a crowded planet to have no more than one (or maybe two) children. And I'm glad that it's more acceptable to choose to be childless too. </em>\n\nI think the decision to have only one child is indeed a responsible decision, as we are already too many people on this planet fighting for food. Being childless is also a good option, as if one doesn\u2019t have enough emotional resources to be a parent, why condemn a new soul to a stressful educational system and exhausting job ?\n\n<em>\u201cI get a little frustrated with the conventional media assuming that there are women's roles and men's roles, and clearly delineated issues associated with those roles. Apart from the actual bearing of a child, everything else is interchangeable. My (male) partner has always played an active nurturing role, with childcare and home. All the tasks of making a thriving life are equal. \u201c</em>\n\nI am also a convinced supporter of gender equality and hate conventional gender roles. The perfect family is indeed a family where both partners play , by turns, the roles of Mom and Dad.\n\n<em>We have to be open to change and try not to judge other people for their choices.\u00a0</em>\n\nI can\u2019t agree more : people should be free to make their own decisions and it\u2019s none of our business to comment or criticize these choices.\n\nAll in all, a great and inspiring family story I enjoyed reading.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-11 10:21:00", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 09:10:08.893617", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 496, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 81354, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 14204, "post_number": 6, "raw": "Good idea.

You forget the social aspects Elf, that people have to want and be able to achieve the incremental steps involved. If they just add complexity and work without resulting in immediate benefits<em> as perceived by all the stakeholders at any given time</em>, then it does not matter what rules you try to impose top down.\n\nI read some parts of this discussion as some people pushing for something which requires everyone on board to agree when some of those concerned say no. Which means it is likely you will get a couple of hours thrown into something which will be half baked, i.e. taking time away from the many other things unMonasterians are supposed to be doing. E.g. with their individual projects. In this case I think it is better to shelve the discussion until a more appropriate time/setting where people have agreed to try this approach, committed to get the work required done (i.e. finish what is started) and give it an honest try over a long enough period of time. IMHO we do not have this time at the moment. Obviously everyone is free to decide for themselves.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-05-21 09:03:41", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:47.258890", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 248, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [30114], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 39617, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 7677, "post_number": 5, "raw": "There's only one @matthias :smile:", "created_at": "2017-11-20 23:48:02.639703", "updated_at": "2017-11-20 23:48:02.639703", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 6, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 38.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 87364, "user_id": 6339, "topic_id": 14626, "post_number": 10, "raw": "[quote=\"amelia, post:9, topic:14626\"]\nAt this point, I vote we just delete them.\n[/quote]\n\nI have deleted some of the codes that were only with quotes from the Serbian forum.

This should be relatively simple to implement, as there are Matrix SDKs for Javascript and we really only need to implement a client. The Matrix server (called Synapse) would live on matrix.edgeryders.eu or similar, and no end user would ever need to know or visit that URL.\n\nWe would not get the full functionality of the Riot Matrix client (which is their most advanced one). In particular, it may be too difficult to implement WebRTC (voice and video calls). Even so, anyone intended to use voice or video calls can use the (externally hosted) Riot client, an Android or iOS app for Matrix, or another client.\n\nMy main reason for this turnaround is however that it avoids the need for login integration between the Riot Matrix client on (say) riot.edgeryders.eu and edgeryders.eu. Login integration is a notorious mess, as it either involved a third-party single sign-on service that breaks often (Persona, OpenID, \u2026) or messing around with hashing methods, API calls or multiple database connections, all of which reduces the reusability of our code for others. So, no to login integrations, as a principle. Every normal user will only need a single edgeryders.eu account to participate in all of Edgeryders. Every company or project team member will need multiple accounts (Edgesense, Open Ethnographer, OpenProject, whatnot) but all auxiliary accounts would be set to \"never expire the login\", so would not cause inconvenience after the initial sign-up.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-12 00:10:25", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:47.767268", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 290, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 6.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [14432], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 86649, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 14766, "post_number": 20, "raw": "[quote=\"antonekker, post:17, topic:14766\"]\nThese projects were targeted at specific neighborhoods that were considered \u2018problem districts\u2019.\n[/quote]\n\nHere I have two further questions (sorry, Anton!). \n\n1.

According to some observers, the American police searches mostly black young men, which results in black young men accounting for a disproportionately high number of positive searches (and also negative ones). Was this what worried the courts? Solution: unleash SyRI on randomly chosen citizens.\n\n[quote=\"antonekker, post:17, topic:14766\"]\nThe use of SyRI was insufficiently transparent and verifiable.

We use a piece of paper and a smartphone that recognizes the paper and puts on it a 3d object .\nWe will be using this technology to project a small 3d animation with voice that reads the story . the paper we will be using will be the reading books used in school education in tunisia .\nWith animation on the words something like karaoke , the kids will be able to read the stories , learn and have fun.In addition to this , the app will have special animation in words and the stories to suit the needs of special kids , like the dyslexique ones .\nThat was the reading feature , also the app will have a game zone that will help children play to learn basic things like numbers and letters but this time using another technology that helps bring 3d objects in the real word without using the paper , something like pokemon go and lots of other features to help improve the imagination of the children \n \n \nNow we are a team of four engineers:\n\nMyself, I am a book lover , a game player . I am active in the social life as a vice president in the junior chamber international.

struggle to have a good life. Some of the readers might think that being \"Rich\" is only in accordance with wealth and financial resources but it's not. It's all about an environment that includes good education, health, and wealth that enables you to have a free time to do whatever you're willing to do. What I am aiming to contribute in achieving in my life is the principle of Amartya Sen's approach of capabilities and development. That we need to let people have equal opportunities of education and health care that allows them all to achieve what they are dreaming.\n\nThe first way to reduce inequality is to provide high-quality semi-equal education. Each of us has a part of its time and effort specialized for charity and good whether its volunteer or donating part of the money and other ways. What I am urging and advise people to do is not to help a poor person they know by giving him some money. Our priority needs to build or develop a school surrounded. I do not say that we neglect the poor man, but to give priority to projects that ensure that the poor will not remain poor. If we provide better education opportunities for the poor that will result in a better opportunity for them that provide them a better income, which prompts them from the stage of poverty and guarantees them a decent life.\n\nNot only will our charitable efforts towards education improve the economic aspects. But also, social aspects. We find that education includes the elimination of harmful social phenomena such as terrorism, racism, sexual harassment, and corruption. Not only that but also allows corrupted rich people to exploit them and sustains their corruption that destroys and steal society's resources. One form of such exploitations is terrorism. The best evidence to highlight it is according to the latest UN statistic that about 40% of those who join terrorist groups is because of poverty.\n\nThat's why I always advise and towards my efforts to Education.", "created_at": "2017-08-22 18:21:45.245145", "updated_at": "2017-09-05 20:03:48.835656", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 652, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 73.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3729, 3791], "is_private": false}, {"id": 34667, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 6771, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Hello and welcome Khaled,\n\nI'm reading you with interest. The first questions, as it always does for me, is how to begin and how to sustain it. One of the reasons why those at the bottom end of the wealth ladder are not afforded an education is because somehow there are never enough the resources to put into this. So an important part of the work is figuring out how the education process can be sustained to provide continuity.\n\nAnother part of the equation is the people actually driving the education - the teachers/ stewards of the education process. In my experience, people who are most likely to care enough to work on building a school for the underpriveledged will themselves not be well off and require some kind of support. \n\n @susa has first hand experience from working with a school in Nairobi, where the students and parents have to raise money to keep it going.

In recent years, as I watched global change rise, I became increasingly interested in the ethical implications of geosciences. We call it geoethics.\n\nWhat does it mean to steward Earth systems? How do we, as individuals and societies, can even assume stewardship on systems apparently so much larger, and definitely so much older than ourselves? In the extreme, how is our ongoing practice of de-facto geo-engineering ethical? In which circumstances, and why?\n\nThis year, like everyone else, I stayed at home and watched the rising tide of the COVID-19 pandemic. And it occurred to me that pandemics, too, call on us to put together an ethical frame of reference at a much larger scale than that of the individual. With infectious diseases, my health is not just my own: it becomes a factor in yours, too. This gave me new, interesting questions: what does geoethics have to say about ethical behavior in a pandemic? Vice versa, how do actual decisions made (ethically) during the actual COVD-19 pandemic reflect on the work of geoethicists?\n\nWith these questions in mind, I have started working on a new subject, drafting my thoughts and discussing with friends, peers and strangers.\n\nWhat follows below sketches some elements of my thinking so far. ***If you have feedback or ideas to contribute, I will be duly grateful.**\n\n[TrailerGeoPandemic_V.2_20Jun01.pdf|attachment](upload://sJOXQ20iEGa16q9be4mX8OBUkI2.pdf) (303.6 KB)", "created_at": "2020-06-02 21:01:52.249994", "updated_at": "2020-06-03 08:58:03.460088", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 246, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 371.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 78402, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 13807, "post_number": 1, "raw": "I have used [Gource](https://gource.io) plus some custom code of my own to produce an animated visualization of how the debate evolved on this platform. \n\n![Screenshot 2020-07-08 at 13.28.02|690x388](upload://8sgVVuYoeHsk9pVsRNi2AcZu7Ai.jpeg) \n\nPosts (about 2,800 so far) are visualized as dots, arranged in a tree: the root is Edgeryders itself, the branches are the categories and the sub-categories.

Sub-branches are topics and the leaves individual posts. Posts can be replies to other posts, so occasionally you can see long chains of posts.

The other one is the [Events](#ioh:events) category \u2013 mostly what came out of our various meetings.

It is usually far better to accomplish that small piece because we rarely know the answers to the larger puzzle in advance.\n\nDesigning monolithic five-year project plans never works.\n\nReminds me a bit of one of those time management books I read years ago that said \"don't say you'll clean the garage\" when, instead, you should break down the larger project into manageable and necessary tasks such as \"buy trashbags\" and \"find the broom.\"\n\nActing incrementally is important, in my view, to acknowledge with humility, as you suggest, that we don't have all the answers upfront and, above all, to motivate and energize those doing the work by showing concrete results in a short time frame.\" (Beth Noveck)\n\n<a href=\"http://%22I%20enjoyed%20your%20post.%20%20%20You%20make%20an%20important%20point%20that%20moving%20quickly%20doesn%27t%20demand%20certainty.%20In%20fact,%20programmers%20who%20practice%20agile%20programming%20know%20far%20better%20that%20making%20progress%20requires%20trying,%20assessing,%20and%20trying%20again%20in%20stages,%20as%20you%20suggest.%20%20%20While%20not%20all%20projects%20take%2090%20or%20120%20days,%20there%20is%20always%20some%20piece%20of%20the%20project%20that%20can%20be%20accomplished%20in%20that%20time%20frame.%20It%20is%20usually%20far%20better%20to%20accomplish%20that%20small%20piece%20because%20we%20rarely%20know%20the%20answers%20to%20the%20larger%20puzzle%20in%20advance.%20%20%20Designing%20monolithic%20five-year%20project%20plans%20never%20works.%20%20%20Reminds%20me%20a%20bit%20of%20one%20of%20those%20time%20management%20books%20I%20read%20years%20ago%20that%20said%20%22don%27t%20say%20you%27ll%20clean%20the%20garage%22%20when,%20instead,%20you%20should%20break%20down%20the%20larger%20project%20into%20manageable%20and%20necessary%20tasks%20such%20as%20%22buy%20trashbags%22%20and%20%22find%20the%20broom.%22%20%20%20Acting%20incrementally%20is%20important,%20in%20my%20view,%20to%20acknowledge%20with%20humility,%20as%20you%20suggest,%20that%20we%20don%27t%20have%20all%20the%20answers%20upfront%20and,%20above%20all,%20to%20motivate%20and%20energize%20those%20doing%20the%20work%20by%20showing%20concrete%20results%20in%20a%20short%20time%20frame.%22%20%28Beth%20Noveck%29%20%20%20You%20can%20see%20all%20comments%20on%20this%20post%20here:%20%20http://govinthelab.com/hesitation/#comments\">http://govinthelab.com/hesitation/#comments</a>\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-11 17:40:57", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:15.283463", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 525, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 86672, "user_id": 6899, "topic_id": 14766, "post_number": 42, "raw": "True, but 'existing non-algorithmic systems' basically depend on human decisions.

I suggest you rewrite it, or better still write a more \"human centered\" account of your story in a comment to this one.\n\nFor me, the seed is this:\n\n<blockquote>From February to September 2011, I knocked at every door of the government of Quebec. We also approached several delegations of the Association des parlementaires de la Francophonie. Quebec\u2019s final answer (on September 1st) was: \"There are no solutions. There is nothing at the government of Quebec that allows the launch of this project.\" Rejection of the project was also based on this answer:\" This project does not meet entrepreneurship criteria.\"20 days later (on September 20, 2011), forty-six UN countries engaged in the Open Government Partnership. The main Francophonie countries are absent from this partnership: France, Belgium, Switzerland, Luxembourg (and Quebec).</blockquote>There is a lot missing here. Why do you even care about this stuff? How did you come up with this grand international Francophone vision of open government? If you want to work with open gov, is it not easier (and hard enough!) to do it in Toronto, or even in Obama's America? How did you build the competences to even be in the debate? Who encouraged you to take the risk?\n\nAlso: I know John Moore, but most Edgeryders have never heard of him. So, when you introduce a new character in the story (such as him)\u00a0 you should devote half a line to explain who he or she is, to help people follow you!\n\n", "created_at": "2011-11-18 15:21:26", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:46.712972", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 282, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 45339, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 8702, "post_number": 7, "raw": "Just using FreeAgent seems less overhead, yes. But we need to make it work for the cases where multiple people make payments, preventing these \"double payment\" issues that happen from time to time.\n\nSo, there has to be a place for people to see what has been paid and what not. For expenses, it can't be FreeAgent since the \"Expenses\" page only reflects payments once the bank transactions have been imported and reconciled. Which we don't do immediately. (For bills, on the other hand, there is a good solution: we'd use the \"Comments\" field of bills for that, starting it with (for example) \"PAID 2018-06-04 by Noemi\". It's visible in the [Bills overview list](https://edgeryders.freeagent.com/bills), so quite clear.)\n\nPossible solutions include:\n\n1. Designate only one person at a time who is in control of payments. But that's against being an agile organization where people can help each other out easily \u2026 .\n\n* Create a rule that everyone who makes payments has to import and reconcile the bank statements first. But that will fail when bank transactions have been queued but not booked yet because it's outside bank business hours.\n\n* Create an easily accessible task list on Dynalist with tasks for every week (\"Process bill and expense payment tasks for week \u2026 .\").

My project <a href=\"http://www.goldprodukt.de/individualized/\">isopt</a> (parametric porcelain) is an experiment about exactly this process of offering an open system to the client where they can not only choose from options but really interact with the design and shape of the object. It would then be 3D printed via lasersintering and be finished by a local ceramic workshop where it could be picked up by the client. So no costs for transport or storage but a personalized product the creator will always have a special relationship to. I would LOVE to do more of those projects and I have tried very hard to sell this concept to the conservative porcelain companies in Germany but they are too afraid to go new ways (this was in 2008/09). The 3D printing technology is improving so rapidly in terms of refining the layerthickness, visual quality, speed of printing and even multi material in one printing process that in my opinion it will push us to a democratized and self sustainable\u00a0production which will eventually be independent from the global players.

Here in Amsterdam we struggle with the idea of social value. I think that probably the best way to solve it, is to get more people involved in day to day decision making. For example by establishing online methods for citizen participation and giving them a clear view in community budget by methods like Open Spending. Getting a permanent insight in what constituents find important and where they think the community budget should be spend on at the moment of decision making itself \u00a0is very important in this respect. What we general do in western societies is having elections every 4 or 6 years and making programs for those periods of time. And then the power of constituents is handed over to Assemblees, Councils to fill in the details, adjust plans when things get changed and so on. Nowadays, with the possibilities of online networks, we can do better than that. I think that one of the pitfalls of quantifiying social value is that we will establish a different kind of measurement but will not redesign the decision making proces iself. I.e. measuring the social value of something at one certain point in time but having no tools to adjust to changes in the way society revalues thing.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-10 07:06:53", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:09.459680", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 236, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 79651, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 13785, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Greetings @how  I'm sorry I missed this the first time around.

Looking forward to meeting you in person.\u00a0\n\nI find it difficult to make anything out of descriptive statistics like these. I suggest a slightly different approach.\n\nWe should start by asking ourselves: what do we want to happen? What does success look like for Edgeryders? In the world of Google Analytics, this is done by \"goals\". Back in the day, we created several goals: create a node, create a comment, signup, visit at least 4 pages etc. At that point,\u00a0we can assess our performance with respect to the goals.\n\nOf course, there are complications. I have not looked into this for a long time, but I can see at least two:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Different parts of the website can and do have different functions, therefore different goals. The blog and the company site (https://edgeryders.eu/company/home etc.) are basically read only stuff. We want people to be aware of them \u00a0and think we are cool, and they should hire us. The challenge response and project groups are interactive: what matters there is content creation.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>GA counts hits. So, a \"goal\" can only be defined in terms of visiting pages.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nAnother advanced function of analytics would be to help define our social media strategy.

But I am not much interested in discussing a hypothetical ideal academia in the world as it ought to be, because I am too busy working within the constraints the world as it is.

Poprzedni lokatorzy wykupili to mieszkanie od gminy za 46 tys. a ja odkupi\u0142am od nich za ok. 100 tys. - ok. za 52,9 m.kw. Nie sta\u0107 by mnie by\u0142o na najem: op\u0142acenie stancji i medi\u00f3w, nie da\u0142abym rady, a tak sp\u0142acam kredyt i ju\u017c jest moje. Mam raty miesi\u0119cznie 673 z\u0142. Mieszkanie jest bezczynszowe. Mam do tego podstawowe wydatki: chemia, ubrania. A jak brakuje, to prosz\u0119 siostr\u0119 o pomoc, kt\u00f3ra mo\u017ce mi pom\u00f3c. Moja mama ma emerytur\u0119, ale nie bior\u0119 od niej pieni\u0119dzy. Do niczego si\u0119 nie dok\u0142ada.\n\nJak m\u00f3j m\u0105\u017c zmar\u0142, dzieci ko\u0144czy\u0142y 18 i 16 lat. Syn uczy\u0142 si\u0119 i doje\u017cd\u017ca\u0142 do szko\u0142y, c\u00f3rka tak samo. Musia\u0142am da\u0107 rad\u0119. Pami\u0119tam, \u017ce synowi brakowa\u0142o 10 gr do autobusu, to m\u00f3wi\u0119: dziecko id\u017a do ta\u0144szego. Potem wyjecha\u0142 do Londynu, bo naprawd\u0119 by\u0142o krucho. I pomaga\u0142 mi. Mia\u0142am przer\u00f3\u017cne my\u015bli. Chcia\u0142am si\u0119 przyj\u0105\u0107 do szpitala w innym mie\u015bcie, bo by\u0142oby l\u017cej, ale zarobki na takim samym poziomie. Lepiej, \u017ce by\u0142yby noce, bo noce s\u0105 lepiej p\u0142atne. Dzie\u0144 by\u0142by wolny, wi\u0119c mo\u017cna by by\u0142o dorobi\u0107 wi\u0119cej. Na kuchni jest ci\u0119\u017cko: gor\u0105co, ci\u0119\u017ckie gary, trzeba d\u017awiga\u0107. Zaw\u00f3d kucharza jest ci\u0119\u017cki i niewdzi\u0119czny. Ale s\u0105 \u201etrzynastki\u201d. Popo\u0142udni\u00f3wki ju\u017c nam zabrali, czyli praca od 16:00 do 19:00 \u2013 inaczej p\u0142acone \u2013 lepiej. Pracuj\u0119 po 12 godzin. S\u0105 \u201e\u00f3semki\u201d - osiem godzin, 4-5 razy w miesi\u0105cu, a reszta \u201edwunastki\u201d, bo inaczej nie obstawi grafiku. Jest za ma\u0142o ludzi. W DPS jest 80 os\u00f3b i sama musz\u0119 zrobi\u0107 kolacj\u0119. My\u015bl\u0119, \u017ce to nie jest zgodne z prawem ani z BHP ( *przyp.: Bezpiecze\u0144stwo i Higiena Pracy* ). Og\u0142aszamy, ale nikt nie chce przyj\u015b\u0107 do pracy za te pieni\u0105dze. To jest odpowiedzialna praca i nikt nie chce si\u0119 podj\u0105\u0107. To jest i pisania du\u017co, praca fizyczna i umys\u0142owa. Chodzi o przepisy HCCP ( *przyp.:* *system zarz\u0105dzania bezpiecze\u0144stwa \u017cywno\u015bci* ) i Sanepidu ( *przyp.: Pa\u0144stwowa Inspekcja Sanitarna* ) \u2013 ka\u017cd\u0105 potraw\u0119 jak\u0105 podajemy musimy opisa\u0107, w jakiej temperaturze podajemy, jak przyjmujemy towar \u2013 czy jest w dobrym stanie, czy jest data wa\u017cno\u015bci, czy nadaje si\u0119 do spo\u017cycia, temperatury w lod\u00f3wkach, \u015bniadanie opisujemy - co dla kogo idzie, w jakiej ilo\u015bci, \u017ceby oddzia\u0142y mia\u0142y l\u017cej; chemia, jakiej u\u017cywamy: jak, czym dezynfekujemy, kto; i podpisujemy si\u0119.\n\nBardzo ch\u0119tnie wyjecha\u0142abym. By\u0142am za granic\u0105 we W\u0142oszech trzy miesi\u0105ce jako opiekun starszych ludzi. Mia\u0142am tak\u0105 pani\u0105 \u2013 ma\u0142\u017ce\u0144stwo - na Sycylii. Nauczy\u0142am si\u0119 sama podstaw j\u0119zyka, poziom komunikatywy, ale niestety musia\u0142am wraca\u0107. Dzieci jeszcze nie by\u0142y samodzielne i nie mog\u0142am dosta\u0107 wi\u0119cej bezp\u0142atnego urlopu. Dyrektor nie chcia\u0142 si\u0119 zgodzi\u0107, a nie chcia\u0142am zostawia\u0107 tej pracy. Zostawi\u0119 to wszystko mo\u017ce jak babcia odejdzie, to wtedy. Mo\u017ce... My\u015bl\u0119, \u017ceby sprzeda\u0107 to mieszkanie. Przenie\u015b\u0107 si\u0119 bli\u017cej wi\u0119kszego miasta. \u017byjemy w takim kraju, \u017ce w takim ma\u0142ym mie\u015bcie wszyscy widz\u0105 i wiedz\u0105. Wstaj\u0119 rano - widz\u0105, \u017ce id\u0119 do pracy albo nie id\u0119 i pytaj\u0105 czy wolne mam. Wszystko ich interesuje. To nie jest zgodne z moim sumieniem i nieetyczne, \u017ceby po prostu si\u0119 zamkn\u0105\u0107 i nie odzywa\u0107, je\u015bli kto\u015b grzecznie spyta: gdzie idziesz, sk\u0105d idziesz. I to jest m\u0119cz\u0105ce.\n\nMam oparcie w dzieciach, rodzinie, przyjacio\u0142ach, s\u0105siadce. Nie jest \u017ale. Obym mia\u0142a zdrowie. Bo to jest najwa\u017cniejsze. A rzeczy materialne i pieni\u0105dze nie s\u0105 wa\u017cne. Wiara, mi\u0142o\u015b\u0107, zgoda... A B\u00f3g daje si\u0142y w ka\u017cdej sytuacji. Boli mnie co\u015b, pomodl\u0119 si\u0119: Bo\u017ce, daj si\u0142\u0119, \u017cebym szcz\u0119\u015bliwie wsta\u0142a do pracy, abym przespa\u0142a noc, szcz\u0119\u015bliwie wr\u00f3ci\u0142a do domu, daj si\u0142y moim dzieciom, zdrowie. Bo jak mam zdrowie, to zarobi\u0119 te pieni\u0105dze i jestem szcz\u0119\u015bliwa. Dobre s\u0142owo od bliskich - to jest najwa\u017cniejsze. Chodz\u0119 do ko\u015bcio\u0142a. Mam zaufanie. Nie zajmuje si\u0119 tematem afery pedofilii w ko\u015bciele. Czytam du\u017co, ale nie komentuj\u0119. Nawet z najbli\u017csz\u0105 rodzin\u0105 nie rozmawiam o tym, bo dla mnie to jest dra\u017cliwy temat troch\u0119. Ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 \u0142\u0105czy si\u0119 z polityk\u0105. Ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 to powinien by\u0107 ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142, a na kazaniach pewne sprawy nie powinny by\u0107 poruszane. Wida\u0107 zmiany w ko\u015bciele, mniej ludzi chodzi, bardzo \u017ale si\u0119 wypowiadaj\u0105 o ksi\u0119\u017cach. A teraz to ju\u017c w og\u00f3le... Odpychaj\u0105 wiernych od ko\u015bcio\u0142a sami ksi\u0119\u017ca, m\u0142odzie\u017c, dzieci. Takie s\u0105 tematy w ko\u015bciele, \u017ce tego nie powinno by\u0107. Dziecku zadaje pytanie, a ono nie wie czy mo\u017ce odpowiedzie\u0107 czy nie. Np. zadaj\u0105 pytanie na religii: dlaczego mamusia z tatusiem nie \u015bpi, tylko si\u0119 k\u0142\u00f3c\u0105. Dlatego nie wolno nic m\u00f3wi\u0107 w domu przy dzieciach. Pewne sprawy s\u0105 tabu.\n\nDzi\u0119kuj\u0119 Bogu za to, co mam i za t\u0105 prac\u0119. Mimo \u017ce ma\u0142o zarabiam, ale jest ona na ca\u0142y etat, sta\u0142a. Wiem, \u017ce mo\u017cna zmieni\u0107, ale co\u015b mnie powstrzymuje. Pracownik fizyczny jest \u017ale wynagradzany, za nisko, i jest poniewierany ca\u0142e \u017cycie. Bo ten, co troch\u0119 wyuczy si\u0119, nawet mo\u017ce bardziej umie si\u0119 wys\u0142owi\u0107... A pracownik fizyczny w moim odczuciu tak ma. Odczuwam to nawet w pracy. I to jest przykre. Warunki u nas w Polsce powinny by\u0107 takie, \u017ce pracownik fizyczny powinien pracowa\u0107 kr\u00f3cej \u2013 nie do 60 lat. Mam 36 lat pracy i jeszcze brakuje mi 10 lat do emerytury. To jest bardzo du\u017co. A s\u0105 zawody, gdzie przepracuje 25 lat i idzie na emerytur\u0119. Albo furtka powinna by\u0107 taka, \u017ce wa\u017cne ile przepracujesz, bo lata pracy mamy, tylko wieku jeszcze nie. Ca\u0142y czas dzieci mi sugeruj\u0105, \u017ce powinnam zmieni\u0107 prac\u0119, \u017cebym sw\u00f3j biznes otworzy\u0142a, np.: pierogarni\u0119. Niestety, \u017ceby co\u015b zmieni\u0107 trzeba mie\u0107 pieni\u0105dze. Moja c\u00f3rka skorzysta\u0142a z dotacji z urz\u0119du pracy. Jest kosmetyczk\u0105. Jest zadowolona. Sko\u0144czy\u0142a pedagogik\u0119 ze specjalizacj\u0105 logopedyczn\u0105 i nie pracuje w swoim zawodzie. My\u015bla\u0142am o tym, ale trzeba mie\u0107 lokal, pieni\u0105dze, warunki. Teraz nowoczesny sprz\u0119t jest bardzo drogi: s\u0105 kuchenki, s\u0105 patelnie, piece parowe. Na sam sprz\u0119t trzeba mie\u0107 ok. 60 tys. z\u0142. To jest bardzo drogie. My\u015bmy my\u015bla\u0142y z kole\u017cankami, z kt\u00f3rymi pracujemy, we trzy. No, ale to sp\u00f3\u0142ki s\u0105... Teraz my\u015bl\u0119, \u017ce mo\u017ce na emeryturze wyjad\u0119 za granic\u0119. Mo\u017ce tam si\u0119 jako\u015b cz\u0142owiek zaczepi. Mo\u017ce opiekuna medycznego jeszcze zrobi\u0107, bo teraz tylko dokument jest potrzebny. Chocia\u017c do nas do pracy kilka os\u00f3b zosta\u0142o przyj\u0119tych bez wykszta\u0142cenia i dobrze sobie radz\u0105. W urz\u0119dzie pracy nie ma dla nas oferty, \u017ceby zrobi\u0107 nieodp\u0142atnie kurs, s\u0105 tylko dla bezrobotnych. Mog\u0119 si\u0119 zwolni\u0107 z pracy albo sama zap\u0142aci\u0107 za kurs.\n\nZe \u015brodk\u00f3w europejskich skorzysta\u0142am: posz\u0142am do liceum mniej wi\u0119cej 5-6 lat temu. To by\u0142 nacisk dyrektora, bo powiedzia\u0142 \u017ce nas zwolni, jak nie zrobimy szko\u0142y. Tylko ten jeden raz skorzysta\u0142y\u015bmy z projektu. Je\u015bli kto\u015b chce pracowa\u0107, to znajdzie prac\u0119. Oferty s\u0105: dorywczo sprz\u0105tanie mieszka\u0144, opieka nad osobami starszymi. W okolicach jest opieka, nawet w weekendy. Mo\u017cna mie\u0107 sta\u0142\u0105 prac\u0119: w gastronomii, mycie okien, sprz\u0105tanie, opieka. Praca jest raczej na godzin\u0119. Wynagrodzenie 15-20 z\u0142 - zale\u017cy od lokalizacji. Jak kto\u015b chce, to zarobi. Nawet w polu sezonowo: truskawki, porzeczki, maliny. Telefony si\u0119 urywaj\u0105, ale za ma\u0142o p\u0142ac\u0105 i nikt nie chce pracowa\u0107. Pierwszy raz nie posz\u0142am w pole w tym roku, dlatego \u017ce w pracy dwie kole\u017canki s\u0105 na zwolnieniu i jestem po zabiegu dw\u00f3ch r\u0105k.\n\nCoraz starsza jestem, boj\u0119 si\u0119. Musz\u0119 dba\u0107 o zdrowie. A i tak przesiedzia\u0142am 8 miesi\u0119cy na zwolnieniu. Od d\u017awigania mia\u0142am zesp\u00f3\u0142 cie\u015bni, czyli nie mia\u0142am si\u0142y w palcach. Nie mog\u0142am si\u0119 ubra\u0107, biustonosza za\u0142o\u017cy\u0107, szklanki wzi\u0105\u0107 do r\u0119ki, bola\u0142o mnie, puch\u0142y mi r\u0119ce po nocy. A teraz ju\u017c szcz\u0119\u015bliwa jestem. 10 lat za p\u00f3\u017ano posz\u0142am. Mam jeszcze nacisk w kr\u0119gos\u0142upie. Kr\u0119gos\u0142up siada teraz. \u0141atwo by\u0142o mi si\u0119 dosta\u0107 do lekarza, bo znajomy mi za\u0142atwi\u0142 skierowanie na badania. Bo inaczej my\u015bl\u0119, \u017ce bym bardzo d\u0142ugo czeka\u0142a. Potem rehabilitacja ju\u017c bez za\u0142atwiania. Czeka\u0142am niewiele ponad miesi\u0105c. Mia\u0142am te\u017c napi\u0119cie mi\u0119\u015bniowe. To bierze si\u0119 ze stresu.\n\nMoja praca jest bardzo stresuj\u0105ca. Dlatego nikt nie chce tu pracowa\u0107. Je\u015bli co\u015b si\u0119 stanie, to prokurator ju\u017c wchodzi. Teraz musimy wszystko opisywa\u0107. Nie ma ju\u017c pr\u00f3bek tzw. pokarmowych, tylko teraz dietetyczka robi jad\u0142ospis na 10 dni, wysy\u0142a do Sanepidu i on wylicza ile tam jest kalorii. A tak przyje\u017cd\u017cali, robili naloty, brali pr\u00f3bki pokarmu w odpowiednie pojemniki, badali i na tej podstawie wyliczali kalorie. Jest to wa\u017cne pod wzgl\u0119dem kalorycznym, kolorystycznym i smakowym. Teraz jest \u0142atwiej. Tylko jest du\u017co dokumentacji. Jestem w zwi\u0105zku zawodowym tylko na nasz zak\u0142ad pracy. Nic nie robi. Pisa\u0142y\u015bmy pismo do starosty o podwy\u017cki. Organizuj\u0105 jakie\u015b grile. Nie powiem, bo jak dzieje si\u0119 krzywda, to s\u0105 pomocni, udzielaj\u0105 rad, kredytu, je\u015bli jest bardzo ci\u0119\u017cko, nawet bezzwrotnie. Du\u017co rozmawiaj\u0105 w cztery oczy. To jest takie wsparcie. Jest pomoc psychologiczna, bo mo\u017cemy chodzi\u0107 do psychologa, kt\u00f3ry pracuje u nas. Ma\u0142o os\u00f3b korzysta, bo znamy si\u0119, a jednak najlepiej chodzi\u0107 do obcego.\n\nUwa\u017cam, \u017ce ta rozmowa zupe\u0142nie inaczej wygl\u0105da. Korzysta\u0142am kiedy\u015b. Bardzo pomog\u0142o. Chodzi\u0142am razem z dzie\u0107mi, bo m\u00f3j m\u0105\u017c si\u0119 powiesi\u0142. Ci\u0119\u017cko by\u0142o mu rozsta\u0107 si\u0119 z mam\u0105. Po przeprowadzce przespa\u0142 w nowym mieszkaniu jedn\u0105 noc. Pojechali\u015bmy na chwil\u0119 po telewizor, po komputer. P\u0119powina nie mog\u0142a si\u0119 po prostu przeci\u0105\u0107. Jestem wdzi\u0119czna. Bardzo dzi\u0119kuj\u0119 jej za pomoc psychologiczn\u0105. To wraca, ale z pozytywn\u0105 energi\u0105, \u017ce musz\u0119 sobie poradzi\u0107. Tak umia\u0142a nas ukierunkowa\u0107. Wiedzia\u0142am to od pocz\u0105tku i uczy\u0142am tego dzieci, \u017ce trzeba sobie poradzi\u0107. Nie trzeba dolewa\u0107 oliwy do ognia, tylko rozmowa, nie trzeba krzycze\u0107, problemy si\u0119 rozwi\u0105zuje. Jeli nie mog\u0119 sama sobie poradzi\u0107, mam przyjaci\u00f3\u0142, rodzin\u0119, dzieci. Rozmawiamy bardzo du\u017co. Nie m\u00f3wi\u0119, \u017ce nie ma problem\u00f3w, bo s\u0105 przer\u00f3\u017cne. Nie p\u0142aka\u0142am ju\u017c bardzo dawno, bo p\u0142acz nie pomo\u017ce. Zmartwienia by\u0142y, i s\u0105, i b\u0119d\u0105, ale jak ma si\u0119 kogo\u015b blisko, to nie s\u0105dz\u0119, \u017ce \u017ale b\u0119dzie. Zaufanie to jest najbardziej dla mnie atut. Tego uczy\u0142am dzieci i to jest najwa\u017cniejsze. I po tym psychologu lubi\u0119 pomaga\u0107 ludziom. To mi imponuje. Co mog\u0119, to pomog\u0119. Du\u017co chorowa\u0142am, ale chyba te moje modlitwy. Pisz\u0119 nawet do Matki, do Fatimy tam. Jako\u015b mi to pomaga\u0142o. By\u0142am w szpitalu bardzo cz\u0119sto, bo mam chore nerki, ale ta dobro\u0107 chyba wraca. Nie mia\u0142am problem\u00f3w z lekarzami. Tak to odbieram, \u017ce z\u0142o wraca ze stokrotnym uderzeniem, a dobro tak samo. Lekarze zaj\u0119li si\u0119 mn\u0105 pod ka\u017cdym wzgl\u0119dem bardzo dobrze, ale my\u015bl\u0119, \u017ce ja to uprosi\u0142am.\n\nG\u0142osuj\u0119 w wyborach. Nie mam partii, na kt\u00f3r\u0105 g\u0142osuj\u0119. Jestem bezpartyjna. Mam swoje zdanie, ale konkretnej sta\u0142ej partii nie mam. Wcze\u015bniej to Platforma Obywatelska, na Prawo i Sprawiedliwo\u015b\u0107 na pewno nie. Nie mog\u0119 sobie tego wyobrazi\u0107, \u017ce to rozdawanie pieni\u0119dzy 500+ jest po prostu... Le\u017c\u0105 pieni\u0105dze na ziemi, a chodz\u0105 i \u017cebrz\u0105. Mi zawsze odmawiali. Najpierw do w\u00f3jta, a potem do naszego burmistrza zwraca\u0142am si\u0119 o pomoc. Nigdy nie dosta\u0142am do\u017cywiania ani pieni\u0119dzy opr\u00f3cz tych, co na dach, bo mi zawsze doch\u00f3d przekracza\u0142. Dzieci nie mia\u0142y renty ani nic po ojcu. Przez rok tylko jako matka samotnie wychowuj\u0105ca bra\u0142am 180 z\u0142 na dziecko. Dla os\u00f3b w mojej sytuacji wynagrodzenie minimalne powinno by\u0107 2 500 z\u0142 na r\u0119k\u0119. W por\u00f3wnaniu, piel\u0119gniarka idzie na jedn\u0105 noc i ma 300 z\u0142. I \u017ceby lata pracy si\u0119 liczy\u0142y, bez wzgl\u0119du na wiek. Jak p\u00f3jd\u0119 na emerytur\u0119, b\u0119d\u0119 mia\u0142a 46 lat pracy. To jest stanowczo za du\u017co. B\u0119dzie czas odpocz\u0105\u0107, wyjecha\u0107, zaj\u0105\u0107 si\u0119 wnukami w przysz\u0142o\u015bci. Po 50-tce si\u0119 cz\u0142owiek sypie. Do 50. roku \u017cycia chorowa\u0142am ca\u0142y czas. Mam 51 lat. Dobrze b\u0119dzie, nie za\u0142amuj\u0119 si\u0119. Nie lubi\u0119 PISu, tego gadulstwa, \u017ce jedna partia na drug\u0105 wiesza psy, skacz\u0105 sobie do oczu. To wszystko mo\u017cna dialogiem rozwi\u0105za\u0107. Co\u015b si\u0119 wydarzy - to jeden do drugiego. Jest wolno\u015b\u0107 s\u0142owa, ale bez przesady: co si\u0119 nie pojawi, komentarz od razu. I stanowczo za du\u017co zarabiaj\u0105. S\u0105 ju\u017c w wieku emerytalnym, ale zawieszaj\u0105 ( *przyp.: emerytur\u0119* ) i pracuj\u0105. Co ma zrobi\u0107 w domu? B\u0119dzie siedzia\u0142 z kotkiem? W PO podoba\u0142o mi si\u0119, \u017ce da\u0142o si\u0119 z nimi rozmawia\u0107.

A po tych wypowiedziach ich mo\u017cna stwierdzi\u0107, \u017ce s\u0105 szkoleni, uczeni, a kultury zero. PIS kultury zero ma. PO te\u017c nie brakuje... Wcze\u015bniej wi\u0119cej czyta\u0142am i ogl\u0105da\u0142am, a teraz to w og\u00f3le nie ogl\u0105dam. Po pierwsze nie mam kiedy. Przejrz\u0119 internet i wystarczy. I te komentarze cudne. Wol\u0119 si\u0119 pomodli\u0107. Polityk\u0119 prze\u0142\u0105czam. Babcia jeszcze jak zobaczy, to ju\u017c w og\u00f3le prze\u0142\u0105cza. Ostatnio g\u0142osowa\u0142am na Kukiza spontanicznie, bo nie wzi\u0119\u0142am okular\u00f3w, nie widzia\u0142am za bardzo. Sz\u0142am z pracy. Po rozmowie jeszcze z synem \u2013 \u201ena tych Platfus\u00f3w to nie g\u0142osuj\u201d. \u201eNa PIS te\u017c nie, to na kogo?\u201d. \u201eNa muzykanta\u201d.

Cz\u0119sto go s\u0142ucham, czytam, rozmawiam z nim oczywi\u015bcie. Chocia\u017c Franciszek jest podobny. Wcale nie jest gorszy. Trzeba wiedzie\u0107 komu zaufa\u0107 i dobrze ulokowa\u0107 uczucia. Pomodl\u0119 si\u0119 i wierz\u0119, \u017ce ta si\u0142a wy\u017csza dzia\u0142a. \u017beby nie on, mo\u017ce to inaczej by si\u0119 potoczy\u0142o.

Wysy\u0142amy smsy na chore dzieci. Chc\u0119, \u017ceby pomaga\u0142y bezinteresownie na ulicy. Jak zostaje nam jedzenie, to pomagam, zawo\u017c\u0119. Pieni\u0105dze: ile mam, to dam. Ubrania oddaj\u0119. Wady mam i zalety, ale trzeba zapomnie\u0107 i i\u015b\u0107 dalej, do przodu. Co niekt\u00f3rym to si\u0119 nie podoba.

Do we have a list of sites to contact for potential link sharing or banner placement? \n\nSecond thing - Nadia mentioned sharing on our networks and through the event organisers profiles with header/footer images - including perhaps a link in their bio (completely voluntary of course) to festival tickets page.\n\nThird thing was using LinkedIn combined with [DuxSoup](https://www.dux-soup.com/) - this is a lead generator that sends follow up messages to people who visited your profile. I am not on Linked In - I should be, but can we get all our festival curators / participants to consider this and the above?

With good food and extraordinary company. \n\nFeel free to modify the wording in any way.. \n\nFor the workshops we are sending invitations to a list of Facebook groups Nadia has put together, drafted in French, English and Arabic. There is still a lot of translation work to do for the Workshop and Fellowship pages in Arabic and French, which I can help with.\n\nAre there more options here for pushing sales (I know it's not an easy or attractive topic) that we have not mentioned?

Yes..  It's always good to remember where did it start because two years ago I didn't think about cycling as mobility (more as a leisure activity) until I moved to Berlin and got my first cycling-culture shock :smile: It's not only the number of cyclists that caught my attention but also the planning culture that is a bit different from what we have in Egypt .... the year I moved to Berlin there was the Fahrrad Volksentscheid (a city-wide petition making a political pressure for a better cycling infrastructure and laws) and the Radbahn project that is a bike way designed by a group of volunteers to utilize the space under the U-bahn overpass.\nI used to complain about traffic like everyone else in Egypt but then I realized that I can actually try to do something. In Berlin, you can legitimately raise a petition to change the law and the infrastructure on ground. In Egypt, that's not the case so you have to find your own way either by being part of the civil society and/or private sector or to try to reach out for the decision makers. The civil society is now moving to spread the cycling culture among the youth but it doesn't speak the same language that the decision makers do... there are always questions about the economic viability and skeptic voices questioning adopting the European experience in a very different socio-economic situation .... so I try to answer these questions (is it be economically beneficial to the individual and the city? what can the private sector do? what can we learn from places with comparable socio-economic conditions?

It is not at all a bike-friendly city, but getting better. \n\nI found a super-interesting 20 minute documentary about being a cyclist in a city where nobody cycles. The main story is that of Karl-Heinz Pohl, a guy who started the city first bike courier service, [Pedal BXL](https://pedalbxl.wordpress.com). The gridlock in the city was actually good for his business, because his couriers can be much faster than cars. The company now also organises (and sells) bike tours for cities.\n\nThe documentary contains many interesting ideas for developing a cycling culture. Karl-Heinz himself notes (15') that he has almost no client from the public sector. And yet, if the municipality or the ministries used their services, they would send a cultural signal and help develop that market. More ideas come from [Klaus Bondam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Bondam), a Danish politician who was active in the administration of Copenhagen, and now lives in Brussels.

Kiedy minister Barbara Blida uzasadnia\u0142a wprowadzenie go w \u017cycie nawet nie ukrywa\u0142a, \u017ce staje w obronie interes\u00f3w w\u0142a\u015bcicieli zasobu mieszkaniowego. Wmawia\u0142a, \u017ce eksmisja dotknie marginalnej liczby os\u00f3b, kt\u00f3ra celowo nie p\u0142aci za czynsz i \u017cyje na koszt reszty lokator\u00f3w. Spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwo polskie zaakceptowa\u0142o eksmisje jak co\u015b oczywistego. Nie mo\u017cna by\u0142o tolerowa\u0107 os\u00f3b unikaj\u0105cych op\u0142at za mieszkanie.\n\nNarracja o tym, \u017ce dach nad g\u0142ow\u0105 jest takim samym towarem jak asortyment wystawiany na p\u00f3\u0142kach w sklepie przyj\u0119to na pocz\u0105tku lat 90-tych bez dyskusji. Politycy, dziennikarze, publicy\u015bci, tak\u017ce osoby ze sfery nauki uzasadniali wycofanie si\u0119 pa\u0144stwa ze wspierania taniego budownictwa jednym prostym zdaniem: \u201eCzasy PRL-u min\u0119\u0142y\u201d. Teraz b\u0119dziesz mia\u0142 mieszkanie, je\u015bli b\u0119dziesz mia\u0142 dobr\u0105 prac\u0119, a je\u015bli j\u0105 utracisz, niezale\u017cnie od przyczyn musisz wynaj\u0105\u0107 na wolnym rynku. Ta prostacka, antyhumanitarna filozofia jest powodem obecnych patologii w spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwie. W pierwszych latach obowi\u0105zywania ustawy Blidy wida\u0107 by\u0142o efekty tego, co zosta\u0142o przez rz\u0105d SLD-PSL wprowadzone. Zarz\u0105dzaj\u0105cy zasobem mieszkaniowym krezusi systemu kapitalistycznego ch\u0119tnie pozbywali si\u0119 z mieszka\u0144 s\u0142abych, chorych, niepe\u0142nosprawnych, rodzin i samotnych matek z dzie\u0107mi. Po opr\u00f3\u017cnieniu mieszkania cz\u0119sto sta\u0142y puste. Kamienice komunalne wielu polskich miastach nieremontowane latami przez celowe zaniedbania w\u0142adz sta\u0142y si\u0119 celem deweloper\u00f3w oraz oszust\u00f3w. Przy aprobacie w\u0142adz centralnych i lokalnych zacz\u0119li przejmowa\u0107 budynki w ramach prywatyzacji oraz reprywatyzacji. Budynki b\u0119d\u0105ce w z\u0142ym stanie by\u0142y burzone (wszak grunta by\u0142y istotniejszej), inne remontowane nie dla dotychczasowych lokator\u00f3w, ale dla nowych, z du\u017cym portfelem. Po starych mieszka\u0144cach nie zostawa\u0142o nic poza wspomnieniem. Wiele z nich walczy\u0142o i nadal walczy o prawo do dalszego zamieszkiwania lub do innego lokalu komunalnego. Niestety w\u0142adze samorz\u0105dowe robi\u0105 wszystko celem niezaspokajania potrzeb mieszkaniowych. Ch\u0119tniej dzia\u0142aj\u0105 w interesie bran\u017cy deweloperskiej. Sprzedaj\u0105c im po okazyjnych cenach miejskie grunty. Cz\u0119sto id\u0105 na to ogromne \u0142ap\u00f3wki ze strony tych firm dla urz\u0119dnik\u00f3w podejmuj\u0105cych korzystne dla nich decyzje.\n\nDzia\u0142aj\u0105c przez osiem lat w ruchach lokatorskich, najpierw w Komitecie Obrony Lokator\u00f3w (2011), a od pi\u0119ciu lat Warszawskim Stowarzyszeniu Lokator\u00f3w im. Jolanty Brzeskiej stykam si\u0119 osobi\u015bcie ze skutkami braku polityki mieszkaniowej. W ka\u017cd\u0105 \u015brod\u0119 na sk\u0142ocie \u201eSyrena\u201d znajduj\u0105cym si\u0119 w centrum Warszawy cz\u0142onkowie w ramach dy\u017curu lokatorskiego wraz z prawnikiem s\u0142u\u017c\u0105 pomoc\u0105 warszawskim lokatorom maj\u0105cym problemy mieszkaniowe. Od 16.30-17.30 mo\u017cna uzyska\u0107 pomoc prawn\u0105 oraz wsparcie w trudnych sprawach. Jak s\u0105 to powa\u017cne problemy nie daj\u0105ce normalnie funkcjonowa\u0107 w \u017cyciu przekona\u0142em si\u0119 sam. W\u0142a\u015bnie moje w\u0142asne perturbacje mieszkaniowe sk\u0142oni\u0142y mnie do wej\u015bcia w ruch lokatorski. Podj\u0105\u0142em dobr\u0105 decyzj\u0119. Dzia\u0142aj\u0105c z innymi osobami dotkni\u0119tymi bezwzgl\u0119dno\u015bci\u0105 wolnego rynku mieszkaniowego oraz reprywatyzacji zrozumia\u0142em, \u017ce m\u00f3j przypadek nie jest odosobniony. Przez lata k\u0142opoty mieszkaniowe moje i mojej mamy prze\u017cywa\u0142em wy\u0142\u0105cznie sam. Przez to nie mog\u0142em mie\u0107 szerszego poj\u0119cia, \u017ce wynikaj\u0105 one z b\u0142\u0119dnej polityki pa\u0144stwa. Politycy zar\u00f3wno maj\u0105cy rodow\u00f3d pezetpeerowski jak solidarno\u015bciowy w 1989 roku uznali, \u017ce si\u0142\u0105 Polski b\u0119dzie od teraz prywatna w\u0142asno\u015b\u0107, wolny rynek i indywidualizm. Jestem jedn\u0105 z ofiar indywidualizmu i egoizmu. Nie tylko ja. Jak powiedzia\u0142 Piotr Ikonowicz z Ruchu Sprawiedliwo\u015bci Spo\u0142ecznej na spotkaniu sympatyk\u00f3w i cz\u0142onk\u00f3w WSL-u z okazji Mi\u0119dzynarodowego Dnia Lokator\u00f3w 5 pa\u017adziernika 2019 roku, eksmisja oraz brak szansy na mieszkanie jest jednym z wa\u017cnych powod\u00f3w do emigracji z Polski. Zgadzam si\u0119 z nim w stu procentach. Przez lata mojej dzia\u0142alno\u015bci w ruchach lokatorskich widz\u0119, \u017ce ub\u00f3stwo mieszkaniowe dotyka w takim samym stopniu ludzi starszych, co m\u0142odych. Rozmawiaj\u0105c z osobami przychodz\u0105cymi do nas na dy\u017cur poznaj\u0119 ich smutne, niekiedy tragiczne historie. Bardzo trudno nie by\u0107 poruszonym. Wielu ma nam za z\u0142e, \u017ce blokujemy eksmisje. Zarzuca si\u0119 nam, \u017ce stoimy po stronie \u201eoszust\u00f3w\u201d, kt\u00f3rzy nie chc\u0105 p\u0142aci\u0107 za czynsz jak reszta. Nie jest to prawda. Blokada jest powstrzymaniem od stoczenia si\u0119 na dno zagro\u017conej eksmisj\u0105 osobie lub osobom. Eksmisja jest z\u0142em, poniewa\u017c stanowi jedyne narz\u0119dzie polityki mieszkaniowej w Polsce od 1994 roku. Zblokowanie wej\u015bcia komornika do mieszkania lub w\u0142a\u015bciciela ma ochroni\u0107 lokatora przed znalezieniem si\u0119 na ulicy, a jednocze\u015bnie daje szans\u0119 nag\u0142o\u015bnienia sprawy oraz dzia\u0142ania na rzecz znalezienia innego lokum. Bardzo wiele os\u00f3b zagro\u017conych eksmisj\u0105 wpad\u0142a w d\u0142ugi przez przypadki losowe. S\u0105 to choroby, utrata pracy, trwa\u0142e bezrobocie czy stali si\u0119 ofiarami oszustwa. Ka\u017cdemu z nas mo\u017ce sta\u0107 si\u0119 krzywda w \u017cyciu, wa\u017cne jest zaradzi\u0107 temu. Nie za\u015b pogr\u0105\u017ca\u0107 t\u0105 osob\u0119 jeszcze bardziej, funduj\u0105c jej \u017cycie na ulicy. Organizujemy tak\u017ce pikiety dotycz\u0105ce spraw lokatorskich. Ka\u017cdego 1 marca w rocznic\u0119 zab\u00f3jstwa dzia\u0142aczki lokatorskiej Jolanty Brzeskiej organizujemy pikiet\u0119 czy to pod budynkiem Komendy Sto\u0142ecznej Policji czy siedzib\u0105 Prokuratury Generalnej. Chcemy w ten spos\u00f3b (jako dzia\u0142acze lokatorscy) przypomnie\u0107, \u017ce nie wyja\u015bniono sprawy okoliczno\u015bci \u015bmierci Jolanty Brzeskiej oraz os\u0105dzenia sprawc\u00f3w tej zbrodni z przed prawie dziewi\u0119ciu laty.\n\nPo tych o\u015bmiu latach patrz\u0105c z perspektywy uczestnika ruch\u00f3w lokatorskich i osoby, kt\u00f3ra pad\u0142a ofiar\u0105 polityki pa\u0144stwa traktuj\u0105cej mieszkanie jako towar do spekulacji, a nie miejsce do mieszkania, uwa\u017cam ten czas za wykorzystany po\u017cytecznie. Nie zamkn\u0105\u0142em si\u0119 po traumach trzydziestu lat swojego \u017cycia. Postanowi\u0142em wykorzysta\u0107 swoje do\u015bwiadczenia w dzia\u0142alno\u015bci lokatorskiej.

We need it, because we need (some) first world people to work with us, and maybe we just want it because it reflects our own aspirations.

About organizing the trade, I would propose a bit different setup. (This is based on the logistics we settled on for the epelia.com direct sales marketplace, using \"shipment centers\" for distribution.)\n\nSo there would be an online platform, and it will make operations cheaper than selling through any \"brick and mortar\" physical store. However, doing an international parcel shipment from Tunisia to Europe every time an order comes in is expensive, often so expensive that it makes it no longer meaningful for customers to buy the item. To solve this, we would utilize the connected spaces of the network as shipment centers. They all agree to have a small warehouse one room and to ship what is sold from it online. So you'd send a larger parcel (30 kg) of crafts to one space of the network in each country, and they store it and sell it inside their own country on demand. National parcel shipment is much cheaper.\n\nAlso this way, there is the added benefit that online customers can order from other goods stored in the same space and receive them in the same parcel, without additional shipping costs.

The governement is indeed trying to do it but is more focused on companies rather than local communities and on big business entreprise software rather than opensource ones. The reason of these choices are quite obvious. But as edgeryders, I think that another way more decentralized and more grassroots based is possible and complementary.\n\nAnyway, this strategy difficult mainly for these 3 reasons:\n\n1. top-to-bottom strategy with opensource community members tends to fail because of resistance, misunderstanding and lack of enthusiasm. Local opensource developers tends to be like Western ones, they want to reinvent the wheel, learn an heterodox programming language, code an OS and other not very productive projects...\n2. if the chosen technology failed, you've put a lot of money in one basket... this seems to be the case in the past (OLPC, Firefox OS and some other projects). This leads to discouragement :sweat:\n3.  it requires a lot of time and trust-building to funnel people to the same goal\n\nThat's why I'm trying to build something step-by-step.

As a result, Italy spends [a lot of money](http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/information/publications/factsheets/2014/cohesion-policy-and-italy) trying to develop that area. \n\nI am convinced that open source models are a very good fit for less developed areas. A great open source project is made of time. When time is expensive, it gets more difficult to develop it. For southern Italy, I imagined targeted investments, aimed at brewing a local community with very strong expertise in one or more of the staple projects: things like Drupal or Wordpress are more conducive to making simple websites for the local companies; things like MySQL or Apache, more to IT services for corporations. With open source, local companies do not need to bootstrap expertise all along the value chain: they can focus on getting very good at solving one or a few problems, and then deploy their solutions on top of off-the-shelf open source stacks. \n\nIf I were the government of a less developed country, I would totally do it. :slight_smile:", "created_at": "2017-08-24 20:54:37.487428", "updated_at": "2017-08-24 21:40:25.751956", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 232, "wiki": false, "reads": 20, "score": 19.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 34815, "user_id": 3812, "topic_id": 6785, "post_number": 13, "raw": "I love their work!

An experience full of challenges as any entrepreneurial initiative in such a big city like Casablanca.\n\nI am fascinated by the work of Edgeryders and it really was a super interesting discovery.\n\nI am now the engagement manager of Morocco and very happy to be part of this adventure.\n\nI'd love to talk to people in the community and share our experiences and views, so feel free to contact me.\n\nNB : excuse my english, I really miss practicing ^^\n\nCheers everyone !\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-12 11:12:15", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:25.648919", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 338, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2551, 2201], "is_private": false}, {"id": 84305, "user_id": 6103, "topic_id": 14517, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Thank you @felix.wolfsteller for linking us here.

It was our time of most rapid growth and the time when our coworkers were working together as they and we did not before or since.\n\nIt is my own basic belief that coworking is best framed as the infrastructure of the future of work.

I should probably say it differently:  I was never able to make that work.  \n\nIn may ways coworking has been internally focused and complacent with it, there are huge portions of society who have never heard of it or who have not been included as part of the movement and that is also not sustainable.

Those who are introverted enough to be considered geeks or \u201con the spectrum\u201d tend to have one \u201cpassion activity\u201d on which they can focus all their attention and never get bored. That can be anything \u2013 whatever humans can be interested in deeply can qualify, from playing an instrument to woodworking, metalworking, programming or sci-fi geekery. (Personally, I was quite happily busy with learning an obscure 3D CAD tool for some weeks in the last months.)\n\nSuch an activity can really help to get through lonely times, but I\u2019m not sure how useful that advice can be for extroverted people.\n[/quote]\n\nI feel similarly. As an introvert, I must admit that the situation has been somewhat heavenly for the most part in terms of decreased strain. I never get the alone time that I need in the flow of normal life and feel exhausted at the end of every day from all the social interaction. I've gotten to do so much writing and reading because of the space, time and energy to think. I never get bored or lonely. \n\nWhat I miss is the travel and daily non-intensive interactive motion, where I feel like I'm alone around people and feeling the changed vibe of new places -- getting coffee at a coffeeshop, people watching, experiencing live music, wandering around a museum or art exhibition-- where I don't have to put effort into social interaction but I can experience the flow of the world. And I do miss my one-on-ones with close friends (no small talk necessary, more of the 'sharing abstract ideas and concepts' that @matteo_uguzzoni talks about. I find that I can do some of this by sharing a poem or song I've discovered that I know a friend would like) and more low-key or ambient sociality (playing games, both sports and board games, with people around, or playing music with friends). But it's a manageable form of missing, I don't mind the quiet and could do this for another year if we had to. \n\nI find that the flip of this, though, is that I have to work a lot harder to maintain social ties during the pandemic, since the zoom call is quite labour-intensive socially. So when I do want to talk or hang out with people, it's harder in this situation than just getting coffee and going for a walk with someone, going to listen to some music (really miss live shows), having a small group of friends over for dinner and games or kicking a football around. Those forms of sociality are hard in a pandemic. \n\n@yudhanjaya, my partner has been getting back into WoW, something he loved as a kid, and it's been fun to watch since the world is so rich visually. I was a Neverwinter Nights kid myself :laughing: and last time I had a lot of downtime I played through some of my old favourites from when I was younger -- Portal 1&2, Bioshock, Half Life 1&2. One of my friends and I love playing Towerfall together which is always super fun. I'm thinking about starting some newer ones now. I think video games are an awesome way of experiencing the feeling of being in a new world/space when you can't travel (and even when you can). I hate the grind though so I need specific games to not get overwhelmed by frustration :sweat_smile: I'm more in it for the world and the story. I have a crew I play D&D with and that's good imaginative fun as well -- definitely a form of collective storytelling.\n\nIt's nice in this day and age that it's easy to connect with friends via text, so having a little check in via text is something I do fairly often, especially if I'm reminded of something one of them likes. Memes are always good form of communication :p \n\n@matteo_uguzzoni, I am an introvert but I like random surprise chats, particularly from you lovely chatty extroverts, so also please feel free to call :slight_smile:  same goes to all of you.

They have bullshitised the farmer's work to senseless proportions. There are forms to fill, logs to keep, HACCP to install and maintain, traceability and all the other cumbersome and unnecessary things.\n\nYes, we need it turned upside down. Most consumers don't care for organic certificates, but they **do** care about what they eat. So, the farmers should be encouraged to network, to offer informal distribution of their produce to the customer's doorstep, instead of spending their money on stamps and seals proudly marking their produce organic, and keep it wilting on a supermarket shelf because it's too expensive for a normal buyer.\n\nLet me present an example of a Serbian grower of rare maize varieties. He has certified it as organic, but yet he can't certify the maize flour coming from the very same certified maize! Because he hasn't an HACCP system in place. Rubbish.\n\nSo why not just forget about certification and build mutual trust among producers and consumers instead? The food doesn't have to be expensive to be healthy and flavourful. \n\nLet me present another example: if you go to a farmers' market, many times the tomato you buy is rather bland and run-of-the-mill. Because the farmer is a logical and streamline-oriented being and often sells somewhat underriped tomatoes because the unsold vegetables would otherwise go to waste. They spray it more because they have to return it home and keep it for another day. What I do is ask the farmer to let it ripe for another two or three days and convince him/her that I will come back and buy it, and they are happy to do so. They have never accepted any deposit money, they count on honour and their \"But don't let me down\" is, for me, the biggest bond to oblige. Because it's not his/her prime interest to sell underriped tomatoes, but to make ends meet.\n\nIf you encourage the farmer into doubling his/her production of heirloom varieties they grow for their families because you will come every day or two and buy it, they will be more than glad and may even offer to deliver it to your doors. What you two need is just a phone call. They are not a cheating race of humans, they are hard-working people, often misunderstood.

As you said, the infrastructure in rural regions is challenging to say the least.\n\nI ate wild berries whole summer here in Belgium. As some of the walking paths are very frequented, I couldn't understand why others weren't doing the same. Especially kids, they would stop by and look at me, wondering what am I doing maybe? Reminded me of an incredulous face a friend made when I told him he doesn't know what a tomato or an egg really tastes like.\nWell last year I took 2 of them, Brussels city kids, to a small village in Croatia. I think they ate 2kgs of tomatoes just for breakfast :rofl: :joy: :sweat_smile:.\nPeople are disconnected from the whole process, I wouldn't be surprised to hear children claiming berries grow in the supermarkets soon...so we do need to show them the value of proper nutrition.\nToo bad it's not done by those in charge of our health but, it's not profitable enough.\n\nAbout subsidies, the solution might be somewhere in between. I agree with @matthias , I don't believe in gifts as a sustainable solution for anything BUT, I spent quite some time working in rural development/EU funds ecosystem. There are real benefits for small farmers when they can buy machines and build structures, or plant trees which will last decades and bring steady revenue. So I totally support this kind of grants. I am well aware they are often not efficient or even written badly when influenced by bigger entities. That, depends of us, though, so system in place isn't that bad but we humans certainly like corrupting things.\nSo, for me long term solutions are definitely somewhere along @matthias thinking but there are very useful grants (if properly distributed) to speed things up.\nAlso, grants are pointless if the farmer cannot be competitive on the market due to conditions outside of his immediate influence. \n\nI also believe farmers can achieve much higher efficiency and reduce the cost further by cooperating and using planned development. That's what we are doing now in Croatia, in the village of my grandparents. There is too much distrust but, we have now 6 people willing to work together. Instead of all 6 buying one machine worth 20 000 euros, we will each buy a different one and use them for anyone who needs them. We will also create a brand where possible and a common platform for marketing our products/services. We simply need to create a very powerful example. It is pointless to talk in Balkans, there have been too many lies and empty promises, so just do it and do it well.  \n\nWhen do grants not work? Grants are pointless when there is no proper education of the population and monitoring/evaluation afterwards. In that case, they are a waste and in many cases do more damage than good.\nThey also don't work when the overall system enforced by relevant laws/treaties are favorable to huge companies. \nI believe food should be cheap. Why? Well because food is the most basic requirement for each human being. It is an essential part on our quest for freedom, as it is also a great tool for control. As Mathias said, a lot of people cannot afford quality food and they will go for the cheapest. It will later cost them much  more but what are they to do?\n\nFood is not expensive now because it must be. Food is expensive now because we created the system in which it MUST be expensive.\nOne of the big reasons is the abandonment of rural regions, migration to urban centers. It is increasing both the cost of living for everyone in cities and cost of production/delivery for smaller producers.\nAnother one is the taxes and laws put into place. Supposedly for protecting the consumer but in fact allowing big companies monopolies on life basically.\nNobody should be able to patent life. Nobody should be able to standardise life.\nAnother reason is linked to that as well. When people are fed the same story that they MUST BUY Z seed, for it they need X pesticide and Y fertiliser now. The seeds are of course sterile or will not yield almost anything if you dry them and replant the next year..and they all lead to the same company with 95% market share? What is that? It is a travesty of a system!\n\nSo what would be the solutions?\n\n1. Use the current crisis and upcoming economic difficulties + remote work possibilities to encourage migration back to the rural areas.\nPolicy encouragement, cheaper, greater self sufficiency, quality of life much higher (lower pollution) etc..there are many pros. The biggest con for city people would be lack of human potential when they look at some village etc. That can be changed very fast if done in an organised way. Bringing educated, creative people from cities to a rural area and combining them with the experience people there already have, would bring great results.\n\n2. Network! First network with other like minded people in cities (who are looking into moving), with idea of combining skills to build communities with great potential. Then network further, nationally and internationally, to create very big organisations which can represent us at the highest levels of policy making. There is always private power versus public power. We cannot compete in private power (financially), but they cannot compete in public power (votes).\n\n3. Participate to the maximum in local affairs. From my experience, there are a lot of ways to get authorities to build the much needed infrastructure. Some include simple persistency and activism, others include actually educating them (as they might not be aware of opportunities from various funds). Direct or participatory democracy can be implemented at that low level quite easily.", "created_at": "2020-10-23 13:58:47.903456", "updated_at": "2020-10-23 13:58:47.903456", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 999, "wiki": false, "reads": 25, "score": 85.0, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 5, 8, 3293], "is_private": false}, {"id": 85895, "user_id": 6856, "topic_id": 14594, "post_number": 28, "raw": "**If you are interested and want to join the event comment here.

Especially since it takes several years and a lot of mentorship, contacts and full time work to get there. Also the psychological and social pressures can be very tough on people trying to build/do new things. Not to mention the economic consequences of businesses that fail (which e.g. most start ups do).\n\nFor me the big lesson is that we need to look into incentivising collective investment into things which everyone benefits from but no one can/wants to \"carry\" alone.\n\nFor most people the only source of support is [Family](https://edgeryders.eu/t/who-will-really-support-social-innovation/1680) which has its' own challenges and anyway is not available for a lot of people.  In an ideal situation it would be everyone paying taxes in exchange for good services and a social security net. But this is far from realistic for many of us.\n\nSo we get try to build what we need from what we have. More specifically we are building OpenVillage as a peer-to-peer effort to help one another do three things:\n\n1. **co-saving:** Coordinate to make collective investments and build solutions that lower financial costs of living and doing business \n1. **co-earning:** Work together to build and grow different streams of revenue to support each other increase \n1. **co-creation:** Everyone needs other people to do things with. We maintain and grow a safe, welcoming and tolerant space where people can think, dream and experiment around new ideas together.\n\nI have a hunch for how to do this, but could use your help to flesh it out before I present it to the community. \n\nShould I share it with you?", "created_at": "2017-08-29 18:11:27.080011", "updated_at": "2017-08-29 18:11:27.080011", "deleted_at": null, "hidden":

The overarching logic behind their development and acquisition is generally to enable the provision of public services. [b]In recent decades this model has become overstretched[/b]: states have found themselves struggling to find the resources to keep those assets manned so that provision of such services could continue, and had to retreat from many non-core services. Consequently, many such assets lie unused; some are beginning to deteriorate. They are extremely varied in nature; many are buildings, gardens, parks.

For example, plans are emerging that could result in up to 500 public libraries being turned over to local communities, together with seed funding, allowing each local community to find a sustainable operation model for its library or see it die. [Locality](http://locality.org.uk), alone, has received over 6,500 enquiries from communities that are keen to acquire, develop and/or manage land and buildings over the past 5 years.\n\n[b]The Edgeryders community has accumulated significant experience in this area[/b]. Many of us have been experimenting with ways to communally manage diverse assets including: spaces like the unMonastery, digital mesh networks, geographic databases or software projects as public or common goods, oriented towards the community\u2019s well being. There is now evidence available to indicate that communities can indeed provide stewardship, re-using assets, exapting them for new uses, and preserving their functionality and beauty over time. However, issues of fairness arise around any reallocation of right-to-access that are not completely solved, and this makes policy making in this area potentially controversial. \n\n[b]We hereby convene an international gathering on the theme of transformational community stewardship[/b]. We believe the ability to come together to take care of assets in an unstable context is a key skill for surviving and thriving in the future. The gathering is meant as a locus to exchange information and practical knowledge on how we can put the stock of underutilized public assets to a better use. We are already in deep conversation with many people and groups working on this matter \u2013 from key policy advisors in the UK, to cooperative consultancies in Spain, to hackers and squatters in Poland and intentional communities in Ireland and Greece.\n\n_This post was written collaboratively by: Nadia El-Imam, Alberto Cottica and Arthur Doohan, Edgeryders; Ben Vickers, the unMonastery;

Introduction</h2>\n\nOpen Ethnographer is an open source tool for Qualitative Data Analysis (QDA), which is a way to systematize and understand long chunks of text and to make sense out of it.\n\nUsually, there are four main steps in the QDA analysis:\n\n1. **Preliminary coding.** A thorough reading of the content that leads to a draft list of codes, or tags, for certain portions of text.\n\n2. **Coding.** A careful reading, this time assigning a \u2018code\u2019 (a \"kind of hashtag without a hash\") to a relevant portion of a given text.\n\n3. **Building categories.** Group codes into categories for further analysis.\n\n4. **Analysis.** The content of the categories is described with references back to the text and the original quotations.\n\nOpen Ethographer (OE) is used for coding the content of a webpage without downloading it first. It is a simple to use and intuitive tool, and the instructions are below.\n\nThere is also another, legacy version now called \"Open Ethnographer for Drupal\", documented [here](/t/id/3939). All relevant parts of that documentation have also been incorporated into this topic, so it is not relevant for anything anymore.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2. Getting access</h2>\n\nTo be able to use Open Ethnographer, you must be a member of the [`annotator`](https://edgeryders.eu/groups/annotator) Discourse user group.\n\nTo become a member of that group, [visit the page of the group](https://edgeryders.eu/groups/annotator) and click the button to apply for membership. You will be able to write a bit about why you're applying. Then, the `annotator` group owners will see your request and one of them can then approve it. The owners are currently @amelia, @matthias and @alberto \u2013 if necessary, you can message them directly if you experience a problem with this process.\n\nIn addition, all administrator users of the Discourse platform automatically have access to Open Ethnographer.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--3\">3. Coding with Open Ethnographer</h2>\n\nThe basic steps are the same independent of the type of material you will be coding:\n\n1. **Log in** to edgeryders.eu as normal, with an account that is a staff user (moderator or admin).\n\n2. **Visit section \"User Settings\"** of the Open Ethnographer interface and create a user settings record for yourself. See section \"[Managing codes, annotations and settings](/t/-/6811#heading--4)\" for how to do this. (This is needed before you can start coding, as a workaround for [this issue](https://github.com/edgeryders/discourse/issues/198).)\n\n3. **Visit the Discourse topic** for which you want to see or add ethnographic coding.\n\n4. **Click on the link \"Coding View\" below the topic's title**. You will see a simple HTML page of the same topic, paginated in case there are many comments. For example, if the original topic URL was\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`https://edgeryders.eu/t/title-here/1234`\nthen you should now be on\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`https://edgeryders.eu/annotator/topics/1234`\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-1\">3.1. Coding of text</h3>\n\n* **To create** a new annotation (\"ethnographic coding\"):\n\n    1. **Select** some text and click the annotation button that will appear.\n\n    2. **Type** a substring of the code's name you want to tag with. \n\n        [Multi-substring search](https://github.com/edgeryders/discourse/issues/207) in code names is not implemented yet, so whatever you type, including spaces, will be searched for in all code names. In practice, it works best to type starting with the first character of the code's name but omitting all its ancestor codes, and to not omit any characters in the sequence.\n\n    3. **Choose** the desired code name. Either select it from the proposed completions, or type any code name that does not result in a proposed completions. In the latter case, that code will be created on-the-fly when you save this annotation.\n\n        As a special feature, it is also possible to create codes on-the-fly and sort them into the hierarchy in one step. Usually you would create codes on the first level only and later sort them into a hierarchy using the management functions. But if you want, you can also directly create them in the hierarchy by typing a code name that has `\" \u2192 \"` (space, arrow, space) between hierarchy levels, just the way that such codes are displayed in the auto-completion proposals.\n\n    4. **Click \"Save\".**\n\n* **To edit** an existing annotation, hover over text with yellow background, then click the pen icon :pencil2: in the popup that will appear.\n\n* **To delete** an existing annotation, hover over text with yellow background, then click the cross icon :heavy_multiplication_x: in the popup that will appear.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-2\">3.2. Coding of images</h3>\n\n![ImageAnnotating|650x448](upload://tmtuvYlSyVWCZfFRusW99O1MyVJ.png) \n\n* **To create** a new image annotation, pull up a rectangle around the image section you want to annotate, by clicking and dragging with the mouse pointer. Then select a code just as [when coding text](#heading--3-1).\n\n    You can create as many annotations on one image as you want, and their rectangles can intersect and contain one another.\n\n* **To edit** an existing image annotation, hover over the rectangle that represents the annotation to edit, then click the pen icon :pencil2: in the popover that will appear. Remove the existing code and select a new one. It is not possible to edit the size and position of the associated image selection; in that case, you'd have to delete and re-create the annotation with a different image section.\n\n* **To delete** an existing image annotation, hover over the rectangle that represents the annotation to delete, then click the cross icon :heavy_multiplication_x: in the popover that will appear.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-3\">3.3. Coding of videos</h3>\n\n![1|690x345](upload://4LwzfgHTKgXchutEujCqELZfm9T.jpeg)\n\n![2|690x345](upload://7mWE9UihVoZX1gKfwAiDTmo5HfN.png)\n\n![3|690x359](upload://reybpR5wZR72WkZycsqx2K4cDRn.png)\n\n**How to code a video.** In the coding interface, you will see a link \"See annotations / add annotations\" below each video that can be coded. Click on it to go to the video coding interface, then click the top-left play button in the video to start it. Then:\n\n* **To create** a new video annotation:\n\n    1. Wait for the position in the video where you want to start your annotation.\n\n    2. Click the \"New Annotation\" button in the player's toolbar. The player will pause and a popover window will appear.\n\n    3. Enter a tag just as [when coding text](#heading--3-1).\n\n    4. Move the yellow triangle markers to adjust start and end position of your annotation. Note that annotations in edit mode are shown in yellow, and only then the markers can be moved.\n\n    5. Click \"Save\".\n\n* **To view** existing annotations:\n\n    1. Click on the \"Show Annotations\" button. Bars will appear as overlay on the video, representing annotations with their start and end times. They appear as a stack in the order they were created, with the newest at the top and one annotation per row. Timestamps in the right corners indicate the creation times of the top and bottom visible annotations.\n\n    2. Hover over the bars to see information about each annotation.\n\n    3. Click on a bar to play the part of the video to which the respective annotation belongs.\n\n* **To filter** existing annotations by video time range in cases where the list is otherwise too long to work with:\n\n    1. Click on the \"Show Annotations\" button. Again, bars represent annotations.\n\n    2. Move the orange triangles in the top left and right corners to define the time range of the video slider that should be used as a filter to show annotations.\n\n    3. Now, only the annotations that at least partially overlap with the selected time range are shown.\n\n* **To edit** an existing video annotation:\n\n    1. Click on the \"Show Annotations\" button. Bars will appear as overlay on the video, representing annotations with their start and end times.\n\n    2. Hover over the bars to show the popover window with information about the annotation.\n\n        (You can also click on one such annotation to play its associated video snippet, and then hover over the bar in its new position near the video player timeline. The same popover with information will show.)\n\n    3. Move the cursor into this popover window and click the pen icon :pencil2: that will appear.\n\n    4. You can now remove the annotation's code and add a new one, and also adjust the start and end position by moving the yellow triangles.\n\n    5. Click \"Save\".\n\n* **To delete** an existing video annotation, proceed as for editing an annotation but click on the cross icon :heavy_multiplication_x: instead of the pen icon.\n\n**Types of videos.** Videos can be added to Discourse in several ways, and the process to code them is different due to legal and technical reasons:\n\n* **Videos uploaded to Discourse.** When a user uploads a video as `.mp4` file while creating a Discourse post, it will be shown in the browser's default player embedded into the post. Such videos can be coded directly. Currently, the upload file size limit is 100 MiB to keep our backups manageable \u2013 so, choose your MP4 video quality and encoding well!\n\n* **Videos uploaded elsewhere and referenced as a file.** Instead of uploading a video directly to edgeryders.eu, you can also upload it to a different platform like [Imgur](https://imgur.com/) as long as that platform provides a direct link to the uploaded `.mp4` file. When placing such a link on its own line in a Discourse post, it will result in an embedded video as well, and such a video can also be coded directly.\n\n* **Videos uploaded to video platforms.** You cannot code videos embedded from YouTube, Vimeo etc.. This is due to legal reasons: YouTube's terms and conditions for example allow  showing the videos from their platform only with their player, but we need a special player to create the annotations. So before a coding project can begin, an administrator would have to edit these posts and transform such videos to one of the other two types listed above. Instead of replacing the original embedded video, the administrator can also add the codeable version below, hidden inside a foldable `[details=\"Summary\"] \u2026 [/details]` element. If the video was created for the user's post, this re-uploading will be covered by the Creative Commons licence that users grant for content they post on edgeryders.eu.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-4\">3.4. Coding of audio</h3>\n\nCurrently, coding of audio is covered by [coding a video](#heading--3-3) made from the audio and a still image.\n\nAt the start of a coding project, a platform admin might have to bring the audio into this format. This applies to cases where users added the audio by embedding a SoundCloud track or similar.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--4\">4. Managing codes, annotations and settings</h2>\n\nThe Open Ethnographer interface allows to administer codes, existing annotations and your user settings. Here's how:\n\n1. Log in to edgeryders.eu as normal, with an account that has [access to Open Ethnographer](/t/-/6811#heading-2).\n\n2. Visit (and bookmark) the link to the Open Ethnographer interface: [`edgeryders.eu/annotator`](https://edgeryders.eu/annotator).\n\n    You have to open this link in a new tab, or copy and paste it into the URL field of your browser. It will not work when you just click on it from inside Discourse to open it in the same tab. This is due to a Discourse bug / design issue.\n\nHow to use the different sections of the interface:\n\n* **Overview.** This shows a list of the last topics coded by you, so that you can quickly pick up on your work again.\n\n* **Codes.** Here, you can create, show, edit and delete ethnographic codes and their translations to various languages.\n\n    Currently, codes form one global hierarchy, for all authors combined. After each code in the list, the number of annotations using it is shown in parentheses. To delete a code, you have to manually delete its sub-codes first, or move them to other parent codes. (This is a measure against accidentally deleting too much.)\n\n    On the screen to edit a code, you can add translations of the code's name into other languages defined in section \"Languages\".\n\n* **Topics.** A list of all topics with at least one annotation. The list can be filtered by annotation author. Clicking on a list entry will bring you to the coding view for that topic so you can continue coding there. (To start coding in a new topic, you have to use the \"Coding View\" link at its top.)\n\n* **Annotations.** Shows the existing annotations of all ethnographers. You can see their data, filter by creator, and change the creator (but this will only be needed during imports and other administrative changes). All other changes to annotations are done in the [coding view](/t/6811#heading--3).\n\n* **Languages.** Allows to define the set of languages that can be used in  code names.\n\n* **User settings.** Allows to configure some aspects of the Open Ethnographer behavior per user:\n\n    * **Language.** Set and change your standard coding language. After changing this, all codes you create afterwards will by default assume that the code name is in the language you chose here. Existing codes are not affected. (You can change the language of any existing code in section \"Codes\".) If you can't find your preferred coding language in the list, create it first in section \"Languages\".\n\n    * **Discourse tag.** Set or change the coding project (\"ethnographic corpus\") you're currently working on, as represented by its `ethno-*` Discourse tag. It is important :bangbang: to keep this setting up to date, as it enables collaborative coding. When set to any `ethno-*` value, the codename auto-complete list will suggest all codes used in that coding project, independent of code author. When set to the empty value, Open Ethnographer will use the default behavior of showing a user all the user's own codes, indepenent of coding project.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--5\">5. Using the API</h2>\n\nWe created an access protected custom API extension of the Discourse API that gives access to Open Ethnographer codes, annotations and ethical consent data. For the API documentation, refer to this topic:\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/using-the-edgeryders-eu-apis/7904\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--6\">6. Process for a whole coding project</h2>\n\nIn Edgeryders, we use [Discourse tags](/tags) to assign topics to Open Ethnographer projects. The presence of the project's own tag tells the ethnographer that that particular topic is part of her project. We also use these Discourse tags to filter topics via the Open Ethnographer APIs.\n\nThis system allows easy reuse. The same topic that is relevant to today's project could tomorrow also be used in another project. You can append as many tags as you want to the same topic, so there is no conflict. \n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--6-1\">6.1. Choosing a Discourse tag</h3>\n\nDiscourse tags that refer to ethnographic research projects with Open Ethnographer are named `ethno-{projectname}`, for example `ethno-opencare`.\n\nYou can choose the project name freely, it does not have to correspond to the name of an Edgeryders client project (as encoded in the different `project-{projectname}` tags).\n\nYou can also use the code `codepriority` to indicate to ethnographers what content you'd like coded first.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--6-2\">6.2. Assigning the tag to an entire category</h3>\n\nMost Open Ethnographer projects in Edgeryders are based on Discourse categories. For example, the OpenCare category is based on [several categories](https://edgeryders.eu/c/opencare). To assign a project tag to an entire category, do this:\n\n1. Navigate to the page of the category you want to monitor, for example https://edgeryders.eu/c/opencare/diy-and-open-source .\n\n2. \"Infinite scroll\" to the very last topic of the category, then scroll back up. This pre-loads every topic in the category into the browser's memory.\n\n3. Click on the \"bullet point list\" icon under the name of the category, to the left of \"Topic\":\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6c2e227be5fac6cbe8e0674fb199620fef71449b.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"288\"> \n\n4. Two buttons appear. Click on \"Select All\"\n\n5. A wrench icon appears to the extreme right of the page. Click it. \n\n6. From the menu that appears, choose \"Append Tags\"\n\n7. In the text box that appears, type the tag, for example  `ethno-opencare`\n\n8. Click the \"Append tags\" button. \n\nIf your project is based on more than one category, you will have to do this for every one of them.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--6-3\">6.3. Assigning the tag to a single topic</h3>\n\nSometimes an ethnographer or a community manager may find a topic that came out of a different project, but is happens to be relevant to the Open Ethnographer project at hand. For example, this is the case with several care-related projects coming to Edgeryders through the OpenVillage [People and Projects](https://edgeryders.eu/c/openvillage/people-projects) category. To make a single topic part of the project at hand, do this:\n\n1. Navigate to the topic page, for example [this one](https://edgeryders.eu/t/after-fab-life-event-about-makers-commitments-for-opencare/6537).\n\n2. Click on the pencil icon next to the title. A text box opens:\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a48df0fadf3e6b234bdad2fd16a0f3c409533664.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"328\">\n\n3. Click in the text box and start to type the project tag, for example `ethno-opencare`.\n\n4. Click on the :white_check_mark: icon\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--6-4\">6.4. Enabling collaborative coding</h3>\n\nOpen Ethnographer needs to know that you are now working on this new coding project, so it can propose you the codes used by anyone in that coding project (and exclude any others).\n\nFor that, choose the coding project's Discourse tag in the following Open Ethnographer user setting: User Settings \u2192 [your user] \u2192 Edit User Settings \u2192 Discourse tag\u201d.\n\n\n### <h2 id=\"heading--7\">7. Best-practice conventions for coding</h2>\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--7-1\">7.1. Big Picture</h3>\n\nWhen we are coding, we need to think about the rigour of the coding system so that others can easily understand and use our codes and the data structure we are producing in the SSNA. This means:\n\n- creating codes that carry meaning, are salient and are essence-capturing when viewed *on their own* \n- defining everything in enough detail and documenting why you chose to use a specific code \n- creating consistent and clear categories so that other ethnographers can easily navigate a large codebook\n- thinking about how someone who has never read any of the underlying data would read and understand the code if they saw it \n- thinking about what meaning the code will carry when it co-occurs with other codes in a visual network\n\n**Do code review after every coding session** and clean up your codes \u2014 make sure they fit the coding conventions both technically (in terms of case, invivo designation, etc) and semantically (that they aren\u2019t a synonym of existing codes, that they aren\u2019t compound codes, etc). We will save ourselves a lot of headache going forward if we do this while we work instead of trying to go through 1000s of codes retroactively.\n\n**Code descriptively.** When you code, don\u2019t just code for \u201ccontent\u201d. *If a machine could assign the same code as you\u2019re assigning, that\u2019s a good sign that you need to rethink how you\u2019re coding.* As an example of this distinction, ethnographers sometimes make the mistake of using invivo codes (where you use the same terminology as the participant) when the term itself isn\u2019t special, rather than thinking about what they mean and finding the right code to describe that meaning, in line with the codes you and your team have used previously if the concept has come up before. See your desire to automatically assign an invivo code as a red flag going forward, and ask yourself if you\u2019re using their exact word because it\u2019s the word that saliently captures the concept (and the one you\u2019ve been using thus far to capture that same concept) or because it\u2019s the easiest thing to do in the moment. We code for meaning \u2014 *what is the point of what this person is trying to say? What are they trying to get across? What values and worldview are they putting forward?*\n\n**Ask yourself: if the codes I assigned to this post or comment were assembled together by themselves, would the viewer be able to tell the story of what this person is thinking or feeling?** This means assigning more descriptive codes (like  `seeking purpose`  or  `defining justice`  or  `building inclusivity` ;  `access`  and  `education` ;  `complexity`  and  `asking experts` ) rather than codes like  `limiting`  or  `involvement` , which have no real meaning. This also helps you not overassign codes or create overly compound or vague codes. \n\n**Once you\u2019ve assigned a code for a concept, be consistent and stick with it** (or edit/update it across the entire corpus). The reason we call our *codebook an \u201contology\u201d is that it\u2019s more than a list of codes \u2014 it\u2019s a compendium of participant meaning.* If I call in-person human interaction  `face-to-face`  then I need to continue to use that phrase, rather than also assigning codes  `physical human interaction` ,  `real-life contact` , and so on.\n \n**Consistency requires being consistent with the co-occurrences you use to capture when people express the same sentiment** -- it goes beyond not assigning single codes with the same meaning. For example, imagine participants are expressing that they want to leave something material behind that outlives them, that lasts beyond their lifetime. If I use the connection between the codes  `built to last`  and  `legacy` , I need to not then also assign codes  `longevity`  and  `making one's mark`  or even  `longevity`  and  `legacy`  to a different story later in the month. Note that any of these combinations would be legitimate ways to capture this sentiment: you just have to pick one way of doing it and consistently apply it going forward. \n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--7-2\">7.2. Coding Conventions </h3>\n\n### Spelling and Formatting \n\nUse British spelling for English-language codes.\n\nUse lowercase letters (unless capitalised letter has semantic meaning, as in a proper noun).\n\nUse accented letters as normal in all languages.\n\n### Avoid compound codes \n\nBecause the SSNA detects co-occurrences, it is important that each code carries one meaning, that can then be linked to others. \nFor example, code `homosexuality` and `discrimination` rather than `homosexuality and discrimination` or  `homosexuality:discrimination`.\n\nAs @alberto aptly puts it: \n\n[quote=\"alberto, post:21, topic:13988\"]\n`homosexuality:discrimination` destroys the information that two *separate* experiences are mentioned in the same post. In SSNA, you are supposed to enter two separate codes, `homosexuality` and `discrimination` . The connection between the two is meant to be emergent: if (and only if) many posts mention both experiences, the semantic graph will show a strong connection. Formally, connections between experiences or concepts are represented by edges, not collapsed into nodes.\n\nThe advantage of coding thus is large. Somewhere else in the conversation you could have `discrimination` associated to something else, say `age` . The ego network of `discrimination` will then show you the various aspects of discrimination in the corpus. With double coding, you have to fall back on human memory to rebuild it. \u201cWait, did I not see discrimination elsewhere?\u201d With large corpora and several people coding, this problem becomes more severe. SSNA\u2019s main advantage is scalability, so it is essential to code for that. Your codes are no longer a memory aid for *you* , but a memory aid for the *collective effort* of several researchers plus a computer system.\n[/quote]\n\n### Specificity vs Generality\n\nIf the code does not carry any real meaning on its own (e.g. ` approaches` ), it is too general. \n\nIf the code is too granular to ever be reused (e.g. ` hyperactive mosquitos` ) then it is likely too specific. \n\nSometimes this requires creative thinking. If you're trying to capture the idea that informants are expressing that Romania is more awesome than Poland, the code ` Romania is more awesome than Poland` is likely not going to co-occur in many places (though @noemi might disagree :D ) . However, we could use the code ` country comparison` and co-code it with ` Romania`  and ` Poland`  (or ` Romania-Poland`  if we really felt strongly that we didn\u2019t want to lose that specific country comparison as tied to the country comparison code, though see why we should hesitate to do this in the compound codes section above. We could always go back and copy the code ` Romania-Poland` if we found it was too specific, assigning one instance of all the annotations to ` Romania`  and the other to ` Poland` , so no harm done as long as we keep that more broadly useful ` country comparison` there.)\n\n\n### How many codes to assign?\n\nIt is much easier to merge (and copy) codes than it is to fork them. As a result, aim for greater granularity and merge into a more general concept if you find upon review that the granularity is too small. \n\nIf we code everything ` discrimination`  and realise that we wish we'd coded ` homophobia`  and ` racism`  and ` sexism`  differently, we have to go back and re-read and recode all the annotations assigned to ` discrimination` . If instead we code the other three and decide they are too granular, merging them all into the code ` discrimination`  is easy. If we decide ` homophobia`  is occurring on its own broadly enough but the other two are too granular, we can always merge ` racism`  and ` sexism` into ` discrimination`  but leave ` homophobia`  alone. If we want all of the instances of ` homophobia`  to also be co-coded with the higher-level code ` discrimination` , we can easily copy the code ` homophobia` and merge that second instance into ` discrimination`  so that all its annotations are also coded with the code ` discrimination`. This is what we use hierarchies for in the backend, to more easily keep track of such concepts, as I will return to in the next section.\n\n\n### Code 'that which goes without saying'\n\nPart of our job as interpretive analysts is to use our sociocultural understandings and our training to read between the lines. If community members are talking about two concepts explicitly (say `remote working`  and ` e-learning` )  if ` Covid-19` is the context from which this conversation emerges, and the community members are clearly assuming that shared context in their conversations without stating it explicitly, be sure to code it. \n\nCulture is often termed 'that which goes without saying', and part of our job as ethnographers is to explicitly say it. This is especially important in the context of populism, where ` family values` ` traditionalism`  and ` housing policy` might be used to speak about something like ` homophobia` in subtext. \n\n### Code only what has *meaning*\n\nBack to ethnography as an interpretive method. One way not to overproliferate codes is to make sure that a code is only applied if the community member uses the concept *meaningfully*. \n\nFor example, if an event takes place in the United States, but the activities that happened at the event are not meaningfully connected to the fact that the event took place in the United States, in your interpretive assessment, do not apply that code. If, however, the fact that a certain activity happened in Prague (a major city) rather than a rural area, apply the code  `Prague `. Use SSNA thinking here: a co-occurrence network around cities might differ substantially to one around a rural area (certain ideas might be more widely held and repeated in the capital city than in a rural town, for example), which we would want to capture in the SSNA. Code with intention and interpretively. \n\nAs another example, a community member might mention that they are 50 years old. You would only apply the code  `age ` if age was a meaningful frame used by the community member -- if the story was about growing older and life changing, for example. But if the fact is incidental and they go on to talk about  `monster truck racing `, do not apply the code  `age `. \n\n### Three Tiered Invivo System\n\nIf a code is *descriptive* (your term for what informants are describing, or a word that is used in ordinary parlance to refer to the thing you are referring to), use unmarked text. Example: `sustainability` or ` mental health` \n\nIf a code is *invivo* (a directly quoted word or phrase that your informants used that is unique, interesting, or salient as a concept, or does not necessarily fit the 'normal' use of that word) use double quotation marks. Example: ` \"witch\"` , ` \"the East\"`, ` \"punk\"`  \n\nIf a code is *in-between* (a conceptual category used by informants that you are aggregating into a term yourself and/or that does not fit the dictionary or academic use of that term), use single quotes. Example: ` 'communism'` or ` 'patriotism'` \nReason: \n[quote=\"amelia, post:36, topic:13700\"]\nWe are tracing an emergence of codes that are somewhere in between invivo codes and strictly descriptive codes. These are conceptual categories used by informants that differ from the way the same categories are used in the political science literature. For example, @Jirka_Kocian is finding that his informants are using the category \u2018communism\u2019 in specific ways, but ways that differ from the definition as used by political scientists.\n\nThis framework will help us understand meaningful differences between informant conceptual categories (in and across language fora) and academic literature conceptual categories \u2013 and hopefully will let us start an analytical conversation with other partners, particularly the glossary deliverable.\n\n[/quote]\n\n### Hierarchies\n\n\nHierarchies do not appear in the SSNA itself, but we use them to enhance our ethnographic practice. Here are some ground rules. \n\n**Every code in a hierarchy must make sense on its own.** `Discrimination` could be the parent of `homophobia` or `sexism` , but creating a code like `approaches` and nesting it under `discrimination` is a no-go.  \n\n[quote=\"alberto, post:21, topic:13988\"]\n\n\n**Beware false hierarchies** . `Discrimination` is definitely not a child of `homosexuality` . Hierarchies are meant in a proper ontological sense: `cat` is a child of `mammal` , and `France` is a child of `Europe` .\n[/quote]\n\n**Use hierarchies to toggle specificity and generality.** \nLet's return to an example we used above. If we want all of the instances of ` homophobia`  to also be co-coded with the higher-level code ` discrimination` , we can easily copy the code ` homophobia` and merge that second instance into ` discrimination`  so that all its annotations are also coded with the code ` discrimination`. We might do this if we decide that discrimination as a code by itself would co-occur meaningfully with other codes in the SSNA. \n\nHowever, we don't want this to happen automatically, because excessively higher-level codes can end up dominating the graph too much, and may not carry enough meaning on their own to be represented (like `geographical location`, which is a useful organising category but not a very useful SSNA category). We use hierarchies in the backend for different purposes, and not all are worth representing in the SSNA. \n\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--7-3\">7.3. Codebook Structure </h3>\n\nThe codebook consists of a code + its definition (\"code description\" in the backend). \n\nYou can easily edit codenames and descriptions in [this view](https://bbu.world/annotator/codes?creator_id=9&view=translate):\n\n![Screenshot 2020-08-18 at 16.25.17|690x353](upload://lzRCnW8HR0SxCtzW4nErsnzGwCM.png) \n\nTo get here, click on \"Codes\" and then in the \"View\" drop-down in the top right corner, select \"Translate\" (the default is \"Tree\"). You can filter by project tag to select your project, and you can filter by name to select codes you have assigned. \n\nTo add definitions to the codes you assigned most recently, select \"Newest\" in the \"Sort By\" Dropdown. You can also use this view to review the codes assigned most recently by other ethnographers. \n\nFor now, to do code review, we can create a Discourse thread to discuss larger changes and leave comments with our initials in the code description field itself. You can also keep any memos about the code in the code description field. \n\nTo denote that a code needs review and to call attention to other ethnographers, add a * sign at the front of the code so it appears first in the code list. When you see that asterisk, resolve the comment that the other ethnographer has left and remove the comment as well as the asterisk.\n\n### Codebook Style Guide: \n\n* British English spelling and grammar conventions. \n* Code: lowercase unless a proper noun. This is very important as codes are case sensitive!\n* Definitions: initial letter is lower case unless it is a proper noun or name. Definitions end with a full stop.  \n* Mark in vivo terms using double quotes, mark conceptual categories (see \"three-tiered system\" above) in single quotes. \n\n### Document Everything\n\nDefine your codes immediately. \n\nDefine *every code*. I mean *everything*. Even if it seems self-evident. See above on saying \"what goes without saying\". This applies to our own frames as well -- what seems self-evident to one of us will not be self-evident to another one of us. \n\nAssign both English and source language translations in the backend, so the codes are connected. \n\nIf you're not sure about a term or code, note it down and explain why so that others can help you hone it / you can return and refine it. Add an asterisk so it's clear it needs work. \n\nCreate categories in your own codebook as often as possible to help you structure and streamline your codes. I recommend creating these as you code, or at least frequently, to avoid having to do this in a big batch. Doing so makes you less likely to assign different codes to the same concept and have to merge later, since you can see your existing codes more clearly. \n\n\n### Interacting with Other Ethnographers' Codes\n\nReview other ethnographers' codes frequently. Ideally every time you start coding, do a quick pass of what's been added since you last checked (using the Sort by: Newest function) . \n\nCheck if:\n* the code name accurately expresses the definition (is everything in the definition captured by the term used? Is there a more salient or accurate term for what the ethnographer is trying to express in the definition?)\n* the code is too general to carry meaning on its own\n* the code should be broken up into two separate codes \n* the definition/concept is already expressed by another code used in the codebook\n* the ethnographer has asked any questions that you can answer \n* the hierarchies and categories they use make sense\n\n*Merging codes.* If you think your code means the same thing as someone else\u2019s (or close enough that you should seek to align them), make a note of it in the related codes tab. Once you discuss the merge with the other ethnographer, merge the codes. Remember to check with the other ethnographer if you want to change the code or its definition.\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--7-4\">7.4. Thinking in network when coding: mapping coding to network structure </h3>\n\n\n### Basic concepts\n\nWhen you code with Open Ethnographer, you are implicitly arranging codes in a graph. The basic graph structure is something like this:\n\n![image|276x387](upload://imxDWHlpR3LHGKk2TjM0BUyC9CR)\n\nEntities in the graph are:\n\n1. authors (participants)\n2. their posts\n3. ethnographic annotations\n4. ethnographic codes.\n\nThe types of relationships involved are:\n\n1. Authors write posts.\n2. Posts may reply to other posts.\n3. Annotations annotate posts.\n4. Annotations invoke codes.\n\nThese relationships are fundamental: we cannot deduce them from the data, only create them when authors write posts, or ethnographers code them. But there are other types of relationships that we can deduce from the fundamental ones, through a technique called projection. The most important ones are:\n\n1. A *social* relationship between authors: author Alice is talking to (or engaging with) author Bob when Alice writes a post that is a reply to a post written by Bob.\n2. A *semantic* relationship between codes: code C1 co-occurs with C2 when there exist two annotations A1 and A2 where A1 invokes C1, A2 invokes C2, and A1 and A2 annotate the same post.\n\nIn the case above, these relationships do not appear. There is only one author, Alice, and only one code, C1. But imagine now the ethnographers creates a second annotation on the same post, and invokes a new code C2. Like this:\n\n![image](upload://64ZrKMvHRu7ToxSmBJqRHpV9WzB)\n\nNow, the codes co-occurrence network shows that C1 and C2 co-occur once, because they are both invoked by annotations to post P1. The number of co-occurrences is represented by the weight of the co-occurrences edge. The interaction network shows only Alice, interacting with no one.\n\nSuppose now that Alice\u2019s post was in fact a reply to a post written by Bob. The situation is now this:\n\n![image](upload://nYfAnu1QreSiHUokTCAaiRCTigd)\n\nWith no more annotations, the codes co-occurrence network is unchanged. But the interaction network now shows a link from Alice to Bob, symbolizing engagement. This edge, too, is weighted: the more replies Alice writes to Bob, the heavier the edge.\n\nEvery addition to the conversation database (authors writing posts, ethnographers adding annotations and codes) is encoded this way. So, you can think of coding as drawing networks. With every annotation, researchers using Open Ethnographer are adding nodes and edges to the conversation\u2019s semantic social network, more specifically to its semantic part, the codes co-occurrence network.\n\n## Multiple annotations on a single post induce a clique\n\nWhen a researcher adds an annotation to a post in OpenEthnographer, the code invoked by it will by construction co-occur with *all* the codes invoked by the other annotations on the same post. So, any post whose annotations invoke two or more codes gives rise to a *clique* of codes \u2013 a completely connected network, or part thereof. The number of edges in a clique depends on the number of nodes. In an undirected network like the codes co-occurrence network:\n\n* With 2 annotations, you get 1 co-occurrence edge.\n* With 3 annotations, you get 3 co-occurrence edges.\n* With 4 annotations, you get 3 co-occurrence edges.\n* With `n` annotations you get `(n * (n - 1)) / 2` edges.\n\nIf you visualize the full co-occurrences network (including edges of weight 1), rich posts are easy to spot as very dense cliques, often connected to the rest of the graph by only one or few codes:\n\n![image](upload://theK3EUz9tCBjLOHw89inlxaxz0)\n\n## Interpreting repeated co-occurrences\n\nWhen doing SSNA, i.e. the analysis of semantic social networks, you would not attribute a great deal of importance co-occurrence edges of weight 1. There are two reasons for this, one conceptual and one network-structural.\n\nThe conceptual reason is this. SSNA is a quest for *collective* intelligence. It aims to capture how *a group in conversation* , not a single individual or a collection thereof, see something. By construction, an edge of weight 1 in the codes co-occurrence graph means that the two codes in question occurred together in the same post only once; posts can only have one author, so only one individual has made that association explicitly, only once. This does not qualify as collective intelligence. When the same co-occurrence repeats itself across multiple posts, it is likely to encode an association supported by the collective. **We treat repeated co-occurrence as a signature of collective intelligence** .\n\nThe network-structural reason is that a rich post might well have 20 annotations with 20 different codes. This means 190 edges. The number of edges in the graph can easily become dominated by a few rich posts. There is no elegant solution for this.\n\nSome network scientists dealing with interconnected cliques like to assume that all cliques (not all edges) have the same weight, equal to 1. They, then, rescale the weight of the edges by the inverse of the number of edges therein. In our case, this would mean assuming each post has one \u201cvote\u201d to spend. If a post is annotated invoking four codes, each of its `4 * 3 / 2 = 6` edges would have weight 1/6. A post with only two codes invoked would give rise to a single edge of weight 1, and so on.\n\nWe do not consider this to be a good solution for online ethnography. A large number of annotations on a post tends to mean that that post is indeed very rich in meaning (and often longer than average). It is by no means clear that the connections across these codes would be of less value than those stemming from posts with only 2 or 3 codes.\n\nInstead, we filter out all one-off connections, and consider only the co-occurrences that appear at least *twice* in the corpus. This:\n\n* Anchors more firmly our claim that the codes co-occurrence network has something to do with collective intelligence.\n* Gets rid of the cliques.\n* Simplifies dramatically the graph: in our studies so far one-off co-occurrences make up about 90% of all co-occurrences.\n\n\nThe discussion on this Ethnographic Coding Wiki is treated in its own topic:\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/ethnographic-coding-wiki/13975/3\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--8\">8. Archiving ethnographic data</h2>\n\nFor properly archiving the results of online ethnographic research, Open Ethnographer data have to be transformed, packed together with relevant metadata and uploaded somewhere \"safe\".\n\nWhile we don't have this content fully developed and documented, here are some pointers to documentation about how this is being handled in our past and current projects involving Open Ethnographer:\n\n* **[Keeping POPREBEL stuff in order: a thread on where to store things, and why](/t/9361).** The closest to a manual section so far.

Contributing to development</h2>\n\nOpen Ethnographer is open source software and you're welcome to contribute:\n\n* **Code.** The code is hosted as project [edgeryders/annotator_store-gem](https://github.com/edgeryders/annotator_store-gem) on Github. (The repo name is legacy and will change soon; it comes from an unmaintained project that we forked and used as our base software.)\n\n* **Documentation.** [This document](/t/6811) that you're reading now is the documentation. It is provided as a wiki and you can edit it after opening an account on edgeryders.eu.\n\n* **Issue tracker.** Please contribute issue reports and feature requests in [the project's issue tracker](https://github.com/edgeryders/annotator_store-gem) on Github.\n\n* **Discussion forum.** If you have a feature request or idea but are not too sure about it and want to gather others' input about it first, you're welcome to do so in the [Software (SSNA) forum](/c/workspaces/software-ssna) category of our Discourse forum.\n\n* **Support forum.** If you need help with the installation or usage of Open Ethnographer, please post on the [Open Ethnographer Manual](/t/6811) topic of our Discourse forum \u2013 that is, simply comment below.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--9-1\">9.1. Vocabulary for issue reports and feature requests</h3>\n\n**Open Ethnographer**: the software as a whole used for coding. \n\n**Coding View**: the view in Open Ethnographer where you assign codes to text by highlighting sentences, accessed by clicking the \"Coding View\" link at the top of any post. \n![image|690x274](upload://9mwz9Ucx54vsnxNAwWpqcweIY4I.png) \n\n**Codebook**: List of codes in the backend. Can be viewed as a **list of codes**/ **tree**, which shows the codenames and hierarchies:\n\n![image|690x379](upload://qNbcddTPqBkAeveDiEXcO8vHqWT.png) \n\nor as a **translate** view which shows the codes and their definitions as editable:\n\n![image|690x190](upload://bikV7npYpQC2VcIeWzzdl0jyen6.png) \n\n**Annotation**: A snipped of text that has a code assigned to it. \n![image|690x267](upload://zzXvGscdR22n3eC89kmOAGwSoao.png) \n\n**Thread**: The original post on Edgeryders plus all the comments on it (thread title is called the **Topic**)\n\n**Post** is the original conversation-starting contribution, **comments** are the user replies to this post and to other comments. Note that Discourse treats these two the same for the purposes of the SSNA.\n\n**Discourse tag**: The tag (assigned at the top of any thread) that indicates what category the thread is in. E.g. \"ethno-ngi-forward\n![image|445x690](upload://nWYlHbOEHKYdNuSpBAWHWujYlDG.png) \n\n**Code suggestions list**: the list of codes that appears while you are coding in the coding view as possible suggestions to assign to text:\n\n![image|690x455](upload://lUbkRWqjYFlu5fouxVUgsC5XxID.png) \n\nAddendum: to make a code look like `this` in a post on Edgeryders, use a ` on either side of the word (usually found under the F1 key). \n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--10\">10. Getting ethnographic data onto the Edgeryders platform</h2>\n\nThere is an ideal process for eliciting contributions from community members (as posts and comments on the platform) so they can be coded by ethnographers and show up accurately in the SSNA. They are listed below in order from most to least ideal. \n\n1. Community member makes account on Edgeryders and posts their own story or comment under their own pseudonym.\n\n2. Someone creates an account for the community member and posts their story or comment on platform, with their permission.\n\n3. Another community member posts the story or comment using their own account but makes clear that these are another community members' views. \n\nFor audio-recorded events and interviews: \n(See the [Consent Process Manual](https://edgeryders.eu/t/consent-process-manual/11904) for the ethical framework) \n\n1. Each participant of the event creates an account and posts their inputs as comments (difficult, but ideal).\n\n2. ER member transcribes the audio event, creates different accounts to represent each speaker (with permission, and pseudonymised), and posts their contributions as separate contributions.\n\n3. ER member transcribes the audio event and ethnographers code that transcription. If possible, separate into different comments based upon topic (so it's not just one giant block of text).\n\n4. Ethnographer codes the event audio directly using the audio coding function described in Sections 3.3 and 3.4. This is not ideal unless the event is audiovisual and the visual elements are themselves significant (e.g. there is action going on besides just speakers talking, and that action is meaningful ethnographically).\n\nFor field notes and event notes:\n\n1. As much as possible, have participants themselves write their reflections on the platform by making an account and writing a post.\n\n2. Import ethnographer field notes as different posts and comments attached to pseudonym accounts based on different participants\u2019 contributions/reflections, to capture them as different people for SSNA.\n\n3. ER member (community manager, ethnographer) posts field and/or event notes to platform in text  form so they can be coded.", "created_at": "2017-08-26 23:04:35.615727", "updated_at": "2020-10-22 08:53:08.963885", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 8031, "wiki": true, "reads": 58, "score": 1035.6, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [79442, 78750, 40736, 79607], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 3729, 3904, 3811, 5, 3310], "is_private": false}, {"id": 34865, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 6811, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Thanks for this!

They tend to think about things using the metaphor of business: so, they often choose their partners on the basis of documents that are essentially business plans. However, projects like the unMonastery are not businesses, and they don't have business plans. So, we set out thinking about making instead a <strong>sustainability plan</strong>: something that plans over time and adds and subtracts values, like business plans; but it incorporates explicitly the stewardship value of we do,\u00a0<em>unlike</em>\u00a0business plans.\u00a0\n\nIn principle, this should be understandable for a funder (for example, it allows them to compute their beloved ROI), while still doing justice to what we want to do. It takes the form of a set of \"unSpreadsheets\". You can find an incomplete prototype <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvvWawrKpTaFdHhQTGk3WXYzR2ZSd0MzRXJSbVFEelE#gid=3\">here</a>, with mockup data relating to the unMonastery. It is incomplete because it only computes profit and loss, but not the financial (and unFinancial) values of the statement of financial positions.

Do you see headlines as a tool of promoting and informing about your projects and news in your own surrounding? Did you know that this was one of the major ideas driving the \\#countonme list?\n\n2. Is the form of the headlines, or their content, or anything else, the obstacle in both reading and sharing the news?\n\n3. Is there something you think should be changed, improved, abandoned here?\n\nYour feedback is very important to us in order to decide if our idea is worth giving it a longer try, or maybe it is rather a waste of our energy.\n\n//\u00a0\n\nNoemi's version:\n\n[CountOnMe headlines] Are Edgeryders really counting on you in the weeks ahead?\u00a0\n\nDear Anna, Bob, ..\n\nThanks for joining CountOnMe, a little experiment we're running at Edgeryders to help each other make projects shine and bring more bright minds together through a shared social media effort. We're one month away from the community annual event - Living On The Edge: The Stewardship (Lote) and it would be awesome if you decide to help out with this final push. Perhaps you're coming to Lote? Perhaps friends of yours are / should be in Matera, visit the unMonastery and meet fellow Edgeryders? The best time to show the team you can be really counted on is now.\n\nYou can start by sharing this today on twitter, facebook or any channel of your choice. Wording is up to you, but these are some examples:\n\n<em>post with key lote4 highlights (upcoming)</em>\n\nIf Lote isn't exactly your cup of tea, remember you can opt out by a simple reply to this email, no harm done.\u00a0\n\nIf you have your own project news to share with the world, send them in, also in a reply to this email.\n\nIf you have questions or feedback for the Countonme team, <a href=\"/t/countonme-headlines-lets-make-this-thing-better/3588\">this is the place</a> to share them.\u00a0\n\nSending much love,\n\nNoemi\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-09-22 07:21:54", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:20.079662", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 431, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22844, "user_id": 7, "topic_id": 1499, "post_number": 9, "raw": "Iran is a very big and populous country. There are nomads in Iran and educated, progressive people as well and then more conservative, traditional muslims. It really depends if you're in Yazd or in Tehran if you're allowed to go to a tea house, so there's a major difference within the country. But still there's this two faced world of the society. I found it very interesting that of all the questions my friend was asked about me (because men directed their questions to him, not me, even if it was about me) they usually asked about my education. Education gives power and the fact that at the same time Iranian women are oppressed in many ways, it's very accepted that they have to be well educated.\u00a0\n\nIt's not like women are oppressed in that sense they don't have any power or right to be educated, it's the social stigma around the simple fact that they are women. They have to cover themselves, the husband or the father traditionally does all the talking. Men were reluctant to hand me things, but would rather hand it to my male travelpartner first and then he was supposed to hand it to me. It's not necessarily a sign of oppression in their mind, but extreme respect for the man's, well, property of the woman. It's not always like that, it really depends on the family.\n\nWhile we get to know the progressive part of the Iranian population, there's no doubt a big part of Iranian women whose lives are very opressed, by society and religion. These women are not the ones that approached us on the street to say hi or are the ones living in London, Paris or Berlin, studying.\u00a0<img alt=\"Women from Masshad\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-W5qAbbtrXrI/TtKs_IWPNRI/AAAAAAAAEGY/H0J2psiduz8/s640/img_8152.jpg\" style=\"width: 320px; height: 240px; \">\n\nAbove is a picture from a friend of mine who was in Mashad.

Web-based systems, social networks and\n\nmulti-agent systems very often need these tools for working out consistent\n\nknowledge states, resolving conflicts and making decisions. ICCCI 2017 is\n\nthe 9th edition of the conference organized by the University of Cyprus and\n\nWroclaw University of Science and Technology in Poland, in cooperation with\n\nthe IEEE SMC Technical

This is because actually, science *does* run a decentralized approach. Anyone can dispute anyone else; scientific consensus forms when authoritative authors all (or close enough) agree. Authoritative authors are those who are quoted by other authors, who are themselves authoritative. Yes, it is recursive, but the recursion can be handled mathematically by the [Perron-Frobenius theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perron%E2%80%93Frobenius_theorem). Science is an \"eigendemocracy\". \n\nI quoted climate change, because the same eigendemocratic process invoked by Greenfield against the smart city powers the claims of climate scientists when they say that the debate on human-fueled climate change is conclusive, or at least as conclusive as it gets in science. \n\n[quote=\"RobvanKranenburg, post:7, topic:10036, full:true\"]\nOne that you will set up?\n[/quote]\n\nWe could think of setting it up together?

We held three strategic sessions (one for Ekoli and two for ReaGent), to determine our focus points for the coming year(s). We had been building plenty of science related content, activities and infrastructure since we started (2 years ago for ReaGent, just short of 1 year for Ekoli). We had been mainly acting on gut feel so far, but the time had come to evaluate and improve our actions. \n\nSeveral factors are the base of this: our rent will increase, we are growing and some aspects are professionalizing. The latter is particularly challenging in an environment where the people who need help the most, don\u2019t have financial means, and there is a mix of volunteer and paid work.\n\nI invited Filip Dani\u00ebls, a systems thinker and visualizer, to join us during the sessions and help make sense of the complexity we\u2019ve created in sharing resources between two organisations.\n\nFrom the sessions we\u2019ve learned that we\u2019re doing quite okay and are very aligned in terms of values. We did lack some collective vision and the practical details of implementation were not always aligned. Discussion on the latter topic ironed out the details and got us going on the right track again.\n\nWe had to think more economically than before. The costs to cover are substantial. Luckily, we have built so much content and expertise that can be exchanged for money somehow. The difficulty lies in the short term that it has to succeed, and the dependency on personal investment of a few people. Yet after simulations, it\u2019s looking feasible. It is tempting to draw conclusions about how to really, and resiliently run a community space like ours, but I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s time yet.\n\nAre there general takeaways for other projects? Can we generalize what we observed with our projects? Not so much. Doing these sessions is the most important takeaway. So is looking from different angles and thinking from the perspective of an ecosystem, rather than an individual project. \n\nIn the sessions for ReaGent, what is an advantage for Ekoli was considered a benefit for ReaGent and vice versa. It is interesting how dependencies and assistance evolve over time. Ekoli used to be dependent on ReaGent, but now it is evolving to be an equal relationship, or over slightly the other way around when it comes to paying the rent. This is sure to change in the future.\n\nWhat makes us able to do collaborate like this? Is it the fact that a big part of the team is active in both organisations? Is it the shared values? The shared space? Something else? I\u2019m not sure at this point, though the first point is probably the biggest factor. I\u2019m looking forward to future developments, where both organisations keep co-evolving through whatever ties them together. There are plans to formalize the link, as well as the links with other organisations that are heavily involved as our partners.\n\n#Open Insulin\n\nOpen Insulin powers on. Good progress is being made in Oakland and we have also started lab work in Ghent.\n\nIt is still clear that more time and effort by more people is needed, and that we need to invest in the habits and digital infrastructure to make it possible. Hence my trip to Oakland will be important to implement the digital infrastructure, and I\u2019ve been in touch with several team members there to prepare that. \n\nThere is a computational dimension of the project that is also very promising. It will involve the sharing and processing of scientific data by citizens all over the world, much like the celebrated Hubble telescope citizen science project. \n\nI\u2019m planning to travel to Cork to meet the team there in November, as they are starting their own Open Insulin efforts. With four groups globally, it is important to be on the same page and invest in synergies early on.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/bf1224f479e188198f0b4238571e09e4419cdc40.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"517\">\n\nThe lab work in Ghent took off, after a long search and waiting period due to logistics and legal constraints. We\u2019re now reproducing the experiments in E. coli bacteria and designing a new yeast genetic construct, which is in line with the direction that Oakland is taking. \n\nWe have been supported in a major way by a department at the University of Ghent, and the team of volunteers here is putting many hours into the project. I think a congratulations and thank you to everyone is in order, for hanging in there since we started a few months ago :-)\n\n#OpenVillage\n\nAfter an intense sprint in early summer, and a quieter period in August, the OpenVillage program is in its final forms and the communication efforts are ready to begin. It\u2019s been a hell of a ride, chaotic and a lot of work. Even though it\u2019s a while to the final party, it\u2019s already satisfying. Co-fellows @gehan and @woodbinehealth have pulled off some amazing work!\n\nOnwards, lots of work and travels around the world. Writing this from a friend\u2019s place in Bratislava, where I\u2019m away from everything to do some deep work. Then to Oakland for Open Insulin and a global DIYbio conference in September, where I\u2019ll be meeting community members who are working on similar things!

The focus is Collaboration (Technology) for freelancers*\n\nThe panel speakers were: [Matthew Mottola ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/matthew-mottola-will-join-for-a-triad-conversation-on-freelancing-tech-resilience/14480), [Dani Ifrim ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/dani-ifrim-will-join-for-a-triad-conversation-on-freelancing-tech-resilience/14584), [Nicole Gray ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/nicole-gray-will-join-for-a-triad-conversation-on-freelancing-tech-resilience/14536)\n\n# Collaboration over Competition\n\n [Matthew Mottola ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/matthew-mottola-will-join-for-a-triad-conversation-on-freelancing-tech-resilience/14480): **One can do it all - but that is just the start**\n\nWe started the conversation with a statement by Matthew Mottola (*Author of the book \"Human Cloud - How Today's Changemakers Use Artificial Intelligence and the Freelance Economy to Transform Work\" ( you can reach him here @matthewmottola)*) about what the big \"game changers\" in terms of freelancing technology have been up to this point. **\"Technology that enables individuals to do the work that has previously been done by whole companies\"** has enabled freelancers to run their own professional businesses without dedicated HR or accountant staff. He also pointed out tools for processing payments internationally and contract signing, which while less obvious than project management tools have had a huge impact on the development of the current freelancer economy.\nThe obvious project management tools have enabled freelancers to actually work with companies. \nMatthew sees the upcoming game-changers as tools that would enable freelancers to take on complex tasks and work together with other freelancers. \nIn regards to open source solutions, he does not think that companies/clients will ever buy into the co-ownership models that this would entail, or those solutions working at scale, but he sees the underlying ethos of open source as relevant for the development of freelancer to freelancer collaboration culture.\nHe ended up with the analysis that what would be needed next would be:\n 1. One platform for freelancers which gives them actual ownership over their information, so they are not forced to switch and stretch themselves thing across multiple platforms. This is actually what he is working on with his current project.\n2. Enabling the collaboration between multiple freelancers, going beyond this initial \"one person can do it all\" idea to one person can work with everyone.\n#\n\n[Dani Ifrim ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/dani-ifrim-will-join-for-a-triad-conversation-on-freelancing-tech-resilience/14584): **Learning what you want** \nDani Ifrim  (you can reach him here @Danifrim) addressed the realities of working as a freelancer in the creative industry. Certain tools are necessary in this field, for example from adobe creative suite, but he still sees a lot of movement in this context as the best program ends up to be the one used. In his opinion, in the creative field the biggest programmes are usually also the best, and he would wish for even better compatibility between the tools. \nDani, who is now working as a photographer and web developer, had originally an education in mechanical engineering. He stresses the amazing platforms that are available to learn skills online as you need them to develop yourself and your practice. **\"All that I learned, I learned from Youtube and Skillshare.\"**\nIn this phase, open-source programs are very relevant, but once a person professionalized they move towards the program that works best. There are a few examples, like Blender, where a developer commits both to opensource and best quality, but that is an exception. \n\n**\"Personally I feel very lucky to live in the time that I live. Maybe sometimes it is too overwhelming, but you just have to put in some work in analysing what suits you best and yes, just do it.\"** - Dani's optimistic and encouraging closing statement.\n\n#\n\n[Nicole Gray ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/nicole-gray-will-join-for-a-triad-conversation-on-freelancing-tech-resilience/14536): **Community and Communication**\nNicole Gray is the founder and facilitator of a community for freelancers. (You can contact here @bxdcomm).  She sees the main game-changer for her self and many of her community members to be \"notion\". \nThe challenge with each new piece of technology you use is the learning curve, which is why most people go to the big monopolies because they do not want to potentially sink the costs of learning a new piece of software. Personally here again she has had good experiences with the Notion, Gmail platforms and Slack, but Zoom turns out to be the most important as it enables face to face engagement.\nIn this time, a large number of people have been forced to change quickly from a tradition fulltime job into a freelance position. **\"What can help with this challenging transition can be a likeminded community.\"** She would call a good online community a tool in this sense as it is integral. She has observed that especially new freelancers enjoyed virtually coworking sessions in her community.\nFreelancers have to constantly test their messaging and communication their \"brand\" to develop.\nNicole stresses that building community is key.\n\n# \n\n### A thought experiment: \n**What would you wish into existence?**\n\n* Something solving the problem for document access, as all the tools currently are developed for company teams, not for multiple freelancers that have different levels of access. Data shows most freelancers waste half their time with admin work like requesting access.\n* A tool that merges different communication platforms like Messenger, Slack, email, Discord, WhatsApp etc. into one interface for you, collecting all the communications with each person and also allowing everyone to use the type of platform they want to use for technical or ethical reasons without having the freelancers \"communication application diet\" explode.\n* \"push a button and get working\" to share the access and tasks with everyone according to what they need to be doing, and alongside this for the system to keep a record of the skills, needs and your history with each collaborator.\n\n## Closing statement: **Collaboration over Competition**\nNicole formulated the closing statement **\"Collaboration over Competition\"** which was seconded by everyone. \nThis is a great jumping-off point to discuss the future development of freelancing and tech to enable collaboration between multiple freelancers.\n\nFreelancing has been on the rise over the last few years, but Covid has increased this development. This makes solving the challenges faced by freelancers not only more pressing but also more attractive.\n\n**So we ask:**\n\n*How could freelancer organise? What about freelancer unions? In different disciplines or even across?*\n\n**Which tool/service/platform would you \"wish into existence\", if you could, to improve your work as a freelancer?**", "created_at": "2020-10-29 15:34:50.003739", "updated_at": "2020-11-03 09:07:50.526418", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1131, "wiki": true, "reads": 15, "score": 88.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19022, "user_id": 2551, "topic_id": 6136, "post_number": 11, "raw": "<b>Again only a superficial comment by me</b>\n\nI like the color coding in general.\n\nAs you get more complex clusters following the edges with the eyes can be kind of difficult though. So here is one proposal to address that:\n\nThe color of the edge could be taken from the node it leads TO. So if you have an edge between a red node and a green node, you can just look at the color of the edge next to the node in question and train your eye approximately into the direction the edge is going and look for the right color (green).\n\nWhen your eye locks on a the green node you'll still remember that you just came from the red one, and so you know the edge next to the node you're looking at should be red. In effect this is like a color coded checksum.\n\nNext thing is that you could help the eye find the connecting node by having the edge only color coded along its outer 1/3rd (other fraction e.g. golden ratio may be better, dunno). Back to our example:\n\nYou come from a red node with a partially green edge. Your eyes can can easily get the length of the green portion of the edge - and mentally extrapolate it by a fixed factor (e.g. x2). That is the distance at which you start looking for the connected node in the network again. Everything clear? I should have made an image. :/\n\n", "created_at": "2017-02-28 17:35:48", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:46.038303", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 265, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [18166], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21260, "user_id": 3520, "topic_id": 530, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>display_matching_funding_services</b>\n\n<font color=\"#000000\" face=\"Calibri\">Hi @Noemi,</font>\n\n<font color=\"#000000\" face=\"Calibri\">for as much as I know primarily WEMI is matching a number of services available among the city organizations (providers) with citizens' needs.

Secondarily, City of Milan subsidizes up to 1,500 euros each to less affluent users (some 3mln euros have been pladged for 2017) to access services provided through the platform.

Participants made important points: we need to better support and acknowledge the Farmer; it is difficult to produce local food and set the prices right so that local or organic products are also affordable for the masses; and above all, the question arised: how can we make local food more widespread? and more generally, how can more capacity be built in rural areas?\n \nHere is what others are saying about the urban - rural gap and how we could support closing the gap.\n\n**Rural areas are not attractive, not vibrant. How could we have more farmers or do more farming?** \nThe first ideas were shared by Irene who talked about [\u2018neo-rurals\u2019 here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/registrations-poprebel-food-localisation-30-october-2020/14326/85), and this was mentioned again during the session on Food localisation. @lylycarrillo asked this too. @Vladb: You need to have more than farms in the rural areas. Services, but also entertainment. I don\u2019t want to drive one hour to have that. In order for young farmers to come to rural areas, you need to offer them more than just a plot of land. You need education tailored to students in each category.\n\n\n**The need to build new business models in rural farming**\n\n@FrankDieters, civil servant: In Holland, you have a big gap between large scale farmers (who have invested a lot in scale up) and the smaller community, they can\u2019t compete with the prices. We don\u2019t want to lose those farmers, they are more than food producers: they take care of the landscape, they produce also social value. You can\u2019t put that in money. Big companies come in, and they don\u2019t look at the value of the community. When the land is depleted, they go off to the next one.\n\n> I\u2019m thinking about the system change from within. What we do is we say: we\u2019re going to help those farmers. How is your farm doing? How is your business model built? What challenges are around you and how can we make that into a money maker for you? For example, if you have landscape elements we give you subsidies to keep them there. We are going to help you put innovative solutions in your companies, through subsidies, and also together with the banks.\n\n**How do members of the minority relate to farming? Is rural a point of divide if we think about nationalism?**\n\n@Dragan_Jonic: a few days ago we visited a community of young farmers [in Serbia]. Much of their land is earmarked for being repurposed into construction land, on which Rio Tinto will build tailings deposits. And the \u201elucky ones\u201d wil get a hefty reward which they don\u2019t want, while the others around will get only poison and pollution. I feel like not living in a European country.\n\n@Dubravka: I\u2019m half Serbian and half Croatian. Concerning my country, there is a problem of nationalism. But in the area of farming, I don\u2019t think you would have a problem.\n\n> The problem in Serbia is that young people are not interested in farming. The University and Dpt. of Agriculture has less and less students every year.\n\n@Paco21 : It starts getting very complicated when you have other economical issues. In Southern Europe, you have people coming from Morocco etc. during the harvesting. They are using the labor that is cheaper. The level is: how to produce at a very low cost. But you don\u2019t have that everywhere, and in Belgium you have to pay people higher salaries, so people are moving from Spain to Northern Europe for better income, and Moroccans move to Spain for the same reason. The backlash is then not a question of racism, but a more complex situation.\n\n**For someone considering a career in farming who is a minority, how are they welcomed in such rural communities ex: in Poland or Serbia? Is it different from in the cities?**\n\n@Dragan_Jonic: A few years ago, we tried to engage some young refugees from Pakistan and Afghanistan passing through Serbia in urban farming (garden community \u201eBa\u0161tali\u0161te\u201d near Belgrade). With not much success, unfortunately. They came twice and left, their mentor should\u2019ve worked harder on their motivation. I mean, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t understand them. They didn\u2019t come from farming communities, couldn\u2019t recognise plants. It needed a lot of work. Not to mention mosquitoes and hauling canisters of water.\n> \n> We speak digital and most farmers in Serbia think analogue. Footwork, footwork, footwork and empathy. At least in my country, that\u2019s the only way. We\u2019re establishing informal networks, too - between the end users and farmers\n\n@JohnCoate: how much migrant labor is used in Europe? For example, California depends on it. @jasen_lakic: A lot of Eastern Europeans work in France, Germany etc...they come as seasonal workers. @Wolha: For example Ukrainian workers are picking up strawberries in Poland\n\n**'Human potential is a huge problem'. What can citizens do themselves?**\n\nJasen: Human potential is a huge problem, right now migration reached such a bad point in many Croatian regions that it is hard to start a rural business...no workers are even available.\n\n@MariaEuler: My great uncle is a farmer in Germany, so were my grandparents. My great uncle had to transfer the farm to his 20 year old son because they needed the support that was given in subsidies to young farmers. Family structures can get important and complicated via this. Does not necessarily fit with modern family structures and live plans, people have to make decisions early to keep their family farms alive. On a neighbouring farm the daughter who works on the farm has split from her husband, but he is part of the farm and can not be paid out, so they need to keep working together. Anachronistic structures develop this way (this is in rural Germany).\n\nJasen: We fought 2 years to have roads built, electricity and water connected to 3 remote villages near mine in Croatia...\n\n> the problem is \"there are no people, so how to justify the investment\". How do we bring people without the infrastructure?\n\nDragan: In Serbia, not much of public incentives for young people to come back. On the other hand, some *are* returning, but because of something else. Because of environmental protests in the area. Maria: Maybe a problem for the coming back and using support for young people is also that investments do not necessarily grow and be paid out again afterwards, so decisions need to be final. While a flat or business in a urban area can easier be sold of and refinanced again. Their idea of committing early to a long-term life plan is hard for young people today.\n\n\n**There is a relationship between citizen engagement, citizen empowerment on different levels which expands the space for what can be done to make rural living more viable and attractive**\n\nNadia: Informal decentralised approaches towards these communities is crucial. Frank: the empowerment, engagement and reconstruction of a relations. Jasen: Yes, the human potential is everything and can take care of most issues locally. I believe a big part of return to rural areas would be change in understanding that not everyone in rural areas needs to be a farmer...we can transform the countryside really. Dragan: Decentralisation as a strategy for tackling dysfunctional political systems/ corruption. In Serbia it worked. Mobilise people within 30 minutes. Nadia: This could be interesting thing to look at also, communication infrastructure that is resilient and autonomous.\n\n### Ongoing conversations you can join before the session on 23 November:\n\n* https://edgeryders.eu/t/sustainable-development-focus-on-rural-areas-and-food-localisation/14736\n\n* https://edgeryders.eu/t/documentation-what-we-are-learning-about-local-food-and-what-makes-rural-farming-so-difficult/14704/6\n\n### How is the event financed?\n\nThis event is part of the POPREBEL initiative, funded by the European Commission under grant agreement number 822682 from 2019-2021.

As stated before, the general themes of the festival (Open Science, Architectures of Love, and Revolutionary Care) will be woven throughout the festival.  \n\nDay 1 will be an introduction to the general themes, as well as a way to present some theoretical views of care.  This process will allow us to ease into the conversations and the urban game will be a way to loosen our bodies and our minds with each other.  \n\nDay 2 will focus more on the practical.  It will highlight ways that projects have taken the theoretical and developed them into daily practices and infrastructures.  \n\nDay 3 will focus on the visionary.  It will be a combination of introduction to the OpenVillage projects, but also looking at the process of other collectives around creating community.  Overall, we aim for it to be a capstone conversation to the previous two days.  How do we create the structures of care needed in our local worlds while also creating the tangible villages to experiment?  We will use the MENA project as an experimental space to visualize the logistics as well envision the dreams of a new world, a world capable of answering the pressing catastrophe around us.  We hope all participants stay for Day 3 and that you bring your most creative and visionary selves to the process.  We will need all of you to make it work!\n\nAs we continue to develop the program, we ask all participants and presenters to have patience with us!  While we want to give everyone the time to present formally, there may be some changes to the formal presentation schedule.  But Day 3 will be left more informal and we desire that folks feel empowered to present their work in small groups.  Also, if you do have work that you feel encouraged to present informally, we hope that it can be included in Day 3.  Lastly, if there are still formal proposals for sessions, please post them on the blog!  It will always be helpful for the larger community to hear about your work and there is no telling how many other projects you can inspire!  We will plan on having a formalized schedule by September 15th.  So please continue sharing and participating.  We hope to see you all in Brussels!  \n\nFestival Curators", "created_at": "2017-08-31 22:04:16.893474", "updated_at": "2017-09-19 14:02:48.250912", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 429, "wiki": false, "reads": 21, "score": 294.2, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3362, 3613, 3, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 35374, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 6868, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Hi @Marwa-Adam, does your cafe exist already or is it a concept you are working on?\n\nI am not sure I understand the connection between what seem to be your key objectives: raise awareness about waste, provide art trainings and grow entrepreneurs?

That's not realistic if we want modern comforts; at the household level, the best we could get would be the very simple tools you could find in a farm in the hinterlands of Nepal. So in [my proposed system](https://ma.juii.net/blog/earthos-0-13), which is incidentally called EarthOS :D , there are these levels, each with more autarky but less mobility than the previous, and each made of multiple instances of the previous level of equipment and organization, and then some more on top:\n\n* L1 (infrastructure)\n* L2 (individual)\n* L3 (household)\n* L4 (village or commune)\n* L5 (shipstead)\n* L6 (floating city)\n\n[quote=\"steph, post:65, topic:14773\"]despite its history of exploitation, global trade was also responsible for the mixing of cultures and exchange of ideas\u2014enabling the (eventual) acceptance of diversity. [\u2026] how might we continue to foster diversity in such a future, if the shape of global trade must change?[/quote]\n\nThat's a good point, and my guess is that online collaboration will be the first half of the solution. As in, \"Globalize information, localize everything else.\" I a solarpunk world, this can work very well for physical items as well, as collaborating on the blueprints of open source machines can well be done over the Internet. A good example of how this could look in practice is [Snappy](https://github.com/revarbat/snappy-reprap/wiki/v3.0-Rendering), \"the world's most 3D printable 3D printer\". Open source collaboration on mechanical 3D models has been a challenge, but this project shows what can be done with when really pushing existing open source tools \u2013 in this case, it's pushing [OpenSCAD](https://www.openscad.org/), \"the programmer's 3D CAD\", where 3D models are coded and not drawn.\n\nThe second half of the solution could be the organized medium-term exchange of people, similar to traveling monks in earlier times.

Please update this wiki with content old and new from your respective projects today:\u00a0<a href=\"/en/agora/draft-community-news-23-06-2015\">https://edgeryders.eu/en/agora/draft-community-news-23-06-2015</a>\n\n2. <strong>Step two is producing status updates that catch people's attention on social media and draw them in</strong>to the page to read and engage with the content. The trick I often use is to copy paste what I have already posted on FB or Twitter from my personal accounts into the shared calendar :) Please update the social media calendar with engaging headlines here:\u00a0<a href=\"/t/edgeryders-news-calendar-april-to-december-2015/4277\">https://edgeryders.eu/en/agora/edgeryders-news-calendar-april-to-december-2015</a>\n\n3. <strong>Step three is engaging more people to help by spreading the news with us.</strong> Join and count on me list and engcourage others to do the same?\u00a0<a href=\"/t/kickstarting-the-countonme-digest-with-community-news-headlines-whos-in/3270\">https://edgeryders.eu/kickstarting-the-countonme-digest-with-community-news-headlines-whos</a>\n\nThe more people who do the above, the more effective and fun our social media outreach will be. A kind of drumbeat that helps us find one another and dance together :)\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-22 09:53:39", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:25.922422", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 410, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26370, "user_id": 61, "topic_id": 2070, "post_number": 13, "raw": "<b>ahh our archives system?</b>\n\ngood question Ariane:\n\nWhat might be even more fun is The Lore of the unMonastery. \u00a0An ongoing exploration that vanished from view somewhere in our cloudy past. \u00a0Edgeryders seems to me more prosaic and anarchistic - it is a home for everyone. \u00a0It is with the unMo that we start to enter each others lives and explorations.

And we discussed on how to make this need work well and be useful in Jenin's context.\n\nThe coworking became a center for arts and crafts where to develop with craftsman, chefs, people, artists and farmers different projects which have something to do with sustainability in order to engage local community and offer Life possibilities in one hand, and reach the outside international community in the other by hosting tourists and interational residencies.\n\nThe space would consist in a workspace for arts, manual works and kitchen - with a farm and contacts with farmers around.  There would be a public restaurant and an hostel for tourists and people who make residencies - which would bring funding to the entire project.\n\nTge approach would be permacultural, solar energy, zero waste, bio architecture.\n\nAnother way to fund it would be the possibility to make a festival im Bethlehem with market of artifacts and cooked recipes from the project.\n\nAll the products, recipes, and the project would be shown online to interest the international community and licensed under Creative Commons licenses.\n\nHope the idea could florish. We can continue to talk about it.

Through such stories, we aim to connect people with each other in an engaging conversation where they can be heard, feel supported by others, and learn new or interesting ways in which to look at the future. \n\nBelow is a set of exemplary stories. Why are they good? First, they are stories told by the people who lived them. Second, they explain in detail the social/economic/political contexts in which the authors live. Thirdly, they invite questions and generate conversations: other community members find them interesting enough to ask something, or offer their own experience on the topic!\n\nFrom Poland:\n- [An educated view of why Kaczy\u0144ski is so appealing to people](https://edgeryders.eu/t/kaczynski-upomnial-sie-o-przecietnego-kowalskiego/10143): Pepe relates his own political views in a respectful and argumented manner, and details his personal experiences in a way that can build empathy even with people who are ideologically very different.  \n- https://edgeryders.eu/t/the-underground-state-of-women/760 - a compelling story from 2016 about the illegal and grey market for abortions in Poland.\n- [The difficulties of being an entrepreneur in Poland](https://edgeryders.eu/t/prowadzenie-jednoosobowej-dzialalnosci-gospodarczej-w-polsce/10049): Marta explains how as a young business owner she had to return to full time work, because in Poland it is difficult to be an entrepreneur.\n- [The story of Aska](https://edgeryders.eu/t/diagnoza-wsparcie-psychologiczne-i-zycie-z-choroba-przewlekla-w-polsce/10046), a 25 year old who was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and the injustices that she saw in the health care system.\n- [Why I became a sex educator](https://edgeryders.eu/t/dlaczego-zostalam-edukatorka-seksualna/9857) - a young feminist who early on in life identified a lot of barriers in her community/ country culture.

Plus 400 Eur budget/ country for helping to prepare and participate the public online meetings/discussions.\n\n<hr>\n\n\n**Question:**  From the topics you have sent (mental wellbeing, work and prosperity, health) I got an impression that the interviews are not supposed to by focused on political postures of the respondents, right? It seems to me we are going to be talking more about the current crisis and possible solutions of it, right? \n\n**Answer:** Yes and no. We would like to start by better understand the current situation and context within which people are living right now. What is their understanding of the issues that they care about/ affect them. And how they connect this with politics/ their relationship to the contemporary political landscape. Rather than start with hearing or discussing political opinions or positions per se as a starting point.\n\n<hr>\n\n**Question:** Are there any criteria for the respondents (regarding age, income group or region they live)?

(@noemi could you add a blurb here?)  \n* In order to improve the world we are living in\n* is willing to share his story with other members of edgeryders forum.*\n* Er forum is ( also @noemi ,can you add short description appropriate for the context here?) \n\n<hr>\n\n**Question**: Does the respondent have a duty to discuss in the forum, or is he/she only responsible for publishing the story and that is the end of his responsibility? \n\n**Answer:** We do wish to encourage a dialogue between participants on the platform. It is best if the person is interested publishing the story and answering some questions or comments that others ask about his or her story.\n\n<hr>\n\n**Question:** Can the respondent remain anonymous or use a nickname? Do we need any other data about him?\n**Answer:** Yes, absolutely -  They just need an email address to create an account and can use an alias.\n\n<hr>\n\n**Question:** Do my duties include any other activity besides delivering the story and the summary ( weekly meetings, promotion of stories, any activity related to the book)? And each story needs a summary, right?\n\n**Answer:** There are 17 stories, each with a short summary added to it and the activities mentioned above. But we also ask for 3 stories that are your own reflections on what has been said by the respondents, and the discussions that they generate. The purpose here is to understand what deeper understanding you, and we get from these conversations - and what lessons this gives us on how we can nurture a healthy political future in your country and perhaps in Europe as a whole.\n\n<hr>\n\n**Question:** Is there any travel budget?\n**Answer:** There is, we will need an estimate at the beginning of the work and the expenses have to be requested and approved by the Edgeryders managing team *before* the costs are incurred.\n\n<hr>", "created_at": "2020-11-23 10:33:12.529227", "updated_at": "2020-12-10 06:36:58.457509", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1974, "wiki": true, "reads": 10, "score": 32.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [6670], "is_private": false}, {"id": 41381, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 7920, "post_number": 24, "raw": "cool, just checking :) all good", "created_at": "2018-01-22 17:35:37.495472", "updated_at": "2018-01-22 17:35:37.495472", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 5, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 6.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [41380], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 72893, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 13021, "post_number": 1, "raw": "We have now installed the [Kanban Board](https://meta.discourse.org/t/118164) theme component here on edgeryders.eu.\n\nSo far, it is enabled only for the \"[OCI Lab \u2192 Workspace](https://edgeryders.eu/c/ocilab/workspace)\" and shown when clicking on the \"Board\" tab after visiting that category's page.

It could be in a bigger city with existing social entrepreneurs and activism ecosystem. It could be done with a partnership with an established social organization deeply rooted (workers union, youth organization...) - think platform strategy.\n\nThe roadmap and agenda seems for me ambitious. What are the action plan to collect social entrepreneurship projects, coach them, and recruit them? It's a fulltime job... Especially cause EdgeRyders is not a famous organization. Worst, it could be seen as another European NGO funders (=they give us money if we tell them what they love to hear and produce some reports).\n\nI think that EdgeRyders should have a clever communication plan to sell the \"sustainable social start-up incubator\" idea even if it's not really an incubator.
