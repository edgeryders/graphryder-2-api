In the giant component (there are several small ones too, not shown in the picture), one single edge `personal data <=> privacy` connects two otherwise fully autonomous clusters. The left cluster seems to be about economic sustainability, business models and their social consequences. The right cluster is more concerned with values and the public sphere.\n\nCould this be a promising way of reading the data?\n[/quote]\n\nPotentially. Although I think... that the fact that big tech and privacy are on different sides of this might complicate my answer, because I think as we continue to code, big tech and facebook will creep over to the privacy and surveillance side of the graph, potentially disturbing this dichotomy. \n\nIt's also interesting to trace `privacy` as a code in general, because it's making us connect two things we often consider separate --- privacy on the internet and privacy in real life. I think we are going to end up writing something incredibly interesting on the way that people configure notions of privacy, how it relates to private and public space, and what kind of 'space' the internet is. Privacy and autonomy also connect to building communities, both offline and online. \n\nI actually think @matthias' post on work-life balance vs work-life integration is going to be super interesting as a way in to thinking about this --- there's already great research on the disappearance of work-life separation, mediated by the dissolution of public-private boundaries enabled by the internet, and this is way pre-covid. \n\nThe great thing about anthropology is that it doesn't take these changes as negative (just like @matthias, who sees it as enabling him to live his life in a more integrated way that matches his own personal rhythm). The way this interfaces with living and working with others, tacking between `autonomy` and ` shared space`, `sense of community` I think is going to be absolutely fascinating. I also love the connections with `imagining the future` and `building alternatives`... the next generation internet is about more than just the online world, for sure, and I think what we bring to bear on it is this question of what it does to communities, how we make them, and how we imagine other worlds together, through our everyday practices.", "created_at": "2020-10-05 10:21:50.471456", "updated_at": "2020-10-05 10:38:56.522136", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 398, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 36.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [83920], "is_reply_to": [83920], "is_liked_by": [5, 5479], "is_private": false}, {"id": 75872, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 13296, "post_number": 32, "raw": "RedHat is a good example because the OS is public domain and what you pay for is their support.", "created_at": "2020-05-06 16:58:55.754321", "updated_at": "2020-05-06 16:58:55.754321", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 19, "wiki": false, "reads": 23, "score": 29.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [74995], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 43844, "user_id": 4363, "topic_id": 8462, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Hi Guillaume,\n\nI especially like the second pic, the fume!

What are you working on and why are you on the Internet Days?**\n\nI am the CEO of a cloud hosting platform called Atomia.\nI am at the internet days because it is probably Sweden  most well-known and perhaps best-visited general IT conference.\n\nI am not a founder of the company, but I was initially recruited as a salesman and since then I have been promoted. So what interests me about this is\u2026 IT in general and above all, cloud hosting. You can, with only small resources, do a lot. You can build something that is big, well-used and that is fun and interesting with very little ... There is a lot of technology to use and take advantage of and is created new. You can work with open source products and can contribute to that in the future.\n\nOur platform itself is not open source. It is a paid platform, but it uses lots of open source components and parts of the platform we have released open source and tried to build community. Relative success. Not easy to build successful open source products.\n\n**When did you last become hopeful or happy about the internet or its future?**\n\nThe other day someone told me that wikimedia foundation, those behind wikipedia, are planning, or are thinking abour starting a social network. A competitor to facebook, twitter and the rest.\n\nI think wikipedia is one of the best products on the internet. Hands down. So if they could replicate that success and create an ad-free open source, community driven network it would be nice. I don't like the ones that exist now.\n\nIt was the last time I became hopeful. Then, every time the internet is used for righteous protests, it becomes hopeful to reinforce and improve freedom of expression and information sharing. Every time someone does an open source project that can be used by anyone. You get happy with the internet if you turn off your notifications.\n\n**When did the internet or its development make you angry, scared or worried?**\n\nHere's how: The development of the Internet is a major contributor to AI's development. It is a fact.\n\nAI and facial recognition and other types of automatic identification and classification of humans are damn unpleasant. Of course, it can be used well by the police and the judiciary in a good way, but it will and is already about to be used in extremely unpleasant ways. Read somewhere on a forum that 1984 was not supposed to be a manual.\n\nIt is uncomfortable when such dystopian fantasies are made technically possible. It's not so fun. Then it is obviously unpleasant with all false information being disseminated. It is even more unpleasant the harder it becomes to identify what is false, the better those who spread become at making it look real.

More specifically we were interested in looking at 3 alternative ways of achieiving more impact: \u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Pooling and sharing resources, e.g via collaborating around big\u00a0crowdfunding drives</li>\n\n<li>Coordinating campaigns around common themes, e.g for engaging policymakers on certain issues</li>\n\n<li>Helping each other scale as well as deal with \u00a0the consequences of scale and fast growth, e.g. though pooling efforts to upskill community members so they can take more individual responsibility.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nToday @Maxlath shared the video of the discussion:\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/ACiLdi6tuFs\n\n\u00a0\n\nAfter watching it and I was again reminded\u00a0that the underlying question is really relevant for supporting one another to\u00a0get\u00a0more projects like the unMonastery off the ground. So how do we\u00a0better coordinate some activities in the our online communities\u00a0to support our community members and help increase the impact of their work? I believe in learning by doing and would like to invite others into trying to do something concrete together, documenting our efforst\u00a0and sharing what we learn.\n\nAre you interested in the topic?

Because I don\u2019t want my date in a place that\u2019s not my own.\n\nI can connect to the VPN server on my virtual server via raspberry pi, computer and phone. The reason for this is that he doesn\u2019t have a steady IP at home.\n\nHe also did not want to have his NextCloud publicly available.\n\nNextCloud is a suite for hosting. It\u2019s like google drive and contacts and calendar and it\u2019s open source.\n\nHow configurable is it to use NextCloud?\n\nNextCloud is really slow on Raspberry Pi, takes like 2 sec to load a page. He only uses the desktop service, not the browser version.\n\nThere are multiple ways of running things that you want to just run in the background. A common way of doing this on a Linux machine is to just run \u201cSystem CTL\u201d.\n\nHow do you run stuff that doesn\u2019t end when ssh ends?\n\nSomething with T-mugs[t-mux], which was not a good idea apparently.\n\nInstead he\u2019s doing something with SNAP, which can install software packages, in a contained way since they don\u2019t effect the rest of the system.\n\nDocker is a framework for building and running and managing containers.\n\nA cointainer contains a program so it can run the way it needs without interacting with the rest of the system\n\nKeks doesn\u2019t like managing servers, that\u2019s why he works on SSB\n\nThere\u2019s a good tutorial on how to make a NAS based on raspberry pi.\n\nThe only reason people use cloud services is because they want their data to synch. Why not just synch the data itself, such as with NextCloud or with Ssb/DAT\n\nIs it not possisible to set up DAT on my computer and a raspberry pi or something to use it as a NAS?\n\nYes, it\u2019s doable. But it probably works most of the time. Is that enough?\n\nThat\u2019s the main problem with peer-to-peer stuff, it\u2019s not always working?\n\nWhy can I not run it on IPFS?\nEverytime you change any kind of data the ID of the data hcanges so then you have to synchronize the data changes. So then you also end up having the same problem as with DAT, the two computers don\u2019t find each other.\n\nI heard hosting email yourself is really difficult?\n\nSending is really tricky.

As someone who might show up as a playwright / writer in need of many hours working alone (that's the nature of the beast), I can only rely on some earlier experiences. I have been to the Ragdale Foundation in Lake Forest, Illinois, a half-dozen times for residences. It is a historic house located on the edge of parkland in a upper-upper-middle-class town, the veritable suburban Parioli of Chicago. In Lake Forest, the artists and writers are accepted (sort of) because, in the United States, artists and writers have no economic or political power. So it's a bunch of fairly harmless eccentrics (with the occasional best-selling novelist) living in some historic houses among captains of industry and the One Percent. In Spain, I was at Can Serrat, in Bruc, at the edge of Barcelona. Again, mainly painters and artists, although the people who run Can Serrat tended to be better integrated into the community of Bruc. (Their children were in the local schools, for instance.)\u00a0\n\nAll that written, my point is that Matera is in Italy, where writers and artists have been working successfully for centuries. Why, even back to the Samnites and Greeks. So the people of Matera undoubtedly know what they would like in becoming sponsors of such an institution. It is a matter of having them say so. Further, because the arts are firmly entrenched in Italian culture, the question becomes: What can artists do to benefit Materia meaningfully? A gallery show? A talk? Help with translating the information about those amazing cisterns? (A yearly sacrifice of an artist to the gods who live in the cistern? Hmmmm, that may be a viable option.)\u00a0\n\nI have never had much difficulty among Italians with people making it clear what they want in such situations. I'm sure that the people of Matera, too, have no \"pelle sulla lingua.\" \u00a0\n\nAll that written, I am aware that Alberto's charge is to consider socio-economic value of the arts. So the question may turn on best economic integration: Single building (to \"restrutturare\")? Dispersed residences? Designated community-based projects from people who want to interact with the community? Or is the best use just giving artists, writers, activists time and space among the people of Matera?\n\n", "created_at": "2012-10-23 13:20:08", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:59.209191", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 397, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 73238, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 13023, "post_number": 9, "raw": "[quote=\"noemi, post:8, topic:13023\"]\nit really depends on having a connected group of people\n[/quote]\n\n Well, at the small scale of the prototype that was not necessary.

Eher habe ich mich mit Hacking Utopia besch\u00e4ftigt. Also was w\u00e4re ein Utopia und wie k\u00f6nnte man das Hacken? Also wie k\u00f6nnte man Utopien entwickeln.\n\nPflege ist f\u00fcr jemanden da zu sein. Wohlwollend f\u00fcr jemanden da zu sein, wohlwollend auf jemanden einzuwirken. Ein sehr pers\u00f6nliches Bsp. W\u00e4re von meinen Gro\u00dfeltern. Mein Opa ist an Alzheimer erkrankt. Das hat sich \u00fcber drei oder vier Jahre hingezogen. Meine Mutter wollte es so stemmen, dass sie zuhause bleiben und nicht ins Altersheim kommt. Und Pflegebed\u00fcrftig bedeutet Macht abzugeben. Und pflege hei\u00dft in diesem Fall abrufbar zu sein und so zu priorisieren, dass sich alles um die eine Person dreht.\n\nManchmal bedeutet, dass Oma Nachts mit Taschenlampe einzusammeln. Oder Situationen im Haushalt, wo sie den Herd einfach angelassen hat und etwas Feuer f\u00e4ngt.\n\nIch wei\u00df nicht, ob ich das gut einsch\u00e4tzen kann, inwiefern es mein Leben beeinflusst hat. Ich war ja relativ jung, als es mein Leben beeinflusst hat. Wir sind bei den Gro\u00dfeltern eingezogen. Meine Mutter fand das gut, dass ich auf dem Land aufwachsen konnte und ich als Kind versorgt wurde. Und dann sind die Gro\u00dfeltern \u00e4lter geworden. Mein Opa ist gestorben und meine Oma demenzkrank geworden.\n\nDer Pflegebegriff, den ich mit dem Alter verbinde ist nochmal ein anderer als der von Kindern. Aber beide Arten von Pflege \u2013 also Pflege generell ist mit Liebe verbunden. Meine Mutter hat mich geliebt, genauso wie sie ihre Eltern geliebt hat. Diese Liebe gibt einem auch Kraft und die braucht man auch. Sonst ist das ja schwer zu stemmen. In unserem System wird das Verh\u00e4ltnis dann durch Geld kompensiert. Aber da sieht man ja auch, dass es M\u00e4ngel gibt. Da sieht man z.B., dass Pfleger die Zeit sehr eng sehen \u2013 sie sind f\u00fcr 10 min. da und nicht l\u00e4nger. Und dieses schnell-schnell homediensten oder Karitas, das sehe ich auch bei uns im Dorf. Da sind mal \u00e4ltere Leute und da kommt ein Auto vorbeigehuscht und das steht dann mal da f\u00fcr 10 min. und ist dann wieder weg. Da stehen gr\u00f6\u00dfere Unternehmen dahinter, da geht es um Jobs, da geht es um Geld. Die haben ihren durchgetakteten Plan.\n\nDer Begriff \u201ePflege\u201c ist der gleiche nur der Inhalt ist anders. Der Glaube \u2013 also nicht im religi\u00f6sen Sinne \u2013 der Glaube daran, dass die Person es doch noch alles mitbekommt, was um sie passiert ist auch wichtig. Man denkt ja, dass solche Personen gar nichts mehr mitbekommen. Und da hatten wir auch Gl\u00fcck. Wir haben eine Pflegerin \u00fcber das Internet gefunden, die meine Oma schon im fr\u00fchen Stadium kennengelernt hatte. Und ich habe gemerkt, dass sie sich gut verstehen, als sie meine Oma zum Lachen gebracht hatte. Das darf man auch nicht untersch\u00e4tzen. Meine Oma hatte auch sehr helle Tage. Aber das war alles sehr abrupt. Pl\u00f6tzlich hat sie nicht mehr reagiert. Und ich w\u00fcrde es daran messen, dass die Pflegerin mit meiner Oma wirklich Scherze machen konnte.\n\nAls ich meine Oma in der Situation im Schnee reinholen musste, als sie dachte, dass sie Milch holen wollte. Und ich will nicht l\u00fcgen, es war f\u00fcr mich als kleiner Junge auch wie ein Abenteuer da im Schneegest\u00f6ber rauszugehen. Und ein bisschen Angst hatte ich auch. Als ich die gefunden hatte, war ich sehr w\u00fctend \u2013 einfach nur w\u00fctend. Aber dann habe ich verstanden, dass sie einfach in einer andere Art Zeitzone war manchmal. Sie sprach von ganz anderen Dingen.\n\nSehr konkret hing das Alzheimer mit dem Tod meines Gro\u00dfvaters zusammen. Fr\u00fcher gab es sehr strikte Rollenverteilungen. Als mein Gro\u00dfvater verstarb ist ihre elementare St\u00fctze weggebrochen. Und sie konnte es nicht mehr verarbeiten. Sie hatte auch eine Art Schlaganfall, bei dem sie auch \u00f6fter meinen Namen gerufen hat. Sie war da auch l\u00e4nger im Krankenhaus. Danach hat sie immer mehr abgebaut.\n\nDie ganze Zeit \u00fcber drei Jahre hatte lustige Situationen, sch\u00f6ne Situationen aber auch ganz klar traurige Situationen. Lustig war bspw., dass Haushaltsgegenst\u00e4nde versteckt wurden und dann an Orten aufgetaucht sind an denen man es nicht erwartet h\u00e4tte. Meine Mutter besa\u00df Kaschmirpullower, die meine Oma in die Kochw\u00e4sche geschmissen hatte. Meine Mutter war sehr ruhig in solchen Situationen\n\nB\u00fcgeleisen angelassen, Kabel verschmolzen. Da muss man eben schnell reagieren. Und auch Verwechslungen, bei denen meine Oma Menschen verwechselt hat.\n\nMeine Mutter ist Grundschullehrerin. Sie hat versucht mich relativ aus diesen Umsorgungen herauszulassen. Aber wenn sie auf Elternabenden war, musste ich mich bspw. um Oma k\u00fcmmern. Im fr\u00fchen Stadium konnte man noch Brettspiele mit ihr spielen. Sowohl die Pflegering als auch der jetztige Mann (damals Freund) meiner Mutter haben sich sehr aufopfernd mitgek\u00fcmmert.\n\nWenn wir uns der Aufgabe nicht angenommen h\u00e4tten, dann w\u00e4re es f\u00fcr meine Mutter eine schlimme Last gewesen, dass sie es nicht gewollt oder gekonnt h\u00e4tte. Meine Oma im Altersheim zu lassen w\u00e4re sehr schwierig gewesen f\u00fcr meine Mutter \u2013 mit der Gewissheit zu leben, dass sie nicht da war.\n\nF\u00fcr meine Mutter war die Situation nat\u00fcrlich schwierig. Es gab gro\u00dfe Einschr\u00e4nkungen im Alltagsleben.\n\n\n## Honey befragt Leoni\n\n**Wie glaubst du k\u00f6nnte man Pflege in unserer Heutigen Welt angehen?**\n\n**In der n\u00e4heren Umgebung?**\n\nIch muss niemanden pflegen.\n\nEs ist pflege sich mit Freundin zu unterhalten.\n\n**Bei dir selbst?**\n\nSich bewegen, den K\u00f6rper Pflegen. Die Psyche Pflegen.\n\n**Warum musst du dich pflegen?**\n\nDamit ich gesund bleibe.\n\n**Ist es ein Problem das Menschen dieses Bed\u00fcrfnis nicht haben?**\n\nUnterschiedlich. Solange du keine Probleme hast musst du dich nicht darum k\u00fcmmern.\n\nEs kann passieren, dass du MS hast.\n\nIch wie? nicht ob eine Leib, Seele Trennung Sinn macht. Man kann im Gehirn zeigen, das psychische Probleme sich K\u00f6rperlich H\u00e4usern. Wir haben sie nur noch nicht verstanden. Man kann K\u00f6rper und Geist nicht trennen.\n\n**K\u00f6rperkult?**\n\nSport und Bewegung ist Pflege, aber man muss unterscheiden. Dreimal die Woche rennen gehen kann nicht gesund sein. F\u00fcr manche Menschen eventuell schon. Es geht um die reine Bewegung F\u00fcr die Durchblutung, den Sauerstoffgehalt, die Haut, die Sonne bekommt. F\u00fcr den ganzen K\u00f6rper.\n\n**Bewegungsunf\u00e4higkeit.**\n\nIch hatte eine Bekannte die im Rollstuhl sa\u00df. Sie musste alle zwei Stunden nach Hause an eine Ladestation. Eigentlich k\u00f6nnte sie Laufen, doch sie hat Spastiken und traut sich nicht ohne den Rollstuhl zu laufen. Sehr motivierend finde ich die L\u00e4ufer der Paralympics.\n\n**Stellst du deine Pflege vor die Pflege anderer?**\n\nDas steht in einem Jing-Jang Verh\u00e4ltnis. Wenn im Flugzeug der Druck f\u00e4llt, wird dir auch gesagt, dass du zuerst selbst die Maske anziehen sollt und dann anderen.\n\nNur in wenigen Situationen wiederspricht mein Pflegebed\u00fcrfnis dem der anderen. Das Problem ist wenn Leute nicht genug bekommen.\n\n**Wir helfen der Menschheit damit?**\n\nNein, das Mittlere Management, macht nichts anderes als andere Leute zu beobachten. Ich denke die Meisten Menschen wollen etwas Sinnvolle tun.\n\n**Wie ver\u00e4ndert das das Verh\u00e4ltnis zu anderen, Familie.**\n\nEs ist ein Wechselspiel. In einer Gro\u00dffamilie ist es egal ob zu einem Pflegebed\u00fcrftigen Kind noch ein alter daf\u00fcr kommt. Menschen sind eher daf\u00fcr gemacht in Rudeln zu leben. Es muss ja nicht Zwangsl\u00e4ufig die Familie sein sondern eine Gruppe Menschen, der man sich anschlie\u00dft.\n\nPflege ist ein Verh\u00e4ltnis. Menschen machen nichts, was sie unertr\u00e4glich finden. Auch bei kleinen Kindern. Wenn du dir das Objektive Betrachtest ist es sehr hart. Rund um die Uhr Betreuung, Nachts Ausstehen. Pflege ist nie Einseitig.\n\n\n## Philipp befragt Honey\n\nHabe noch nie mitbekommen dass es transdisziplin\u00e4re Zusammenarbeit gibt\n\nThema war sekund\u00e4r\n\nJede Interaktion mit der Umwelt ist Pflege\n\nPflege beruht auf Erfahrung und die haben wir in uns, man kann den Umgang mit der Umwelt antrainieren, wenn ich mit der Weise wie ich mit der Welt umgehe zufrieden bin, dann ist es auch wie eine Pflege f\u00fcr mich selbst\n\nInsgesamt ist das kapitalistische System in uns ein Chaos ausgel\u00f6st\n\nWir stehen als Generation st\u00e4ndig im Mittelpunkt\n\nGesellschaft wertet st\u00e4ndig und Geld bewertet Dinge\n\nMan kann keine Verantwortung f\u00fcr 300 Leute \u00fcbernehmen und man sucht sich schon genau aus zu wem man seine Verbindung aufbaut\n\nIch rede mit mir selbst \u00fcber Zeitmanagement obwohl das eigentlich nat\u00fcrlich sein sollte\n\nDie Intuition wird immer schw\u00e4cher, man muss immer eine Grundlage von Pro und Contra f\u00fcr alle seine Entscheidungen haben\n\nWirtschaft beeinflusst die Politik sodass die die Leute beeinflussen schneller in den Hamsterk\u00e4fig zu gelangen.

Before the Earthquake, I was working on a research on truth-seeking process in Nepal about the 10 years long conflict period. After the Earthquake, I have been running around in a frenzy. The first few days, we spent managing the community I lived in (read: preparing food for them, assuring them at a 10 Richter's scale earthquake will not happen, and looking at one new born baby). Relief and rescue missions started, help pledges started to pour in, Facebook somehow managed to not crash with all that feed, but it has soon become clear to all that there are loopholes to this process. The lack of coordination between the larger agencies, and individual and local initiatives has led to many a problems and will only continue to do so.\n\nWhile immediate relief is the focus (for obvious reasons) right now in Nepal, there is a greater need felt to coordinate these efforts. I am hoping that this particular project, at its heart, is trying to address this situation.\n\nI have started to blog at keepvigilnepal.wordpress.com as my own tiny attempt at getting a grasp in this vortex.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-06 05:35:39", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:56.696352", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 215, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 10.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3666, "user_id": 1687, "topic_id": 3633, "post_number": 1, "raw": "(jotted down from memory afterwards, please edit)\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>present: @Dorotea, @Noemi, @Natalia , @Bembo, @NicoBis, @Matthias, @Pacheca, @katalin</span></span>\n\n<span>How is everyone? </span>\n\n<span><span>Noemi:</span></span>\n\n<span><span>Need to talk about how to work together better, so it is not such a burn-out inducing process.</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>Katalin:</span></span>\n\n<span><span>Run a session on training people to help?</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>Noemi:</span></span>\n\n<span><span>Yes!

Are we sure that going there is not superimposing on the local community which might be tired to hear about unMonastery? Both of them remain solidary with the community there, to the point that they are doing work on the book of Mistakes and think hard about continuity of the unMon rather than following closely fellow Edgeryders (our freakish processes :)) and other spaces Lote might be heading towards..\n\nTo this end, they stand ready to support @Ben more and help with curating the agenda, making sure unMon has a solid space for discussion in it. An actionable is to upload parts of their work into the conference program.\n\nAn actionable for us all:\n\nDo you know or have heard a great talk or project presentation in a conference where you've been? Do you think someone is doing stewardship work and should know about Lote but hasn't had the chance yet?

Azerbaijan's economy is in terrible shape right now. Their currency dropped 40% in value against the dollar in January. Their entire economy is almost completely tied to oil and oil prices are at the lowest point in a decade. Mass protests against corruption and a depressed economy in Azerbaijan have increased in recent months. Invading Nagorno-Karabagh is an attempt to boost nationalism and act as a distraction from real problems at home. All that plus Russia's deteriorating relationship with Turkey, a strong political ally of Azerbaijan, creates a terrible condition for Azerbajian to act aggressively against Nagorno-Karabakh.\" \u00a0<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/yesayan/posts/10103985715331355?fref=nf\">Erik Yesayan</a>\n\n\"Armed with the knowledge of <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Terra-Incognita-History-and-tragedy-Caucasus-war-clouds-450131\">the history of this conflict</a>, it is easy to discern that it is not in Artsakh\u2019s interests to break the peace and renew hostilities.

In fact, the development of the attention to the detail of what is being offered in the menus changed definitely the way we eat out of home. Nowadays, eating in a restaurant is seen and lived not only as a way to satisfy biological needs and to spend own leisure time or to break from work at lunchtime, but as a \u201ctrendy\u201d form of experience and entertainment.\n\nThe space-time we spend in restaurants can be understood as a network of symbols, matter (edible or not) and relationships. All this appears as a system that works well, satisfies us, but that to tell the truth we are actually satisfying. \n\nIf the quantity of products in the portions has considerably reduced, it is often the form or combination of extreme attention to quality and taste that rules. That is, we are often in the presence of a inconsistent innovation in forms and colors, in the ways of presenting food, at the expense of a needed revolution that should have included attention to the specific needs of the pluralism of the customers. \n\nA revolution in care of the customers as eaters. \n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/4/49e368847b5bfbddf1d9cbd5aa90b3bde8491eef.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"387\">\n\nRestaurants should inter operate today with cultures, beliefs, personal needs. Unfortunately, all these elements are excluded _a priori_ in the construction of the professional identity of chefs and in the management of the cuisine experience we live any time we enter in one of such wonderful temples of taste.\n\nThis is the scenario from which the Maker in residence activity of [Monica](https://issuu.com/monica) and [Nicoletta](https://www.behance.net/nicolettafaltracco), two designers of Vicenza, started their interesting and useful project named Allergo K\u00ec.\n\nPlease, read more about the project [Allergo K\u00ec](https://edgeryders.eu/t/allergo-ki-user-journey-experience-interviews-and-prototyping/6603)\n\nThe first peculiar aspect of the Allergo K\u00ec project is to present the theme of allergies in the context of the restaurants not as a problem, but as a solution. Daily troubles experienced by eaters with allergies is still lived by restaurants as a temporary incident that should not happen and that is an exceptional need.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a0cfa1c1ae20489371a7e9d4656ef9aa52aadefe.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"516\">\n\nAllergo K\u00ec makes a philosophy centered on the inclusion of customers with allergies. The experience for those who are sensitive to certain foods should be designed and included in the catering facilities also to promote and facilitate the social life of citizens with allergies. At play there is a power dynamic based on inclusion/exclusion, transforming the theme of allergies into a problem of food rights. Another fundamental theme is the one of identity, since having allergies can not be considered something that is not inherent in daily, relational, personal life. \n\nThe solution offered by Allergo K\u00ec is deployed in the materiality of the physical details of a device (round place card) and symbolism for a guided experience for both the customer and the operator, waiter, chef, etc. This leads to rethink the experience by overcoming the lack of information and knowledge by integrating it with the round place card that has the most comprehensive and complex representation in the classification and _ad hoc_ symbols of allergies.", "created_at": "2017-07-31 10:57:30.792005", "updated_at": "2017-10-05 17:40:23.472229", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 585, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 451.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3597, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32253, "user_id": 3025, "topic_id": 5121, "post_number": 21, "raw": "<b>a couple of guesses ...</b>\n\njust a couple of guesses ... why they react that way:\n\n- worry about you ending up bancrupt and homeless (alternatively as a dead crackwhore in a trunk) if you don't grab every opportunity to make money.\n\n- following up on your guess of you critizising their life: I guess it can be an inner reaction towards the integrity that shines through when you chose yourself over the money, because they themselves are not doing what they would like to do the most.

But to make a long story short, I'm a medical doctor by education and I've practiced at the University hospital in Bologna before. I'm also a researcher interested in formal fundamental questions. So, you could say I would be classified as \"interdisciplinary\" by some. I've been working a lot on mathematics and Information Systems studies, mostly in the context of medical ecosystems.\n\nI started at the University of Bologna, I moved very shortly to Portugal and the UK where I had the chance of spending time with wonderful mentors with whom I am still in touch today, and I was a researcher at the University of Maastricht for several years, helping to set up the computational biology research line of the experimental pathology group, among other things. After that I got summoned to CERN in Geneva, to serve as a senior fellow of the Director General for medical applications. In between, I founded the [SCimPulse Foundation](http://www.scimpulse.org/about-us/), which I still direct. I am also part of several scientific organisations and commissions, including (maybe the most relevant about our conversation to come) the working group of NATO for human control over autonomous systems.\n\nI was connected to the military in the past from the medical side, because of chance encounters, and in reason of the facts the military are extremely active in healthcare and public health. It so happened that Italy was not represented in the mentioned NATO working group, and someone recommended me. W are tasked with reviewing literature, and technology accidents, in order to identify pitfalls and recommend best practices. We discuss the weaknesses of current approaches to regulations, and design recommendations on engineering autonomous systems. It's mostly theoretical. We don't have a lab where we can grow our own evil puppets (LOL), and see whether we can train them out of evilness.\n\nDespite the group having access to classified material in principle, most of the autonomous systems related accidents really happen in the public domain, outside of military context, there where any European citizen could be aware of: reports on events in which artificial intelligence systems \u2014 which may have been involved in decisions \u2014 did not have the expected outcome are published very often and can involve anything from assisted driving systems all the way to decision support systems in healthcare. Civil society on the other side of the Pond has been extremely prolific lately, producing examples of bias in classification of suspects in police investigations, or involving the exclusion of entire population groups from proper follow-up care, or from access to credit.\n\n## Asking the right questions\n\nWhen you train any machine learning system on a data set, you normally think that you are assigning a task to the machine. In truth this is always slightly different in the sense that the task is encoded in such a way that you award the machine \"gains\" for solving the puzzle through the data that you're giving it. And the machine is actually only trying to get those gains, it is not making any sense of the task. This means that any loopholes in your design will be exploited very efficiently by the machine! When this happens in a gaming context, the researchers react enthusiastically by claiming the machine \"thought outside of the box\", or \"learnt to cheat\"... but imagine black people receiving worse follow-up care, because their social context is associated with lower rates of follow-up. Would you be satisfied with a recommender \"guessing\" that being black, or coming from that social context is by itself a predictor of low effectiveness in care practice, thus recommending not to follow-up with your patient?\n\nThe data is biased because the system is, the AI simply learnt to give you the most rewarding reply, without care for the amplification of bias (because that was never part of the game for it). \nAnd what do we, humans, learn from biased data? That it should not be used for classification, that we should use it to focus on pitfalls we want to challenge. \nSo the issue boils down to the following: should we ask ML/AI to guess from the data under which category does a fellow human fall, in striving for efficiency, as to exclude her/him from a certain benefit? Or should we rather try to force the machine to assist us in finding effective (not efficient) ways to include them?\n\nAdopting ML/AI today is a bit like a magic trick... but in the show-biz sense, not in the silver-bullet sense. When you go to a magician' show (say David Copperfield's, I like his art quite a lot), he will distract you. And then something else appears in the middle of your supposed attention field that you were not really focusing on. Simply, because you were not paying attention. Similarly, most of the autonomous systems applications attract a lot of hype, under the pretence of making something very fast and efficient, and this distract us but what they won't do, and won't let happen.\n\nThe problem is not whether you could use the data set. Could you curate the data set to make it unbiased? At face value, you could obfuscate the sensitive variables, and claim the dataset has not bias. But virtual variables can be inferred, even if they are not in a database, just like an exercise of missing values imputation. The big F is known to be able to infer data by crossing information between an external ID and the data of her/his contact on the platform...\nThus, not... the problem does not lie within the data exclusively, it lies with our intended purpose for them and ML/AI: we're just asking questions that we take at face value as if we were proposing them to a sentient entity that would of course interpret them contextually, and we are forgetting that instead when talking to a machine we should questioning the questions we ask, ourselves, for it. The true bias is that we are using extremely effective cheating systems to multiply what we&rsquo;re already doing. Instead of asking ourselves how we&rsquo;re able to improve certain situations. That's the direction where we really want to go, I believe.\n\nFor example, I find someone burgling in an apartment, and I have to judge \u2014 let's imagine I'm a judge \u2014 whether this person will re-offend. To me this becomes a very clear problem. Let's imagine a scenario where we all tend to feel strongly there is a need for intervention: a man who is stalking his ex-wife. Of course, we want to prevent him from reoffending. Right? That's without a doubt. \nNow, as a human, I ask myself: &ldquo;is he likely to reoffend. How can I prevent it?&rdquo; ...there might be ideas about temporary restrictions, coupled with therapy and education, and establishing a redline for a certain time window when re-offense might be most likely...\nBut when I ask the same question to a machine, this could be shortcut to simply meaning \"how often does re-offense by this category of person get pursuit?\" and recommend me not the best strategy to prevent re-offense and support all the parties move over, it will simply remind me we have to be harder with marginalised individuals with complicated mental-health conditions, and we can be lenient with those individuals who are well off enough to obtain a good legal assistance...\n\nThis is not necessarily a tech-only related question, but about the working of the justice system \u2014 since this is what we're talking about \u2014 the question could be whether are we using the right tools to ensure that people do not re-offend?\n\nThe crucial point when ML/AI gets in the picture is the scale. If I am the only judge and I'm working on my own locally, the tools I have to judge are limited, and bias creeps in my practice as I attempt to exploit heuristics to deal with the burden of my task. Luckily, the bias in my heuristic is local, can be made sense of and appear in audits, ...I can ultimately be trained off of some (and maybe into others... nobody is perfect).\nBut, if I'm deploying the largest system, extremely fast and effective in browsing data, historical information, logistic information, and more: why am I still asking questions as if I were a single person with limited access to information, imagining the system will magically produce the best reply in a context in which I am even avoiding the challenge of aligning my goals with those announced in our Constitutions?\n\nI guess what I am pointing to is that we should work out what questions does AI enable us to ask that we could not ask before? What constructive questions? And what questions need to be avoided or to be reformulated? \nRather than just answering questions we already have, faster and dumber.\n\nRight now, we are not trying this out for real. The AI revolution at the moment is justified by the idea that we are having machines, doing tasks with less effort, at scale... but we are still in a phase in which we \"humanise\" them, and don't really work well with them.\n\nThis is not going to be easy. We don't fully understand human reasoning either. If you look at economics, for instance, the work of Professor Ole Peters, who has identified a formal mistake at the roots of the most common formulation of expected utility theory. Most of the research in this field, if I may, say, is low quality because it tried fitting human thought process to a shakily grounded model of wealth dynamics... thus claiming human irrationality in the most stressful context (a bias, I may say?). Now, when he worked out the theory from the corrected formalism, he figured out that what was considered as irrational decision making actually makes sense, formally. If something as simple as deciding on a bet, between two different types of return dynamics (additive vs multiplicative) has seemed so dramatically complicated to academics for centuries, I might be allowed to state that our assumptions about how we decide in more complicated situations, are wrong. We are often asking ourselves different questions from those we think we are formulating. But once we translate these into machine language, the machine is extremely proficient in engineering precisely the question we're formulating. And this is a short coming on our side, the onus is ours to begin with.\n\nThere is research into rethinking the question we ask... more importantly there is research into making explicit how we formulate the question to ask. But you understand that in a moment of hype about ML/AI, this is not a sexy topic, despite being an extremely important piece of work within machine learning and artificial intelligence. And so, most of the discourse around human control over artificial intelligence is focused today on explainability, or reproducibility of the decisions (a historical inheritance of the old days claim that artificial neural networks were too much of a black box). One of the requirements for a new decision to be accepted among us humans is that it has to be convincing in the arguments and assumptions. So, if you have something which predicts the next value of your dice every time you throw it, but you cannot explain how it works, you think it's a trick, right? Exactly like with David Copperfield. You want to understand where information is leaked for the prediction to be faked, if the prediction itself cannot be explained. This is to say explainability is extremely important - some co-workers and I work on the problem of the explainability and interpretability of autonomous systems decisions, as well... but it's not enough, it's just half (or maybe I am too optimistic, and it is less) of the work we need... rethinking how we question the world with this new tools is as important, at least.\n\n\n## Healthcare and AI\n\nHere&rsquo;s an example from the medical field: predictive medicine. Around the 1970s, a number of tools were introduced in the medical field, relatively simple tools that were meant to assist doctors in predicting the likelihood of disease... scoring systems which would assign the person in front of you to a class which shared a certain risk of experiencing some clinically relevant event in the coming 5-10 years.\n\nWith progresses in data crunching, the medical community has been expecting these classification systems to become more refined: they can digest more data, they can be more precise in the finesse the classes. That's the expectation of precision medicine: not just knowing that a person has more than 20% likelihood in 10 years of having an event, but distinguishing among those who might have likelihoods of 19%, or 30%, or maybe even 50% . But this hasn&rsquo;t really happened.\n\nThis relates a bit to the work of Ole Peters in economics. In the 1970s, with no other tools available, the ingenuity of the doctors that have been tackling the problem of production has been to use methods that were used, also in other industries. You were guessing that if two patients had a certain relevant trait/profile, they would share the same risk. And because they could only handle a few variables at once \u2014 such as for example cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, etc. these profiles where relative simple and \"inclusive\".\nWhen researchers try to enrich these profiles, what's happening is that you meet a new barrier: you are confusing the question concerning the destiny of the person in front of you right now, with the question of the destiny of every similar person. The more precise you get, the more you diverge. \nImagine you are entering a lottery, and you know that at the end of the day, the lottery pays off (overall distribution of prizes per chance classes vs costs of the entry ticket). So, it's a fair game. But, you may try to play the lottery your whole life without winning any single time. And if you go bankrupt, before winning, then there's no point in knowing it was fair... This happens because it is fair to a set of infinite players, but one player in realistic conditions will never be able to play infinite times...\n\n\nTo continue...\n\nIn ecology and evolutionary biology, they have been working on formalizing fitness landscapes, where you interpret the meaning of certain conditions, complex, formal environments. And you can understand how easy or difficult it is to move from one position to another. In economy, there are methods to infer what your likely number of steps are before bankruptcy, starting from a certain point, knowing that the likely the likelihood of gaining or losing at each step is a certain amount. Now, if you could unite this, you could have a very different beast in predictive medicine, instead of trying to collect all the data of everyone and behave in medicine like you do in marketing: if you purchase beer, you are very likely to purchase chips. But there are many more data points in medicine, it&rsquo;s not the same as buying a beer and being likely to buy chips.\n\nAnd it's not only that there are more data points, it's that it's a really different question. If you look into the general population: people who smoke, in general, have more probability to have lung cancer. This is like marketing. People who purchase a beer are likely to purchase chips. But if you are asking: is Merkel going to have cancer? Now, that's NOT a marketing question. Because in marketing you care about the mass, you want to sell more chips, and even if somebody doesn't buy them, okay, it happens. But with medicine, it makes a huge difference.\n\nIf, on average, these markers are more likely to have a disease, do these patients have more risk in the next two years, one year, three years? And being a different question, you will have to work with completely different mathematics. If you&rsquo;d invest in this kind of research in the next 10 years, with these kind of resources, maybe you will be closer to a much more interesting product. But if everything we do with AI looks just like speeding up what we were doing 20 years ago, we will never get to a point of real improvement.\n\nEven if we make these tools auditable, we would be able to learn that the mistake was done in good faith. But is it making it any better for the people?\n\nIf you look at ethics in a pragmatic way, you are not really answering the needs.\n\n## Justifying Machine Learning\n\nWe may be pushing AI onto the markets, because we are in a rush for &ldquo;supremacy&rdquo; on the market. We did it before. For example, after the diffusion of web marketing systems, medicine, received a lot of investments to dematerialize medical data and make them available on the web. The idea was that this would improve metrics of success, whether this was patients involvement in care, or smoothing out pathways across different services. It was done with precisely the same approach that we are seeing today in machine learning: because it was a success for marketing, it would be a success in medicine: the electronic health records that were mostly designed under the current practice of data collection, that was justified by billing.\n\nBut 20 to 30 years after, the impact of electronic health records on medical practice isn&rsquo;t that great: it takes a lot of time out of care. Humans have to put a lot of work to digest the data in a way that the system can deal with them. And this data is taken out of relationships. And if the system is just speeding up the wrong process, the outcome won't be magical.\n\nWhat is happening right now is that the AI technology in Europe is being accelerated to be used. But were massively risking getting the wrong results, because we're not asking the right questions.\n\nMedicine is one of the fields where there's not really a huge gain by using AI. But a lot of money is being spent both on the development and marketing of it. And this money absorbs other investments. Investing a lot of money trying to train an AI \u2014 that money isn&rsquo;t going into training clinicians, not into getting better tools, not invested in your patients, not even in redesigning hospital spaces.\n\nMy argument isn&rsquo;t that we shouldn&rsquo;t look into AI, but the true question should be how do we go there? We have never questioned, what's the moment, and what should be the mechanism, the funnel for AI to enter medicine. At the moment, it&rsquo;s a vastly unregulated system. As long as a company claims that they have a product, they can start investing and working on it, absorbing public resources.\n\nWell-established practices should be studied. Questions figuring out how much of a certain practice or investigation is informed by current limitations of the system, and if they are informed by the declared agreed upon goal of the system. These are slightly different problems. We should also look at the states or the communities where they have power: they should try to enforce systems of control, or the introductions of these tools, not systems that are extremely punitive. Our goal is not to make it impossible for innovation to enter, but not to make it too easy.\n\nA good example of this, is what's happening with FDA and the accelerated acceptance of drugs. A recently published review on the drugs that have enjoyed the accelerated acceptance by FDA in the last two decades, uncovered that none of them had any survival gains. So, we created a mechanism where innovative products saving lives enter the market quicker, but in reality, none of them actually did what they were supposed to do.\n\n## Stifling innovation?\n\nWe&rsquo;re creating a lot of regulation that contains redundant regulation. It is well intentioned at the European level, but it's countered by national governments. At the same time, a lot of the conversations and negotions don&rsquo;t happen at the policy level, but in discussions about standards.\n\nThese are all tricks. Both standards, and most of the policies are tricks. For example the GDPR. A few years ago before it actually entered into force, I knew it would most likely be more challenging to be GDPR compliant for small organization than for the large ones. So, despite the declared goal being &ldquo;we are going to rule how Google and Facebook access your data,&rdquo; we already knew this was going to hinder small organization&rsquo;s activities, and actually a treasure trove for the big ones. And what happened if we look at the reviews, two years later, three years later, that's exactly what happened.\n\nMost of the policy created isn&rsquo;t really to regulate. And it becomes a hinder, because it was the goal from the beginning.\n\nAnother problem is lobbying: we don&rsquo;t have a lobbying registry. So, we don't know how much time and gifts our politicians received from lobbying groups.\n\nThere is a lot that could be improved about how Europe works. And this is not the nature of policymaking, this is how policymaking is implemented in Europe. That's a problem. It's a systematic problem, but not a principal problem. It's really systematic of the system. The problem lies not in the idea that we want to have policies to regulate issues, the problem is how we do them. And the same happens for standards. Most of the standards are imposed after de facto companies who ruled the market have agreed about it on the phone. I've hardly ever seen any standard being imposed before the large companies were already ready for them.\n\nWe are allowing it.\n\nAI could definitely be regulated, and I think it should be regulated. But, there is a misconception of the public about the advantages of research. You will need to consider that you cannot scale up at will, without any consideration for the damage that you can cause. You need to be informed about the risks, you need to have a plan B for the risk. And these doesn't hinder progress. There is no advantage in having research that can scale up, without any consideration for the damage it could cause.\n\nWhen it comes to biometrics, for example, that we are at a point that we should&rsquo;ve asked questions before, because maybe it's too late now. When authorizing the first research on these at scale, we should have asked &ldquo;what are the implications of generating tools that unify your physical body with your identity.&rdquo; Because in all our societies, your identities are demonstrated by documents you bring, or by relationships you have. They have to be demanded with data to be verified. And your body is not automatically your identification. At the moment you introduce\n\nbiometric tools, whether they are effective or not, you are claiming a unification of the soul. This is the first time it is happening in human societies. We never had companies, humans, or states that were able to impose an identity on a body. And we never reflected on what changes these imply for the social contract of our life to live life together. And this is extremely radical. The point is not whether we want to be faster in telling whether you are yourself when you are entering the train. The point is, what are the implications when these permeates all fields of our life? And maybe now it's a bit too late to ask because it's out there.\n\nI mean, there are other ways to try to skew how things are adopted and used. Even China, even while it&rsquo;s currently extremely powerful, it isn&rsquo;t alone on this planet as a result of the market and diplomatic relationships\n\n## The Future of AI\n\nWe have to accept that a number of things that were tolerated before \u2014 because they were convenient for everyone, the industry, corrupted officers, and whoever \u2014 should now be regulated in a slightly different way. We cannot go through a phenomenon \u2014 ignoring it scale, wanting this ruling, access to account 413000 tourists for example \u2014 and then trying to have similar rules when a country next door is crumbling.\n\nWhen you try to regulate taxes, as if we were regulating Western immigration for professionals \u2014 all the wrong and strange narratives about migrations and sustainability start to emerge. When honestly, it's your mistake for trying to regulate one phenomenon with the rules of something completely different. And the same applies to a single person \u2014 whatever his role, whether it's a doctor, or it's a judge, a policeman. We love to have a system where applications scale up extremely fast, basically, on any device around you tomorrow. Even if I as a doctor,wouldn&rsquo;t use it, maybe the hospital is using it, maybe the medical registry are using it.\n\nI don't think there is a short cut. Unfortunately, we have some major powers in this field, but we could frame it. Our best shot, however, is trying to coordinate a movement independently of the singular individual activity of producing the reflections and conversation around the topic. There is nothing bad in trying to have a bit of activism about things that are fundamentally screwing the way your life and your society work.\n\nAnd AI, like climate change, may call for something of this scale. Because, it's being treated as &ldquo;just the next technology,&rdquo; but it's completely different from a smartphone. And the smartphone already had a massive impact on society. It's a Trojan horse, under the disguise of making it easier. And it's a terrific tool for speeding up everything we don't like about our society.\n\nIt's frustrating. And it&rsquo;s similar to my participation in the working group: we have no guarantee NATO will pick up our recommendations. We express critical opinions suggesting to reflect, and to invest in human resources. Okay, we analyze accidents of the past, for example the famous incident where a ship got lost because the GPS was signaling it was in a different location. This is something that would have never happened to the Vikings, they were reading the stars. Until the 19th century, every sailor needed to be able to read with a compass the stars. Now, they were navigating on GPS, everything is fine, nobody even checked.\n\nAnd the same can happen with the automatic systems. Invest in people to train their skills, that's the only resource you should really aim at.\n\nAt the end of the day, countries can still decide to have a drone with the decision to kill enabled, that works on some biometrics system from China, that will kill the person next door mistakenly during a wedding. As individuals, our power is very limited. But independently of all that, as individuals we are trying to raise is a very neoliberal idea that an individual can change the society.\n\nWe should be trained in the mere basics and the foundations, and not use AI as our leader dictating us what to do, but as a nifty tool that could maybe help us.", "created_at": "2019-10-09 15:04:15.589988", "updated_at": "2020-12-10 13:11:53.759281", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4668, "wiki": true, "reads": 16, "score": 318.2, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4934, 8, 2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 36903, "user_id": 3745, "topic_id": 6683, "post_number": 34, "raw": "Hi, I am also looking for accommodation - any and all suggestions welcome.

One 1 hr video call for **Project Contributors:** People who have stepped up in the call for participation in the community covid response efforts, as well as others we will reach out to via an open call. In this call we will identify what elements need to be in the program (esp mini hackathons) in order for them to be meaningful, fun and respectful of your time/effort/constraints/interests etc. Here @trythis and @jasen_lakic @msanti  immediately come to mind.\n\n3. One 1hr video call for **Problem Owners:** We want to dedicate a call to people who are currently navigating complex issues that need support in surfacing and aligning many different people, activities, projects, processes to address them. One example of such a problem owner is introduced by @alberto  here: https://edgeryders.eu/t/epistemic-resilience-of-the-medical-community-a-proposal-that-just-came-through/13013/7 Others would be people working in contexts where the whole space /business models etc are affected by the current crisis and what will come after e.g people running physcial space reliant activitives e.g co-working spaces like @ichraf and @hugi or people working in the performance arts/culture e.g @kajafarszky @matteo_uguzzoni\n\n **What do you think , are you up for coming to one call which feels most relevant to you?

Erin Westover is the European market lead at proptech company Upflex, which has seen an uptick in inquiries since Covid-19 hit as organisations have decided to make a move toward distributed work.\n\nUpflex works with established companies that have staff working remotely and allows employees to see which co-working spaces near their homes are free. Westover said before the crisis she needed to explain the technology and its importance to clients but now people are aware of its merits and asking questions.\n\nThe fact that the company\u2019s technology allows its users to enter and exit co-working space using their phone as a key, is really relevant at a time when public health is a priority and contact free ways of doing things are encouraged\n\nSimilarly, Jonny Cosgrove, the founder of [meetingRoom.io](http://meetingroom.io/), which provides virtual reality meeting room software that focuses on collaboration for smaller groups of three to 20 people, has seen an increased number of sign-ups during the crisis and a lot of interest from coworking spaces who are sensing the change.\n\nAs many workers have become \u2018Zoomed-out\u2019 in recent months, Cosgrove offers a solution that seems more human and focuses less on oral communication and encompasses gestures and space.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be an Edgeryders\u2019 summit wthour plenty of questions - we will be exploring further how we can retain the connectedness we have built during Covid -19 going forward.\n\nGary O\u2019Meara who is the chairman of the National Association of Community Enterprise Centres, co-working spaces in Ireland, and one of our speakers at the event has made the point that Covid has helped us become more connected: \u201cHow can we build on that?\u201d\n\nMaybe the answe lies inFaye Alund\u2019s thoughts that the power of community to \u201cactivate initiatives and make them more successful\u201d should be utilised in coworking spaces.\n\nFaye is the president of Coworking Indonesia, a community-focused coworking space of entrepreneurs and social activists, and will be one of our speakers at the event.\n\nMayur Sontakke is an owner of a coworking space in Goa, India. Like Faye, he is of the opinion that co-working spaces need to focus on community to prosper. Within his space, he focuses on community, customer services and building relationships.\n\nAnother coworking owner will also be speaking at the event - Nacho Rodriquez, based in the Canary Islands, Spain. For him coworking spaces can do more than just bring a community together, they can also bring affluence to certain areas that may not have attracted industry. With his long term plan is to extend his offerings to more rural locations.\n\nJoin our summit on July 21, by signing up [here](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/how-to-support-the-recovery-of-the-coworking-sector-a-virtual-summit-tickets-111403930154).\n\nFor more information on our speakers read [this](https://edgeryders.eu/t/how-to-support-recovery-of-the-coworking-sector-an-online-summit-bringing-together-key-industry-figures-and-wider-sector-participants/13987) thread.", "created_at": "2020-07-02 16:56:19.087392", "updated_at": "2020-07-19 11:21:41.183483", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 629, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 188.6, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3310, 4096, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 49600, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 7122, "post_number": 32, "raw": "They should not be clumped together because the two conveyors and funnels in [the current machine design](/t/id/8086) will place the beans into a single line, with enough distance between them so that each can be removed individually.\n\nThrowing out the whole group of beans together would also be an option, though. Commercial optical sorters do it similarly: they create \"first rejects\" in a first pass, which includes some good beans. The first rejects are then fed to the machine again.

Time for an update to get everyone on the same page. \n\n## Funding and architecture\n\nWe just received news that EIT Climate-KIC is willing to fund the Lab's core activities for 2020, subject to certain conditions. This means that there are now two sources of funding for the Lab:\n\n* The *core* activities consist of producing out-of-the-box economic knowledge, and seeking impact by trying to influence policy. This might include stuff like producing papers, webinars, events, publications etc. These are funded by the new project, about 130K EUR, of which Edgeryders is going to cover 30%.\n* The *community* activities consist of reaching out to people on the ground implementing non-standard economic models (eco-villages, neo-cooperatives, local currencies etc.), learning from them and pushing these learnings into a broader intellectual circuit. These are funded by EIT Climate-KIC's Deep Demonstration on Long-Termism programme, about 90K EUR of which Edgeryders is going to cover 20%. \n\n## Impact and revenue pathways\n\nThe Lab's mission is to produce and amplify out-of-the-box economic thinking. \nThe main way that the Lab can make an impact is by incorporating such thinking into policy. We therefore intend to frame the Lab as a think tank that offers \"edge consulting\". \n\nIn practice, this means baking long-term, out-of-the-box economic thinking into services and other activities that, unlike the thinking itself, have a market. We intend for them to be \u201cTrojan horses\u201d for this kind of radical thinking; if we are successful, they will create a market for more ambitious business models, investment strategies, policies. In turn, this market demand will reduce the friction associating to transitioning to a low carbon economy. At the same time, this move will create a revenue stream to fund the Lab's knowledge-creating (marketless) activities.\n\nOther possible revenue streams are donations and participation to paid events.\n\n## Partnerships and outreach\n\nIn practice, we need to spend 2020 looking for arenas where the Lab can make a contribution, and pitching for it to become involved. We already have several ideas.\n\n## What happens in April and May? \n\n* *From sensemaking to pitching long-term thinking in economics and finance*. In late March, we attended an online seminar with the whole Long-Termism Deep Demo team. Next step is to prepare a pitch, as a group, for the activities that that Deep Demo deploys in the coming year. \n\n* *Finalize the paperwork of the core project*. We need to go through certain steps to go from conditional acceptance to a signed contract. We are on it. \n\n* *Align the extended team*. @nadia and I are considering organizing a webinar to present the Lab to some handpicked possible champions of the Lab in their respective organizations. Its goal would be to move from the vision to more specific activities and products that we could pitch to policy makers and other possible allies.

It brings together a network of participating centres (nodes) located in the UK, Germany, Italy and Poland and enable experts from across the EU to visit nodes and share their insights. Critically, the network puts in place a rigorous but light-touch mechanism for documenting knowledge exchanges, which will be synthesised into a publication.\n\nEKIP objectives:\n\n<div>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\tExchange knowledge, skills and approaches</li>\n\n<li>\tBuild capabilities in local nodes.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\tIncrease opportunity for exchange of tacit knowledge</li>\n\n<li>\tIntegrate awareness of emerging technologies and practices.</li>\n\n<li>\tBuild transnational network capacity</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<div>\n\nParticipating EKIP initiative have developed grassroots responses to local economic and social challenges, and are building sustainable business models based on their particular insights.

Centres include advanced manufacturing, media production, and information communications technologies, and participating experts have strong engagement with these. It crosses the boundaries of academic disciplines, taking on a practice-based approach.\n\nEKIP engages holistically with local challenges and priorities, and includes centres which address diverse, interconnected agendas around local regeneration, digital inclusion, capacity building, enterprise incubation, education, technology and the arts. Particularly innovative is EKIP's engagement with peer learning methodologies for knowledge transfer, which are manifest throughout the project at individual, organisational, community and network scales.\n\nExamples of innovative practices supported by EKIP nodes include:\n\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\tCultural Commons Collecting Society (C3S) an alternative to Germany's dominant state collecting society (GEMA).</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\tPimoroni, which has used lasercutting and crowdfunding to build a thriving agile manufacturing enterprise in just 16 weeks.</li>\n\n<li>\tOpen Source City Juba, Media &amp; Makers Juba, two major conferences on open data, with South Sudan's new capital Juba as a showcase.</li>\n\n<li>\tFree Culture Incubator, masterclasses and expert meetings resulting in projects and initiatives around free culture business models.</li>\n\n<li>\tGrow Your Own Media Lab \u2013 a publication which seeded Metareciclagem, an influential network of 97 do-it-yourself technology centres across Brazil.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n \n\n<strong>How will your idea have an impact? How will you measure your impact? </strong><b>Please explain how your idea will have an impact on helping target people/groups move towards work or into new types of work.</b>\n\n<div>\n\n<div>\n\nEKIP's initial target group is the communities of practice which make use of each of the four core nodes. These are people situated in local communities in Sheffield, Berlin, Matera and Warsaw. Visiting experts will bring new skills and approaches to those communities, and will learn from local expertise. The project's documentation process will disseminate insights throughout the network.\n\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t12 expert knowledge integration visits in the first phase.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t4 Nodes networked</li>\n\n<li>\t4 knowledge integration visits by node representatives.</li>\n\n<li>\tInvitations issued by host nodes and applications submitted for knowledge integration exchanges by citizen experts will be archived.</li>\n\n<li>\tReports on each knowledge integration exchange, generated by host nodes and experts will be archived.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\tReports will be synthesised into a publication, supplemented by input from external evaluators.</li>\n\n<li>\tPublication produced and disseminated.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<div>\n\nThe initial phase will establish local cohorts of peer-support for enterprise incubation.\n\n</div>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t4-8 incubatees identified at each node.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nAt each EKIP node contacts with local academic institutions will be pursued to provide opportunities for researchers to get involved.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\tAcademic researchers will be engaged to provide external evaluation of the project and to produce a report.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n \n\n<strong>At what scale will your idea operate initially and how do you think it can be implemented in another EU member state in the future?</strong>\n\nEKIP will bring an international dimension to local challenges. Conceived as a network of practice right from the start, the initial phase of the project will simply involve knowledge integration exchanges, evaluation and a publication. There will be 4 networked nodes, 12 knowledge integration exchanges, and one publication.\n\nAs this action takes place, EKIP will put in place resources to support cohorts of enterprising individuals at each local node that will engage in local mutual support and development of enterprises, social enterprises or sustainable social projects, assisted by ongoing business mentoring and facilitated group \u201chack sessions\u201d to solve problems for each enterprise.\n\nCohorts will include diverse, complimentary skills, and will be chosen for their potential to provide meaningful mutual support. We envisage that 4-8 participants will be engaged in the program at each node. Participation in the followup incubation phase will not be finalised until resources are identified to support the program.\n\n \n\n<strong>How do you think your idea could be sustained over the next five years?</strong>\n\n<div>\n\nEKIP proposes that regeneration of communities and economies is best achieved through self-help and peer-learning methodologies. The initial phase of the program, described here, involves knowledge integration through expert exchanges. This will lead to the consolidation of cohorts of participants at local centres.\n\nThe opportunity is to facilitate cohorts to network with each other between local centres, help, support and (as functioning enterprises emerge) trade with each other. While inexpensive for the scale of its ambitions, this program is not free. Facilitation of the network and provision of suitably equipped working contexts is key. EKIP may do this through:\n\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\tSeeking a large scale institutional lead to support a network bid for structural funds.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\tSeeking academic partnership to bid for research funds.</li>\n\n<li>\tCrowd-fund specific actions, such as product development and knowledge integration exchanges.</li>\n\n<li>\tDeveloping relationships with local strategic players. Visiting experts may add significant value by helping to broker these relationships.</li>\n\n<li>\tDevelop locally appropriate models for sustainable co-working spaces, drawing on the expertise of the EKIP network. We suspect that income from pop-up business incubators, located in rent-free redundant retail spaces may finance expenses associated with provision of facilities.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n \n\n<strong>What are the most important things you need to have in place to make your idea happen?</strong>\n\nEKIP has in place:\n\n<div>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\tPhysical contexts to host knowledge integration exchanges that bring local participants into contact with visiting experts, in which emerging technologies and practices can be explored.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\tLocal nodes, that are established independent nonprofit organisations with aligned interests and objectives.</li>\n\n<li>\tSkills and experience to support innovation and co-working practices.</li>\n\n<li>\tSkills and experience to coordinate and manage an international project.</li>\n\n<li>\tStrong interest from researchers who may add value to the insights gained.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<div>\n\nFor its first phase EKIP requires:\n\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\tLocal capacity to host expert visitors and maximise the benefits of knowledge integration exchanges.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\tCommitment from researchers to engage with, and independently evaluate EKIP.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<div>\n\nFor later phases EKIP requires:\n\n</div>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\tSufficient organisational capacity over time to test the potentials of enterprise incubation peer support in different contexts.</li>\n\n<li>\tSupport to develop the EKIP network further, particularly with regard to stable resourcing to allow the network to grow and thrive.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n \n\n\u20ac20000 will be allocated:\n\n<div>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\u20ac2000: One network meeting (4 node representatives).</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\u20ac12000: 12 Knowledge integration exchanges undertaken by engaged experts.</li>\n\n<li>\t\u20ac4000: Knowledge integration exchanges undertaken by node representatives.</li>\n\n<li>\t\u20ac2000 Management, coordination and publication.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n</div>", "created_at": "2017-08-08 13:48:10.129761", "updated_at": "2017-08-08 13:48:10.129761", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1383, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 16.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2551], "is_private": false}, {"id": 34175, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 6671, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hello all,\n\nBefore we go off or lose people for holidays (sic!) here is the progress we made during the past weeks with the festival organisation.

What are you working on and why are you on the Internet Days?**\n\nI work at the internet foundation where I lead the work with GOTO10, an open meeting place for innovation. I ended up there  2.5 years ago because I have a strong interest in the internet overall. We must open up the conversation between different spheres and groups and networks about the development and democracy of the Internet. \n\nI have previously lived almost half my life outside of Sweden. Most recently in Montreal, Canada. I want to root myself in Sweden again, at least for a while.\n\nFrom the beginning, my interest in the internet comes from understanding how we, as humans, coexist. My interest was communication. I went from studying European Studies, to thinking that it is great knowledge, but I need to understand how we co-exist, create institutions and make sense. It was another path - communication. Communication today is difficult to think about without thinking about the Internet.\n\nThen I did a master's in Montreal that had a strong focus on how internet-related communities work together to define the internet and what it should mean, like in the case what meaning we assign to freedom and other things.\n\nI am very interested in how we always try to negotiate with each other what freedom means. It's a very contextual topic. We have a different idea of \u200b\u200bfreedom if we talk about freedom of speech and freedom of opinion in the Nordic countries compared to North America, but also Asian countries and China, where we have a different relationship to individual / collective. I wondered how we negotiate that freedom when it comes to the internet. How do we negotiate it? What language do we use? It resonates with me. Looking a lot at encryption and the idea that encryption gives us some freedom.\n\nI think I first got interested in this ... it's such a clich\u00e9. It was probably high school when I read in 1984. I think questions about power, control, dystopia, authority and collectivity are super interesting. The idea of \u200b\u200bsurveillance is a subtle or hidden power factor that is difficult to relate to, because it is a machine between you and power. There is no human being who oppresses you directly, but the idea of \u200b\u200ba human being who can be behind a machine. How does it affects us, and how doe we understand freedom? I think that is very interesting. Freedom of speech, to think freely, and at the same time, how should we respect and give equal opportunities to everyone.\n\n**When did you last become hopeful or happy about the internet or its future?**\n\nthere are a lot of exciting developments, really. Do not want to name anything specific really, but precisely when trying to find solutions to problems, not just \"bullshit innovations\". We have incredible capacity, really.\n\nIt's not the technology I'm worried about. I'm really hopeful about technology, really. What I'm worried about is how we choose to use it. Something that makes me hopeful is that I see many people who want to do good and see technology that makes it possible. If we are thinking about how to meet the climate threat and build a safer internet, then of course. There is a lot of technology around this that you can use that we don't have to be so afraid of. If we take something more concrete - the trend that big tech companies, like Apple and others say, personal privacy is important. Whether they think it or do it to retain customers is irrelevant. The result is more secure communication. It is a positive development, that more people are aware that there are tools that can be used for more secure communication and such.\n\nRegarding the climate threat. there are so many layers. We can  see the internet as a coordinating tool where we can reach out to more people, to communities and talk about climate change, and how we can reach out locally. Even technically, with the help of technology, you can show, understand how best to change behaviors in a way that is manageable for everyone.\n\nI mean, many people follow the news, for example. It is not good to buy this or that item, it is not good for the environment. It's hard to know what is good and not good, how to live. Imagine if through all the big data that is available you could easily see what we should and should do, based on impact. We could better coordinate the efforts. The climate movement has been criticized for not getting that started. It has a boom with Greta, but what happens next? Many are waiting for opportunities to do something, but don't know what. We may be able to provide such opportunities more easily.\n\nIn the end, it's the people. there are so many opportunities. Just a question of how we use them.\n\n**When did the internet or its development make you angry, scared or worried?**\n\nI am scared and worried about how we should use the technology that exists when more people become scared and worried. When we are scared we tend to be more defensive, less welcoming and spread more evil really, more hate.\n\nThere are very powerful techniques today. It is a question of control, an extreme centralization of information and data collection to few companies. But also this trend that we want to feel safe in all circumstances. Like technologies such as Ring, where private individuals want to set up cameras to monitor their immediate area, with face recognition.\n\nBiometrics is also very difficult. Especially against vulnerable groups that need more protection. It can be abused in so many ways. Now that things are less stable politically and more fragile, it is sometimes scary when we have such powerful technology. We see this in various places in the world, shutting down the internet or other examples of how to monitor or find individuals who do not do what they are supposed to do, according to the authorities in the place.\n\nIt has not happened yet that someone has come to me with something that I thought they shouldn't do. The meeting place GOTO10 for the early stages, to test its idea and see what it can lead to. Usually people want what's good. Then you have to give everyone the same opportunity to try first and see what it can lead to. Some ideas go well, others don't, but everyone must have the same opportunity.\n\n*Do we have to work differently in order for new companies not to be naive?*\n\nYes, I hope that and companies are more aware. \"Move fast and break things\" was not a good idea. More people understand that you have to think about it from the start. So we have movements like Slow tech, that you should think more about regulation and all potential negative consequences such as a new innovation, a new technology can have for potential consequences. Whose problem is that I solve? Who do I solve a problem for? Is it a problem that I think all people encounter or if it is something I just meet. And who do I represent? A small group of people and quite privileged? Maybe you should ask and include people in that process from the start. More people are beginning to understand. It is crucial.\n\nThe fact that one talks about ethics in relation to technology development in studies, computer science and so on. Many academics have talked about it for a long time, especially those who haven't been in tech but have looked at tech from the outside. Like me, with communication or media studies, one looks at tech from a sociological focus with humans at the center in some way. You have to bring the two together, I think that is crucial. If you think about issues of responsibility. We have approached it in several keynote at the conference. Pilots, for example, are used as airbags when the autopilot does not work. The plane crashes because the pilot does not have enough  experience, but gets the responsibility for the crash. We have many such situations - who is responsible really?\n\nAnd with AI, it's really interesting to look at war zones. When used in weapons and drones. If they are not controlled by anyone, if they only have a target and it goes wrong, are the humans behind it free from responsibility? Is it the one who created the AI \u200b\u200bor the drone? Or the one who tells it to shoot? Of course, we have to think about these issues before we send out a drone. It is difficult, many think that the regulatory framework is too slow in relation to technology development. There we need more dialogue between decision makers and technology developers.\n\nThat's what we're trying to do here, bring together people in education, public development. Look at questions about how the web works. We want to discuss the impact of the Internet on society.", "created_at": "2019-11-26 15:59:42.725954", "updated_at": "2019-11-26 15:59:42.725954", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1538, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 31.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 66715, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 12081, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Hello @Emile and @JacobKarlsson, welcome!\n\nI also use Scuttlebutt.

If yes - can you tell us about this?** <br /> No solutions, really, but maybe three more things I should reflect on to 'debug' what hasn't worked so far:\n\n1. Expanding a remote team is not just an issue of onboarding, nor just a 'hiring' problem, but just as likely a management challenge (that I don't care enough about, hence it's being a problem?)\n\n2. To create new projects and business opportunities I still need to interface with organisations that ask for in-person meetings just to get to know/trust me. Which is a big drag, but ...how do I do without them?!\n\n3. The balance of incentives, financial and other ones, should be looked at... \n\n**Please, tell us about the best remote work experience you had up to this point:** \nBetween the two co-founders who are actively _on duty_, the workflow has been created organically and the tasks are naturally split between us. This means that, aside from marketing our products (which neither of us are personally interested in - quite a problem...) the technical component of creating and executing projects, even contracts for various clients, has mostly worked quite well for us, as in: we set a goal, we take our time, and get it done, being satisfied with the quality of the delivered work.\n\nWith our collaborators who are experts at remote and independent work, we normally have productive collaborations, that are continuing and deepening in nature (new joint ventures are created, which are very good signs).\n\nFinally, the main organisations active in hiking trails' development in Armenia are recurring clients for us; we have strong relationships with them based on personal knowledge and our ability to meet - so far - their expectations. And we hope we could keep it that way.\n\n**What are the most common problems/challenges you face with remote work in your organisation?**\nYou can see question number 2. <br /><br /> **On what kind of projects do you work?** <br /> Creating all sort of maps, especially topographic ones, both for printing and some interactive ones. We offer GIS services to support the nascent hiking industry in Armenia. <br /><br /> **How big is your organisation? How many collaborators do you work with remotely?** <br /> It's a fluid team: 3 co-founders, 2 are mainly active, and 2-6 people we regularly collaborate with. <br /><br /> **What is your role within your organisation - do you have a mandate or budget to invest in improving how your organisation does remote, distributed work?** <br /> I am leading the organisation, and no, we have no budget for that. <br /><br /> **What would be a reasonable budget for your team or organisation to invest into lowering risk of burnout of staff? ( Consider the lowering cost of unnecessary loss of staff time)** <br /> We don't have staff, we all work on a project-by-project basis, sort of paying ourselves by task, so I don't know how to answer really. <br /><br /> **Who would you have to convince for your organisation contribute towards our crowdfunding campaign?** <br /> Nobody. We ran a [successful crowdfunder in 2018](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/maps-for-hikers-dilijan-national-park-armenia#/), and I also participated in a botched one a few years ago.

We come from all walks of life to access interesting information, make new connections and collaborate. By sharing experiences with one another we turn our collective knowledge into useful advice to make better decisions for ourselves and our families in the near future. \n\nWe believe in citizen driven policy agendas, open research and inclusive opportunities for research respondents. We are committed to make it so that all our community projects result in concrete opportunities for members. \n\n## Why you, me and everyone we know should participate in the conversation WELLBEING IN EUROPE.\n\nWe go on a journey of discovery together. It begins here on the forum, and continues with events, work and opportunities for the most engaged contributors, all throughout 2019-2021. Events and tours all over Europe will enable us to discover one another and share constructive approaches. Anyone is welcome to participate! The steps are:\n\n1. Join our open access community! [Sign up here.](http://communities.edgeryders.eu)\n2. Introduce yourself [(+Add New Topic)](https://edgeryders.eu/c/wellbeing), how you are building your life and facing obstacles. Browse ongoing discussions, pick those you are passionate about, and leave constructive comments to support others in their quest.\n3. [Join a weekly virtual caf\u00e9](https://edgeryders.eu/t/register-for-an-online-gathering/9586/2) to meet other community members and participate in organising a global event.\n\n## What community participants can expect in return\n\n1. **We will feature your project, work, life story or any burning questions** you have, by including in our communications to the network spanning the globe (newsletters, social media etc.). If you need help creating and editing your story, the team can help you! ([example](https://edgeryders.eu/t/op3ncare-fellows-brussels-and-berlin-urban-activism-greek-agrifood-rewiring-cytostatics-shadow-delivery-in-romania/5713))\n2. **An invitation to a local meetup** happening around you. All events will have invitations posted here online. Due to limited number of places, priority will be offered to most active online participants by number of posts, comments and most importantly, acknowledgement by peers.\n3. **Possibility to get hired as a Local Connector or Topic Expert for the upcoming community Festival end of 2019** - we will be Local Connectors: facilitators and event planners organising the Festival in their village/city, and Experts who are summarizing and reflecting deeply on existing community conversations, on the basis of which they will be curating themes in the Festival.

Our <a href=\"https://edgeryders.eu/social-enterprise\">social enterprise</a> created in 2013 to act as our community's infrastructure is also becoming better at connecting our projects and initiatives for change to powerful, established organisations.\n\nAs part of this growth, we have outgrown our old Drupal 7 online platform. We are now decamping to a new platform that puts debate front and center. It is, as always, open source software, based on Discourse (<a href=\"https://github.com/edgeryders/discourse\">here</a> is the GitHub repo). It will take a bit of getting used to, but those involved in pre-testing adjusted very fast, and absolutely love it. Give it a try! \n\nHere is what you need to know:\n\n* Your edgeryders.eu login and password work as normal. One exception: if your username contains a whitespace, you will need to replace it with an underscore.

Your content is still acknowledged as yours, and you retain intellectual property rights on it. The Creative Commons Attribution license used on the old platform also is maintained for all content.\n\n* All links pointing to individual posts, wikis, events, pages etc. of the old platform still work, and now redirect to the imported content on the new one.\n\n* Mentions still work, like this: <em>@username </em>\n\nIf you have a question, problem or need hands on support we have an online chat room where you can drop in during the day: <a href=\"https://riot.im/app/#/room/#dev:edgeryders.eu\">#dev:edgeryders.eu</a>", "created_at": "2017-07-12 13:52:39", "updated_at": "2017-09-17 11:01:19.977503", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 368, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 11.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 35403, "user_id": 3799, "topic_id": 6892, "post_number": 6, "raw": "I too have been thinking for a while about the ideas similar to co-housing and co-working.

(przyp.: 64 l.). Jestem na emeryturze. Sko\u0144czy\u0142am podstaw\u00f3wk\u0119 Salezjan. Potem przeprowadzili\u015bmy si\u0119 do innej dzielnicy w 1969 r. P\u00f3\u017aniej by\u0142a zasadnicza szko\u0142a dziewiarska i technikum dziewiarskie. Po szkole pracowa\u0142am jako dziewiarz. Urodzi\u0142am c\u00f3rk\u0119. 10 lat nie pracowa\u0142am. Zacz\u0119\u0142am znowu pracowa\u0107 w 1986 roku w sklepie samopomocy ch\u0142opskiej przez 12 lat, a potem w drugim sklepie - 22 lata. By\u0142 taki okres, \u017ce mia\u0142am bardzo wysokie ci\u015bnienia, \u017ce przesz\u0142am na rent\u0119 na 3 lata. Wtedy zmieni\u0142am prac\u0119 na drugi sklep, bo to by\u0142 wtedy zak\u0142ad pracy chronionej. Chcia\u0142am by\u0107 na produkcji, ale wzi\u0119li mnie na si\u0142\u0119 do sklepu. Wydawa\u0142o mi si\u0119, \u017ce na produkcji b\u0119d\u0119 mia\u0142a spokojn\u0105 g\u0142ow\u0119. Zrobi\u0119 i idzie cz\u0142owiek do domu, nie my\u015bli. W sklepie to tak r\u00f3\u017cnie. Mam niepe\u0142nosprawno\u015b\u0107 lekk\u0105. Akurat brakowa\u0142o im pracownik\u00f3w w sklepie. By\u0142 8 godzinny czas pracy. Z pocz\u0105tku soboty by\u0142 pracuj\u0105ce. P\u0142acili wi\u0119cej za nie. Mog\u0142am nie pracowa\u0107 w soboty. By\u0142a osoba na zmian\u0119. W samopomocy by\u0142o r\u00f3\u017cnie. Brakowa\u0142o pieni\u0119dzy to obcinali nam wynagrodzenie do 70% przez 2 miesi\u0105ce. Oczywi\u015bcie za nasz\u0105 zgod\u0105. To by\u0142a sp\u00f3\u0142dzielnia, wi\u0119c mieli\u015bmy g\u0142os w tej sprawie. Z\u0142o\u017cy\u0142am deklaracj\u0119 cz\u0142onkowsk\u0105, ale jak odchodzi\u0142am nie by\u0142o pieni\u0119dzy do podzia\u0142u. To dzia\u0142a do tej pory. Jako cz\u0142onkowie mieli\u015bmy prawo g\u0142osu i decyzji. Odbywa\u0142y si\u0119 walne zebrania raz w roku. Np.: dawali\u015bmy prawo takie, \u017ce prezes zostaje, jak sp\u00f3\u0142dzielnia ma funkcjonowa\u0107, co mo\u017cemy zmieni\u0107. Sami ustalali\u015bmy, \u017ce - jak du\u017co pracowni\u0107 sz\u0142o na macierzy\u0144ski i wraca\u0142y - zmniejszamy odprawy, zatrudniamy pracownik\u00f3w na ich miejsce i na jaki okres. W sp\u00f3\u0142dzielni by\u0142o ok. 50 os\u00f3b. Na zebraniu byli wszyscy. Drugi sklep te\u017c by\u0142 sp\u00f3\u0142dzielni\u0105 pracy, jak tam przesz\u0142am. Byli tam udzia\u0142owcy z du\u017cymi udzia\u0142ami w firmie. Dobre pieni\u0105dze za to wzi\u0119li tak, \u017ce mieszkania sobie za to pokupowali. Kiedy tam przesz\u0142am ju\u017c nie przyjmowali w poczet cz\u0142onk\u00f3w. Prezes, odchodz\u0105c na emerytur\u0119, sprzeda\u0142 to. Sp\u00f3\u0142dzielnia zosta\u0142a sprywatyzowana w 2013/2014 roku. Tam by\u0142o ok. 1 200 os\u00f3b, z czego po\u0142owa to udzia\u0142owcy. Mieli co roku dywidendy od zysku. By\u0142y te\u017c dla pracownik\u00f3w na pocz\u0105tku. Nam troszk\u0119 skapn\u0119\u0142o, a potem ju\u017c nie. Jako pracownice mia\u0142y\u015bmy udzia\u0142 w zysku, jaki\u015b tam procent. Potem si\u0119 to urwa\u0142o. Nie widz\u0119 r\u00f3\u017cnicy dla siebie po 1989 r. Zarobki zawsze najni\u017csze prawie. Tyle \u017ce w sklepach mog\u0142am kupi\u0107 co si\u0119 chcia\u0142o. Nic si\u0119 nie zmieni\u0142o ani z mieszkaniem ani z niczym. Tyle tylko, \u017ce wyje\u017cd\u017ca\u0107 mo\u017cna by\u0142o. Cz\u0142owiek si\u0119 wolniejszy zrobi\u0142. Nie podpisywa\u0142, \u017ce musi i\u015b\u0107 1-go maja na poch\u00f3d. Wynagrodzenie nigdy nie wystarcza\u0142o na \u017cycie. Zawsze by\u0142 z tym problem. Tym bardziej, \u017ce sama c\u00f3rk\u0119 wychowywa\u0142am. Rozesz\u0142am si\u0119 z m\u0119\u017cem, jak c\u00f3rka mia\u0142a 10 lat. Rodzice jeszcze byli to mnie troszk\u0119 wsparli. Mieszka\u0142y\u015bmy z c\u00f3rk\u0105 w tej samej kamienicy co zaraz po \u015blubie z m\u0119\u017cem. Z przychod\u00f3w nie wi\u0119cej ni\u017c 1/4 sz\u0142a na czynsz, ale co miesi\u0105c trzeba by\u0142o my\u015ble\u0107 sk\u0105d wzi\u0105\u0107. Tam taki gospodarz by\u0142 co nie zdziera\u0142. Stara\u0142am si\u0119 ca\u0142y czas o mieszkanie komunalne. Za du\u017co by\u0142o pieni\u0119dzy, \u017ceby je dosta\u0107, a za ma\u0142o, \u017ceby kredyt wzi\u0105\u0107. Teraz si\u0119 mieszcz\u0119, bo podnie\u015bli kryterium dochodowe, ale emerytur\u0119 ca\u0142y czas o par\u0119 groszy podnosz\u0105 i wraz to dochodzi do tego momentu. Teraz mam 1 570 z\u0142 netto emerytury, a czynsz wynosi 260 z\u0142, wydaj\u0119 ok. 100 z\u0142 na leki. \n\nNa lekarza si\u0119 czeka, \u017ceby darmo by\u0142o. Nie chodz\u0119 prywatnie. Na prze\u015bwietlenie \u017cy\u0142 szyjnych czeka\u0142am p\u00f3\u0142 roku a\u017c zapomnia\u0142am o tym. Mia\u0142y zadzwoni\u0107 z terminem, jak lekarz b\u0119dzie. Zadzwoni\u0142y, ale nie dosta\u0142am si\u0119, bo mia\u0142am by\u0107 na 13:00, o 12:15 ju\u017c by\u0142am pod przychodni\u0105, ale zadzwoni\u0142y, \u017ce przykro im, ale \u017cebym nie jecha\u0142a, bo lekarz ju\u017c wyszed\u0142.  Na nast\u0119pn\u0105 wizyt\u0119 czeka\u0142am ok. 3 tygodni, ale akurat mnie nie by\u0142o i nie posz\u0142am. To by\u0142o w ubieg\u0142ym roku. Lekarze przyjd\u0105 aby odb\u0119bni\u0107, aby szybciej, aby szybciej... Najlepiej jak si\u0119 przychodzi tylko leki przed\u0142u\u017cy\u0107 i si\u0119 wychodzi. Jak rozmawiam, \u017ce po lekach si\u0119 gorzej czuj\u0119, to m\u00f3wi: nie, to nie po lekach. Jak nie po lekach, jak spr\u00f3bowa\u0142am miesi\u0105c nie bra\u0107 i by\u0142o ca\u0142kiem inaczej. Nie zmienili mi lek\u00f3w, chocia\u017c w opisach jest, \u017ce sporo os\u00f3b ma takie dolegliwo\u015bci. Mam problemy z kr\u0105\u017ceniem i uk\u0142adem oddechowym. Jak wchodz\u0119 pod g\u00f3r\u0119, mam zadyszk\u0119, ale badania wysi\u0142kowe dobrze mi wysz\u0142y. To jest \u015bmieszne, ale w ko\u0144cu cz\u0142owiekowi nie chce si\u0119 i\u015b\u0107 do tego lekarza. \n\nC\u00f3rka uczy\u0142a si\u0119 w liceum gastronomicznym. Na pocz\u0105tku mia\u0142a kontakt z ojcem, a potem ju\u017c nie. To by\u0142 alkoholik. Wstydzi\u0142a si\u0119. Chodzi\u0142a te\u017c do szk\u00f3\u0142 policealnych. Zrobi\u0142a sobie studium ksi\u0119gowo\u015bci i w tym zawodzie pracuje. By\u0142a ze mn\u0105 prawie do 2010 r. Urodzi\u0142a c\u00f3rk\u0119 i przeprowadzi\u0142a si\u0119 do swojego m\u0119\u017ca. Te\u015bciowa jej pomog\u0142a i kupili sobie mieszkanie. Mieszka\u0142y\u015bmy w jednym pokoju 17 m. kw. Jak c\u00f3rka robi\u0142a prawo jazdy i instruktor chcia\u0142 j\u0105 podwie\u017a\u0107 pod dom, umawia\u0142a si\u0119 z nim ulic\u0119 dalej ko\u0142o parku. Do tej pory jej zosta\u0142o, \u017ce gorsza jest. Potem w\u0142a\u015bcicielka pozwoli\u0142a nam na g\u00f3rze sobie zrobi\u0107, je\u015bli chcemy. Wyremontowa\u0142am mieszkanie pi\u0119tro wy\u017cej i musia\u0142am zostawi\u0107 zaraz. C\u00f3rka dwa lata by\u0142a w Anglii. Chcia\u0142am, \u017ceby po powrocie mieszka\u0142a sama, ale pomieszka\u0142a tam tylko ze trzy lata. \n\nTak \u017cy\u0142am. Pracowa\u0142am, je\u017adzi\u0142am do wnuczki, a potem do mamy, bo trzeba by\u0142o pomaga\u0107. Mia\u0142am dzia\u0142k\u0119 pracownicz\u0105. Jak zrobili wiadukt, spowodowa\u0142 \u017ce woda sta\u0142a na dzia\u0142kach. Teraz pojad\u0119 do siostry, do brata na dzia\u0142k\u0119, bardzo cz\u0119sto do wnuczki \u2013 odporowadzam, przyprowadzam. Teraz jak m\u0142odzi ca\u0142y dzie\u0144 nie pracuj\u0105, to na czynsz nie maj\u0105. Musz\u0105 sobie dodatkowe prace bra\u0107. W TBS (przyp.: Towarzystwo Budownictwa Spo\u0142ecznego) s\u0105. Teraz maj\u0105 ok. 1 100 z\u0142 czynszu za 67 m kw. \n\nWierz\u0105ca jestem, ale ma\u0142o praktykuj\u0105ca. Modl\u0119 si\u0119 w domu czasami. Jak tak s\u0142ysz\u0119 o aferze pedofilskiej w ko\u015bciele, to mnie ponosi zaraz. Jak sobie przemy\u015bl\u0119, to tak samo i arty\u015bci i te grupy... to tak samo tam jest przecie\u017c. Cz\u0142owiek ma takie zaufanie \u017ce ksi\u0105dz to jest ksi\u0105dz; powinien by\u0107 zaufany, to spowiednik. A nie ma ju\u017c tego zaufania. Tyle lat rodzice prowadzali do ko\u015bcio\u0142a, czasem trzeba by\u0142o wygania\u0107. Czasami cz\u0142owiek musi wierzy\u0107, bo nie ma kto pom\u00f3c. Pami\u0119tam jak c\u00f3rka by\u0142a bardzo chora... posz\u0142am i si\u0119 pomodli\u0142am. Jak wr\u00f3ci\u0142am mama m\u00f3wi: dziecko ona p\u00f3\u0142 butelki zjad\u0142a. A od tygodnia prawie nic nie jad\u0142a. Uwierzy\u0142am, \u017ce to przez modlitw\u0119. Jestem w takim \u015brodowisku, \u017ce jedni chodz\u0105 do ko\u015bcio\u0142a, inni nie. W rodzinie tak samo. \n\nO polityce si\u0119 u nas w rodzinie rozmawia. Czasami k\u0142\u00f3tliwie. Nas jest siedmioro. Jak si\u0119 spotkamy, to si\u0119 k\u0142\u00f3cimy. My te\u017c jeste\u015bmy podzieleni. Jak si\u0119 popatrzy, wszyscy robi\u0105 tak samo i cz\u0142owiek ma tak samo. Nic si\u0119 nie zmienia, a partie si\u0119 zmieniaj\u0105. K\u0142\u00f3cimy si\u0119: jedni o PIS, drudzy o PO, teraz to znowu o inne partie. Tak jak zaczniemy, to potem ju\u017c nie wiadomo od czego si\u0119 zacz\u0119\u0142o. Jeden brat m\u00f3wi\u0142, \u017ce poszed\u0142by do polityki, ale nie. On by si\u0119 nadawa\u0142. Pracuje w funduszach unijnych. Pomagaj\u0105 zdoby\u0107 zak\u0142adom jak najwi\u0119cej. U nas to si\u0119 tak zmienia z wybor\u00f3w na wybory. G\u0142osuj\u0119, mo\u017ce niepotrzebnie nawet... Bo jak cz\u0142owiek zag\u0142osuje na PIS to nic nie b\u0119dzie mia\u0142, i jak na PO to te\u017c nic nie b\u0119dzie mia\u0142. Nowoczesna mnie denerwuje, bo oni tak chc\u0105 tylko si\u0119 wylansowa\u0107 i trafi\u0107 na lepsze sto\u0142ki. Im chyba o to tylko chodzi. Nie wiem czy to nie wszystkim o to chodzi. Kukiz' 15 mi si\u0119 podoba, bo logicznie m\u00f3wi\u0105 i nie rw\u0105 tych pieni\u0119dzy, tej w\u0142adzy i mi si\u0119 wydaje, \u017ce s\u0105 tacy przekonuj\u0105cy. Nie, \u017ceby da\u0107, tylko pom\u00f3c, pozmienia\u0107 te przepisy, \u017ceby nie mo\u017cna by\u0142o robi\u0107 tak jak robi\u0105 do tej pory niekt\u00f3rzy: i ze szko\u0142\u0105, i z lekarzem, z nauczycielami. G\u0142osowa\u0142am raz na Platform\u0119, raz na PIS, jak mnie Platforma zdenerwowa\u0142a. Nie jestem politykiem, \u017ceby rozumie\u0107 co oni kombinuj\u0105. Zrobi tak, a potem powie, \u017ce zrobi\u0142 inaczej.   Bezczelnie m\u00f3wi, \u017ce bia\u0142e jest czarne. Chcia\u0142abym, \u017ceby mieszkania by\u0142y dla m\u0142odych, bo to tragedia nie mie\u0107 mieszkania; wi\u0119ksze pobory, \u017ceby mogli zr\u00f3wna\u0107 dzieci w tych szko\u0142ach, bo jedni zarabiaj\u0105 nie wiadomo ile... \n\nWnuczka jest w 3 klasie. Zmiana w edukacji nie bardzo mnie dotyczy. Ona si\u0119 bardzo dobrze uczy, ale za du\u017co jest tego wszystkiego: ci\u0119\u017ckie plecaki, du\u017co zaj\u0119\u0107 i lekcji w domu. Nie ma czasu na rozwijanie swoich zainteresowa\u0144. Jak zacznie malowa\u0107, to nie odrobi lekcji. Tak jak pos\u0142ucha\u0107, \u017ce dzieci na zachodzie nie nosz\u0105 ksi\u0105\u017cek, maj\u0105 r\u00f3\u017cne ko\u0142a zainteresowa\u0144, dzieci mog\u0105 wybiera\u0107, a tu jak nie op\u0142aci cz\u0142owiek, to dziecko nie idzie. A tu op\u0142aca\u0107 trzeba jedno, drugie, trzecie, obiady w szko\u0142ach... Ile tych pieni\u0119dzy trzeba miesi\u0119cznie mie\u0107 tylko na to? Edukacja jest droga, \u017ceby dzieci podgoni\u0107 do inych, \u017ceby nie by\u0142o takich r\u00f3\u017cnic. Wnuczka chodzi na angielski prywatnie i teraz sama chce na drugi \u2013 w\u0142oski. Za sam angielski p\u0142ac\u0105 180 zl miesi\u0119cznie \u2013 lekcje s\u0105 dwa razy w tygodniu po dwie godziny. \n\nBa\u0142agan w Polsce mnie denerwuje najbardziej. Ogl\u0105dam TVN, TVP info czasami, czytam na facebooku informacje. Cz\u0142owiek nic nie wie, nie jest pewny, nikomu nie mo\u017ce uwierzy\u0107. Nie wiadomo za kim by\u0107, kto lepiej by to wszystko zrobi\u0142. Wszyscy chc\u0105 zrobi\u0107 dobrze, ka\u017cdy m\u00f3wi to samo, tylko jak dojdzie do w\u0142adzy... By\u0142a niepewno\u015b\u0107 i jest. Za Wa\u0142\u0119s\u0105 ka\u017cdy kiedy\u015b g\u0142osowa\u0142, a teraz w \u017cyciu nie zag\u0142osowa\u0142abym na Wa\u0142\u0119s\u0119. Oszuka\u0142. Dopcha\u0142 si\u0119 do w\u0142adzy, g\u0142upoty m\u00f3wi i tyle. G\u0142upoty robi\u0142. Nie wiem czy on sam to wymy\u015bli\u0142. Nie wierz\u0119. Elektryk zwyk\u0142y nie potrafi rz\u0105dzi\u0107 pa\u0144stwem. Mia\u0142 doradc\u00f3w i rz\u0105dzili za niego. W\u0142adza ma du\u017ce poparcie w ko\u015bcio\u0142ach. Z tym\u017ce m\u0142odzi te\u017c s\u0105 za PISem, bo troch\u0119 mo\u017ce i dostali, a ka\u017cdemu brakuje. 500 plus \u2013 tak jak i Kukiz m\u00f3wi - powinno by\u0107 dla tych, co naprawd\u0119 potrzebuj\u0105. Niekt\u00f3rzy dobrze je wydaj\u0105, a niekt\u00f3rzy aby czekaj\u0105. a dzieci jak nie mia\u0142y tak nie maj\u0105. U nas jest za ma\u0142o to sprawdzane. Id\u0105 du\u017ce pieni\u0105dze, a pomoc jest niewielka. Chocia\u017c to te\u017c mnie denerwuje, tak jak to chyba M\u0142ynarska powiedzia\u0142a: nad morzem si\u0119 roz\u0142o\u017cy\u0142o 500 plus \u2013 patologia.

In practical terms, however, there comes a moment when revisiting the vision becomes counter productive to progress. \u00a0\n\nA powerful vision that inspires is extremely important in motivating engagement. In the context of a co-creative impact initiative, ideally many stakeholders will be engaged in developing that vision, maybe even beginning the work to move toward it. As the initiative gains momentum, more people might be included down the line. If each time more people become involved you have to stop to co-create the vision again, there's a risk of undermining the work that's already been done, and devaluing the input of those who participated in earlier stages.\u00a0\n\nPerhaps the challenge is not to include every possible stakeholder in co-creating a vision, but developing a vision which makes room for building on co-creative inputs and energies at many stages. <a href=\"http://ci2iglobal.com/phasing-and-flows-of-co-creativity/\" target=\"_blank\">What Jean wrote</a> about co-creative process being present in phases really resonated with me.\n\nIf you're trying to \"sell\" co-creation as a way to achieve greater impact, I think it's dangerously limiting to propose that we have to start from scratch every time.

We belong to a species that has driven the megafauna to extinction wherever it touched land \u2013 and we are not speaking of modern adventurers with guns, but of hunters-gatherers with spears. That, according to the latest interpretations of archaeological evidence, existed in an almost constant state of warfare to keep density below one person per square mile (reference one, reference two). That has an innate preference for in-group individuals (\"those like us, not those others\"), demonstrated by research on children as young as six months (this is the biological kernel of racism and discrimination \u2013 and we all have it). This is rape, not harmony. Extraction, it seems, is at the very core of our species's success. Non-extractive homo have gone extinct. We are the descendants of the best slash-and-burners.\n[/quote]\n\nI personally would really push back on this sentiment @alberto, but I can very much see where you are coming from. Perhaps when I see you in person we can do a discuss more. \n\nOn here, I would suggest that through certain lenses, the best slash and burners of all time is one way to frame it, but we conceptualize a \"non-extractive\" homo would take it too far. I would argue that our human social abilities enables us at a group level to shape this world dramatically, but always, ALWAYS, subject to the laws of physics. Slash and Burn was one such technique, and one a planet with less than a million humans, it's practice probably weren't dramatic because the biomass and ecosystems of Earth could accommodate and might even have anticipated, needed this human phenomenon to occur for other life to emerge. This is not some sort of veiled \"destruction breeds creation\" American Neo-Conservative agenda, though I can see the overlap, this is one part of a larger history that has been for the most part erased from our collective consciousness. What I would call standard narrative. Slash and burning at different scales/different times produce different results, and it was one of many techniques used. We are also the best reforestors, animal migration pattern enforcers, hunters, seed spreaders, etc etc. America is a place where the story of human's actively managing and ensuring huge biodiversity and thriving has been suppressed, this is the story of the Indigenous people's who were largely decimated by the arrival of small pox. With the second wave of European immigration occured, they happened upon the most lush forests and largest Bison herds (due to decades of no culling) that this concept of \"Pristine Nature\" emerged, an environment free of humans (which it never was) that, I would argue very strongly, is retroactively framed by our dominant industrial complexed history to confirm the myth that makes what we do possible: Humans are inherently opposed to the ecosystems that sustain us. \n\nNothing could be farther from the \"truth\", and we will definitely get into this, I'm pretty \"Post-Truth\" at this point, we choose the narratives we represent, But one major vein of our work here at Biosphere(x) is to recover fragments of these forgotten narratives to counter the notion that \"where humans go, megafauna disappear.\" Causation, Correlation depend the frameworks that inhabit us when we are exposed to this phrase. I would argue that megafauna are still around, though I would love to have seen Giant Sloths and Giraffes outside of central and southern Africa roaming, it is systems, not humans, which has led to the unprecedented extinction events, as well as collapse of microfauna habitats around the planet. Humans are vessels, what organisms inhabit them? Besides the billions of gut bacteria along for the ride @eimhin,  I can see certain ideas coordinating millions for certain end goals. It's these ideas, which has scaled beyond anything before, which presents to challenges for us. Human Nature is not as malevolent or anti-nature as we see on movie screens or read about in standard narrative fiction/non-fiction/journalism (My opinion is that there is far too few attacks on the systems that drive us to short sighted progressions, we have names for them such as capitalism, patriarchy, totalitarian agriculture etc etc, but these suggest a compartmentalization of the issues, where as the memetic organisms are as multidimensional as you or me, and the problem is they are invisible to our eyes for the most part) Our will to survive and reproduce is not a sin nor commendable, but it's universal intra and extra-species. The fact that humans within our culture of industrial complexes has been able to replace like 80-90% of the biomass on the Earth's Surface with ones of our choosing is Disturbing to no end~ but the feed back loop that causes this isn't inherently part of our nature. If you need examples of human beings who don't live in the shadow of our culture and practice ways of life completely integral to their environments, I would consult with anthropologists, since I'm not one. \n\nThis is not a call towards \"primitivism\". There are very real reasons why the stories of humans living as one with nature aren't common. They don't scale well in the face of disease and military/economic pressures our culture has more than enough of. I would say that's the challenge, how to navigate and repurpose suppressed and non-scalable views for the future which really really needs them.", "created_at": "2017-09-15 13:59:14.309206", "updated_at": "2017-09-15 14:01:44.083381", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 941, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 51.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [35118], "is_reply_to": [35118], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20239, "user_id": 3379, "topic_id": 688, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>mont soleil...MOUNTAIN OF SUN!!!</b>\n\nwell not all the time but we get the most sun in swiss..thats why we have the first solar park in europe here...\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nright..about the project. essentially we are a synergy hub for people who see that we need to strengthen the parallel reality..the \" normal\" - we work together\u00a0to make these dreams come true... why do we protest? why do get angry at things? - ...and what good is that going to do when you know how the world is governed... that most of all we see is preplanned and we are just going along for the ride?// well... thats changing... people are waking up to the matrix... and yes... we are making a differnece..and yes we are turning back the tide... our quiet revolution is gaining momentum... and the establishment suddenly realise they wont have everything their own way anymore... we have a long - a very long way to go to raise the consiciousness....but we are doing it here...and with YOUR help... we can make this the EPI centre of that change...\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/4/4a618ec0ae4e4f90badb8b95af8b66c16ed05adc.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\">\n\n", "created_at": "2016-08-29 12:10:46", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:52.681095", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 227, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 75090, "user_id": 4640, "topic_id": 13312, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Interesting model. Pure mathematics. I'm skeptical of the extent to which it applies to real economies. Yes, Piketty has proven to us that there has been concentration of wealth in Europe & the US among an oligopoly during periods when there is not massive economic dislocation (in other words, the big exceptions were the Great Depression and World Wars I & II). My feeling (I do not know of work on this -- can anyone recommend something?) is that this is a consequence of human psychology rather than maths. In other words, people are more likely to carry out transactions with people that they know than with strangers. This means that a smallish group end up becoming the oligarchs, and this is because they know a lot of people and have the personality characteristics that enable them to impress many of those people that they are likely to be beneficial to do business with. I think this also is a major reason why the dominant ethnicity in a given society maintains its dominance: they deal with each other mostly, and less so with people of a different ethnicity. By the way, I also see this as being the source of the cleverness of the originally Japanese export-led growth of the 20th century. It matters, of course, that you have cheap labor and all that, because you need to present a clear reason why a European or American businessman would deal with you and not with a local supplier.

I am forwarding over a few thoughts/resources I sent to Noemi and Isabelle already, so that it's all in one place. These are specifically around impact investing and social value in the coliving sector: \n\n1. [Venn](http://www.venn.city), a Tel Aviv based coliving operator has received impact investing from [Bridges Fund Israel](https://bridgesisrael.com/venn/). Here is their [2019 Impact Report](https://39q77k1dd7472q159r3hoq5p-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/impactreport2019.pdf) as a reference.\n2. [Mason & Fifth](https://www.mason-fifth.com/), a new upscale 'well-living' coliving space in London received investment from 'purpose-driven real estate investment firm' [FORE](https://forepartnership.com/). \n3. [KOIS](https://www.koisinvest.com/about-us), which is Brussels based, is another impact-driven asset management firm. I believe they are in talks with [Cohabs](https://cohabs.com/) (Brussels biggest coliving company as of now), based on shared connections I've noticed on LinkedIn. \n4. It's also interesting to look into other purpose-driven/community minded property developers, such as the [Office of Holistic Urbanism](https://ohu.nz/) (Ohu) in Christchurch, NZ and [Stories](https://www.stories.partners/) in London. Ohu are the ones I was talking about that have raised over 500k NZD through equity crowdfunding for their [Collet's Corner](https://ohu.nz/portfolio-item/colletts-corner/) coliving project. Here you can see a [public register of all their shareholders](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gvg8Utnj2Be0kVRCiaaCMXmTBFq3ILO6v1RE3HVRwGw/edit#gid=0) to date and a [deep dive of their model](https://www.pledgeme.co.nz/investments/347-collett-s-corner) on their PledgeMe page. Stories really focuses on 'social value', or the economic, social and environmental impact of their spaces. Here is a great resource on [social value from the UK Green Building Council](https://www.ukgbc.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Social-Value.pdf). Here is an article I wrote about [social value in coliving](https://www.theccd.org/articles/social-value-coliving-how-can-coliving-providers-embed-social-economic-and-environmental-impact), where you can find some info about impact measuring tools, such as [SoPact](https://www.sopact.com/).\n\nthink that these are useful for thinking about different governance models for The Reef.

Eg. funds, corporate sponsors. Could we make decision work better? Could we make progressive funds (ie. escalating over time based on success)\n\u201cWhat do you think about decreasing expenses, rather than increasing prices?\u201d We still need to be able to give developers enough to survive.\nTypes of open source: eg. libraries, Mastodon,\n\nQ: Why is \u2018freemium\u2019 not viable? A: hard to implement it in a way that does not limit the use. Only works for software as a service. How about other services?\nAre we looking at a new emerging way of open source? License 0 (ie. if you\u2019re not a company and not making money off of it, it\u2019s free). Parroting license - due diligence. Would make it possible for commercial users to be forced to pay for it.\nA business model problem - we need good coders in bulk. Coders need to pay the rent. Rent is going up. Coders don\u2019t want to be martyrs. Commercial employers pay well. How do you get enough money into a project to make it great?\n\nQ: What types of open source projects are struggling with funding. Open source does not give return of investment for investors. Funders necessarily need to not be expecting direct returns.\n\u2018Bundlesource\u2019 \u2018board of users\u2019 that can take decisions on prioritizing features.\n\u2018Tragedy of the commons\u2019 half of our fundings come from one person who is on a monthly donation. Most other donors give small donations.\nEg. John says he gives up to 5\u20ac a month, but only 1\u20ac a month pr. one other person who also donate 1\u20ac a month. If 5 people also give 5\u20ac a month, they all give 5\u20ac a month.\n\nQ: Whcih business model for software is thriving? A: ads, venture capital, software as a service.\nQ: What donation model works best? A: patreon, governments,  **churches** . Create a religion and make billionaires pay a shitload of money.\nDiscussing the potential for developers go on an international coding strike.\nAs a coder, if we are faced with the option between getting really well paid and doing what you believe in - it\u2019s hard.\nIf stakeholders are small, independent people - does propaganda/outreach have a role to play? Could expand the base of donors. More users also mean more bug-fixing for individual people - lots of legwork.\nHow is open source understood: \u2018The code that makes up the product is publicly available. The product itself is sometimes free too\u2019.\nIf open source starts getting public traction, lobbyism starts becoming an opportunity. Microsoft is lobbying for their cases, open sources needs theirs.\nHb open source government? Resource allocation problem\nGovernments are becoming more fluent in understanding how data affects the public space. Very reactionary, not very progressive.\nScuttlebutt is aiming to find ways to live with decreased expenses (ie. less dependency on dominant system) to give more space for creating an alternative.\nThe movement needs salespeople! Churches are being successful raising money\nOpen source does offer the individual return of investment for the developer in terms of offering value to the community, which offers both a sense of purpose for the developer and goodwill from the community. To monetize this\nIdea of making a documentary about open source. There\u2019s a powerful narrative in offering an alternative to facebook, google, etc. \u2018We don\u2019t actually need any of it\u2019. Point: raised awareness does not necessarily create. Lots of people are concerned about privacy.\n\n## Main takeaways\nOrganize an open source strike\nincrease solidarity\nCreate a documentary to inform people\nStart a religion, lobbying group\nIncentivized donations (bigger donations give bigger rights? patreon)\n\nFeedback from audience: Great idea with religion - religion is the opposite of economy, a place where exchange is not measured. Religion is mostly focused on  *giving service*", "created_at": "2019-12-02 16:06:26.580351", "updated_at": "2020-12-11 14:41:54.295852", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 680, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 82.0, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4934, 5620, 4897], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25823, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 2272, "post_number": 13, "raw": "<b>Confirmed.</b>\n\nI also cross-checked this, and it seems to me too that Arthur is right.

'Understanding how societies organize. \n'Discuss these topics with new people. \n'I like the subject and was intrigued by the pitch and discuss that with other people. \n'How decisions are made in society - where most conflicts lie. \n'Fascinated by governance: one of the challenges of our time is agreeing what we do, in the context of a global system. \n'Non-violent communication, human connection rather than tech. Reorganizing human relationships as most effective.\n'Most of our challenges seem to often meet the challenge of governance. Lots of respect for where we've come to today, but I'm curious to see how we can make it better - improving transparency and __ using technology. \nGovernance and organization is central to many things. Let's do it in a better and healthier way- requires more thinking and experimentation\nLiquid democracy, cyndicalism. Exploring how scuttelbutt can organize in a distributed way. \nI'm usually very result-oriented, getting things done. One thing i like which is not that is organizational gruop processes.\n\n\n**Mapping the baseline of political polcymaking**\nDevelopment: Who - Thinktanks, political parties, corporate forces, lobbyism, (systemic prerequisites). How - comes up with a proposal. process is opaque, not very clear. (Where do I want to participate? Eg machine standards do not interest me, but certain companies are very interested by that)\nDeciding: who: small group of professional politicians, elected as representatives by the general publich with utilized voting rights. How: binary y/n approve/reject, with some room for minor adaptation of proposals\nImplementing: who: civil service and municipalities - most cases these are made up by professionals who are not political in function. how: translating the national proposal to a particular context of their own.\n\n**Imaging the desired future of governance and policymaking**\n1 minute for individual reflection\n3 minutes for brief conversation in pairs\n10 minutes for brief conversation in groups of four, focused on sharing proposals.\n2 minutes for groups to formulate Takeaways from convo's into framework\nPresentations and wrap up\n\nGroup 1: (Kristian etc)\n The people that are involved and directly affected by the decision should be making it. Relevant for all stages in terms of who does it. \nOrganizing locally is important. Asking a representative to tell me what to do does not work. Ants can organize without a governor. How can we create messaging that makes roles/titles superflouos in filling a function?\nI was mostly complaining. Newer methods of communication to enable participation. Challenge: apathy towards participation. Great to see that change with a sense of empowerment (and incentive? what incentive?) Transparency should be easy with the tools we have available. \nParticipatory democracy as a form of democratic duty. You're made to go (forced) and decide. This is already implemented in Mongolia. \n\nGroup 2: (alex, )\nIf people CAN participate, there are still barriers of interest. Knowledge, level of information. Across all stages, how do we engage people who are not being paid? Feeling of ownership. Tracking your impact should be possible. Gap between those who do this full time and those who not. \nMore iteration, updating the current system. Democracy (in Sweden) has not changed dramatically since the 1800's. \nCitizens Assemblies could be a viable form.\nProposals should be transparten, possible for anyone to comment on. Makes clar who suggested what and who made what changes. \n\nGroup 3: (Kim etc)\nDevelopment, decision making and implementation should be done by the people who are affected by it the most. \nThe people who are the most engaged in an issue is usually updated and knowledgeable. \nCitizens Assmeblies, direct democracy, sociocracy. Good enough for now, safe enough to try. Not based on majority vote, instead the concept of 'consent' (ie. lack of objections means proposals is approved). \nSystemic prerequisites - in any system, there are preceding (nested) systems that determines how the system is operating. '(Direct Demoracy' is now a party in sweden.) Eg. in the context of this workshop, it was the conference organizers and workshop organizers developed and decided most variables.

All of those countries (and perhaps also Ireland) could profit from having their own version of local money as proposed by Andresen in his paper.\u00a0\n\nAnd yes, you are right, the locality of the currency, i.e. the non-functionality in international trade, would be a necessary pre-condition to its functioning as a local stimulant of economic activity.\n\nSocial locality is another, and very interesting, concept. It goes way beyond the borders of countries and enters into the lion's den, so to speak. It is international yet local in the sense that only certain types of people, and perhaps only for certain types of interactions, will use that kind of currency. Yet it is a real currency separate and distinct from the state-backed bank-issued currencies that are the rage today. That is really what I am proposing in\u00a0<a href=\"http://blog.hasslberger.com/2012/02/occupy_money_-_the_case_for_so.html\">http://blog.hasslberger.com/2012/02/occupy_money_-_the_case_for_so.html</a>\u00a0where I stress the need for the development of a separate infrastructure that can take care of transfers and the keeping-track of the currency, may it be called credits or some other name. This will stimulate economic activity in that sector of the economy that is fed up with hard money for ideological reasons, either to do with the exploitation that comes with it, or in disagreement with the environmentally destructive or otherwise odious disposition of the major holders and users of that kind of currency.\n\nBoth of these proposals have their distinct public, and their distinct ways of helping construct a better world. Both of them take away a slice of business from the \"hard\" currencies but that is something we need to accept, lest we end up in a society where slavery is enforced by ... monetary means.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<b>\u00a0</b>\n\n", "created_at": "2012-03-06 15:00:16", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:22.185264", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 476, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [20886], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 74739, "user_id": 3622, "topic_id": 13275, "post_number": 14, "raw": "that works fine, I'll message you on riot a bit before.", "created_at": "2020-04-21 12:51:06.318925", "updated_at": "2020-04-21 12:51:06.318925", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 12, "wiki": false, "reads": 28, "score": 35.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [74738], "is_liked_by": [4934], "is_private": false}, {"id": 65494, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 11827, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Ping @zelf", "created_at": "2019-11-24 08:25:58.250008", "updated_at": "2019-11-24 08:25:58.250008", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 6.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60938, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 10637, "post_number": 21, "raw": "call at this link: https://zoom.us/j/489971765", "created_at": "2019-10-08 15:37:02.048882", "updated_at": "2019-10-08 15:37:02.048882", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 9, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 7.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 57859, "user_id": 4288, "topic_id": 10523, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Thanks @alberto.

The presentation might involve both you and @noemi (10 mins each plus discussion. I may moderate. It is not really the panel that will be instrumental but the follow-up and networking afterwards. The dates of the festival are 20 and 21 Sept. The panel is on 21 Sept. Donor meetings will hopefully be arranged for both days. If you can, stay in Berlin until 22 Sept, so that we can have a short de-brief in the morning. In free time at the festival, you might want to attend other sessions.  The first list of speakers is on the website [https://en.creativedemocracy.net which will be significantly increased over the next month (more than 100 speakers). No need for any work from you just now. Will wait for an update from UNDP, their proposed speakers, and the contract (being prepared).   There may be other ER interested in the festival. I will post general info on Campfire, but are there specific people I should ping? Can the  ER communications team assist drawing attention to ER involvement in the Berlin festival?", "created_at": "2019-08-12 13:03:43.116798", "updated_at": "2019-08-12 13:03:43.116798", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 311, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 18.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [57829], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 66681, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 11263, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2019-12-02 16:01:12.794079", "updated_at": "2019-12-02 16:01:12.794079", "deleted_at": "2019-12-02 16:08:49.624110", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10032, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 1957, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Funding answers</b>\n\nHi Francesco,\n\nI think it's great and quite honest to come forward with these questions. Indeed I've been reading your blogs about Lote and the unMonastery, and I feel\u00a0partly\u00a0responsible that this key information has not reached you yet.\n\nSo: Lote is an event where everyone is volunteering their time to build it into a great experience, which means that it depends on each and every one of us to get hold of funding opportunities. Edgeryders the organisation offers the infrastructure for organising it, as well as mobilizing members to help out, but <strong>it does not dispose of its own financial resources yet</strong>.\u00a0\n\nWe are indeed trying to come up with creative methods to try and lower some of the costs - such as <a href=\"/t/lote3/312-logistics-team/accommodation\">discounts at local B&amp;Bs </a>or at <a href=\"/t/accommodation-wiki/1816/11\">AirBnb.com</a>, opportunity to <a href=\"/t/lote3/312-logistics-team/lote3-travel-arrangements\">rideshare</a> and things like that.\u00a0<span>In terms of some fully funded places, w</span><span>e have managed to secure a <a href=\"/t/two-scholarships-for-lote3-available-for-dutch-residents/1941\">sponsorship from the Dutch Embassy in Rome</a> for Dutch residents only- 1000 EUR worth, and this was a matter of good contacts and trust i think.</span><span>\u00a0There is available documentation for people who want to reach out to their own gov embassy in Italy and do the same in trying to secure their travel... let me know if you need it.\n\nI do hope this helps, I too have heard from [Xavier] at Mutinerie and hope he and others will still be able to make it!</span>\n\n<span>Noemi\n\nPS if it helps, the way to ping people is simply put their usernames into square brackets like I'm doing with you [immaginoteca]</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-09-17 16:05:36", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:57.967081", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 369, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 48300, "user_id": 2569, "topic_id": 9006, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Hi @hazem, did you ever hear anything back about this?

Here is a summary of the call and the next actionable steps we discussed:\n\n**1. Organising the events themselves:**\n\n* Every organiser should be able to say if they or someone else take care of these 3 roles for their events. If it is yourself, please say so, if it is someone else, please list the name and role of that person in your event description and get us in contact with them so we can make sure they have everything they need :) :\n1. **Facilitator** for workshops/talks/sessions planed. (These also include activists and participants who take a more active role in your event)\n\n1. **Documentation organiser** Someone needs to be responsible for the coordination and partially conduct documentation for the event. Get them in contact with us to discuss our method for community documentation methods.\n\n1. **Contact person for questions and logistics**\n\ndepending on your event you might also need to name other roles such as:\n\n* (Reqiererement Engineer for hackathons)\n* (Matchmaking organiser for networking events)\n\nAsk yourself if you can take care of all of it, or if you need help. It will run smoother if you assign those roles. If you have a problem filling them tell us and we will try to help you find someone. Also, get the people you assign in contact with us so we can organise together more smoothly!\n\n.\n2. **Outreach:**\nWe will create a facebook event for each of the Festival events for you. IF you have questions regarding that ask @anon82932460. We also commissioned templates for flyers for social media, which you can see [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11cDhmukccGqWkSpuCNWhdF3jpGFHPFGc?usp=sharing). We will prepare those for you, just provide us with:\n\n1. A short title for your event\n\n1. A one-sentence pitch description of your event\n\n1. An image to put onto the flyer to which you have the rights, which either connects to your topic or shows you or one of your speakers/facilitators in action (in that case, please give us also their name)\n\n_send those directly to me @MariaEuler and load them up as replies to your festival thread and ping me and @anon82932460_  \n\n**We will also hire a journalist to interview all the experts and activists that are crucial to your event, their field and that we would to especially invite into the further discussion. Please provide us with the names and contact of the people coming to your event/invited to your event, which you think we should interview!**\n.\n**3. Sign Up:**\nWe set up the sign up via the minisite (https://tell.edgeryders.eu/festival_ticket). Everyone can sign up here and select the event they want to attend. We then answer them personally telling them how to activate their ticket by making a post with the organisers in cc.\n\n* Personalise the templates for the answer emails for your event:\n  * https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cjY51Qsyl_3jtabQNLOFQxLJ6wm4kH83doy6nD78NbU/edit?usp=sharing\n* Give us an email address which we can cc in the answer email of those who sign up to your event :)\n\n\n.\n**4. Budget:**\nThe Budget for For the NGI events is 12000 euro + 2500 euro for travel, for the pop rebel events there is a budget of 1000 euro per event, summing up to 3000 euro in total, which is taken from a different funding body.\n\n1. Fill in your budget in as much detail as possible here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IIk5nCMebzEFqJ3ik4pp9vR8f65Wm5GuVCyUPgQ-o-Q/edit?usp=sharing\n\n1. Remember to keep the receipts for anything you need to be reimbursed for\n\n1. If what you need to pay is via invoice, like the location or the fee for the facilitator, you can have them make it out to Edgeryders directly, so you do not have to pay upfront. Contact @marina about how to make those invoices. \n\n\n**AND most importantly: If you haven't already, finish the description of your events on the platform! @zelf, @TamaraVuk, @pbihr, @jasen_lakic.

Forgive me if that is true of Open Ethnographer and spelled out in one of the docs, I only skimmed!\n\nI am not affiliated with hypothes.is, but have followed the project for some time. They are a talented, active outfit and have also <a href=\"http://ethnographymatters.net/blog/2012/02/24/online-reputation-its-contextual/\">consulted academics of various stripes</a> to assess the utility of their offering in different fields. I would be interested to hear what their approach to ethnography is. I imagine there might be a smart extension of what they have built to allow for such embellishments, <a href=\"http://matt.microsplash.org/beyond-annotating-the-web/\">something I have thought about before</a>. By this, I mean using infrastructure like this to augment specific parts of web pages with rich, searchable, ethnographic data.\n\nIt would be a shame to duplicate effort, even partially, so perhaps there is scope for collaboration.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>2</strong> The <a href=\"/t/open-ethnographer-idea-concept-goals/3971\">article you give</a> is very thorough. I had hoped for a more terse overview which might help non-experts (e.g. casual visitors <a href=\"/en/projects\">to the site</a>) attempting to get a quick grasp on the project with e.g. a fleshed-out use case such as development of the statement:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\t<blockquote class=\"content-citation\">\n\n<div>\n\n<strong>Trend detection by wisdom of crowds.</strong><span>\u00a0By virtue of focusing on communities, ethnography is good at detecting the weak signals of social, economic and cultural trends in the making.</span>\n\n</div>\n\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is a great project though!

While the economic theory behind it might be redundant for economists and market experts, it seems that the doughnut is a tool that prompts (possibly again to no avail, if I read Alberto well) some action. \n\n[quote=\"alberto, post:19, topic:13173\"]\nWho is to meet human needs with products and services?\n[/quote]\nProbably new capitalist companies, like we see happening in food innovation. They start out meeting some needs, but they can be equally challenged - is Impossible Foods with their fake meat really providing a sustainable food? Not quite, as they are already challenged on the grounds of using GMO ingredients and other additives in their patties. So yes, if the doughnut will be implemented in a capitalist system, it's probably that it will create new winners, and same losers. But is its net effect positive? It seems like it, at least because it engages thinking differently about the problems and offers new opportunities for some communities. All communities?

In 2014, Edgeryders and Comitato Matera joined forces to build a <a href=\"/t/civic-innovation-network/368\">Civic Innovation Network</a> centered in Matera but extending globally; we have been instrumental in bringing what Matera is trying to do to various European networks (especially in the hacker/social innovation/art scenes), and in building international alliances with a view to enabling any citizen to enhance the commons. I personally had the honor to serve in the team of ten people that represented the Matera candidacy during the final interview with the adjudicating panel in Rome, just 24 hours before it made its final decision. I brought to that discussion the voice of bottom-up civic innovators and engaged citizens.\n\nBut above all, and even before we got involved with the candidacy, we had been \"cultural citizens\" of Matera.

The intention is to bring into view Matera\u2019s informal practices, unrecorded memories and hidden characteristics to create a picture of the area and highlight potential opportunities and challenges. This research will then form the backbone of an Asset Mapping Toolkit that can be used in two ways: firstly for future unMonasteries to use it as a way of understanding what strengths already exist in the community they are based in, and secondly to create a new way of seeing Matera in the hope that this can trigger new approaches and ideas for future initiatives.\n\nThe next step would be to hold a public event to present back the findings in various formats to unMonastery members and locals. The purpose of this would be to get their feedback about the results of the asset mapping in particular to find out what is missing and whether it reflects how they feel about the town. The second part would be a co-production workshop to work out how these findings could feed into the ideas and projects that are emerging through the unMonastery.\n\nLocal Challenge it addresses:\n\nAs this is an asset mapping exercise, the aim of the conversations will be to unearth a breadth of both assets and challenges that different people experience in Matera. Through this process, certain challenges that have already been identified may resurface through these conversations.\n\n\u00b7      Many houses and buildings are not in use and there is no architectural innovation.\n\n\u00b7      Lack of a global view on the city\n\n\u00b7      Significant lack of offline engagement or visibility for happenings throughout the city\n\n\u00b7      Lack of a inter-generational space\n\nHow the Project has changed:\n\n\u00b7       It is clear that there needs to be a focus on a more specific area and too much attention on the Sassi isn\u2019t desirable. The University of Basilicata are working in the area of Picianello and as there is a strong potential for collaboration with them it would seem sensible to focus on the Sassi and Picianello.\n\n\u00b7       The asset mapping toolkit has to be redefined so that it can fit with the other assets that are being mapped by various groups within and outside the unMonastery.\n\nSuccesses and Challenges:\n\nSuccesses:\n\n\u00b7       Arriving at the mid-point has meant that there are a substantial amount of contacts that I can tap into, however this has side-tracked the urgency of building relationships out from the existing network of the unMonastery and the Committato.\n\nChallenges:\n\n\u00b7       Communication barriers \u2013 we need to improve the way that we communicate about the project to everyday Materans\n\n\u00b7       Community engagement- simple strategies like talking to people on the street are currently not happening.

Personally, even though I'm no giant, I love contributing to these really new trans- or inter-disciplinary areas. I was deeply impressed, around 1975, reading \"Scientific Knowledge and Its Social Problems\" by Jerome R. Ravetz, originally from 1971. Rom Harr\u00e9 used to recommend it in his lectures in Oxford.\u00a0 It had a great chapter headed \"Immature and ineffective fields of inquiry\" (you can get some results from searching for the phrase in quotes) which set out some of the dangers, and excitements, of these areas.\n\nIt's easy to imagine this is all about giants, and maybe it used to be, but I don't think that is so any more. The world (of knowledge) has grown so vast, no one is a giant anymore. If instead we constitute ourselves as collaborative, cooperative intelligent ants, though, I think we can make progress. Ants (real ones) do so much with so little individual intelligence. What could we do, if we were to coordinate with the power of ants? This links so well across our discussions ... it is the culture of collaboration that is key, and that in turn rests on how we interact day to day -- \"micro\" level, you could say. To me, it involves deep listening to each other, just as care more generally does. It involves co-creating, and co-managing, a culture in which the commons is held in higher regard than the individual, and where the commons wisdom knows who to ask about particular issues; where we all help to redirect, rather than individualistically claiming intellectual territory for ourselves. In the network, some people are valuable more as nodes, others more as links.\n\nMy personal interest in the thread might start off by asking about the nature, the provenance and the governance of tags themselves.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-07-15 03:39:22", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:03.711338", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 318, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 2.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [33372], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 74931, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 13300, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Starting a list of  initiatives that we may want to include as case studies for the summit.

About\n\nDeliverable D2.3 was rejected, and needs to be resubmitted. This document contains our (Edgeryders) understanding of who needs to to what, and how to comply with the reviewers' instructions.\n\n\n## 2. The text of the rejection letter\n\n>The deliverable document should include several details that are not explicitly mentioned and may create problems in terms of data storage and security. In essence, the revision has to add several details for clarity: \n>\n>1. It is quite clear where the data is stored but there are no details about how secure this primary unit of storage is / how security is ensured.\n>\n> 2. How does data sharing take place between partners? \n>\n> 3. Data from interviews and participant observation are stored on OneDrive. How are the safety and security of the cloud ensured? What happens if OneDrive shuts down unexpectedly? \n>\n> 4. What is the strategy for back-up copies in case something goes wrong with the files stored in the primary unit? Data management plans must include such provisions, which are mentioned neither in the deliverable nor in the technical report.\n>\n> 5. The project uses social media data. Is consent from users required for that type of data?\n>\n> 6. How does the consortium deal with various data management requirements across different countries? Has the project considered the legislation in all countries involved in the project and do the DMP provisions meet those requirements?\n>\n> 7. The deliverable refers to the publication on the website of data from WP6 in September 2019. Since this did not happen, any references to it must be deleted.\n\n## 3. Who needs to do what? \n\n* **Question 1** needs to be addressed by *all partners*. For those of you using One Drive, see below. \n* **Question 2** needs to be addressed by partners in WP3 and WP4. For WP5, I hope that Corvinus finally selected the contractor for their survey, and then they would also need to update their part with this information. Following a suggestion by Joanna, we have added a final section to the document where we group this information by partner, rather than by WP. We are referencing this final section in the sections referring to different WPs.\n\n   > All data collected will be initially stored on secure university drives of each of the partners (most universities in the consortium use OneDrive) and then transferred to the shared drive for the entire project (POPREBEL shared folder on OneDrive). \n\n     The issue here is that data are first registered in each partner's One Drive, then moved over to the POPREBEL projects' One Drive. You need to specify that this happens under a secure protocol: at a minimum file transfer via https. If you use Advanced Encryption with One Drive (or equivalent for storage systems other than One Drive), specify so. \n\n* **Questions 3 and 4** needs to be addressed by partners in WP3 and WP4. For WP5, I hope that Corvinus finally selected the contractor for their survey, and then they would also need to update their part with this information. \n\n   The issue here is to specify the security measures taken by Microsoft for One Drive, and the backup provisions. See the resources section of this document below. Notice that backup provisions could come via third party services: according to one vendor\n\n> Yet, while Microsoft focuses on data availability, they fall short in terms of data recoverability. Simply put, **Microsoft 365 isn\u2019t a backup solution.** ([source](https://pages.solarwindsmsp.com/back-up-the-full-office-365-suite-at-an-affordable-price.html))\n\nSo, here the reviewers want to know what happens if One Drive crashes. The correct answer is \"we have daily (or hourly, whatever) backups, stored locally (or in the cloud)\". \n\n\n\n* **Question 5** is a bit unclear. The DMP has no reference to social media. However, I would like to ask the partners in WP3 to confirm that they, indeed, plan to use social media data (section 1 mentions \"online content\"). If so,  Jagellonian must address the question (see resources below). If not, we will clarify. If you are not working on social media data, you can ignore this question.\n\n* **Question 6** needs to be addressed by partners in WP3 and WP4. For WP5, I hope that Corvinus finally selected the contractor for their survey, and then they would also need to update their part with this information. \n\n   The issue here arises because data are collected in different jurisdictions (example from WP5: \"a representative survey of Hungary and/or East Central European countries\"). If this happens, the Commission wants to know that you are aware of the differences between the data protection laws of different countries, and you will adopt the most restrictive ones, or all the relevant ones. Example: in Estonia we are required to enter the name of our data protection officer into a state registry. \n\n* **Question 7** concerns U Tartu. The paragraph that needs to be changed is in section 2.1:\n\n   > Firstly, a preliminary version of the scenarios will be prepared for discussion during academic conferences and events in Autumn 2019; a second version to be prepared by January 2020 for use in seminars with policy-makers and focus groups; and a third version to be prepared by June 2020 at the end of the consultation period.\n\n## 4. Resources.\n\nFirst of all, here is a [site on the EC Horizon 2020 Requirements](http://researchdata.ox.ac.uk/funder-requirements/ec-horizon-2020/) for storing research data. \n\n**Questions 1, 2 and 3** : If data is stored primarily on One Drive, the following guidance should be helpful: \nhttps://help.it.ox.ac.uk/nexus365/onedrive-business-usage. To summarise the main points:\n1. The safety and security of One Drive is ensured in part by you, the user. By default you are the only one with access to your data on OneDrive. To ensure that safety and security, you must state that you will not share the files with anyone outside of (insert here: e.g. the POPREBEL project, or whatever is appropriate). This should also help you articulate the answer to question 2 - how are you handling permissions so that other partners can securely access the data? The answer should probably be along the lines of allowing access via OneDrive permissions, as a secure channel. \n\n As Oxford puts it: \"OneDrive is certified against the internationally recognised information security standards and approved by the University for all data. However, you are responsible for using it in a safe and secure way.\" This ONLY applies to the OneDrive version provided by Nexus365 -- other versions of OneDrive are not approved in terms of data security, at least at Oxford. \n\nAs Microsoft writes:\n * The customer maintains control of the lifecycle of customer data and user-generated content. Admins and end users can add, modify, and delete data explicitly via well-known user interfaces or admin tools. Admins can set retention policies on OneDrive/SharePoint content (on a per-user basis). Data can be removed aggressively or preserved for longer periods.\n*Account data synchronized from Office 365 is used to determine, based on licenses, what experience the end user is entitled to. This data follows the lifecycle of the user. Admins can add, modify and delete user accounts, and those changes will be promptly reflected in OneDrive for Business.\n* Product and service usage data follows a controlled lifecycle designed to comply with GDPR data subject requests.\n* Finally, with Advanced Encryption with Customer Key, administrators can be confident that when they have offboarded their data, that Microsoft no longer has any access.\n\nFurther, Microsoft also states in terms of its own data protections: \n\nWe have designed tight controls and measures, technical and organizational, to protect customer data against accidental, unauthorized or unlawful access, disclosure, alteration, loss, or destruction. Some examples include:\n\n* We restrict physical data center access to authorized personnel and have multiple layers of physical security, such as biometric readers, motion sensors, 24-hour secured access, video camera surveillance, and security breach alarms.\n*We enable encryption of data both at rest and in transit between data centers and users. End User Pseudonymous Information (EUPI) is hashed following FIPS140-2 requirements.*\n* We conduct internal privacy, compliance, security and legal review of all new commercial features, services, and processes.\n*Finally, services are independently verified to meet the applicable compliance framework set forth in our Online Services Terms (OST). This includes FedRAMP, SOC, and ISO, and [many more.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/TrustCenter/Compliance/default.aspx)\n\nMention any of the above as needed as what you will do to ensure data is not shared outside of the project or your institution. This ensures that no data is held beyond the date you declared you'd delete it, and that all copies and backups are in fact completely destroyed. \n\nOneDrive and location: OneDrive allows the user to store data in your chosen geographical location. You should check what permissions you've allowed in OneDrive in terms of location. Restrict as needed (to EU/EEA, for example). \n\n**Question 4:** Secondary backups. Researchers should always keep 2 backups. I recommend keeping one on an (encrypted, password protected) external hard drive and one in the Cloud.

It can be utilized on the Discourse side as well, by displaying the tag page with a special template similar to how [our blog on Discourse](/tags/blog?view=topic-preview) worked (currently broken due to an update). I just would not remove the tag afterwards, because it eliminates useful information and work. Rather make the website slider display the most recent *n* items tagged #news.\n\nA counterexample would be a tag like **#website-newsslider** that is always only applied to (say) five news items. Or even worse, tags with fine-grained control over the position in the slider: **#website-newsslider-pos1**, **#website-newsslider-pos2** etc.. That's rather useless and annoying for Discourse users, and does not exploit the possible synergy of news usage in both Discourse and the website. It's also more maintenance intensive, harder to understand, and would prevent community members from participating in the tagging effort.\n\nDeciding between good and bad design for selection mechanisms is a bit like in LaTeX: when the software itself is intelligent enough to select, order, layout and place things, it's a waste of time to try exerting manual control over that process. A laid-back attitude of letting (good) software do the magic while being happy with the results is more useful here. Similarly, the webkit and CMS tools in general are tools for time-efficient, rule-based organization of content. These tools *should not* provide fine grained manual control over individual bits and pieces.

Today we're talking to Pablo Velasco.  He's an assistant professor at Aarhaus University. And you have a history, at least with your PhD, on researching blockchain? \n\nPablo:\nYes. \n\nZenna:\nAnd currently, what's your focus? \n\nPablo:\nI still research blockchain to some degree because that's what I'm known for in the academic world. But I'm also interested in decentralized web in general, and automation processes in general.  Especially creative automation processes. \n\nZenna:\nYeah. So we haven't had this conversation yet in private. I look forward to having that one too about the decentralized web. But to start off, I'm really curious about what journey brought you to wanting to study blockchain. How does it begin? And was there a societal perspective to this? \n\nPablo:\nYes, that's my, my my approach always. Like, politics and social elements of technology, in this case blockchain. The first thing is that I started studying in my very early years, electrical engineering, because I really much it was very much into computers, technology and that kind of stuff. I was building my own computers. And I started that career. And then at some point, I started reading philosophy, I started reading Nietzsche, and I was still kind of young.\n\nZenna:\n Which one?\n\nPablo:\nThis was the  posthumous writings, so like a bunch of separate non order writings. And I got really engaged with that. So I left... \nZenna:\nWhat ideas got you engaged with that? \n\nPablo:\nI think it was more the type of questioning, because in electrical engineering, you will have very static ways to think about the world. Yeah, I was more pragmatic, more utilitarian. And these were questions about existence and why are we here? And what who questions are power, for example, right? So at some point that became more interesting for me to pursue to some degree. So I applied to a philosophy place in a modern University. And I got accepted. So I did, I made that jump. So technology always seemed like sub subterranean to some degree to my further background. Yeah. And then later, when I finish my master, I was still in philosophy, very metaphysics question actually. And I started using Linux, which I always I always have the tingle of it. It's been about 10 years now, since it started Linux and I was very driven by this idea kind of community enabled, instead of business capitalist kind of ideology behind it. So I was very much into it. So when I finish my master, I start looking for technology again, but always from this social perspective. So Linux was like that. The jumping port. Yeah. And then I have to select something to study there was kind of on that avenue. And I cared about Bitcoin at that moment. That was 2012-13. So it was already there, but still not on a mainstream level. And I thought, well, this is this was a great case study, right, because it's about decentralizing and making, building a system from a community. \n\nZenna:\nOkay, so you mentioned a word right there that I think is very interesting to also find out what it means to you. Because it's a word that is used a lot recently. But it has a lot of different meanings. So \"communities\" is one, I think most people have a similar sense of that one. But: decentralized. What does decentralized mean to you from a more society perspective, as you said, like technology is a little bit easier to discern what's decentralized, because the average take on what decentralized means, but societely, what does that mean for you? Is that a power question? Is that a community question? Is that a structural question? \n\nPablo:\nI think it's definitely a structural one in terms of hierarchy. Right. So political systems.  \nMost historical political systems have have been based in strong hierarchies. So yeah, I think you have a decentralization leans towards something that is distributed in a different way. But it's still it's kind of blurry, because, yes, I think it's a word that is used too much.  Like a buzzword it has currency, but it's rarely defined, in part because it's difficult. Right. And I think it's very interesting that you mentioned not technology, but social because I think a lot of projects tend to mixed those two, and you kind of are confused which one they are talking about. Right. And it happened. I mean, my research was many bitcoins during my PhD. And there was a struggle for the centralization, but most of the time, it was meant socially, whatever that meant. But it was enacted technologically. So there was a like a gap, a gap. Yeah, like, almost, I'm missing the word, but a bit of psychotic difference in between those split. Yes. So what I will say is that you don't necessarily have to look on technological advancements to think about some sort of decentralized structures, right?\n \nA lot of communities and working environments not a lot, a few, a few exist. They exist. And they don't necessarily need a technological medium to exist. Right. \n\nZenna:\nAnd you mentioned that to me like co ops. Yes. Or community run daycare. \n\nPablo:\nSo yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah. I think the co-op is the great example. Where systems of power are some degree decentralized. Right. In in more specific political examples, the Zapatistas in Mexico is not decentralized, per se, still like a representational system to some degree, but it makes a lot, it puts a lot of emphasis on having discussions from the grass roots and finding consensus from the grassroots before, instead of, someone deciding. \n\nZenna:\nit's where the masses of power are located in a society, yeah, yeah. community or in a some cases technology. Yes, yes. And that's a very interesting thing that you mentioned that, because I've felt that a lot myself actually where it's been a difficult path to maneuver between the decentralized webs and the blockchain cryptocurrency world, because they'll both use the same terminology of decentralization. I think I've seen recently that \"distributed systems\" is a term that's used often and like the decentralized distributed realms more maybe to differentiate from the only technological aspect that goes with the decentralized. I don't know, but it was a really interesting thought that I'd never put down so concretely before in my own head. Yeah. So thank you.\n\nPablo:  \nIf I could say a bit more about that. Another thing that I think we're putting in the table is that - and I carry these from a guy a researcher called David Colombia, Columbia a few years ago in a conference - is that there's like an assumption that decentralization is good and better and an improvement. And I believe most of the times it is, but he questioned that.  He was like, Yes, but why? Why are we assuming that that's that's an improvement? Right? So I don't have an answer for that actually. But I think it's important to ask not only how do we decentralize things, but also like, why are we Why should we decentralized certain things aren't and maybe not not everything right. \n\nZenna:\nAnd it's a highly politically subjective perspective probably too. I'd imagine that most people who also promote decentralization also promote the more liberal I guess it's called, of the political compass style. \n\nPablo:\nYes, the more libertarian approach, they will say that, that will also be very much in favor of a kind of decentralization that is not the same as the co-op, right? Not exactly. And in in that sense. There are cool projects like the <UNKNOWN> and I researcher that gathers modern cooperative projects. And he calls like platform corporative activism. \n\nZenna:\nCool. \n\nPablo:\nSo it's like, but the emphasis on deck operatives and how technology helps them, but not the other way around. Right? Yeah. \n\nZenna:\nCool. I'm going to ask you about that afterwards. So, I wanted to bring this back, though, because you mentioned that you found blockchain during 2012. And you started your PhD writing about it. And before we started this conversation, you gave me a tidbit, which was also the term \"utopia\", which you mention has been played a big role for you and your writings. Specifically, you mentioned the differences between utopias. Does this is also tie into decentralization?  Are they weaved together? \n\nPablo:\nI think they are, at least in their ambiguity. Yeah.  I mean, I haven't worked very publicly on the concept we talking about, but that was a narrative argument that was in my PhD dissertation for sure. Part of the narrative it was it was like, and it was applied to each of the different meanings of utopia, One is: Why does there no place in the says that a non physical place or non existing place, right, so a lot of that is about cyberspace, the, the inner we inherited from the 90s. And that kind of stayed still there. That cyberspace is in office. Yes, exactly. So yeah, and not even physical, but like a no-space. Let's call it like that. Yeah, there's that tinge of utopia that comes from from from before.\n\nThere is also the the idea of a place that is to be achieved. So something that has to come to be yet. And that that's what I think decentralization is really tied to it because it's also like something will happen. And when it happens, things are gonna be different. And we cannot know and if it's utopia, it'll be different in a good way. Yes. There is also the utopia that is not meant to be reachable, right? There no place that the moment you reach it is no longer the no-place. Right? It's it becomes the place. I know. It's it's a bit cryptic, to some degree, but utopia is also something that it's always in the idea and remains in the idea. \n\nZenna:\nAnd I think it can't really exist in reality, because reality is never utopia. \n\nPablo:\nYeah, yeah. And that's kind of the the use of of it. Not something like negative right is the use of it. \n\nZenna:\nAnd these three levels is something to aim for. \n\nPablo:\nYes, exactly. Yeah. And I think there's three levels of different kinds of utopia. You see them in, in different ways in in, in decentralization-driven projects, right. That's the way I use it, at least in my in my work.\n\nZenna:\nThat ties very well into the narratives that are happening with the solar punk movement as well. \n\nPablo:\nYeah. But I think it's important to separate which one is which, right, which one is it's it works as an ideology in a good sense. And which one is more elusive and more...\n\nZenna:\nBeautifying. \n\nPablo:\nBeautifying? \n\nZenna:\nYeah, like creating a utopia, image - a utopian image in the sense that in \"1984\" They used a Peace Institute instead of War. Yeah. It's like beautifying the world or utopia-fying. Yeah, that's fascinating. And then that also becomes a question of, is it subjective or not.\n\nPablo:\nOof! You ask me questions like that, and yes my background is philosophy...\nbut I will say that part part of the... subjective is maybe an important word here because it kind of separates..It is not individual. Like subjective is not necessarily individual, right, which is the kind of more Silicon Valley I will say,<UNKNOWN> oriented idea, individuals that are mediated by technology and that's a good thing in itself. And I think this, the other kind of more complex idea for a subject is a subject that is not an individual. It's a subject in a community, for example, that is made a subject because it's in a community and there's where you have the co-op more linked. \n\nSo when you ask me if it's subjective, I immediately think of which kind of subject. \n\nZenna:\nIs it a community subject or is it an individual subject. While we were talking about communities and Silicon Valley, it brought me into something I'm just curious to ask you and see your take on because I've been pondering it in my own head and I have not come to a conclusion yet. The topic is DAOs: decentralized autonomous organizations. And from my perspective, it's been curious because I've heard a lot of people mention DAOs that was of course, and, and tokenization of organizations in order for automating them, and with the subject in this case would be for the community or for the individual to speak. That's my own thought pattern around DAOs. Yes. Have you been thinking about DAOs? Is that like, as a part of your realm and studying blockchain? \n\nPablo:\nI mean, it is there of course because it's it's a topic that...It's around. I haven't written or thought specifically about that. But I think because in great part I related it with the DAO kind of attempt and failure from from a few years ago, right.\n\nBut I think tokenization it's a topic that is closer to where I have been thinking. And one of my issues actually, with about blockchain projects, is that they tokenize. I mean, a lot of the early blockchain designs, they were based on tokenization. Right on a production of units. That was similar to production of economic unit before it. So token: I think part of the the issue well, I don't know if it's an issue, but part of what I see as a problem is that tokens are related to economic units, like small units of value, that kind of organize the relationship. Right? And in that sense, it lands too close to the economical systems that we already have. Right. So for me, the idea of the token is very tied to pre existing economies that the quality is that getting rid of those economies right, going beyond those. On the other hand, it's not like I know exactly what will be a good replacement or attempt. \n\nZenna:\nSpeaking of good replacement seminars, are there any projects that you've encountered on your journey that you've been like, wow, they're kind of on to something. You know what I mean? \n\nPablo:\nYes, but I guess I have to say that not that many.\n\nZenna:  \nIs it that you have high standards?  \nmaybe to broaden your radius?\n\nPablo:  \nI think my problem was, I mean, it was very invested in the early years, like 2012 to 2016 or 17, and my main problem was that most of the projects will have a very, very verbose way of presenting the project and then they will be a replication of other systems, right. Like a lot of alternative currencies, which are not a trendy thing to say now, now you say decentralized apps, but but the way they work is not that different. So it's just like a new... \n\nZenna:\nt's a lot of tag words. cuz they use the technology. Yeah, blockchain technology. Yeah, this system is the same. \n\nPablo:\nYeah, exactly. And most of them will phrase their projects in in radically different ways. And then you will see that the working it was exactly the same right as as other crypto. So I guess it's hard to we can be very blinded by the amount of projects, if you could see the list of decentralized apps are there. They're massive, right? But, but when you go beyond that and start to see like, well, what's a specific difference and of this one, you see that there, you can cluster them in relatively easy, you can also check, like which degree of development they had, most don't have that much development. So from the massive amount of projects that you can see, it's easy to decimate that number. And then... \n\nZenna:\nbecause of the similarities\n\nPablo:\nI will say that it's less that the centralized projects but I have found interesting and more the, the loops that go back to the cooperative, and then the technology they use is like the secondary thing, right. And in that sense, I mean, the decent project was was an interesting one that eventually was kind of implemented to some degree, at least in Barcelona or some other communities, that it started like that, right, like, like, it was part of it was like a cryptocurrency at some point. And but it ended up being to some degree, successfully implemented for a different way to relate related to government. But then again, it was because I think tech was a bit secondary. And the main point was like, how do we reorganize this between people for people? Yeah. So and that kind of those kind of projects is the ones that you don't see that often. Many because it, there's, they're small, right? And they don't have like venture capital or big websites or anything like that. So that's why this idea of platform corporate activism listing is interesting because you see that it's, it may be a really small project in a small community, in Ireland, or in your country. And for me, that's the really interesting part. \n\nZenna:\nSo when we go into the fact that there's a lot of smaller projects out there in the realms of more social action. Yeah. And then secondary technology. We have the case in a lot of the mainstream, more default internet, as we know it, that there's also a lot of misinformation going around. Do you think that there could be a point in also having these smaller initiatives of technology? \nOr do you see that there's a risk in the smaller initiatives existing and then not learning from each other because they're too small? Or in the in the space of worldwide webs? Yeah. to local smaller initiatives?\nHow do you fare?\n\nPablo:  \nI think I'm more driven to local networks even if they are disconnected between each other in great part because there is different ways and things to solve in regions, right? So kind of having like a magical solution or technology solution or something our organization solution for a really broad spectrum of people. I think that's really complicated, probably destined to not work because of the differences in localism. Right and coming back to Zapatistas in Mexico. Part of their speech is that attempting to replicate them in other countries and other contexts is like, that's absurd, right? \n\nZenna:\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, did they not train in the forest? And secret for like, 10 years or something? Yeah, it was like that. \n\nPablo:Yeah, it was about 10. He was kind of small guerillas. I mean, it has a very interesting history. So they came out in 94. But since the 80s or so. But yeah, the it's a really long project, right? It's a very interesting project, but the it has 30-40 years in the working and, and it's local. I mean, it's it's about a certain region in certain communities in Mexico, and for that they made it work in a beautiful and very utopian way.\n\nBut then again, if you just take like that risk recipe, and try to apply it in, in Denmark or whichever region, it's, it's probably not gonna work, of course, because it's important to take care of the context. And that's why local communities and local networks even, cannot communicate between each other. For me that's kind of quite relevant. \n\nZenna:\nEspecially in today's globalized world. Yeah, getting resources from all over the planet and shipping it all over the planet. Yeah, that's something huge amounts of co2 all over the planet. It feels like also finding local solutions could be a good key. \n\nYeah. So we're going to wrap this up on this lovely note of globalization and Zapatistas. Thank you for a wonderful conversation. Thank you. And yeah, any last notes you want to throw in there?\n\nPablo:  \nNo, I'm just glad that these kind of channels exist. And that we keep asking questions about these topics like not just answering right now just trying to offer solutions. \n\nZenna:\nThere's also like, many questions to keep asking before coming with a concrete pre-packaged \"Buy Now 99%.\"\n\nWell, yes. So keep asking questions. And if you want to ask Pablo questions, cuz it will actually be available to answer questions on the Edgeryders platform. Yeah. That's it for us. Thank you so much. \n\nPablo:\nThank you Zenna, a pleasure to be here.", "created_at": "2020-01-08 11:40:40.677668", "updated_at": "2020-12-09 19:17:05.656173", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 3735, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 112.4, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [60852], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 4022, 4934, 5040], "is_private": false}, {"id": 68253, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 11974, "post_number": 88, "raw": "Great to hear that!

The rubber gaskets and valves are the thing that ages / may need some cleaning, the rest of the pot usually is good for ages.[/quote]\n\nDamaged rubber gaskets and valves in European style pressure cookers are exactly why I love the elliptic-lid Indian style pressure cookers. There, the gasket is just a large O-ring, pressurized from the steam pressure between lid and pot because the lid is *inside* the pot when cooking. Also the valve is a simple weight on a pipe \u2013 nothing to be damaged there.\n\nI have looked around for the \"perfect\" Indian style pressure cooker for myself, and came up with the [Hawkins Futura FP40](https://www.hawkinscookers.com/WebPCMain.aspx?cat=FHA) (or IFP40 for induction). The special property is that it can also be used for (light) frying at the start, so one pot less to use for recipes when I cook in the truck :) It's the only Indian style pressure cooker that I know of that can also do frying. Also it's a nice modern model, without bare aluminium.

The inside of the domes \"is super nice \u2026 much surprised\" (@unknown_author). Consists of:\n\n* main house with the big living room and a view on the sea\n* the two geodesic domes (sleeps 2-4 people each)\n* fisherman's cabin (sleeps 2 people)\n* a berber tent (sleeps 2-3 people)\n* a hamam (hot tub; the white house in the pictures)\n\nSuitable for organizing the festival in the place and the attached garden.\n\n**Condition.** Seems to be quite new. Their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/lesdomesdeOuassen/) only started in August 2017.\n\n**Equipment.** Fully furnished. The whole location uses dry toilets (means probably composting toilets with urine separation) and they recover the waste water from the shower, so only natural detergents are allowed, which are also available on-site.

I will install the [Kimai v2](https://www.kimai.org/) open-source time tracking software for teams on our server. (A [demo](https://www.kimai.org/demo/) is available.)\n\n2. People will enter their worktimes there, starting in a few days.\n\n3. **Approval process v1:** At the end of each month, collaborators get an e-mail reminding them to finish entering their worktimes. A few days later, an Edgeryders admin person exports the timesheets to PDF (with custom elements I will add to Kimai v2 to conform to EC requirements) and then use [digisigner.com](https://digisigner.com/) to let each timesheet be signed by the collaborator and their team leader. For that we'll get a single [DigiSigner Pro account](https://www.digisigner.com/pricing/) (15 USD/month, paid monthly). It includes an \"auditable log\" for signatures, and no way to change documents once in the signing process. The disadvantage is that, as long as this process is active, we have to take over the numbers from the signed timesheets into the reporting templates manually.\n\n4. **Approval process v2:** I will contract a PHP developer in Nepal (whom I know) to create a few extensions of [Kimai v2](https://www.kimai.org/demo/), in the form of plugins called \"[Symfony bundles](https://github.com/kevinpapst/kimai2/tree/master/var/docs/developers.md)\". That may take 2-4 months. After that, the following process becomes possible:\n\n    * Users can change their timesheet entries at any time (like now), but for approved entries will be warned that the entry has to be approved again.\n\n    * However when timesheet entries are marked as \"cleared\" (usually used for billed / exported), they could no longer be edited. We'd use that to mark entries that have been reported to EC.\n\n    * Team leaders can approve timesheet entries, but only those of their team members.\n\n    * We'd extend Kimai v2 to have an auditable log. This became as simple as [purchasing the audit-trail plugin now](https://www.kimai.org/store/audit-trail-bundle.html), but see also [this issue](https://github.com/kevinpapst/kimai2/issues/224)). Now, according to the EC requirements, all actions by all users that affect timesheet entries and their approval would be written to a log file. And (optionally, by implementing it ourselves) we could have a mechanism to prove that nobody modified that log, using an [eternal logfile](http://altlasten.lutz.donnerhacke.de/mitarb/lutz/logfile/idee.html) and publishing hashes of that logfile as a kind of immutable public record, for example into some kind of public blockchain, or simpler and better, by requesting archive.org to take a new snapshot of the webpage with these hashes, every month.\n\n    * The small Python based utility proposed above will talk to Kimai v2 by API, fetch approved timesheet entries, aggregate them, and fill the reporting templates accordingly.\n\n    * For a proper and flexible local time tracking software, we might optionally also adapt tom-ui, the cross-platform time tracker my brother is building for own usage. Kimai v2 has an API, so interfacing to that would be quite simple.\n\nThere are no good alternatives:\n\n* [EMDESK](http://www.emdesk.com/) is a whole software package specialized on H2020 projects, and [does not include time tracking](http://www.emdesk.com/help/starting-implementation-phase/reporting-implementation/recording-resources).\n\n* There are several SaaS time tracking applications that can provide audit logs \u2013 I found [Clockshark](https://www.clockshark.com/), [Kissflow](https://kissflow.com/), [Avaza](https://www.avaza.com/) and [Clicktime](https://www.clicktime.com/). But they are all too expensive for the functions they provide \u00ad\u2013 more expensive than all of our server hosting, in fact. Instead of paying that rent for nothing, we better invest the same money to create an open source alternative.\n\n* There is Kamai v1, but [it is said](https://www.kimai.org/blog/2018/kimai-v2-announcement/) to be 10 years old, hard to maintain PHP software, and does not include any audit log.\n\n* There is [Anuko](https://www.anuko.com/), the second team-capable open source timetracker that I know. And there is a current [initiative for a timesheet approval feature](https://www.anuko.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2008). However, Anuko is also at least 10 years old PHP software, does not really offer plugins, and while it does its job has a rather old feel to it. We are better off extending Kamai v2, even though right now it's a pre-release software with some bugs left.

Some quick thoughts about this: multi-level marketing seems (to me) profiteering from existing social relations, so it's rather exploitative. The other models are different, as in one way or another they are about socializing the profits of collective action. Either by all-out socialism (Kibbutz) or by limited socialism that affects one area of life only (purchaser coops, employee-owned companies). The secret sauce is in all cases a mechanism how the efficiency and synergy benefits of collective action are distributed to all participants rather than captured by a few capitalists or \"investors\".\n\nBut if these approaches are so beneficial for the members, there have to be reasons why they are not more widespread? I see these main issues:\n\n1. **Required scale.** To operate a self-supply economy as in a Kibbutz, or a profitable competitive company as in a worker-owned business, it needs a certain initial scale. And starting a community economy at that scale is a challenge.\n\n2. **Rigid distribution mechanisms.** Socializing the profits is all nice and fine but depending on the mechanism used to do so it can also squelch individual initiative as there is no direct benefit to such initiative. That's what makes certain flavours of socialism so unattractive to entrepreneurial spirits.\n\n3. **Globalized competition.** Some of these models, in particular worker-owned businesses, have the issue that they can only survive in a globalized competitive economy by taking part in that all-out competition. This has implications for the required scale (see above) and also means that not all the economic potential of a community can be realized because in a pure monetary economy, everyone will on average still (have to) prefer to purchase the same good at the cheaper price, whether that is from China or from a local workshop in the community.\n\nAnother model to enable community economics would be community currencies and similar schemes (time banks etc.). They have their own issues though, in that the required collective trust in the system limits the system size to Dunbar's number (\"I'll only trust this currency if I know that my trade partners are trustable.\").\n\nAfter thinking a lot about this problem, we came up with a system that (I think) addresses all of these shortcomings. After six years of development, it's available as [PayCoupons](https://pay.coupons/) now. It creates a community economy sheltered from globalized competition by resolving conditional promises of the form \"I'll do business with you if you do business with me, directly or indirectly\". Resolving this happens automatically with an algorithm we call network bartering. (See also background articles [on our blog](https://blog.pay.coupons/).)\n\nThe irony of the story is how it comes full circle now: without external funding, we'd need an _existing_ community economy as support for testing and deploying such a tool \u2026 . Anyway, the tool is there now and fully functional, and we'd welcome any group or project that is able to utilize it in their local community :slight_smile:", "created_at": "2019-08-10 13:55:46.983206", "updated_at": "2019-08-10 13:55:46.983206", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 514, "wiki": false, "reads": 20, "score": 39.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [57811], "is_liked_by": [3293], "is_private": false}, {"id": 76658, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 13475, "post_number": 10, "raw": "I like it..", "created_at": "2020-05-15 13:35:08.218207", "updated_at": "2020-05-15 13:35:08.218207", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 3, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [76622], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 51949, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 9649, "post_number": 7, "raw": "So much for the \"church/state wall\" that is supposed to exist in news orgs.", "created_at": "2019-03-21 16:04:51.870170", "updated_at": "2019-03-21 16:04:51.870170", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 15, "wiki": false, "reads": 24, "score": 69.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [51946], "is_liked_by": [5, 3704], "is_private": false}, {"id": 67075, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 10185, "post_number": 15, "raw": "i will register and see if we get lucky, then decide what to do. but let me know what else do you find, and I will keep my eye on calls - we might go do something there after al, maybe :)", "created_at": "2019-12-06 13:26:57.313840", "updated_at": "2019-12-06 13:26:57.313840", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 40, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 6.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [66985], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 76577, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 13548, "post_number": 1, "raw": "![image|494x303](upload://bqxhaLRFq7S07fRiQsHW9IplzGX.png) \n\nping @matthias... sorry to bother you man", "created_at": "2020-05-14 12:26:19.803166", "updated_at": "2020-05-14 12:26:19.803166", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 12, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 12.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 83969, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 14488, "post_number": 6, "raw": "here is the tell form:\nhttps://tell.edgeryders.eu/14495", "created_at": "2020-09-30 10:10:44.817878", "updated_at": "2020-09-30 10:10:44.817878", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 10, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 1.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [83947], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1590, "user_id": 383, "topic_id": 1557, "post_number": 1, "raw": "**Needs:** every kind of professional challanges about web and social development (create/update a web site, mobile app)\n\n**Offer:** i can done up to 4h every week of every web projects\n\n**Homes:** Riese Pio X - Treviso - Italy\n\n**Events:** i'll tell you\n\n**Projects:** Live with my family, Develop Los Massadores Mobile App, Work hard every day and every night", "created_at": "2012-06-02 20:40:59", "updated_at": "2017-09-20 14:29:28.056894", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 59, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 32.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 63260, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 11395, "post_number": 3, "raw": "yes i remember, will do this this afternoon,", "created_at": "2019-11-07 08:48:22.595546", "updated_at": "2019-11-07 09:15:45.849290", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 8, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 27.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [63259], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 67074, "user_id": 6084, "topic_id": 12130, "post_number": 1, "raw": "V \u010cesk\u00e9 republice m\u00e1me men\u0161\u00ed probl\u00e9m.

As you see, each subtitle is really short, maybe 5-12 words. [Bergamo-Hub], I have already translated the first minute or so of video, but if you don't like my translation feel free to change it.

We will be six developers (@hugi, @gustavlrsn, @liam, @questioneer, @owen and @Lazzlo), one facilitator visionary (@brooks) , one artist/designer trickster (@jakobskote) and one PhD in network science and Edgeryder extraordinaire (@alberto). We will be hosted by @Yosser and for the first two days we will be joined by up to seven additional bright and eager local web developers. Furthermore, the great @erikfrisk might be popping in remotely from time to time and we might also get to work with the spectacular @lowlandjuju and @hspeijer. \n\nTo harness this power, we need direction. That's my job, with your help and support, and @brooks above all is helping me keep that direction. As those of you who were around for the first Realities hackathon know, my particular style of setting direction often start with detailed outlines. You also know that these outlines can and should be questioned. Please do so.\n\nBased on feedback, testing and some thinking over the last few months, I've come up with a list of improvements that I think we should focus on for our next release. In the spirit of popular open source projects, each release has a code name on a theme, and what is a better theme than Borderland camps? Our first release will be called **[re]connect**, named after a camp at the Borderland with a particularly good vibe to it. And this project is all about connecting the dots, after all.\n\nSo here it is, the direction. Please point out any errors of judgement now. In the coming days I will try to form teams around a bundle of tasks in a way that makes sense. \n\nWe won't necessarily get all this done in Tunisia. Things that still need to be finished can be worked on in December by those who started the work. We have a bit of budget allocated for freelance hours for those who have done significant work already and know the codebase well.\n\n# Realities 0.1 \u2013 [re]connect\n### Target release date January 2019\n\n## Task summary\n\n### Technical core improvements\n\n- [ ] Realtime data update client side\n\n### Authorization\n\n- [ ] Only allow deletion of Need without Responsibilities\n\n- [ ] Authorize actions\n\n### New features\n\n- [ ] Multiple deliberation threads\n\n- [ ] Send email notifications\n\n- [ ] Reassign Responsibility to other Need\n\n- [ ] Show user subgraph in profile\n\n- [ ] Search for people, go to their profile\n\n### UX/UI improvements\n\n- [ ] Guided formatting of Need and Responsibility descriptions\n\n- [ ] Icons on cards and titles to indicate if realizer vacancy\n\n- [ ] New entry auto focus on text area\n\n### Integrations \n\n- [ ] Implement Ruby on Rails GraphQL API endpoint in Dreams\n\n- [ ] Realities connection to Dreams GraphQL API\n\n- [ ] Realities connection to Loomio (Talk) API\n\n## Implementation details\n\n### Technical core improvements\n\n#### Realtime data update client side\nWhen changes are made or Nodes or Responsibilities are added remotely, this must trigger a real time update in the client.\n\n### Authorization\n\n#### Only allow deletion of Need without Responsibilities\nOnly Needs without linked responsibilities should be deletable. A friendly message explaining this would be nice to have too.\n\n#### Authorize user actions\n\n- Authorize: Invite user to take over as Guide\n  - Authorized for action:\n    - Reality guide for Need or Responsibility\n\n- Authorize: Invite user to become Realizer\n  - Authorized for action:\n    - Reality guide for Need or Responsibility\n    - Realizer for Need or Responsibility\n\n- Authorize: Delete node authorization\n  - Authorized for action:\n    - Reality guide for Need or Responsibility\n    - Realizer for Need or Responsibility\n    - Only Need without connected Responsibilities can be deleted\n\n- Authorize: Add and remove dependency authorization\n  - Authorized for action:\n    - Reality guide for outgoing Need or Responsibility\n    - Realizer for outgoing Need or Responsibility\n\n- Authorize: Reassign Responsibility to other Need\n  - Authorized for action:\n    - Reality guide for Responsibility\n    - Realizer for Responsibility\n\n### New features\n\n#### Multiple deliberation threads\n\nCurrently, only a single link to a deliberation thread is allowed per Need or Reality. This is not very useful, since most Needs and Realities will be complicated enough that multiple threads are needed. Instead, we want to be able to define:\n\n- A group on Loomio/Talk where deliberation usually happens for this thing.\n- Any number of threads on Loomio/Talk where discussion on this thing is happening.\n\nInstead of the deliberation link being a property on the Need or Responsibility Node, it will now become its own (Info) node with a HAS_DELIBERATION relationship to any number of Needs or Responsibilities. Essentially, the thread is information, and the deliberation is defined by the relationship to the node.\n\nTo make it clear if there are active discussions ongoing, it should be possible to set the status of a deliberation. To begin with we will have four statuses \u2013 Active, Closed, Inactive and Active Conflict. These are set manually. This status is held as a property by the HAS_DELIBERATION relationship.\n\nIf a Loomio/Talk group is added, this is automatically sensed and instead of a HAS_DELIBERATION relation, a HAS_DELIBERATION_GROUP relation is created. Groups and threads are distinguished by colour and styling in the UI.\n\nIf a Need has a deliberation group, any Responsibility fulfilling that Need automatically gets a HAS_DELIBERATION_GROUP  relation to the same (Info) node.\n\n#### Send email notification\n\nUsers need to be notified of changes to things they care about via email. We will send notification in the following cases:\n\n- When user has been assigned to a role\n- When description or title changes\n  - If user is guide or realizer\n- When deliberation thread is added or removed\n  - If user is guide or realizer\n  - If user is guide or realizer for dependent node\n  - If user is guide or realizer of Responsibility or Need\n- When dependency created to what user is guide or realizer for\n\n#### Reassign Responsibility to other Need\nA Guide or Realiser can change which Need a Responsibility fulfils.\n\n#### Show user subgraph in profile\nUser profile should show subgraph of current user and a list of Needs and Responsibilities that user is related to. \n\n#### Search for people and go to their profile\nSearching for a user should be possible, and clicking on the user should take you to their profile and show you their subgraph. \n\n### UX/UI improvements\n\n#### Guided formatting of Need and Responsibility descriptions\nA Need is always written (We need to ... so that ... ) and a Responsibility always starts with the Need description, so that  \"We need to ... so that ... To do that ...\". This should be guided or enforced in the UX/UI, either by pre-filling text or assisting somehow.\n\n#### Icons on cards and titles to indicate vacancy\nUsers should be able to see if a Need or Responsibility has a Guide and Realizer assigned without opening the card.\n\n### Integrations\n\n#### Realities connection to Loomio (Talk) API\nLoomio has an API that is very easy to access and which can give all publicly available data in JSON format. We can periodically query Loomio for all publicly available groups and threads, to create Info nodes which we can then add create HAS_DELIBERATION and HAS_DELIBERATION_GROUP relations to.\n\n#### Implement Ruby on Rails GraphQL API endpoint in Dreams\nEventually we want to show information from Realities on Dreams in order to get more people at the Borderland to understand the nuts and bolts that go into creating the conditions for their dreams to come true, and for the to become active participants in those processes. We also want to import all Dreams into the Realities database (but usually not show them) so that each Dream can have it's own subgraph, and can define what Needs it has and which Responsibilities it depends on.\n\nRuby on Rails has a very good GraphQL endpoint package, used and maintained by GitHub, Shopify and Kickstarter. By implementing this in Dreams, we make it really easy for Dreams and Realities to talk to one another.\n\n#### Realities connection to Dreams GraphQL API\nOnce we have a GraphQL connection to Dreams, we can periodically query Dreams for all public Dreams, Grants and Users and store this data in the Realities database for future development and experimentation.", "created_at": "2018-11-06 03:02:27.070474", "updated_at": "2018-11-11 14:35:52.020172", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1311, "wiki": false, "reads": 26, "score": 355.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3622], "is_private": false}, {"id": 87474, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 14479, "post_number": 22, "raw": "Will do by Friday this week", "created_at": "2020-11-24 07:27:24.541140", "updated_at": "2020-11-24 07:27:24.541140", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 6, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 6.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [87424], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 42068, "user_id": 3704, "topic_id": 8131, "post_number": 15, "raw": "ack, just saw this!

It's in the community's best interest to be part of an interesting and deep conversation, which means it's in our duty to learn or be intuitive about how to tap into some content and actually induce the participants to develop ideas further, as well as diminish the noise by not trying to squeeze aggressively the same kind of value from i.e. those who are not so available or simply don't have it at a moment and place in time (very circumstantial.. but that's what it is).  \nI would sum it up as having a very human approach to community management, far from it being potentially automatized or reduced to 5-steps-and-you're-done in the near future.\n\nFor what it's worth about the two very intertwined roles of comm managers and ethnographers and how we are approaching collective intelligence, I'm with you on this Amelia.

Connceted to what you said above I believe that we don't necessarily need an a economic and political union/confederation to be able to meet and share ideas, thoughts, impressions.\n\nObviously, the freedom of movement/travel is an important attribute not only of the EU, but of the human beings in general. The concept of \"border\" has been manipulated to fit somebody's idea on who's entitled to this right and who's not.\n\nMy personal opinion o this topic might seem to extrme or childish for some people. I support the idea that all borders between states should be abolished. The people should be granted the freedom of movement without restriction following their spirit of the 'pursuit of happiness'.\n\nIt is pretty astonishing and sometimes painful to watch how ideas of identity and freedom of the people living outside the EU are distorted/skewed in order fall in line with the principles and regulations of political and economic entities like the EU.\n\nObviously, issues of identity are very flexible, organic processes and they should change, but I'm not sure about the possible consequences of these changes.\n\nIn fact, the reason we are meeting is to come up with better and more innovative, citizen centered policies instead of European and EU officials to be able to face these kind of changes and challenges we are currently facing.\n\nJust like democracy, the IDEA of the EU is brilliant! The point is how we operationalize it, how do we make it funtional, fair, inclusive, peaceful, etc.\n\nNow I'm anxious to meet you as well :D\n\n<a href=\"http://www.whereeuropeends.eu/\">Here's</a> a movie you might enjoy.

I spent an entire week trying to think of all possible ways how anyone can organize themselves for progress and all I could think of was how in school our teachers focused on discipline as the <em>only</em> (their word, not mine) legitimate route to progress for any student. For some reasons then I wasn\u2019t quite convinced that discipline could make for an argument here. Then I read a few of the articles on the site regarding this very idea. Most entries focused on the recent earthquake, youth and children empowerment and unity and yes, these are integral topics when it comes to progress in Nepal as Nepal is a developing nation and many examples around the world point to the importance of youth empowerment and unity in times of highs and lows for a all-round development of a country.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe posts were hugely motivational for me to create my own and so I decided to list down major ways how we can organize ourselves for progress in Nepal.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe first point on my list is Motivation. Nothing moves people like a good motivation. Take the April 25 earthquake for an example. The tremors shook the living daylights out of people but many whole-heartedly took part in the relief and rescue missions. I personally was connected to a project by the Interact District Council which aimed to distribute relief materials in Sindhupalchowk and many other affected areas despite the then on-going tremors. We were a group of young Interactors and Rotaractors and we went to build shelters for the affected families. People were homeless and helpless and we felt it was our duty to go and help them in any way we could. And that\u2019s what we did. There was no self-interest involved but the feeling of imparting goodness, which was in itself a moving motivation that pushed us.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTo be honest, that\u2019s a simple example which I am sure you will find common among many other stories. But the story wasn\u2019t my point. If motivation resulted in us leaving our homes and families for I don\u2019t know how many days or weeks and going to places where the earthquake hit the hardest (and was still hitting), imagine what it can do to a country.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMany complain today that there is no room for improvement in our country because there is no room at all to begin with. We blame our leaders and call their names and resort to social media to voice our criticism against them behind clever usernames. Among them we can find many stories that used the lacklustre performance of our government and leaders as a motivation and used it to contribute in whatever ways they can for the progress of Nepal. There are self-made entrepreneurs and youth leaders and icons and they are all doing what they can. So motivation: check!\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMotivation\u201d then brought me back to what I said about my teachers in the beginning of this article: Discipline. There can hardly be a fruitful organization without discipline, without the willpower to contain oneself in a distraction-free environment with eyes on the prize. Discipline is what keeps people in order and doesn\u2019t allow them to falter in their goals. Discipline and order (with proper motivation) turned our country from a kingdom to republic: lack of which among our leaders then led to the countless postponing of the release of our constitution. So discipline too: check!\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe other important factor for organising ourselves for progress I believe is Inclusion. Leaving out a single citizen in the grand scheme of development would mean excluding voices, and that would not result in a holistic advancement of a country. For a country to progress, one must take into account every single idea, voice and concern of every single citizen. Otherwise the progress won\u2019t be a progress but bias and it would fail to recognize the very existence of those who weren\u2019t heard.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn the end, all I want to say is that coming up with ideas for progress isn\u2019t as tough as organising the path to achieve it. And I believe that motivation, discipline and inclusion can help us organise ourselves for progress in Nepal. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-19 13:49:36", "updated_at": "2017-09-10 19:49:40.061849", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 760, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 25.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2551, 2869], "is_private": false}, {"id": 47779, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 8921, "post_number": 9, "raw": "I'm game, but I can only do (conditionally to calendar) 9-10.

Can such a step be taken maintaining the concept's initial integrity while at the same time preserving the interests of the community? And, is it at all possible to convert cultural value into a market value?</strong></em>\n\nI would be happy to get comments and contributions from everyone who has an interest in these topics, too. A possible next step would be a concise evaluation of the 12 workshops, preferably with a group of people who have a profound expertise in community management.

They, like many of us, want to do something - but don't know what they can contribute, where they can do it or even how to begin to find their way. \n\nWhether you don\u2019t know what to do about climate change or ecological breakdown (where to start, or how to contribute to reversing it) or you\u2019ve hit the \u201cglass ceiling\u201d of activism (being burned out or feeling like you\u2019re not moving forward), your thoughts and ideas collectively, will actually help find a suitable set of actions.\n\nHere\u2019s how we\u2019ll do it:\n\n* Create a holistic overview of what people within our extended networks are doing \n* See what gaps need to be worked on\n* Make a map of different paths that individuals can take from where they are (geography, skills, interests, etc) to where they can make a meaningful contribution.\n\nThese are the next steps:\n\n1. Collective enquiry: Get a number of people who are working on something related to environmental problems to share what they are doing and their experiences so far. Community managers and community members ask questions to get a deeper understanding of what each person needs and what they can offer.\n2. Collaborative analysis: We use the edgeryders method and stack of open source software for processing large numbers of smaller conversations and connecting the dots across them so we get a bigger picture, and can see clusters emerge and how they are related.\n3. Connect people, projects and places: We use the semantic social network visualisation as a tool to matchmake participants over shared interests based on what they need, and what they wish to offer. as a thank you to people who contributed to the conversation.\n4. Cocreate a **professional matchmaking and coaching ** solution for mission oriented people. We come together at a workshop during the festival. In it we use what we have learned learnings int a tool that individuals can use to help them find their way to where they can make the most impact. And make meaningful connections between people who can help one another to get there.\n\nThe good news is that it is totally doable. In fact, it is already in motion - all we need is to grow what is already happening!\n\nOver the past months, several conversations have emerged around how we live and work in response to different facets of the same underlying problem: Stresses to the The Earth System.\n\nSome people like @martin  and @sander , people at Stockholm resilience center ++  are approaching the topic from a \u201czoomed out\u201d perspective \u2014 looking at historical and current data to understand how the different parts of the system are doing and making models of what we can expect if nothing changes. They trying to figure out the\u201cbig\u201d picture strategies and solutions for how to change course, or at least minimise the consequences. I\u2019m guessing most of the serious work around this is being done in or near research and innovation labs and is heavily dependent on people with specialised technical knowledge and skills (e.g in Universities). For example, they map emissions from different sectors: energy supply, industry, buildings, transport, food consumption, agriculture, forestry. Or they\u2019re developing advanced technologies that either are less emission intensive, zero carbon or carbon-negative.\n\nOthers are looking for solutions that are closest to them.  @William_COACT and Tristan's incubator for open source solutions to environmental problems is an example. Also @noemi and @alberto  are  tackling it on a professional level in part through the work they are leading in Edgeryders climate unit, but also at home through the co-living experiment they have been running which they are now scaling up with the reef. @matthias is at the faaaaaaar (ahead) end in how he closely his everyday life and values and work are aligned around this (Inge wrote about [Matt's story here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/this-cto-has-lived-off-the-grid-in-his-truck-for-several-years-here-s-why/10801)). Chris working on getting tech companies and technologies who build things for them to take measures like switching to renewable energy sources. @janetgunter 's work on reducing electronic waste @samim 's [hands on experimentation](https://ecospace.net/ ) around cultivation and ecological research. \n\nYou can also find people doing work on rewiring relationships by changing how information and resources flow as a tool to drive change. For me mobilising and coordinating protests as well as building infrastructures and processes for decentralisation, or pushing for better policy to help places, organisations, movement and ultimately citizens be more resilient to shocks in the system. I would say,  @Zelf , @jean_russell , @phoebe  , @pbihr  , and @julyandavey and  are in this space. Definitely Thoma's work on d[ecolonialising the production of, and access to,  science and knowledge](https://www.projetsoha.org/) in Africa and Haiti.\n\nOr there\u2019s Ramy,  @anthony_di_franco  , @Elise @winnieponcelet @rachel @thomasmboa (check out the work @rmchase  and many many others who creating accessible solutions for alternatives meeting material needs in different domains.\n\nBut, making the transition from one to the other is not a given, or even finding your way to them. Once individuals find your way there, the cost on the person running the initiative (who is often under-resourced) to help onboard you is also demanding. \n\n**what is a sustainable mechanism to help people find their way to contribute?**. This is something I have been thinking about a lot lately.

You can imagine: IOT, cloud computing, AI (in the sense of Bayesian statistics). Their evolution has profound consequences on our lives, yada yada \u2013 and they had the good sense of putting in there references to (1) industry 4.0, i.e. European industrial policy and (2) the circular economy, which can easily be expended into the EU's Green New Deal.\n\nCitizen engagement with technological development would not be a bad thing. The issue is, there is a reason why people are generally not engaging with this stuff, even less so on EU turf. It's difficult, technical, fairly boring, we all have better things to do with our lives. In ER, we normally assume that citizen engagement is a scarce resource, that must be paid for in something: normally, power (\"I participate in making a decision, the decision then is binding\"). Here, there is nothing of the kind. No social contract. \n\nOn the other hand, ER and many other spaces are discussing this sort of stuff anyway. Also, the project is small-ish, think 200K (for us), even less. Also, we can try to conjure some kind of social contract, with things like fellowships, residencies etc. etc., as we have done in the past. We can, further, find synergies with other ER activities, such as the SF-ECON Lab. There is even one item where we could deliver some impact, and it is this:\n\n> Recommendations and tested activities for citizen engagement in technologies, usable by industry, procurers (such as cities) and other stakeholders\n\nThis is up our street, because we are quite opinionated as to how citizen engagement on tech policy should happen. We are also, it seems, considered on the frontier when it comes to participation. \n\nSo, I see two possibilities. \n\n1. We engage with the consortium and support the proposal. We make sure that it does not overpromise, i.e. the promises are realistic. We do a lot of content recycling from NGI, etc. The project, should it win, becomes a nice thing, but we do not allow it to become a threat looming over us because we promised a lot of excitement on relatively little money. It could also be a nice ground for the people who started working with us on the current batch of projects: Maria, Zmorda, Marina herself, with a more hands-off approach from the board. \n\n2. We admit that we do not have capacity, especially given that we start from an unclear social contract with the project's future community, and decline their offer.\n\nThoughts?", "created_at": "2020-01-21 16:14:09.049870", "updated_at": "2020-01-21 16:14:09.049870", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 448, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 16.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 47340, "user_id": 4022, "topic_id": 9026, "post_number": 14, "raw": "Looking at travel time it looks like it might be a bit too much time in transit if we'd want to have a hackathon in Medenine before the development week, seeing that some people would just be joining for a long weekend.

The disturbing part is that, as soon as you identify the problem, you are carried all the way to the theory of value. I am reminded of my days as an economics student (which, come to think of it, I still am - but it meant different things back then): we had some pretty interesting intellectual fossils to play with, stuff that could have spun a whole other economics but didn't. One of them was the view, prevailing in the early 19th century, that you DON'T need to value an hour of human labor, because an hour of human labor is THE UNIT OF MEASURE that you use to measure other things. This\u00a0 view, known as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_theory_of_value\">Labor theory of value</a>, makes a lot of sense in the context of your example.\n\nI myself have argued\u00a0 elsewhere that <a href=\"http://www.cottica.net/2012/02/16/basic-income-as-innovation-policy/\">basic income can be deployed as innovation policy</a>. People - especially young people - want to save the world anyway, and if they know their bills are paid a lot more of them will give it a go. This might sound radical, as you say, but it is actually pretty mild compared to throwing the whole mainstream value theory out the window.

The simplest project eval tool is a test on the hypothesis that\u00a0\n\nvariable you are trying to affect <strong>with</strong> the project = variable you are trying to affect <strong>without</strong> the project\n\nIf the test rejects the hypothesis, you have impact.\n\nApart from the obvious problems of finding the counterfactual etc, this has a problem: you need enough\u00a0datapoints to support your rejection. \"Enough\" gets complicated quickly:\u00a0it depends on the size of the difference between the value of the variable with/without the project, on assumptions on the distributions of the error term in each realisation of the experiment etc.\u00a0But basically: the more datapoints you have, the more accurate your test.

So when Google showed up traffic flocked to them fast and big and the others all went out of business.  Apple was struggling when they came out with the iPhone. Again, such a better product everyone wanted one.  In the mid 90s I heard Jeff Bezos say, \"we're going to obsess about our customers and make our competitors obsess about us.\"  And they have done that.  From a customer perspective I have never had a bad experience with them.\n\nI think the trouble comes when those big players adopt anti-competitive and other consumer-unfriendly practices.  And I think all of those big orgs do that in various ways.  So, if the companies do that and the public likes their products enough to keep using them regardless, then what is left besides some sort of regulation?  This I think is the era we are in now in its early stages.", "created_at": "2020-07-28 18:38:40.397818", "updated_at": "2020-07-28 18:38:40.397818", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 246, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 22.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [80977], "is_liked_by": [6715], "is_private": false}, {"id": 66657, "user_id": 3622, "topic_id": 12063, "post_number": 19, "raw": "@felix.wolfsteller They are rendered in browser at the moment, and it's a good point about archiving and search crawl.

We believe that artistic practices can help make a green lifestyle more aspirational. Three vibrant &lsquo;curatorial hubs&rsquo; will show how change is possible. Deep green community art is:\n\n* Co-created: professional artists, social innovators and diverse city dwellers collaborate online and install the work in the cultural spaces\n* Functional: practical artistic artefacts respond to concrete needs of spaces (i.e. energy saving, waste reduction etc)\n* Replicable: the works are all created using an open process and are open source.\n* Empowering: we blaze the trail for many out there looking for new ways.\n\nActivities would take place in two types of spaces.\n\n- Online: the edgeryders active community platform https://edgeryders.eu/c/culture-squad\n- Onsite at each hub&rsquo;s location: The Reef (BE), The Place in Bedford (UK), and Blivande in Stockholm (SE).\n\nThree phases are tightly integrated with each other:\n\n1. Co-creative online process (Mar/Apr 2019). Each partner launches an open call for &lsquo;deep green&rsquo; art works, inviting project ideas, people and artists altogether. It results in three artists appointed to coordinate an act of community production.\n2. Community workshops in partners&rsquo; spaces (May). Three day sessions where artists and community members produce, install and exhibit the art. Walk-in, inclusive workshops.\n3. Documentation and dissemination (Jun/Jul 2019). Ongoing networked storytelling ensures all the ideas presented can circulate broadly on the Internet and involve new people in the process.

Od maja 2018.godine vodim i Nacionalnu Asocijaciju Zelenih Krovova Srbije, od kada intenzivno radim na edukaciji svih relevantnih aktera u ovoj oblasti. Do samog razvoja Asocijacije do\u0161la sam kroz saradnju na jednom predivnom projektu pod nazivom Zeleni koncept stanovanja, koji je po\u010detkom 2019.godine u potpunosti i realizovan u okviru stambenog objekta izgra\u0111enog u Novom Sadu. \n![F57%20small|690x460](upload://c3kBKmtxQfkdT1JOqz0ExUtr1jD.jpeg) \nZeleni koncept stanovanja predstavlja direktan odgovor na najve\u0107e sistemske nedostatke sa kojima se u gradu susre\u0107emo poput: neure\u0111enog sistema primarne selekcije otpada, izuzetne zaga\u0111enosti vazduha i sve \u010de\u0161\u0107e poplavljenih ulica.

Zatim su u objektu implementirane i zelene terase sa automatskim zalivnim sistemom i prethodno posa\u0111enim biljkama kako bi se formirala zelena barijera izme\u0111u ulice i unutra\u0161njosti objekta, kao i zeleni krov na samom vrhu objekta, oaza tj zajedni\u010dko dvori\u0161te za sve stanare.

I have been employed in the non profit sector as a Project Manager on various projects, after having explored and tested theatrical/drama techniques and incorporating that into Science Communication and Health Messaging. And let me tell you, I am completely motivated and inspired by this community and others toward this goal and Public Engagement.\n\nMy experience as a process facilitator includes various participatory methods including: photovoice, drama, collaborative/participatory video, workshop design and events design. I've resigned from my formal job in order to test additional methods which I believe have the power to stimulate dialogue, forge relationships across difference sectors and reach larger audiences in organic, fun and interactive means.\n\nSince resigning from my formal employment, I've begun developing concepts using Street Arts and collaborations to install live arts installations driven toward Public Engagement. Now, Public Engagement as a term itself is not void of ambiguity and misuse for the purpose of funding or green-stamping our professional works. This isn't anyone's fault as it's a field that is developing. We should strive for full participation in our works, not merely using the term as a stamp of approval. Our project aims to forge relationships with very different bodies of knowledge and social status, i.e. biomedical professionals/scientists, community members and artists, all of whom I argue have equally important and necessary knowledge to combat illness, increase the status of general Public Health and, simply put, fight a battle using a full arsenal of knowledge and weapons. \n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a08f727e3497eb6eef69eb85a97aeaf3b2e694cc.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\">\n\nAllow me to rewind, ever so slightly to paint a picture. I've previously sought to test photovoice as a participatory method by forging relationships with community members from an under-resourced community in Cape Town, South Africa, and Scientists from the University of the Western Cape. The project sought to bring these varied parties together in a participatory workshop process, after which community members were trained on DSLR cameras and instructed to capture the lived experience of food in their everyday lives. They could capture anything related but not limited to the purchase, consumption or disposal of food. This project revolved around Cardiovascular disease and the Scientists involved were Seniors at the Cardiovascular Research Unit at the University of Stellenbosch. The array of visual material and accompanying narrative was phenomenal and utterly beautiful. It shed light on the constant negotiation of food and consumption in these communities, including the availability of food, what kind of food was deemed healthy or not, when it was suitable for food to be disposed, food as celebration and community building etc. To me, and the Scientists involved, this process unveiled knowledge on food consumption behaviour and more structural issues imposed on these communities. It was never simply a \"<em>I want KFC and I shall buy KFC\"</em>. This food choice is always compounded by budget, compromise, available options, time of the month, etc. People are consciously and constantly negotiating and re-negotiating choices. My heart broke when a Senior member of the project sample pulled me aside mid-project and told me ...\n\n<em>\"Nabeel, I've suffered from Type 2 Diabetes for 15 years. At least thats what the doctors told me. They gave me medication and send me away each month. But never before has anyone told me what Diabetes is in a way that I understand. Never before have they taken time to talk with me. But now I have these scientists in my backyard. And they can't leave until I know my body</em>\"...\n\nIt's necessary to point out that even though this community has an approximate population of 100 000 it only has one superstore that either of us would immediately turn our back on. Most food products are sourced from small kiosks on the corners. Yes, I am still in shock. How and why are the most vulnerable excluded from knowledge and provision of services? An alarm bell rang in my head that I could not ignore since I resigned. We've been running projects with a very specific agenda which more often than not in the non-profit sector provides an income and life for the administering organization. The sad truth is peoples' knowledge and expression are not given the kudos and respect it desperately needs. And in this battle, that may just be our most prize weapon. \n\nFastforward 8 months and I've developed a concept with others (including Infers Group and may own company Interfer) which: 1. aims to bring 3 very different bodies of knowledge together in a participatory, collaborative and egalitarian process; 2. forge relationships between these traditionally-deemed exclusive fields, i.e. arts and science and; 3. test organic and participatory processes to create events and arts installations that extends this knowlege to a broader audience in a fun interactive means.\n\nNow. Back to my current mini-project... \n\nI have recently collaborated with the University of Cape Town's Swallowing the World project which is a curatorial project focused on the lived experience of TB. My team of graffiti artists and I joined the festival, set up 2.5 x 2.5m canvas in the middle of campus and contributed to this project on International TB Day. As the focus of the fest was on Destigmatization, we followed suit and allowed interaction between the audience and ourselves to influence or define the artpiece. A short video of our work:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/2NCOAeipD9k \n\nThis project will be installed in South Africa, India and Botswana simultaneously and attempts to use culturally- and community-sensitve street art forms. As such, we are holding participatory principles as central to the success of the project as we would like to design the project trajectory, outcomes and art installations/events with all participants. You may be thinking that no Funder finds this ideal. Alas, we're all wrong! We have had alot of interaction with a potential funder who chose to view the testing phase on UCT in livetime. This live time viewing feature of our project is something we would want to function very much like Edgeryders as it allows for collaborations and creativity between individuals and entities that may not traditionally interact. \n\nThis leaves me at your feet as I'd love feedback, interaction and potentially consider collaborations with not only this project but others moving forward. I'd love to work in varying contexts and establish relationships between and across scientists, community members and artists from varying countries. This will be my next step. Apart from the actual arts installations and events, as products, we will be developing a best practices publication focused on the entire project in each 3 countries. I will also carry my \"researcher\" hat for the duration of this project as I wish to study: the interaction; immediate knowledge transfer between scientists, community members and artists; retained knowledge and overall impact.

It directs the traffic of humanity through the creation of cultural, social, and material space. But do we feel empowered to direct? To design?\n> \n> Most moments of our existence are touched by design. We all sketch, we fashion trial balloons, we tinker with thoughts and concepts, we revise, we prototype, we analyze and critique, and we build. And then build again.\n> \n> Design intersects with science and art. We design experiments for research, scientific visualizations, and genetic models. We design performances, texts, and communication. We design gardens, houses, and cities. We create small and large. We find beauty in experience and efficiency.\n> \n> Design often mimics the intricate and perfect connections of healthy biological systems that nurture life. Yet design can also create destruction and chaos, or limit our participation and humanity. How might we explore this fantastic and perilous labyrinth of connections and implications bound up with art, science, and design?\n> \n> **The open call is an invitation to explore the world of design and its intersection with art and science. We invite proposals that address a wide range of subjects and themes, including the following:**\n> \n> ## **POTENTIAL SUBTOPICS AND THEMES**\n> \n> * What would a world without design be like?  \n> * How might design influence our vision and creative process? Our desires? Our identities and the identities of the world?\n> * How could biodesign restructure, improve, and restore our lives, or damage and destroy them?\n> * What might we learn from the ways that artists structure their studios, and the ways that scientists lay out equipment and material in their labs?\n> * Could we design ways to have our consciousness and cognitive acts leave traces beyond the death of our body?\n> * How does design expertise interact with a participatory design process? How can we design spaces where experts and non-experts build together?\n> * Could we create a participatory process for designing the future?\n> * How might design conjure up a beautiful, eerie, exciting, or creepy anticipation of the future?\n> * How might we think about vernacular design?\n> * What is the past and future of the relationship between nature, biology, and design?\n> * How does design direct intentions?\n> * How can we deal with the fact that design is both magical and dangerous?\n> * How could design not suppress the chaotic, unexpected, improbable, and disruptive?\n> * How might we design spaces and communities for highly mobile geographically nomadic groups of people?\n> * How could we address the trauma of digital data and selves becoming commodified, transacted, and controlled and suppressed?\n> * Could design guide a desirable transformation of society toward an equitable sustainable state?\n> * How do the designs of our technologies reflect or challenge our biases?\n> \n> ## **SEND US YOUR PROPOSAL TO BE IN THIS EXHIBITION!** \n> \n> Experimentation, provocation and research are at the heart of SGD\u2019s values and programs. This exhibition will explore the practice and concept of design through the lens of artists, psychologists, storytellers, digital gamers, molecular biologists, performers, neuroscientists, designers, computer scientists, nurses, engineers, musicians, mathematicians, architects, and young people. The list of possibilities is endless.  \n> \n> Your proposal could be a new or existing artwork, performance, workshop, digital intervention, research project, virtual reality game, or other activity. We strongly recommend that you keep our target audience of young people aged 15-25 years in mind and consider including interactive or participatory elements. We would love humor to feature in the exhibition.

When I moved there in 2001, for various reasons, almost nobody rode bikes. It was quite scary. By the time I moved out, ten years later, things had gotten much better. \n\nThis was not led by the city government. It was pushed by civil society, and specifically from small groups of \"extreme cyclists\". I told the story before [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/cycling-for-people-with-paralysis-how-do-we-researchers-and-citizens-contribute-to-more-testing-and-usability-of-technologies-like-fes/726/6?u=alberto): \n\n>  [...] young, fit men who wore tactical backpacks, army boots and yelled at drivers, and even kicked at their cars. I could just about cope: my (Swedish) wife refused to cycle, saying it was too dangerous. Extreme bikers did things like this:\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/1/11a17d67f639a63ee13b23948ecf39e174f423ba.jpg\nBut over the years those extreme people have become sort of cool. A company called Urban Bike Messengers established a bicycle-based delivery service. They cultivated an image of green, cool and a bit scary. Rumour was that, to become a messenger, you had to pass a near-impossible test of crossing the city only in minutes. This encouraged more people to go out and bike. This, in turn, made biking a little safer for everyone, because drivers learned to be a little more attentive. So even more people got out. By the time I left the city, the Decathlon shop in Cairoli was selling 50 to 100 bicycles _a day_. Eventually, the city council started to take cyclists a bit more seriously; traffic was restricted in the center, some slightly better bike lanes appeared. \n\nIn later years (by this time I had left the city), Milan's civically minded cyclists decided to tackle the problem of bicycle lanes. They just go out at night with white paint and draw them! I remember a candidate mayor's own team doing this as part of the mayoral election campaign in 2011. But now there must be a group of \"guerrilla bike lane makers\" in town. \n\nThis is a street called via Cartesio, about a month ago ([article](http://milano.corriere.it/foto-gallery/cronaca/17_luglio_08/piste-ciclabili-abusive-piazza-repubblica-via-cartesio-cavalcavia-bussa-isola-aa071212-63ec-11e7-87e3-ee600ad1b24a.shtml), in Italian)\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/e/ea65af8bb4d2cbecdfe99b6aa48bfa3d76a2a010.jpg\n\nA month before, on a railway bridge (Cavalcavia Bussa):\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c1e8495e2b9798b9490e96f4fbe8b84965ebc3dc.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"457\">\n\nMedia report that drivers normally respect these DIY bike lanes.

The widget in now.edgeryders.eu however is not free, either: it's using the paid plan of [daily.co](http://daily.co), a good video conferencing API. We haven't tested it to capacity yet, but [they claim](https://www.daily.co/pricing) \"Participants in room: 200\".\n\nAs far as I've heard from @owen, it does not rely on WebRTC when there are more than a handful users in a room. And then \u2013 if they provide a backbone server just like Zoom \u2013 I don't really see an a priori reason why video conferencing in a browser is impossible to get right? Browsers can play video alright, and if that's what they get served from the backbone server (as one combined video, perhaps), it should just work \u2026 . But yea, we didn't test that much. You'd have to try.\n\nThe interesting aspect would of course be that you can embed the video conferencing widget into your open source website.

Lots of interesting issues here: \n\n* US tech companies used to try to block and sue scrapers, until LinkedIn lost a lawsuit and the judge said that not only could they not sue, but also that they're not even allowed to try to block scraping by any technical means. Some people celebrated this as a triumph for free competition and the open web - welcome to the unintended consequences\n* At this stage face recognition is close to a commodity technology: if you can get the photos anyone can index them like this - indeed, a government could do this with driving licence or passport photos \n* In some ways this is a rerun of concerns around databases in the late 1970s and early 1980s: databases and now machine learning mean that things that had always been theoretically possible on a small scale became practically possible on a massive scale.

Apple is already doing this in iOS's Safari, which has the majority of mobile web use in the USA. This will both protect privacy and reduce the value of current publisher ad models, such as, say, the NY Times, since they will know less about you. Of course, by pure coincidence this doesn't affect what happens within a single closed-loop site, such as for Google search/search advertising, or Facebook. In other words, by protecting privacy, Google (and Apple) make ads on Google and Facebook more attractive and weaken most other ad models.

Will send it off now but feel free to feedback whenever and I can incorporate as things move forward. \n\n**Title:** Open science techniques for resilient and autonomous ecosystems of care\n**Format:** Workshop\n**Overview** This workshop will reference the Edgeryders network's approaches in using open science towards autonomous care solutions. Specifically, it will explore the decentralized and collaborative flows of open science as seen on Edgeryders; from concrete DIY resources for peer-to-peer production, supply and distribution through to knowledge sharing infrastructures and on to a shared vision across a global community. The format of a workshop has been chosen based on Edgeryders' approach to collective intelligence and dialogue. \n\n**1. Which communities to you want to speak about - i.e scientists,HCP's,rural in LMIC settings?** \nThe offer will reference the Edgeryders network broadly, with two specific community use cases, one in an LMIC setting. Edgeryders is an online community of 4000+ hackers, activists, radical thinkers and doers, and just normal people that want to make a difference. Funded by the likes of the European Commission, the World Bank and the United Nations, it both serves the community and uses its collective intelligence to power its own activities. \n\n**2. IS this based upon work you are already doing? If so examples pls.**\nYes. Overarching insights shared come from the OPENCARE project, an Horizon2020 funded research and innovation action which prototyped a community-driven model of addressing social and health care, and explored its implications at scale. Entitled Open Participatory Engagement in Collective Awareness for REdesign of Care Services, it drew on three elements: advances in collective intelligence research, advances in digital fabrication and cheap-and-open hardware technology; and the rise of a global hacker community.\nSpecific case studies for this workshops include two Edgeryders' network projects in development. \na) OpenInsulin: a global cooperative working on the first freely available, open protocol for insulin production\nb) Mboalab: a Research Center on Open Science (Citizen sciences, Open, DIY, Hacking, Making\u2026) based in Yaound\u00e9 Cameroon aimed at providing a better life to local populations through research\n\n**3.

The contrast might be best understood as follows: The\n\n\"edge\" exists within a system and its peripheral and emergent character is what defines its edginess. But there is also the \"edge\" which is extra systemic, not on the edge because there is no center, new systems, with new centers and edges may or may not be emerging.\u00a0 Such novelty is unknowable in advance and is very difficult to make sense of from within the existing system, even from the edge of existing systems. To me what getting beyond a control room means is that we become much more accepting and interested in the non-causal, non-narrative based sense making that is rooted in what we already know about center/periphery and adaptation - which must adapt from what exists.\u00a0 The ideas is to crowd surf novel emergence, without knowing if it is center or periphery or has causal origin or direction or meaning. The control room tracks the planes, avoids collisions and plans take-offs. The control room changes when GPS allows all planes to track the other planes, and this is a unknowable and emergent change that comes in from the edge. To paradigm shift out of this view of agency - making better control rooms that integrate the edge - towards a combination of planning and improvisation requires a shift away from the current planning oriented pretensions of agency and a bias towards understanding new things as adaptations or 'rational' from the perspective of the old systems.\u00a0 Things happen and we can dance with those phenomena in ways that were not dance in the past. This is being and not-being; doing and not-doing from the POV of discontinuity and non-continuous complex emergent novelty.\n\nHope this is helpful.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-08-20 11:37:44", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:24.385417", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 370, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 41360, "user_id": 3729, "topic_id": 7991, "post_number": 4, "raw": "hi @Ali im tantawy form Egypt also =)  really nice introduction i like it very much , \ni may be interested to know what did you produce on machine learning at home automation .im already working on project related to furniture so we may find cross cutting fields >\nplease check : \n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/bitcut-open-source-furniture-platform/6999\n\nwaiting your response", "created_at": "2018-01-22 08:48:18.563879", "updated_at": "2018-01-22 08:48:18.563879", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 61, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 27.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [35804], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4267], "is_private": false}, {"id": 51621, "user_id": 932, "topic_id": 9076, "post_number": 46, "raw": "it is strange indeed, but it's not an issue with CSS, rather it's an issue with the slider not getting properly initialized (but no js errors are shown ...)", "created_at": "2019-03-13 07:11:39.597720", "updated_at": "2019-03-13 07:11:39.597720", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 30, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 6.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [51617], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 34743, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 6359, "post_number": 3, "raw": "If we are doing any exhibitions or performances on this theme, Ars electronica has a fellowship for artists on the topic.

It should be noted here that before the armed conflicts in English speaking parts of Cameroon, the target groups which our project is targeting were once school going people. And yes they can read,write, understand and speak the English language , because i and my dedicated team of volunteers in Cameroon in the region hard hit by the armed conflicts, had done a rapid needs assessment to over 1000 internally displaced persons to understand their suffering, pains and analyse their deplorable conditions. \nSo,  since the separatist have issued warnings for schools not to take place, we realized that many violations on gender based violence such as denial of resources, wrong and doubtful information on sex education, sexual violence, stigma for girls menstruating was very common and we were moved to come up with an innovative way of empowering these vulnerable groups and their parents on correct and systematic information on comprehensive sexuality education which will help them to make informed decisions. \nThis project will help to break myths surrounding menstruation, puberty, engage boys to be supportive and understanding especially during periods where girls and menstruating in a bit to curb stigma and as well as inspire parent children discussion on Sex education back at homes which is the main factor for menstruation to be popularized as a taboo.  I personally believe that \"All women were once girls, but not all girls will have the opportunity to become women\", if they are not empowered to make informed choices. \nAgain, the armed conflicts have been going on for about 3 years now and presently there are no camps or urban displacement centers for Internally displaced Persons (IDPs) so most of them are in the homes of friends, relatives or living in abandoned buildings just to have a roof over their head.\nSo the idea therefore, of the MP3 players with spoken word contents on reproductive health is an innovation I and @trythis have worked tirelessly and effortlessly to inspire a new way of learning which is cost effective, exciting, inspiring and fun. This way, we will be able to carry the MP3 players to other locations, after we are done with other target groups. This will defeat the conventional ways of holding information events, workshops and seminars . \nWe intend to make this project a mobile one which other vulnerable groups in rural and peri-urban areas will be able to benefit from it and be empowered as well.\n\nFYI:.... After carrying out needs assessment  from IDP's, we discovered a whole new ways to intervene to save lives , give hope and restore their faith in humanity. In the nearest future, we will be carrying out a distribution project to assist internally displaced Persons of Food items and non food items.\nThe other thing which we plan to do is on Education in Emergencies (EIE) and we are hoping to use the renewable concept of solar lamps to inspire learning among displaced families and their kids .\nWe already have the big idea help people not only in Cameroon, but in other countries affected by natural disasters or armed conflicts around the World under the Banner of ...  \"Mother Of Pearls\"\nI think @trythis has more details on that.

I will take that as license to brain-dump here then ;) Of note, I will speak from personal observation & talks with the larger group of Open Insulin Project collaborators, but would not say that I speak _for_ them. So @winnieponcelet @dfko @thomasmboa please feel free to jump in too!   \n\nI think a big theme would be around having a global strategy for local production for Open Insulin. What we have talked about here and in other fora is the idea that localized production would be key in spreading the technology or group intelligence, that the scientists and others are working on across physical and cultural boundaries. The collective knowledge, the means of production, can be seen as capital that can be used appropriately in hyperlocal economic and cultural contexts. What this allows for is creating unique meaning to how the technology is to be deployed without any one person or entity to the actual mode of distribution, which is crucial to open science. No one can horde the technology in an ideal sharing situation. \n\nHere is a quote from a post that I read recently that I have been thinking about a lot as to the power of the open insulin project (really good read, especially midway, about cosmolocalism): \n\"Fablabs, makerspaces, emerging global knowledge commons\u2026 These are but some of the outcomes of a growing movement that champions globally-sourced designs for local economic activity. Its core idea is simple: local ownership of the means to produce basic manufactures and services can change our economic paradigm, making our cities self-sufficient and help the planet.\" \nsource: http://magazine.ouishare.net/2017/11/cosmo-localization-can-thinking-globally-and-producing-locally-really-save-our-planet/\n\nI think this is especially important to think about cosmolocalism in the context of decolonization of science, health (human bodies) and even open science. And what draws me to continually work with the Open Insulin group is that the agency in the knowledge-production is not contingent on a colonial mindset, even at this stage in collaboration.\n\nIn practice, what this means is that the Mboa labs for example, could produce their own insulin, create media (as @ThomasMboa has done on Facebook around diabetes awareness and insulin), storytelling, foster partnerships and strategies, wholly rooted in the the local context. This is what I think success would look like for the OpenInsulin project, globally. \n\nLast, there is the idea of launching a patient coop for OI, which we'd like to plan for the patients and producers controlling not only processes, but also the valuable health data that are produced from say, controlled trials. This kind of coop in theory, could allow individual actors to own the data that has traditionally been owned by corporations. We are also hoping this kind of coop would allow the technology to get into the hands of those who need it quickly, and not have to wait on the beauracratic processes in place that are oftentimes onerous and significantly slowing, and not always centered around the humans that should really have more say about how they want to create health in their own bodies and also their communities, local and beyond.", "created_at": "2018-02-09 04:59:48.083255", "updated_at": "2018-02-09 04:59:48.083255", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 555, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 117.8, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [41688], "is_reply_to": [41688], "is_liked_by": [4063, 3362, 3904], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30882, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 6167, "post_number": 15, "raw": "<b>Two more things we should discuss in Bordeaux</b>\n\n(At least from the Edgeryders side)\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Touch base on the OpenVillage event. @noemi in the lead.</li>\n\n<li>Touch base on the \"integration\" papers.

Right now, this seems rare because time banks are local systems and people can develop trust, and are generally made up of honest time-banking enthusiasts anyway.

So if some people in edgeryders want to make a move to have a deep/permanent presence in the region we have three things to do in the prototype house:\n\n1) Identify a first set of social innovation/entrepreneurship projects for people to work on while in the house (residency).Train them on how to build and manage community around their initiatives\n\n2) Build a credible **_business model_ for the space** & **_sustainability model_ for the patient incubation**. \n\n3) Recruit the core group of people who want to try this experiment together in a full on house that we barinraise around together\n\nPing @hazem and @unknown_author what say you about this? \n \nBTW: I'm en route to Beirut and I have a long stopover in Tunis tonight if anyone is around for a spontaneous meetup tonight or a VERY early breakfast tomorrow morning", "created_at": "2017-09-21 17:36:46.249710", "updated_at": "2018-03-09 19:41:32.142597", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 365, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 44.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [36755], "is_liked_by": [4065, 4448], "is_private": false}, {"id": 49658, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 9308, "post_number": 7, "raw": "@Matteo: I am with Alberto on this - I think the tested strategy of selling the SSNA is what we have the strongest in our favor.

Could we perform SSNA on Decidim?\n\n### The general problem\n\nSSNA is a general method. In theory, given API access, it can operate on data coming from any platform. The full form (the second S in SSNA) happens when the different units of text analyzed are utterances in a conversational environment; that includes blogs, Twitter, fora, chats and many other media. In practice, however, \"platform culture\" matters. \n\nFor example, you could in theory do SSNA on a chat log... but chats make low quality ethnographic material. Most posts are super-short things like \"OK\", \"LOL\", \"Thanks man\" and similar. Even those that are not will tend to rely heavily on contextual knowledge, because *the writer knows exactly who is reading*. Writers of blogs or long-form fora write at least in part for an audience of strangers, hence they take time to develop their arguments, justify their claims etc.\n\nAdditionally, the length of the post is a problem. As it is done on Edgeryders, SSNA induces an edge between two codes when they have been used to annotate the same post. If posts are very short, they end up being poor in codes, and therefore in connection between codes. The graph becomes very sparse. Of course, we could redefine our methodological assumptions, and decide that two codes are connected if they occur in posts that were written within 10 minutes of each other. In this case, we could even have *directed* co-occurrence edges, with the code annotating the later post liking back to the code annotating the earlier post, but not vice versa. But that's tricky: any methodological assumption needs to be justified. We have made a justification for those we currently use, but any new one would need to be scrutinized from scratch.\n\n### On Decidim\n\nNow, to Decidim. Decidim is not mainly a forum: it incorporates decision making tools. It seems more of a management tool applied to democracy (\"a political network to make decisions... organize meetings, take pledges...\") than a tool for collective intelligence and sensemaking. In fact, they also market it to corporations, which are not democracies. \n\nI tried to join a civic one, which is probably the most famous one: https://decidim.barcelona. This contains several (currently 6) high-level participatory processes, which in turn contain proposals, which can be (1) commented, (2) upvoted, (3) \"followed\" (you get notifications on updates).  The *highest* number of comments on a proposal of the * Plan Barcelona Interculturalidad* which is one of the six, is... 0, out of 296 proposals. Another of the high-level processes, the  *Plan de Barrios*, is divided into several lower-level processes corresponding to each neighborhood (*barrios*). The maximum number of followers for a single barrio is 23. This barrio has 96 proposals: two of them have 1 comment each, 94 proposal have no comment. The maximum number of upvotes is 2. \n\nConclusion: on the up side, Decidim supports conversation on proposals. The conversation is threaded. The editor is very basic: no Markdown, no HTML. Currently, the length of comments is limited to 1,000 characters (this is probably easy to fix, since the code is open sourced.  \n\nOn the down side, even on its home turf, Decidim has not managed to built a brilliant track record for participation. Commenting is almost non-existant in Barcelona \u2013 but this can be put down to the designers having priorities other than sensemaking through conversations. But also upvoting is sparse. Proposals, on the other hand, are many \u2013 but it feels like proponents are shouting in the dark, a democracy without a demos. \n\nDecidim also contains other things, including a petition platform and 165 *organos de participaci\u00f3n*. These are like neighborhood councils, city committes on single issues (like migration, or children) and so on. Here is a comparison:\n\n| (on 2020-12-17)         | decidim.barcelona | edgeryders.eu |\n|-------------------------|-------------------|---------------|\n| Accounts                | 44,266            | 6,436         |\n| Participatory processes | 15                | /             |\n| Organs of participation | 165               | /             |\n| Proposals               | 24.574            | /             |\n| Threads                 | /                 | 14,279        |\n| Comments                | 26,786            | 73,109        |\n\nOver 10,000 of the proposals are \"accepted\", so I imagine decisions are made. Decidim measures its worth on this kind of activity, not so much on conversation. So, again, not really a tool for sensemaking. \n\nDoes anybody know better examples?\n\ncc @amelia @anthonyzach  \n\n\n![image|690x326](upload://zslTQZmxHmAUchG1zEWBCirHvoj.jpeg)", "created_at": "2020-12-17 12:56:02.666004", "updated_at": "2020-12-17 13:46:34.896584", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 728, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 26.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3310], "is_private": false}, {"id": 83806, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 14466, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2020-09-25 14:53:04.803718", "updated_at": "2020-09-25 14:53:04.803718", "deleted_at": "2020-09-25 14:57:15.319339", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4934], "is_private": false}, {"id": 36683, "user_id": 3311, "topic_id": 6683, "post_number": 18, "raw": "[quote=\"noemi, post:1, topic:6683\"]\ncommunity@edgeryders.eu\n[/quote]\n\nHi\n\nI would love to attend this Event.

Tailoring a glove is not easy stuff, this new model is designed to be easily reproduced with digital fabrication and basic sewing knowledge. Most important: this kind of glove can be easily worn also by those who have difficulty wearing normal gloves (stretching fingers and so on).\nTo make it functional and completely customizable we are working on a digital/parametric version: we studied hands dimensions to deliver a measurements chart that could be filled to modify the glove (we are looking for hands, by the way). The output will be a .dxf file that can be laser-cutted at any makerspace. \n\nHere the very first experiment:\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/4/452dc9d02dc5119089b6358eaa600d16ef57726d.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"391\">\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/0/041ad751f8a07b08c724ebe12affaa6c7c38b937.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"391\">\n\n\n_Technology_\nTechnologic development during OpenCare MIR was about searching for a micro controller worthy of the new glove, version 4.0, described above.\nWe selected curieNano micro controller of DFRobot, the evolution of Arduino Curie's board developed on Intel's SoC.\nA technological aspect we discovered is that the number of ADC inputs of the selected microcontroller is lower than the number of analog sensors on the glove.\nTo solve this problem we are developing an I2C interface board from which a microcontroller can acquire two analog sensors and transfer captured data with the I2C to the main microcontroller. Using I2C technology we can add many sensors that communicate with the Intel Curie Through a defined hexadecimal address. This technique allows to have many sensors connected to the glove and only 4 wires between each I2C and the glove brain (curieNano).\n\nHere a sample of the system we will use to connect the tiny microcontrollers.\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/3d722b9e97bff5dc3a54535059b9754e2f103410.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"391\">\n\nSoon for further developments!\nMauro & Sara", "created_at": "2017-08-09 14:37:10.641263", "updated_at": "2018-11-22 21:33:08.423315", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 379, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 127.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 3703], "is_private": false}, {"id": 70504, "user_id": 4096, "topic_id": 12164, "post_number": 122, "raw": "Wanted to share my update too.

The ultimate goal is to work collectively to make this building carbon negative.*****\n\n# About The Reef\n\nMore than two years ago, a few of us decided to rent a house and an office space together, to share our working and personal lives, and improve our lifestyles. After running this as a prototype with 4-6 people, we want to impact urban living more, in Europe and beyond. We are now building the next iteration and searching for a bigger space to move into.\n\n![The%20Reef%20at%20present|690x467](upload://y7VgwXi9W1P6PsRnIyUwuqoZb55.jpeg) \n\nThe Reef is a community, and so is the building hosting it. It is a home, a workplace, a model. But it is also the seed for a new market of social, deep-green living. As a bold demonstrator, The Reef\nmakes such a lifestyle both realistic (for the people that live it) and aspirational (for many who do not \u2013 yet).\n\nThe Reef is infrastructure for a lifestyle adapted to the 21st century. A lifestyle that is:\n* Independent: combining privacy and sociability.\n* Healthy: built-in nudges towards healthy eating, exercising, burnout prevention.\n* Deep green: negative emissions living.\n* Affordable: an ecosystem of physical persons and small businesses increasing efficiency and helping contain the cost of living in buzzing cities.\n* Social and happy: several households living together under the same roof (up to 20 people). The first people to move into The Reef are going to be the colonizing species of the ecosystem. The Brussels space will function as a bioreactor. It co-designs new solutions, tries them out, improves upon them, consolidates successes.\n\nThe full story as told in the last couple of years:\n\n* [Spawning the Reef: Reinventing communal living and working](https://edgeryders.eu/t/spawning-the-reef-brussels-re-inventing-communal-working-and-living-again/6239)\n* [Growing the Reef in Brussels. Thoughts on sustainability](https://edgeryders.eu/t/growing-the-reef-in-brussels-some-initial-thoughts-on-sustainability/8930)\n\nThe Reef is an open-ended, community built project. In 2019 we wish to build a critical mass of supporters and partners around it: people who want to invest in their future, organisations who want to use space in it, public and private actors to champion a new kind of climate friendly urban space. \n\n## We start with Brussels. Join our team! What we need help with\n\n**A. Partnership Building**\n\n* identify 2-3 candidate spaces. This includes producing a map of unused buildings in Brussels. A point-of-interest map of \u2265100 unused buildings in Brussels that are of interest for The Reef, followed by detailed profiles of the best matching 2-3 buildings. Delivered as a collaborative, open map using uMap or similar.\n* secure 3-5 high quality partnerships. A high quality partner is a partner who holds resources and competences that are key for a successful Reef deployment. These include political and institutional legitimacy (public authorities), building expertise (real estate developers), a portfolio of real estate assets (public authorities/real estate developers/philanthropists), finance (banks or other financial institutions), green technologies (universities and private firms).\n\n**B. Community Outreach Support**\n\n* helps mobilize potential and future community members in an exercise of co-design for the 2-3 candidate spaces; Workshops are led by @Noemi, so you will be only supporting. They will be hosted in Brussels and engage a minimum 50 active contributors to The Reef design; The outputs are expected to be requirements for social and green transformation with the community at the centre.\n\n**Timeline:** The work is due from August/September 2019 to January/February 2019 (circa 6 months); the contract is renewable pending on future plans and resources.\n\n**Remuneration:** The salary covers part time work (up to 3 days a week) and is negotiated based on mutually agreed deliverables.\n\n**Conditions:** Be based in Brussels and have a diverse network here. Work from The Reef or from home office; team coordination using edgeryders.eu and other internal channels.\n\n## Interested? Here's how to apply\n\nIf you think you\u2019re a good fit for at least some of these activities, please reply below with a comment expressing your interest, skills, passions, and any links which could be useful as references to previous work.\n\nIf you like the project or wish to be involved in other activities coming up, we\u2019d love to get to know you! And please share this with anyone who could be enjoying this kind of work.\n\nOnce we find the right person we will announce it below and close the call.\n\nLooking forward to meet you &lt;3\n\n----------------------\n\n_*** Disclaimers: We have been advertising this opportunity through several other channels and we reserve the right to decide according to all incoming manifestations of interest. \nNB: While The Reef proposal has been accepted by our partners at Climate KIC, we are still pending a signature from the funding body.

One of the often ridiculed hallmarks of armchair citizen scientists is that they are sometimes open-minded types with active imaginations, seeing patterns and connections everywhere without much rigidity or statistical power to back it up. This is the sort of naivet\u00e9 that is beaten out of \"real\" scientists on the track to tenure, as [recently lamented by Avi Loeb](https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/.premium.MAGAZINE-if-true-this-could-be-one-of-the-greatest-discoveries-in-human-history-1.6828318) on the topic of Oumuamua.\n\nIs there a way for digital ethnography, network science and perhaps some smart AI to filter out interesting new hypotheses of real connection between phenomena from the noise of the crackpots? Could there be a way to identify when a new coherent hypothesis of connection between phenomena has been spawned, and is there a way to to weed out the posts of highest quality?

Or maybe badly structured employment contracts?_\n_Do salaries offered in your country guarantee a decent life?_\n_How is the work of women assessed?_\n\nDespite the economic development and decreasing social differences, there are many differences across countries in terms of offered support for job seekers and the unemployed.\n\n**Access to the labor market is difficult in smaller cities**, also for people with higher education. There is also lack of support or even understanding for working classes - in the form of solid education, training, professional training, helping to update knowledge and skills to the needs of the market. On the one hand, we are one of the best educated societies in Europe.\n\nOn the other hand, **the educational offer and the promise emanating from the universities are unmatched by reality.** Many of us are educated in the belief that a master's degree is a guarantee of success - which often turns out to be untrue, the more so if you do not want to move to one of the big cities and take a job in a corporation.\n\n**For those who decide to choose manual professions or crafts, we are often looked down on.** The common aspiration to work behind a desk, results in that other professions are often judged as &quot;failure&quot;, affecting, among other things, that we are ready to agree to starvation wages for many people whose daily effort has a huge impact on the quality of our lives. Not to mention the lack of respect for the professions keeping our cities, hospitals and homes in hygiene and cleanliness (for example), it spoils our relationships and creates unnecessary distance.\n\n**Another problem is the instability of work -** in recent years, the share of temporary employment contracts has increased in Europe, from 8.1% in 1983 reaching almost to around 14% in 2017. The effects of such a situation are unfavorable in the long run - Citizens of some part of Europe are considered more competitive and inexpensive labor forces with respect to others, but this applies mainly to less advanced professions. Such a situation does not facilitate further education, does not guarantee social mobility and, above all, does not give security practitioners safety.\n\n**Unemployment is also a problem - even among young people, up to 39% are still unemployed in some parts of Europe.** Many of them admit that finding a good occupation depends on happiness and contact, which means that some people decide to stay at home. Do you also think that finding a good job in your country is difficult for the same reasons? Or maybe there are other reasons?\n\n# We have created a special forum for this need, where we can safely talk about important topics. \nWe will avoid conflicts and insults here, we will provide all participants with the right conditions to express their own opinions and feelings.

Usually the same person will go in every week, reconcile transactions, look at pending transactions, and make payments. Not much overhead. The only case where discipline is needed is when somebody helps out in an urgent case to make a payment: they _must_ reconcile transactions and check pending payments first, or we get the double spending issue again. And since they are only helping out, the motivation to spend these extra 10 minutes is probably not high.

Open source solution could (should?) see a further jump into the mainstream these days, but it **needs to presented in a digestible form for the uninitiated** (make the damage more evident?), **and valid alternatives need to exist** (thinking of Signal VS WhatsApp here, for instance).\n</br>\n\nA practical example: with our little map-making business, I could talk endlessly about how more *beautiful, and useful,* is a map based on open-data that everyone can contribute to, and learn the ins and outs of mapping; but ultimately most people only care about having good maps to go hiking, and since Google maps is shit in the wilderness because there is no incentive for them to map those areas, our approach provide a better solution to their problem. That's what causes adoption of OSM-based maps for basically all hiking apps, not the philosophy behind it. Unfortunately.\n</br>\n\nI am aware you probably all know this already, and even likely have better shaped opinions and ideas about it all, but I just thought to share my thoughts anyway. I guess I like to take a very wide perspective on this topic, even though I am also practicing it in the day-to-day choices of our work, which is just a small, tiny, contribution to the broader conversation.\n</br>\n\nI don't know if this  will be useful, but I hope it will!\n</br>\n\nPS: The podcasts are not full unless you contribute by subscribing, but there is *plenty* already to go with the shorter versions.", "created_at": "2020-03-31 19:23:44.835789", "updated_at": "2020-03-31 19:29:50.825410", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 461, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 7.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 75951, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 13445, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Project Reference: NGI FORWARD 825652\n\n**1. What is the purpose of this research?**\n\nThe NGI Forward project is part of the Next Generation Internet (NGI) initiative, launched by the European Commission in the autumn of 2016. It attempts to understand how people are contributing towards building the evolution of the Internet and our digital technologies, against a backdrop of massive social, economic, ecological and political challenges. More info: https://exchange.ngi.eu\n\n**2. Do I have to take part?**\n\nNo. You can ask questions about the study before deciding whether or not to participate. If you do agree to participate, you may withdraw yourself and the data you have provided from the study at any time during the event, without giving a reason and without penalty, by advising the researchers of this decision. If after the interview/call you choose to withdraw, please contact Maria Kling.\n\n**3. What will happen if I take part in the research?**\n\nThe event takes place digitally. It consists of an open discussion, moderated by Edgeryders staff and or workshops provided by community members.\n\nIf you take part in the event you will be able to listen and contribute to the discussion.\n\nThe call will be recorded for reference purposes for the NGI research described above and the facilitator to improve similar webinars.\n\nEdgeryders staff will write a report of the call to be published in the platform to share all outcomes.\n\n**4. Are there any potential risks in taking part?**\n\nThe risks of participation are minimal and include for example involuntary data breach leading to sharing beyond the original intention. We are prepared and committed to prevent any of this.\n\n**5. Are there any benefits in taking part?**\n\nThere are no direct benefits to you for participating in this research study. As a result it may have indirect benefit to participants.\n\nAs a benefit of participating in the workshop part you will learn new skills that you will be able to use for your own projects and benefits.\n\nThere will be no payment for taking part in this study. The workshop is free.\n\n**6. How is the event documented?** (*ATTENTION: Changes to this section*)\n\nThis call is being recorded. **The recording will be used for transcription, inform follow-up summary articles and can be published by Edgeryders in parts or its entirety.** \nIf you are not comfortable with the recording of the conversation being published afterwards to further the discussion, you will have to abstain from this call.\nIf you do not want your name being mentioned in the summaries/recordings, please, use a synonym to join (for example your edgeryders user name) and inform us ahead of the call via the contact listed below.\n\n**7. Will the research be published?**\n\nOne or more writeups will appear on the NGI exchange platform (https://exchange.ngi.eu). Writeups will be attributed to their authors, not the participants. That is an open forum, so participants are welcome to use it to comment, respond, or contribute their own writeups.\n\nThe whole content of the exchange.ngi.eu forum (including the mentioned writeup, and any discussion about them) will then become the basis for at least one research report. We also hope to publish one or more journal article.\n\n**8. Who is organising and funding the research?**\n\nThe research is organised by Edgeryders and funded by the European Union via a research project called [NGI Forward](https://research.ngi.eu).\n\n**9. Who do I contact if I have a concern about the study or I wish to complain?**\n\nIf at any point you\u2019d like your contributions removed from the online forum, just ask one of the admins and they will happily take it down.\n\n\nYou can contact Maria Kling, Community Manager at Edgeryders here via a dm or ping @MariaEuler or via email me at maria.euler.art@gmail.com.", "created_at": "2020-05-07 09:57:59.642036", "updated_at": "2020-11-09 10:05:19.879817", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 643, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 48.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32461, "user_id": 2336, "topic_id": 3630, "post_number": 22, "raw": "<b>A little late answer to, well everything</b>\n\nHello!\u00a0\n\nFirst of all, i am terribly sorry for my lack of answers here.

To your questions Alex: Yes they are allowed to leave the camp. Its kind of hard for them to bring\u00a0friends inside who dont live there though (pretty weird feeling because it was so easy for us to enter)\u00a0\n\nWe actually had a little experiment today and brought materials like duckt tape, cable ties, strings, cardboard (materials that you dont necessarily need proffessional tools for) to one room to see what would happen. Just after a little time os insecurity they started finding solutions in terms of \"unpacking\". That seems to be the biggest issue.. The room is a organised mess and they wanted to have items to put their stuff in. It was a really cool experience to see how everyone together was solving problems. In the end we had two really nice shelf constructions!\n\nThere is a lot of unused material inside the camp, that\u00a0is going to be thrown away.. if there would be better communication between the organisation and the refugees they could probably use these too.. (to be fair: the Malteser who are running the camp are already having kind of good communication.. so far we only good positive feedback and lots of permissions!)\u00a0\n\nBut i really like the idea of going out of the camp to get materials,\u00a0also because in the end its about not only having the courage to hack the \"comfort zone\" but to feel able and free in the \"outside world\" (that is really a feeling of home)\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-05-18 21:24:31", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:58.330484", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 272, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 46238, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 8534, "post_number": 61, "raw": "Sure", "created_at": "2018-07-11 15:29:25.409804", "updated_at": "2018-07-11 15:29:25.409804", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 24.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 53089, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 9844, "post_number": 8, "raw": "[quote=\"manuelpueyo, post:7, topic:9844\"]\ni like the idea of creating a structured concept model of this subject. who would be the final user of this?\n[/quote]\n\nI think the final user would be the person/group who wants to get a space but doesnt know how to navigate the system, especially who are the people who hold the power to negotiate, the risks that come with that, and many more. \n\n[quote=\"manuelpueyo, post:7, topic:9844\"]\nusers of those spaces are also nomadic. they like to change.\n[/quote]\n\nHm, I missed that.. who mentioned it, or in what context?", "created_at": "2019-05-03 14:49:30.012257", "updated_at": "2019-05-03 14:49:30.012257", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 101, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 22.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [53088], "is_reply_to": [53088], "is_liked_by": [2567], "is_private": false}, {"id": 74744, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 13146, "post_number": 28, "raw": "ah!ok sorry", "created_at": "2020-04-21 13:43:32.624697", "updated_at": "2020-04-21 13:43:32.624697", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 3, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 1.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [74743], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 68913, "user_id": 6078, "topic_id": 12393, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Dear @HadeerGhareeb , please create a new post to update our community members about your project progress. \nAs for your offline tasks you can send it by private message using the edgeryders inbox if it is confidential or you can share it as an independent section on your follow up post so Mr @Wajdibr  can give you his feedbacks and your peers can also benefit from your discussion", "created_at": "2020-01-19 11:09:46.368352", "updated_at": "2020-01-19 11:09:46.368352", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 67, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 7.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [68911], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 51456, "user_id": 4861, "topic_id": 9578, "post_number": 1, "raw": "The European branch of the Global Ecovillage Network searches somebody to do an ESC (formerly EVS, European Voluntary Service) in [the ecovillage Arterra](http://www.arterrabizimodu.org) in Spain.\n\nIts on a short notice here, sorry: **application window closes on 22nd march 2019**.\n\nThe information on the following page is a bit \"off\" (like, mentioning 2018), but you will absolutely get the point.

We are continuously doing experimental work in the form of projects and ventures imagined and deployed by different constellations of individuals and organisations. Many are ephemeral collaborations that dissolve once the goals are met. Over time relationships form between people and organisations who choose to continue working with one another towards a shared vision. They become clusters.\n\n**How is this different from a network?** In a network, participants look for how to make the most of what others are doing. In a system, participants are willing to re-orient their work, so as to better work with the other participants. If you are a construction company, you must not be lazy, and be open to using new technologies. If you are a social cooperative, you must look away from providing standardized services to customizing what you do in order to better valorize the capabilities of the people they are assisting. And so on.\n\n  ## Current thematic clusters\n\n* **Environment and Climate**: EarthOS is our cluster of innovators around ecological living, ecosystem restoration and esp. climate change amelioration and adaptation. It is a set of experimental projects assembling community and diverse institutional partners to apply solutions to climate change and sustainability challenges in today\u2019s world as a house on fire. The findings from the projects serve as data points in developing new economic theory and models needed to enable transition to a sustainable future. ([More](https://edgeryders.eu/t/environment-and-climate/13485))\n\n* **Research & Development**: This cluster designs and deploys R&D activities including joint development of new open source technologies and common infrastructure upon which members can build new products and services. Members build meaningful research partnerships and pursue funding together. ([More](https://edgeryders.eu/t/research-network/13488))\n  \n* **Good Technology**: This cluster experiments what new technologies really should do for humanity and all it encompasses. Individuals and organisations in this cluster develop technologies guided by insights from open and inclusive dialogue on how technologies should work, be governed, financed and built. ([More](https://edgeryders.eu/t/good-technology/13496))\n\n* **Culture for Transformation**: This cluster connects and equips artists, producers, as well as researchers to experiment uses of culture as a tool for social change, and digital technology as a way to accelerate it.\n([More](https://edgeryders.eu/t/culture-for-transformation/13493))  \n\n\n* **Distributed Futures Lab**: This cluster equips leaders and organisations to better navigate the new reality. Member build tools and frameworks for activities, ventures and programs that are ideated and deployed by large numbers of individuals working together over the internet. ([More](https://edgeryders.eu/t/distributed-futures-lab/13476))\n\n* **One Health & Resilience**: This cluster takes a collaborative and interdisciplinary approaches to make sense of how to respond to links, interdependencies and commonalities of human and ecosystem health. ([More](https://edgeryders.eu/t/one-health-resilience/13494))\n* **Good Work & Life:**  We build a meaningful, productive and enjoyable work-and-life environment. It combines business incubation, P2P learning, socialisation and communal spaces.

You can navigate the tags and then go back to the comments.\n\n<img alt=\"Screen Shot 2017-07-12 at 17.18.16.png\" height=\"340\" src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6794dab8e5e24486525885dae75225380d5416f5\" width=\"624\">\n\nLink tags that co-occur in conversations. Look at links that appear more frequently. Slider helps to focus on strong links. This helps to analyse why these might be appearing more frequently.\n\nThis can be accessed following the url: http://graphryder.opencare.cc and a detailed view: <a href=\"http://164.132.58.138:9000/index.html#/dashboard/globalView\">http://164.132.58.138:9000/index.html#/dashboard/globalView</a>\n\nAware of the issues in terms of navigation around the various websites. Suggested that a simple webpage is created that links to the various sites and gives an outline.\n\n<strong>Key word: Autonomy. Program grabs all tags that autonomy is linked with. It\u2019s linked with a lot of key words.</strong>\n\nHigh score tags that link with \u2018autonomy\u2019. You can access into the original content and posts.\n\nThe tags are made by an ethnographer. We access the whole conversation at once.\n\n<img alt=\"Screen Shot 2017-07-12 at 17.29.43.png\" height=\"377\" src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/66e57fcf0d4b47eb15231e09227f5b333ef022fb\" width=\"624\">\n\nHow autonomy connects with strongest connection. An association made by the conversation itself. You can read the comments and posts so you can figure out why people think these two things are connected. When someone comments on a post, chances are they will make similar comments and be tagged with the same label/s. However they will often bring something new into the conversation that will create association with new tags.\n\nThe innovation is related to the thread and it denotes new tags/elements brought to the conversation\u2026 indication of how much the thread/discussion added to the conversation. If the number is high it means many new concepts were brought into the conversation. Amelia: we haven't properly tested the innovation theory - so it's not to say that higher \"innovation\" = more interesting, it was an idea we had. So don't assume posts with lower innovation tag aren't interesting :)\n\n<img height=\"320\" src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9fb25e1e8a7d00c2d9292d921454f496512e9130\" width=\"483\"><img height=\"294\" src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/bddd6cba6f53441a4b2b22149760fe2e1f33e686\" width=\"348\">\n\n<strong>We're looking for views of community members as to how to use it. Post on the platform and ping \u2026. Guy (@melancon) or Jason (@Jason_Vallet ).</strong>\n\nAmelia: now we have the link we can experiment on our own and then come back and discuss further on the next call\n\nDetangler view - people on the left and tags on the right. Use the example such as Alberto\u2019s post some time ago that follows how a policy maker might use Graphryder as a tool.\n\n<img height=\"293\" src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/301f888d0dcb2c594f0fb57c97689d040f2f40de\" width=\"624\">\n\n<img alt=\"Screen Shot 2017-07-12 at 17.39.45.png\" height=\"300\" src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f077029b19b816025461ca0dbe371ded786b21e2\" width=\"503\">\n\nAmelia and Jason will do a session at OpenVillage.

Racism against black people is endemic in the USA. Police brutality against black people is specifically a huge problem -- the formal police force in the United States has its origin in slave patrols, so the history of brutality goes back a long way. \n\nI'm writing because the support and involvement of the international community could go a long way to making sure this moment leads to larger institutional change in the United States. \n\nRight now, there are a few things we need. [This Black Lives Matter site](https://blacklivesmatters.carrd.co/?fbclid=IwAR0TDqsMV0rBZr0d1L1ez3F6fpu42L5t8v9qgIat9YZbmB_BElnzH-Oo3Zo#international) straightforwardly lets you directly donate toward any of the broad areas where help is needed.\n\n1. National Bail Out ([link here](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/freeblackmamas2020)): also known as #freeblackmamas. The criminal justice system in the US discriminates against and incarcerates black people en masse. Contributing to bail funds directly helps release incarcerated black people. You can also contribute to the [bail funds](https://blacklivesmatters.carrd.co/?fbclid=IwAR0TDqsMV0rBZr0d1L1ez3F6fpu42L5t8v9qgIat9YZbmB_BElnzH-Oo3Zo#intbail) to release protestors. \n\n2. [Reclaim the Block](https://secure.everyaction.com/zae4prEeKESHBy0MKXTIcQ2) is an organization created to dismantle, defund and divest from police presence in the city. It invests in \"violence prevention, housing, resources for youth, emergency mental health response teams, and solutions to the opioid crisis - not more police.\" If you want to contribute to divestment from these police forces and investment in other community-based forms of aid, this is a good org to donate to. MPD150.com gives more information about what a police-free community could look like. You can also [donate directly to families of victims of police brutality](https://blacklivesmatters.carrd.co/?fbclid=IwAR0TDqsMV0rBZr0d1L1ez3F6fpu42L5t8v9qgIat9YZbmB_BElnzH-Oo3Zo#victims). \n\n3. [Black Visions Collective](https://www.blackvisionsmn.org/) is doing a lot of work on the ground to get supplies to people in the field who are protesting and who have been displaced. You can [donate to them here.](https://secure.everyaction.com/4omQDAR0oUiUagTu0EG-Ig2) \n\n4. Supporting black-owned businesses that have been destroyed and other local efforts. This is a [twitter thread of black-owned businesses](https://twitter.com/hopewrlds/status/1266856971610632192?s=21) that need support. If you want to give directly to support particular people in local communities, consider looking through these [mutual aid funds](https://mutualaid.carrd.co/#networks) to find direct links to businesses, people rebuilding their communities, and other initiatives.\n\nLinks 2 and 3 are Minnesota-specific, because that's the context that I'm working in (and where this current movement originated). If you'd like to talk to me about the kinds of work you're interested in directly supporting, I can also connect you to local activists. For example, there is a group that has created something called the Sanctuary in Minneapolis --- taking over a Sheraton Hotel in the city to house displaced people, and provide people with food, clothes, and safety. They are taking direct donations via Paypal at fist0004@umn.edu. \n\nCurrently, I am also engaged in 3 efforts. First, pressuring corporations to match employee donations to the above and donating themselves. Second, pushing local organizations to cancel their contracts with the police (Minneapolis Public Schools have now cancelled their 1.1 million dollar contract. So has the Minneapolis Parks Board. As has 2 large Minneapolis museums, the MIA and the Walker). Finally, creating and disseminating a document for departments to sign that promise a set of concrete institutional changes to combat anti-Blackness and increase commitments to social justice in academia. If you're interested in getting involved in any of these, please feel free to reach out. \n\nIf you can't do any of the above, please consider boosting the voices of those in the movement who are sharing information and resources on social media to express solidarity and support  -- twitter and instagram in particular. Please do not post empty black squares on instagram because it is flooding feeds and inhibiting information access and resource sharing. Unless you want to troll the alt-right and white supremacists, in which case go ahead and post empty black squares using their hashtags. Contact me if you have questions about where to start. We can also engage in more global conversations on how colorism and anti-Blackness opresss people and hinder liberation movements everywhere. \n\nHere is another document a friend has put together about [workplace-specific action](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pXxzbdvdcIwiTtUgv6v-PoyOQ1vl5HUaWyewOKXTBqw/edit?usp=sharing) we can take. \n\n@CCS and @Leonie are also participating in this movement and can provide their own insights into ways to contribute and support. \n\nThanks for listening!", "created_at": "2020-06-04 13:08:21.994705", "updated_at": "2020-06-04 15:21:15.888001", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 797, "wiki": false, "reads": 20, "score": 499.0, "like_count": 9, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4934, 5059, 4, 2915, 5209, 4022, 5967, 6146, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33754, "user_id": 3597, "topic_id": 6603, "post_number": 1, "raw": "## Content\n\n1. **user journey experience**\n\n2. **interviews: preparation and interviews**\n\n3. **prototyping**\n\n------\n\n\n## CASE 1 - What happens today in restaurants\n\n**Users:**\n\n* Customer with food allergies\n* Other customers\n* Waiters\n* Kitchen staff\n\n**Moments analyzed:**\n\n* Arrival at the restaurant\n* Customers sitting at their table\n* Taking the order\n* Writing the order for the kitchen\n\n**Observations:**\n\nWhen the waiter collects the order and writes it down for the kitchen, a series of information are transmitted:\n\n* Costumer\u2019s state of health\n* **ingredients** that are present in the food\n* How the **dishes are prepared**\n* The waiter that is not prepared on the menu has to **ask information** to the **kitchen staff**\n\nThe waiter who is not aware of the ingredients in the dishes, who does not know how to advise customers with food allergies and who has repeatedly to ask information to the kitchen, produces a delay in the taking the order.\n\nAll customers who eat at the same table undergo the same delay.\n\n\n## CASE 2 - At the restaurant with \u201cAllego K\u00ec\u201d\n\n**All users know  \u201cAllego K\u00ec\u201d**\n\n* Customer with food allergie\n* Other customers\n* Waiters\n* Kitchen staff\n\n**Moments analyzed:**\n\n* Booking through **\u201cAllego K\u00ec\u201d app**\n* Arrival at the restaurant\n* Customers sitting at their table\n* Taking the order\n* Writing the order for the kitchen\n* Table service\n\n**Observations:**\n\n**\u201cAllego K\u00ec\u201d** for the restaurateurs comes in a kit containing:\n\n* Guidelines for the menu\n* Table allergies indicator\n* A smart guide for coaching the restaurant staff\n* Personalized order book\n* Restaurant\u2019s business cards for customers who do not know **\u201cAllego K\u00ec\u201d** project.\n* Food safety manual\n\nWith these tools, the restaurateur is able to train the staff and **reduce pre-order times and also replace all the information** orally transmitted between client and waiter **by a visual code (icons)**.\n\nAt the same time the customer with food allergies is able to indicate, thanks to the device, **his allergies** and show his **position at the table**.\n\nThe waiter at this point can use the personalized order book to write down where the allergic person is seated, what type of allergies he has and pass all the information to the kitchen.

To do this, the Lab facilitates collaborations between science fiction authors and readers (good at world building) and academic economists (good at reality checks). Its ultimate goal is to reintroduce blue-sky thinking into mainstream economics, involving academics, business leaders, politicians and writers and other artists in conceiving how  greener, fairer, happier human societies could function in *radically different ways from the status quo*, and how to get there from here.\n\nWe call for economists, social scientists, science fiction writers of any age and experience level to participate in an invitation-only seminar to be held in Brussels, in **venuename** on November 12th 2019. The purpose of the seminar is to produce abstracts for one or (more likely) more papers or works of speculative fiction (for example, sci-fi short stories set against the backdrop of speculative economies), that co-authors will work towards in the coming months. The Lab will facilitate the matching between co-authors with similar interests and complementary strengths, and seek publication outlets for the papers/works of speculative fiction. \n\nTo apply, send an email to **[create an address here]** by October 25th, with a short letter of motivation.

If you have any advice for an effective interview, please add to the bullet points below.*\n\n## 1. Interview Format\n\n* upt to Max 60 minute minute audio recordings plus interview transcript\n* In each, asking the same set of questions.\n* Each audio should also contain an additional 5-10 minutes free form conversation led by the interviewee.\n\n## 2. Guide to achieving a good interview\n\nIn order to achieve the best outcome from an interviewee it\u2019s important to familiarise yourself with the work of the person you\u2019re interviewing before hand, at very least read the about section on their website.\n\n1. Spend 5-15 minutes at least talking with the person you\u2019re going to interview before the interview starts, so you\u2019re comfortable with one another and they can respond in a relaxed way on camera.\n2. It is essential to have a clean recording of the voice with minimum background noise. (@johncoate can you give some technical advice for how to do with well when doing video chat interviews/remote interviews?) \n3. Make sure they\u2019re aware that the audio and transcript is going to be put online and shared within the Edgeryders network and further afield, so that they know the scope of their audience in advance, (fairly specialised but with the desire to share further).\n4. Give them a sense of the questions you\u2019re going to be asking before hand so they can think ahead - but also familiarise them with the intended output of the video so they can be conscious of it when responding to the questions (this will make editing easier later). Explain that specifically for these videos we intend to chop up some of the footage as well as producing a standalone video of them - we plan to create a combination video of individuals responding to the question \u201cWhat does the concept of Stewardship mean to you?\u201d\n5. Upon asking the initial question \u201cTell me about your project and work\u201d, if they stop short use the other questions \u201cHow did you get started\u201d, \u201cWhat are the core objectives\u201d to bulk out the response, hopefully though individuals will understand the need to give a good 2-3 minute overview of their work.\n6. Allow 5 second breaks between questions, continued conversation makes it difficult to edit later.\n7. Try to phrase your questions in a way that the interviewee needs to include the context in their response, which will make it much more useful when editing. i.e. the question \u201cWhy did you choose radioactive monkeys as a subject for your experiments?\u201d might elicit the response \u201cbecause I like the way they glow\u201d which is not a very informative sentence without the context of the question. However, this question is better: \u201cI\u2019d like to know what led to you working with radioactive monkeys - can you tell me about some of the reasons behind this decision?\u201d Here the interviewee cannot begin their sentence with a \u2018because\u2019 and they\u2019re less likely to use a pronoun to talk about the monkeys, because I mentioned them too far back in my question.\n\n## 3. Interview questions\n\nThe standard questions:\n\n* Tell me about your project/work?\n* How you got started.\n* Who\u2019s involved.\n* What your main objectives are.\n* What does the concept of (..Add topic relevant to their work/the event here) mean to you?\n* What do you believe are the most important projects internationally that related to ( topic relevant to their work and the context/event ) a in this moment?\n\nPotential additional questions:\n\n* What question did I not ask that you think is important and you\u2019d like to respond to?\n* What do you think will be the greatest challenge for the human race over the next 100 years?\n* Who is responsible for the future?\n* What does (key big theme we are exploring) mean in this moment?\n* What are the fundamental lessons from the past that we can learn from now?\n* What is an example of a heroic act in this moment?\n\n\n<hr>\n\n### Email template text for explaining the process and why it makes sense to do this:\n\nSubject: Following up on our exchange on (twitter, linked in , fb etc) re: interviewing you about (their topic/topic of session)\n\nDo you have time  at some point between now and november 1st for a remote interview, followed by a q&A in the form of responding to a few questions in comments from other participants ahead of the workshop in a moderated thread on our online forum?Realistically it would be something like 2.5 hrs in total.\n\nWhat we/I do is finding find people who are doing work we believe is important and have aligned values. Cut down the investment of time and effort for them to discover and understand one another's work.  To make it easy we do an in depth interview that is more in conversation form. Then transcribe and do a first edit into a skeleton post for the interviewee to edit till they are happy, and when they are ready they post it under their own name.\n\nThen our community managers draw the attention of others who have complimentary interests, needs, skills and or access to people who might: and the other way around. People read one another and post questions and answers through comments. Our community managers and research team reads/processes the conversations that develop, to find common ground between people having many separate conversations happening in parallel. We also have hired staff to scouting relevant opportunities to support people's work. These includes proposing joint applications to specific research grants or building financially viable projects to support long term work on issues. For methodology: [see here](http://academy.edgeryders.eu/) (ignore \"course fee\": community and activists have free access). \n\nWe have been doing this work since 2013. At present the community of people who are connecting this way on and offline is around 5000 people in +80 countries.

I met people from cultural organisations, artists, journalists & amp; watchdogs, programmers, people running to raise funds, people who are passionate about urban resilience and disaster management.\n\nIn introducing the evening, I highlighted the interactive ways in which the online platform can be used: (1) for Project Collection and connecting people and projects (2) as Workspace and coordination (3) Knowledge base: focus on documentation - not just the what, but how we do what we do, how we learn.\n\nI was surprised that I did not encounter the resistance I am used to: \"Who will come here to write when there's Facebook?\", \"The digital excludes many people\", \"The platform is not user friendly,\" and so on. Instead, I did notice a general shyness, a sense of decency that can be reticence, or..?\n\n## Collective trauma: Timisoara European Capital of Culture project\n\nThose who were at the meeting are not collectively aligned in how to deal with the tabu subject of Timisoara European Capital of Culture in 2021; they are deeply disappointed about how things (don't) happen in the association leading the implementation of the bid. Those who had been involved in the candidacy are still trying to overcome distress, and others are skeptical at a new mobilization effort - because it could fail? because it would mean turning their backs and letting politics win? Many subjects surrounding the bid have to do with political hijacking and control of resources, public money down the drain etc. I'm not clear yet. But what is obvious is that there is collective trauma and people need group therapy. May TeaM2021 help recovery, even symbolically.\n\nThe positioning of TeaM21 is as an \"independent and non-combatant\" project. That means if the roads of the two will cross, very well. There are still chances for collaboration. If not, at least people will have lived the experience of 2021 by capitalizing on the huge opportunity the city has. It is not too late to win, to nurture more civic and cultural activism, alongside healthy monitoring of what's going on with the City. It's not a zero-sum game: if we do X, we do not do Y, if X wins, Y loses.\n\n## How can Edgeryders be involved further?\n\nThis is a precious relationship for me personally, but also an opportunity for us to refine our work in a local-global setting. The breakthrough in our small collaboration so far has been that Edgeryders are service providers directly to a community of people embedded locally who want to activate online existing relationships. The jury is still out there as to how they are going to do it. \n\nConsultancy to build community is expensive, and with @Val.Muresan and @simona.fit we wish to learn from each other by running a project match-making program around relevant topics (ex: in community arts). This will be tied to and culminating in an event we do together - preferably at the launch of the Faber space where they will do industrial reconversion with other local creatives. I would like Edgeryders to be part of the launch (fall 2019 tbc). Can we do a (mini) festival there, and connect Timisoara folks with expertise from our network in the runup, to boost local activity? We would need to fundraise together, and quickly. \n\nAny thoughts? what would be good models for this? or any other ideas for how to make the most of it! \n\n_For the Romanian (adapted) version of this post [go to TeaM21](https://team2021.ro/t/reactii-la-team21-ro-terapie-de-grup-si-mersul-inainte/58) and meet the local community builders :-)._", "created_at": "2019-02-16 14:39:50.825699", "updated_at": "2019-02-16 14:41:47.206979", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 670, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 403.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 56193, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 10292, "post_number": 6, "raw": "Looks good, @RobvanKranenburg.

That scared me, seeing the future in them scared me, and on the other hand, there was Nadia talking about Edgeryders, and its team, and how they work, and their rejection to the actual system and how they work on creating a HEALTHY ecosystem... and I thought to mysel, that is exactly what I want to do! so I found myseld in the middle of two different way of thinkings, completely the opposite of each other, one is super scary, one is super beautiful, and what confused me is that me not being able to position myself in one of them, I thought, they are from Europe, they are not witnissing a severe economic crisis like the one we have now? so I can't relate much to that, but I can relate to those Tunisian youth working on things they hate just to make a living in this economic crisis... that was confusing for me, the thought is that I have no idea where I see myself in 3 years! \n\n2- I felt a sens of loss in most of the participants, it was comforting for me, to meet people who are confused about their future and what it holds, so you would hear them talk about their unability to decide what is stability for them, not knowing how to engage people in what they want to work on, their rejection of the focus on profit and not quality of the organization that are ran by different people, but not knowing what to do about that. \n\n3- I remembered this interview I had two months ago with a bank for a job, it is an Islamic bank, so when asking about what can we do in the marketing department, I was talking about how we should focus on the needs of the region, its youth, the unemployment, so we can organize events and so on for them in order to engage them with the bank ... so the guy was like, NO, We don't care about that, our marketing will only work on promoting that we are an ISLAMIC bank, we do HALAL business and people should be with us because we are closer to God's laws... no Haram business! that moment I  decided there is no way I can work with them! and yesterday I remembered it because I thought what if at some point I will have to work on things I don't believe in, in the first place! \n\n4- I hope that Edgeryders keep on being real, because asa Tunisian, we had so much international attention, that we no longer believe in the international movements organizations.. because they were serving their own interests, yesterday I felt proud of belonging to such a great community, that works in an honest way, so just keep on being real!", "created_at": "2017-10-01 09:35:57.424255", "updated_at": "2017-10-01 09:58:50.027485", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 611, "wiki": false, "reads": 26, "score": 245.2, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3729, 3769, 3, 4088, 1935, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 55327, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 10169, "post_number": 2, "raw": "I remember seeing some impressive data about allotments in the UK.

This is one of the reasons I am making the journey to Matera ... to see what there is for me to connect to and partake in beyond that which comes across through the online platform. I am very curious to see what my impression of EdgeRyders will be after spending time together in physical proximity.\n\nI would be happy to rephrase what you call non-rational to a more specific \"beyond rational\" (non-rational also leaves the door open to stupidity). I believe that one of the defining qualities of being on the edge is openness to that which we cannot (by definition) comprehend. My experience of EdgeRyders (mostly as an online space) has been that is leans towards intellect and rational ... which to me is limiting and can close the door on creativity.\n\nI believe the digital tools we choose to shape our online, collaborative community life AND the way we use them needs to respect that which is \"beyond rational\" ... or at the very least to be full-of-care not to overrun it. Writing these words has got me wondering if in choosing and designing our tools we should consciously introduce disruptive elements and not just tools that make everything smoother and easier (since smoother and easier may give an unhealthy boost to rational at the expense of beyond-rational).\n\nI personally place great value on the digital tools because my personal needs and life choices have reduced my access to physical proximity. I am where I work best, I do my best thinking while working physically outside ... but then I count on the help of online tools to connect with others and transform my thoughts into actions.\n\nI would like to see the qualities you mention extend into EdgeRyders beyond the once-a-year coming together. I don't know if/how this is possible.\n\nWill you be coming to the morning Yoga sessions? It is my intention to tap into a bubble of energy that has some of the qualities you describe ... and to offer an opportunity to reflect, share and communicate within that bubble of energy.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-10-17 14:47:39", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:48.163978", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 373, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [16035], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 34790, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 6668, "post_number": 13, "raw": "Yes it is, still hunting for the right ticket as they';re bloody expensive and mostly very long connections", "created_at": "2017-08-26 12:47:41.168614", "updated_at": "2017-08-26 12:47:41.168614", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 19, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 2.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [34779], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 78750, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 13700, "post_number": 36, "raw": "Fabulous coding meeting today!

It looks like the codes do in fact display in English if they have an English translation attached to them, so make sure that you assign the English translation to all codes in the backend. @SZdenek and @Jirka_Kocian, it's easy to see which ones don't have a translation attached, because they appear in Czech and not English when you open your coding page (like nedostatek vize below). \n\n![image|605x206](upload://3MKy16da0ySC1cwnF65yTRk8TFP.png) \n\nIf you open the code and click \"Add\", you can add the translation under \"Name\" and select \"English\" from the dropdown. \n\n![image|690x357](upload://1vY09GMdTvrwitsGmz1y2tItM29.png) \n\n2. In our own codebooks, we will create a tab in which we organise the codes roughly by categories (that we decide upon), making them easier to search by other team members. Do this as regularly as possible so the codebooks are more easily navigated. \n\n3. Wait to assign hierarchies / parent-child relations in the backend until we do this together as a batch after the SSNA visualisation, since our hierarchical relationships now affect each other. Do this as much as you want in your own codebook--- this is encouraged (see point 2) \n\n4. Do cleaning work as you code, specifically making sure to merge any codes that are the same across language fora (with permission of the original creator, unless the exact overlap is very self-evident).\n\n5. We are tracing an emergence of codes that are somewhere in between invivo codes and strictly descriptive codes. These are conceptual categories used by informants that differ from the way the same categories are used in the political science literature. For example, @Jirka_Kocian is finding that his informants are using the category 'communism' in specific ways, but ways that differ from the definition as used by political scientists. So we have decided upon the following naming framework:\n\n* Codes that are invivo should be in double quotes: \"witch\" or \"the East\"\n* Codes that are in between (conceptual categories used by informants), like the above, are in single quotes: 'communism' or 'patriotism'\n* Codes that are descriptive codes carry no quotation marks\n\nThis framework will help us understand meaningful differences between informant conceptual categories (in and across language fora) and academic literature conceptual categories -- and hopefully will let us start an analytical conversation with other partners, particularly the glossary deliverable. We will edit existing codes to fit this framework and move forward using it. \n\nHappy coding, all, and excited to see what the visualisation brings on the 1st!", "created_at": "2020-06-11 10:44:16.743995", "updated_at": "2020-06-11 10:44:54.684432", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 669, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 57.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [78743], "is_liked_by": [6484], "is_private": false}, {"id": 78322, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 13798, "post_number": 2, "raw": "It looks quite interesting.

But this extends further than static information.\u00a0What we have to offer is being creative about harnessing\u00a0peer support,\u00a0building\u00a0resources and collaborations to help one another live and work outside the empoyment paradigm.\u00a0\n\n<strong>Background</strong>\n\nThe idea for the unMonastery\u00a0came out of a conversation a small number of us\u00a0had at the last Living on the Edge event. What started out as a session\u00a0about alternative ways to fundraise for meaningful projects turned into a much deeper discussion. \u00a0At some point in the conversation\u00a0we realised that perhaps we were looking in the wrong direction.\n\n<span>We realised that perhaps the real question was not how we can find ways to chase money to support our experimental responses to economic, ecological and political crises. Rather the interesting question was h</span>ow could the people in that room,\u00a0experiment with new ways of living our own\u00a0individual lives together,\u00a0to support\u00a0one anothers work? And what kind of an infrastructure would we need to build to support these experiments? Assuming that we would never have access to public funding or commercial investment?\n\nThe unMonastery is the first of these experiments. Rather than decide everything in advance we just decided to go ahead collaborate in making\u00a0it happen, trusting ourselves and one another to be creative enough to\u00a0figure things out together along the way. Thanks to the\u00a0huge efforts of a small number of people with bursts of support\u00a0from many more people,\u00a0the unMonastery has\u00a0gone from idea to prototype in less than one year. \u00a0At some point along the way the public administration\u00a0of Matera, the City hosting the first prototype, got involved and offered \u00a0the space even putting money into renovating it.\u00a0But what kickstarted it was us just deciding to go ahead and realise it together.\n\nWe are documenting the work of making it happen here, but at some point in the process someone came up with the idea that we should synthesise this into a how-to guide\u00a0so others elsewhere could set up other unMonasteries where they are needed.\n\nAnd it got me thinking, In which\u00a0other new ways could we support one another to be able to do meaningful work while making a living? What questions could we ask and then flip into totally unexpected \u00a0solutions together? And could the challenge\u00a0of\u00a0collaboratively producing a practically useful and inspiring\u00a0book be a good context within which to coordinate our experiments and motivate us to document them for one another?\n\nIn two weeks, over 100 community members will be gathering at \\#lote3\u00a0at the unMonastery in Matera. The aim of the event is to help one another skill up and build capacity to get better and better at moving from talk to action in devising creative responses to economic, ecological and political crises.\n\nI am personally very interested in this question: How can those currently having a hard time in the labour market help each other to generate revenue and meaningful work through networks?\n\nSo my quest is\u00a0experimenting with <a href=\"/t/how-to-help-each-other-make-a-living-in-a-networked-society-maledge/1947\">new\u00a0ways \u00a0of generating revenue through self-organising\u00a0swarms and free floating collaborations</a>\u00a0now that <a href=\"/t/making-lote3/360/hire-yourself-using-edgeryders-as-a-corporate-shell-for-your-projects\">we have a\u00a0corporate shell we can use</a>.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>Want to help?</strong>\u00a0<strong>Ask a question you want to answer through the book!</strong>\n\n<span>Those of coordinating the collaborative production of this book\u00a0will use your questions \u00a0as a basis for structuring the book.

Inace sam iz Hrvatske, jako sam vezan i za Srbiju a poprilicno volim i Sloveniju :slight_smile:.\nOtisao sam u inostranstvo 2001 godine. Tad mi se cinilo da je kraj svijeta, a u neku ruku je i bio kraj mog svijeta. Ostavio sam iza moju prvu ljubav, prijatelje, dio porodice, PONOVO sam ostavio sve sto mi je bilo poznato...sve sto je cinilo moju komfort zonu. \nZbog rata sam bio prisiljen napustati komfort zonu puno puta, sto je u isto vrijeme lomilo moj duh i jacalo ga. Puno godina ranije sam se cesto uzivljavao u taj neki identitet zrtve, pun samosazaljenja i neke tuge za zauvijek izgubljenim. Danas u meni nema ni trunke samosazaljenja ni tuge za sebe samog. Rezultat tolikih promjena je bio to da je moja komfort zona u stvari van komfort zone, najbolje funkcionisem radeci stvari koje nisu po nikakvom standardu, kreativan sam i snalaznjiv. Cinjenica je da je sjecanje vezano za emociju, stoga najbolje lekcije koje imaju najvise uticaja su one popracene sa jakim emocijama. Sto se mene tice svrha ovog postojanja je da ucimo, razvijamo se i da stvaramo dobre medjuljudske odnose...da pomazemo jedni drugima i ucimo jedni od drugih.\nZbog tog razloga je ovaj projekat dobrobiti u Evropi jako zanimljiv za mene.\n\nPosao, zdravlje i duhovnost/moralnost su medjusobno povezani i nijedna stvar nije vaznija od druge...iako kad bi mogli birati uvijek bi stavili zdravlje na prvo mijesto naravno a o duhovnosti ljudi ne razmisljaju toliko ako nisu osigurali osnovnu egzistenciju :wink:.\nE zbog tog razloga sam ja posao stavio na prvo mjesto. Ne samo sto osigurava egzistenciju i oslobadja nas um da se bavimo i nekim drugim stvarima. Takodje je naucno je dokazano da je najvaznija stvar za zdravlje i razvoj ljudi sredina u kojoj se nalaze. S'obzirom da prosjecno provedemo 8-10 sati u poslu, izuzetno je vazno da nasa percepcija sredine u kojoj radimo bude vise u pozitivnom svijetlu. Ako nije, to je siguran put ka losem zdravlju. \nPoceo sam raditi sa 13 godina, prodavajuci sa tatom cigare na pijaci i od tada sam promijenio puno poslova...neke sam radio za druge a neke i za sebe. \nJa sam danas preduzetnik i konstantno balansiram izmedju rada za druge i rada za svoju firmu. Kad me pitaju 'cime se bavis', ja odgovaram:'stvarima koje volim' i to je realnost. Doduse to ne znaci da je sve cime se bavim ono sto ja volim. Moguce je i da biram da volim stvari kojima se bavim :wink:. \n\nTo znaci da sam jednostavno svijestan da (cak iako nekad ne radim ono sto bas volim) je sve moj izbor, prema tome stvarati u meni otpor prema necemu sto je bilo moj izbor nema smisla. Zato ja oberucke prihvatam sve sto dolazi sa poslom kojim se bavim u datom trenutku i ne trosim energiju na kukanje.\n\nNa primjer trenutno radim 'night audit' za jedan lanac hotela, posao koji mi donosi novce koje ulazem u moje projekte.\nRadim i na projektu dobrobit u Evropi, sto je za mene izuzetno zanimljiv projekat i totalno je sinhronizovan sa mojim vrednostima (zajednica, povezivanje ljudi, koristenje kolektivne inteligencije za poboljsanje kvaliteta zivota zajednice).\nTakodje imam firmu za pravljenje, izdavanje i sve ostalo vezano za drustvene igre i to mi je veliki uzitak, spojio sam moj hobi sa poslom.\nOd sljedece godine planiram zasaditi 10 hektara industrijske konoplje u Hrvatskoj i to poslje prosiriti na turizam.\nTakodje sam poceo u Hrvatskoj (totalno neprofitan) projekat. Kazem neprofitan zato sto ne donosi novac ali ne bi trebao reci neprofitan jer ce mi donijeti izuzetno zadovoljstvo i, najvazniju stvar na ovom svijetu, nova poznanstva. \nZelim pokrenuti skolu za programiranje i 3D modeliranje za klince. Programski jezici su jezici buducnosti a klinci u manjim sredinama uveliko kasne u odnosu na vece gradove, evo vam primjer informatike (crtanje microsoft worda) u Bosni :slight_smile:.\n![crtanje%20worda|690x387](upload://2NfYMEYrM0QNuKplqzIZ3OspsFg.png) \nMislim da ce im moderna skola u kojoj se uci uveliko kroz igru (a uce se prakticne stvari) poboljsati sanse za uspijeh u buducnosti i to je moja glavna motivacija.\n\nImao sam i par projekata u Srbiji ali nesigurnost zemlje, politika i poslovne prakse su me uveliko obeshrabrile...vidicemo sto ce biti u buducnosti.\n\nKao sto vidite, gdje god da sam ja uvijek jednim okom gledam na Balkan. Razlozi za to su jednostavni. Najljepsa sjecanja su mi sa Balkana (i najruznija isto ali od toga se sastoji zivot). Imam puno familije tu, prijatelja, nekih bivsih ljubavi :wink:...puno ljudi koje cijenim.\nTakodje, postoji kolektivna svijest naroda...po meni prenesena kroz gene, kroz zajednicku istoriju, iskustvo, kulturu, koja sigurno puno doprinosi.\nKakvo god da sam imao iskustvo u Zadru, osjecaj kad predjem Velebit je uvijek isti. Ono more, stijene, borova suma i smreke su dio mene i nepobitno me uvijek vuku kuci. \n\nVjerujem da je tako skoro svima. Lijepo je putovati, iskusiti nove stvari, upoznati nove ljude i razlicite kulture i prosiriti vidike. Ja cesto razmisljam o tome: koliko mi je ispravno sto sam ja u inostranstvu sad. Zasto nisam u Hrvatskoj ili Srbiji? Zasto ne radim na poboljsanju zivota tu, zasto se ne borim zajedno sa ostalim ljudima koje toliko volim? \nKompromis koji sam nasao a da mogu ostati srecan je taj da pomazem odavde gdje sam trenutno koliko mogu. Skupljam znanje i iskustvo koje cu danas-sutra moci primjeniti na Balkanu ili prosiriti dalje, takodje mijenjam svijest (nadam se na bolje) sto cu se isto potruditi prosiriti...kao valovi kad bacite kamencic u vodu.\n\nPrimjetio sam da se kroz moju pricu preplicu posao i duhovnost, eto to su dvije stvari koje izuzetno puno uticu na nase zdravlje.\n\nAko u mojim aktivnostima/prici vidite nesto od interesa ne ustrucavajte se. Odgovorite ovdje ili mi pisite. \n\nPeriodicno cu organizovati druzenja ili radionice u svrhu spajanja ljudi, izmjenjivanja iskustava i znanja i aktiviranja kolektivne inteligencije za rjesavanje stvarnih problema oko nas.\n\nNajljepsa stvar kad se nadje grupa ljudi na isto mjestu sto se mene tice je ljudski potencijal koji, kad smo u dobrom drustvu eksponencijalno raste u svakom od nas:\n\n![eksponencijalni%20rast|452x128](upload://9dqEts8mGWBlnML2aM3THfQrYBv.png) \n\nPrve ce biti u Beogradu i Beceju, sad 20og i 21og Septembra. Pisacu detalje ovdje na forumu za sve ljude koji zele podjeliti svoju pricu i doprinjeti poboljsanju kvaliteta zivota sebe i svoje zajednice.\n\nEvo za kraj slika jednog izuzetnog i pozitivnog iskustva sa Edgeryders festivala u Briselu.

The ethics of substantial freedom.

I connect it with Philip Agre and perhaps some of the philosophical frameworks developed in the EU FIDIS program around 2005. But I also recognise some huge public-administrative challenges in e.g. Sweden with changing the ownership structure for personal data/information in this way (i.e. information about private persons has been used to \"optimize\" public services, and must, in order to fill this role, belong to the government).\n\n> 2.

Under data protection law, however, it is the user of the data that unilaterally dictates the terms of usage to the holder of the right. Is either of these models envisaged or something different? For the air, surely it is the user of the air (a polluting industry, for instance) that dictates to the holder of the right to air (the population, perhaps?) the terms of usage. Somehow. \n\n> 4. Optimisation is not neutral. The choice to optimise at all has to be assessed based on its potential impact on the substantial freedoms of the individual.\n\n!!! Yes. There was a very good \"understreckare\" in Svenska dagbladet about this one and a half decade ago, or so, that questioned the concept of \"effectivization\".

At the same time, they are rushing into any subscription that promises \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d without reading or considering what they subscribe to in addition to what they intend. Without considering that they have to learn how to use a tool, not just which tool to use.*\n\n* How can we make people aware of/ teach the value of incompleteness?\n* People have to learn how to use a tool instead of what to use. No tool solves your problems, you solve your problems by using tools correctly and by completing them with your own abilities.\n* Be aware of the dangers of a subscription society that has no control over their lifelines\n* Open Source is made to be in control. It is not made for subscription models. What is the character of a subscriber? Discuss\n* \u2026Do we need to teach different things/values in schools? To teach people to be creators instead of subscribers? How?\n* What are digital/social conventions/behaviour norms people need to learn and how do we teach them?\n\n# Check in:\n\n**Alessandro:**\n\nEngineer from Italy now in Armenia is an entrepreneur developing topographic maps. Experience with tech startups.\n\nMotivation:\n\n* Wants to find alternative and new ways of doing things that are independent\n* Wants to find a way of making a living using/contribution/in open source/alternative approaches.\n\n#\n\n**Felix:**\n\nLives in a community in northern germany doing a lot of it stuff. Uses mostly open source software. He is an empowered user, able to use and contribute.\n\nMotivation:\n\nMixed. Big chances but also risks in acceleration.\n\nPoint for workshop:\n\n* Platform and content are two things. Having education in the hand of capitalistic run companies. It is very problematic to give up infrastructure and content off to commercial sources.\n\nExample:\n\nYoutube:\n\nEducontent, but you pay with advertisement and your information.\n\nOther examples: platforms from companies.\n\nThis has always been the case a bit, but it increases. Companies will make the content more addictive. Competition is interesting for quality, but if it is about education, it should be in public hands at all costs, not motivated by biggest profit.\n\n#\n\n**Allesandro:**\n\n* Beyond education. The livelines are so visible right now. So now we are all using so many services that are free, but essentially selling people's information. It would maybe be good to inform more in the general public about that even so many here already know that.\n\n#\n\n**Erik:**\n\nThere was a point in my life where open source did not matter for me. I came into it through a socialistic point of view, but I think an individualistic one would have been possible to. Many others certainly have not entered from a socialistic one.\n\nOpen source has very little to do with the economy.\n\nI came to learn that there is a different scale in our society which is more important right now:\n\nAuthoritarian vs freedom.\n\nIt is a scale that is far more relevant today.\n\nI am trying to compile that now into why I think it is so important what we talk about now.\n\nIt is a means of locking in knowledge. It matters to our society.\n\nBig companies centralise a lot of knowledge in terms of software, while not contributing in the same amount as they are profiting.\n\nIf you subscribe to knowledge, you are not a participant, but a consumer in society. If you forget of the left and right-wing perspective but rather focus on the authoritarian vs freedom scale.\n\n#\n\n**Maria:**\n\nThe scale of authoritarian vs freedom is also relevant in the corona response interventions.\n\n#\n\n**Erik:**\n\nYes, right now it is a big argument to move into the direction of tracking. China is quite far there already but the west is also moving there, maybe we are having other discussions, but it is moving in the same direction.\n\n#\n\n**Allesandro:**\n\n**If you want to be an empowered user, that is good, but many people do not aspiere to be empowered users, but rather want things to work, want to use things that work, such as dropbox. It works, I use it.**\n\n**Open source is often a community of makers, thinking about how they could make new things for makers. But that is not all the communities.**\n\n#\n\nErik:\n\nIf you approach popen source from a utilitarian perspective you could buy it. Therefore I think education is so important. The process itself, to learn something has important properties.\n\nWhat would we promote in school?\n\nShould we promote them to buy a well working tool or rather something they need to finish themselves.\n\nHow do we teach the \u201cvalue of incompleteness\u201d\n\nIf you teach students to just buy a product, you devalue the process.\n\n#\n\n**Felix:**\n\nPutting themselves in the imaginary company that provides this services to schools:\n\nThis company should include lessons for the teachers and pupils on how the things work (which you can only really show when using Open Source).\n\n#\n\n**Erik:**\n\nWhere do you draw the line? Which tool is the \u201cprimary value\u201d. I think the primary value is the process of learning. The results are secondary.\n\n#\n\n**Maria:**\n\nAnd what should teachers answer children when they ask: why should we learn this when we can just buy a program that does it?\n\n#\n\n**Erik:**\n\nWhy would you learn anything that you can learn on wikipedia? Again it is the learning process!\n\nWhat I tell my children: we have fun when learning. For example with countries. I think it is necessary to make the effort to learn even if they do not remember. Remembering the country's names and the \u201coutcomes\u201d are just a .\n\n#\n\n**Felix:**\n\nOne answer is: this way you can found your own company! You do not have to work for google, you can make your own google.\n\n#\n\n**Allesandro:**\n\nAre we talking just about tech education or all of it? For history it is not important to know the software the tool runs on but the background.\n\nIf I want to connect to my family I can use whatsapp or signal. If I don't care I will just use what app and it works, if I care I will maybe use signal.\n\n#\n\n**Erik:**\n\nIf you use your sources in history, how are you being critical towards your source. So the value of learning the process of learning and critical thinking is still relevant.\n\n#\n\n**Allesandro:**\n\nWe agree. But I think it is important to be clear that it is not just about it and being able to build your own software. It is relevant to other fields as well and we need to make this clear!\n\nPeople using things only see how good something works, not how transparent it is.\n\n#\n\n**Erik:**\n\nRight now people plunge into proprotory platforms to keep work and school running.\n\nThere will be a time to do that more after the crisis.\n\n#\n\n**General consensus:**\n\n*NOW: How to convene to different communities/fields?*\n\n*How can we find ways of communicating this to other communities and fields. Right now many people meet online that are not usually meeting. So I think we should push for this interdisciplinary conversation now.*\n\n#\n\n**Erik:**\n\nEvery community has its own challenges. Even Edgeryders as a very techy community does not have all types of online meeting platforms.\n\nMost communities are not primarily interested in the tech part, but into what they want to be doing. The danger in many communities is that they do not weigh in the dangers of not using open source.\n\n#\n\n**Allesandro:**\n\nThis is why I thought it so interesting when Matthias made this initiative to get people \u201coff google and amazon\u201d by offering alternatives. This way you could get people off while still functioning.\n\nI think this approach is relevant in this day and age.\n\n\u201cYou can have this and it costs you this\u201d or you can have this and it costs you your date> I found this approach very interesting. If you can go to a company and can bring them step by step into a new system you can explain it step by step while also keeping it running. Same with operating systems.\n\n#\n\n**Erik:**\n\nYou are touching on some very important points: It is easy to look at anything that you are doing and to find a tool that is doing it for you. Today we usually have subscription models. PEople sign up and it can get dangerous. It is awesome that it can be so easy, however, some of these subscriptions are doing things with you that you do not want to happen and it fosters the idea that subscriptions take care of things for you. Down the line things might happen. For examples: you are stuck with your dropbox, even if you can not pay for it anymore because you are dependent on it.\n\nWe need to speak about the meanings of entering into a subscription.\n\n#\n\n**Felix:**\n\nHere it could be good to explain different models to people. There are different models. In social media it seems to work with some alternatives where you can explain the upsides of using protocols not products (like email).\n\n#\n\n**Erik:**\n\nI gave this lecture in front of young people asking them which subscription I could just shut down X,Y,Z subscriptions. I Asked facebook, icloud, etc, including your bank account. They had not been aware that some of those things were subscriptions.\n\n#\n\n**Maria: SUB-ED, like SEX-ED, sex is good when done with informed consent and precaus=tions, same with subscription?**\n\n#\n\n## Webinar idea:\n\n# SUB-ED webinar.\n\n#\n\n**Felix:**\n\nExamples in the introduction: paypal, skype etc. one needs to make the research to show people who people are giving their information to.\n\nYou can jumpstart with something very practical.\n\n#\n\n**Erik:**\n\nTry to ask also: what if you were denied subscription? How would that effect you? You can not even perceive that that could happen.\n\n* What if you were denied a cell phone account\n* What if you were denied a bank account\n* What if\u2026\n\nWe can discuss china as a society who have gone quite far inthis development with their social credit system.\n\n#\n\n**Felix:**\n\nIt is a good example, but at the same time one needs to be very careful there. There are some very positive reports were people argue from the other side that it actually improves their lives.\n\nYou can disagree with that, but you can not deny their perspective.\n\n#\n\nErik:\n\nThis is where we come back to the scale of authoritarian vs freedom. It is not really about technology. It is about the context of how things are used. Even if the intentions are good, and I think we are headed in a similar direction, but I do not want to live in such a society. And that is why I think it has to be a discussion about values.\n\n#\n\n**Felix:**\n\nI agree that ist is absolutely relevant, but it is more far from the problem we now want to tackle. Therefore I would not put the chinar social credit example into that webinar topic/discussion at this point, even if we want to have that conversation in the long run.\n\n#\n\n**Felix:** list of paypal data connections: https://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/ua/third-parties-list Searching a visualization of that that I have seen a year or so ago, was a very nice graph showing the connections. Got it I think: https://rebecca-ricks.com/paypal-data/\n\n#\n\n## Wrapping up:\n\n**Maria: Next steps?**\n\n#\n\n**Allesandro:**\n\nIn regard to the webinar, if you leaf it to people to read the text it will not happen. THere is a tool I remembered that did something where it evaluated subscription agreements on if they are good for you or for the companies. (will add later)\n\n#\n\n*(general feedback by all and discussion, including the question if to focus on online webinars instead of in-person workshops for the time being (corona)))*\n\n#\n\n*These calls will take place now every Tuesday evening 18:00. They are on a regular basis. Maria will send out a reminder 2-1 days ahead. Nobody is required to come, it is an offer. We can use these calls for open conversations or develop something like the \u201cSubmission-education\u201d webinar as needed.*\n\n*Webinars like for a wider reach with more preparation will be announced 2-3 weeks ahead on top of that and prepared well ahead.*\n\n#\n\n## GOAL for now:\n\n# Develop a \u201csubmission education\u201d webinar in 3 weeks time.\n\n#\n\n**Chat:**\n\n> 18:15:28 Von Edgeryders Community : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D3lhMB0rkvW9_nbvhFGFyl65JdtkjvprLZob2vJMo-8/edit?usp=sharing\n> \n> 18:18:36 Von Erik : Elo\n> \n> 18:18:53 Von Edgeryders Community : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D3lhMB0rkvW9_nbvhFGFyl65JdtkjvprLZob2vJMo-8/edit?usp=sharing\n> \n> 18:20:27 Von FelixWSL : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D3lhMB0rkvW9_nbvhFGFyl65JdtkjvprLZob2vJMo-8/edit?usp=sharing\n> \n> 18:25:49 Von Edgeryders Community an Alessandro Mambelli(Privat) : thank you for your point allesandro.

The Econ-SF seminar should bring to bear considerably more intellectual firepower, and hopefully start to build connections between utopian SF and _existing_, or at least actually possible, economic institutions that might evolve into infrastructure for those economies. Remember, this is the narrative mechanism of SF anyway: I know that _Anathem_ is much cleverer than your average SF novel, but that contains a proposal for the design of a learning institution that does not build Everything Killers. It's done by cleverly combining elements of modern universities (the Unarian maths), medieval universities and monastic orders. You can imagine SF being written doing similar work on development banks, or the complex schemes Ostrom found in the research leading to _Governing the commons_.\n\nAs for Mazzucato, or any economist... she gets to do what economics should be all about; blue sky speculation about how to pursue the common good, with new intellectual stimuli in the form of sets of assumptions that SF writers make for them. \"Yes, but imagine we _don't_ focus on incentivizing people to overcome each other, and try instead to create abundance so there is no need for rationing... how would it work then?\". \n\n_The value of everything_ states clearly that societies need to decide what constitutes value. Except societies are not entities, they are emergent properties of the interactions across social agents. Economic institutions formed around specific groups of people with specific values and interests. Medieval banking families served the needs of merchants supplying high nobles with luxury goods found in distant lands, and, soon after, of kings in need of finance for their armies. The Washington consensus between the IMF, the World Bank and the US Treasury in the 1980s and 1990s represented the interest of international creditors, mostly Western banks holding bonds issued in developing countries. The infamous troika EC-IMF-BCE during the recent financial crisis represented the agenda of northern European countries. Can we imagine economic institutions that co-evolve with open source hackers and anarchists? \n\nThis should not be a hard sell.

Was tough and many people finally couldn't show up as well because it was done on such a short notice. I waited for third party input for 4 days, I never received it but it delayed the meetup organisation for that long so it hampered me a lot.\nMy take on those 3 busy days:\nDay 1 in Belgrade: only 5 people but a great core group I feel. I talked about Edgeryders and Wellbeing in Europe, they introduced themselves and what is it they care about really. Then we brainstormed about various ways in which we could improve the quality of life. Some very interesting proposals were made. I think the Belgrade part of festival is quite feasible.\nDay 2 in Becej: very disappointing for me because a lot of people said they will come. Spoke with only 3 people but out of 3 all were great really. All three had successful stories so I really hope they post them here as examples how things can be done when you want it and work hard for it. \n\nOne has an interesting story, is a member of Serbian inventors association, has a great set of skills and is full of ideas. He proposed I do a meetup with the Serbian inventors association and that would be great.\n\nThe other is a triathlon pro, 1st place on many competitions and quite entrepreneurial.\n\nThird one started brewing kraft beers in his cellar, now he opened quite a nice pub where he sells his beer too...and he built almost everything in his pub. He also will connect me with his sister, who works in high school and is an activist. She often does educative workshops for kids and parents etc.\nTurns out a friend of mine worked 4 yeas in gymnasium there (I wasn't aware) so that will be of great help if we are to involve 17 and 18 year olds in doing a workshop in Becej during the Wellbeing festival.\n\nIn Novi Sad I did an event for something else I am working on but I used the opportunity to talk about Edgeryders as well. Top people there would be a young very entrepreneurial couple and a social entrepreneur who created https://bankavremena.org.rs/ . Timebank is another try at creating an economy based on direct exchange of services. knowledge etc. He also does workshops on entrepreneurship, startups etc.\nHopefully with them we can do something interesting in Novi Sad.\n\nI didn't have time for testing my approach of interviewing people on the river banks.

I have been working simultaneously in the sector of film industry as an artistic director, composing and performing musical soundtracks for both movies and documentaries.\n\n\nMay you know that projects of high quality cannot be realized without a solid and deep training and coaching, this is why in December 2015 I decided to launch The High Academy of Arts :the first center dedicated to Tunisian talents that provides professional art classes for youth and adults helping them to follow their passion. \n\nOur academy offers a high-quality education in various artistic fields that are increasingly interrelated in our society, including music, dance, theater, audiovisual technology, graphic design, photography and performing arts.\n\nThe Academy is not only one of the country\u2019s leading institutions for the development of an amateur practice of arts, but also a place that gathers young talents , experimented arts teachers and art flowers.  \n\nThe main issue that our community of artists are facing in my country is the lack of a recognized certification in the various artistic disciplines. The existing structures \u2013 mainly private conservatoires and academies \u2013 are indeed not habilitated to deliver such diplomas. It is against this background that emerged the idea to establish the High Academy Of Arts: a center for professional training entitled to deliver recognized certifications in the artistic field. Our institution thus aims at filling a crucial need in this professional sector in Tunisia.\n\nThe Academy\u2019s education project\n\nSoon after its creation the Academy demonstrated the quality of its education. For two successive years (2016 & 2017), four of its minor students obtained the Artistic Professional Card \u2013 delivered by the Tunisian Ministry of Culture \u2013 as well as all its adult students who ran for the national examination.\n\nThe Academy indeed puts significant efforts in to provide a good quality of training for its students : combining individual courses, with group workshops, organizing study trips and online classes provided by international professors. This comprehensive curriculum aims, on one hand to ensure the diversity of the education received by the students, on the other hand, to boost their intellectual curiosity and cultural open-mindedness \nWe especially take care of our senior students and we support them during their graduation projects, which are mandatory to obtain their diploma.\nOur greatest challenge is to deliver a serious and high-quality artistic projects realized by our students individually or in a team. \nWe also consider essential, that the projects delivered can compete in the national and international industry \n\nThe E-CULTURA Social Project:\n\nThe centralization of artistic education and cultural activities remain a concerning issue in today\u2019s Tunisia. Acting to reduce the regional unbalance in the cultural field is at the heart of our mission in  the Academy\u2019s E-CULTURA project.\n\nOur first goal  is sharing the Academy\u2019s rich and high-quality art courses  with the most deprived regions in Tunisia. Through a mobile application developed by young Tunisian engineers, the Academy have the ambition to provide a free access to its courses to the youth of the marginalized regions. A first phase of the project will initially cover six governorates identified as most in need of cultural education (Kebili, Kasserine, Sidi Bouzid, Kef, Siliana and Jendouba), so the locals of this regions will attend online our courses and workshops .\nBesides, the project aims to spread the values of culture and make a larger impact in this regions giving the opportunity to the locals to attend several cultural events taking place in Tunis and organized by our partner organizations \u2013 including national institutions as well as foreign cultural centers \u2013through free live broadcasting.\n\nThe technology we use :\n\nThe e cultura student : An original pedagogical design to facilitate the relationship between the teacher and the class in the presence of a diffusion camera we have developed a dummy integrated by a touch pad on the back and a camera in front to make the relationship between classmates And the Professor more intimate fluid and warm, which guarantees the smooth operation of the course and its transmission.", "created_at": "2017-08-22 15:12:43.079463", "updated_at": "2017-09-05 17:14:29.257846", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 718, "wiki": false, "reads": 26, "score": 505.2, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1935, 3729, 2915, 3782], "is_private": false}, {"id": 63806, "user_id": 5551, "topic_id": 11492, "post_number": 3, "raw": "[quote=\"manuelpueyo, post:1, topic:11492\"]\nQuelle est ton nom?\n[/quote]\n\n@manuelpueyo - Je croix que \u00e7a devra \u00e9tre Ou habites-tu? pas Quelle est ton nom.", "created_at": "2019-11-11 19:51:47.511805", "updated_at": "2019-11-11 19:51:47.511805", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 26, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 36.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [63786], "is_reply_to": [63786, 63791], "is_liked_by": [2536, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 71197, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 12816, "post_number": 4, "raw": "My opinion: try not getting caught up in the details too much.

With that I mean that there are a lot of other people who feel similar. And having a dream that doesn't mesh with your current reality is completely ok.\n\nTalking from my own perspective here, this is the advice I can give:\n\n1. Don't put yourself down. The fact that you do try to realise your vision puts you ahead of the curve, even if nothing will come from it. You are not a looser.\n2. Look for allies. Of course your idea is bigger than your skillset, of course you need skills, resources and contacts that you don't have yet. That is normal. So start talking to others about your idea, and invite other peoples input and help.\n3. Embrace failures and delays. Most projects fail. That is normal. But having done the work can be still rewarding, you will have made new contacts and friends, you will have learned things. Maybe the work on the project will lead to another project, one that actually turns out great.\n\nThat was the motivational speech. Now to specific hints: Look for groups of people who work in the same field of your vision. Go to conferences, meetups, online hangouts where they gather and talk to them. Get your idea out there and ask for feedback. People might not immediately throw money at you, but you can gather a team. Look for people who have what you don't have in terms of skills and convince those first.\n\nThen the rest will probably sort itself out, one way or the other.", "created_at": "2019-10-22 12:28:28.343953", "updated_at": "2019-10-22 12:28:28.343953", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 272, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 67.4, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4934, 5400, 1856, 2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 67111, "user_id": 2346, "topic_id": 11869, "post_number": 4, "raw": "[quote=\"LinneaPC, post:1, topic:11869\"]\n**When did something related to the internet last make you hopefull or happy?**\n\nAt the moment I am just looking at the really bad examples, I am here, at Internetdagarna today to find good examples. Currently, we see a lot of bad examples.\n[/quote]\n\nI have a perhaps helpful reflection that I know I am not the first to have made:\n\nDigitalization and computer systems lend themselves to centralized decisions, and this was the most aggressive charge leveraged against computerization in the 1960s and 1970s. The Skolverket might, for instance, decide to create an application service for high school for 14 year olds to facilitate the administration of applications under the fria skolval. However, what ends up happening is that parents and kids turn to teachers with questions about the interface and application process, in spite of teachers being far away both from the process of designing the interface and not being responsible for the application process either. \n\nSo while for Skolverket the centralized system for applications under the fria skolval is indeed a time-saver that enables efficiency, for the individual teachers it becomes a time-hog since they have to spend time explaining to individual students/parents systems that they are not well-placed to understand or explain. It sub-optimizes by creating an easily measurable \"central\" advantage that translates into a more difficult to measure \"decentral\" disadvantage (see also @nadia 's 4th principle here: https://edgeryders.eu/t/5-new-principles-for-justice-in-the-age-of-ai-and-other-networked-technologies/12117/3 )\n\nI think there has been research on this at Link\u00f6ping university, by Elin Wihlborg: https://liu.se/en/employee/eliwi01", "created_at": "2019-12-06 18:20:31.848556", "updated_at": "2019-12-06 18:20:31.848556", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 283, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 41.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [65602], "is_reply_to": [65602], "is_liked_by": [4934, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10864, "user_id": 33, "topic_id": 1345, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Personalized applicability</b>\n\n\u00a0\n\nHi Noemi,\n\nThank you for a warm welcome! I\u2019m honored to be a small part of such an amazing community and I\u2019ll do my best to dedicate more time to this project!\n\nWell, to answer your first question, I\u2019m not suggesting the order should be inversed and that the whole school system should be reformed and introduce first practice and then theory. I\u2019m saying that worked very well for me personally. If I had had the theory first and the internship later, I would have forgotten half the theory before I started work, and I wouldn\u2019t have been able to put it to good use. But the theory should be taught in relation to some form of applicability. In college, most students have a part-time job. So subjects as organizational theory could be taught more efficiently if they related directly to the student\u2019s personal experiences within the work market. Bottom line: teach students theory but touch upon their personal experiences so they can internalize and apply the theory.\n\n1) Regarding Techno Fashion, for starters, I would recommend Bradley Quinn\u2019s book \u201cTechno Fashion.\u201d You can browse through it in Google books to get an idea of what it is. And as for my thesis, I\u2019ll make sure to send you a copy when I hand it in :D\n\n2) Your second question: \"What is this PaEI model you couldn't consciously use back in Berlin, but intuitively did so? What does it mean?\"\n\nThe PaEI model was made by Ichak Adizes, formerly a professor from the John E. Anderson Graduate School of Management at UCLA. The Adizes Methodology is a set of practices and procedures for optimizing organizational function on an ongoing basis. He takes a holistic approach that includes both collective and individual management styles, abilities, behaviors, values and aspirations.\n\nAdizes has a theory on organizational lifecycle dynamics where he describes 10 cycles an organization goes through, just like a human being would. Check more on Adizes out here: <a href=\"http://paei.wikidot.com/adizes-methodology\">http://paei.wikidot.com/adizes-methodology</a> (life cycles are three quarters down the webpage)\n\nI didn\u2019t use the PaEI instinctively. I didn\u2019t use it at all while in Berlin because I didn\u2019t know about it. But I could have used it efficiently if I had known it.\n\nIt would have been very helpful for me to be able to place my employer\u2019s business within Adize\u2019s model and put it into context. The model serves to pinpoint problem areas in an organization so once you\u2019ve put your finger on what\u2019s wrong, you can counteract that. In this case the problem was that the organization was still in the Go-Go stage (combined with tendencies from Adolescence and the Infancy stage), which means that its attention was dissipated, they had too many priorities at once and they weren\u2019t that good at collaborating with others. E.g. I would get an instruction to do a certain task, but within 5 minutes, my employers and my co-intern would be gathered around my computer trying to solve the same task. Just like a toddler that gets a hold of a toy and doesn\u2019t want to let loose, my employers delegated assignments without being able to completely let go and let me do my job. This wasn\u2019t so much lack of trust in me, it was mainly their lack of ability to work with others, and their need to control everything \u2013 which Adizes calls the \u201cFounder\u2019s Trap\u201d.\n\n3) I don\u2019t know how spread the model of coupling theory with practical experience really is. I took my Bachelors at another institution here, at \u00c5rhus School of Business(ASB). And all the exchange students I\u2019ve met there were told me they chose ASB because it is so renowned across Europe for being one of the best schools to offer the perfect balance between theory and practice. Well that really wasn\u2019t the case for most of those students, and it wasn\u2019t the case for me either. I thought much of the theory we were taught was presented in a really dry, insipid manner that didn\u2019t help me process and internalize it so that I could hang on to it long enough to apply it later. And out of all the educations possible I\u2019d imagined that studying what I study now, aesthetics, a branch of philosophy would just propel me into a world of ideology that is completely divorced from reality. But that isn\u2019t the case. Mostly because \u00c5rhus University has restructured a lot throughout the past decade and has perfected its mastery of combining practice with theory.\n\nAnd what you said about Romania is true. Unfortunately the school system doesn\u2019t encourage and support hands-on experience and the theory is detached from actual reality. It\u2019s a very outdated and rigid school system which we copied from the German tradition, but later failed to re-copy so that we could go along with the developments as well. It\u2019s an advanced oppressive machinery that intends to spit out mere robots. But I am confident that this will change. Being a Romanian myself, I definitely had some difficulty adjusting to the Danish school system because I was a whetstone grinder (tocilar) but had no ability to think for myself. So I kept looking for a rigid pattern to lean up to because I felt completely lost without them. In some courses we didn\u2019t even had books, our course material was comprised of hundreds of different news paper articles, excerpts from different books, essays, blogs etc. That was really confusing.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-03-20 17:25:17", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:02.684369", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 995, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 72773, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 12164, "post_number": 236, "raw": "Yesterday we tired out @HadeerGhareeb game \"didiasks\" in  a video call.

I think the media format itself encompasses the entire process that starts with posting on the platform, sharing ideas to solutions, moving these forward and then the work the technology does: linking ideas, people etc to each through ethnography, how that connects people to ideas, resources etc and often ends with an outcome or something actionable ( that happens offline). \n\nIt's an interactive format and maybe 'media' was the wrong one to use for it. My initial task was to think of a new word to explain it. \"Podcast\" or \"livestream\" were given as examples. Reading into that these are mediums that have existed in the past (radio packages, audio casettes, cd and live television programmes) that have evolved as they adapt to an online environment. These are very much 'media' - do you think format or process better describes what EdgeRyders does?\n\n2. I think the main difference to other forums you have described is the underlying technology. I find it really interesting that conversations are analysed on lines of ethnography. Where other forums depend solely on tags and language processing to caegorise, two people on EdgeRyders may be speaking about two subjects or processes that are very similar but use different language and still a connection will be made. \n\n3. Yes exactly people will refer to the process as anarres. So, like saying \"I listened to a really interesting podcast yesterday on...\" someone could say \"We learned some interesting things from an aanarres on permaculture.\"\n\nDoes that answer/explain what you asked? Do you have any ideas on how you think it could work within everyday conversation? \n\nI think your questions have helped me understand that what EdgeRyders does is more about a process than a final product such as a \"podcast\". Do all EdgeRyders' processes result in something final or is it something that's openended and changing? (which is originally why I chose anarres)", "created_at": "2020-06-12 08:30:54.236533", "updated_at": "2020-06-12 08:30:54.236533", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 326, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 36.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 79410, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 13851, "post_number": 7, "raw": "[quote=\"lroddy, post:5, topic:13851\"]\nYes exactly people will refer to the process as anarres.\n[/quote]\n\n\nDo we have the cultural traction to get people to introduce new words into their vocabulary?", "created_at": "2020-06-23 10:42:43.982396", "updated_at": "2020-06-23 10:42:43.982396", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 33, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 11.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [78830], "is_reply_to": [78830], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 63752, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 11454, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Hello Ahmad and welcome to Edgeryders.\n\nIt's an interesting idea you have.

In the standard 15 minute doctor visit it hard to dig deep and get these answers.\n\nIt all began with three words. \"You have cancer.\"\nThe most dreadful words anyone can hear. Denise Sliepen and Carry Hendrix heard those words.\n\nWhen Denise was diagnosed with in 2015 she had support from family and friends, but still found that they couldn't fully understand what she was going through. It was only by chance that Denise crossed paths with Carry Hendrix who was going through a similar diagnosis. An interaction at the gym brought these women to share the same space. Their friendship started and strengthened, and from that bond, it eventually led them to an idea of starting CoreCareCollective. An initiative to support the emotional and social needs of people living with cancer. This initiative promises to create a network of support dedicated to ensuring all people impacted by cancer are empowered by knowledge, strengthened by action and sustained by community.\n\nTheir story was shared in the [SCimPulse Blog](http://www.scimpulse.org/search?q=cORecarecollective), and we know it\u2019s necessary to share the \u201cWhy\u201d behind the initiative. Their intent is to provide a tool to support a collaborative dialogue between patients for sharing experiences and offering support.   As these early conversations are the backbone of any project. I had the opportunity to speak with Denise over a coffee and she shared with me the motivation behind their initiative.\n\n\n  <img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c5338fd2970a6a0d32aba533e5345a8f45ce1f55.jpg\" width=\"459\" height=\"277\">\n\nA Recollection- I asked a few questions and this was the result of our conversation.\n\n\u201cAfter meeting Carry and getting to know one another and sharing the challenges and realizing they were similar including the internet for answers. We realized that information was scattered and more importantly we realized there must be others just like us. Searching for answers and support or exchange of conversation.\nIf something works for us, maybe it could help someone else who is in that unknown space. Sharing valuable information and treatment options are things that we would welcome. We thought we there must be others who were searching for answers as well. Nothing should be left up to chance. We decided that we wanted to help the next person who was affected and change the way people deal with cancer\u201d.\nI can recall an appointment at the hospital, where we were going to speak with a dietician for advice-which ended up not with insufficient information. We asked various questions, and shocked by the answers\u201d.\n\nWe both loved sports, maintained a healthy diet and wanted to retain as much of our daily lives as possible prior to diagnosis while undergoing treatment. So we went online and the journey began\u201d.\n\nWhat prompted the action?  \u201cWe wondered if all cancer patients struggled with the information provided on nutrition and exercise during treatment. We knew healthy eating and nutrition support can improve a patient's quality of life during cancer treatment. But we could not find a platform to discuss these issues, exchange experiences and see what works for someone else.  We all could learn from one another.  So we put our thoughts together and experiences so far and decided to start a community that could benefit from each other\u201d. \n\nWhat is the mission of CoreCareCollective? \u201cOur mission is to empower anyone who has been affected by cancer. To provide a space with the ability to connect and share personal experiences about cancer with others who understand. Our community would be 100% user-generated and engages all who are involved in a person\u2019s cancer fight: the survivors, fighters, supporters, and caregivers\u201d. \n\n\u201cEvery person who faces cancer has a story. This would be a space where the individual and collective voices impacted by cancer can be heard and shared to meet the social and emotional needs of patients, families, and caregivers throughout their journey\u201d. \n\nI had asked who else would be in collaboration, this was her response, and \u201cThe platform will honour the individual experience and create a community of understanding that extends to the entire health care delivery system\u201d.  \n\nWho do you want to reach? \u201cPeople around the world that want to share their experiences and sharing their strength\u201d. \n \n \nDenise and Carry have the vision to improve how cancer patients receive care and to collaborate and create a cancer support community that empowers people to take control of life before, during and after treatment. This support is crucial in allowing survivors, fighters and caregivers to share experiences with foods, treatment, side effects, long term effects and more.\n\nIt is their hope that every person and family battling cancer will reach out to the many others who want to help and get connected to a community that cares. Sharing the stories each with a promising and innovative approach to reinvent healthcare.\n\nI should end on a note with the essence of transparency, Denise and Carry, two strong and powerful women had their lives turned upside down decided to take their time and focus on feeling well and take an active role in improving their well-being. They decided to take a step back to move forward, at their own pace. So at present CoreCareCollective is waiting to be birthed. There are a plethora of platforms available to cancer patients and their families. But not all are created equally or intended to serve the same purpose. Updates on this project will be shared as they develop.", "created_at": "2017-09-10 15:04:28.116545", "updated_at": "2017-10-05 16:34:21.863911", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 951, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 26.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 51305, "user_id": 4022, "topic_id": 9559, "post_number": 2, "raw": "[quote=\"richdecibels, post:1, topic:9559\"]\nSo first question: does anyone already have a legal entity, registered with the EC, that they\u2019d be happy for me to use as a subcontractor?

Then some of us find it an irrelevant hype. Yet as everything is being put on blockchains lately (especially in Berlin, where we also have Blockchain Yoga meetings and a conference on the topic every single month, not to mention dozens of meetups), I was thinking about starting a discussion that could possibly lead us to some interesting experiment.\n\nLast night I have attended a  meetup in Berlin, where a young couple from Brussels discussed their adventure with steemit and how they see the future of blockchain unfolding. Besides trying to earn cryptos, he works a developer and she runs a [small NGO](http://lesconseilsmoneydetati.be/) that trains young people to be entrepreneurial (understand money when they're older, when they're young - building their confidence). They've been also digging for quite a while in blockchain projects and now they also blog and teach about it. \n\nThe whole talk, which touched a lot of subjects as some of the participants came to showcase their own mastery of the blockchain world (gossips, dramas, new ICOs, breakups, billions of dollars in ether owned by the Steemit CEOs and potential tragic consequences of that for the ether market, and other very interesting things) made me think of a way in which edgeryders could potentially use the idea to solve a problem of community engagement. I've noticed we're using rewards lately - for using emoticons and getting likes. Why, instead, wouldn't we put the platform on a blockchain and design a system of rewards in an edge coin, that might actually work as real money? \n\nIt has commonalities with @Matthias, whose pay coupons have been polished and improved for years now. As he put the coupons on the blockchain lately, we will soon have a lot of interesting experience to discuss ;)\n\nThere are many things that have to be figured out:\n- who gets to decide which posts are awarded and how much?\n- how decentralized/ centralized should it be?\n- which technology is suitable to the needs of an online community? There is [STM](https://smt.steem.io/) in baking, which is designed for online communities and content creation, and it might be the right one for us to  try out\n- how could the token operate within and outside of edgeryders? How would it be valued and traded, for which kinds of transactions?\n\nI can imagine that it could, for example, simplify the process of verifying who earned the ticket to LOTE - we have a call for contribution in order to get the ticket, and we can award members with tokens for accomplishing certain tasks and see the balance at the end of the preparation. We could also use it to fund projects we're dreaming of, instead of applying for grants. And support collaborations on the platform. Or earn a night in our tiny house :smiley: \n\nFor starters, we could distribute first 40.000 or 80.000 tokens to members for all their contributions so far. Decide how new tokens would be created, how many we'd like to release if we could have an ICO for that in the future (For example for buying a property for a bigger Reef?). \n\nAlso, an interesting fact, this year a company in Germany will open 2000 crypto ATMs - if we have an ICO, these contributions could even more easily become cash withdrawals soon. \n\nI'm thinking out loud and I'm aware of the fact that I don't understand blockchain yet - but I'd welcome some of your opinions and ideas about it.", "created_at": "2018-04-10 14:47:21.898318", "updated_at": "2018-04-10 14:47:21.898318", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 604, "wiki": false, "reads": 32, "score": 206.4, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4357, 5, 4085, 4265, 4, 4448], "is_private": false}, {"id": 58529, "user_id": 5123, "topic_id": 10600, "post_number": 9, "raw": "Tak http://starabieda.edgeryders.eu zdecydowanie wygl\u0105da najlepiej :)", "created_at": "2019-08-28 14:08:51.743760", "updated_at": "2019-08-28 14:08:51.743760", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 8, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 21.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [58527], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 70854, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 12164, "post_number": 146, "raw": "Anyone feeling any symptoms?

During the pregnancy, Rosalie lost the frontal part of her brain. Thus she has difficulties to talk, but she understands everything. Rosi is a very attentive young girl. She has spasticity and sits in a wheelchair. The wheelchair supports her in an upright position.\u00a0\n\nRosalies parents told us, that there was no barrier-free playground when she was little. Her parents used to carry her out of the wheelchair so that she could play at the playground. Rosalies parents actually advocate this, since she was then given the opportunity to experience variety. She learned, felt and experienced things outside of her wheelchair. Apart from this, she didn't feel different from the other kids anymore.\u00a0\n\nThe family emphasized, that the variety and the new feeling a child gets when being or playing outside the wheelchair, is much more valuable than one might imagine.\u00a0But unfortunately there is no equipment, no seats, which supports the body and ensures children with paralysis or spasticity a comfortable seat, for example while swinging.\u00a0Her mother gave us the example of a beanbag chair. Thanks to its soft filling, the beanbag ensures a cozy seating and adapts to the body at once. The beanbag chair is body ergonomically.\n\nThe interview and the experiences the family has already made, gave us a whole new view of needs.\n\nAfter a little observation and a couple of statements, we narrowed it down to the main elements, which are most popular by children in different ages: sandbox, swing, slide.\u00a0We made sketches and gathered ideas of how each element could be inclusive. After adding the beanbag chair into our sketches, they led more and more into a swing.\n\nSo we minimized our target group into children at the age of 2 to 10 years, due to weight and hight.\n\nRight now, we have a few ideas and sketches for a swing, in which you can sit or lay down together as two. Already existing swings inspired us, like in the pictures below.\n\nThe strength of our concept is currently more on the inclusion than on accessibility. Our idea of the swing is more about togetherness and common experiences with children with and without disabilities.\n\nWe could not imagine before, that inclusion and accessibility are two different topics/areas. Looking at our first idea of the playground and the current one, our current one is not barrier-free. The swing can not be used with a wheelchair. However, the current swing gives children the opportunity to experience moments outside their wheelchair, in a suitable way.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-06-18 06:14:05", "updated_at": "2018-05-24 16:27:57.958135", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 464, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 25.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17993, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 4579, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>and</b>\n\nduring the call we mentioned that apparently in Ukraine it is relatively easy to talk to people/organizations compared to Belarus, Egypt and Armenia.

Nevertheless, I would like to comment on one of her points: that the pandemic, as it ravaged so many human lives and endeavors, has strengthened large tech companies.\n\n> The obvious big winner of the COVID-19 crisis so far has been Big Tech. Where most sectors of the economy have seen demand collapse, many large tech companies are reporting [record profits](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/04/30/first-real-recession-big-tech-era-double-edged-sword-silicon/), and have been able to use this momentum to further consolidate market share. With more of us reliant on technology for our daily lives than ever before, we have become more willing to turn a blind eye to the excesses and ethical shortcomings of these companies and their business models. The so-called \u201cend of the techlash\u201d would no doubt be seen as a welcome break after years of negative headlines and mounting public pressure. But will it turn out to be a temporary respite for the internet giants, or are we witnessing a more permanent concentration of power over yet more aspects of our society and economy?\n\nKatja formulates it as a question, but her article seems to have an answer: the Internet giants appear more unshakeable than ever. One piece of evidence stayed with me: \n\n> Jeff Bezos has so far added 25 billion to [his net-worth](https://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-twice-as-wealthy-as-mark-zuckerberg-2020-4?r=US&IR=T) this year, while[ 60 percent](https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2020/may/15/coronavirus-has-left-small-publishers-desperately-fighting-for-survival) of UK independent bookstores expect they might not survive this crisis.\n\nHer argument so far is very persuasive, almost inevitable. But I do not completely agree with what comes next:\n\n> It is not just their sizable battle chests that leaves Big Tech so well positioned in this current crisis. Because credit where credit is due: the privileged new class of remote workers can only be sustained because we have access to solid, well-functioning digital tools courtesy of the data barons of the new Gilded Age. \n\nThis is just not true. Remote office work could be done (and *was* done, by a lot of people) in the 1990s. With Mediawiki to replace version control with an edit history (developed 2002) + any chat (which hark back to IRC, developed 1988) you could do 95% of what people do today with MS Teams and the like, give or take bells and whistles. You could even argue that many bells and whistles *reduce* productivity: the rise of Zoom and the like make meetings easier to have online, and meetings tend to be a drag on the productivity of many people. Don't take my word for it, [ask Scott Adams](https://dilbert.com/strip/1996-07-05).\n\nThe lionization of tech companies strikes me as deeply unfair. The most unfair is probably Netflix's. In 1999, Shawn Fanning built Napster as a robust, scalable file sharing service. At that point we could exchange and share multimedia files. Industry sent in copyright lawyers and lobbyists and took it down, and then built it again, sold it to us, and are now using the proceedings to crush independent cultural and media enterprises. In her book *The Entrepreneurial State*. Mariana Mazzucato makes the point that most groundbreaking tech innovation has been made by public sector researcher and funded by taxpayers, with Big tech (and its financial sector-alter ego, venture capital) stepping in when the high-risk work was done, to privatize the reward. That's rent seeking. \n\nA world with great digital tools that are not owned and wielded by Big Tech is absolutely within reach. In fact, Katja herself mentions city halls in Europe  deploying Jitsi servers so that schools can host online lessons. Further on, she discusses resilience: and this would be a major piece of resilience \u2013 the equivalent of 19th century municipalist socialism, when cities built their own utility companies (from transport to energy) to escape the yoke of private monopolies. I am looking forward to seeing whether any polity embraces it.", "created_at": "2020-05-18 14:25:49.562256", "updated_at": "2020-05-19 01:02:50.116580", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 723, "wiki": false, "reads": 28, "score": 410.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4861], "is_private": false}, {"id": 78792, "user_id": 5667, "topic_id": 13861, "post_number": 3, "raw": "![26|690x371](upload://kNVLwO12NuQv4vU5jMJhlhcAsUP.png)", "created_at": "2020-06-11 15:29:03.288150", "updated_at": "2020-06-11 15:29:03.288150", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 5, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21244, "user_id": 2334, "topic_id": 4206, "post_number": 4, "raw": "At the London Hackspace, one of the ways we try to accommodate introverts and extroverts in the same physical space, is we set up one room as \"The Quiet Room\".\n\nIt's used as a space where people can get on with what they're doing without being disturbed.

House calendar\n\nWe are always coming and going. Several times a week you find yourself asking \"can anyone be home on Tuesday at 8.30 to open the door for a guest?\" or \"how many people are going to be at Thursday's house dinner?\". I would like to have an online calendar to function as a timeline for life in the house. It would keep track of:\n\n* When people are travelling.\n* Guests and occupancy of the guest room(s).\n* Events, like our Sunday brunches, dinners etc.\n\nThere are three problems with this. The first one is that it assumes everyone is on the same platform, or at least people are on interoperable platforms. I am no expert on calendar standards: most Reef stuff is currently on Google, but that's not necessarily ideal (not open source). \n\nThe second one is that we need to decide how closely to integrate the House calendar with the work calendar. That's another former non-issue that, paradoxically, emerged as we Edgeryders-the-company folks moved closer to each other. Just two weeks ago I was struggling to schedule a meeting in Brussels because I wanted to include @noemi, but I realised I had no idea of her travelling schedule except that it was very busy right until the end of September.\n\nThe third one is privacy. I guess the house calendar should be private. \n\n### 2. Groceries bank\n\nWhen Noemi moved in, the three of us started sharing all of the food supplies. We will see if our next housemate, David will also want to be part of this. I propose a jar in the kitchen with grocery money: we each put 50 EUR in, then anyone doing groceries picks up cash from it. When it's empty, we refill. I think this is a simple way to ensure we are sharing fairly, and to keep track of how much we are spending on food. \n\nTo prevent any disagreement, we can make this simple low tech more robust by adding two things:\n\n1. We keep receipts in the same jar for a week or so before throwing them away. People can choose to look at them if they are in doubt as to what was bought. Exception: market stalls here are exempt from issuing receipts.\n1. We exclude certain \"luxury\" items from the sharing.

Banking information</h2>\n\nWe currently use two bank accounts, as documented below.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-1\">2.1. Primary bank account (LHV)</h3>\n\nThis is our main bank account, with LHV Pank _[sic!]_ in Tallinn. It is to be used for all operations except for incoming payments in USD. This is because some of our clients insist on paying in USD only but LHV does not have a U.S. American correspondent bank, so wire transfers from the U.S. into our account bounce back. When making outgoing payments in USD, we can use TransferWise, which is integrated with our LHV account.\n\n* **Account holder:** Edgeryders O\u00dc\n\n* **Bank name:** LHV\n\n* **Branch address:** Tartu mnt 2, Tallinn, Estonia.\n\n* **IBAN:** EE12 7700 7710 0255 0175\n(An Estonian IBAN has 20 digits, the letters \"EE\" followed by 18 numbers.)\n\n* **BIC:** LHVBEE22\n\n* **Bank account users:** @noemi and @alberto are so far the only registered user of the account. To add more users, as of 2018-10 LHV Bank _still_ requires a visit of the new user to their offices in Estonia.\n\n* **Document of proof:** To prove the bank account in a form, normally a recent bank statement will do which you can obtain via CFO. Else there is the confirmation letter for the account opening.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-2\">2.2. Secondary bank account (BNP Paribas)</h3>\n\nThe second account is with BNP Paribas in Warsaw. Use it _only_ to receive transfers in USD.\n\n* **Account holder:** Edgeryders O\u00dc\n\n* **Bank name:** BNP Paribas Bank Polska\n\n* **Branch address:** ul. Kasprowicza 119A, Warsaw\n\n* **IBAN:** PL96 1600 1462 1829 8680 8000 0003\n(A Polish IBAN has 28 digits, the letters \"PL\" followed by 24 numbers.)\n\n* **BIC:** PPABPLPK\n\n* **Bank account users:** @nadia is the only registered user of the account.\n\n* **Online banking login.** We use [BNP Paribas's online banking](https://planet.bnpparibas.pl/). It is cost-free to use. To log in, you need access to Nadia's mobile phone.\n\n* **Document of proof:** To prove the bank account in a form, normally a recent bank statement will do which you can obtain via CFO. Else there is the confirmation letter for the account opening.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--3\">3. Financial processes</h2>\n\n**State of completion.** By now, all relevant financial processes from the equivalent document for Edgeryders LbG (\"[Managing the finances of Edgeryders LbG](/t/id/6717)\") have been taken over into this one and adapted as needed. So, no need to look into any legacy document anymore! :slight_smile: \n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-1\">3.1. Accounting for revenue and expenses</h3>\n\n#### Accounting system\n\nWe use FreeAgent (as stand-alone software, not tied to any accountant organization) as our accounting software:\n\n* **base URL:** https://edgeryders.freeagent.com/\n* **login URL:** https://edgeryders.freeagent.com/login\n\n\n#### Reconciling bank statements\n\nBank transaction data are the main input into FreeAgent, but there is no direct feed from our bank account to LHV. We add them semi-automatically, through the following process:\n\n1. **Save the banking statement in CSV format** in the LHV online banking interface.\n\n2. **Convert from CSV to FreeAgent format** using our Python script [`lhv-2-freeagent-converter`](https://github.com/edgeryders/lhv-2-freeagent-converter). There are two versions of the script, use the one that fits your Python version.\n\n3. **Upload the output file to FreeAgent** by using \"Upload statement\" on the main dashboard or in the \"Banking\" menu of FreeAgent.\n\n4. **Upload the output files for forex transactions to FreeAgent (if any).** Our LHV bank account is multi-currency, which means that incoming payments in currencies other than EUR are not converted into EUR, but deposited in \"virtual accounts\" with the same IBAN as the main one, but denominated in the currency of the transaction. Our script `lhv-2-freeagent-converter` detects any non-EUR transaction and exports additional CSV files, one per each currency encountered. The files are always called `transactions_in_[CURRENCY CODE].csv`. These files must be uploaded onto FreeAgent, selecting the \"virtual account\" of the appropriate currency. If no such account exists, you should create it first.\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f416b45dffea26246eebcdb83f710f2fb850872a.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"160\">\n\n5. **Explain the banking transactions in FreeAgent.** FreeAgent will list unexplained transactions and only be happy when that number is zero.\n\n    When explaining the transactions, take care to check the VAT setting resp. to make the right setting there, as that is our largest source of accounting mistakes. The VAT field is there to capture the amount of ***Estonian VAT only***, because only that is VAT that we can claim via pre-tax deduction in our VAT tax return in Estonia. If an invoice by mistake contains non-Estonian VAT, it must not be entered into the VAT field but is simply \"something we paid and cannot get back\". Due to this, the ***VAT to acount for is nearly always zero***. In more detail, there are only these two rules:\n\n    1. Enter non-zero VAT for Estonian VAT for purchases of physical products from a business with an Estonian VAT number.\n\n    2. _Never_ enter VAT for banking charges, even if our bank is itself Estonian. When reconciling banking charges, set VAT to 0%.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-2\">3.2. Checking FreeAgent data for consistency</h3>\n\nWhen tidying up records for making a VAT return or yearly return, here are some ways to check for internal consistency, allowing to spot incomplete / erroneous data in FreeAgent:\n\n* **\"Balance Owed\" is zero or positive for all users.** A negative balance would indicate overpayment, or payment for expenses where the receipts have not yet been entered into FreeAgent.\n\n* **Balance of the virtual conversion accounts is zero.** Refers to the \"Bill / Expense Payments (GBP)\" and \"Invoice Receipts (GBP)\" accounts. For each payment into these accounts, there has to be a payment of the same amount on the same day out of these accounts, serving the purpose of converting the currency of accounting to allow us accounting for EUR payments in GBP within FreeAgent. So if the balance is non-zero, there is either a mistake, or these accounts have been misused.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-3\">3.3. Creating and managing a budget</h3>\n\nThe process for creating a project budget and monitoring it for overspending and cashflow issues during the project is documented in detail here:\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/creating-and-managing-a-budget/9097\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-4\">3.4. Making a payment</h3>\n\nWe _only_ use regular bank transfers, the company's MasterCard credit card and occasionally [TransferWise](https://transferwise.com) for making payments:\n\n* **Bank transfers.** See above for the LHV online banking login. The bank payment feature in there is well-designed and intuitive, so no need for specific documentation.\n\n* **MasterCard.** We have a MasterCard debit card / prepaid credit card, with online payment enabled (card number ending in `2016`). It is in the office in Brussels, as is the PIN code. For normal business, its daily limit is set to 1,000 EUR; its monthly limit to 2,000 EUR. Limits can be changed using LHV's online banking interface, and changes are effective immediately.\n\n* **TransferWise.** LHV Bank is fully integrated with TransferWise. We no longer need to use the company's TransferWise account. Instead, choose \"TransferWise payment\" from the \"Payments\" menu in LHV's online banking, and fill in the required information. We still can use TransferWise to receive money.\n\n* **<strike>Azimo</strike>.** We used it for a time, but [no longer recommend it](/t/id/9082). TransferWise is now the better alternative for all its use cases.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-5\">3.5. Invoicing a client</h3>\n\nThe process of invoicing Edgeryders' clients for work performed is documented in detail here:\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/invoice-issuing-process/9653\n\nIt also covers cases where clients pay us not based on an invoice but another document, like a grant agreement.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-6\">3.6. Invoicing Edgeryders and getting paid</h3>\n\nThe process for submitting your invoices and getting them paid by Edgeryders O\u00dc is documented in detail here:\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/invoice-payment-process/7394\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-7\">3.7. Reimbursing expenses</h3>\n\nThe process for being reimbursed by Edgeryders O\u00dc for your expenses during projects is documented in detail here:\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/expense-reimbursement-process/9078\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-8\">3.8. In-kind benefits</h3>\n\nThere are legal ways how a company can offer in-kind benefits to its employees and collaborators, which offers them tax advantages compared to getting more money. In Edgeryders O\u00dc, we offer this only to close, regular collaborators. In addition, this process is only possible for items that the beneficiary needs and uses for her work for Edgeryders O\u00dc, such a computer or phone. Otherwise the item cannot be justified as a business expense for the company but instead would count as [implicit profit distribution](https://www.emta.ee/eng/business-client/income-expenses-supply-profits/taxation-profits-estonia), which would be taxable for the company and is something we can't do anyway as a not-for-profit company.\n\nThe process step by step:\n\n1. The company buys an item and pays for it.\n\n2. The item is accounted for as an expense of an Edgeryders O\u00dc \"Core\" project in FreeAgent. (Because it is not tied to the execution of any particular client project.)\n\n3. The item is also recorded as an asset of Edgeryders O\u00dc in the accounting system, with its purchase value.\n\n4. The beneficiary issues a credit note document for the cost of the item to Edgeryders O\u00dc.\n\n5. The credit note is recorded in FreeAgent as a \"bill credit note\" in the same \"Core\" project. It is basically booked as \"an invoice with a negative amount\".\n\n6. Edgeryders O\u00dc performs the [recommended reconciliation procedure](https://support.freeagent.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001217770) for netting the bill credit note against the bills already issued by the beneficiary.\n\n7. Edgeryders O\u00dc pays the outstanding bills of the beneficiary, _less_ the amount of the credit note.\n\n8. Edgeryders O\u00dc deducts the cost of the item as business expense, distributed over the legally mandated depreciation time (e.g. 3 years for a computer). This decreases the value of the asset in the books until it hits zero.\n\n9. If you have to include in-kind benefits in your tax statement in your jurisdiction, in addition follow these steps (adopted from recommendations for tax-free benefits to employees in Germany:\n\n    1. Sign a leasing contract with Edgeryders O\u00dc where you pay a low, nominal amount for being allowed to use the item. The leasing contract makes it explicit that getting to use the item is not a gift, so you don't have to include it as an in-kind benefit in the tax statement.\n\n    2. If you use the item for your own business / solo entrepreneur company, book it as a business expense. (Not applicable if you also use the item privately and your jurisdiction mandates that such items cannot be registered as a business expense.)\n\n    3. At the end of the leasing period, you buy the item for its low remaining value that it has in the books of Edgeryders O\u00dc. (In some jurisdictions, there are even rules for this, for example \"3% of new price\" for a smartphone leased to an employee in Germany.)\n\nThis process keeps our project accounting in order, since project costs (and project costs only) are assigned to projects, with their full amounts. It is tax neutral for Edgeryders O\u00dc: it is not possible to deduct the full costs as a business expense in the first year, which increases the profit \u2013 but for an O\u00dc, profits are not taxed until distributed. It is a tax advantage for the beneficiary, since the use of the item is not taxed in their jurisdiction, unlike the equivalent in money.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-9\">3.9. VAT tax returns</h3>\n\nVAT in Estonia is monthly. VAT returns are due on the 20th of the following month: the VAT return for February is due March 20th.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-10\">3.10. Approving and filing the annual report</h3>\n\nThe financial year of Edgeryders O\u00dc coincides with the calendar year. The annual report, relevant for corporation tax, is due by June 30th of the following year. So, accounts for financial year 2017 must be filed with the tax authority by June 30th, 2018.\n\nAccording to Estonian company law, the management board is responsible for approving the annual report and submitting it to the Estonian tax authority. Legally one signature is enough, but we (the management board) have decided that all board members should digitally sign the annual report.\n\nHow it works in practice:\n\n1. **Accountant: Preparate the report.** The accountant prepares the annual report based on FreeAgent data and a short report they will request us to write about the company's operation in the year. (This is required by Estonian law to be included when filing the annual report.)\n\n2. **Upload the report.** The accountant uploads the report onto the Company Registration Portal, then informs one of us by e-mail, who will invite all board members to sign the report, as shown below.\n\n    ----\n\n3. **Board members: log in.** As a board member, go to http://www.rik.ee/en, then navigate there to \"[Company Registration Portal](http://www.rik.ee/en/company-registration-portal)\" and [log in](https://ettevotjaportaal.rik.ee/index.py?chlang=eng) using your E-ID card (needs PIN1).\n\n4. **Find and view the report.** Go to \"Annual reports \u2192 Incomplete reports\" and click \"view\" for the report about the last calendar year.\n\n5. **Download reports.** This next screen contains some general information. Download the annual report's PDF files, both in Estonian and in English. They are easy to find because they have PDF icons.\n\n6. **Check that the report is consistent with FreeAgent**. FreeAgent is the authoritative record for our accounting \u2013 if anyone asks questions we need to be able to refer back to it. To check consistency, do this:\n\n    1. Log into FreeAgent.\n\n    2. In FreeAgent, click \"Accounting \u2192 Reports\".\n\n    3. Examine the Balance sheet and Profit and Loss reports, checking that they are consistent with those in the annual report. The annual report contains the same information, just with slightly different names.\n\n    4. If they are not, inform the accountant and ask why: some further reconciliation might be necessary. Note, however, that the accountant might be presenting the report in a slightly different form than FreeAgent. For example, FreeAgent records depreciable assets at book value (acquisition value - depreciation), while many accountants prefer to record the assets at full acquisition value, and put the depreciation as a liability.\n\n    5. **Important:** Also check the English version against the Estonian one. The latter is, as always, the one with legal value.\n\n7. **Sign.** Back in the Company Registration Portal, click \"Add a digital signature to the report\" and sign (needs PIN2).\n\n    ----\n\n8. **Final signatory only: Add profit distribution information.** After all board members signed, one has to go to the same online place where the signing happened and fill in the form about the distribution of profit or covering of loss. It is important (for us as a not-for-profit company) to not indicate any distribution of profit as that would subject it to taxation ([see](https://www.emta.ee/eng/business-client/income-expenses-supply-profits/taxation-profits-estonia)). Instructions (as derived from how our accountants did it for 2017):\n\n    1. Click the button \"Continue to the next step\" at the bottom.\n\n    2. Add the following two forms to the report: \"Profit distribution proposal\" and \"Profit distribution decision\".\n\n    3. In both forms, fill in the field \"Retained earnings after distribution (covering)\" with the total amount of profit as noted at the top of the form.\n\n    4. In both forms, also fill in the \"additional information\" free-text field at the bottom with a note like this (in English only is fine):\n\n        > According to the Articles of Association, Edgeryders O\u00dc is a not-for-profit company. This prohibits us from distributing our profits, so we retain them for future use in business activities according to the business purpose of the company.\n\n9. **Submit.** As a final step, a management board member or the accountant should then submit the finished annual report by using the \"Submit now \u2026\" button at the same screen where the profit distribution forms were added. Note that this must be done **before or on June 30** for the annual report of the previous calendar year.\n\n10. **Download to archive.** After submission, the submitted files will be available for download in the Company Registration Portal under \"Annual Reports \u2192 Reports submitted\".\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-11\">3.11. Monitoring the company's cashflow</h3>\n\nOur current process is a monthly call with all management board members and project managers to detect and prevent cash flow issues. These calls are coordinated by @nadia. For and in these, calls, we look at the following:\n\n* the [Magic Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fZpP-obQMqCdhORi5RHvYRz7bkuJKTjGAB9MYhfQXk4), our company-wide cashflow forecasting tool (<a title=\"This is the correct link as of 2019-04, pointing into a Teamdrive in our new Google Drive Enterprise setup. Likewise all links to it below.\">hint :speech_balloon:</a>)\n* project status reports by project managers\n* our accounting in FreeAgent\n\n(If you want to use a copy of the Magic Spreadsheet in your own organization, [get it from here](https://github.com/edgeryders/magic-spreadsheets).)\n\n\n#### How to use the Magic Spreadsheet\n\nThis is our main tool to predict and monitor the company's overall cash flow, to look at the size and health of our project pipeline, and to get an overview of the projects we're doing. You can find it in Edgeryders' Google Drive Enterprise space here (but it is only accessible by management board members):\n\n> Team Drives \u2192 Directors \u2192 Finances and Legals \u2192 [Magic Spreadsheet for Edgeryders O\u00dc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fZpP-obQMqCdhORi5RHvYRz7bkuJKTjGAB9MYhfQXk4)\n\nThe Magic Spreadsheet will generate an accurate cashflow prediction automatically, but only if project managers [follow the process](/t/9097). So to detect and fix the most common errors with project budgets, you'd use the Magic Spreadsheet like this:\n\n1. **Enter the day's bank balance** in field `Projects!B1`. (It's possible to automate this with the FreeAgent API, but we didn't so far.) In a perfect world, this should be the only thing you need to do before getting an accurate cashflow prediction in sheet \"Cashflow\".\n\n2. **Make sure all projects are listed.** Starting with October 2018, all Edgeryders projects should be listed in the \"Projects\" sheet of the Magic Spreadsheet. This also includes also all internal projects (core and investment projects) in order to capture all costs for an accurate cashflow prediction. Only projects that were already \"Finished\" or \"Dropped\" in October 2018 are excluded, because they pre-date the Magic Spreadsheet. If a project is not listed, ask the project manager to [create a budget spreadsheet](/t/9097) for it.\n\n3. **Make sure all active projects are marked active.** Because only active projects are considered for the cashflow prediction. You can check this right in the Magic Spreadsheet, on sheet \"Projects\". If you need to mark any one as active, you need to do it in its budget spreadsheet, in sheet \"Status\". The budget spreadsheet is linked from the Magic Spreadsheet, sheet \"Projects\".\n\n4. **Complete sheets CashflowData1 and 2.** Fill down the formulas in columns B and further, to make sure there are as many rows in these columns as there are in column A (where rows are automatically generated). Otherwise, the cash flow graph will show the wrong results.\n\n5. **Check project budgets and costs.** You can go through the active projects in the Magic Spreadsheet, sheet \"CashflowData1\". Sum up a project's revenues to see if it matches what you remember about the project's budget. Sum up the costs to see if it's around 80% of the revenues. You can also look at the predicted project profit margins in sheet \"Projects\" \u2013 each should be \u226520%.\n\n6. **Check project cashflows.** In Edgeryders O\u00dc, the cashflow of all revenue generating projects (\"client projects\") must stay positive. You can check that in sheet CashflowData2 by progressively selecting the cashflow change values in a project's column and ensuring that the sum (shown in the footer) stays positive. This  information is shown in more comfortable form in the project's budget spreadsheet, sheet \"Cost\".\n\n7. **Look at the cashflow graph.** The green line is the company's cashflow prediction. The red line is the minimum of money we always want to keep in the bank. So you can see when the company is approaching uncomfortable or forbidden territory :-)\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-12\">3.12. Obtaining audited accounts</h3>\n\nSome project applications require us to provide audited annual accounts.\n\n_[TODO: Process and cost how to get these. Also detailed information about the various types / levels of audits.]_\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-13\">3.13. Contacting our accountants</h3>\n\nStarting from November 2018, the accounting service provider to Edgeryders is **e-Accounting Estonia OU\u0308**, which is the affiliate of our business service providers, E-Advisors OU\u0308.\n\nLegal address and banking data:\n\n> e-Accounting Estonia OU\u0308\n> P\u00e4rnu mnt 158, Tallinn, 11317\n> IBAN: EE151010220274766225 \n\nThe  accountant in charge of our company and our single contact point is Ms. Diana Baranova.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-14\">3.14. Monitoring fixed costs</h3>\n\nOne of our needs is to keep close watch on fixed costs. Fixed costs are those that we incur in regardless of whether we are doing well or not. They are insidious, because they put financial pressure on the company during a dry spell. \n\nFreeAgent has a helpful report on cost categories. Access it via \"Accounting \u2192 Reports \u2192 Spending categories\":\n\n![image|690x292,70%](upload://e2RS47EKhanaQNZnK2blqYUSaUh.jpg)\n\nThis goes some of the way, but not much. Some categories (\"Accountancy fees\") are indeed entirely attributable to fixed costs; others (\"Travel\") are entirely attributable to project costs; but others still (\"Subcontractor costs\", \"Rent\") have to be split between project and fixed costs.\n\nWe have been taking a different path: using the FreeAgent Projects functionality to keep track of fixed costs. \n\nFor \"pure\" fixed costs (accountant, office rent, web hosting, subscription to SAAS like FreeAgent and Zoom) we use a project called \"Core\". Core is annualized (Core 2017, Core 2018 and so on), so that we can better compare whether core costs go up or down over time, and by how much). \n\nFor \"ad hoc\" investment projects like the [Research Network](/c/research-network), we normally don't bother annualizing. However, if an investment project is meant to be multi-year, you might want to consider whether to annualize it or not. Annualization is valuable if you plan to do something for a long time, and then you need to check that your costs do not grow too much.\n\nNeedless to say, all this requires that _every cent spent by Edgeryders is always allocated to a project_. When reconciling banking transactions, select \"More options\" to choose a project for the transaction you are reconciling.\n\nTo access the \"Projects\" functionality, go to \"Work \u2192 Projects \u2192 [select a project]\":\n\n![image|690x292,70%](/uploads/default/original/2X/0/07242e52633322d42dbdc62f57ecddd3132591aa.png)\n\nThe profitability table shows a grand total for revenues and costs of each project. For Core and other investment projects, there are obviously no revenues, only costs. A breakdown of costs can be accessed from the \"Expenses\" tab.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-15\">3.15. Starting a project in FreeAgent</h3>\n\nWhen creating a new project record in FreeAgent, adhere to the following hints:\n\n**Project currency.** For the project's currency, select EUR, even if the currency used in the project's contract, budget or payments is a different one. Since EUR is necessarily our accounting currency and our only bank account currency, this yields the least confusion about and risk of currency conversion losses / gains. Our budget template (see: [Creating and managing a budget](/t/id/9097)) and cashflow prediction spreadsheet (the \"Magic Spreadsheet\") is already capable to handle this even when the project's contract and payments are made using a different currency. See also the additional hints below.\n\n**Adjusting the budget.** For projects where the contract and payments are in EUR, the budget is a fixed EUR figure and never changes. Enter it as it is into FreeAgent. For projects in a different currency, the budget in EUR is only known after the client paid the last invoice. Before that, it is only an estimate based on past and current exchange rates. Our Budget Template spreadsheet calculates these estimates, but is not yet perfect in  getting the right sum in the end. For per-project profitability estimations (the only purpose of the \"budget\" figure in FreeAgent), these estimates are good enough though. So enter the estimate from the Budget Template spreadsheet when creating the project record in FreeAgent, and correct it at the end of the project, and that's it.\n\n**Managing currency conversion gains / losses.** Since we write our invoices in the contract's currency (for example USD) and use them to explain associated incoming EUR transactions in FreeAgent, there is no need to account for any forex conversion gain or loss using the dedicated FreeAgent feature. That's because FreeAgent is not aware of any difference in EUR between the invoiced amount at invoice date and payment date. So, nothing special here.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-16\">3.16. Managing FreeAgent contacts</h3>\n\nContacts are _external_ people and organisations that the company does business with \u2013 like clients and subcontractors, but not employees. However, since directors and other people paid for contract work in Edgeryders O\u00dc are paid on invoice rather than as employees, they are technically also \"external people\" and we create contact records for them.  \n\nThe important things to know about contacts are:\n\n* FreeAgent needs a contact as references for each invoice / bill we send or receive. Upon creating a new invoice or bill you are prompted to enter the contact it goes to (if it is an invoice) or comes from (if it is a bill).\n\n* When entering a contact, always mark correctly the field \"country\". This affects the VAT calculations.\n\nThe FreeAgent manual contains a [detailed introduction to contacts](http://www.freeagent.com/support/kb/contacts/contacts-screen-overview).\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-17\">3.17. Accounting for grant income</h3>\n\nEdgeryders has two main sources of income: payments from clients (generally from consulting projects) and grants from funding agencies (for example for research or arts/culture projects). \n\nTo get paid by clients, the company of course issues invoices. Grants, on the other hand, normally do not require invoices. This poses a problem with accounting. FreeAgent does have an \"Other Money In \u2192 Grant Income\" category, but when reconciliating incoming bank transfers in that way it is not possible to associate them to projects. \n\nIf you manage a project funded by a grant, proceed as follows.\n\n1. Create a Freeagent project: Work \u2192 Projects \u2192 Add new project. You might also need to create a new Contact for the funding agency, as all projects must be associated to a Contact.\n\n2. Create an invoice for the amount of the grant, and assign it to that project. When the payment comes through the bank, reconcile it as \"Invoice receipt\".\n\n3. At this point, you have the money in Sales instead of Grant Income. To correct for this, create a Journal entry: Accounting \u2192 Journal Entries \u2192 Add new Journal Entry. The entry should have the same date as the invoice. Debit 001 Sales (to remove from the Sales turnover); Credit 058 Grant Income (to transfer the income to the Grant Income). Note: only users of FreeAgent with full access can manipulate Journal Entries. Ask @alberto or @noemi if you are unsure.  \n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-18\">3.18. Recording multi-annual grants</h3>\n\nSome grants are paid to us in advance (for example those for EU Horizon 2020 projects). It is possible that the project that the grant relates to extends over the financial year in which the payment is made.\n\nIf the payment is recorded as grant Income, it arbitrarily inflates profits for the first year covered by the grant and depresses them for the other years. In Estonia, this has no implications on corporation tax and liquidity (since tax is only paid on distributed profits, not on retained profits). But since it's a distortion, we better account for it differently:\n\nThe principle is that, in each financial year, you should only record an amount of grant income equal to the money you spent on that project in the same year (plus the marginality, if any).\n\nExample: Edgeryders receives in March 2016 full payment for a grant of 10,000 EUR. Half of it is to be spent in the same financial year; the other half is to be spend in the next financial year.\n\n1.  When the incoming payment of 10,000 shows up in the \"banking\" section of FreeAgent, explain it (the full amount) as \"Other Money In \u2192 Receipt into Contra Account\". The contra account is a sort of fund: you take the cash (only accounting wise, of course, the money actually stays in the account) and stash it into this fund.\n\n2.  You now want to account for the part of the incoming payment that really pertains to the current year: 3,000 EUR. Create two manual banking transaction. The first one is \"Other Money Out \u2192 Payment from Contra Account\", for 5,000. This takes 5,000 EUR out of the contra account and puts it back in the bank account (accounting wise!). Call it something like \"[project name] 2016 revenue\".\n\n3.  Next, create an invoice for 5,000 EUR, and assign it to the project associated to the grant. You need to do this because it is the only way for us to track profitability of grants, as explained in more detail [above](#chap-2-18).  Once you have created the invoice, mark it as sent, then click on the \"Add a manual payment\" button and confirm. \n\n4. The 5,000 EUR go through an invoice, so FreeAgent sees them as Sales instead of Grant Income. To correct for this, create a Journal entry: Accounting \u2192 Journal Entries \u2192 Add new Journal Entry. The entry should have the same date as the invoice. Debit 001 Sales (to remove from the Sales turnover); Credit 058 Grant Income (to transfer the income to the Grant Income). Note: only users of FreeAgent with full access can manipulate Journal Entries. Ask @alberto or @noemi if you are unsure.  \n\n5.  At this point, you have 5,000 in the contra account; 5,000 recorded as grant income for the current financial year (FYE 2016); 5,000 of costs related to the project for the same financial year (not mentioned in the example, assumed to happen between 1 and 2). The income of 5,000 is associated to the project counted into profits, but not the rest.\n\n6.  When the next financial year comes, repeat 2 through 4.\n\n7.  At this point, you have emptied the contra account (its balance is zero). You also have 5,000 recorded as grant income for the second financial year; and 5,000 worth of costs for the second financial year.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-19\">3.19. Purchasing physical products for Edgeryders</h3>\n\nIf you buy physical products for Edgeryders O\u00dc anywhere in the European Union _except Estonia_, you need to tell the vendor that you are an Estonian company, provide them with our VAT ID and they should not charge you local VAT then. If they do, we lose that VAT because we can only claim _Estonian_ VAT back via pre-tax deduction in our VAT tax returns.\n\nWhen buying online for a company, the vendors know this and automatically ask for our VAT ID and do not charge local VAT then. This happened already to us with CoolBlue, for example. E-commerce is easier than going down to the shop for us.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-20\">3.20. Filing annual accounts with the Estonian revenue agency</h3>\n\nThe Edgeryders directors are jointly responsible for the truthfulness and accuracy of the company's annual accounts. Annual accounts must be filed, in Estonian, by June 30th of the year following the one for which they are filed; so, accounts for financial year 2018 must be filed by 2019-06-30. \n\nThey are prepared by the accountant, and sent to us by email in draft version. Directors must then review them: a useful process is to compare the profit and loss report and the statement of financial position (as found in the draft final accounts) with their counterpart recorded in FreeAgent under \"Accounting \u2192 Reports \u2192 Balance Sheet\" and \"\u2192 Profit & Loss\". Ideally, they should be identical; any difference must be understood before directors sign the annual accounts.\n\nOnce directors are satisfied that the draft annual accounts are a faithful account of the company's operations for the year in question, we proceed to filing. There are two parts to this: \n\n1. Authorize  the *individual* accountant (not the company) to file accounts on our behalf. Instructions for doing this are [on the Company Registration Portal](https://abiinfo.rik.ee/uploads/files/Electronic%20submission%20of%20annual%20account20150622.pdf). This needs to be done by a director with a valid e-ID card. The director must know the individual accountant's personal code.\n\n2. Instruct the accountant to file the accounts on the Company Registration portal. \n\n3. Sign the accounts:\n\n    1. Log in to the [Company Registration Portal](https://ettevotjaportaal.rik.ee/index.py?chlang=eng) using your E-ID card and PIN1.\n    2. At the top of the page click \"Annual reports\".\n    3. Under \"Incomplete reports:\", click \"View\" for the annual report's entry.\n    4. At the bottom of the page click \"Add a digital signature to the report\".\n    5. Add your digital signature using PIN2.\n\nAccounts are valid once signed by any one director. In Edgeryders, we have a tradition of every director signing. Exceptions are possible (for example, when a director does not temporarily have a valid e-ID card), but non-signing directors are still legally responsible for the truthfulness of the accounts, and for any misgivings that might happen connected to the company. There is no legal advantage connected to refusing to sign.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-21\">3.21 Verifying that a payment has been made</h3>\n\nIt can happen that a payment was made by Edgeryders, but does not show on the bank account of the recipient. This has happened especially with non-EU bank accounts. There are two ways to check that there is nothing wrong with the payment.\n\n1. **Check FreeAgent**. If the payment was for a bill (which is most likely), navigate to edgeryders.freeagent.com and retrieve that bill. There are many ways to do it; you can use the search function, or go to the `Bills` page. If you do not have the required level of authorization in FreeAgent, ask someone that does. The bill page reports the date at which the payment was made (in blue, as below). \n\n![image|690x264](upload://22Veseeu7bltZGNDXkj1DJKFs8u.png) \n\n2. **Check the bank's website**. This is the most authoritative way, and also the most up to date: a payment could already have been made, but not show up on FreeAgent yet because the account statement from the bank was not yet uploaded onto FreeAgent and reconciled. You will have to ask one of the bank account users to do this for you: see above, [banking information](#heading--2). Once the payment is located, LHV allows to download two types of confirmation. One in PDF format, which simply contains the information about the sender and the receiver, as well as the date and a serial number for the payment. The other one in BDOC format, which contains the same information plus a digital signature of the bank, the authority issuing the cryptographic keys for the signature etc. BDOC requires specific software to be opened. \n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-22\">3.22. Accounting for payments out of the BNP Paribas Warsaw bank account</h3>\n\nWe also have an account with BNP Paribas in Warsaw. This was necessary, because one of our client won't touch anything else than USD; LHV does not have a correspondent bank in the USA (and does not hope to get one soon); and other Estonian banks turned us down. \n\nWe use this account only rarely, and its online banking facilities suck. So, instead of investing time in automating a process of downloading transactions from it, we use instead a manual process to account for the transactions that go through it. \n\n1. Log into the online banking facility and download the account statement (in PDF).\n\n2. Go to the correspondent account ledger on FreeAgent, starting from the [banking page](https://edgeryders.freeagent.com/bank_accounts). It is the one marked \"BNP Paribas USD\".\n\n3. Do the following for each transaction on the account statement:\n\n     * On the top right of the screen, click on \"More \u2192 Add transaction\".\n     * Fill in the form that opens, with the transaction category, date, amount, etc. The amount is, of course, recorded in USD. \n\n4. When you are done, proceed to reconciling the transaction as normal. The goal is to have no unreconciled transaction.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--4\">4. Other processes</h2>\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-1\">4.1. Signing for the company</h3>\n\n#### In general\n\n* **For identification.** To sign forms for (legal, financial, ...) identification purposes, the signature of one director is enough. This applies where a form says \"signature of authorized representative\".\n\n* **For contracts.** In legal terms, each director has full representation powers. Any limitation to this must be made part of our own rules and encoded in our Articles of association.\n\n* **Company seal.** It is no longer necessary for Estonian corporations to have a seal and we do not have one.\n\n\n#### Estonian digital signature\n\nDirectors of Edgeryders O\u00dc must be e-residents of Estonia. This allows them to digitally sign documents and contracts using the facilities provided by the e-residents scheme. This is only useful in communications with the Estonian state though, as everyone else will not want to use their custom tools to unpack the files and check the signatures.\n\n#### SignRequest\n\nWe use [SignRequest](https://signrequest.com/) to digitally sign all documents that need it, such as contracts and time records. It does not use cryptographic digital signatures but rather authenticates the user via e-mail address and / or mobile phone number. This is certainly sufficient for cases where any kind of digital authentication is acceptable, such as [for H2020 time records](/t/-/9143#heading--3-2). It is probably sufficient by way of mutual agreement for contracts where the law does not require a specific way of signing. However, we did not look into the legal details of that. \n\nNotes about our usage of SignRequest:\n\n* **Never ever delete from SignRequest.** Never delete signed documents from the Edgeryders SignRequest account, as that is the only unforgeable / authoritative evidence of the document signing. All PDFs downloaded from SignRequest could be forged in principle, as they are not digitally signed by SignRequest to protect them against tampering.\n\n* **Syncing to Google Drive.** When the last signatory signs, the signed document, attachments (if any) and signing log are automatically saved into the [admin@edgeryders.eu My Drive \u2192 SignRequest](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fBBLEw7gOMk7fh3dJtQPKparckpJxtBV) folder. This folder is only accessible to directors for data protection reasons. *All* signed documents from the Edgeryders SignRequest account since the beginning of its use have been put in there.\n\n* **Sorting in synced files.** The per-document sub-folders that SignRequest creates in the Google Drive [target folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fBBLEw7gOMk7fh3dJtQPKparckpJxtBV) should be moved to the right places in the Team Drives folder structure. They will not be re-created on Google Drive by SignRequest, so there will be no redundancy.\n\n    When moving them, rename these per-document folders using an adequate naming schemes. That provides a way to find any signed document again quickly in Google Drive. For example, we use the following naming scheme for the folders of signed time records:\n\n    ```\n    Time Records - [project] - [collaborator] - [yyyy-mm]\n    ```\n\n* **Finding the authoritative version.** If there is a need to also find the authoritative version on SignRequest for a signed document found on Google Drive, one can quickly locate it by searching in [SignRequest \u2192 My documents](https://signrequest.com/#/documents) for the internal SignRequest filename mentioned in a document's audit log PDF.\n\n* **H2020 time records.** We provide detailed instructions for signing time records for H2020 projects in [Reporting for a H2020 Project \u00a7 Signing Time Records](/t/-/9143#heading--3-2).\n\n* **Dealing with e-mail delivery.** In case that the SignRequest e-mails for signing documents do not reach the recipients due to classification as spam or similar, you have two options. First, you can tell your participants to [create a whitelist entry](https://www.lifewire.com/a-1172106) for the `no-reply@signrequest.com` e-mail address or entire `signrequest.com` domain. Second, you can make sure that your recipients have a signrequest.com account for the e-mail address you send the sign requests to, and then tell them via a different channel to log in there and sign the new sign request that you sent them. SignRequest does not require to have an account to sign, and will not tell you which recipient address has or does not have an account associated to it, so you will have to ask your recipients about that directly.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-2\">4.2.

The reply is signed by Kristjan K\u00fcti, Senior inspector, authorised by Director General.\n\n> The companies do not have to register their sensitive data processing from 25th of May, 2018 and the old register will be archived. After the 25th of May the companies have to inform data protection authorities about the appointing of Data Protection Officer (articles 37 of GDPR). The companies which are established in Estonia can do it through the e-Business register. The GDPR superseded the Estonian Data Protection Act. \n\nThe Data Protection Officer is currently Matthias Ansorg.

Creating and documenting a process</h3>\n\n**You're welcome to process innovate.** When you discover a lack of structure or organizational mess in the Edgeryders organization, you are welcome and encouraged to create your own process. Thank you for making our organization a better place! :gift_heart: Your process will then serve as \"the official way to do it\" in our organization, until somebody sees a need to improve or replace the process again.\n\n**But always document it!** To be an official process, your process must be documented, and its documentation must be navigable from the relevant manual topic in [Documentation & Support \u2192 Collaboration](/c/docs/collaboration). Otherwise, as far as our collaborators are concerned, _it does not exist_. There's just no practical way that our collaborators would bookmark a multitude of topics in various categories to know how things are done in Edgeryders.\n\n**Conventions for documenting a process.** We have a standard practice for documenting our processes, mostly developed by @matthias. You can glean it mostly from looking at [our existing manuals](/c/docs/collaboration), and from the notes below. It would be great if you follow this as much as possible \u2013 no big deal if it's not perfect, as @matthias will tidy things up when doing the next pass over our documentation. \n\n* A manual document about a process is a topic in [Documentation & Support \u2192 Collaboration](/c/docs/collaboration) of which the first post of the topic is set up as follows:\n\n    * made into a wiki\n    * tagged #manual\n    * owned by user @community_wiki\n    * using the :green_book: icon at the start of its title\n    * made into a sticky topic in its category\n    * using [our convention for the structure of long or complex documents](/t/id/6463#heading--3-2)\n\n* You can outsource parts to other topics, linked from the manual topic. But these other topics should also be wikis, tagged #manual-section, owned by user @community_wiki and follow the same [convention for content structure](/t/id/6463#heading--3-2).\n\n* There should not be inconsistencies between your new process and any other process that is documented already. If necessary, you will have to modify the documentation of other processes as well.", "created_at": "2017-03-20 18:27:21", "updated_at": "2020-10-01 19:04:32.511730", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 9521, "wiki": true, "reads": 63, "score": 1478.6, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [47909, 52012, 38004, 47741, 3672, 6004, 38849, 3398, 5963, 6433, 55649, 65122], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 4861, 4795, 5, 4897], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11374, "user_id": 1487, "topic_id": 1934, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>one purpose to rule them all :)</b>\n\nI believe there is always purpose.

Everyone has their own vague sense of purpose and by acting with that in heart &amp; mind contributes to a defacto mixed-purpose. Thats the vagueness that I currently experience in EdgeRyders. This vagueness isn't isolated only to the platform as a tool but to the entirety of EdgeRyders: the public facing website, the business model (and the discussion around it), the platform, the projects.\n\nThe great thing though is that I believe THERE IS a clear purpose (it became clear when I met with [Noemi] face to face).

I can say our collaboration was a smooth ride mostly...the only thing I didn't like was when you told me I should open the workshop with talk about Edgeryders instead of you and you said it the moment we were starting :smile:.

Also, I have done extra things which were never talked about or put in contract and I don't mind...I never was the type to say \"these are my tasks/objectives and that's all I will do\".  Glad to see you guys are as flexible as I am so, it is turning out well...so far very positive and learning experience for me.\n\nI know you also feel like I haven't documented/explained the process I followed after the workshops :slight_smile:, you said it's only in my head. I am creating a very clear schematic of the process and most importantly the why of it. It will be shared with everyone here once it's done (few days). I am doing it for the community as well.\n\nOne thing I think we really need to improve on is the platform UI. I have easily 70% of people having complaints about it. Some things are really easy to fix like:\nHave the +New Topic in a different color or place it somewhere on the right...many people don't even see it and the eye is pulled towards the blue colored category/subcategory and \"latest\".\nMaybe the animation I am working on will improve on that part but again, we should have it somewhere so every newcomer can see it.\n\nAnother thing would be, the double weekly call we had. One with you mostly and one with @MariaEuler felt like there was redundancy. We would clear up everything in one meeting anyways so maybe we could streamline that process in some way.

What exactly are you seeing?\n[/quote]\n\nThis is exactly what I said to @johncoate in our meeting --- if it was just me as an ethnographer doing my own research, I would love to analyse the long rambling interviews. But it doesn't work as well for SSNA -- in a long, long interview, 100 codes co-occur and there's no designation of meaningful separation between topics. And from the CM side, it's really hard to get people to engage and respond to those long interviews. \n\nI see two options here, and pursuing both might be wise:\n\nOne, we treat interviews as a different kind of material and figure out how to either break them up manually or code them differently. This is something we should do anyway, if we are going to keep going down the route of uploading field notes and interviews. \n\nTwo, we try to focus our energy on shorter but highly focused interviews (so, we ask them to tell a specific story) so that we get the depth, but not the wide range of topics. We discussed in the call that the best posts from Open Care were ones that were discussing a narrow range of issues through a very focused story. \n\nYour event summary is great, since it generated lots of conversation, and is around a pretty focused topic (even if it's long). That's the tough thing -- we kind of have to judge this after the fact. The numbers you generated somewhere else could be helpful, re how long a post can be to still get interactivity, but we have to exclude the event planning posts from them because they confound everything (long posts with lots of comments, but not ethnographic).", "created_at": "2020-10-06 09:16:15.660509", "updated_at": "2020-10-06 09:16:50.189476", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 329, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 6.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [84421], "is_reply_to": [84421], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 65154, "user_id": 5528, "topic_id": 11505, "post_number": 13, "raw": "Come and hear about Collaboration, Collective Intelligence and Next Generation Internet technologies that facilitate this to happen!\n\n***Schedule and Content:***\n\n09:00 am - Registration, coffee and networking\n\n09:30 am - Welcome words, data and collective intelligence.

He defines it as a critical tool used by organizations to understand business risks and make critical strategic decisions. In fact, there are specific keywords linked to financial modeling: Decision making, Assumptions, Model, design, Developing, etc. Yet they all occur in one Excel sheet.\n\nIndeed, a robust and flexible model can be described as the art of combining accounting finance and business metrics to build a representation of your company to excel in the future.\n\nThe reason why a business needs a financial model is to study a company\u2019s financial history and to use the history and the information available to predict the company\u2019s performance in the future. Therefore, you can learn a lot about a company\u2019s revenue growth profile, cost structure, margins, and earnings growth by analyzing its past performance.\n\nThe most basic financial model is a 3-way model that refers to the three financial statements named an Income Statement, Cash Flow, and, most importantly, a Balance Sheet.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the most common use of these models is for the decision making usually in an operating Company, Corporate division, finance, and accounting staff, Etc. Also, it is used to make investment decisions in a given company. Additional use is for price security. It is mainly for companies desiring to issue more shares or further debts.\n\nThus, they need a financial model to value these securities. Besides, it might be the ability to project working capital requirements into the future accurately.\n\nAs for who uses financial modeling, it would-be analysts in investment banking, equity researchers, credit analyst, managers, and finance people..\n\nConsidering the steps that ought to be followed in building a financial model, one should start by taking historical data and storing it in an Excel file; it should be at least three years of information.\n\nThe second step is to calculate historical ratios, metrics, turnover rates.. It can serve as foresight on what the future holds for your business.\n\nOnce you have analyzed the past, you can decide in terms of margin, growth rate, capital spending.\n\nThe following step is forecasting, the most important one, which is mainly decision making, which allows you to reflect all these numbers into the future to make efficient predictions. Typically, the forecast is 3 to 5 years long.\n\nThe final step is the Valuation. It means valuing the company or the business to come up with robust ideas or decisions. To do that, most companies use Discounted Cash flow (DCF). Then, an additional analysis might be added to support the types used, such as charts and graphs.\n\nAs for the three statement-model, the first element is the income statement, also referred to as a \u201cStatement of Financial Performance\u201f or a \u201cProfit & Loss Statement,\u201f which provides a summary of the revenues, costs, and expenses of an entity during an accounting period. It is generally used to calculate the Net Profit After Tax (NPAT) of an entity.\n\n![|1250.300688x705.433712](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/If7P-o7yLlOPK7dnUsU5tvYXEQbkqlTRKr09OVcy0hYWFYFjZwS3Zv7qPYMB_TEnNzt1bWe-2yK4JHbDMkgMYn9qTYggRvqjTWZAxABjagMTq97rMOQdt1BW7Fd1a1kDKv2dm9E5)\n\nNext, there is the Balance Sheet, also referred to as a Statement of Financial Position\n\nthat shows the status of an entity\u2019s assets, liabilities, and Owner\u2019s equity at a point in time, usually the close of a month.\n\nIt provides a snapshot of the entity\u2019s financial position, including the cumulative results of the Income Statement and Cash Flow Statement at a point in time. It is essential for getting investors, securing a loan, or selling even your business.\n\nWhile income statement reports profitability, balance sheets represent the value of the business.\n\nFurthermore, the balance sheet has three sections: assets that are equal to Liabilities and Owner\u2019s equity.\n![https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/maT4LIr3zO5ZfkqM_5uS_hTo32JBvyBmuOcLpZMMNa7o1R6eHhRpAlNsrRs3_1NTcEMyC5VzdO4osk-K7XDxjr1tkq0uzF4IBTjge96sWSiSvz3vFIqIrQwOCuDGJCcD0pTwdQfu|624x309](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/gaAUFRBadnK3oQLGW75TrL6LYhBIToYYRNvWUmdzeynMAJ6O9vDCECTkGXqq6KAGe1TMH8xGeFYK4aVk1M-ZE6xMv6lHKAQFHjyxFMp7YjgXp4m-q7ilMtQBnlOERTCYA1IZlXYl)\n\nMr. Heni brought to the attendees\u2019 attention that unlike the other statements that reflect costs and revenues in a given period, the balance sheet is an instant report, a snapshot in time at any given point, where the business stands.\n\n![|1334.844888x757.2830832](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/K205Y1kIta1mwysYMiuTJSk08kHCW3f3-DQd_2jShF41uegQqxEjDH24ZF0skxICp73BUIlhUgiJl54U6ON5Q1o7lsRQaGactX6s9oid4FlDF25Nsnl2OknbYTte1qQy5e37Z8f6)\n\nThe following figure shows the elements of a balance sheet:\n![|1140.4343184x634.4511768](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/knI74CG0d04h4vUEReab403KP78kELKN3XLCOjc4vXqEfpPzrzv4YI33CZ6MUSBGaF5hRX_AqfbLrhclP-zdM6vVz6tFGHCNhrMu_wWoMAXGNA1fQ1I82jEiSdYhE7Rh75HMMrac)\n\nThe final statement is the statement of Cash Flows (SCF), which breaks the analysis down according to operating, investing, and financing activities. It also shows how changes in Income Statement and Balance Sheet accounts affect cash and cash equivalents during an accounting period.\n\nThen he displayed a metaphor to illustrate the cash flow according to the figure down below, stating if the water balance (or cash balance) rises, then there is a cash INFLOW, if the balance decreases in the current period, then it\u2019s an **OUTFLOW.**\n![|624x332](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/lyI8KGZiDozLWJJd_PHS0RqtLN4Mh6-sjlAvWTdAJPgaYK4_OwYtW5EGBmK01O73FQZQUybltzRL4_HCn4lCCGf4dcsvDe3xH6NL7jULjygxXgckDkgOqRLtDgd15UUw-GltT2pK)\n\nMoreover, it is essential to mention that Cash Flow Statement contains: operational activities, investment activities, and financial activities\n\n.\n\n![|624x283](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/rvFHIYku-l5soxaX_hU2XJk-P8fjfHfvXlePDQrR12iiiU_-caTDqiKOxGM05DR4c6X6F945zO8WP310v-EjEf9AO6kwQPaPTjXPD3NAXD4bUO5PQ-aNMrMr954zuvbBzgP9y89T)\n\nOperational activities are the activities that constitute the primary or main activities of an enterprise. As for Investing activities, they represent the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents. Last but not least, financing activities relate to long-term funds or capital of an enterprise, e.g., cash proceeds from the issue of equity shares, debentures, raising long-term bank loans, repayment of bank loans, etc.\n![|844.2471648000001x476.67728960000005](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_mRfMyI2dmL4B2hZony8eRhi7wlbDQ-sb4Ll6dUM6Jcdb73hcBgGCqwaRVHwHM3uOnVw-z4mCv7fMeOAzHuOqyr0bOfn3l9EEYAEoDON85XcXzR78YA8QMCyW2SyNFcTOIwxtD6R)\n\nTowards the end of the lab, Mr.Heni concluded by explaining the most important valuation methodologies of measuring the cash flow of a project. Unlike traditional techniques, discounted cash flow (DCF) valuations take into account the specific financial performance of all future years.\n\nHowever, such valuations are very sensitive to small changes in input data and while providing the scrupulous analyst with a potent tool. DCF takes the cash flows from the 3 statement model, alter the necessary parts, and then uses the XNPV function in Excel to discount them back to today at the company's Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC).\n\nCertainly, the advantage of a DCF valuation is that it allows the free cash flows that occur in all future years to be valued, giving the 'true' or 'intrinsic' value of the business.\n\nHe finally gave some tips to build an efficient and simple model. For instance, the model should be simple, well structured using a good layout while indicating the drivers, assumptions, and visual outputs.\n\nAlthough, one needs to acquire some skills to make an excellent remarkable financial model such as Finance and accounting, Excel skills, Logic, and design.\n\nSpecial thanks to Mr. Heni Htira and for the relevant interaction from our brilliant project leaders for ensuring such a productive and successful lab.\nThe offline task is:  **''Based on this training, Design and Develop your 3-statement-financial-model for your project.''**\n\n**Q/A section:**\n\n**Q(@saif.eddine.laalej :** Is there an online tool for valuation or maybe a file?\n\n**A:** I don\u2019t think there is an online tool because the tool you are using comes from your work; it should be adapted to your own business data.\n\n**Q:(@Mohsen )** Can you explain again what COGS means?\n\n**A:** Cost of goods sold (COGS), it refers to the direct costs of producing the goods sold by a company. This amount includes the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the good. It excludes indirect expenses, such as distribution costs and sales force costs.\n\n**Q: (@ Ben Ameur Mohamed Ali)**\n\nOn page 21, in the excel sheet, under fixed assets, I didn\u2019t get the term \u201cLESS accumulated depreciation?\n**![|815.0299635x457.42428809999996](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/9clgDr30C0S2b92KYbppKxUlx4LgPa1k4_UZQHIUwtuxskntwLeZxAZZgtwpyDnMAxOaUNp7qv9rY_m2w7qvuBhqxI5bHfWxIYFxCr1-QXj42nsvlce_OCOMy4n_V_VNPJgsC8hx)**\n\n**A:** In french, it's called \"amortissement\", it is the expenses that have been taken until today for those fixed assets. Eventually, the depreciation amount can become at a certain time equal to the total amount of the fixed assets, which means total fixed assets would be 0).\n\n**Q: (@Mohsen)** Should we work on two assumptions for the next three years?

Introduction</h2>\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1-1\">1.1. About this manual</h3>\n\n**What you'll find here.** This manual documents the knowledge about distributed collaboration (also called \"remote work\", \"telework\") that we developed in our organization [Edgeryders O\u00dc](/t/6640). We are a distributed organization since our earliest beginnings in 2012, that is, including the time before our spin-off and incorporation.\n\n**Motivation.** Distributed collaboration can avoid a drastic amount of greenhouse gas emissions from business travel (esp. air travel), from daily commuting to work, from the energy consumption in commercial buildings, and from the embodied emissions of constructing new office buildings. But distributed collaboration is not easy, often frustrating, and therefore not nearly as widely adopted as it should be. We believe that, as an organization with 7+ years of experience in this area, we have an obligation to share our expertise freely and widely \u2013 it is our best possible contribution to help fighting the climate crisis.\n\n**Structure.** All chapters past the introduction present their knowledge as a collection of recipes / best practices / [patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern). They try to be specific enough to be easily understandable and quickly applicable, but general enough to be relevant for most organizations that have to deal with information management.\n\n**Content licence.** This is an open source document under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 Unported licence (CC-BY 4.0), or at your option any later version. <!-- TODO: Add the CC-BY logo.-->\n\n**Acknowledgements.** This manual has been created with the funding and support of [EIT Climate-KIC](https://www.climate-kic.org/), a European climate action organization. EIT Climate-KIC is supported by the European Institute of Technology (EIT), a body of the European Union.\n\n![EIT-Climate-KIC-EU-flag-transparent|690x254,50%](upload://rRCxtfLkIeCHIkDyp0JVHNeLan7.png)\n\nIn addition, this manual as an open collaboration project received precious contributions from people in EIT Climate-KIC, the Edgeryders company and community, and from the Internet at large.\n\n**This is a wiki.** This distributed collaboration manual is itself created by distributed collaborators, and you're welcome to contribute to this open source project. Being a wiki also means that the content is never truly finished: we keep adding to it and extending it also after the end of the initial funding that made us start this manual. For that reason, you will always find some draft sections and TODO markers throughout the document \u2013 and you're welcome to help us out:\n\n**How to contribute.** However you obtained this manual, the most recent version is always [this wiki on edgeryders.eu](/t/11263). After opening a (free) account on the edgeryders.eu platform, you can join the discussion thread below that wiki, adding your feedback, reports of problems with the document, or proposed additions. If you feel confident about your contribution, you can also directly contribute it by editing the wiki. The wiki uses Discourse flavoured Markdown for formatting, all of which is documented in our [Discourse User Manual](/t/6463).\n\n**How to work with us.** If your organization faces challenges around distributed collaboration that are not addressed in this manual, and you want our help to solve them, you are welcome. Edgeryders O\u00dc is available for consulting in this area as long as we can also include the resulting knowledge into this manual \u2013 under an open content licence, and of course in a general, anonymized form. You can talk to @matthias about this: either send a direct message here on the platform, or an e-mail to [matthias@edgeryders.eu](mailto:matthias@edgeryders.eu).\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1-2\">1.2. Editorial overview</h3>\n\nWelcome to the distributed collaboration manual that was created with distributed collaboration. :blush: To give you a smooth start, this section shows the relevance of and connections between the tips and techniques (\"patterns\") that appear in seemingly random order in the rest of this document.\n\n**What is in it for you?** This manual wants to make your distributed work smooth, enjoyable and efficient. Smooth and enjoyable collaboration is a group exercise, you cannot solve it on your own: you will learn how to make your colleague's experience smooth and enjoyable, which is basically about \"being a good citizen\" of your organization. Your colleagues will (hopefully!) reciprocate the same to you, and this is how your own work experience becomes smooth and enjoyable. We explore this aspect in more detail in section \"[The secret of enjoyable distributed work](#heading--1-4)\". A good part of this is the insight how values work: even if it does not profit you personally in the moment, you can still aspire to follow high standards in your collaboration because you anticipate the beauty of the system you're part of building this way. Admiration for beauty is food for the soul \u2026\n\n**On business trips.** Let's say you have a trans-Atlantic business trip coming up but because it's only 2020 and electric and biogas powered climate-neutral jets are still a matter of the future, you rather want to avoid it if possible. To determine if the trip is necessary at all, we have [some tips in our Green Travel Manual](/t/-/10552#heading--1-1), a separate document. Section \"[Tips for calls](#heading--2-18)\" will contain useful knowledge about how to replace that trip. Also see \"[Tips for conference calls](#heading--2-19)\" on how to replace meetings with groups of people.\n\n**Advantages of distributed collaboration, and how to unlock them.** Calls may not be as pleasant or rich of an experience compared to meeting in person. However, other aspects of distributed collaboration can compensate for that as they can be more enjoyable than long (and often boring) business meetings. In our organization we discovered that asynchronous communication techniques provide many enjoyable freedoms that calls and meetings can never provide: you choose time and place and pace of your work, when to have a break, and interruptions by your cat :cat2: or partner won't matter at all (if you don't mind). It will take some time to \"get this right\" with your colleagues because there is no formal education about this kind of work yet, anywhere. You probably have the [tools](#heading--5) for it already: more or less any shared file hosting, any chat and any online forum tool will do. When dealing with product development, an [issue tracker is also helpful](#heading--3-1). The challenge is more how to use these tools so that both you and your colleagues will love this way of working. At this point, we recommend you read about \"[The secret of enjoyable distributed work](#heading--1-4)\": it sets the stage by showing the social dynamics of lovable and horrendous digital work environments. It's strong stuff, but not meant to discourage you. And we (Edgeryders) are also still far from perfect in following the value-driven approach presented there.\n\n**Getting into asynchronous collaboration.** Asynchronous work is not enjoyable by default, so to help you get there we gathered our best practices, sharing them with you below (see the \"[Communicating](#heading--2)\" and \"[Collaborating](#heading--3)\" chapters). There is also a whole chapter \"[Socializing](#heading--4)\" dedicated to practices that focus on social interaction at work rather than on efficiency. Please consider this a starter kit only \u2013 welcome to contribute your own tips.\n\n  &nbsp; Before you dive into all the tips and tricks, remember that best practices here are social: you can't make your own experience of distributed collaboration enjoyable, but only that of your co-workers, and vice versa.\n\n  &nbsp;Some of the best practices are simple common sense, such as being \"[Clear, precise, complete](#heading--2-1)\" when it comes to communicating \u2013 and mind you, you can not not communicate. Other practices are less obviously valuable, but quite powerful: a combination of [pull-based communication](#heading--2-3) [systematic, beautiful filenames](#heading--2-11) with [no data redundancy](#heading-2-12) and with [an effort to anticipate](#heading--2-14) where your colleagues will look for the data you want to dump is, taken together, a surefire way to make shared folders an enjoyable tool to use. And maybe that's a good strategy to beautify distributed work: make one tool enjoyable, only then care about another.\n\n**Zen level: a fully distributed organization.** The chapters about communication, collaboration and tools show how to use *existing* tools and processes for more enjoyable distributed work. Now if you are in the lucky position to have some control over the organization's processes and tools, you can and should go further. Over time, you can modify the organization so that \"being distributed\" is embedded into the organization's DNA. With that in place, much of the friction in internal and external collaboration will fade. On top, the organization will be part of the avant-garde: the new wave of organizations adapted for a low-carbon future. Plus, you can harvest additional benefits like space efficiency, cost reduction and work / life integration. We cover some of this in the last chapter, \"[Building distributed organizations](#heading--6)\".\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1-3\">1.3. Reasons for and against distributed work</h3>\n\n[TODO]\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1-4\">1.4. The secret of enjoyable distributed work</h3>\n\n**How bad work habits are self-stable.** Distributed work is a chicken-and-egg problem: as long as it is unenjoyable and unrewarding for themselves, workers are not motivated to put in the extra effort to make it enjoyable and rewarding for their co-workers. That extra effort refers to best practices of communication and collaboration, as described at length in this manual. As a result, the dismal and inefficient nature of distributed work can be a long-term stable condition in an organization. Even short-term investments of the required extra work by one or some workers does not change it: a *bit* of investment after years of malpractice does not immediately make distributed work enjoyable for everyone, and also making the mental shift towards investing the extra effort themselves takes time. <!-- TODO: There are probably better concepts of metaphors to describe this in social sciences. -->\n\n**The importance of values.** We saw that the necessary condition to move towards enjoyable, efficient distributed work is this: that some of the workers make it an unconditional priority that working with them in a distributed way is enjoyable for their co-workers. An unconditional priority is a moral or professional *value*. There may be good reasons to have a certain value, but these cannot include a \"return on investment\" for the individual practicing that value \u2013 because that would make it conditional again, unfit to break the self-stable nature of unenjoyable distributed work.\n\n**Working like a humble servant.** The question remains: Why should I pick up a value that may not pay off for myself, in my lifetime? We can find answers in monastic traditions \u2013 independent of the religion, monks and nuns understand how and why to provide an enjoyable environment for each other, just the same thing that we want in digital workspaces and work culture.\n\n  &nbsp; In our organization, we have looked in some detail into monastic practices, as part of a communal living and social innovation space called \"unMonastery\" \u2013 the space it was not religious, but deeply inspired by the rules and best practices of monastic communal living. What we found was the exaltation of service to the community: this is the secret of monastic living. Imagine two monks gardening in a Benedictine monastery, tending to pretty flowers and nutritious plants. What motivates them to do this well, year after year, with no wage at all? It's not about producing flowers and food, it is about creating the environment for their brethren\u2019s spiritual journey to be successful. The monks need healthy food and restful spaces to tend to their bodies and souls. Every time a monk takes a mouthful of food, he or she is eating the embodied service of fellow monks to them. Every time a monk admires the cloister\u2019s garden, or the monastery's architecture, he or she is gazing at the embodied work of other monks, most of which are dead for centuries. There is no higher work than that which survives the passing of the worker. By holding up the monastic community, and ultimately God, as the higher purpose within which personal service finds its fulfillment, the monastic community also becomes a self-stable enjoyable environment. There is almost permanent individual gratification by *not* pursuing individual gratification but instead serving The Whole. When The Whole works well, it also goes well for the individuals. But a group of individuals will never get to that place when valuing their own immediate well-being before that of The Whole.\n\n**Practicing the secret.** We discovered which mindset can make distributed collaboration (or any collaboration, for that matter) an enjoyable experience for everyone. It's basically the [Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule), \"the principle of treating others as you want to be treated\". But how can we encourage that mindset in an organization? Ultimately every organization will have to find its own path here. Here are some inspirations, and you are very welcome to add your own in the comments:\n\n* **Lead by example.** A core group of collaborators who internalized this \"secret\" can decide to show its benefits by example. This is much better than starting alone, as every member of that core group can already see glimpses of the enjoyable work environment whenever they are \"digitally treated well\" by their co-workers in distributed collaboration.\n\n* **Provide time to appreciate organizational beauty.** The appreciation of beauty is perhaps the best way how humans can understand and internalize values that pay off only in communal terms. You could provide space and time in your organization for all workers to visit or explore value-driven organizations like monasteries or post-capitalist companies that thrive in distributed collaboration. Ideally these would be extended site visits so that the experience can sink in, but documentaries or books can also be good mediums, depending on the person. Once members in the organization realize that \"it would make a beautiful workplace / society / country / world if everyone adhered to this value\", you are already close to the goal.\n\n* **Organization-building with memes?** The Golden Rule and everything said above stays abstract theory until you find ways to express and embody it in the context of your organization. The Golden Rule applied to data is basically \"Provide your data how you want others to provide their data to you.\" Whatever you do with data, do it in such a way that other people don't inherit your mess \u2013 but rather have a good time using your data. If memes are a thing in your organization, you can totally meme-ify the Golden Rule for Data in many ways and see if that helps.\n\n* **Hire a wizard.** In our organization, we are glad to have @johncoate as our \"wizard\" of community building. If you can find one, hire a wizard for distributed collaboration. A wizard is a person of calm natural authority and extensive wisdom in their area, not afraid to share that wisdom with others whether they want or do not want to hear it at the time. The wizard may take on some roles in projects of the organization, but mostly to analyze and understand the pitfalls of the current work culture. He or she would then influence tools, practices and processes to improve that, both via formal and informal (trust based) channels. It will only work when you give your wizard a lot of freedom to do their magic.\n\n* **Introduce best practices.** The Golden Rule for Data is still abstract, and nobody will be able to immediately see all that it entails for their day-to-day digital communication and collaboration. For that reason, a set of best practices is the second and last essential ingredient for enjoyable distributed work. We provide our own collection of best practices in the remainder of this document, and you are welcome to mix and match them with your own and use them in your organization.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2. Communicating</h2>\n\nOur \"educated guess\" as distributed organization of 7 years is that 70% of the efficiency and enjoyability of remote works comes from good communication and collaboration techniques, and the last 30% from the tools. Also, good technique can make up for less than optimal digital tools. Among other things, this allows to use open source tools \u2013 often less sophisticated than commercial alternatives, but providing all the freedoms of [free software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software).\n\nTo illustrate the limited role of tools, just remember the worst directory structure and file naming you ever encountered. Your cloud storage account with 100 [tebibytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tebibyte) of storage is worth nothing at that point because you can't even find a single _byte_ of what you're looking for.\n\nSo let's start with the basics: below is a collection of tool-agnostic best practices for digital communication. Communication is about coordinating *information*, while collaboration is about coordinating *action*.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-1\">2.1. Clear, precise, complete</h3>\n\nPeople appreciate it when verbal communication is coherent, in full sentences and with a clearly understandable pronunciation. In other words, when somebody puts in effort to express what they have to say. This is especially valuable in a professional context and even a selection criterion when hiring (\"presentation skills\", \"fluent English\" etc.).\n\nThe same is not yet true for written communication like instant messaging, online forums, comments on collaborative documents etc.. On average, collaborators put in little effort to make this communication clear, precise and complete, and when this becomes part of the workplace culture, it becomes self-affirming (\"My colleagues write the same way to me, I'm not going to add extra effort.\"). But as a result, this lack of digital communication culture makes distributed collaboration inefficient, unenjoyable and often enough unworkable.\n\nAs a (somewhat specialized) example, let's look at what makes a good problem report about a software issue, either to customer support or to the developers:\n\n* what you were trying to do, step by step\n* what you expected to happen\n* what happened instead\n* if and to what extent the issue is reproducible\n* exact text of error messages or logfile entries\n* additional diagnostic insights from verbose logging, debugger use, core dumps etc., if you have\n* workarounds, if you found any\n* proposals for how to fix the issue, if you have\n* version of the software you are using\n* version of software dependencies like browser and operating system\n\nThis is not meant as instructions but to sensitize you to the problem; namely that \"dear devs, please improve the general user experience\" is not a complete or actionable problem report :slightly_smiling_face: For more detailed techniques for clear digital communication, see further below in this list.\n\n<!-- TODO: Reference a good, well-known short book about clear, short, precise writing in English.-->\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-2\">2.2. Minimize the receiver's work</h3>\n\nThis is a direct application of the Golden Rule for Data (see [chapter 1.4.](#heading--1-4)): \"Provide your data how you want others to provide their data to you.\" Nobody wants to do the extra work resulting from an unclear or incomplete question coming in by e-mail, chat or any other means. So when reaching out to others, it is only fair to avoid any avoidable work for the receiver \u2013 in other words, as the sender don't be lazy.\n\nLet's look at a few examples:\n\n* **Non-activated hyperlinks.** Not all tools provide automatic recognition and auto-linking of URLs. For example when writing a HTML e-mail and pasting a URL as plain text, you can't be sure that the receiver will be able to click on it. Instead, they might have to copy & paste it to their browser's address bar. That is click work, and \"click work is also work\" as user interface designers like to say.\n\n* **Excess notifications.** You can send a long, structured message in two ways in a chat: one paragraph per message, or all paragraphs in one message. The first one creates excess notifications, and looking up notifications is work.\n\n<!-- TODO: more examples -->\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-3\">2.3. Pull-based communication</h3>\n\nTime spent on back-and-forth communication, and the delays introduced by it, is _the_ biggest inefficiency in distributed collaboration. And documentation is _the_ major way to solve it.\n\nIdeally all relevant organizational knowledge and project knowledge is available online to all collaborators, in a well-organized and well-maintained form. Together with \"[read the friendly manual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM)\" as organizational culture, this creates pull-based communication as the default.\n\nAs a result of having everything in the manuals, people get stuck less often in their work, and interrupt each other's work less often. And when an avoidable question is still asked, then answering it is now fast, with a link to a manual section.\n\nPull-based communication also implies that spelling new organizational knowledge out into the manuals is an important task for every collaborator. In addition, manuals require updates and \"debugging\" just like software. We found that a comment section below the manual for questions about unclear or missing manual content serves this purpose well.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-4\">2.4. Anticipate and avoid back-and-forth</h3>\n\nThis refers to anticipating responses and difficulties of your communication and solving them already before sending off your communication. This prevents delays and endless back-and-forth communication, which are the worst and most annoying properties that remote work can have.\n\nFor example, there is a tendency to use e-mail for very short messages, esp. inside organizations. Each cycle of message exchange induces delays that are at least 1-2 orders of magnitude larger than actually writing the messages. So a better way to use e-mails is like snail mail letters to a pen pal: anticipate what they will say and answer that as well, because this way you will make 2-3 steps of progress with each exchange of e-mails. Instead of half a step because of unclear communication about a single step. There are more details about this example in [a topic in our forum](/t/10615).\n\n<!-- TODO: Write this section, eliminating the link to our forum. -->\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-5\">2.5. Find the system, follow the system</h3>\n\nIn the ideal case, there should be a system for every aspect of how to organize the data of an organization. Only with a system, data is retrievable and re-usable. Without a system, a collection of data becomes more entropic and less useful the more data you add. Data without order is noise!\n\nSo when you want to add more data to a collection of existing data, your default expectation should be that \"there must be a system\". With that expectation, go looking for the system: it might not be documented explicitly, but you can infer it from looking at the existing data in the collection. For example, file names. And then, just follow the same system when adding your data, because anything else would mess things up.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-6\">2.6. Make hyperlinks beautiful</h3>\n\nWhen you copy &amp; paste a URL into almost any digital collaboration tool, it will be automatically linked (\"made clickable\") by the tool. People quickly find this feature, and because it is so convenient, it's the default how links are sent around.\n\nBut straightforwardly inserting a URL creates the most ugly form of a link: it's a long, confusing string of characters that is highlighted to grab attention but has often no meaning of its own, so the reader has to look around in the text to understand what it is for. It looks ugly on screen and on print, it can have privacy issues and it breaks the flow of reading a sentence. All this makes digital collaboration a bit more frustrating and less enjoyable for the recipient. Once, it's not a big deal. Over years, it adds up.\n\nHere is everything we know about communicating with hyperlinks in the best possible way:\n\n* **Find out how to use a link text.** If you don't want to send the bare URL but give your link a readable link text like here [like here](https://www.example.com/)), you have to somehow add information to the link text to make it \"special\", transforming normal text into a link. How to do this differs between the different tools, so just google it or look into the manual. Most up-to-date tools however use one of two ways. The first is a rich-text editor where you highlight the text and click a button that opens a dialog where you enter the link target URL. The second is Markdown where you write your link like this:\n\n    ```plaintext\n    Regarding [our recent discussion](https://example.com/) about \u2026\n    ```\n\n    to get this:\n\n    > Regarding [our recent discussion](https://example.com/) about \u2026\n\n    It works in a surprising number of tools, including Discourse, Riot, comments in Google Docs, Github README files etc.. Just try it to find out if your tool understands Markdown.\n\n* **Support skimming.** Naturally, a cross-reference is an important part of a text, and a hyperlink is also visually highlighted. So when you choose your link text appropriately, hyperlinks support both fast comprehension and fast visual navigation by letting the reader skim through, reading only headings and links.\n\n* **Do not use link shorteners.** Link shorteners like [Bitly](https://bitly.com/) give URLs a shorter alias and were originally used where only URLs and not proper hyperlinks could be posted, and esp. where an additional character limit applied (Twitter). Nowadays, link shorteners are rather used to get insights about who visits the link, so some people consider them a privacy intrusion and don't like them. Also, when hovering over a link one can no longer see to which site it finally goes, hiding information from a user that would help her judge if to visit the link or not. There are exceptions where you really need a short URL (see below), but in general link shorteners are not a good idea to use.\n\n* **Use short URLs.** The URLs of hyperlinks are often very long. That looks ugly when you have to send them as a URL and also when the reader hovers the pointer over a link to look at the target URL. Without the clutter, it is often easier for a user to judge if they want to visit that URL. In addition, long URLs often contain information that you don't want to share (such as your username or account ID so the website can track who shared the link). So where possible, remove any parts that are not essential for the functioning of the link. This can be done in roughly 70% of cases to some extent, but requires an understanding of URLs and some guesswork:\n\n    [details=\"The different parts of a URL and how to omit them\"]\n\n    <!-- TODO: Maybe outsource this part to a Q&A on Web Applications Stack Exchange.-->\n\n    In the order of appearance, URLs consist of the following parts:\n\n    * **Protocol.** This is either `http://` or `https://` and is always needed. The exception are relative links inside the same website: then both the protocol and the domain part can be omitted because they don't change. The reader will still see the protocol and domain part when hovering over a link, because the browser adds them automatically. But  omitting them when writing content is still better because (1) it makes your text more readable and shorter if written in Markdown or other source format rather than a rich-text editor, (2) it will not break if the website, such as your blog, is ever moved to a different domain. For example in [Discourse](https://discourse.org/), a popular forum software, relative linking enable very short internal URLs to other forum posts like this: `/t/1234/12`.\n\n    * **Domain.** This is for example `example.com` or any other hostname. Sometimes it includes one or more levels of sub-domains before that, for example `blog.example.com`. All this is required, except for relative links (see above).\n\n   * **Path.** The path always starts with `/` and contains multiple directory names and optionally a filename. It ends at the end of the URL, or one of the special characters `#` or `?`. Originally this referred to directories and files in the filesystem on the webserver, and often it still does, but websites also use this more freely in the sense of a logical rather than physical path to information. In that case, redunant path elements can often be omitted because the software does not use them. For example, in Discourse a typical path is `/t/topic-title-here/1234/12`. Here, the correct guess is that `1234/12` are topic and post ID and sufficiently identify the content. The `topic-title-here` part can be omitted, and the link keeps working. As an example from our platform, consider the following links to this manual, both of which work:\n\n        > https://edgeryders.eu/t/distributed-collaboration-manual/11263\n        > https://edgeryders.eu/t/11263\n\n        Sometimes, only parts of a path elements can be omitted, because the website splits the element into an essential and an ignored part (that is only there to inform search engines and the like). For example, only the last part of a medium.com article link is the article ID and essential, while the title can be avoided. All of these links work:\n\n        > https://medium.com/@will12000/climate-is-missing-the-point-we-have-an-ecosystem-emergency-211b1a348fd\n        > https://medium.com/@will12000/211b1a348fd\n        > https://medium.com/@will12000/-211b1a348fd\n        > https://medium.com/@will12000/a-211b1a348fd\n\n        The third and fourth option show what you can do when the title is clearly not completely avoidable, but also not essential. Instead of just `a` you could also insert anything else and the link would still work. Medium does not need this trick, but many newspaper websites do.\n\n    * **Subpart marker.** A subpart marker is an optional string of the form `#name` that follows the path. It identifies the part of the website to scroll or otherwise navigate to after loading the page. It often changes automatically while scrolling, so you might inadvertently copy a URL with a subpart marker while wanting to refer to the whole page, starting with the top. In that case, just delete the subpart marker.\n\n    * **Query string.** The query string is an optional string of the form `?name1=value1&name2=value2&name3=value3&\u2026`, that is, multiple pairs of variable name and value, connected with `&`, and all starting with `?`. It may or may not be essential: if the path already identifies the content, you can try omitting it, as it probably not needed for anything. For webpages where you filled form elements beforehand to see what you want to link to, these parameters are important though because they contain this input. But even then, there are often individual variables that are either at their default value, have an empty value, or are outright useless. You can try omitting them. As an example, when googling for \"enter google into google\", the resulting URL is at first something like this (sooo ugly :worried:):\n\n        > [https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&ei=kde1XeTRLI_WwQLTrJmwBw&q=enter+google+into+google&oq=enter+google+into+goo&gs_l=psy-ab.3.0.33i22i29i30l2.1617.13458..14715...2.0..0.89.2401.39......0....1..gws-wiz.....0..0j0i22i30.hKIP_UZevZY](https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&ei=kde1XeTRLI_WwQLTrJmwBw&q=enter+google+into+google&oq=enter+google+into+goo&gs_l=psy-ab.3.0.33i22i29i30l2.1617.13458..14715...2.0..0.89.2401.39......0....1..gws-wiz.....0..0j0i22i30.hKIP_UZevZY)\n\n        Nearly all of the query string variables can be omitted. This still works and looks so much better:\n\n        > https://www.google.com/search?q=enter+google+into+google\n\n    [/details]\n\n<!--\n* _[TODO: How to integrate hyperlinks into natural language text seamlessly.]_\n\n* _[TODO: Tips to find the right URL in various applications, esp. in Google Drive for PDF files Could be a Q&A on Web Applications Stack Exchange.]_\n\n* _[TODO: How to use hyperlinks to make your communication shorter and more relevant in the future.

Include the source format</h3>\n\nBasically: provide freedom to operate to the recipient of a work by also enabling them to make changes as desired. For a PDF with text, include the word processor source format as well (at least as a link). For graphics, include the XCF (GIMP native files, like PSD) resp. SVG files as well.\n\n<!-- TODO: Elaborate on the points above more.-->\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-8\">2.8. No middleman</h3>\n\nIf somebody has to communicate or negotiate on your behalf, it hardly ever increases efficiency. Rather, it results in misunderstandings and delays.\n\nAvoid middlemen wherever possible. For example, don't let one person in your organization collect and relay requirements for a design contract that your organization wants to hand to a third party. Instead, invite the contractor to join your online forum, Slack channel or similar and discuss with the relevant people in your organization directly.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-9\">2.9. Allow for peripheral awareness</h3>\n\nKeep all communication within your organization as open as reasonably possible. This is easy to do with a central online forum accessible to all your collaborators. Over the medium term, peripheral awareness by following others' communication from afar gives collaborators context and learning opportunities, which prevents misunderstandings and delays in the future.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-10\">2.10. Add reasonable formatting</h3>\n\nText formatting is not just eye candy \u2013 a good visual and logical structure is rather the \"user interface\" of your text. As with software applications, a good user interface supports navigation, and a bad user interface inhibits it. Supporting \"navigation\" in a text means to provide adequate visual cues for a reader to be able to skim through the text \u2013 which means, getting all the important points and where to find them again in 10% of the time it would take to read everything.\n\nThere are a thousand ways to build a user interface, and text formatting is no exception. However, here are some best practices to support skimming, with the limited formatting options of Markdown:\n\n* **Obvious heading structure.** After jumping to any random location of the document, a reader should be able to determine if they are in a chapter, sub-chapter or sub-sub-chapter, from just looking at the nearest heading. The simplest way to achieve this is to preface every heading with a chapter numbering using decimal classification such as \"1.\", \"1.2.\", \"1.2.1.\" and so on.\n\n* **Table of Contents.** To get a quick overview of a document's content, a ToC is one of the simplest and most effective ways. Hyperlink the ToC entries to the chapters, if possible. A ToC becomes even more useful when you take care to formulate your headings with a system. For example, this very document has three chapters where the naming scheme is \"a single word for a class of activities\": \"Communicating\", \"Collaborating\", \"Socializing\". That makes it simple to infer that these chapters probably have a similar sub-structuring, and once that is understood, navigating the whole document becomes much simpler because the reader can make an educated guess what to find where. Compare that to a case where the top-level chapters have random, confusing, wordy names:\n\n    > &nbsp;1. Abstract\n    > &nbsp;2. Communication skills are the manners of the Digital Millenium\n    > &nbsp;3. Techniques for Distributed Collaboration\n    > &nbsp;4. Let's now select the right software\n    > &nbsp;5. Modifying the whole organization\n\n* **No formatting without a style.** Most word processing software allows to create custom formatting styles, which makes formatting text semantic. You could for example create a character style called \"line header\" and the software would make sure that it looks the same whenever you apply it. A reader will recognize such recurring formatting and learn from these examples about the role you use it for, which again helps the reader to navigate the text \u2013 by reading only the line headers while skimming, for example. In simpler software such as online forums, custom styles are usually not available, but you can make sure by yourself to use formatting options in a consistent way. In this document for example, all line headers such as at the start of this paragraph are simply formatted with bold print.\n\n* **Paragraphs, not line breaks.** A paragraph is basically a line break plus a small vertical gap separating it from the previous block of text. That gap helps in visual navigation, as it allows to jump between cohesive units of content more quickly. To create a paragraph in plain text or Markdown, use an empty line between blocks of texts. In other word processing software, just don't press <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Return</kbd> because that's how linebreaks are made. Press <kbd>Return</kbd> instead.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-11\">2.11. Use systematic, beautiful filenames</h3>\n\n![This comic portrays a person who has taken a careless naming convention to an extreme, giving hundreds of documents essentially the same confusing or useless filename. Another person appears to have a severe distaste for this convention (or may just be in shock at how one could be so lazy or incompetent in the short term to suffer through or ignore the consequences in the long term) and hence provides a protip to never look in someone else's documents folder for the fear of finding these irritating details](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/documents.png)\n\n*(Source: [xkcd 1459](https://xkcd.com/1459/), licensed under [CC-NC 2.5](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/).

No redundancy</h3>\n\nRedundancy can be good or bad: redundant checks and calculations can protect against mistakes, and backups can protect against data losses. But redundant _live_ data is a major source of inefficiency in collaboration:\n\n* It creates confusion as your collaborators have a hard time knowing which version of a file is in use, or which is the most up to date.\n\n* It creates synchronization problems when people accidentally work on different versions, thinking theirs is the last one. Ever tried comparing two lengthy Google Docs documents to make a common version?\n\n* It creates duplicate work, as the same errors have to be found and fixed in multiple versions.\n\n* It takes up more storage space. Not just once, but multiplied by the number of backups you keep.\n\n<!-- TODO: It seems better to convert the list above into a paragraph of text.-->\n\nBefore you copy any data, take a second and think if this is really the best solution to your problem. Avoiding redundancy applies to all types of copying data:\n\n**How to avoid redundancy.** In 90% of cases, redundant data is not the solution. Here are ways to avoid it.\n\n* **In documents.** Use cross-references. Ideally, your word processor or editor will be able to insert hyperlinks with auto-updated chapter numbers and names. However, cross-references can also make a document hard to read, as it is no longer \"mostly linear\". A good content structure is the best way to avoid excessive hyperlinks.\n\n* **In source code.** Usually you would better create a new function (instead of copying inside your own program) or library (instead of copying between programs). More complex techniques can be found in software design patterns (take the well-known \"Gang of Four\" book as an example here).\n\n<!-- TODO: More list items. -->\n\n**How to use redundancy.** Sometimes, redundancy is the best available solution. That applies whenever the maintenance effort of the new structure you would have to introduce to _avoid_ redundancy is higher than the effort added by the redundancy itself. So when you minimize the additional work created by redundancy, redundancy _can_ be the best solution to a problem. Here are some tips for \"effortless\" redundancy:\n\n* **Clearly mark any redundancy.** For files, a numeric version number as a filename element, just before the extension, is a good tip. Use enough leading zeros to make your file manager show the last version last. In addition, any exported versions from source formats are also redundant and should be recognizable as such. See below for example filenames:\n\n    ```\n    WebsiteInfographic.V01.svg\n    WebsiteInfographic.V01.Export.HighQuality.jpg\n    WebsiteInfographic.V01.Export.WebQuality.jpg\n    WebsiteInfographic.V02.svg\n    WebsiteInfographic.V03.svg\n    WebsiteInfographic.V03.Export.WebQuality.jpg\n    ...\n    ```\n\n* **Make redundancy temporary.** Let's say you have to prepare a selection of 10 out of 100 files that should be sent off as a print job to an offset printing company by a colleague. Instead of sending 10 filenames or a verbose description of how to select the 10 files inside their folder, it will be much simpler for your colleague if you just create a new folder with copies of these 10 files inside. Then call it \"`Print_Job_2019-12-30_(COPIES_ONLY,_DELETE_AFTER_USE)`\" or similar to clearly indicate that this is redundant stuff for a specific purpose and that the redundancy should be fixed once that purpose is fulfilled.\n\n<!-- TODO: More list items. -->\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-13\">2.13. Be mindful with others' attention</h3>\n\nAttention is work: the work of reading the message or notification, going to the place it points to, understanding the context, if it is important, and thinking about the appropriate (re-)action.\n\nSo when attention is wasted on unimportant matters, it lowers collaboration efficiency. That doesn't mean that you have to avoid any single \"thank you!\" message in chat, but to be aware of what could be annoying rather than helpful communication, partially by observing your own reactions to notifications, and by observing how your digital tools work in detail.\n\nLittle tricks include:\n\n* **Line breaks.** Learn how to make a line break when instant messaging. Usually it's pressing <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Return</kbd>. This allows you to write a single message per request / issue / occasion, not one per paragraph, and correspondingly you'll also only cause one notification rather than a lot of them in quick succession.\n\n* **Reacts.** In several instant messaging systems, there are now ways to react to a message with an icon (thumbs up, heart, \u2026). These do not cause a notification so do not demand immediate attention but still allow you to express gratitude, agreement, sympathy and so on. Especially in a group chat situation this is helpful, as each additional notification there demands the attention of several people. There is some subtlety to their use though: they are used for a mild expression of emotions, because the receiver knows that you know that the receiver might not see them because they don't cause a notification. So if you want to confer a strong reaction, want to say something loud and strongly and powerfully: use something that _does_ cause a notification.\n\n* **Ask before calling.** Of all forms of communication, audio or video calls demand the most attention because one can hardly do anything aside and one has to react the moment the call comes in. So it seems to become established culture slowly that before making a call, it is respectful to ask via instant messaging when is a suitable time. This is an inversion of former \"phone culture\" when the phone was the main means of telecommunication \u2013 it doesn't mean that [people forgot how to use the phone properly](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/05/ring-ring-ring-ring/561545/), but that we have now more tools in the toolbox and are slowly learning how to use each for its purpose.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-14\">2.14. Data retrieval empathy</h3>\n\nWhen collaborating in a way so that all relevant information is available to all collaborators in a shared repository (see: [pull-based communication](#heading--2-3)), the big challenge is how to enable others to find what you put in. If, on the other hand, every collaborator keeps all their information on their own computers, that is not the challenge \u2013 they hopefully know how to find information again on their own computer when being asked by a collaborator. But these requests for files and other data consume worktime and produce delays, so it's worth facing and solving this challenge.\n\nThe best principle is, in our view, what could be called \"data retrieval empathy\": imagine where your collaborators would look for the piece of information you want to sort in, and then place it exactly there in the shared information repositories. For this, a good technique is to think about where you yourself would look for this piece of information, had a collaborator created it.\n\nAfter some practice with this, you will notice some patterns, which can also help you to find the right place for information:\n\n* **High cohesion.** In each repository of information, there are multiple mechanisms to structure information. In a file system for example, these are folders, files, and the various ways to structure files (which depend on file type). In a Git repository for source code, these are in addition branches, forks and tags. In almost cases, these mechanisms form a hierarchical data structure: text is structured inside files, files inside folders. This means, the mechanisms differ by granularity. Now the general principle to sort in a new piece information is to use the most granular (most \"low level\") mechanism that is suitable for the task. Because this keeps the information as close to its most related information as possible, which in turn makes it well findable because collaborators will look first into places \"where similar stuff is found\". Keeping related information close together in this way is here called \"high cohesion\". Note that this is a rough rule of thumb with many exceptions, but still a useful guideline.\n\n    Here is an example to flesh this out: Let's say you created an expense registration spreadsheet for a new project and want to place it somewhere in a shared file repository like Google Drive. The most fine-grained mechanism to structure data in this repository that you have available is \"inside the files\". The rule says you should consider that first to place your spreadsheet somewhere \u2013 which would lead you to consider putting it into a new sheet (\"tab\") in an existing budget spreadsheet file of that project. If that is not suitable for some reason, then the next more granular mechanism is the level of files: you could place it as a new spreadsheet file into the same directory as the budget spreadsheet, with the filename indicating its relation to the budget spreadsheet. By letting both filenames start with the same prefixes, you keep them close together when a user looks at the containing folder's file list. \"Close together\" means more cohesion, and more cohesion means better findability. The two filesnames could be for example `Finances:_Budget` and `Finances:_Expense_Registry`.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-15\">2.15. Refactor, fix, optimize</h3>\n\n[Refactoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring) is a technique used in software development to improve the quality and structure of a program's source code without changing its behavior. We use it here in an analogous sense of improving the structure of documentation, a file system or other data without changing what it *means*. Corrections and optimizations of documents on the other hand are improvements that will change their meaning.\n\nIdeally this \"digital housekeeping\" becomes a constant habit for every collaborator for dealing with shared data like manuals, spreadsheets and files in general. It basically means: when you see a quick way to improve shared data, do so immediately. When you see a way to point out shortcomings but don't know how to fix them, add a comment. Of course manuals and documentation have to be editable for all collaborators for this process to work. If the organization is concerned about data integrity and correctness when giving even new collaborators full edit access, it can use a versioned editing system where all changes can be inspected and if necessary rolled back.\n\nBenefits of such a habit of constant improvements of all shared data include:\n\n* **Collaborative issue discovery.** Processes in an organization change quite often, at least in parts, and it is hard to update all references to the old process accordingly in the documentation. But if readers catch and correct inconsistencies while using the documentation, these inconsistencies are fixed the first time they cause an issue to somebody. It's the equivalent of [Linus's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_law), just for distributed collaboration that is not limited to writing software: \"Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.\"\n\n* **Collaborative copyediting.** Copyediting is about the clarity of the words and explanations. For example: A sentence or paragraph in shared process documentation is unclear to one reader, but the meaning becomes evident after thinking about it for three minutes. By editing the text to clarify that meaning, the collaborator saves the same three minutes for every collaborator who would have the same issue with the same passage afterwards.\n\n* **Collaborative structuring and formatting.** It is unreasonable to expect that every collaborator has all technical writing skills, but everyone can contribute something: the content, the wording, the structure, the formatting, or the illustrations. Writing starts with the raw content of course, and if the author does not have the time or skills to add well navigable structure and formatting, it's ok to leave the content like that. Others will come in afterwards, be grateful to find the content documented at all, and contribute improvements to wording, structure, formatting and so on. <!-- TODO: Split this out into its own point: \"Incremental writing\".-->\n\n* **Growing the structure with the content.** When organizing data, it is very often not clear at the start how many records of the same type will have to be added: 10, 100, 1000, 100 000? Starting with a structure that is suitable for 5000 (like a database) means a lot of overhead effort in setup and access when it turns out that only 200 records are added. So it is generally better to start with a structure for a lower estimate and migrate the data to a different structure when the need for that arises. That migration also is overhead effort of course \u2013 so try to shoot for a structure with the lowest expectable overhead over the lifetime of the data. <!-- TODO: Split this out into its own point.-->\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-16\">2.16. Structure data with hierarchy</h3>\n\nThe human mind has some rather severe cognitive limits. For example, psychologist George A. Miller found in his highly-cited 1956 paper \"[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two)\" that 7\u00b12 is a useful heuristic for the maximum number of list items that the human mind can remember and process simultaneously. Beyond that limit, the mind will sub-structure the list and use other techniques to process it, requiring much more processing effort per list item.\n\nThat's makes hierarchy probably the most useful data structure for comfortable and fast processing of information by the human mind. For example, generally you would present a table of contents for a document not as a long linear list of sections but structured into chapters and sub-chapters, with \u22649 sibling items at each point of that hierarchy.\n\nThere are some caveats. You only need hierarchy in data data meant for immediate processing by humans \u2013 for example in documents, books, team lists. You do not need it for data that is only accessed by a computerized information retrieval system, such as a search in a knowledge base with thousands of Q&A articles. You also do not need it for lists that can be used without keeping all items in mind simultaneously, such as lists of alphabetically sorted glossary entries, or lists of instructions meant to be followed one by one. Also note that, while hierarchy works to structure both data and people, we recommend it for data only because it generally causes suffering when applied to people.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-17\">2.17. Separate urgent and non-urgent communications</h3>\n\nLike others, this technique follows from the same principle of using the attention of your collaborators sparingly. Where urgent and non-urgent communication happens in the same channel such as one chatroom, collaborators are forced to look up each notification immediately because it *could* be an urgent message.\n\nThat is solved where urgent communication has its own channel, resulting in dicernibly different notifications. Then, collaborators can let non-urgent notifications pile up until there are enough to deserve looking at an until there is a good opportunity to read and answer the messages. That makes a big difference in the amount of attention that the notifications deserve: instead of 100 notifications interrupting ones workflow 100 times a day, now there are perhaps 10 interruptions in good moments, each to process an average of 10 messages.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-18\">2.18. Healthy calls</h3>\n\n[TODO]\n\n<!-- TODO: When to use calls, when not. -->\n\n<!-- TODO: Tips when inside a call. -->\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-19\">2.19. Healthy conference calls</h3>\n\n<!-- TODO: When to use conference calls, when not. -->\n\nWhen inside a conference call, here is a list of tips to make it an enjoyable experience for everyone. All the [tips for calls](#heading--2-18) apply as well, but there are additional tips specifically for group calls:\n\n* **Conference calls are a listening exercise.** In this way, they are no different than healthy in-person meetings: in a call with 10 people, mathematically everyone has 10% of speaking time and 90% of listening time. When that ratio becomes skewed too much for some speakers, the call is very likely not productive. Some people naturally like to speak a lot and may not notice they are cornering the other participants \u2013 a software tool that calculates and shows the speaker time percentage in real-time may help. It could show that privately to each speaker, or as a public list to the whole audience, providing an interesting cue for healthy communication. We did not yet find such a tool.\n\n* **Mic off when not speaking.** This is probably something that everyone learned by now about conference calls with more than three or four participants: unmute yourself when you're speaking, and mute yourself again afterwards to spare everyone your background noise. Still, people regularly forget one of the two; a PTT (push-to-talk) functionality in a video conferencing application would solve this, but we are not aware of any tool that can do this.\n\n* **Cameras on.** Depending on the type of call, asking everyone to switch their camera on can be useful to provide additional social cues. For example, a team leader may find it helpful to check in on the wellbeing of their team in a weekly call. *(contributed by: Lisa, [here](/t/12096))*\n\n* **Cameras off.** The freedom to keep ones camera off is also valuable, and often the \"not so social\" people prefer it as their default. In internal team calls where at least some people participate as listeners (\"for peripheral awareness\") rather than actively most of the time, \"cameras off\" is a good option as it gives additional comfort and freedoms to participants. It makes it ok to answer the door, to grab a coffee, to take a phone call in parallel, to answer e-mails, to have a short talk with a flatmate or colleague when necessary, and similar relaxations compared to in-person group meetings. The important aspect is to use these freedoms for efficiency, not for hiding ones complete non-participation. In the latter case, the problem is rather that the organization is forcing people to be on calls for no reason at all.\n\n* **Finger up gesture.** The gesture of sticking up a finger in a video call can be used to indicate that you want to speak but not interrupt the current speaker. It still gives the current speaker a good cue like \"if in doubt, please keep your contribution short\". *(contributed by: Lisa, [here](/t/12096))*\n\n* **OK gesture.** Similarly, showing the \u201cOK\u201d gesture with thumb and index finger (:ok_hand:) can be used to show silent approval of what somebody said, and also to give a silent affirmative answer to a question. For example, asking for remaining questions before ending the call can be done in a nice way that does not result in awkward silence: \"Does anyone have a further question for the group, or are you all ok now?\"\n\n* **Moderator role.** Depending on the context and occasion of the call, in any group call with more than 4-8 participants one of them should hold a moderator role.\n\n* **The chat is your friend.** Most video conferencing tools provide a side channel text chat, both for the whole group and pairwise between participants. This is an additional communication channel that can be used to partially overcome the narrow bandwidth of group meetings aka \"only one speaker at a time\". For larger conference calls such as webinars or brainstorming sessions, it makes sense to even assign a separate moderator to the chat, in addition to the video call moderator. That moderator would relay questions to other speakers at the right moment, would gather input for a written protocol / transcript etc..\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-20\">2.20. Auto-correct reading mode</h3>\n\nUnderstanding communication is mental work. Even with all the best practices collected in this manual, it will remain an effort, in part because communication will always be imperfect: people will be tired, make spelling mistakes, have and express unclear thoughts, forget to include links, apply messy formatting and so on.\n\nHere, active reading with a kind of mental auto-correct mode helps to reduce the delays of back-and-forth communication. For example: instead of asking back what an unclear sentence means and waiting two hours for the answer, two minutes of going through the paragraph in detail and trying to find and follow its internal logic may already solve the mystery.\n\nWhen this is about written communication within a whole group, such as in an online forum, it makes sense to then just edit the original author's contribution by fixing the mistakes. Even just fixing spelling mistakes or messy formatting or adding missing links will reduce the work of understanding of everyone who has to read this afterwards. In our organization, we practice this informally to various degrees in [our Discourse forum](https://edgeryders.eu/), supported by automatic edit notifications. This way, the original author can catch the rare case of disimprovement edits \u2013 where the edit does not express what they wanted to say.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--3\">3. Collaborating</h2>\n\nThe last chapter dealt with the basics of digital communication: how to use the digital tool at hand in the best possible way? Now this chapter goes a step further, dealing with collaboration, the coordinated action to get stuff done.\n\nCollaboration always involves multiple processes and tools, which together form an interface of a worker, both to other workers and to the organization. The challenge is to select the interface adequately, suiting both the task at hand, the timeframe, the organization and the worker's personality. Collaborators in an organization can have different interfaces, but it is a good idea to have overlapping elements that apply to all (such as instant messaging). Also note that the chosen interface in turn shapes the style and results of somebody's work.\n\nThe sub-chapters below discuss multiple best practices for these collaboration interfaces. Which one is best under which circumstances is often not obvious. It becomes easier after several years of practicing digital collaboration, but will still require experimentation. And that's ok: there is no solid management theory for distributed collaboration in sight, anywhere. In general, choose the most narrow interface that is suitable for a person's role and personality: fewer tools equate to less coordination overhead and better self-organization on the collaborator's end.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-1\">3.1. Issue tracker plus coordinator</h3>\n\nIssue trackers have been developed for managing software development, esp. related to bugs (\"issues\"). Software development is basically always an exercise in distributed collaboration between software users and developers.\n\nIn addition, issue trackers work well for any well-defined task, especially purely technical tasks that change only products and documents but not people and their activities. It is also well suited to work truly globally across time zones, and to integrate people into a distributed team who come from a different culture and background.\n\nThis works because an \"issue\" should be a self-contained task that the assignee can work on without any further back-and-forth communication. For this to work, such issues should _not_ be created by end users of a product who want to report a problem, because that results in unclear and incomplete reports and a lot of back and forth communication. Instead, a team leader (or rather: team coordinator) who is skilled in digital communication techniques and also knows the project or product very well should take on all this communication work for their team. It includes:\n\n* **Task coordination and time planning.** General project management which is the basis to then create feature request issues, their deadlines, and to assign them to developers.\n\n* **Issue descriptions.** Describing each issue in such a way that the developer can get it done without any follow-up questions. This is very different from how issue descriptions typically come in from users.\n\n* **Issue assignees.** Distributing the work between the developers, based on availability and skills.\n\n* **Issue deadlines.** These would depend on project work deadlines.\n\n* **Outward communication.** Or at least be the first to react to issue reports by users and other people inside the organization, taking off the mental load of error analysis from team members.\n\n* **Testing.** Once an issue is done, the bugfix or feature needs to be tested.\n\n* **Documentation.** Most developers hate to end user write documentation for their software, but the coordinator can take this on when there is time. Even a little documentation goes a long way.\n\nDoing this for a team of 5-8 people is already a full-time job \u2013 this is also the drawback of this technique: it just does not scale well. Also it is obvious that the team leader's task here is to serve their team members, making their workflow as smooth and friction-less as possible. Ideally, team members will have very little mental load with work coordination: when they finish one task, they will just pick the next task from the top of their list. They will also have very few interruptions, the exceptions being @mentions in the issue tracker and occasional instant messaging with the team coordinator. This allows them to focus and be productive in their work.\n\nIn an ideal organization, there would not have to be a team coordinator and instead everyone who needs something done that is to be managed with an issue tracker would follow the guidelines from above. However, that's asking for superhuman abilities: due to a lack of domain knowledge and due to a lack of long-term interest in the product, the average person just cannot care enough. Instead, choose the person as team coordinator who has the deepest expertise about a product and the deepest personal interest in its future, long-term development. You want a person interested in product quality and with a vision for the concerned product. Otherwise product development can quickly deteriorate into a messy assortment of quick fixes.\n\nWith respect to personal suitability, we found that structures people (\"people who love lists\") who do not crave human interaction much are good candidates for using an issue tracker as their main \"interface\" in a distributed organization. It can provide a well-structured, stress-free job of just working through the issue list, always picking the most pressing issue next. There are no calls or meetings to attend, so it is also very suitable for digital nomads.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-2\">3.2. Let them work but monitor the progress</h3>\n\nThis technique applies for work that has a natural scalar metric. For example, the progress of editing or translating or otherwise processing text can be measured in the amount of words that were already progressed. If all tasks are different from each other, the \"issue tracker plus coordinator\" technique will be more suitable.\n\nFor this technique, the team leader or manager needs a software tool that can measure and visualize the progress of team members along the chosen metric. Team members get their task in the beginning of the collaboration, and get occasional feedback about their performance from the team leader, based on insights gathered from the digital monitoring tool. If the tool shows that progress is blocked in a major way, the team leader will have to call a meeting or otherwise investigate the issue.\n\nThe advantage of this technique is that it scales well. Depending on the task at hand and the sophistication of the monitoring software, one team leader can guide anywhere from 25 to several hundred team members.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-3\">3.3. Agile development</h3>\n\n[TODO]\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-4\">3.4. Project management wiki</h3>\n\n[TODO]\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-5\">3.5. Warroom</h3>\n\nFor some work, \"fast\" will be the first priority within the \"good, cheap, fast\" triangle. A \"warroom\" environment is a technique to get this done with distributed collaborators. Unlike most other techniques, this is synchronous communication: distributed only in space, not in time. It's basically about simulating a busy office environment with a permanent video call, with a few extra features to allow side channel communication, group decision making etc..\n\nThere are disadvantages, of course. Collaborators lose the freedom to work when they choose to, and also the freedom to work from any  place they choose to because a constant video feed requires a high-bandwidth, low-latency Internet connection, making people stuck at home and a few places they know with a reliable connection. So use this sparingly \u2013 only when the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-6\">3.6. Coordinator role</h3>\n\n[TODO]\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-7\">3.7. Information system</h3>\n\nThis is the gold standard for efficient distributed collaboration. Unfortunately, information systems are expensive and time consuming to create and to change, so that only large organizations with few, well-standardized, repetitive processes can reasonably get one. For example, the booking systems of airlines and travel agents. Organizations that do more fuzzy and always slightly different work will have to make do for many aspects of their work with ad-hoc processes based on various, less integrated tools. For example, consider organizations doing consulting and international collaboration / development assistance: compiling and sending a document will always be a manual task, as activities are never standardized enough for the system to know what information to send to whom.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-8\">3.8. Process manuals</h3>\n\nThis is a bit like the technique of [collaborating via an information system](#heading--3-7), but much cheaper, more agile, and applicable to hard-to-automate, ever changing work environments.\n\nInstead of letting computers (and other machines) execute all processes while humans only do data entry, here humans execute the processes according to process manuals. Similar to how an information system is programmed by its software, humans are \"programmed\" with process manuals \u2013 with the huge benefit that they can understand what they are doing, if necessary adapting manual instructions on the go to unforeseen cases.\n\nThis technique is not easy to apply in practice because in general, people hate to RTFM (\"read the friendly manual\"). However, the following tips will help:\n\n* **Write it all down.** Do not expect a collaborator to know how to do a certain thing \"because she's accustomed to our organization's culture by now\". Rather *all* your organizational knowledge must be in your manuals. If it's not there, it should be considered non-existent and your collaborators are right to say that they \"don't know how to do this\".\n\n* **Onboarding course.** People hate reading manuals end-to-end, but there is one moment when an organization can successfully make them do it: when they want to get the job. So after accepting a candidate they would go through a short, week-long paid test period, with an \"entry exam\" at the end. The entry exam can be a multiple choice form with automatic evaluation, where their knowledge of the company processes is checked upon in detail. They would have any amount of time to finish the form, so that they can go to the manuals and look for the relevant information. That hopefully will create a habit that the will stick to later.\n\n* **Onboarding Plan.** Each team should have an onboarding plan template that spans at least 2 weeks for new team members. This should outline the minimum of personal calls and interactions and formulate the most important start information your new team member needs. Give it some thought on how to schedule multiple interactions and how to structure the information that you give to your new team member. Even so, you should have a comprehensive manual somewhere and introduce your new colleague to that, o always only address around 3 new pieces of information in one of those distributed information packages.\n\n* **Personal Connection Calls.** Schedule a 30-60 min personal connection call for new team members at least with their core collaborators and one with the whole team. The goal of those calls is not to get any work done or to explain the structures, but just to communicate the role of each person in the team and to get some background information about the skills and personality of your colleagues. Scheduling and realizing these calls will take up a lot of time in the first few weeks for a new team member and also need time commitment from the colleagues, but in the long run, it will make the collaboration a lot smoother. Make clear that these are not job interviews or evaluations, but save spaces to connect.\n\n* **Answer with links.** People will still ask a lot of questions to IT support and other colleagues that have answers in the manuals \u2013 it's just less effort. But now, the answer can consist of a link to the right manual section and a friendly reminder like \"Did you try to find it in the manual yourself? Do you know why you didn't find it there so that we can improve our manual structure for the future?\". After about six months of this strategy, looking into the manual first will become a habit for most regular collaborators in the organization \u2013 at least that's what we observed when trying to implant similar habits in our organization.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-9\">3.9. Parallel, not fast</h3>\n\nDelays are the single biggest annoyance in distributed collaboration, and even after doing your best to eliminate them, there will always be delays. In part, these delays are inherent in the use of tools for asynchronous communication, and part they result from people using their freedoms to work \"whenever, wherever\". These freedoms are however highly valuable and should be preserved \u2013 in part, they compensate workers for the partial loss of social interaction.\n\nIn total, distributed collaboration is just not good at \"fast\" in the \"fast, good, cheap\" triangle. As the saying goes: you can choose any two, and for distributed collaboration it would be \"good\" and \"cheap\". This means you should avoid ever doing time-critical, tight-deadline work in a distributed organization. If you really *have to* do that, there are some collaboration techniques that support urgent, fast work (like \"[warroom](#heading--3-5)\") sparingly. But it curtails collaborator freedoms, so us these sparingly.\n\nTo achieve a high output, the better alternative to speeding up the work is to rather parallelize multiple non-urgent work streams. This is where distributed collaboration plays its strengths: because the project context in distributed collaboration is much better documented, switching between projects is quite comfortable and fast for a collaborator, making it possible to work on more projects in parallel. With parallel work streams, the always-present delays and waiting times in the communication and collaboration flow of one project don't reduce the overall output, as collaborators will switch over to another project until the first one becomes unblocked again.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--4\">4. Socializing</h2>\n\nWe included tips to make distributed work practices more social into the patterns mentioned under \"Communication\" and \"Collaboration\"; see for example \"[Healthy conference calls](#heading--2-19)\". This chapter however is about techniques that *focus* on socializing and not on productivity and efficiency. In the short term, they may be less productive than not-so-social techniques. Why would we still want them? Humans are social animals \u2013 by varying degree of course, but averaged over a whole workforce it's safe to say that making everyone work in isolation all day long is torture.\n\n[quote]\n:wolf: **A bit of trivia about wolves**\n\nMost people know that wolves are social animals as well \u2013 after all, dogs are basically small wolves, and they are definitely social. But there is also the story of the \"lone wolf\": the rare lupine sociopath, preferring to live and hunt alone. It turns out that this is a myth: \"lone wolves\" are just adults looking for a mate with whom to start their own pack. And packs of wolves are just multi-generational wolf households. And \"alpha male\" and \"alpha female\" wolves are just the oldest wolves of the pack, the parents who started it all. Given how much the \"alpha wolf\" metaphor has been used to justify strictly hierarchical human relationships, it's high time to spread how authority *actually* works among wolves! <!-- TODO: Find and add the source again.-->\n[/quote]\n\n**Socializing in the office.** The socializing aspect of office culture is well established: you can meet at the watercooler or coffee machine for a chat with your colleagues etc.. In literature about workforce management, it is also established knowledge that 20-25% of daily worktime should be deducted for \"non-productive\" activities like socializing in the office and toilet breaks. Still, that time is paid as worktime. It seems that there is a general understanding that, for humans, \"working at 100%\" must include these kind of activities to be a long-term sustainable way of working. They are only superficially \"non-productive\". For short times though, they can be avoided, resulting in work output of more than 100% for a matter of hours or days \u2013 it's just not sustainable or healthy when done on the long term. <!-- TODO: Add a source for this from management literature.-->\n\n**Why is socializing neglected in distributed work?** Unlike in the office, when working remotely there is no watercooler, coffee machine or other social hotspot for meeting your colleagues. It is not too clear why this is the case: Does management consciously or unconsciously consider these activities still as \"unproductive\", now using distributed work practices as a new way to eliminate socializing at work? Or does work culture develop at such a slow pace that it simply has not yet invented the equivalent of a coffee machine for remote work? Or maybe even the coffee machine at work has never been a conscious exercise to support socializing, so that we have a hard time putting the finger on the problem of distributed work practices being anti-social? We will now leave these interesting questions to the social scientists (and to you, if you like to think about them) and move on to solutions \u2026 :blush: \n\n**The economic impacts of socializing.** Making paid worktime available for socializing activities at first sounds like it will negatively impact the financial standing of an organization. However, it is not that simple: if people spend 10% of their time socializing at work it does *not* mean that they will now take (100%)/(100%-10%) = 111% of time to get 100% of their work done. They might get good tips or discover other synergies with co-workers while socializing with them. They might also be happier and more motivated at work, increasing their productivity. They might also have ideas with their co-workers while socializing that generate lots of additional revenue for the company down the line. So in total, allowing for \"paid socializing\" may even have a positive financial impact, but it's very difficult to measure. To cut through this, an organization should just decide to support paid socializing because it makes everyone happier and \"probably\" has no significant impact on the bottom line. After some experimentation, practice will show what forms of socializing are more \"productive\", and then the company can focus on supporting these.\n\n**This is experimental!** The following list provides ideas how to use existing tools in more socially rich ways. This list is much more experimental than the lists of communication and collaboration techniques, as we (Edgeryders) are discovering this area as well. So please be more patient and more careful when trying out these techniques in your organization \u2013 some may not work at all, some may require weeks of experimentation to find out the fine points of how to make an idea workable in practice. As always, your additions and your feedback are very welcome!\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-1\">4.1. Quality time for both work and socializing</h3>\n\n**Offices mix it all together.** In an office setting, the typical approach is to have work and social interaction mixed together all the time, to various degrees. For example, meetings are often used as a more relaxed and slightly fun time compared to individual screen work. Or if a co-worker comes over to your place to ask or discuss a small question, it is often also a bid for your attention to them as a person.\n\n**But mixing is inefficient.** However, these examples also show how mixing individual work and social interaction leads to inefficiencies: meetings are often boring and last longer than they should because some people enjoy talking and receiving attention. And if your colleague interrupts your flow with their little question for three minutes, you may need an additional 15-30 minutes to finish your work as you'll need to get back into the flow first.\n\n**Let's not mix, let's split!** Mixing individual work and social interaction no-matter-what is not good practice. Rather, the principle would be to split time at work into \"mostly work\" and \"mostly social\" activities, as it makes *both* more enjoyable and also more valuable for the organization. This is just the basic idea of course, and you will need a good deal of experimentation to find out how to apply this to your organization. The major challenge is to find low-overhead ways for remote workers to socialize at moments when their activities allow for a natural break \u2013 basically the digital equivalent of the office's coffee machine.\n\n**Our example.** In our organization, even the work in our small office for the core group often looks like the distributed work everyone else in the organization is doing: people staring at screens, not talking at all. At times even using instant messaging with their immediate seat neighbor, to avoid interrupting their flow. That's quality worktime, as it is uninterrupted and without background noise \u2013 it admittedly looks weird, though. In exchange, there are quite some freedoms to socialize during work, usually in the form of extended 1.5-2 hour lunch breaks where nobody insists that people go back to work after the usual one hour break. In total, both the work and the free / unstructured time become more enjoyable. We are however at the beginning of this particular journey ourselves, still experimenting to find the right balance.\n\nThe following sub-sections of this chapter provide more specific ideas for how to provide quality social time at work in a distributed organization.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-2\">4.2. Digital lounge spaces</h3>\n\nThis is a simple and effective way to open up a space for social interaction in distributed work: simply create a dedicated space for it in the digital tools you use:\n\n* **Chat lounge.** Chat or instant messaging tools allow to create separate rooms, and one can be assigned to be the \"lounge\". It would be permanently open to chat alongside work, and people probably would share lighthearted and funny things there.\n\n    Naturally, this lounge would be considered internal communications and not be publicly available on the web. Plus, it can be a good idea to automatically delete all messages older than a certain number of days \u2013 both to discourage misusing the room for \"real work\" that should not be forgotten, and to accommodate people who don't feel comfortable sharing funny or personal stuff when it would go into a permanent record.\n\n* **Forum lounge.** An online forum provides a more structured and less ephemeral way of written communication. A lounge space can be created from both a public or an access protected category, and there are benefits to both approaches. To start activities in this forum lounge, you can take inspiration from long-running threads that serve socializing purposed in Internet forums. <!-- TODO: Include examples, with links, for example a \"what I built today\" thread.-->\n\n* **Audio and video lounge.** In a video conferencing tool, you can assign a certain room name or room number to be permanently available as \"the lounge\". In small organizations, this will probably not be enough for people to bump into each other there, so you can support it further by setting times for organization-wide digital lunch breaks. A lot of ideas can be explored, for example a semi-random grouping of people together into small 3-5 person \"table sized\" calls during lunch, simulating how people typically meet in the office's canteen. Compared to chat and forum, video is the most effortless and most socially rich way of social interaction, so if done right it could provide the best socializing experience in a distributed organization.\n\nSimply knowing that non-work-related interaction, even during worktime, is not just ok but encouraged in these spaces by the organization will help collaborators get over the impression that they would provide a public and permanent display of slacking by including non-work activity in work-related digital spaces.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-3\">4.3. Pair work</h3>\n\nPair programming was invented as a way to improve software quality but also because programmers felt isolated working just with the machine all day. Later, some programmer text editors got  support for real-time collaborative editing, the feature you know from Google Docs. For example, [Atom Teletype](https://teletype.atom.io/). This means that remote pair programming is possible now.\n\nThe principles of pair programming can also be applied to collaborative document writing, in the same room or remotely. This is different \u2013 more social \u2013 than the typical way how Google Docs is used in organizations. Rather than assigning sections to collaborators and then commenting on each other's work, two collaborators write their sections together, connected with an audio call, screen sharing and a collaborative real-time editor like Google Docs. As in pair programming, one person will be the lead: only that person will type, but roles can be reversed after some time. The second person will read, give feedback and ideas, propose improvements, research information, and make the occasional direct edit where this is the fastest way to fix something.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-4\">4.4. Virtual room extension</h3>\n\nYou can connect two distant rooms with a permanent video call as follows: put a video projector on one wall of each connected room, and a camera on that same wall, facing the projector. This will make the room appear larger than it is, with people on the other side, separated just with a \"glass wall\".\n\nThis idea is not suitable for collaborators working from home, but well suitable to connect multiple offices of one organization or to have a large, multi-location party.\n\nTo allow people on different sides of this wall to talk in spite of background noise and without disturbing others much, providing several wireless headsets on each side of the video wall seem to be the most practical approach. You can experiment with variations of this idea, for example headsets for one-on-one talks rather than group talk, perhaps placed on a \"connected table\" that is located at the \"virtual glass wall\" and extends into both connected rooms.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-5\">4.5. Occasional colocation</h3>\n\nBy spending time together at the same place rarely but then for extended periods of time, you avoid 90-95% of business travel and commuting, which is 90-95% of the solution to its greenhouse gas emissions. The benefits of socializing for an extended time last for quite some time into the future, as it allows to establish \"rapport\" with each other, a deeper sense of understanding, interpreting and anticipating each other's behavior and communication. By including more intense and unusual formats from the list below, that rapport can even go much beyond what co-workers in a typical office setting can have.\n\nA list of ideas for how to do \"occasional colocation\" follows \u2013 most of these ideas we tried in our organization, but some are just ideas so far:\n\n* **Presence time.** Temporarily requiring the physical presence of one or some colleagues in the offices of an otherwise distributed company can be very useful. Uses include: \"acclimating\" or \"re-syncing\" these collaborators with the processes and events in the organization; coping with a time of intense workload; and assisting people who struggle with self-organization when working only remotely. In the latter case, the organization might require 20-50% of presence time, for example one fixed day per week in case the colleague lives in the same city anyway. <!-- TODO: Perhaps move that latter point to the \"Building distributed organizations\" chapter.-->\n\n* **Guestroom.** When the organization provides one or more guestrooms at its office location or very close to it, it greatly facilitates the \"presence time\" technique above, and collaborators can also stay around for some time when traveling through the city anyway or being present for an unrelated reason. Ideally, the guestroom would be permanently paid for by the company, or would be available as an unused part of the office. Then, cost and budgets do not have to be considered at all when inviting somebody to stay. When not in use, the guestroom can be rented out on platforms for short-term accommodation, like AirBnB.\n\n* **Retreat.** The whole organization or a core group travels to a nice house in the countryside somewhere and lives together for 5-7 days while also having a lot of meetings, discussions and unplanned time together.\n\n* **Walking retreat.** Like a retreat, but organized as a light hiking trip with 4-6 hours of walking per day plus an extensive lunch break. Walking is a natural way to have conversations in sub-groups of 2-4 people in ever-varying configurations and with natural privacy provided by distance to the rest of the group.\n\n* **Coworking with coworkers.** If colleagues in a distributed organization happen to be in the same city, at least for a time, it's a good opportunity to share time together. Even where that means mostly mostly working alongside each other silently, it creates more of a social connection than working in different places, and thus benefits the future professional relationship of these colleagues. It is also better than just working in a coworking space or caf\u00e9 alongside random strangers, as the social connections developed there do not benefit the worker's organization. Coworking among colleagues can take many forms, depending on what is socially adequate for each context, including: meeting in a co-working space or caf\u00e9 to work there together; meeting at a colleague's flat to work together; working plus a shared meal; stayovers.\n\n* **Coliving with coworkers.** A flat-share community of co-workers, perhaps even with a dedicated workspace inside the flat, provides certainly an intense amount of socializing between some co-workers, compensating for the lack of socializing with co-workers in other cities. It is not unrealistic: three co-workers of Edgeryders O\u00dc have been practicing this for three years in Brussels. It comes with its own challenges though, largely around work / life integration, so they are taking a break from this in 2020 but want to re-group and continue later. To learn more, visit [The Reef's project space](/c/earthos/the-reef).\n\n    Living with your co-workers does not have to be a permanent thing, though. A distributed organization will involve quite some traveling, and whenever that involves colleagues staying in the same city, it is an option to book a multi-room apartment or suite for them rather than individual hotel rooms. Just as living together permanently, this is a [behavior setting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_settings) that promotes socializing, just because you run into each other frequently instead of having to schedule and organize every meetup. It's valuable, and at Edgeryders we made only good experiences with this, so far. It needs a good amount of pre-existing trust between colleagues to be comfortable living together \u2013 so don't push this as an organizational policy, but let the trust develop slowly in other ways, and make sure people know that the company supports temporary co-living even if it increases accommodation costs.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--5\">5. Tools</h2>\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--5-1\">5.1. E-mail: avoid where possible</h3>\n\nE-mail is the one, ancient communication tool that really everyone has, and that widespread adoption makes it valuable: you can shoot an e-mail to anyone, just like that, without installing and learning a new tool first.\n\nHowever, e-mail these days is also a pretty broken system. For example, there is the annoying presence of spam messages, and the risk that your own e-mail will never arrive because spam filters. Also, most people nowadays use [top-posting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posting_style#Top-posting) as their standard reply style, generating a lot of ugly redundancy in e-mail messages. On top of that, e-mail software will either show messages from *all* threads in a single list, or show them as a hierarchically nested thread, requiring complex navigation. Compare this to threads in a modern forum, esp. those in Discourse (also used here on edgeryders.eu) which uses a [semi-flat threading model](https://community.lsst.org/t/150) that makes forum threads look nice and clean.\n\nIn total, we think that e-mail is better avoided wherever possible. In the Edgeryders organization, we even have a no-email policy, applied to all internal communications.\n\nTo wean people off e-mail, here are some tips:\n\n* **E-mail interface in Discourse.** The open source forum software [Discourse](https://discourse.org/) provides extensive support to interact with the forum via e-mail, while providing a nice web interface to everyone who wants to enjoy it. Those who still want to stick to e-mail for a time can (1) receive notifications from the forum in [mailing list mode](https://meta.discourse.org/t/46008), (2) add [replies via e-mail](https://meta.discourse.org/t/14003), by replying to a post notificiation e-mail, (3) create new forum threads (\"topics\") by writing to a certain e-mail address, (4) even participate in a forum discussion purely from e-mail and later, when then are ready to join the forum, their content will be attributed to them when they register an account with their e-mail address. The last feature is called \"[staged users](https://meta.discourse.org/t/107843)\" in Discourse.\n\n* **Discourse as personal mailbox.** If you're feeling adventurous, you could even configure Discourse to get rid of the last few e-mails people send in an e-mail free organization \u2013 namely personal e-mails to people outside the organization. This would work by letting Discourse create a personal message to between a staged user and yourself whenever an e-mail comes in, and then you can reply as usual. We did not try this yet, just had the idea; but if your organization is built around an online forum as its central tool, this certainly makes sense to try.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--5-2\">5.2. Online forum</h3>\n\nUsing an online forum rather than an office building as the center / home base of a company might have been our biggest gamble as Edgeryders. By and large, it worked out. Since 2012, the edgeryders.eu forum, now based on the open source software [Discourse](https://discourse.org/), serves as the central communication and collaboration tool in our organization (see also the [central platform](#heading--6-11) pattern).\n\n<!-- TODO: Finish the part below:\n\nFrom seven years of use, here is what we like and dislike about a forum as an organization's central platform: \n\n**Likes**\n\n* *[TODO]*\n\n**Dislikes**\n\n* *[TODO]*\n-->\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--5-3\">5.3. Shared file storage</h3>\n\n*[TODO]*\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--5-4\">5.4. Collaborative document editing</h3>\n\n*[TODO]*\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--5-5\">5.5. Collaborative list management</h3>\n\nAccording to some people in our organization, collaborative list management software has a huge potential as a lightweight task and project management tool. We have not yet been able to unlock it fully. However, our current favourite tool here is [Dynalist](http://dynalist.io/) and we provide a full manual that documents its use in our organization and our custom modifications and conventions for using it as a task management software in our teams:\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/dynalist-manual/7618\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--5-6\">5.6. Calls and instant messaging</h3>\n\n<!-- TODO: Finish this section, reworking the draft content below.-->\n\n**Calls.** Calls and conference calls are the most direct replacement for business travel and commuting, so this is clearly an important tool. <!-- TODO: Include a comparison of energy efficiency: energy to transfer video feeds vs. energy to transport people.--> In our organization (Edgeryders), we subscribe to Zoom, a state-of-the-art video conferencing service. We provide [our own manual for Zoom](/t/8872).\n\n**Voice messaging.** This is very useful for people who are not made for written but rather for verbal communication. It is also a faster alternative to instant messaging in text. Not many tools support comfortable voice messaging. In our organization [we use Riot](/t/6430) for instant messaging, an open source framework; the Riot mobile app supports voice messaging, but not the Riot web application. WhatsApp supports voice messages well, in both their mobile application and [web application](https://web.whatsapp.com/), but it might not be the best choice in a professional setting :smile:\n\n**Not for permanent content.** In our organization we make a clear distinction between tools for ephemeral and permanent communication. Every tool where content is not archived at all (as in calls and conference calls) or where the archive is such as mess that nobody wants to go in and look for something (as in instant messaging) is assigned the \"ephemeral communication\" label. Everyone is welcome to use these tools freely but posting content there that should be preserved is frowned upon. This content should rather be posted in a high-quality, retrievable form in one of our tools for permanent communication \u2013 in our case the online forum and shared file storage. This practice helps to make quick interactions more efficient (via the ephemeral tools where sloppy usage is ok) while raising the average quality of content posted to the spaces with permanence. For this reason, we are not a big fan of tools that mix both functions, such as Slack \u2013 your mileage may vary.\n\n  &nbsp; To motivate people to not abuse instant messaging for content that is meant to be permanent, it should not be archived. Old messages should be deleted automatically after 2-4 weeks.\n\n**Call recording.** Sometimes, for example when having interviews, recording an audio or video call for later perusal is a very useful feature.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--5-7\">5.7.

Small utilities</h3>\n\n*[TODO]*\n\n<!-- TODO: Write about meeting coordination (Doodle), decision support software (Loomio), etc. -->\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--6\">6. Building distributed organizations</h2>\n\nEvery organization is different, so the above, rather generic tools and techniques will not fit every organization. As an organization developer, you'll have to adapt them, or even invent your own. If you do not have an organization developer in your organization, you can also use distributed collaboration among staff to create processes for distributed collaboration. This is necessarily a complex (as in: self-modifying) process, so be prepared that \"there will be a mess\". If nothing else, a morbid sense of humor helps to get through that time :smile:\n\nThe following sections provide best practices and principles as assistance for designing your own tools and processes for distributed collaboration.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--6-1\">6.1. Use open standards and open source software</h3>\n\nCommercial proprietary solutions that are not based on open standards create vendor lock-in of various kinds, which translate to more friction in distributed collaboration. This is different when using open standards based products, as then there are always multiple tools to choose from, usually including free options and ideally open source options. It is also different for open source software in general, even when it uses its own proprietary file format or communication protocol. This does not create friction, as any collaboration partner can just download and install the tool.\n\n**Example: Graphics file format interchange.** PhotoShop (`.psd`) and Adobe InDesign (`.indd`) files are useless for those who don't have these (expensive) tools to open and modify them. In the case of InDesign, exports to an open source standard format (SVG) are also nearly useless because they contain so many artifacts, object groupings and corner cases that editing these as SVG files with Inkscape is really inefficient and sometimes impossible. Creating everything in SVG from the get-go solves it. This is a good example how using an open standard format from a proprietary tool provides not even half of the desired solution.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--6-2\">6.2. Support Open Source</h3>\n\nThe open source software movement is an exercise in distributed collaboration that, among other things, produces freely available, standards based products for better distributed collaboration. That's the best type of products to use for distributed collaboration, but you also have to support the movement in order to make this a long-term sustainable solution.\n\nYou can support open source in many ways: donate, contribute code, contribute documentation, contribute open source plugins and extensions to the tool's ecosystem, answer questions about an open source tool on Stack Exchange and so on.\n\n<!-- TODO: Elaborate on this more, provide links etc.-->\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--6-3\">6.3. Avoid monopolies</h3>\n\nSometimes there is no efficient enough open source alternative, and then it makes sense to use a commercial product until there is one.\n\nNow when you can't avoid to use a commercial product, try to not choose one supplied by a monopolist or oligopolist supplier \u2013 this especially relates to [GAFAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Four_tech_companies). Such software is the opposite of free, open and open standards based collaboration that is the optimum for distributed organizations with lots of external partners and suppliers. Expect a lot of vendor lock-ins and hidden costs from monopolists.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--6-4\">6.4. Use conventions</h3>\n\nConventions are agreed-on, voluntarily followed best practices to make collaboration more efficient. They help to cut through the vastly different, ambiguous and redundant ways how humans of different cultures express information. Here are some areas for which an organization should probably have conventions in place:\n\n* **Language of communication.** It does not matter in what language people in your organization *talk*, as long as it is a common language. However, any permanent communication (files etc.) should be in the same language as much as possible, because remixing and combining useful older materials becomes quite impossible otherwise.\n\n* **Calendar system.** The Gregorian calendar is still far from the only one in use worldwide. For example, Nepal has three calendar systems in parallel use (AD, BS, Newar<!-- TODO: links-->). But one organization should only use one!\n\n* **Date format.** We propose to settle on the `yyyy-mm-dd` [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) date format, the only international standard for a date format. Also it is a beautiful and logical one, and when used in filenames it let's you sort them by date using your normal file manager application.\n\n* **Time zone format.** In our experience, time zone abbreviations (\"EST\") or names (\"Eastern Standard Time\") are useless, as most recipients will need digital tools to figure out what a meeting time is in their own timezone. Giving multiple times using city names (\"Berlin time\") of major cities in the recipients' area is more intuitive.\n\n* **Time zone use.** In truly global distributed organizations, it will be simpler to give all appointment times in [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time), the worldwide standard time zone. Collaborators would then use two clocks in parallel, one displaying local time and one displaying UTC. Where smartphones, tablets or computer screens are used as watches, this is simple to do with small software applications (\"widgets\").\n\n<!-- TODO: More list items.-->\n\n\n#### <h3 id=\"heading--6-5\">6.5. Standardize</h3>\n\nStandards are different from conventions in that conventions are voluntarily followed best practices but standards are enforced in the organization. Use this more drastic measure more sparingly to preserve individual freedoms. But definitely use them where the benefits outweigh the price to pay (which is, fewer degrees of freedom). Examples include:\n\n* **Software development technologies.** There is a large amount of redundancy between competing software technologies: many of them do exactly the same, but in a different way. And mastering a new programming language, framework, package manager or other programming tool always is a major amount of \"unproductive\" time. So by all means possible, make sure that the different software tools that you develop or modify in your organization use the same technologies as much as possible. It does not matter for software that you will only install but never adapt in your organization.\n\n<!-- TODO: Complete the list of examples.-->\n\n\n#### <h3 id=\"heading--6-6\">6.6. Use agile design principles</h3>\n\n*[TODO]*\n\n<!-- TODO: List and explain the 10 principles of agile design in manufacturing. This comes from industry, but will also help eliminating friction in any form of collaboration.-->\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--6-7\">6.7. Eliminate wait states</h3>\n\nWaiting for required input from another party is the worst possible friction of collaboration in general. This might be especially true for distributed collaboration: wait times might be longer here, as the lack of presence and interaction provides fewer cues that would serve as reminders to get something done in time.\n\nThere is a great and already somewhat dated example about a technique called \"Xtreme Collaboration\", invented and practiced at NASA in their Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) for space mission planning. It combines a three-week preparation tmime and a four-hour co-located session together with digital tools into a technique that is very effective at eliminating wait states. It also required minimal presence \u2013 for one space mission, just one afternoon in the \"warroom\" meeting environment.<!-- TODO: Add links.-->\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--6-8\">6.8. Educate and hire distributed collaboration experts</h3>\n\nThis manual might seem like a long collection of rules to follow. That is not the case: these are best practices that one would follow voluntarily in order to (collectively) unlock great, enjoyable distributed collaboration in an organization. They will only appear as rules to those who don't understand why these are _best_ practices \u2013 that is, to the novice.\n\nSo to support voluntary and enthusiastic adoption of these best practices, invest into educating all collaborators of the organization to become more and more experts in distributed collaboration.\n\nOne added benefit is: the expert is somebody who can break the rules. Because the expert knows what will happen when doing that, they can achieve efficiencies beyond what rules can make possible. Because rules are always oversimplifying and generalizing, leaving some latent efficiency untapped. And if only efficiency in worktime by knowing when it's ok to cut corners and be more sloppy in applying \"the rules\".\n\n<!-- TODO: Give examples of how experts can break the rules.-->\n\nWhen you are about to hire new people anyway, it is of course advisable to hire those who are already at an expert level in distributed collaboration. It's the skill of the future, when air travel will be hopefully highly taxed and rationed. There is no formal qualification in distributed collaboration yet, so when hiring, you will have to check for \"proxy indicators\". For example, several years of distributed work experience would be a plus, for example working in customer support or remote IT support. Still, it is hard to know if a candidate is experienced in good or bad work practices of distributed work. So a better indicator could be when somebody has been a regular contributor to amateur open source projects for years. Because here, money is no motivator, and people drop out if they don't enjoy the work for what it is.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--6-9\">6.9. Hack your tools</h3>\n\nHacking means using a product beyond what it was originally designed and made for. Often, hacks are a combination of small changes to the technology and conventions on how to use it. A usage convention for software can itself be a hack.\n\nSuch hacks make changes to software tools cheaper and faster. Adapting software to an organization's needs is difficult (for open source software) or impossible (for commercial products). It requires access to the source code, technical expertise in the particular software development stack that the tool uses, takes time and patience and repeated testing, and it can become expensive. Hacks are cheaper and faster and often provide a good enough solution, or at least a way to test a new function before deciding to get it properly implemented or not.\n\nExamples:\n\n* **TODO markers.** Let's say your online forum software does not have a feature to create tasks for editors or for your future self to a draft text. A hack to \"create\" this feature is simply to start each to-do item with a marker string only used for that purpose, such as \"@TODO\". This way, you can get a good overview by searching for that string in the document \u2013 the web browser will show how many to-do items are there and let you navigate through them with the \"Find Next\" function (often on <kbd>F3</kbd>). At least Chrome also shows where the to-do items are found, by means of small colored lines in the scrollbar. And when you add attention-catching formatting to the to-do items, such as red text color, you have a quick way of visually navigating between to-do items by scrolling through the document.\n\n* **Table of Contents.** Markdown does not provide a table of contents feature. But as you can see above, this manual (which is written using Markdown) has a table of contents. We just created it from more basic building blocks, with additional tools external such as `pandoc`.<!-- TODO: Elaborate on this more. Link to the manual about it. -->\n\n* **Use Good Metaphors.** In digital spaces names and methophors can be key. Metaphors allow us to communicate athmospheres and \"vibes\", which is something virtual comunication especially is in need of. Addtionally it allows us to decrease technical jargon. Deliberately use parallels like for example *\"Virtual Room Temperature\"* to describe the intended or perceived atmosphere of a meeting. If you think of a temperature scale from 0 to 30 it is intuitive that below 15 is too cold (un-personal), above 25  is too hot (too much pressure), and that we should aim for a comfortable 20 which is slightly above the middle. It is a useful shorthand to communicate a complex balancing act. The right name for your chat could make a difference as well. People behave differently in the *\"All Team Chat\"* than in the *\"Lunch Break\"*. As stated before, many of our learned social cues do not work in virtual spaces, but the right metaphor can help us to *bridge that intuitive gap*. ;)\n\n<!-- TODO: More list items.-->\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--6-10\">6.10. How to choose a collaboration tool</h3>\n\n**Know the price.** Every new tool that you introduce to your organization creates long-term obligations for user support, security updates and other updates and possibly paying for necessary extensions. Not to mention licence costs in case of commercial tools. So, choose your tools wisely, and limit the number of tools. Before settling for a completely new, standalone tool, check if any of your existing tools can be extended with a plugin or hack (see above).\n\n**Dealing with friction between tools.** Another disadvantage of too many tools is that it becomes impossible to have an integrated, coherent communication. There is always friction when bringing different tools together. For example, there will not be a search function that looks through both a forum and chat platform \u2013 such friction is acceptable only if a new tool is still a net benefit when adding it to your existing toolkit. But when you already have 100 collaboration tools around, every new tool will be so similar to an existing one that the added friction will outweigh its benefits.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--6-11\">6.11. Have a central platform</h3>\n\nPreferably, one of the tools would be the central communication platform, and the other tools the periphery. At Edgeryders, we use [Discourse](https://discourse.org/) as our central platform, and we love it for that purpose.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--6-12\">6.12. How to introduce a collaboration tool</h3>\n\nOnce you found a tool to solve a collaboration challenge, your challenge is to get people to use it, and to use it properly. We made experience that patience pays off. It took us about six months to introduce our own instant messaging platform, during which time we had to constantly remind our collaborators to not use Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp etc. and also to not abuse our chat platform for long-form or complex content, which should rather go into our existing forum.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--6-13\">6.13. Get your incentives right</h3>\n\nEfficient distributed collaboration requires certain behaviors that provide no immediate, personal benefit and thus often need extra encouragement.\n\nFor example, most people hate writing or maintaining documentation for this reason. In response, you could either try to find and hire the rare person who loves writing documentation, or experiment with incentives. For example, [Stack Overflow](https://stackexchange.com/) pioneered a type of Q&A sites where documentation authors are rewarded with \"reputation\". They also [offer this](https://stackoverflow.com/teams) as an internal tool for organizations, and it might be the right tool for some types of larger organizations.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--6-14\">6.14. Make your own tools, but sparingly</h3>\n\nFor cases where you cannot find an existing tool that suits your needs and you also cannot adapt or [hack an existing tool](#heading--5-9) to fit your requirements, you can also build you own software tools for use in your organization. This should however be the last option, because it also contributes to tech legacy of an organization:\n\n* A custom tool will require constant maintenance and adaptation to stay fit for its purpose, to adaptto organizational changes, and to adapt to technological changes of Internet technology.\n\n* A custom tool has to be of good software quality to actually improve collaboration. If it just supports some custom workflows but with a lot of errors and crashes, it may be better to keep using a generic off-the-shelf tool in spite of its inefficiency.\n\nAfter you decided to build a custom software tool, its software architecture and design (the choice of technology and exact feature set) is the next challenge. This is not the place to treat this, though.\n\n<!-- TODO: Finish and include the following section:\n\nHere are some best practices we found as a small to medium sized businesses for good software architecture and design of custom tools:\n\n* **Don't fracture your IT environment.** You want internal IT skills to be re-usable, so standardize the front-end JavaScript framework to use, the CSS framework to use, the serverside programming language and framework, and the mobile application framework and languages.\n\n* \u2026\n-->\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--6-15\">6.15. Become an office-free organization</h3>\n\nThis is one of the clearest but also most extreme ways to support distributed collaboration in your organization: become a completely virtual, office-free organization.\n\nThe idea is here that office-free collaboration is a [behavior setting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_settings) that constantly pushes collaborators towards better practices of distributed work.\n\nIn particular: *having* an office means that walking over to a colleague is a more comfortable and slightly faster way to communicate, compared to written communication. Due to that, it will be a default mode of office communication, and it will be hard to root this out. As a result, colleagues who do not work in this office will find the information shared with them in files and in writing incomplete, which makes their own work more frustrating. The same applies when an organization has multiple offices that work together: information sharing between offices will never be complete enough. But when everyone works distributedly by default, everyone has the same incentive to make distributed work efficient and enjoyable.", "created_at": "2019-10-25 15:48:29.979725", "updated_at": "2020-11-26 02:40:54.543550", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 19874, "wiki": true, "reads": 79, "score": 18715.8, "like_count": 9, "reply_count": 5, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [39045], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 4022, 5, 5083, 5485, 428, 4934, 8, 1877], "is_private": false}, {"id": 36199, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 6811, "post_number": 28, "raw": "Your naming convention proposal is a bit unclear.

The system should be scalable and be capable of enhancement with an array of different sensors (water and gas consumption, solar production, etc).\n\nWe could also think of adding a weather station.\n\nThe most appropriate solution for enabling us to do this is the <a href=\"http://www.openenergymonitor.org/\">OpenEnergyMonitor</a> project, an end-to-end open-source energy monitoring system. It is Arduino / Raspberry compatible and composed of four key components: \n\n* **emonBase:** this board collects the readings received wirelessly from sensor nodes. There is a RFM12Pi expansion board which can be plugged into a Raspberry Pi. The data can then be uploaded to an external web site (emoncms) and / or stored on an external harddrive connected to the raspberry (for local use).\n\n* **emonTx:** is the main sensor node. It usually sits next to the electricity meter box and measures electricity being used or generated via clip on CT (Current Transformer) sensors. In addition to CT based electricity monitoring the emonTx has a pulse counting input which can be used for interfacing with smart meters and certain types of water meters. It also has a DS18B20 digital temperature sensing input which supports multiple DS18B20 temperature sensors on a single bus.\n\n* **emonTH:** The emonTH is a long lasting, easy to deploy wireless temperature and humidity sensing node designed for use in building thermal performance monitoring. The emonTH is powered by 2x AA batteries and is available with a choice of either DS18B20 based temperature sensing or DHT22 based Temperature and Humidity sensing. An external DS18B20 temperature sensor can then be easily wired into a screw terminal connector to provide external temperature readings.\n\n* **emonGLCD:** The emonglcd is a table top LCD display that is ideal for showing information such as current power consumption in an at-a-glance fashion. The display is a standard 128px by 64px LCD and so is fully programmable. The standard firmware can either show a simple home energy monitor style display or a solar pv import vs export display with ambient LED's that glow green when a household is exporting and red when importing.", "created_at": "2014-02-14 17:21:38", "updated_at": "2017-10-26 15:07:15.257457", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 373, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 112.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 84403, "user_id": 1450, "topic_id": 14460, "post_number": 25, "raw": "I'd like to join!", "created_at": "2020-10-05 17:43:49.008907", "updated_at": "2020-10-05 17:43:49.008907", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 5, "wiki": false, "reads": 21, "score": 44.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 6670], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2787, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 2754, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<span>Well,<a href=\"http://www.css.ethz.ch/publications/pdfs/CAD-61-62.pdf\"> two very interesting articles</a> just came out on the <span>Caucasus Analytical Digest</span>.</span>\n\n<span>Summary of the two articles:</span>\n\n<span>\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7f738b02e25499eb355fc4030113dac8ca4e3e9c.png\" width=\"394\" height=\"352\"><br></span>\n\n<span>--</span>\n\n<span>\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/4/488b35f39b7cd65371ee54c8f0f52d446a33331a.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"380\"><br></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-17 11:10:47", "updated_at": "2017-10-04 11:32:05.582806", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 175, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10248, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 1321, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>What or who supports your European citizenship?</b>\n\nHey Chara, thanks for sharing your ryde with us!\u00a0 AIESEC, ERASMUS.. this seems like a lot of hooking up with people your age and diverse interests.

Edgeryders learns from these agents, in order to come up with policies to thrive and grow further.\n\n## Rationale\n\nEconomists, politicians and business leaders, it seems, have given up on trying to imagine completely different economic systems. But we have not. And neither has a small group of brainy, visionary science fiction authors: Cory Doctorow (peer production and abundance in  *Walkaway*  ), Bruce Sterling (nomads + cheap open source technology + reputation servers in  *Distraction*  ), Neal Stephenson (phyla in  *The Diamond Age*  ), Peter Watts (tons of insights from biology in the  *Rifters*  trilogy), and others. We organize a meeting of minds where we can learn from each other what future economies might look like. And maybe even how we can help bring them into the world\n\n\n**Academia, tied down in publish or perish, is uninterested: we need a new space.**  So, we have partnered with  **[EIT Climate-KIC ](https://www.climate-kic.org/)** , the European Union\u2019s largest climate innovation initiative. Together, we are organizing a  **Science Fiction Economics Lab**  , to bring together SF authors, economists, technologists, activists and just ordinary citizens who care, like us, to to envision different economic systems. We are not interested in tweaks, one percentage point of budget deficit more or less. By \u201cdifferent\u201d we mean  *radically*  different. And these systems need to be  *rock solid*  , not some kind of delusional fantasy good for another round of electoral promise.\n\n**With this effort we are working to co-create a template for re-energizing society\u2019s capacity for designing paradigm-level reform** ; help raise the awareness of the climate crisis as a carrier of opportunity and hope, and not just of disruption and dismay; and embolden would-be reformers. This space is what we are inviting you to get involved.

Having a presence in the city can potentially grow an engagement network of these initiatives and the locals.\n\n**Cons**:\n\n* possible complications in renting or leicincing (I guess it's a dream site for many but had been abandoned for many many years).\n* Hurghada is the fastest growing city in terms of building development (real-estate) and a shrinking city in terms of population because of the tourism crisis.... many foreigners and Egyptians from other cities are abandoning Hurghada after the loss of their businesses so the city is facing a hard socio-economic situation.\n\nThoughts and other ideas are welcome :slight_smile:", "created_at": "2017-09-12 11:39:33.933757", "updated_at": "2017-10-25 15:41:34.632760", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 647, "wiki": false, "reads": 29, "score": 350.8, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3729, 5, 2095, 1935, 4101, 251], "is_private": false}, {"id": 61461, "user_id": 4779, "topic_id": 11016, "post_number": 6, "raw": "Ahoj, to je dobr\u00e1 ot\u00e1zka, v\u011b\u0159\u00edm v\u0161ak tomu, \u017ee i v \"chud\u0161\u00edch\" spole\u010dnostech m\u016f\u017ee existovat obecn\u011b citliv\u011bj\u0161\u00ed vtah k vlastn\u00edmu \u017eivotn\u00edmu prost\u0159ed\u00ed.

What we were taught as undergraduates is that V is a parameter. In the short run, it can be treated as a constant one. This is the basis for Friedman's claim that all a central bank must do is increase the money in such a way that there is not \"too much\" of it affecting price levels. Less HFT, that would mean \"if the production of goods and services increases by 5%, increase money supply by 5%\". The production of goods and services If this is true:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>I can't interpret your claim that V does not affect price levels. Of course it is technically true, but then it is true also of my hemoglobine count. Parameters don't affect anything.</li>\n\n<li>If you deflate GDP by the increase of money supply in a perfect Friedmanian world you get this ratio GDP/M is a constant. An interpretation of this could be that the Friedmanian Central Bank is doing its job well. What gives? What is causing what?</li>\n\n<li>Plus, I don't recall the TOTAL quantity of money was ever the unit of measure of GDP. GDP is measured in monetary\u00a0<em>units,</em>\u00a0which (if you believe the welfare economy theorems) are more or less bottled happiness (\"utility\"). If you don't like that, look at GDP in PPPs, or in Big Macs, and you will still get an increasing time series.</li>\n\n</ol>As for your thought experiment, I do not know how to handle it for two reasons.\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>it either rejects the Friedman-Fisher world \u00a0altogether, making V perfectly flexible, or is using a very long time scale to make it so. Either way, it has little to say about the world described by standard economics.</li>\n\n<li>The price of the tool is fixed by construction, so of course it cannot vary.</li>\n\n</ol>Finishing this rant off, Sen and Stiglitz forgive me, I am no fan of GDP. But it does correlate pretty well with other time series measuring pysical things, like employment. There must be something there.\u00a0\n\nOne thing that does make sense to me is this: you seem to advocate a more sophisticated model, in which V is different in different parts of the economy. A dual model might suffice: finance and everything else. The duality is interesting because V can be assumed to be constant in the non-finance sector, but variable in the finance sector. What happens in such a world? Frankly, I have no idea.\n\nI will be happy to read the paper.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-21 17:49:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:11.044230", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 459, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62543, "user_id": 5347, "topic_id": 11244, "post_number": 7, "raw": "Svaka ti je na mestu.

Put the community at the center since the beginning.**\n\nDuring our kickoff meeting in Berlin (January 2019) we were, thanks to @matthias already able to use the discourse platform, and together we committed to use it and familiarize during the kick-off. This was painful and my feeling is that after that experiment not all the partners felt comfortable on using it in the following months, also the activities were reduced at that time.\n\nBut because the platform was there we were able to engage with it and one decision that was taken was to have some sort of interaction in it mandatory for everybody that was interested on participating to the school.\n\nIt\u2019s again raising the bar for someone that want to participate and \u201cit didn\u2019t make the call so open\u201d, but at the same time we thought that the discourse platform will be the place where all this people will meet, and why don\u2019t start since the beginning to meet to each other?\n\nIn the form for the application there was then a request for the link of your \u201cpresentation\u201d comment on the platform\n2. This little trick [created this](https://community.trustinplay.eu/t/stories-from-the-world-of-urban-play/117/) **a thread of 212 posts so far**, with stories coming in from all around the world, interactions between the applicants, with a visible immediate value for everyone that landed there.\n\nYou can read it though the conversations that are naturally happening.\n\nSome of the applicants figured out that in order to stand out they have to start a new thread and this is interesting too, it means that there is a familiarity with the tech that this little choice was able to enhance.\n**3. The number of complete application that we received is high**, -we were expecting half of it-, and the quality is also really high (I didn\u2019t look at all of them yet but at first screening everyone put a lot of work in it), the Nomad branch received 54,3% of it, the Athens branch 32,1% and the Amsterdam branch 13,6%. \nAmsterdam has a 1/3 selection ratio which is enough to have astonishing Trainees.\n**4. As Nomad branch we used 2 main strategy to communicate the call**, but I have the feeling that the result was more organic then driven by those.\n\nFirst we mapped a lot of community that were connected with our topic and we shared the call but then, and I think this was a key feature of the open call, we organized two webinars, i.e. conversation with guests artists around topic that could be interesting for the Trainee that we are engaging.\n\nThe [first one](https://community.trustinplay.eu/t/webinar-16th-of-may-money/231) was about money and sustainability, the [second](https://community.trustinplay.eu/t/invitation-second-webinar-festivals-and-communities-27th-of-may/230) about festival and community.\n\nFor the first one we had 30 people registered to the event and a presence of 20 guests during the webinar, for the second the number of registration rises to 48 but the number of people present was around 25. The good news though was that a lot of the creatives that were present the second time were not present the first time.\n\nWebinars are not easy to attend, you have to stick to a certain time and topic, but all the feedback that we\u2019ve received where really positive, and personally, I believe that sharing curated contents for free, is a feature that will define the kind of school we want to be and will attract the students that we want to have and the organizations that we want to work with.\n\n\nSo to sum up:\n\n* Community first\n\n* Sharing free content immediately\n\n* Put your face out :)\n\nNow the call is closed and we will select a small number of trainee though ;( and we are scared that this value that we have will got lost because:\n\n* a) we are not structured to do community management (there is no money in the budget for it and this is not the short term goal of the project, but could be a long term goal)\n\n* b) the open call was the main reason because the applicants got involved so if they are not selected what could keep them interacting to each other? Or will they interested on it?\n\nDid you see some possible solution?\n\nLuckily for me I\u2019m in good company: for three days I will spend time with @johncoate in northern California so we are going to talk about it but I feel that all of you have a lot of stories about it that could help us going in one direction that is better for the designers that shared their story with us.\n\nThanks!", "created_at": "2019-06-02 18:00:37.902496", "updated_at": "2019-06-02 18:00:37.902496", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 971, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 110.6, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 3, 1856, 4725, 4934], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21705, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 3941, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Not that many changes</b>\n\nAnnotator will be more or less a drop-in replacement for eComma's own little JavaScript library.

People to invite\n\nTopic list:\n\nExamples:\n\n* Data sovereignty:\n  * Digital Autonomy.\n  * How do you maintain the freedom of your own data\n  * How do you keep your password save\n* GDPR and what it means for teachers! (as a entry door into the topic)\n  * How do you deal with other people's data?\n* Subscriber to your life?...Ingrown subscriptions. Which programs do you learn to use?\n  * Dependence on subscription software\n  * A divided society - subscribers vs owners.\n  * A divided society - consumers vs creators.\n  * A divided society - \u201cfree and capable\u201d vs \u201censlaved and incapable\u201d\n* Understanding the language of terms and conditions\n* Do you own your money?\n\nFelix story of speaking to an IT involved teacher:\n\nSpontaneously met a headmaster of a small school in Germany.\n\nThat person was part of the team (12 persons) developing the IT curriculum for schools for that federal state (for age ~10-16 yrs). Before that he ran a company equipping schools with hard and software and providing workshops. (probably one week workshops on what to teach and how to teach in IT following that federal states informatics curriculum). (open source honey:). (you can apparently finance and engage with beekeeping for teachers currently, as that is a projects many schools or teachers would like to install))\n\nThe demand for such workshops is very high. More than are provided. The teachers feel that they can not provide the skills for good IT teaching, as there is always some pupils ahead of them.\n\nWhat do you think about developing a paid workshop offer for teachers to use open source software?\n\n(open hive: http://openhivescale.org/ , but apparently there are multiple projects: https://www.osbeehives.com/collections/source-files , \u2026 )\n\n* YES! Positive professional pressure\n* YES! Sustainability of the project!\n\nAnother set of workshops:\n\nThese could be such concrete (practical) offers for teachers.\n\n* Monitoring your beehive with open source software and hardware.\n* Automatically watering your flower with open source software.\n* Run your own cloud on open source software.\n\nThere are different forms of workshops:\n\nDevelopment and Offer Workshops.\n\n> next development workshop will help to develop strategy for offer workshops\n\n> offered workshops are \u201coffered to schools and teachers\u201d\n\nLinks:\n\nhttps://scratch.mit.edu/\n\nhttp://openhivescale.org/\n\nhttps://www.media.mit.edu/people/mres/overview/ (john can connect us to those people)\n\nWho do we need to contact/invite?\n\n(concrete names!)   \n\n# This is a Wiki post.

So, if the Messina project is an example of evasive entrepreneurship, if it is being held up as an example to emulate one would have to show that is is productive. And yes, it could be built around any ideology or none -- I just picked leftist in my question because it seemed more likely.\n-Any business that does not make money dies -- generally pretty soon. So yes -- it is absolutely materialistic -- but as Adam Smith points out in 1776, a business that succeeds by making money for its founder in a free market must by definition be providing something that people are willing to part with their hard-earned money for, so they are voting  with their money that it's beneficial to them. And yes, this of course applies to all kinds of illegal and immoral activities as well as ones we find uplifting, because there are humans involved. But I am straying... Replacing humans with machines literally began with the industrial revolution -- weaving machines replacing skilled weavers in the UK in the early 19th century led to the \"Luddite\" movement that smashed factory technology. There are two factors involved here that are in conflict with each other: one is that the new technology is more efficient and therefore increases the productivity of the industry -- more product at less cost. Downside is that previous workers get thrown out to starve. The secret to this conflict is that THE MACHINES ALWAYS WIN -- who can resist paying less for the same product? So the only realistic way to solve this problem in a humanistic way would be to tax the industry of part of its increased productivity (Bill Gates calls this a \"tax on technology\") and use it to fund re-training for workers whose skills have become obsolete. Because the worst possible response is to try to prevent workers from being laid off -- this just leads to you having an industry with expensive obsolete technology that cannot compete with other places that have the newer more productive stuff. And even if you are REALLY stupid and prevent those other places from selling their better, less expensive stuff to your country, you end up in a downward spiral of unproductivity -- and of course this is precisely what unites Mr Trump and Emmanuel Macron, whom I otherwise admire... which is also another discussion.\n-Yes, economics is, as I like to say, a branch of social psychology -- but that's not entirely true -- it mostly sounds cool -- what is more true is that macroeconomics is a branch of cultural anthropology; in other words, it is the institutions of culture that determine how humans interact in the economic sphere -- there is no doubt that this also includes a great deal of what we call \"social psychology\", which is again a branch of ethology, which is the study of animal behavior under natural conditions... Behavioral economics is exemplified by the work of economics Nobelist Daniel Kahnemann (who is a social psychologist), and some others: Dan Ariely, Dan Pink -- all of whom have TED talks, because the idea that economics is *really* psychology appeals to a lot of TED-talk people. And I mock it because I mock everything, but actually I have a lot of respect for what they have accomplished. And as for someone who has looked at economics from a cultural perspective... The first was Thorstein Veblen in his 1899 book \"The Theory of the Leisure Class\", which I VERY highly recommend. It includes all the flaws and personal foibles one might expect from an anthropology-oriented book written in that era by a dandy with Veblen's idiosyncrasies, and it still is a tour de force -- nothing else compares.The other one I know of is David Graeber's books, starting with the 2001 Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value, passing through Debt: The First 5000 Years and as of 2018 \"Bullshit Jobs\". Graeber is always interesting and thought-provoking and pre-conceived-opinion-exploding, though he is an anarchist and much too left-wing for my opinion of what is advisable and workable in the modern world. There is a whole pretty mainstream \"school\" of \"Institutional economics\" founded by Veblen. Nobelist Elinor Ostrom is my favorite -- she is the other non-economist who won a Nobel in economics -- she studied political theory, but ended up designing communities and the local management of local natural resources -- I highly recommend her eight Principles for Common Pool Resource institutions. Sounds vaguely Buddhist...\n\nHey, Alberto! Maybe Ostrom could be a focus for a scifi econ project -- although she attracts a lot of  airy-fairy community-oriented folks who don't have the rigor she brought to her studies which made her so well-respected.", "created_at": "2020-05-20 05:07:25.879281", "updated_at": "2020-05-20 05:11:53.312475", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 822, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 13.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [76870], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 47288, "user_id": 4664, "topic_id": 9029, "post_number": 1, "raw": "**Who am  I ?**\nSyrine bouslama, from Sousse Tunisia , Data scientist and Epitomi co-founder.\n\n\n**Why did I start working on Epitomi?** \nSince my early age, I was fascinated by new technologies especially the magic of robots and electronic devices. This is why I have oriented early my career to become an electronic engineer.\n\nDuring my years of study, I was disappointed of the way most of my friends and classmates choose their education and career path : they choose their studies without taking in consideration their passion neither the trend of the labor market and most of them end up by being depressed and not finding a suitable job for them . Also, I noticed how many people seeking vocational retraining and I believed even more in the hypothesis that professional orientation needs urgent intervention. \n\nThis is so problematic in our country since we have been taught to be engineers or doctors to have a respectful social status and be able to make a good leaving .\n\nBut aren't we are not we living in a world with a endless possibilities and an abundant numbers of opportunities ? so can we we can take a leaving and follow our passion ?\n\nSince my graduation I started asking these questions, how is it possible to help people find the right path in their education and career while following their passion and taking into consideration their personalities? So I ended up concluding that this problem is a combination between the tunisian mentality mind and the lack of pedagogical guidance and support that can help young people through the process of orientation and raise their awareness about making the right choice to choose their careers so we can prevent the next generation of being passive and unmotivated. \n\n**How to address this problem ?** \n\nDriven by my desire to change things around me and serve my community while working on things that I love and believe in, I started looking for solutions to help young people better choose their education while taking into consideration their passion and the evolution of the label market . This is how I started working on Epitomi: an intelligent platform that offer a customized assistance for young people to better choose their career path and education and raise awareness about employment in the future.\n\n**Our ambition**\n\nMy ambition is to make Epitomi an intelligent platform that is able to recommend careers and education paths and guide young minds to a better future. We can achieve that for the users by gathering all the information about private and public universities and training centers. I would love to make it easy for people having difficulties finding the career which best suits them to choose a job that matches their profile and personality and get well prepared to the professional world.\n\n**Where are we now?**\n\nWith the help of a psychiatrist specialized in university orientation, we have developed a set of questions to feed our bot. In this test phase, the analysis of the users answers will be done manually. Later, this collected data will  then be used as a database to train our chat bot (as you may know to train a model we need a huge amount of data). \nI developed myself the mvp of our Epitomi chatbot on messenger and now we are focused on testing it on real bachelor students. So, we launched a Facebook page and we are doing our best to make people discover our product so we can have their feedback about the effectiveness and the need of our service.\n\n**Next step?**\n\nWe had an agreement in principle with a student network implanted in more than 25 university institutions to test our chatbot and this will help us evaluate the relevance of the questions and see if the analysis of the answers will be a good starting point to build a training data set.\n\n**Want to join Epitomi ?**\n\nSince Ameni and I, the cofounders, are both engineers, we welcome people who want to join to help in marketing and community building. \nWe really appreciate if there are community members who had similar experience with chatbots and collecting text data to share with us their experience and how they managed to collect data. \nWherever you are, if you feel like we do need such a solution in your country let\u2019s have a chat!", "created_at": "2018-09-13 17:07:09.243914", "updated_at": "2018-09-14 09:11:23.906006", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 722, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 808.2, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3703, 5, 4, 2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 84430, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 14531, "post_number": 9, "raw": "Yeah, tone is something we also talked about.

Naravno, generacije u\u010denika bi razumele na\u010dine dono\u0161enja odluka i samu su\u0161tinu demokratski ure\u0111enog dru\u0161tva. \n\u0160ta je ideja? \nVe\u0107 sam imao kontakt (dodu\u0161e pre 2 godine) sa gimnazojm Branko Radi\u010devi\u0107 u Staroj Pazovi kojoj se dopala ideja, te sam 2 puta prisustvovao sednicama Parlamenta, obavio nekoliko razgovora sa pedagogom i profesorima. Radili smo i neku anketu... Sve u svemu, ljudi su voljni za saradnju.\nIdeja:\n - izraditi platformu (sli\u010dnu ovoj) gde \u0107e mo\u0107i da se glasa o pojedinim predlozima i gde se tako\u0111e javno su\u010deljavaju mi\u0161ljenja i predlozi, problemi, ideje... To treba dobro smisliti i sa tehni\u010dke strane, mislim programerske. Taj deo ne razumem ba\u0161. :slight_smile: \n  - kroz edukaciju (recimo neke radionice) i rasprave i na sednicama i preko platforme, do\u0107i do nekog modela kako da funkcioni\u0161e Parlament. Kako se predlog stavlja na dnevni red? Koja je procedura do glasanja? Ko i kako se uklju\u010duje u akcije koje ho\u0107e da  se realizuju? Koje sve odbore/organe treba da ima Parlament? Da li treba neki kru\u0107i model organizovanja ili ne\u0161to kao \"lean\" struktura? To treba re\u0161avati i pre i za vreme trajanja projekta.\n   - Omogu\u0107iti u\u010denicima da se bave nekim socijalnim preduzetni\u0161tvom ili bilo kakvim preduzetni\u0161tvom bi bilo veoma dobro. Od ekologije do IT-a. \n\n Ovo je u grubim crtama i ostavljeno je dosta prostora za konkretizaciju.\nKome je interesantna tema neka pi\u0161e i pita \u0161ta god, po\u0161to ne bih sad od jednom sve da ispucam.  ;)", "created_at": "2019-12-04 18:19:08.258299", "updated_at": "2019-12-04 18:19:08.258299", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 354, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 32.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5347], "is_private": false}, {"id": 70629, "user_id": 5485, "topic_id": 12741, "post_number": 1, "raw": "![Atrium|690x460](upload://aMvjWRSahjMJFPqTBqUIUkYwaCw.jpeg) \n**Location:** Atrium", "created_at": "2020-02-26 17:02:39.573747", "updated_at": "2020-02-26 17:50:46.086812", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 7, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 41.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}]
