The main difference here being that Output was a 1 day festival. \n\nThe date range mentioned above (25th-31st) covers 6 days but up until now we've always talked about 3 days. This merits further discussion/clarification. Financially it makes sense to make the festival longer of course and I personally prefer that as well. Allows for more depth and less FOMO.

With that said, I am curious what we would provide for 1500 SEK.\n[/quote]\n\nWell, I personally wouldn't go and see those bands even if someone *paid me* 1200 SEK.  Even less so standing knee deep in mud on a field outside of Roskilde (I also went there in 2003 - a complete waste of time). And 2006 was 14 years ago. :)\n\n(OK, maybe The Streets then. And Guns and Roses, but only on the condition that it also included time travel to the early 90's. And if we're already doing time travel I would have agreed to also attend a Bob Dylan concert in the 60's)\n\nWe have in the past managed to get people to see the value in paying for example around 1000 kr to go to Tivedstorp for 4 days and attend Afterglow. Or +600 kr to attend Urban Burn for 2-5 days. With zero artists on the non-existent lineup. A sense of purposeful enjoyment in the company of nice people is what I guess it all boils down to. \n\nBut I do agree 1499 is really pushing our luck. But then we have to figure out how to make up for the difference if we are to land anywhere near 500 KSEK at the end of it all. Getting an alcohol license seems unavoidable. Or selling 800 tickets at a cheaper price as Hugi is now suggesting. I really don't know whether it will be harder for us to sell 800 tickets at 5-700 kr or 350 tickets at 1499. To me it's an open question. Providing a genuine sense of community and co-creative inclusion will certainly be more of a challenge with 800 rather than 350.", "created_at": "2020-05-24 22:01:54.451056", "updated_at": "2020-05-24 22:46:50.399648", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 328, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 2.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [4949], "is_reply_to": [4949], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8920, "user_id": 43, "topic_id": 1730, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Kitchen container is out cause isolated and full with kitchen.

The round shapes and pastel colors are serenity incarnated, it is more and more precious in his life. The gradients signify breathing, inhaling certain hues, and exhaling others.\n\nAcceptance of growing older is the concept of these artworks.

And to do that now (we only have about 150 tickets sold). We will say that we postpone it \"indefinitely\", but will continue the contact with the venue. We aim for an Urban Burn in late September/early October. Or something like that.\n\nHere is a draft of a post to the community. I also suggest that we e-mail this to everyone who has bought a ticket.\n\n----\n\nDear community,\n\nAt the open meeting for Urban Burn 2020 yesterday (11/3), a decision was made to indefinitely postpone the event. This means that there will NOT be an Urban Burn 2020 in April. Representatives from the venue was with us at the meeting and has agreed to keep our communication so that we can hopefully plan an event there in the foreseeable future. Our best bet at this moment is that we will have (the best ever) Urban Burn after the summer, in September/October.\n\nThe reason for this is, as you can guess, the spreading of the covid-19. We are in no way panicking over this. The reasons to postpone in regards to the virus are several. Partly, we believe that this is the responsible way to go, so that we as a community are not part of a wider spreading of a disease that will hurt people and society. We also believe that the specific structure of Urban Burn with many people (we are counting on up towards 1000 attending), a short timeframe to plan and a very open organizational structure would make us too vulnerable in too many ways.\n\nThe membership sale on BurnerTickets is closed since yesterday. Any already bought memberships will be valid for the future event, and you will get updates as soon as we know more. Questions on potential reimbursement will be discussed, as we are still figuring out this whole situation ourselves. More information on this will come.\n\nWe would like to see this as something positive. We will probably be able to have the venue (we are still not sure if our contacts there will still have the venue next semester, but probably) and even more time. We can use this time to build and prepare something truly amazing. I am personally extremely hyped about what can come out of this. Let's spend the summer building crazy shit and come back with a bang!\n\nAnd remember to take care of each other and the community. For the new faces who has emerged who were looking forward to their first burn experience, feel free to reach out and keep in touch!\n\nAll the love,\nUrban Burn\n\n\n-----\n\nFeel free to comment!", "created_at": "2020-03-12 08:46:32.464067", "updated_at": "2020-03-12 09:19:07.003344", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 466, "wiki": false, "reads": 23, "score": 154.6, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [176, 9, 224, 185, 202], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3358, "user_id": 224, "topic_id": 767, "post_number": 7, "raw": "Great post.

This situation was very new to us, we tried to handle it as well as possible but apparently we didn't do it well enough. **This is why we decided to have a consent lead at UB.**  \n\n* The role of the consent lead involves:\n\n1. Raising awareness, for example through posters in public places and a short introduction connected to the greeting routine. Good idea to also mention consent during the opening ceremony.\n\n2. Prepare a reaction plan in case something does happen. A step by step what to do.\n\n3. The consent lead is not responsible for psychological welfare (that's what the sanctuary is for) but the consent lead could help by giving the sanctuary some information how to take care of assault victims.\n\n* As Peter said, we should not only focus on people new to the community, reminding people of consent is important to everyone.

In 2015 the time was ripe but I was a bit hesitant to take on another event after having organized both Borderland in general and creating a new theme camp there (QQQ) at the same time earlier in the summer. So in August of 2015 Afterglow didn't exist as more than as a loose idea and preliminary booking \"a weekend sometime in October\" between Frallan and myself. That's when Willemijn volunteered to take the initiative and I gratefully agreed to help out mainly onsite (with plenty of gear from the then budding Node BTW). Later the same month she involved you and G\u00f6ran and went there for a visit and the rest should be familiar to you. \n\nThe following year I created Ascension and took over and lead also the pre-event AG stuff until the handover a couple of years later. So Afterglow has been intimately connected to the Node since 2016 (and arguably from start given how much of the infrastructure that has always been transported back and forth). \n\nNoden has taken upon itself the accounting/bookkeeping work from 2016 and has also been the main platform for selling tickets through its Moonclerk account. There's a policy since several years that each Afterglow and Ascension event should strive to generate >30 KSEK in income to the Node (almost equivalent to a month's upkeep today). In return the Node has always lent out its equipment free of charge to the event.", "created_at": "2020-09-29 12:09:07.023325", "updated_at": "2020-09-29 12:09:07.023325", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 296, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 23.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [322], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6896, "user_id": 34, "topic_id": 1351, "post_number": 22, "raw": "[quote=\"MariaEuler, post:17, topic:1351\"]\n* to set up the calendar\n* the questions for the dream form\n* some basic rules.\n[/quote]\n\n1.

Yes, you read that right. We\u2019ve decided to go against the grain and aim for a big co-created bonanza at Frihamnstorget in September - hoping for the situation to allow for it. However, if it doesn\u2019t, we are planning for that too. This festival will be called \u201cAlways Becoming: The Carnival of Change\u201d and its tagline will be \u201cthe longer we wait, the better it gets\u201d. We might have to postpone until 2021, but whatever happens, this summer will be full of building and creating at Frihamnstorget to prepare for the Always Becoming festival and to create an amazing new container park full of art and excitement in Stockholm.\n \n This festival will be something between a burn and a city-festival. Its focus will be the co-creation of Frihamnstorget, and there will be music and food. It will be an all-day party that continues in House Blivande during the night. We will be celebrating change and becoming.\n \n Like a burn, a significant part of the budget will go to dreams on a Dreams platform, voted on by the participants. Like a burn, this will be co-created. Not like a burn, we will allow for food to be sold, for market stalls and for some commercial activity.\n \n And you won\u2019t have to wait until September. Every Friday from now on, we will gather the friends of Blivande and Frihamnstorget to our weekly Work Is Play events of music, barbecue, and drinks in the sun outside of Blivande.\n \n Every Friday at 18:00, we invite you to come to celebrate change with us and to dream up the vision for the Always Becoming festival. Teams are forming, and there is a lot of fun stuff to be done. Let\u2019s make this summer count!\n \n Of course, we\u2019re trying to keep track of that there won\u2019t be too many people.

Now, with some of the excitement haltered through the pausing of our physical meetings and workshops, it seems even more important to dare to dream and put some energy in making visions happen. We don\u2019t know how long the community will have to restrict physical meetings showing civic responsibility. What I do know is that I want Noden to continue to change, morph and expand, influencing the cultural landscape of Stockholm and connecting people to a sense of community.\n\nThis here right now is MY vision, I am hoping to collaborate with some of you in including and specifying the vision to manifest a shared desired reality. Please add your flavour to the vision by commenting and joining the vision dreaming. I am going to publish this in five days  on our webpage, in case you want to add something.\n\n# Noden Vision 2021\n\n### Re-Definition of Purpose \n\nNoden was created five years ago out of a facebook-group and a discussion around syntheism. Today, the organisation has morphed into something else with implicit principles and values. It is time to make the implicit explicit and reformulate the purpose of Noden in the bylaws. This is happening right now[ in the forum](https://forum.blivande.com/t/bylaws-2021/1618). The work-group on changing the bylaws additionally wants to formulate principles similar to those adopted by the Borderland, to set intentions to our interactions. These are not to be set in stone but can and will change, grow and morph with our community in time. \n\n### Reach Investing Sustainability\n\nNoden has as of today 316 members. In spring 2020, the pandemic caused a lot of members to drop off, but we have recovered during summer and early autumn 2020. Financial sustainability and independence from relying on savings that would allow for a continuous investment in equipment for workshops and improvements of communal spaces requires around 400 active monthly supporters. In 2021, we aim to reach full investing sustainability.\n\n### Governance Decentralization and Crews\n\nThis year, Noden started to shift tasks and even decision making to non-board sub-groups called \u201ccrews\u201d. The Communication-Crew is our first board-independent group and deals with communication in and around Noden. Having this crew is a big step towards decentralization. Decentralizing decision making empowers members to get more involved and prevents reliance on individual members and their involvement or reliance on the board for decision making, which makes the organisation more resilient and vivid. We hope to expand involvement by encouraging the creation of more crews working on other tasks (eg. PR-Crew, Outreach-Crew and Members-Onboarding-Crew). Members can join the crew that either helps them develop a skill or a crew they want to gift their talent/skill to.\n\n### The New Generation - Noden Kids\n\nNoden is already a place welcoming a broad group of people of all ages. In the past, we have had a couple of children's events during the weekends. Having kids or kids friendly events allows for both parents and children to enjoy activities and community together. We have a growing number of new parents in our midst, so let\u2019s create the settings to include the whole family.\n\n### Welcoming New Members\n\nThe Communication-Crew is planning to set up a better way of welcoming new members. It can be difficult to understand Noden and the wider community as a newbie, thus it can take months for members to understand the level of initiative and involvement possible. We hope to overcome involvement barriers by organising reoccurring member-welcoming events and dinners. \n\n### Getting Smarter Together\n\nNoden has historically had mostly workshops centered around movement, music and personal development. And Noden can be more. We have a beautiful location in central Stockholm and could invite speakers, scientists and researchers to present their work to a public audience. Noden can be a trial stage for young researchers and professionals to talk about their work to a non-expert crowd. At the same time, the audience can learn about what people think and work on in different professions across society and get connected and inspired. These events could resemble the current safe stage and be enriched with academic and professional content. The world of today is interdisciplinary.\n\n### Authentic Relating Hub\n\nAuthentic Relating refers to a communication technique that uses games and exercises to support empathy and curiosity in conversations enabling rapid and deep human connection. Noden has always been a place of relational experimentation through the spirit of co-creation and a general tendency of its members to explore conventional relational boundaries. In september 2020, we started Authentic Relating meet-ups at Noden, that have since become one of our most visited workshops. Authentic Relating relies on principles facilitating conversations between anyone, not focused on an outcome or compromise, but focused on understanding the others perspective. In today\u2019s polarized world, this skill is necessary to build bridges and understand the complexity of human opinions and views. Noden has the potential to become an Authentic Relating Hub in Stockholm and contribute to empathic and productive conversation.\n\n![photo_2020-10-31_20-27-18|355x500, 100%](upload://dBWMTsfleLrWrNZlOJnW46Y4pGl.jpeg)", "created_at": "2020-11-04 00:27:07.472814", "updated_at": "2020-11-04 00:34:00.739095", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 878, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 177.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [210, 330], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7860, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1580, "post_number": 1, "raw": "We are [producing a \"digital tour\"](https://forum.blivande.com/t/best-videographer-we-know/1564?u=hugi) of Blivande.

We will use this post to write the script and coordinate people and scenes. \n\n## Production team\n\n* **Coordination, script, storytelling, narration:** @hugi\n* **Interview subjects:** @hampus, but we also need more - both members and team!\n* **Main videography and editing:** Rodrigo Rioseco (will ask him to come to the forum)\n* **Additional video material:** @Misscirkus, maybe @Sinikka and [everyone contributing videos](https://forum.blivande.com/t/urgent-we-need-videos/1572) from their archives \n\n## Archive footage\nWe have some material [in this Dropbox folder](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/40whp7d70rgotmi/AADV2IpLs-dPC7hFivpo3gf8a?dl=0).\n\n@ben.english, would you happen to have any video materials from the photoshoot? \n\n## Context and information\n\n> On behalf of the (German) Ministry of Economics, we support the cultural and creative sector by making it visible and by bringing together economic actors from the creative industries and other sectors, institutions and politics. On  **5 November 2020** , we are organizing a major conference on the topic of  **social and sustainable economy**  (\"[Kongress Wirtschaft & Werte](https://kreativ-bund.de/veranstaltungen/wirtschaft-und-werte)\"). In this context, we would like to shed light on projects and companies from our industry and from other sectors that are already active in this field. In one of the sessions of the conference, we would like to show  **three innovative projects**  **from other European countries** .\n\n> The concept behind Blivande would fit perfectly in our track \u201ccreative & social impact\u201d, one of the main themes of our event, which is why we would be happy to show the project to our participants!\n\n> We would like to take a look at your space and hear about the project through a short \"guided tour\" (in English) in the form of  **a video shot in advance (duration: 8 to 10 minutes)**.\n\n> As we will show this video as a part of our digital European tour, it would be great if you could start with a few words about where you are located and how Blivande fits the topic of the track \u201ccreative & social impact\u201d. You are also welcome to present how you are organized and how the project started. And of course, we hope to get a short tour of your space! The video should last between 8 and 10 minutes in the format 16:9. In general, we avoid using filters or too many effects. We will add a little intro video at the beginning of the session to announce the tour.\n\n## Scenes \n\n### A conversation between Hampus and Hugi \n**Time to record:** Sunday, October 25th\n**People involved:** Rodrigo, @hampus, @hugi  \n\n**Themes:**\n* Idea behind Blivande \n* Vision for the future \n* Why are we doing this?\n\n### Additional narration\n**Time to record:** Sunday, October 25th\n**People involved:** Rodrigo,  @hugi  \n\n* This will be a recording of a pre-written script that will be read by me, used to cut between scenes.\n\n### PPE production story\n**Time to record:** Sunday, October 25th\n**People involved:** Rodrigo, @hampus, @hugi  \n\nTheme: Participatory culture for resilience\nAdditional footage from PPE production videos will be provided (@Ollxor, @hampus, who has the high res stuff?)\n \n### Community \n* Interview with someone from Noden (maybe something for the communications crew @filipnystrom?)\n* Personal story about Blivande and impact on one's life in Stockholm (@MariaEuler, would you be interested?)\n* Clips from @Misscirkus from people working in the house \n\n### Participatory culture \n* @Ollxor, could I interview you about this? \n* Talk about roots in the Borderland \n* Blurring the boundaries between artist and audience, as well as between professions and disciplines\n* Growing a creative cluster\n* @NinaLindberg, would you be up for an interview up your container? \n\n### An ecosystem of initiatives\nI'm not sure who is available, so making some suggestions here for scenes. Let's see how many of them we can fit in. Depending on availability, we can split filming between Rodrigo, @Misscirkus, and @Sinikka if she is available.  \n\n#### Interview with Secret Experience \n@NinaLindberg and @bobspeakman, if you are up for it, when is a good day? Could we have an interview with you up in your container? Especially about how it feels to run a project at Frihamnstorget, how is it different, what makes it special?\n\n#### Interview with Frida & Simon\n@Frida_Simon and @Simon - would you be up for that? If so, when would be a good day?  \n\n#### Interview with Tobi \n@elch, @Manu, @missChief - I think it could be cool to have a scene with you guys working and talking in the workshop. But when are you back?   \n\n#### Interview with Theo\n@Thedodod, are you available?

In fact, _most_ of what an association is will not be in its bylaws. Here are, for example, the [statutes of Fylkingen](https://fylkingen.se/stadgar). \n\n> **Namn och \u00e4ndam\u00e5l** \n> \u00a7 1. F\u00f6reningens namn \u00e4r FYLKINGEN. \n> \u00a7 2.

They should be no gold standard.\n\nFor example, [THS](https://ths.kth.se/en/general/policy-documents-and-meeting-protocols) has statutes (which is how they translate \"stadgar\"), bylaws (which is how they translate reglemente), vision and even a document of \"opinions\" that the organization holds (\u00e5siktsdokument). It also has a whole bunch of policies and PMs, all accepted by a general assembly at some point and valid until annulled or changed by another general assembly. \n\n*(Actually, I am reminded by the THS translations that f\u00f6reningssvenska is super confusing when translated...)*\n\nWhy separate it into different documents? Because something like this, in the *\"stadgar\"*, should be very hard to change (by the general assembly through a simple majority vote, that must be repeated and passed twice in two consecutive years):\n\n> A decision regarding the dissolution of THS shall require a vote of a qualified majority of the Student Union Council at two meetings of the Student Union Council in two consecutive year of operations.\n\nThus, good \"stadgar\" are usually dry and boring documents with little meat in them.\n\nWhile something like this, in the *reglemente*, should be easier to change (by the general assembly through a simple majority vote):\n\n> The THS core values shall permeate and guide all the activities of THS and shall comprise the following:\n> \u2022 Fellowship and pride.\n> \u2022 Progress through ambition.\n> \u2022 Joy in participation.\n\nParagraphs like that fit better into another sort of document, that is more dynamic and not as dry and formal.\n\nFurthermore, while the language of \"stadgar\" and \"reglemente\" should be relatively unambiguous and hard to misinterpret, the language of an \"\u00e5siktsdokument\" or \"vision\" often needs to be open to interpretation. \n\n> THS believes that:\n> \u2022 the level of student aid should be raised in proportion to the increase in costs in the rest of\n> society;\n\nThis is why I am opposed to the principles being written into our \"stadgar\". However, the decision is one that the AGM could make. If we don't agree on this point, we can just solve this issue at the AGM by presenting a few different motions and voting on them one by one - where including the 10 principles would be one of those motions.", "created_at": "2020-12-01 17:56:12.628134", "updated_at": "2020-12-01 21:56:51.204417", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 520, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 61.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [8780], "is_reply_to": [8780], "is_liked_by": [8, 210, 294], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8926, "user_id": 34, "topic_id": 1268, "post_number": 46, "raw": "super nice!

Edgeryders is one such connection, but it's not the only one. In our ongoing exploration of that, I want to share two concepts that have been in the Blivande DNA from the beginning.\n\nEven back in early 2018 when it was just me and Hampus testing ideas out, a very early organization that we were inspired by was Enspiral. I'm not sure I have properly introduced Enspiral or how I overlap with that network to @Sero, @SofiaAnner, and @Linnea, so I thought I would post this nice video:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ZDzLSRAo5ME   \n\nA concept that is very entwined with Enspiral through my friend Richard Bartlett is the concept of [microsolidarity](https://www.microsolidarity.cc/). It has been a big inspiration in coming up with the strategy for Blivande, and is something that Hampus and I kept in mind from when Richard first launched the concept in late 2018. Richard is also a key member of Enspiral.\n\nThese networks overlap with ours through many connections:\n* Richard and I have become good friends. He and his partner Nati were also participants of the Borderland Dreams hackathon in 2019.\n* Brooks (who I don't think @SofiaAnner has met yet?) and I are both in a community called \"the weavers guild\", along with many members of Enspiral and mutual friends of me and Hampus like Ronan Harrington. \n* Another member of Enspiral is Stephen Reid, who Hampus and I know, and who Hampus has worked with in [the Psychedelic Society](https://www.psychedelicsociety.org.uk/).\n* Loomio, which the Node and the Borderland both use, is a product of Enspiral and co-founded by Richard Bartlett.\n* Dominic Tarr who was in the Working Class Heroes at the Borderland with us, is the founder of something called Scuttlebutt \u2013 another New Zealand centered network that overlaps a lot with Enspiral. I have also been very tangentially involved with Scuttlebutt.\n\nNow I'm curious for you to think about what your networks are, and how they overlap with ours. What can we learn?

This is because: \n* Region Stockholm had an earlier deadline and some things and assumptions changed in the meantime\n* In the application to Region Stockholm we assumed we would apply for more funding from Konstr\u00e5det\n* These applications structure their questions differently, and budget categories are not one to one\n* When we realized that we wanted to run the Always Becoming program, that affected the total budget plan\n\nI'm making all of this clear since I actually included a link to this thread in the application as an example of our transparent and participatory way of working :sweat_smile:\n\nAnyway, thanks all!

Therefore is recommended to write a 1-3 page document of \"Best Practice Guidelines\" like these. \nHowever, whatever you articulate are no ultimately and always true rules. Contexts, teams, needs and tools keep changing. Tread this document as a basis for communication and something that needs regular discussion and updating. *(Recommendation: Schedule a call just to discuss this issue for your group)*\n\n### 2. **Explore the level of structure that works for your group of self-managers**\nIn remote work, everyone has to be their own manager to a higher degree. This challenge makes you grow but also takes energy. If you are working in a very flat or implicit organisation it can be hard to identify who is responsible for which tasks in helping meetings or projects go smoothly. Explore rotating, voting or assigning implicit roles like \"moderator\", \"note keeper\" or \"agenda writer\". These jobs do not necessarily be done by one person alone, but giving someone explicit lead in something enables them to act more objective, to value their contribution and to start and finish tasks. *Reports from positive remote work experiences usually include a degree of concrete structure.*\n\n### 3. **Regular check-ins**\n* The **appropriate form** of check-in depends on the size of your group.\n     * In **small groups** ( <5 ) check-ins can be incorporated into your topical calls as a quick round at the beginning.\n     * In **big groups** ( >5, <15 ) check-ins should be scheduled as their own regular sessions. A weekly or biweekly schedule is recommended.\n     * In **large groups** ( > 15 ) it is recommended to use a chat tool instead of in-person check-ins (which could and should happen in smaller subgroups). A regular schedule can still be applied by agreeing to write a t3 -5 sentence check at the beginning of each week for example.\n* **A check-in is not a report.** The goal is not to give a scope over everything you are doing. Aim for a speaking time around 3 minutes and either:\n     * Flag a concrete problem or overload and ask for help\n     * Celebrate something positive\n     * Give necessary information about private or professional context that currently strongly influence your work or mood and that you feel comfortable sharing quick and publically\n* It can be helpful to formulate \"check-in questions\" like:\n>    * How is your workload this week?\n>    * What are your challenges/hardships/important events this week?\n>    * What are you looking forward to this week?\n\n### 4. **Calls**\nIn general, the appropriate behaviour in calls is also influenced by the size and character of your group. For this university course of yours, however we can also formulate a few general guidelines:\n* **Camera on** \nAlways keep your camera on during the call. As a student, you are required to be an active listener even in a big audience. Facial expressions are important and you are encouraged to exaggerate your reactions and body language.\n* **Mute**\nWhen you are not speaking, mute yourself\n* **Prepare an agenda**\nAn agenda helps to manage expectations and keep track of what needs and get done. Agendas can be drafted collaboratively in a shared document with or without an assigned owner (see above at the structure point). \n* **Use the chat** \nThe chat is a powerful tool that can make online lectures and meetings even more interactive than \"in-person\" meetings. Use it to ask questions and comment without interrupting the current speaker verbally, to share links and to ask for and assign speaking time.\n* **Use hand signs and other agreed symbols** (there is a limit to the group size in which such signs are effective. If your group is larger than 15 people or so, use the chat to ask for speaking time)\nSuggestion:\n      * Thums up: \"Yes\"\n      * Thumbs down: \"No\"\n      * Rise a finger: \"I would like to speak\"\n      * Rise open hand with all fingers: \"I **absolutely** want to speak as soon as possible\"\n      * Many programs like zoom also enable you to use emojis. These can also be very useful.\n* **Moderation**\nEspecially in bigger or large groups, it is recommended to have a dedicated moderator who keeps track of the agenda and chat, shares links and helps to distribute speaking time. ASsigning this as an official role enables the moderator to take an objective role.\n\n### 5. **Platforms**\n* **Keep your default tool set small, an experiment and develop in smaller groups**\nThis point especially is not written in stone! There are always new updates and tools emerging. However, especially in a large group, it can be useful to agree on a limited number of unfolding tools as not to keep adding to the number of applications one needs to keep track of. In smaller groups, like your project groups however you are encouraged to explore a more diverse toolset to figure out what works for you and your project. These experiences can also inform regular discussions about the changing and updating of your unfold toolset.\n* **When choosing your default tools try to cover these 3 categories. (Examples are just suggestions)**. *(The concrete tool examples are currently given in this list are informed by the quantitative and qualitative reports of both courses as of September 2020 in context of the \"remote Collaboration\" workshop. These are just suggestions on that basis with the goal of keeping the default toolset low. They can be argued with and certainly should be regularly questioned and updated.)*\n     * Fast: for direct communication (chats and calls)\n        * *Messenger*\n        * *Zoom*\n     * Slow: for shared work and development\n        * *Google docs (here it might be worth looking in the possibility to set up a shared drive for all students with larger storage capacity)*\n     * Formal: When communicating contracts or important client conversations\n        * *Email*\n\n* **Other suggestions:**\n   * **This Forum:** We have set up this [open coursework group](https://forum.blivande.com/c/plato/plato-coursework-open/34) and this [closed coursework group](https://forum.blivande.com/c/plato/plato-coursework-restricted/33) for you here on discourse. We offer you to use it together with the dreams tools presented in the Plato workshop. **This is an offer.** The open group makes it easy to share your work and questions with a larger community and the public, the closed group lets you work safely on client work and other things you do not yet want to share outside the course. This type of platform emphasis the process and lets you follow and learn from it.\n   * Discuss if you want to use **project management tools** at some point. Those can also add unnecessary work depending on your organisation needs.\n\n### 6. **Socialising**\nOne time or regular social events can improve your experience, connection and therefore collaboration as a group. Explore organising such events. You already reported a few great ideas during the workshop. Here are a few that came up the most:\n* Quiz\n  * Music\n  * Personal/icebreaker\n    * On zoom\n    * Via chat\n* Home office tour\n* Show each other your favourite personal item in a call - obscurest wins\n* Play games together\n\nAdding to, developing and realising some of these ideas would be great. Maybe start with scheduling a call to discuss what you would like to try first and what you would need for it. Of course, organising this takes time and energy, but if it improves your connections to each other and eases your collaboration it will be worth it.\n\n## Thank you very much for your time and contributions during the workshop. \n\n# \n\n**You do not have to commit to following these guidelines to the letter, but you are asked to acknowledge their existence and commit to actively question, develop and communicate your remote collaboration processes.**\n\n**One way to do so would be to comment here to show you read them, to voice support or critique to get this ongoing process going.**\n\n### Finally: This post is a \"wiki\" this means that each and everyone of you is able to edit it via the little pen icon underneath to keep updating it.", "created_at": "2020-10-01 08:56:05.561858", "updated_at": "2020-10-01 09:15:08.540513", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1360, "wiki": true, "reads": 17, "score": 68.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8440, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1344, "post_number": 45, "raw": "When it was started before the summer, the vision was that while Noden largely serves its own community, the purpose of Frihamnens Kulturf\u00f6rening should be to serve the local community close to Frihamnen.

This category is open for anyone to read, but only monthly donors can participate in the discussions. This is the primary part of the forum for any discussions. One pinned discussion thread at the top will be open for anyone to participate in, so that curious non-members can ask questions.\n* One *subcategory* called **\"Noden: The Board\"**. This subcategory is closed to anyone (both to read and to write) but the Board, and will be used for sensitive information etc.\n* One *subcategory* called **\"Noden: Communication crew\"**. This subcategory is open to read for everyone, but closed for participation to the communication crew.\n\nThis means that all important discussions is held in the big category, and more specific, sensitive discussions is held in the board subcategory or in the comteam subcategory. Anyone can see the general (non-sensitive) discussions and what's going on in the community, and if you have questions, there's an open thread for non-members pinned at the top.\n\nPlease comment if you feel this strategy to be too complicated or if you think that there are better ways to organize it etc.", "created_at": "2020-09-30 14:17:31.388144", "updated_at": "2020-09-30 14:20:22.332539", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 254, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 67.8, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [109, 322, 11], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8277, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1576, "post_number": 33, "raw": "Oooh, I like the messy EL-wire installation!", "created_at": "2020-11-04 20:33:35.461951", "updated_at": "2020-11-04 20:33:35.461951", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 8, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 8.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [8276], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8046, "user_id": 294, "topic_id": 1616, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hi, I was asked by the Kidtopia people if it is they can arrange Kidtopia on a weekend in February 2021.

Although, the difference here being that it was spread out over a whole city.\n\nReason I mention this is that since we are located in a building, it could be tricky to utilize this part of the platform. A workaround could be to include the location from placement code system in your place so people can locate it.  So the \"place\" \"Magic unicorn pond BAR\" would include the location code A2, which could then be checked against the placement code map.\n\nWhat would be even cooler though, is to map out the entire building we're in in \"Open street map\", as we have an image of the floor plan. This would in turn then be visible in the interactive map portion on the Hoffnung platform, making it easier to find things.\n\nAll of this could potentially be unnecessary since the venue isn't that big and it's nice to sometimes just get lost in the stream and see where you end up!\n\nHowever, the idea behind the platform is still really cool and I almost want to implement it just for fun and proof of concept.

I see Noden as a place to evolve and disseminate burner culture, and ideas like gifting, de-commodification and participation are particularly important to me. \n\nThere are constant discussions in and around the board that question these. There are workshop leaders who want to charge money (\"donations\") for workshops. There is a drive to have commercial events with cover charges, where members are consumers and a small group of leaders are event creators, and so forth. \n\nThat is the reason why I want the principles to be the constitution for Noden. I don't want Noden to devolve into an irrelevant and boring place for semi-commercial yoga workshops or just being a cheap place to dance.

I'm Hugi, one of the founders of Blivande. Thanks, @darkturo for the introduction.\n\n[quote=\"Olga, post:1, topic:1652\"]\n* An open space where we could spend around 3 hours for distributing the \u2018rescued food\u2019 once per week, preferably Saturday mornings (flexible schedule). We do not need a kitchen in this space, just a couple of tables and a plug to potentially use a fridge (that we already have).\n* Access to Frihamnstorget kitchen to organize folkk\u00f6k events once/twice per month (great flexibility for dates/times).\n[/quote]\n\nWhat a fantastic initiative. I completely support this! I am truly excited about this happening in the house. This is exactly the sort of initiative we should serve. Let's talk about how to make this work in practice! \n\nMy initial thoughts, based on your information:\n\nBlivande is a participatory community. Our members take initiative to create what happens in the house and also take responsibility for those who participate in the events they organize. Ideally, a member of Blivande should take it upon themselves to be present and responsible for this activity before, during, and after it takes place. This includes greeting people, making sure they understand where they are, making sure that doors to private areas are closed and locked, and that Blivande is left clean and tidy after it's done. All of our members hold keys to the house, and have access 24/7.\n\nAs for timing, Saturday mornings are not a very busy time at Blivande, so it's good. The only problem could be that if there has been a party or event the day before, which is usually the case in normal times, the cleaning might still be ongoing. This is probably not a showstopper, but I will leave it up to @hampus to make the call as he is in charge of the event side of things. Blivande is also a very dynamic and active place, and things are quite fluid, so the person responsible would have to keep themselves in the loop with the community.\n\nFoodsharing Stockholm is very close to the core purpose of Blivande. When an opportunity like that presents itself, we like to give it an extra push. For example, we have given people \"community\" memberships in the past for doing work that contributes to the commons. Foodsharing Stockholm contributes to the commons of Blivande and Stockholm as a whole, so **I propose that Blivande sponsor someone on the Foodsharing Stockholm team with a free membership** to our workshops (called a [Studio Tau membership](https://forum.blivande.com/t/2-create/902)). They would become a full member, with access to all of our workshops and tools, and have their own key to the house with 24/7 access. In return, they are responsible for the collaboration with Foodsharing Stockholm and for making that collaboration work with the rest of our members.\n\nFrom our end, this means that we establish a relationship with someone on the team. For us, personal relationships are everything and would help us commit fully to this collaboration. An ideal person would be someone who:\n* Is conscientious and orderly\n* Otherwise a good fit for Studio Tau and the rest of the members \n\nIt would be even better if that person would also:\n* Benefit from the free art studio and workshop membership\n* Live relatively close (although that's mostly for convenience for that person)\n\nThis way, we could really make Foodsharing Stockholm a part of the community and make resources available for each other. What do you think of this model @Olga?\n\nWe would need to discuss this with the whole Blivande team and check in with the members, but my feeling about it is positive.\n\n[quote=\"Olga, post:1, topic:1652\"]\nOur current partners\n[/quote]\n\nWe have previously gotten donations from ICA V\u00e4rtan, it's worth it to check with them as they are very close by.", "created_at": "2020-11-09 20:40:51.414308", "updated_at": "2020-11-09 21:10:15.262467", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 652, "wiki": false, "reads": 29, "score": 210.8, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [8324], "is_reply_to": [8324], "is_liked_by": [403, 176, 285], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7675, "user_id": 13, "topic_id": 1497, "post_number": 10, "raw": "**Var bor du?

Hipp & Happ. Oh, thought it was Frihamnstorget. The identity of Frihamnstorget currently is closer to a dead fish in a lil' bowl, with Stockholm youth moving in and out with their paddle rackets. It's like the place in an old western film, when they arrive to an abandoned town and the tumbleweeds flow by.<br /><br /> **Vilken slags n\u00e4ring vill du ska etablera sig i Frihamnen t.ex. livsmedel, detaljhandel, restauranger osv?

Describe your vision for Frihamnen in 2040?** <br /> Would like it to be a hub for creativity, a lab for action, a space for dreaming - rather than solely a source of entertainment, storage, food and drinks.

I added you to the Noden open community group after our chat the other day and as Diana also points to here that is indeed a good place for you to find more people and volunteers. \n\nAs mentioned the kitchen container we have there could be made available to host regular Folkk\u00f6k-events that would be easy to make synergize with other types of activities and culture. Come for the food, stay for the X-kind of thing. \n\nFurther down the line if everything pans out well and takes root in Frihamnen the growing project could potentially get its own container. Food refrigeration is a very common usage of specialized containers and such a container could also act as a large fridge for other events and ventures existing in the future square. \n\nAnother thing that I would like to mention here and that you and others in your group might be interested in is that there are aligned ideas floating around all over Sweden for starting food co-ops inspired by organizations such as [Park Slope Coop](https://www.foodcoop.com/). \n\nA trailer for a documentary about it here: https://vimeo.com/ondemand/foodcoopthefilm\n\nWe have community members like Pietro and Nadine who's been trying to start up such an organization in Stockholm for a while now and while that's a really big project to pull off initiatives such as yours could act as auxiliary stepping stones on the way. \n\nOf course urban farming initiatives as mentioned by Tobi above are also potential allies in a networked coalition for food sustainability in the city. There's people at Utopia Arkitekter that I plan to contact about that as they are currently looking into ways of enabling more small-scale food production within the city. Would love to see Frihamnen in general, with Frihamnstorget in particular as its connecting hub, be a node for this kind of initiatives in Stockholm. \n\nYou mention Sopk\u00f6ket and I've bumped into Filip since around the time he started it. They're doing good work!

I was glad to see you post about this as personal initiative is the only thing that will push Studio Tau along towards being fully operational, living up to its potential and promise. \n\nWe have several people experienced with laser cutters but the current limitation is the lack of a room with proper ventilation. We can however - now that it's summer - get away with temporarily working with an open window allowing for an exhaust tube to be pulled out. I've been informed today by @hugi that @annielocke and David Giertta are working on getting the laser cutter up and running as its needed for the BL Temple build. Best would be to join forces with them so as to speed up that process. \n\nI'm personally strongly in favor of having both our laser cutter and a CNC that I'm also working on getting here placed inside a container. This would side-step the whole permit question around ventilation holes in the facade as well as free up much needed space in Tau for other things . It would also of course make the operations more mobile as we could for example move a CNC to BL and other events of interest and relevance. Perhaps in collaboration with the STEAMobile of Folk Lab and so on and so forth. \n\nOn this note I will contact Containertj\u00e4nst tomorrow and see if we can quickly invest in a 20\" container for this purpose. It would be placed 100 m2 from the Tau entrance where there is already an existing 62A power outlet. In a month or two we might end up having it placed even closer to us on the Containerville parking lot (Frihamnstorget) that we're about to build in collaboration with Stockholms Hamnar. Just across the street from House Blivande. \n\nDavid Giertta has serviced the laser before and has agreed to do this for us here in the future (if we pay him). I  fully agree that the laser cutter is vital to Tau and personally think that its service and maintenance should be professionalized based on the experiences from Stugan. We should also implement some kind of course in how to use it, held regularly so all interested members can be educated in its basic operation and maintenance. To be clear I'm stating this *opinion* as a fellow member of Tau and not a Blivande representative. If you after your meeting conclude that you do want to take this on yourselves (the continuous service and maintenance) then I of course will not object to that but rather applaud it.", "created_at": "2019-06-10 17:56:28.716604", "updated_at": "2019-06-10 17:56:28.716604", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 439, "wiki": false, "reads": 20, "score": 14.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7523, "user_id": 377, "topic_id": 1497, "post_number": 8, "raw": "**Var bor du?

Sleep 8\nhours, work 8 hours, try to fit in everything else \u2013 like washing,\nresting, loving and caring 8 hours. Finding time for learning and\nexploring is not easy.\n\n**Employment is normally focused on getting shit done** from a productivity point of view. Its not uncommon that education withing a corporate context get little room in the every day practice. Also education in a profession, is often directly connected to the actual business or to the line of work that you are hired to perform.\n\n> Finding time to learn is almost in a conflict with the process of making a living.\n\n**The exception is of course** people working directly within academia, where the learning process itself is what makes the living. But persons within academia has its own problems, not seldom tided to economy. How do you raise money to learn, research and study your passion subject if nobody is\nprepared to pay for it?\n\n**What if there is a way** to establish a learning sphere in the middle between academia and\nbusiness - tying that in to the Blivande Community, mixing in the principles from Burning Man, Syntheistic philosophy and Participatory culture that already flourish there?

Today I work as an innovation designer crossing over UX, UI, graphic design, and product design. I reached out to Blivande as I have recently moved to Stockholm from London and have been looking to be part of a creative hub in Stockholm. I am a natural maker and I love starting crazy projects, big or small.\n\nAfter speaking with Maria I understood that there's a need for an organiser to make the Blivande Akademi a reality. I love this initiative and am gladly taking over this role! I will try my best to cater to all facilitators' wishes and needs in regard to this project, and to make this wonderful idea become reality. \n\nAs a starting point, what I see that we need is:\n- An overarching theme or mission of the initiative to help clarify for the potential participants what we are doing, what Blivande is, and what they can expect.\n\n- Making it easy for the potential participants to sign up and get information. This might mean a website with info, contact info and a sign-up system. \n\nI have a suggestion on first point which is the theme of the initiative which I want to share in our meeting together (see Maria's post above) If anyone has an idea about the second point, or if the dreams platform can be used for this, it would be great! I am still getting a hang of the resources available so I might need some explaining or informing of the different platforms that already exist. \n\n\"The sum of the cardamum\" is that I would like to still try and get at least three workshops happen next week, they might be small and hard to find participants to this late, but we can see it as a trial for us organisers and facilitators as well. So if we can have a meeting tomorrow Friday in order to get the theme, sign-up system, and workshops pinned down I think we have what we need to make this happen. If you as a facilitator needs anything at all as in throwing around ideas, answering questions about the workshops then please do not hesitate and contact me!\n\nHave a great day and remember to vote!

I went to Burning Man for the first time in 2015 and I had started the journey towards creating something like the Node already in 2012. That process was turbocharged by the passing of my father in 2014. We had a contract and keys for the old Node from May in 2015, almost 4 months before I went to Burning Man.\n\nBurning Man is certainly *one* source of indirect inspiration through the vector of Borderland. \n\nThis said I do fully concur in that I think it's important to safeguard that the Node continues to represent something a bit more profound than being a mere workshop venue. I don't agree however that wedding it more officially to Burning Man will accomplish that. Burning Man (org) is a corporate dinosaur, relatively speaking, and is facing huge issues.

Moving it to to gallery is however not a well-thought through suggestion for several reasons. \nPrimarily being that the Gallery is now very nicely decorated as part of Secret Experience (something that I haven't seen discussed here on the forum by the way @bobspeakman & @NinaLindberg). \n\nI discussed this yesterday with @cecilia_ulfsdotter and explained then that there is currently no free space to place this table outside from the Open Space room itself. \n\nAs soon as we get the ceramics container it could come to good use in there I believe. This should happen in the coming 3 month period if finances will allow (we are waiting for news as to whether we get the grant we applied for to build such a container). \nWhat's the ETA on that decision @hugi?\n\nI don't quite see the urgency in this however. The room is not over-occupied as it is now with its current configuration (and that was before the whole storage wall was removed). \n\nWhat's more pressing now in my opinion is that @Simon collects his large painting standing on top of the table which given its fragile nature prohibits work in its vicinity. It has been there for several weeks and placing it there was meant to last only for a couple of days as quick fix to an immediate problem. \n\nWe also need to have a discussion on the placement of @cecilia_ulfsdotter's 4th painting (the one standing in the middle of the room).

We (@jonasjohansson @elch and I) have been working on these LED install (primarily the holders) since the middle of August. We have discussed this across many different forms of media (forum, chat, in person) and I even presented this at the **townhall meeting in mid October** (with no feeback/suggestions of location change etc.). Every single one of these discussions resulted in how these tubes were designed specifically for the gallery container. **An extra effort was made** make them look super naijs **because these were supposed to eye-level and permanently part of the gallery.**\n\nThis includes:\n\n* custom STL design of these holders rather than simple rubber endcaps \n* investing in brass 3D print filament which is quite $$\n* a huge amount of time spent printing (since Oct), troubleshooting the printers, and removing the support \n* designing and building a tumbler so that these could be polished for full \"effect\" \n\nI have been responsive in putting in extra effort to get these finalized ASAP given the square's lighting push [here](https://forum.blivande.com/t/lighting-at-frihamnstorget/1576/4). In response to @NinaLindberg's call (fbook chat) for more lights in time for the secret experience yesterday, @elch actually tried to install the tubes on Monday but postponed due to the mess/noise it would make. This forum post was started was to discuss adjusting the gallery sign, not to discuss the location of the tubes. \n\nI am fully sympathetic to wanting to maintain the \"look\" of the gallery container. (The critique of LED tubes aesthetic not matching does seem a bit hypocritical given that the GALLERY sign also uses rainbow WS2811s but that's not particularly important.) I don't personally care where the tubes go - this isn't an ego-thing or something. I was told that the orange container bridge over the yellow made a dark spot of the square that sorely needed light. I suggested installing Jonas' old project, that was encouraged, and the three of us made it happen. Simple.\n\nMy frustration is that this location concern has never been previously mentioned - In the many discussions we've had about this over four months, if i had ever gotten a hint that there were considerations installing higher up (orange/red containers) or less prominently, I would have happily slapped some rubber endcaps on the tubes and been done with it. The extra effort on my behalf was specifically made in response to direct feedback that we should take this opportunity to give the gallery container this extra love and attention. \n\nThis is a sore spot as I am experiencing a similar pattern with the [dome column design](https://forum.blivande.com/t/dome-temple-sketch/1327/22). A project is started -> others are consulted and a concept is discussed -> design is finalized and \"signed off\" -> a radically inclusive forum discussion starts which ultimately negates all the work done to that point. I value my time, and have no interest in spending where it is not of use.

It\u2019s only a year ago that we opened the door to our house in the harbor. It feels crazy how far we have come in just a year. Our 2019 was about filling the house with atmosphere and getting it ready for the many years ahead of us. Our 2020 will be about growing our community, and we want to get off to a flying start!\n\nSo, we\u2019re giving ourselves a birthday present, and we are hoping for that birthday present to be  *you* . We have decided to open up the house during all of February to prospective members. If you\u2019ve been thinking about becoming a member, this is the time. If you sign up as a member now, you would only pay 1000 SEK in deposit for February to get the key, and then roll over to a regular membership on March 1st. If you decide to not stick with working at Blivande, you get the deposit back when you return the key.\n\n![IMG_1067.jpg](https://forum.blivande.com/uploads/blivande/original/1X/d44fd1281a07faf27dd65d35f2c21807bc03941b.jpeg)\n\nThis is not an \u201copen house\u201d, but an offer to come have a conversation with us about becoming a member. We are creating a community, so we will figure out together if it is a good fit, which it usually is. Your intention should be to continue after February as a regular paying member, either on a flexible desk plan or with your own fixed desk.\n\n## So, you\u2019re ready to apply? Great!\n\n1. Send us a short introduction, and we will decide a time for a quick chat in the house.\n2. If we deem our visions and values aligned you are welcomed in for a trial month on a flexible desk plan.\n3. You sign up and pay 1000 SEK in deposit. This is for the key, and for us to feel that we are making a mutual investment in each other. If you decide at the end of February that co-working at Blivande is not right for you, that amount will be reimbursed. If you continue, we will will deduct 1000 SEK from your first regular payment.\n4. On March 1st, your membership automatically rolls over to a regular paid flexible membership, paid three months at a time.\n\n![IMG_1080.jpg](https://forum.blivande.com/uploads/blivande/original/1X/32ee4b2b9348543c5027e76ac55e66d22d83bcb1.jpeg)\n\n## Questions?\n\n### I\u2019m already a member, will I also get February for free?\n\nWe\u2019re doing this to grow our community and bring more fantastic people to the house. Existing members don\u2019t get a month off, but this is a perfect time to reach out to that person who you\u2019ve always wanted to have at Blivande.\n\n### What if I change my mind?\n\nIf you feel at the end of February that Blivande isn\u2019t for you, you simply let us know and we end the trial membership and reimburse your 1000 SEK deposit when you return the key.\n\n### Is access to the workshops of Studio Tau included in the trial?\n\nYes, absolutely! You get full access to the workshops like all members of the co-working space. In fact, we would very much welcome members who will use that opportunity.\n\n### I want to become a Tau member, is this for me?\n\nThis offer is especially aimed at Studio Beta. Prospective members should be looking to become members of the co-working space.

Weather was sunny for a bit and increasingly cold. The Whiteboard was brought up to the balcony via the forklift, a very much appreciated gesture.*\n\n## Let\u2019s get in the greens: Urban Gardening at Frihamnstorget:\n\n*What we discussed regarding the gardening:*\n\n1. **Installing a watering system like in Tobi\u2019s balcony**. Water pipes with holes and an attached timer make it easy to care for the crops. People could plant and them not worry much more about the plants:\n![image|480x305](upload://du6Vcercw0DYdXYl19MaQ4rDyFs.jpeg) \n* Budget for water system:\n* Less than 3000 to 4000 SEK in total Material costs\n* @Thedodod  and @elch will start to set this up now either way. Thank you for the urban garden pipe heros!\n\n2. **What type of planters?**\n*Options:*\n* Cut open metal tubes\n* Like the existing wood boxes\n* Green wall structures to be made during welding course\n* Collaboration with[ \u201cHydrogarden\u201d](https://www.hydrogarden.se/) contact through @Joannis-Magnus \n*Can we/ want we collaborate with Hydrogarden setting up a shop at Frihamn to get to have a planting experiment station/demonstration station there? Hydrogarden would need to find a shop space near Frihamnstorget. Could we help them get that?*\n\n3. **Compost:** Toby will build it and we could all add to it at Frihamnen\n\n4. **Bees** : (Tobee ;)):honeybee:\n* @elch wants to get bees either way. We do not yet attach a budget. Will be explored later after more research\n* @Frida_Simon have potential contacts to help to get some of the equipment\n* Would mean it would be necessary to plant more flowers.\n* Collaboration with open source/DIY initiatives (through Edgeryders) to make \u201copen be hive technology workshops\u201d (open hive: http://openhivescale.org/ , https://www.osbeehives.com/collections/source-files , \u2026 )\n\n5. **Build an insect hotel:** material exists, could be turned into a workshop for work and play, or into a paid workshop for classes.\n![image|530x500](upload://ilnGqb1mvqWSVjY8hV9cXSgc9cL.jpeg) \n\n6. **Greywater System**: clean greywater from Caffe using plants\n\nGrey Water needs to be solved for Frihamnstorget in the long term view. However, we could only ever do that on a small scale as we won't have much soil. If then it would be more a limited \u201cshowroom\u201d project. We would need to be very careful to not make the place look like a swamp.\n\n11. **Funding and costs:**\n*The new PLATO project uses a \u201c[dreams and realities](https://frihamnstorget.dreams.wtf/)\u201d system similar to borderland festivals. Plans and proposals can be put up there and funding can be organised and decided that way.*\n\n**Regarding the 3000 to 4000 SEK, Blivande would be able and happy to provide that initial funding given that all of us subscribe to make the festival in September happen and amazing! :)**\n\n### Peripherally connected notes:\n\n*Stuff that came up, but is not just about the urban gardening.*\n\n1. Wifi for Frihamnstorget: Can be established easily with a signal booster from the house\n\n2. **Blivande/Frihamn could get necessary income via Festival planning/ticket selling for September:**\n\n*\u201dlet's build an amazing magic hype 600 \u2013 800 SEK for a weekend festival + access to work play at Frihamn mini membership.\u201d*\n\n* **Tickets for the festival would also give you access to work and play at Frihamnstorget.**\n\n* **Work & play**:\nPLANNED/DESIGNED EVENTS TWICE A MONTH (urban gardening and welding could be part of that)\n\n3. For the big festival, we would probably rent a bigger part of the parking lot.\n\n4. Tekniska Museet is interested in collaborating for outdoor events.\nThe museum would not pay for it, but the participants who could come through the museum could. (mainly children)\n\n5. Welding courses: 3 machines from @toby + 3 Machines we could borrow\n\n6. Connecting to maker places to \u201cheadhunt\u201d them while they can not do much in inhouse places.\n\n7. Having lockable bike storage would make the place more attractive for new members. COuld also be a welding course project.\n\n## Decisions:\n\n* **GO FOR IT** (for the pipes).\n* Urban Gardening wanted in general\n* Let\u2019s plan and create more for the festival to enable all of the other plans\n* Use Plato for the planning and financing: https://frihamnstorget.dreams.wtf/\n* *People starting initiatives like this are very cool :)*", "created_at": "2020-05-04 10:38:29.903217", "updated_at": "2020-05-04 10:40:36.052665", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 723, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 7.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [4522], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4152, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 931, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Thanks to the amazing Amalia we have this great poster.

Under de kommande tio \u00e5ren kommer det h\u00e4nda mycket i hamnen, n\u00e4r containertrafiken flyttas till Norvik och nya verksamheter fyller de tomma ytorna. Nya hus ska byggas, andra kommer rivas. Vissa verksamheter kanske flyttar ut och andra flyttar in. I tider n\u00e4r en stadsdel f\u00f6r\u00e4ndras snabbt finns det m\u00f6jlighet att ta vara p\u00e5 behovet att kommunicera med varandra och bygga ett t\u00e4tt n\u00e4tverk mellan oss som \u00e4r verksamma i hamnen. Det finns redan m\u00e5nga kreativa och innovativa m\u00e4nniskor som arbetar i Frihamnen och fler ska vi bli. T\u00e4nk vilken st\u00e4mning och sammanh\u00e5llning vi kan skapa om vi b\u00f6rjar samarbeta?\n\n## Varf\u00f6r grannsamverkan i Frihamnen?\n\nVi har en unik chans att skapa en pulserande, levande plats i mellanrummen som skapas mellan nybyggnationerna. Frihamnstorgets f\u00e4rglada containers och kommande konstgallerier \u00e4r ett f\u00f6rsta exempel. Samtidigt \u00e4r det viktigt att alla verksamheter som redan finns i Frihamnen forts\u00e4tter fungera bra med det nya som kommer. Allt det blir mycket l\u00e4ttare om vi b\u00f6rjar prata med varandra. D\u00e4rf\u00f6r har vi bjudit in er till den h\u00e4r gruppen. Vi kommer att anv\u00e4nda den f\u00f6r att l\u00e4gga upp f\u00f6rslag, diskussioner och id\u00e9er. \n\n## Vilka st\u00e5r bakom?\n\nVi som st\u00e5r bakom heter [Blivande](https://www.blivande.com), och vi driver ett hus f\u00f6r kreativt arbete, participatorisk kultur och events p\u00e5 korsningen Liljas gata och S\u00f6dra hamnv\u00e4gen i Frihamnen. Huset drivs av @hampus, @Linnea och mig [tillsammans med v\u00e5rt community](https://forum.blivande.com/t/what-have-we-been-up-to-prior-to-joining-tau/102/20). P\u00e5 parkeringen intill driver vi [Frihamnstorget](https://forum.blivande.com/t/frihamnstorget-founding-constitution/405) som vi vill l\u00e5ta blomma ut till Frihamnens nya m\u00f6tesplats och experimentverkstad f\u00f6r kultur, konst och kreativt entrepren\u00f6rskap.\n\nVi p\u00e5 Blivande anv\u00e4nder redan ett forum f\u00f6r att planera [Frihamnstorget](https://forum.blivande.com/t/frihamnstorget-founding-constitution/405) och huset [Blivande](https://forum.blivande.com/c/blivande-community).

Edgeryders och Blivande h\u00e4nger ihop genom att Edgeryders has sin nordiska bas p\u00e5 Blivande. Jag sitter i styrelsen f\u00f6r Edgeryders och @MariaEuler, verksam konstn\u00e4r i huset Blivande, jobbar ocks\u00e5 som community manager f\u00f6r Edgeryders.  \n\n## Varf\u00f6r ett forum?\n\nVi har m\u00e4rkt att ett forum \u00e4r b\u00e4ttre f\u00f6r att h\u00e5lla koll p\u00e5 m\u00e5nga tr\u00e5dar och samarbeten \u00e4n till exempel en Facebook grupp, en Slack eller en email lista. Dessutom \u00e4r det m\u00e5nga som f\u00f6rs\u00f6ker komma bort fr\u00e5n de sociala mediernas hets och larm. Det \u00e4r ocks\u00e5 m\u00e5nga arbetsplatser som inte gillar att Facebook anv\u00e4nds p\u00e5 arbetstid, och eftersom vi vill vara en plats f\u00f6r utbyte mellan f\u00f6retag och organisationer i Frihamnen k\u00e4nns det mer naturligt att ha ett forum. N\u00e4r du blivit medlem i forumet kan kan du ocks\u00e5 f\u00e5 mail n\u00e4r n\u00e5gon taggar dig, eller n\u00e4r det kommer nya tr\u00e5dar. D\u00e5 kan du svara direkt p\u00e5 mailen och de hamnar i forumet utan att du ens beh\u00f6ver logga in. \n\nVi har ocks\u00e5 skapat [en Facebook-grupp](https://www.facebook.com/groups/552703455304673) eftersom vi vet att det kan vara enklare f\u00f6r m\u00e5nga.

Finally, there will be multiple mobile tiny house modules which can work on their own or as a collection to create new living and community spaces. Porla AB provides expertise regarding installation and water systems for the project.\n\nThe 3 pioneers have already invested a lot of time and 50 000 SEK of their own money. The trailer and the skeleton of the first tiny \u201cnot (just) a sauna\u201d are standing.\n\n**The Plan for the \u201cbox of hot space\u201d:**\n\nThe plan is to cover the walls with sheets of see-through plastic and to install LED\u2019s connected to a temperature sensor as well as an AC and a heating system in the \u201chot box\u201d.\n\nThey would be happy to open this magical temperature-controlled shiny box of totally cool hot space to the community to sweat or chill together.\n\nFirst use could be a hot or cool hangout space during the festival.\n\n**What they need now:**\n\n* Help with the electronics of the trailer.\n* See-through plastic material for the walls: 30 000 SEK\n* Heating system: 10 000 SEK\n* LED\u2019s and temperature sensors: 5000 SEK\n* Help to programme those temperature sensors and LED\u2019s to reflect the atmosphere in the box.\n\n**Do you want a mobile glowing spar on Fihamnstorget?**\n\nGet in here and lend a hand or chip in some budget.

This is what we are now offering to Linda. \n\n[quote=\"Frida_Simon, post:24, topic:476\"]\nVar kan man st\u00e4lla sina saker om man har hyrt en fast plats?\n[/quote]\n\nA fixed desk also means that you have the right to put up shelves on the wall above your work station and to place some drawers next to your desk. You can also store things under your desk, or next to it. Of course, you need to be aware of the people around you and not claim more space than is reasonable. I think that it's a good rule of thumb that you can use the space around you that you can reach while sitting at your desk and all space on the wall directly above your desk. Makes sense?\n\n[quote=\"LindaNurk, post:25, topic:476\"]\nmen mina grejjer \u00e4r som sagt inte helt lukt fria, s\u00e5 fr\u00e5gan \u00e5terst\u00e5r om jag d\u00e5 ockuperar hela rummet med lukten hur alla andra st\u00e4ller sig till det?\n[/quote]\n\nI think this really remains to be seen. Of course, as with everything, we will come up with answers as we go. Smell is something that is particularly hard to predict. There might also be solutions to decrease the smell, like custom building ventilated lockers with air filters. We have a wood workshop after all. :slight_smile:", "created_at": "2019-11-12 09:30:32.480956", "updated_at": "2019-11-12 09:35:37.770212", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 413, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 48.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 2, "quotes_posts": [1899, 1902, 105], "is_reply_to": [1899, 1902], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1571, "user_id": 18, "topic_id": 394, "post_number": 5, "raw": "![69663634_2951523438196193_2027581179141554176_n|690x388](upload://bqqabDBnTEyBNKyEngreVp8ghL.jpeg) \nFound these for 500kr each.

Weather was sunny for a bit and increasingly cold. The Whiteboard was brought up to the balcony via the forklift, a very much appreciated gesture.*\n\n# Notes from Urban gardening meeting\n\n## Let\u2019s get in the greens: Urban Gardening at Frihamnstorget:\n\n*What we discussed regarding the gardening:*\n\n1. **Installing a watering system like in Tobi\u2019s balcony**. Water pipes with holes and an attached timer make it easy to care for the crops. People could plant and them not worry much more about the plants:\n![image|480x305](upload://du6Vcercw0DYdXYl19MaQ4rDyFs.jpeg) \n* Budget for water system:\n* Less than 3000 to 4000 SEK in total Material costs\n* @Thedodod  and @elch will start to set this up now either way. Thank you for the urban garden pipe heros!\n\n2. **What type of planters?**\n*Options:*\n* Cut open metal tubes\n* Like the existing wood boxes\n* Green wall structures to be made during welding course\n* Collaboration with[ \u201cHydrogarden\u201d](https://www.hydrogarden.se/) contact through @Joannis-Magnus \n*Can we/ want we collaborate with Hydrogarden setting up a shop at Frihamn to get to have a planting experiment station/demonstration station there? Hydrogarden would need to find a shop space near Frihamnstorget. Could we help them get that?*\n\n3. **Compost:** Toby will build it and we could all add to it at Frihamnen\n\n4. **Bees** : (Tobee ;)):honeybee:\n* @elch wants to get bees either way. We do not yet attach a budget. Will be explored later after more research\n* @Frida_Simon have potential contacts to help to get some of the equipment\n* Would mean it would be necessary to plant more flowers.\n* Collaboration with open source/DIY initiatives (through Edgeryders) to make \u201copen be hive technology workshops\u201d (open hive: http://openhivescale.org/ , https://www.osbeehives.com/collections/source-files , \u2026 )\n\n5. **Build an insect hotel:** material exists, could be turned into a workshop for work and play, or into a paid workshop for classes.\n![image|530x500](upload://ilnGqb1mvqWSVjY8hV9cXSgc9cL.jpeg) \n\n6. **Greywater System**: clean greywater from Caffe using plants\n\nGrey Water needs to be solved for Frihamnstorget in the long term view. However, we could only ever do that on a small scale as we won't have much soil. If then it would be more a limited \u201cshowroom\u201d project. We would need to be very careful to not make the place look like a swamp.\n\n11. **Funding and costs:**\n*The new PLATO project uses a \u201c[dreams and realities](https://dreams.wtf/)\u201d system similar to borderland festivals. Plans and proposals can be put up there and funding can be organised and decided that way.*\n\n**Regarding the 3000 to 4000 SEK, Blivande would be able and happy to provide that initial funding given that all of us subscribe to make the festival in September happen and amazing! :)**\n\n### Peripherally connected notes:\n\n*Stuff that came up, but is not just about the urban gardening.*\n\n1. Wifi for Frihamnstorget: Can be established easily with a signal booster from the house\n\n2. **Blivande/Frihamn could get necessary income via Festival planning/ticket selling for September:**\n\n*\u201dlet's build an amazing magic hype 600 \u2013 800 SEK for a weekend festival + access to work play at Frihamn mini membership.\u201d*\n\n* **Tickets for the festival would also give you access to work and play at Frihamnstorget.**\n\n* **Work & play**:\nPLANNED/DESIGNED EVENTS TWICE A MONTH (urban gardening and welding could be part of that)\n\n3. For the big festival, we would probably rent a bigger part of the parking lot.\n\n4. Tekniska Museet is interested in collaborating for outdoor events.\nThe museum would not pay for it, but the participants who could come through the museum could. (mainly children)\n\n5. Welding courses: 3 machines from @elch + 3 Machines we could borrow\n\n6. Connecting to maker places to \u201cheadhunt\u201d them while they can not do much in inhouse places.\n\n7. Having lockable bike storage would make the place more attractive for new members. COuld also be a welding course project.\n\n## Decisions:\n\n* **GO FOR IT** (for the pipes).\n* Urban Gardening wanted in general\n* Let\u2019s plan and create more for the festival to enable all of the other plans\n* Use Plato for the planning and financing, URL coming soon!\n* *People starting initiatives like this are very cool :)*\n\n![IMG_20200430_175340|666x499](upload://r5X0u0A2zln8t5YkxiJDpUmF3hu.jpeg)", "created_at": "2020-05-04 16:58:53.652387", "updated_at": "2020-10-08 02:44:43.679344", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 726, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 428.4, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 205, 15, 218], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1078, "user_id": 67, "topic_id": 275, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hi, im going to paint the top pyramid of my pyramid in gold( maybe 2.5dm2 in total).

Once corona panic has settled I will be arranging a kroki cirkel (lifedrawing cirkle) after work every Friday in the techno temple at Blivande at Frihamnen, the port of Stockholm. \n\nThe layout will be like any other lifedrawing circle with a nude modell posing in the middle and people sitting in a circle around the modell drawing. But with a little bit of a twist because there will be music and drinks for sale, giving it a little bit more of an afterwork relaxed feel. \n\nThere will be a theme each week on different drawing techniques for those who want to learn the basics of drawing, but it is also ok to just rock up and do your own thing. \n\nWe aim to cater both for those who just want to draw and those who wants to learn something - and those who wants to socialise a little.  \n\nThere will be 2, 5, 10, and 20 minutes poses for 2 hours with a 15 min break in the middle, starting from 18 - 20. People are also welcome to stay after for as long as we are open. \n\nPeople will need to bring their own materials but we provide model and pillows to sit on. Since the floor in the techno temple is already soft its not a disaster if we run out of pillows. \n\nI will be leading the first classes but I am happy to have people to help me so we can do this in shifts, that way no one is bound to attend every Friday. People needed for every shift is one model, one \"circle leader\", and one DJ/bartender. The circle leader is to tell the model when to switch poses and to introduce the course to all the participants. The DJ/bartender needs to do bartender during the break and after for those who stay after the drawing is finished to socialise. \n\nFor now I am thinking modell will get 500kr, plus tip. The circle leader and dj/bartender might get something too in the long run if this is successful, maybe 400kr per event as well. But for the first times it will only be the model that gets paid, until we get a lot of people coming.  Feel free to give your opinion about this because I am not sure what is regarded as fair by everyone. \n\nEntrance is 100 kr and food and beverage prices same as any other blivande event. \n\nRemaining profits will go towards blivande. So for the first event we have to make more than 500kr to gain profits, for future events more than 1300kr if we are to pay the rest of the arrangers. \n\nPlease let me know if you have any feedback or if you wish to be a model, circle leader or dj/barstaff. \n\nStay healthy xxxxx", "created_at": "2020-03-20 15:56:52.970283", "updated_at": "2020-03-20 16:17:50.342965", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 488, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 223.0, "like_count": 7, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 143, 186, 176, 195, 4, 15], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2847, "user_id": 119, "topic_id": 672, "post_number": 9, "raw": "Small/hand tools in tool drawer: I really like shadow boards for organising these; makes it immediately evident where to put things back.

See plans below. Input/questions welcome.\n\u2022 The wall between the current woodshop and Vins's room will be torn down. The door to Vins's former room will be blocked off.\n\u2022 Along the Southern wall (the outer wall) there will be a 7.5 m long workbench, consisting of six cabinets. One of these tailored to be suited for fine hand tool work, and another one tailored with a trench to house the chop saw. This gives us tonnes of storage space for machines, tool, hardware and so on underneath. \n\u2022 Along the same wall hand tool storage boards will be mounted across the lower portion of the windows, for easy access and good overview.\n\u2022 Along the opposite wall we'll park the stationary machines on their individual carts, from where they can easily be pulled out and placed wherever one wants to use them.\n\u2022 Above the stationary machines we can add some shelfing for longer goods.\n\u2022 Shelfing on both end walls.\n\nAs you can see on the attached excel sheet\nthe price spans on plywood in table 1 indicate various qualities of plywood. The lowest figures would mean cheaper material, but possibly some extra work and a somewhat shittier interior in the shop, whereas the more expensive end would mean quicker assembly and a nicer result. I'd personally go for the upper price range. \nDoors to the cabinets underneath the workbench would mean an additional cost as well, same gpes for the shelves. The price spans for the total cost of the shop are presented in table 2.\n\nOnce Vins has moved out of her room, we could get started with the construction of the woodshop. I suggest we do it in steps as follows:\n1. Tear down separation wall.\n2. Block off door.\n3. Do the finishing and the touch-up work on the walls.\n4. Build the cabinets and the carts in the Flamingo room\n5. Mount mirror film or similar on the windows in the woodshop. (Not included in calculation)\n6. Install cabinets and carts in the woodshop.\n7. Clean-up and treatment of wood surfaces.\n\nThen there is the financing of all this stuff...

Hope you can enjoy the sun.\nHere comes a little update from us. It's also Susannas last week at Blivande and in Stockholm before heading back to Sandviken. We are looking forward to celebrate our time together with you on Friday at Frihamnstorget. Hope to see you there! But first... What happened the last week @susannaengstrom @claes_gammelgaard @victoria_albrecht ?  \n\n**SUSANNA**\n\nNow the week is here, the last week of my internship, last week in Stockholm and at Blivande. I\u2019m very glad and grateful that I\u2019ve got to be in this creative environment and around all the wonderful people here. These two months has strengthen me as a audiovisual artist and how I can take my audiovisual art to the next level. I have been able to experimenting with the Makey Makey and Arduino and i\u2019ve been taking my time to play around with Touchdesigner a lot, which has been really fun! Now the last week I will finish my little light show, hopefully I can show you the result this friday on Play and Work somewhere in the building. This weekend I\u2019ll go home to Sandviken, take my degree and enjoy the summer on the countryside. Maybe I will come back to Stockholm this fall and continue my studies, so maybe we will see you here at Blivande in the future or somewhere else. I wish you all a wonderful summer, take good care of you!\n\n**CLAES**\n\nHej guys, this week I have explored further on the visual narrative of the new type of furniture, as well as getting closer to what it specifically looks like.  \n\nMore specifically to articulate the shape of the individual modules, sketched on their respective layout placement together, as well as the specific modul/attachment system.\n\nYou can follow along on the process journey [here].(https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15GbJ7oE_3SOi2xckXDQoEhXlnH-tVGyta4qlCGcTEEI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nTLDR; Latest pictures of the sitting furniture\n\n![42|690x338](upload://9dBGppNBG9VW0GzySe9K9dFloVh.jpeg) ![56|690x334](upload://c6GpqtHrrdrWf4NCw0EOsQX98j5.png) ![38|465x500](upload://oVfY2Rjp944myDFdBjbDQH4TqrD.png) \n\n**VICTORIA**\n\nThe AxiDraw project started with some ideas, what and how I can implement the technique and what it's possible in the display window at G\u00e4rdets subway station. Jonas connected me and Half, a developer who likes to play with different techniques to generate art with the AxiDraw. I am happy to can borrow his AxiDraw for a view weeks now and exchange i could help him with some graphic design. It's a great reminder how smooth and great community can work.\n\nJonas and me went also on the streets of Stockholm by night again to catch nice spots for our TextTypeLight project. Unfortunately almost everything we filmed last week, we have to redo because of the visual output which didn't turned out the way we wanted (troubleshooting is a to-do for this week):\n\n![06|690x224](upload://eTnz7QpbUZlrI9GOgbRUD16eWBt.png) \n*Something happened with the text files, that they aren't readable anymore.*\n\n![IMG_4541|666x500](upload://1sZ4V7HhpcZXFXYf2yD9Iwb5aNf.jpeg) ![IMG_4524|690x388](upload://6tg2Uj1w3t9zruIpzB5tlWwz0X6.jpeg) \n\nThe tricky part is that I can just check the quality of the output if I import the movie file into the software called Touchdesigner, which connect the brightest light points in a video.

We are being [funded by Vinnova](https://www.vinnova.se/p/plato-digitala-verktyg-for-participatorisk-placemaking/) to create digital tools for participatory placemaking. Blivande is heavily involved in this project and it will bring a lot of fresh energy and opportunities, especially to Frihamnstorget. [You can read the proposal here to better understand the project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/162eLn05-9HB6VGKw4Bpw-rZQJh4pwNsyCUTXYmhTgDk/edit?usp=sharing). SenseStack, the coordinator of this project, is a company set up to be an extension of [Edgeryders](https://start.edgeryders.eu/) in Stockholm, partially owned by Blivande. This post acts both as an announcement of the project to the community, and as an introduction of the Plato team to the platform. \n\n## Summary of the project\n\nPlato combines technologies that we have built for the Borderland and Edgeryders over the years into a \"suite\" of tools for placemaking. These tools include [Dreams](https://dreams.wtf/), [Realities](http://realities.theborderland.se/graph), [Graphryder](https://graphryder1.edgeryders.eu/), [Open Ethnographer](https://edgeryders.eu/t/open-ethnographer-manual/6811), and Discourse (this forum). We will integrate all of these tools with each other, allow them to share data, and enable a single login to all of them through the account a user has on the forum.\n\nWe will use this suite of tools to activate Frihamnstorget, to map out the different projects and their budgets, map out the different responsibilities and their dependencies, document contacts with authorities and build a great community. Frihamnstorget will get its own Dreams platform, Realities platform and the conversations on the forum will be visualized in a graph showing the connections between people, ideas and projects. We use this forum as the starting point and all platforms will integrate with the forum through a single login.\n\nWe will also use Frihamnstorget as a place for experimentation for students at Stockholm University, studying placemaking and participatory urban planning. During their education, these students will use Plato and participate in developing the methodology and feedback on the UX/UI.\n\nFinally, these tools and methods will be documented, and a proposal written for how it can be used by municipalities, schools, real estate developers and other organizations. Our goal is to turn this technology and methodology into a product that we can sell, providing an income for Blivande and for people in the community.\n\n## Work packages\n\n### WP1: Software development\nThis is approximately 50% of the budget, including programming, UX/UI work, project management and overhead costs like seats at Blivande for the developers.\n\n### WP2: Study into implementation potential\nThis part of the project is carried out by Ylva and Diana and will take place during the second half of the project.\n\n### WP3: Workshops\nThese are workshops we will do with Stockholm University and Frihamnstorget creators to plan new developments. These workshops will also have a production budget tied to them that we can use to make Dreams into Realities.\n\n### WP4: Implementation of Plato on Frihamnstorget\nWe use the tools we develop for Frihamnstorget. This work package includes budgets for project management of Frihamnstorget (@hampus), online/offline community management and ethnography. \n\n## Plato team (so far)\n\nI will be leading the project together with @jakobskote. Roughly, I will focus on delivering the technology and Jakob will focus on delivering the methodology. Our split of hours is to be determined, but I will most likely be working on the project a bit more than Jakob. \n\n@hampus will be leading practical work at Frihamnstorget, and of making sure that everyone who is working at Frihamnstorget gets onboarded to the Plato platform. \n\n@gustav is our first hire as a developer and he will be working around half time on Plato throughout the project. He has recently been working on the new Dreams and has worked on Realities before that. \n\n[Ragnar Lund](https://www.su.se/profiles/ralu3052-1.191473) is our collaborator at Stockholm University, where he teaches placemaking in two courses.\n\n[Ylva Bj\u00f6rnberg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ylvabjornberg/?originalSubdomain=se) and [Diana Uppman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diana-uppman-25734992/) (yet to join the platform) will be in charge of writing the report on how to scale Plato and turn it into an offer for municipalities and other organizations.\n\n[Amelia Hassoun](https://edgeryders.eu/t/amelia-hassoun/10934) will be our expert advisor on ethnography, both on how it is done on the platform and also on how to do it specifically for participatory urbanism.\n\n## People we want to involve soon\n\n@MariaEuler, I would love to involve you in both forum community management of the Blivande/Frihamnstorget forum, and in other aspects too. It would be fantastic to have you on this project with us. Let me know if there is anything you are particularly interested in. We have budget earmarked for community management.\n\n@SofiaAnner and I have already talked about her being involved, as she is already working closely with @hampus, @Sero and me on outreach and engagement for Blivande.\n\n@matthias and @daniel, there is plenty of Discourse work here. I would love to work with you on this if you have the time. We will want to use Edgeryders as the SSO server, develop plugins to display information from Dreams and Realities on the Discourse front-end.\n \n@Frida_Simon, it would be great to involve you as someone who is both building art at Frihamnstorget and as someone who has a lot of experience in the field.\n\nAll members are very welcome to think about if and how they would like to contribute to the project. I would also love to involve the creative powers of \n and the Node (@kimgajraj). \n\nIf you want to be involved somehow, this is the time to let us know. To manage expectations, most of the budget is earmarked for software development and major project management roles, so you will probably not be paid in this project unless you are highly engaged and take responsibility for delivery. Importantly, many of us who have been working on Blivande for free can now get paid salaries temporarily through this project, which is a huge relief. However, there are plenty of ways that this project can work for you and what you want to do, even if its is not in a paid role. \n\nPerhaps you want to plan a big event at Frihamnstorget and we can set up a Dreams instance for you? Perhaps you are planning to do something very complicated that requires a lot of people to stay in the loop, and you could benefit from project management through realities? Or perhaps you want to use the PR-value of having Edgeryders and a Vinnova-funded project and plan a participatory art event that you sell tickets to and apply to grants for? Let's try to make this project sprout a thousand beautiful tentacles for the community.\n\n## Timeline\n\nWe will be ramping up in April and should be up and running in May. This project will be ongoing until June 2021. In the first phase, from April to June, we will be mostly focused on project planning and software development. Ideally, we can use these tools to launch a participatory build festival week for Frihamnstorget this summer. \n\n## Next steps \n\nWe need to gather our core teams, set up some timelines and get to work. @jakobskote and I will reach out soon with some more information.\n\nFinally, announcing the project like this is a part of how we work at Blivande and at Edgeryders.

A box internally covered with mirrors, showcased in the form of an immersive experience. Unfortunately we couldn't get the box out of Ukraine due to the crazy transportation costs. \n\nLooked like this:\n![09|329x500](upload://xGggNxKKHZx8koq7HiACKWNds6H.png) \n\nTherefore we're right now looking into how to build the Mirror Box 2.0, in a space where the box could be somewhat \"permanent\". After an idea planted in my head by @jakobskote, me and Jonas started to look into the possibilities of creating the installation inside of a container - and right now we're really optimistic about this.\n\nWe would really love our artwork to be more of a communal space, that could be used by the community around Blivande for workshops, public events, container mini-raves or wherever your imagination takes you! We want the box to come to **life** and not being some temporarily object in a gallery. We would love to build a container version of the box at Frihamnstorget!\n\nI've read most of the info about the Frihamnstorget project and hope that someone could point me in the right direction from here to get things rolling!

This was because the NC program at this point contained an awful amount of very, very small path segments. The machine controller simply couldn't keep up with processing all those commands with any reasonable speed. \n\nThis was really my mistake rushing the program out too quickly.

We all had the pleasure of spending two fantastic months at Blivande. I couldn't wished for more when I entered these doors a few weeks ago. Blivande was filled with people willing to help in uncertain and needing times. And the past weeks I was happy to see more and more smiling faces coming back to their daily routines in the house.\n\nI would like to thank you all to meeting us with helpful hands, smiles and inspiring conversations through a time of experimenting and learning. A big part of making my experiences so rich is the support, knowledge and enthusiasm of you @jonasjohansson. Thank you for being transparent and sharing so much with us! You're an awesome human being. \n\nOur TEXT TYPE LIGHT project is still ongoing and we can hopefully share all results soon with you guys.

See you soon!\nHugs / Victoria\n\nAnd in **CLAES**  words does that mean: \n\nTo close this chapter I need to start with thanking @jonasjohansson. For his inspiration, tremendous understanding and his never ending support in helping me whenever it was requested. Then of course a huge thank you to Blivande as a community for always meeting me with smiles and faith. For being awesome and finding new ways. And for your inspiration and positivity. I have a lot of respect for you. Although this internship is ending I hope I come back somehow. I would be happy to come back and potentially facilitate a think tank. etc. \n\nTwo projects during this internship:\n\n1.

But Blivande isn\u2019t just a business, its also a congregation and a place of non-profit co-creation. A home away from home which we want to be open for play and adventure.
