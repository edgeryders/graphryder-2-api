It also has educational and therapeutic value that has been used in several organizations in the United States to works with individuals recovering from breast cancer or PTSD. It is also used to get children outside and connect them to their environments.\nWe will do a demo workshop on fly fishing, involving a local school and participants of the festival can also join. The group will go to a body of water close by and learn fly fishing techniques. The fly fishing is also a way into learning about environment, physics, biology and your surroundings.\nThe session can be supplemented with citizen science research on water quality, through biotic index (measuring water quality through the type and amount of living organisms in the water) or microbiotic activity (measuring the type and amount of micro-organisms).\nAs the group will be diverse and there are multiple things to do, we\u2019ll work with a rotation, so that everyone gets to do a little of everything.\nThe session should not be limited to the festival for its impact. It would be good if this format can be reused by other schools.

Imagine you like classic two guitars-bass-drums rock music. Well, that technology scales really well: you can enjoy a rock concert in a bar with an audience of 30 people, or in a football stadium with an audience of 80,000. The costs of giving a concert increases in the size of the audience, but much slower than the ticket revenues. If you double your audience, your profit does not double: it goes up fourfold, or even tenfold, depends on where you start. Markets with these characteristics are called winner-takes-it-all: they produce few superstars, with everyone else doing badly (Rosen's classic 1981 paper).

Consideration of citizen-led care responses will take us into a process of renegotiating the roles and responsibilities of the citizen and the state.\u00a0\nA number of threads of\u00a0conversation\u00a0touched on this issue of responsibility. @Alberto\u00a0referenced the Amish refusal of health insurance on the grounds that it \u2018de-responsibilises\u2019 people. Conversation with Wendy Ball explored her recent intervention in a street fight and how \u2018externalising responsibility\u2019 for care creates dependency on state responses -\u00a0turning us into passive subjects. This lack of agency can become crippling and is a symptom of how 'de-responsibilised' we've become.", "created_at": "2017-07-08 14:30:45", "updated_at": "2017-07-08 14:30:45", "tag_id": 1860, "post_id": 6462, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 6429}, {"id": 11500, "text": null, "quote": "Totally agree with this.

This story serves as a first encounter with Edgeryders. It also includes written reflections by Vanessa.\n\nWeMHNurses hosts regular mental health themed twitter chats, as part of a network chat calendar, with wildly diverse topics ranging from \u201cThe use of digital technology in everyday practice\u201d to \u201cWorkplace democracy in mental health\u201d. The core team runs the day to day operations, on a purely voluntary basis, with the WeMHNurses account, also linking into the wider WeCommunities, which covers many different branches of Nursing and Health Care professions and specialism. Topics for chats tend to mostly emerge from topical conversations within the community or where there is, for example a national policy directive or key piece of published journalism relating to mental health. The community also run sponsored chats for national bodies such as the Dept of Health, Care Quality Commission and NHS England. The WeMHNurses team see their role as being about facilitating broader conversation in a democratised digital space, where everyone can have a voice, regardless of positional authority. The team also see their role as being to make national policy more accessible, in terms of the language being used. The community also has a particular focus on discussing the everyday implications of policy on mental health nursing practice.\n\nThe chats are generally facilitated by one of the @WeMHNurses team, with guests are often invited to participate in the chat where the person brings specific expertise to the conversation. This is an open process, whereby anyone can contact the team to suggest a chat topic or to ask to host a chat.The team provide support to individuals who want to host a chat from the @WeMHNurses Twitter handle.\n\nOur ethos is very much that \u201cyour opinion matters\u201d and we focus on the user point of view, getting people talking to each other and bringing a variety of perspectives to the conversation. We enjoy working with people who have previously been in services or are currently in services because we really value the lived experience perspective. As we are an independent voice, we will also cover topics that might be considered controversial, political or critical, as we believe that these conversations are important in setting the future direction for mental health nursing.\n\nOn reflection, we think that the liveliest and most informative chats are often where there is a real mixture of perspectives, including for example, clinicians, people accessing services, managers, leaders, academics, researchers and policy makers. The conversations that we have online are often very powerful for this reason as we can\u2019t think of many examples from our own professional lives, where there has been such a variety of voices in a room to debate a topic in such a level and democratic way. An example of this is a chat that Vanessa and Mark ran with the Health Service Journal, where we discussed the reduction of inpatient mental health beds across the country. This chat was very much brought to life by people sharing their experiences of how this impacted on them personally when they needed to access inpatient care.\n\nThe demographics for our chat suggest that we have a largely UK audience. However, because of the global reach of Twitter, we do have some international representation within our community and we love to encourage this because of the dimension that it brings to the conversation\n\nBefore we run a chat, we produce some pre chat information on the wecommunities website. This is generally written in a blog style, so it is broadly accessible reading. We are also looking at how we can make our chats even more inclusive, such as by providing audio for people who struggle to read or who have visual impairment. The challenge for us is that we are all volunteers, so we have to find ways of delivering information quickly.\n\nHow come this twitter format for talking about mental health? Is there something in the medium that helps learning, or alleviation for individuals?\n\nAs with everything there are always pros and cons. Some would say \u201cthere\u2019s only so many characters on twitter\u201d and mental health can be a very complex topic to discuss with limited characters, especially when people are talking about personal experience. On the other hand, it can help you be more focused and concise in what you are trying to say.\n\nI suppose using twitter to talk about mental health is quite personal, as is twitter use in general. There are many who find it hugely therapeutic and helpful, either getting involved in chats, communicating/ networking with others or for gaining support. It is a fab place for the sharing of information, including research and it's also a great forum for challenging stigma and moving the mental health agenda forward.\n\n\nWeMHNurses1_0.png900x480 120 KB\n\n\nWordcloud from\u00a0participants twitter bios in a recent chat -\u00a0source.\n\nIs there a cutoff number for participants in a chat? Or a number that makes it effective? I\u2019m wondering because you have such high regularity - every week.\n\nThere is not a maximum number of people in each chat, it can be anybody using the hashtag. Often people pop into the chat with just one or two tweets, whilst at the same time, we are having a conversation with other people, who participate in the entirety of the chat. When you are facilitating a chat, which is busy, it can be a challenge responding to every single tweet, but we do try to do this and often we find that people branch off and have separate conversations with other participants, within the chat, which goes down a different path to the structured questions of the main chat. Providing they still use the hashtag, we still capture this conversation in the transcript at the end. This is an example of the latest archived chat on a Tuesday evening, counting 133 contributors, 1200 tweets and with a reach of 7,561,098! This was a joint chat with @wenurses and @weldnurses.\n\nWith our over 6000 followers, plus the wider network, I suppose it is hard to say how many people we reach constantly. However, analytics for the chat are captured within the wecommunities website. Nick Chinn is the technical person behind this at Wecommunities.\n\nWhat do you think draws people in? What makes it a community for you? Is it people interacting with each other, learning, figuring out stuff?\n\nI suppose it is all of that. Everyone involved in the chats is interested in that particular area and that shared interest drives the discussions and questions in the chat, which will often support the development of links between people. Often people in the chats might say: \u2018this is a good chat\u2019, and \u2018why don\u2019t we do one on this other topic area?\u2019 It then keeps expanding, and there are more things that we get involved in. So, in essence, the community is about sharing knowledge and learning, being open to thinking in different ways and developing a support network as well.\n\nWhat for the future and how can we support your work?\n\nWe are\u00a0very aware that people establish relationships and friendships offline with people who they have connected with on Twitter and that these relationships are often a great source of strength and support for people. Vanessa and Teresa Chinn, Founder of WeCommunities organised an unConference earlier in the year, through crowdfunding, which brought together 300 people from the community into a physical space to get together and to debate and discuss the future direction of social media in health care. We also provided a parallel online agenda throughout the day, so that the twitter community could still very much be part of it, even if they couldn\u2019t physically attend. Vanessa and Mark from WeMHNurses and Mental Elf on Twitter are also in the process of setting up a Digital mental health conference service, which we are launching at #PDDigital16 later in November.", "created_at": "2017-11-28 21:02:23.287989", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:31:40.053746", "tag_id": 1127, "post_id": 551, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 518}, {"id": 18824, "text": "", "quote": "Ahoj, d\u00edky moc za sd\u00edlen\u00ed Tv\u00e9 zku\u0161enosti, zn\u00ed to teda dost stra\u0161ideln\u011b...M\u016f\u017eu se zeptat, jak si se k t\u00e9 pan\u00ed nakonec dostala?

It is frequently in our papers and on our televisions, yet beyond the UK and the direct environment of Calais the Calais camp has not received the kind of attention it deserves.\u2018The Jungle\u2019, as it has become known, is a large camp on the edge of the Calais port area. It sits on top of a series of sand dunes, small lakes and wastelands on the very edge of the French coastline, right by the lorry parking area at the port. Before it was settled it was an industrial dumping ground, and previous checks of the ground have found traces of heavy metallic elements like Cobalt, as well as large amounts of old asbestos panelling that had broken down.On top of all this sits a huge camp for migrants and displaced people from around the world. At last count it stood at around 4900 people, most of whom are trying to claim asylum in the UK.At it\u2019s largest point shortly after Christmas the camp had over 6000 residents. Living in very harsh, cold conditions through the Northern Europe winter.Originally the camp was made up of tents and very temporary structures. But from around September last year a number of new charity organisations and volunteer structures made it their plans to help improve the quality of the camp [http://www.ahomeforwinter.org/].The camp is largely made up of young men, although there are small numbers of families, women and young children as well as around 350 unaccompanied children between the age of 12-16. A number of organisations sprang up that work with the women and children on site, provided youth clubs, teaching and English lessons. [http://www.calaidipedia.co.uk/camp-initiatives] [http://www.calaisjungleyouth.com/]The camp has grown up, physically and mentally, over the last 5 years, but has really become a focal point since around 2012. The camp has grown hugely during this time, as well as moving around from site to site.Alongside the humanitarian and social aid there are library and reading services [http://www.calaidipedia.co.uk/jungle-books-library], theatre and arts activities [http://goodchance.org.uk/], community kitchens [https://www.facebook.com/OneSpiritAshramKitchen/][https://www.facebook.com/The-Belgian-Kitchen-1736739086546935/], hot food distribution, dry food goods distribution and daily clothing distributions provided from a central warehouse [http://www.laubergedesmigrants.fr/], amongst many others [http://time.com/4233206/calais-jungle-shops/].You can find out more about a numbers of the organisations that work on the site by visiting [http://www.calaidipedia.co.uk/breaking-news] or by reading the No Borders document [https://welcometocalais.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/welcome-to-calais-booklet_eng_updatedoct15.pdf]Although MSF, GWB and Unicef run services on the site, and have provided some care to the camps the site itself is not officially recognised by the French or UK governments, and as such has no requirements to meet basic human rights, or follow local building or health and safety guidelines.As a result, no single government or NGO organisation has responsibility for the activities and structures on camp. Everything that has grown up has happened through self-organisation, communication and collaboration between new and existing charities both French-based and in the UK.Increasingly we are seeing aid, and charities from further afield in Europe coming to Calais to help, creating a multi-national series of solutions that have grown up without any direct hierarchy or guidance.In March the French prefecture with the support of the CRS cleared the oldest, largest section of the camp in the south. The intention was to rehouse all of the residents in to a number of local official options; including the La Vie Active container camp [http://julesferry.vieactive.fr/]; the brand new official refugee camp in Dunkirk [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/12186407/Frances-first-ever-internationally-recognised-refugee-camp-opens-near-Dunkirk.html] or into asylum/detention camps around France.The majority of residents in the camp chose to not take these options as they are not looking to seek asylum in France, but are trying to get to the UK to reconnect with families. This disconnect between what the French authorities want to achieve with the residents and what the residents themselves want to achieve goes a long way toward explaining the conflict and central problem at the camp.About what i have been doingFor the past 3 weeks I have been working as a volunteer through the central warehouse, L\u2019Auberge des migrants.L\u2019Auberge acts as the central aid and food distribution services for the camps across Northern France, including Calais, Dunkirk and a number of smaller camps around the area.L\u2019Auberge exists solely on donations, providing daily hot food deliveries, daily dry food deliveries to allow residents to cook for themselves, clothing drops, and since my arrival a mobile distribution service that goes from shelter to shelter, assessing individual and community needs and providing aid in the form of blankets, sleeping bags, cooking equipment, lights and a number of other personal items.All of these services are coordinated by long to medium term volunteers, who spend their own money and time to care for the people on camp without receiving any direct pay. Sometimes fundraised money is spent to provide accommodation and travel expenses to volunteers but a large majority of people live out here entirely on the own funds.The warehouse was initially set up by a French charity but is now run and \u2018staffed\u2019 by a UK charity HelpRefugees [http://www.helprefugees.org.uk/what-we-do/], who bring in funding and support from around the EU to help provide humanitarian services.http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/03/burying-refugees-die-calais-jungle-160329071028796.htmlTO BE CONTINUED.", "created_at": "2019-03-21 09:01:16.153606", "updated_at": "2019-09-17 09:52:31.942844", "tag_id": 3902, "post_id": 39328, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 7651}, {"id": 18871, "text": "", "quote": "P\u0159esun do Vinohradsk\u00e9 nemocnice, kde mi doktor ozn\u00e1m\u00ed - nadvakr\u00e1t zlomen\u00fd kotn\u00edk a p\u0159etrhan\u00e9 vazy...

This story serves as a first encounter with Edgeryders. It also includes written reflections by Vanessa.\n\nWeMHNurses hosts regular mental health themed twitter chats, as part of a network chat calendar, with wildly diverse topics ranging from \u201cThe use of digital technology in everyday practice\u201d to \u201cWorkplace democracy in mental health\u201d. The core team runs the day to day operations, on a purely voluntary basis, with the WeMHNurses account, also linking into the wider WeCommunities, which covers many different branches of Nursing and Health Care professions and specialism. Topics for chats tend to mostly emerge from topical conversations within the community or where there is, for example a national policy directive or key piece of published journalism relating to mental health. The community also run sponsored chats for national bodies such as the Dept of Health, Care Quality Commission and NHS England. The WeMHNurses team see their role as being about facilitating broader conversation in a democratised digital space, where everyone can have a voice, regardless of positional authority. The team also see their role as being to make national policy more accessible, in terms of the language being used. The community also has a particular focus on discussing the everyday implications of policy on mental health nursing practice.\n\nThe chats are generally facilitated by one of the @WeMHNurses team, with guests are often invited to participate in the chat where the person brings specific expertise to the conversation. This is an open process, whereby anyone can contact the team to suggest a chat topic or to ask to host a chat.The team provide support to individuals who want to host a chat from the @WeMHNurses Twitter handle.\n\nOur ethos is very much that \u201cyour opinion matters\u201d and we focus on the user point of view, getting people talking to each other and bringing a variety of perspectives to the conversation. We enjoy working with people who have previously been in services or are currently in services because we really value the lived experience perspective. As we are an independent voice, we will also cover topics that might be considered controversial, political or critical, as we believe that these conversations are important in setting the future direction for mental health nursing.\n\nOn reflection, we think that the liveliest and most informative chats are often where there is a real mixture of perspectives, including for example, clinicians, people accessing services, managers, leaders, academics, researchers and policy makers. The conversations that we have online are often very powerful for this reason as we can\u2019t think of many examples from our own professional lives, where there has been such a variety of voices in a room to debate a topic in such a level and democratic way. An example of this is a chat that Vanessa and Mark ran with the Health Service Journal, where we discussed the reduction of inpatient mental health beds across the country. This chat was very much brought to life by people sharing their experiences of how this impacted on them personally when they needed to access inpatient care.\n\nThe demographics for our chat suggest that we have a largely UK audience. However, because of the global reach of Twitter, we do have some international representation within our community and we love to encourage this because of the dimension that it brings to the conversation\n\nBefore we run a chat, we produce some pre chat information on the wecommunities website. This is generally written in a blog style, so it is broadly accessible reading. We are also looking at how we can make our chats even more inclusive, such as by providing audio for people who struggle to read or who have visual impairment. The challenge for us is that we are all volunteers, so we have to find ways of delivering information quickly.\n\nHow come this twitter format for talking about mental health? Is there something in the medium that helps learning, or alleviation for individuals?\n\nAs with everything there are always pros and cons. Some would say \u201cthere\u2019s only so many characters on twitter\u201d and mental health can be a very complex topic to discuss with limited characters, especially when people are talking about personal experience. On the other hand, it can help you be more focused and concise in what you are trying to say.\n\nI suppose using twitter to talk about mental health is quite personal, as is twitter use in general. There are many who find it hugely therapeutic and helpful, either getting involved in chats, communicating/ networking with others or for gaining support. It is a fab place for the sharing of information, including research and it's also a great forum for challenging stigma and moving the mental health agenda forward.\n\n\nWeMHNurses1_0.png900x480 120 KB\n\n\nWordcloud from\u00a0participants twitter bios in a recent chat -\u00a0source.\n\nIs there a cutoff number for participants in a chat? Or a number that makes it effective? I\u2019m wondering because you have such high regularity - every week.\n\nThere is not a maximum number of people in each chat, it can be anybody using the hashtag. Often people pop into the chat with just one or two tweets, whilst at the same time, we are having a conversation with other people, who participate in the entirety of the chat. When you are facilitating a chat, which is busy, it can be a challenge responding to every single tweet, but we do try to do this and often we find that people branch off and have separate conversations with other participants, within the chat, which goes down a different path to the structured questions of the main chat. Providing they still use the hashtag, we still capture this conversation in the transcript at the end. This is an example of the latest archived chat on a Tuesday evening, counting 133 contributors, 1200 tweets and with a reach of 7,561,098! This was a joint chat with @wenurses and @weldnurses.\n\nWith our over 6000 followers, plus the wider network, I suppose it is hard to say how many people we reach constantly. However, analytics for the chat are captured within the wecommunities website. Nick Chinn is the technical person behind this at Wecommunities.\n\nWhat do you think draws people in? What makes it a community for you? Is it people interacting with each other, learning, figuring out stuff?\n\nI suppose it is all of that. Everyone involved in the chats is interested in that particular area and that shared interest drives the discussions and questions in the chat, which will often support the development of links between people. Often people in the chats might say: \u2018this is a good chat\u2019, and \u2018why don\u2019t we do one on this other topic area?\u2019 It then keeps expanding, and there are more things that we get involved in. So, in essence, the community is about sharing knowledge and learning, being open to thinking in different ways and developing a support network as well.\n\nWhat for the future and how can we support your work?\n\nWe are\u00a0very aware that people establish relationships and friendships offline with people who they have connected with on Twitter and that these relationships are often a great source of strength and support for people. Vanessa and Teresa Chinn, Founder of WeCommunities organised an unConference earlier in the year, through crowdfunding, which brought together 300 people from the community into a physical space to get together and to debate and discuss the future direction of social media in health care. We also provided a parallel online agenda throughout the day, so that the twitter community could still very much be part of it, even if they couldn\u2019t physically attend. Vanessa and Mark from WeMHNurses and Mental Elf on Twitter are also in the process of setting up a Digital mental health conference service, which we are launching at #PDDigital16 later in November.", "created_at": "2017-11-29 18:20:06.574327", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:31:42.038557", "tag_id": 1233, "post_id": 551, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 518}, {"id": 16403, "text": "", "quote": "Also one of the people mentioned who was the \"expert\" on one of those RT alarmist shows,  \" On Feb. 7, a segment claimed that \u201c5G Tech is \u2018Crime under International Law.\u2019\u201d Its featured expert was Arthur Firstenberg, who once charged that a neighbor\u2019s wireless gear had hurt his health.

We practice a sort of open notebook science.\u00a0We don't publish only results, but also questions, doubts, within-team disagreements, half-baked ideas. This is made more effective by a specificity of OpenCare:\u00a0the community and the team are in separate \"rooms\" of the same online platform, edgeryders.eu. People who hang around it\u00a0can't help noticing the stream of research project updates. Some of them engage.\u00a0\n\nThis was expected. But I was not expecting the magnitude of the effect. 81 people have contributed at least one comment to the research team space. The team's own numerosity fluctuates, but it's about 20. The others are just people from the community who drop in to ask questions or make suggestions. And they outnumber us three to one.\n\nIn the network diagrams, nodes are color- and size coded by in-degree. You can think of in-degree as a measure of the interest that the person's contribution elicits in the conversation. By this metric, it is clear that self-selected community members who just jump in\u00a0are making a major contribution to the OpenCare research effort. The highest in-degree individuals who are not affiliated with any of the partners are @Federico_Monaco (ranks 7th by in-degree), @Rune (ranks 13th) and @Francesco_Maria_ZAVA (ranks 16th).\u00a0\n\nThe conversation about\u00a0OpenCare as a project (to the right of the picture)\u00a0is of the same order of magnitude as that about open care as a potential pathway to societal well-being (to the left). It needs to be said, however, that the former has a lot of menial content: agreeing about a time and place to meet, requesting administrative information etc. \u00a0\n\nWhat are the consequences of all this activity? More diversity in research. More space for participation. With a bit of luck, more and higher quality scientific output.\u00a0My favourite story is this: a community member, the already mentioned Federico Monaco, has proposed we do a paper together. He had found a call for papers in a journal he follows, and thought it a good fit. His proposal stirred the rest of the team into action. His thread received over 50 comments. A\u00a0draft abstract was then uploaded onto a public wiki\u00a0for community scrutiny and feedback.\n\nMany people sent contributions large and small. The large ones (example: that of\u00a0Ezio \u2013 here) did most of the heavy lifting. But the process had a role also for smaller ones. People like myself, who did not feel confident to step in as co-authors, were able to offer some small help\u00a0without having to take responsbility for the whole thing. Federico led with a firm but light touch, asking everyone who volunteered any thought what role they wanted to play in the paper. For example, @Yannick \u2013 also\u00a0not\u00a0a member of the OpenCare team \u2013 was offered co-authorship (but declined). All of this happened out in the open. As you\u00a0read the whole thread, you can see ideas form through the discussion of the co-authors. Collective intelligence about collective intelligence!\u00a0\n\nInterdisciplinarity happened quite naturally as a result of the open process. The final submission listed five authors: Federico himself (a medical anthropologist); @Ezio_Manzini (a designer for social innovation); @Noemi (a social scientist); @Amelia (an ethnographer); myself (a network scientist). How cool is that?\n\nAnother advantage of doing things this way is increased accountability to the people who take part\u00a0in the main conversation, the one about care. Through the research team forum, they can ask question and make proposals. This should mitigate the perceived risk of researchers taking an exploitative attitude towards people's contributions. The operative word here is \"perceived\". We have the best intentions, but we recognize this is not enough. We are determined to demonstrate them to the community, and transparency goes a long way towards doing it.\u00a0\n\nI think that, together, we are making OpenCare... open. I had never had the luxury of running a research project with such transparency. I like it a lot, and hope to keep doing so in the future.

Alex and Sammy hired good writers with a degree to write custom papers. My friends in Virginia were promoting our writing service on campus. We started to receive multiple orders. We were helping people who had troubles with their writing.

In this way, the tool is designed for physicians, but the main benefits will come for migrating patients whose this services is dedicated to.\n\n\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/embed/MZSMi316E-Y\n\n\n\n\n\tSolution, brief description of the project\n\n\n\n\nResQ is a mobile management tool that improves the communication among healthcare workers (especially physicians, but also volunteers, nurses etc etc...), getting as a result the reduction of the language barrier that very often doesn\u2019t allow foreign patient to fully explain their symptoms or their own pathologies.\n\nThe personal pathological condition besides being a psychological kind of weight, for instance when a patient has to explain multiple times his/her condition to a series of different medical specialists, it could also lead to misinterpretation and diagnosis issues when there might be a language barrier.\n\nResQ is conceived to to be used mainly during the period in which the migrant still doesn\u2019t own a \u201cCodice Fiscale\u201d (personal unique fiscal code), but only a STP card (Straniero Temporaneamente Presente), that makes her/ him able to benefit from the main national healthcare services (for 12 months maximum).\n\nThe reception centers that provide the STP card and give the first medical assistance, have to deal with a very high number of people in a stressful situation that often lead to a superficial treatment.\n\nIn this way we designed an agile gathering data tool that saves time and in few minutes would be able to fulfill a complete health history of the patients. Also, the digitalization of such a document would make possible an extensive sharing with colleagues that later will take care of the same patient.\n\nTherefore the physician will have the chance to communicate autonomously among themselves without misunderstanding through the management tool.\n\n\nResQ-board.jpg2045x2500 640 KB\n\n\n\n\n\n\tTechnologies we will adopt\n\n\n\n\nThe tool we are designing will be developed in order to be accessible from the main devices available on the market. Therefore we envision applications possibly developed in their native languages as Java or Android and Objective-C foe iOS ambients.\n\nEven though we believe a mobile tool might be most suitable solution for the specific usage context we are working on, we would like to provide also a multi-platform responsive app developed in HTML5.\n\nThe cloud service might be developed in NodeJS, with database in MongoDB and MySQL.", "created_at": "2017-11-29 18:35:56.437583", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:31:42.818684", "tag_id": 1271, "post_id": 866, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 833}, {"id": 17458, "text": "", "quote": "Leaving Emilia, and then leaving Italy, did not mean", "created_at": "2019-11-15 17:29:57.770078", "updated_at": "2020-09-03 15:09:57.967315", "tag_id": 5522, "post_id": 64260, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 9369}, {"id": 18887, "text": "", "quote": "Absolvoval jsem druhou operaci na soukrom\u00e9 klinice (st\u00e1la 20 000,-), pozd\u011bji mi byly nab\u00edzeny inijekce s kyselinou hyaluronovou pro rychlej\u0161\u00ed regeneraci (jedna aplikace cca za 6000,-).

It seems people in such projects envisage sharing a carer as they get to the point of needing help. I'm not sure of the viability of staying in such a place when serious dementia\u00a0 or physical ailments start to occur; equally regular medication may require a qualified nurse and preventative care may require qualified staff on hand 24/7.\nAgain, I do think we need to start thinking about things in terms of the housing we are building. We can't just keep building homes for young families or \"trendy\" flats for young single people. We need to seriously consider social housing, mixed communities, purpose-built homes for the elderly, etc. Mixed housing should be mandatory for large-scale new build schemes, and not just a tiny number of \"affordable flats\" that the developer can negotiate to build in a completely different city (as is happening now in the UK!). Also social attitudes and culture need to move on; young people and families need to see a mixed community as an asset, that can bring wisdom and care for their own children within easy reach, rather than seeing it as something they wouldn't really be interested in.\nI'd listen to my previous post above on the actual issues of budgets, who pays for what when interacting with the powers-that-be, etc. What I can say from these initial cohousing projects is that they're a start, but don't yet seem to consider serious (legally covered) nursing care.\n(Are you aware of companies like McCarthy and Stone who build retirement homes, by the way? Perhaps schemes like that could be a way to progress the idea of cohousing and start people living together, with care facilities and good environments provided on top of their existing model.)\n(Final thought - have done some volunteer work in a day care centre for adults with learning difficulties before... Perhaps a similar model, with day facilities and night care facilities built separately, or being more intermingled than just nursing home residents gathered in their particular nursing homes 24/7, would be a good idea. Those who were more capable could use cooking facilities, make and create, etc. whilst in their \"day environment,\" and other age groups or people living in the local area could also come and use such facilities / interact / assist? Again, funding would be an issue, especially in our current environment of service cuts and the loss of community centres and other such facilities. However, in the long run, I do think such things could prove to save money by keeping people active and involved. (Been reading something else today on the fact that inadequate checks on the elderly costs the NHS \u00a32bn per annum due to resultant falls! So even a weekly visit to a local centre, or some interaction / activity, could prevent such things and incorporate some very simple checks - asking how they are balance-wise, quick check on visual acuity...)\nAgain - the major issue is the fact that we don't have joined up thinking, but increasing fragmentation in health and social care. Each individual element is asked to cut costs and reduce facilities, even if that results in massive costs elsewhere...\nI better stop at this point, or I'll get political again", "created_at": "2017-02-10 20:45:15", "updated_at": "2017-02-10 20:45:15", "tag_id": 437, "post_id": 29962, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 725}, {"id": 11549, "text": null, "quote": "at \"Our Place\" event we brought yoga by Green Lotus Galway (GLG) and circus workshops for kids by Hoopla Troupla\u00a0 (social inclusion in a socio-economically disadvantaged area).\nat What Now?

When ever an adolescent brings up a topic around \u00a0reproductive health or sex \u00a0education, they are usually severely punished \u00a0and regarded as been disrespectful to their elders. Due to this absence of discussion on sex education, many adolescent young girls face lots of challenges and stigma at their puberty stage, especially during menstruation.Most parents in Cameroon especially in the rural and grassroots areas, don't know that they have to provide pads for their girl children during menstruation. They don't even give their girls advice when these children even summon a little courage to inform them that something abnormal is happening with them .According to many parents, these children are very immature and still very young to be able to handle understand and process issues on puberty , reproductive health and menstruation. Because of this lack of discussion between parents and children on sex education, many of these girls, during menstruation are forced to stay away from school because of stigma from boys who often notice blood stains on their uniforms and also the unpleasant odor which \u00a0cames out of the bodies as a result. \u00a0Their staying away from school, makes them not to be performant as they ought to be like the boys and this plays a key role for their poor performances. Some stay away for two weeks and others for a month, just to avoid this stigma. As a youth advocate to encourage parent children dialogue on sex education and advoacting for Access to reproductive health knowledge, i have had time to hold some trainings with a few groups of adolescent girls to tell me about their experiences. \u00a0As a result of lack of menstrual hygiene, due to absence of \u00a0dialogue between them and their parents, \u00a0i was amazed by the stories i got. Some said, as they approached their parents \u00a0when\u00a0they noticed boold stains on their pants, they were thoroughly scolded and driven away and warned never to discuss any thing on menstruation. Some said, they were forced to carry dry dust and sand to\u00a0insert into their vaginas in order to stop the bleeding as they knew not what was happening to them. Other stories came up like using \u00a0dirty clothes to pad themselves, which was very in hygienic and gave them some genital infections. \u00a0As a result of this lack of knowledge on reproductive health for adolescent girls, many have dropped out of school because of unintended pregnancies, some have contracted sexually transmissable infections and others have been forced into early marriages , to the boys that impregnated them. Many of these \u00a0adolecents have lost hope for a better future, because they are now in condtions due to necglect and lack of reproductive health knowledge. \u00a0so i am hoping to enlightened parents and the community about the importance of sex education and also advocating for this curriculum to be taught in primary and secondary schools in Cameroon. I am hoping, to equally train these adolescent girls on matters of gender equality, menstrual hygiene , family planning and reproductive health as a Whole. In Africa, there is an ardage which says \"Charity begins at home\" if \u00a0discussions between parents and children are initiated at home on sex education, it will go an extra mile to enable parents understand their daughters and support them effectively , so that they will not be statistics of unwanted pregnancies , school drop outs and poor academic performance in school. If Access to knowledge on reproductive health is improved upon \u00a0for parents and adolescent girls, then sustainable development will be ensured.

All other forms need to be done by the government to be effective. I was really surprised by this ballsy argument so I invited over for a drink on the hottest day of the year (35\u00b0C!) and we had a tomato juice and a great conversation.\n\nWe dived immediately into the subject. Care is a government issue for\u00a0 her that isn\u2019t at all taken care (pun intended) of. Why does the government give as much power to the pharmaceutical industry for example? Why can Nestl\u00e9 become the number one partner of a government organization called \u2018Kind En Gezin\u2019 that helps parents of new-born through the first year? For her our role as activist and change makers is to put pressure on the government to make change on a big scale possible.\nI explain her how local initiatives are bending the system like the open insulin, chemotherapy in Romania or ways that people are hacking neuroprosthetis. Even if she find them great initiative she is scared that it will not be scalable, for her if the government doesn\u2019t follow, nothing will change on the long term. I ask her why even within this idea people are rather trying to find solutions themselves then going in the street and pressuring the government. It makes sense, she says, you have an illusion doing something more meaningful while starting a project, then putting pressure on a government where the reward will (maybe) be given after many years. Instant gratification is much more popular, and with bureaucratic complexification people are less temped to get into a long battle with the government.\nBut Ginette isn\u2019t the person to only be sceptic and give critic towards ideas. She likes finding solutions. So before I explain her the principle of the workshop we talk a bit further on the big problems ahead. For her everything can be put into three categories: poverty, elderly care and work ethics. Poverty makes it impossible to take care of each other; it is a vicious circle that is difficult to get out of. Even with the best projects, people without money will not get towards it. Elderly care is also a big problem in European countries, care became profit and it is all about efficiency. Only a rearrangement about how we look at elderly care can get us out of this problem. Finally there is the way we look at work and how it makes us sick: burn out is one of the biggest epidemics of this century and involves pulls the whole family downwards. Not one political party is discussing these problems on a larger scale and that is problematic for her. The resources are there, but the unwillingness of changing is bigger. Politicians aren\u2019t trained to be vectors of change; they are the ones that bring continuity. It\u2019s the civilians that need to push the change and politics to implement it.\nDark times ahead? Maybe, but this discussion made me think more clearly about the workshop and what we need to take notice of when bringing care-project together. Like within the makers movement it is important to find a balance between corporate and counter culture partners, within care it is also important to have an open approach towards policy makers. Yes we are in a ruff path at the moment, and trust is at an all time low towards politicians. But therefor it is the moment to open our arms to welcome them towards new ways of organizing care. We need much more and easier collaboration between projects. We need especially that knowledge of the government to tackle complex problems with multiple partners. We need to take them by the hand and show them what there is possible within an open care system\nThe discussion I want to open towards the community is: Is involving the policy makers important, or will it be obsolete in the future?

Do they cry alone in their bedrooms? Do they logon to the internet? How do young people in grief find each other? Do they phone a friend? Do they enter a counselling centre? Do they search through hashtags and websites?\n\nDeath has never been more public than in the age of the internet. Alongside waves of #RIP[insertcelebrity] tributes and #[nameofvictim] police shooting activism proliferating on social media are viral posts of everyday people approaching grief and documenting their experience on the internet: recounting a person\u2019s final days, parting words and gratitude from the deathbed, captures of assisted suicide and \u201cright to die parties\u201d, and families commemorating the deceased.\nThese experiences of death and loss have been augmented and prolonged with the growth of social media use. More specifically, the ways in which a social media platform is structured and the dominant culture of its users has allowed people in grief to process their loss in innovative ways \u2013 new spaces of affect are created, new paralanguage vocabularies are innovated, and new transient networks of care are formulated.\nResearch has emerged in various disciplines focusing on internet memorial pages (in which the deceased and/or their funeral is commemorated on a public page), digital altars and graves (in which the living pay respects to the dead via technological mediations), afterlife digital estate management (in which the transfer and privacy of internet artifacts belonging to the deceased are negotiated), and even RIP trolling (in which trolls hijack Facebook memorial pages with abusive content). There is even an academic journal and a handful of institutes dedicated to \u201cDeath Studies\u201d.\nFor instance, monuments.com enables clients to personalize cemetery headstones with a QR code. By scanning the QR code with a smartphone, users are led to an interactive website where they may upload images and text of well wishes to the deceased and their family, or contribute to building their family heritage through stories or family trees. Users are also able to re-share their post on more mainstream social media.\nAs an anthropologist and ethnographer of digital culture, I have a comprehensive understanding of such practices. But when my younger sister passed away earlier this year, the ways in which her friends expressed and managed their grief in digital spaces led me to discover a rich repertoire of coping mechanisms, exchange of affect, and mutual aftercare in a vernacular created by young people who grew up with the internet - these really moved my heart and encouraged me to examine young people and grief in digital spaces.\nBut\u00a0just what is mutual aftercare? Often after a global grieving event such as large-scale natural disasters or spates of violence, strangers would gather in public spaces that transform into transient sites of solidarity. With candles, flowers, and written tributes in tow, strangers come together to process their grief, share their grief, and lend support to those in grief. Bodies who are not familiar with each other are motivated by the immediate, tangible, and tactile presence of other bodies in an enclosed space to disperse emotions they would usually restraint, and dispense care they would usually withhold when the group\u2019s motivations are briefly aligned. Sociologist Emile Durkheim refers to this as \u201ccollective effervescence\u201d. This is \u2018aftercare\u2019, or the care one offers to others after a hurtful experience. When people come together to publicly acknowledge their pain and simultaneously offer care and concern to fellow others in pain, this becomes a network of \u2018mutual aftercare\u2019. Young people seem to be doing similar things in digital spaces, and I wanted to find out how.\n*\nBeing a young person in my mid-twenties for whom the internet and social media is second nature, I seamlessly took to my blog to make sense of my grief and loss. I wrote about my experiences of \u201cholding space\u201d for my sister in her final days (see also Heather Plett), and about learning to declutter physical artifacts despite my abstract emotional attachment to these things. I also wrote about how I felt when Facebook friends began \u201cdeep-liking\u201d my old posts on grief and how it impeded my progress and recovery. As much as I felt hurt and disappointed by these peers, I could not justify my anger knowing that digital etiquette is not universal \u2013 knowing how to approach someone in grief on social media or how to express grief on social media is not actually \u201ccommon sense\u201d. Digital etiquette varies across personal beliefs and cultural norms, and is highly dependent on the context of interpersonal relationships and the norms of a social media platform. In other words, digital etiquette surrounding grief has to be taught, learnt, and practiced.\nI was both a young person managing grief in digital spaces and an ethnographer invested in understanding everyday practices through intimate anthropological inquiry. To do this, I conducted personal interviews with young people who self-reported using digital media (i.e. the internet, social media, devices and artifacts, non-analogue spaces) to manage their grief. I started with friends in my sister\u2019s social groups, made open calls to undergraduates in local universities, and amassed informants via snowball sampling.\nI wanted to understand what young people did on the internet to recover and how this differed from analogue coping mechanisms pre-social media. I wanted to learn how they constructed solidarity, conveyed empathy, and maintained networks of mutual aftercare. Some also showed me their smartphone apps so that I could study how they crafted content, ranging from emotive Instagram captions of meaningful photographs to extensive digital catalogues of every tactile item the deceased has ever touched.\nI learnt that a vocabulary of grief was quietly emerging among young people. For instance, emoji and emoticons were especially significant as a paralanguage. Some reported that \u201cwhen words fail\u201d, or when they \u201chad no strength\u201d to craft responses back to friends who had sent them condolences, they would mobilize emoji or emoticons to acknowledge receipt, demonstrate reciprocity, or express gratitude. One person who had lost his father to a critical illness said that while \u201cthe adults\u201d in his family did not seem to articulate their grief and loss to each other (\u201cthey strictly never said anything about it in the house\u201d), those in his generation such as his cousins took to Facebook to comfort each other via status updates and follow-up comments. Another young person began a groupchat on the messaging app WhatsApp and recruited friends of the deceased from all walks of life into the chat. They used the groupchat as a semi-private outlet to share their thoughts without having to worry about self-censorship \u2013 many of them felt Facebook was \u201ctoo public\u201d, that email was \u201ctoo impersonal\u201d, and that meeting in person was \u201ctoo soon\u201d, \u201ctoo painful\u201d, or \u201ctoo awkward\u201d. As such, the space of a groupchat accorded them the freedom to process grief more transparently among empathetic others in a safe space; the groupchat became a space of mutual aftercare.\n*\nThe need to understand young people\u2019s grief in digital spaces became clearer to me as I began consulting and conversing with healthcare professionals in palliative care. One hospice nurse expressed that as a patient approaches their end of life, most family members would single-heartedly focus all their effort and affect on that one person. Upon the death of their loved one, many people are suddenly hit with grief all at once and are unable to transit into care for each other, or \u201ccare for the living\u201d. In other words, despite social workers and counsellors preaching the value of \u201ccare chains\u201d, many people who are deep in grief simply do not have the mental capacity and physical resources to plan for self-care or mutual aftercare.\nAnother doctor reported seeing an increasing number of young patients in their late teens or early-to-mid twenties. Sorrowfully recounting a memorable incident in which her young patient instructed her to post a specifically-worded status update on his Facebook after death, she came to realize that young people deeply valued their digital estates as platforms to communicate gratitude and farewells even on their deathbed. In a handful of other instances, young patients requested for their doctors and counsellors to add them on Facebook or to read their blog in order to access sentiment they felt incapable of articulating in person, in physical spaces, via traditional media\nDespite the very crucial work that such palliative staff engage in, much of this work is negotiated ad hoc on-the-go as they \u201cplay by ear\u201d. Most staff do \u201cwhat feels right\u201d based on their individual relationships with their patients, or on their personal concepts of etiquette and ethics. In other words, once we have a better understanding of how young people grief in digital spaces, palliative healthcare workers can be equipped to guide their young patients and clients using their preferred coping mechanisms, devices, and vocabulary. To a generation for whom death and grief are increasingly public spectacles, such care will be crucial to preserving the mental well being of cohorts to come.\n*\nHave you ever commemorated the death of a loved one in digital spaces? What did you do? How did others respond to you?\nWhenever you witness someone sharing their grief on social media, how do you feel? Does it motivate you to respond to the person in particular ways?\nHow can we use social media more conscientiously so as to create spaces for mutual aftercare?\u00a0What can we do for each other in digital spaces whenever a global grieving event occurs?\nWe would love to hear from you.\n*\nThis article was written by Dr Crystal Abidin for OpenCare Research, Edgeryders.

Young adults are increasingly affected by issues like anxiety or depression. Their circumstances make them particularly susceptible to psychological stress. As many leave the familiar framework of home and school and move into an uncertain future, the newly independents have to find alternative support structures. New living situations, potentially in a new city or even country, starting university or a job, all these developments entail a multitude of mental pressures. In a time where social media is so influential, standards of self-representation are an added factor. According to one of the psychological guidance counsellors at Studentenwerk Berlin; stress, loneliness and self-image issues are very common results among many students.\nAs part of our research, we interviewed several university students from different backgrounds about negative emotions like these. One question was how they handle situations of feeling sad, stressed or lonely. The main insight was that everyone experienced this shit, but no one liked to deal with it. A prominent theme in the conversations was the difficulty to talk about emotional problems \u2013 be it a missed project deadline, a loss in the family or an eating disorder. It was mentioned\u00a0that it was easier for them to open up to someone who had similar problems and could empathize. However, it is difficult to identify the people that can offer support\u00a0when everyone tries to hide their struggles.\nAs a result, most people\u00a0don\u2019t decide to seek help until they had been in increasing pain for a prolonged amount of time. Yet at this point of outreach, recovery is still far. As we learned from our interviews, it can take months to find care that is suitable to the individual and more months to see any progress. While there is a great spectrum of available options, the general idea of psychological treatment is still stigmatized. It is often not even perceived as a possible solution. The psychologists we interviewed mentioned that many of their patients came to them only after being referred by a general practitioner or friends who had tried therapy themselves.\nYet, we cannot force people to seek help. Keeping quiet about insecurities is a justified mental defence mechanism. When we share our feelings, we are vulnerable, exposed. Oftentimes, the recipient is simply not equipped to offer a good, empathic response. This could almost be described as a societal incompetence,\u00a0stemming from a general lack of awareness.", "created_at": "2017-01-22 21:38:36", "updated_at": "2017-01-22 21:38:36", "tag_id": 1873, "post_id": 511, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 478}, {"id": 11569, "text": null, "quote": "Our challenge is to rewire neighbourhoods to take care of teenagers tending to the specific needs of their age, addressing the formation of social emotions, vocation and self knowledge.\nEurope's population decline must be addressed not only regarding maternity and natural population decrease, but also promoting the dynamic and innovative qualities the younger generations always contribute to society. Making young people relevant, inviting them to our social life, giving them a frame to belong in a European future is the necessary counterbalance for our aging and shrinking population.\nThe rate of cultural change linked to technology has been constantly increasing and initiatives to educate our people must overcome institutional slowing down, if our societies are to participate significantly in the future.\nEducation, learning & the value of teenagers\nTraditional educational systems are failing to take social changes into account. The inertia of national states behind educational institutions is failing to answer to the reality of communities that are experiencing social change at a faster than ever rate. The future we imagine cannot be reached following old pathways.\nTeenagers are left out of social life, with no appropriate spaces or other activities expected from them, apart from attending compulsory school until an age that keeps rising as the human life cycle prospers. In a phase of life characterized by passion and vocation, loads of energy and bluntness, teenagers in Europe find themselves institutionalized and irrelevant.\n\u00abFuture Tools\u00bb project is an acknowledgment of the value teenagers have for society: they hold our future in their hands. \u00abFuture Tools\u00bb is a space designed with caring attention to fit the needs of our young generation, aiming to connect them to a new world of opportunities by inviting them to work, to collaborate, to participate and to have a voice in their own community. We can now apply our knowledge about adolescence to provide a comprehensive environment in which teenagers can develop healthy social emotions, autonomous and egalitarian participation.\nProvide an alternative to corporate uses of technology through the culture of the commons; spread collaborative habits in neighborhoods; build activities rooted in intrinsic motivation that bloom in communal benefit are some of the ways \u00abFuture Tools\u00bb will engage people in fostering a society with greater equality, solidarity and sustainability.\n\u00abFuture Tools\u00bb is a common learning lab for teenagers. By offering youngster a place to gather and pursue their interests while promoting their autonomy, we aim to empower them to work for a better future. Sharing resources and interests in an alternative learning space, the culture of collaboration and the democratizing possibilities of technology, this place will have its roots in the neighborhood\u2019s daily activities and funnel the parents\u2019 interest in social promotion for their kids towards a more inclusive society.\nThe abundance of open resources that can be freely accessed through personal learning environments to learn digital skills \u2014such as computational thinking, governance software, UX design, in fact any skills that we may need to implement our projects in the world\u2014 is an opportunity, never known before to such a widespread extent, to empower our youngsters to build a better future.\nNeighboring environment\nThe neighborhood as a community comes to relevance in the task of \u00abhelping grow adults\u00bb. The age group that most closely matches the Secondary Education stage in our culture has in the neighborhood its spatial range of freedom, just one step away from the wide world they will live in as adults. Connecting these neighboring communities to the global emergence of the digital culture as makers and participants through their own teenagers is a pertinent, strengthening link between local and broader communities.\nIt is urgent for these generations of parents and offspring to leap forward over institutional stagnancy and give ourselves the shared resources we can provide for our own borough, in every neighborhood, nurturing our tribe-prone teens from the gang to the team, by building around them the common ground for community.\nIt is sometimes sad hear stating that what is being promoted for innovation in the field of education \u2014on the basis of empathic personal exchange, attention to the tempo, sensibility for intrinsic motivations, in short: the wisdom of caring for each other\u2014 are outdated methodologies. Digital tools offers a new breeze to these methodologies, an opportunity to enhance the soft aspects of learning and allow us to cast aside production-line techniques when it comes to our kids: lecturing, memorizing, exams, ringing bell schedules, curriculums and subjects.

Nowadays a lot of young people are leaving the country, respectively their parents\u2019 homes, not being married and therefore without the entire knowledge. But as said before, they are both still trying and sometimes calling their mothers to ask for help. The Korean girl once even tried to sign up for a traditional Korean cooking class to improve her skills but unfortunately it was immediately booked up. Since then she has been hoping for a new opportunity. It seems that missing the food one grew up with is a good motivation to become active. Good food triggers people to do something. It is important to put the emphasis on the word something, because both of the interviewees recognized that it is also the missing time, which keeps them from cooking all the recipes they used to love back home.

Attention will be given on how to implement the findings and skills in real life situations after the seminar.\n\nMethods such as debate, role play, body movement, individual mind management technologies, pair and group exercises and mini -coaching will be used throughout the course.\n\nThe methodology of the course includes learner \u2013 centered approach and utilizes self-learning methods.\n\nThe aim of the course is not to produce ready-made solutions (passive learning), but to inspire the participants to search creatively for knowledge and effective solutions which are connected with their needs and challenges (active learning). In this way the participants take responsibility for their own learning process and act as active partners of the course.\n\nAfter\n\nThe participants will be encouraged to form a network in order to continue an exchange of ideas and support one another. Up to 6 months after completion of the workshop, the participants will have an opportunity to ask for advice (via email or Skype) if they face obstacles in using the new skills or if they have any questions or concerns.", "created_at": "2017-11-30 01:27:05.035650", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:31:49.927736", "tag_id": 1632, "post_id": 6293, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 6260}, {"id": 11580, "text": null, "quote": "In relation to what i bring on to the open village festival, i intend to lay out the underlying reasons why we have a lot of youths engaged in drug abuse in africa and its social-economical effects of developing-world countries.\ni would to demonistrate the importance strong communities towards combating the drug menace and eventually creating awereness with views eradication of the drug menace.\nradicalisation is spreading fast among drug users who are easy targets for terrorist activities in the coastal city of Mombasa.if we are at aposition of curbing the issue at hand, then we will be able to address the global effects of terrorism.which not only affects us in Kenya but now a major issue in Europe, middle east and the USA.\nwe hope to grow a strong network out of the presentation at the festival so as to broaden our scope of understanding and welcome some experts in social-counseling who may helps in rehabilitating these youth into leading productive lives within the communiting.\napproach of presentation\n\nthe presentation may include brief videos and statistical data to show the scale of damage.\ngroup discussions and presentation(which may require representatives of each team presenting their finding to attendees)\nslides hence i may require :\n\n\nprojector\nwhite board\nmakers\n\nNOTE : the presentation may take 30-45 minutes\nat the festival i hope to learn more on collaboration and experiences in europe which may help us advance our urge to transform our local communities to provition of global solution to our local challenges.", "created_at": "2017-06-27 13:29:32", "updated_at": "2017-06-27 13:29:32", "tag_id": 1873, "post_id": 6407, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 6374}, {"id": 11581, "text": null, "quote": "Csengele: heard about OpenVillage from the Internet, isnt sure.

The air polluting our lungs, our breast milk filled with toxins, and our mental angst driving us to suicide. Proposed health cuts increase our general precarity in relation to a failing health system, a health system that fundamentally furthers our objectification and dependency on capital. Therefore the steps we make to gain and share skills and develop subterranean practices of care can return some of the agency we\u2019ve lost to the professionalization of medicine and the profitable mystery that is our bodies. As we think about expanding our capacity, we don\u2019t want to just \u201cfill in the gaps\u201d of public health infrastructure. We need to slowly break our dependence on these institutions in all the ways that we can and also look for ways to use them to our advantage. We think this happens through sharing knowledge and skills, an emphasis on preventative care, and finding ways to manipulate existing structures to allow us to move forward on this path of autonomy. We believe in the utter necessity of revolution, of the development of material lines of power. Questions of care and health autonomy are pivotal to that progression. From the Greek solidarity clinics to the Zapatistas \u201chealthcare from below\u201d to Black Panther Clinics and GynPunks, there is inspiration for this path all around us.

I mostly remember him for knowing probably all brand new, absurd Twitter accounts, and being able to quote quite a lot of their content.\nThen I have learned a bit more - and the more unveiled, the more impressive it got. There is a great reason for us to team up and work on the challenge together: Hacking, internet security, and medical devices. He knows a lot about that stuff.\n\u00c9ireann with his friend, Dr. Marie Moe started investigating the security of pacemakers - as Marie's life actually depends on a little instrument that generates each of her heartbeats. And runs\u00a0on a proprietary code. This means she has to implicitly trust the programmers, and despite her and Eireann\u2019s years of assessing devices for security holes, they wouldn\u2019t normally be \u201callowed\u201d to investigate the security of such devices.\nThis implies how little a regular customer of similar devices is informed about the ways they work, what protocols and tools they use, where their data is stored, etc. It has everything to do with person's safety - and still, companies keep most of the key information secret from the users, making them more vulnerable.\nI suggest you watch this great video from 32C3, where Marie and \u00c9ireann tell about their journey.\nObviously, the issue of safety transcends this case and applies to a whole range of tools that increasingly improve our quality of life and longevity. The security flaws are potentially causing exactly the opposite, making for a health/life hazard. There are concerns about privacy too, where your medical data flows around the world to companies that may or may not be taking measures to protect it.\nBut that's not all - \u00c9ireann works also as an advisor for European Network for Cyber Security (ENISA), has founded http://www.concinnity-risks.com/, and works as a Senior Risk Researcher at Cambridge Centre for Risk Studies. He is loosely affiliated with I Am The Cavalry, a cyber security movement, whose motto is \u201cSafer. Sooner. Together.\u201d\nHe contributes to our OPENandChange application vast expertise in the security of medical devices, and embedded devices. He will be helping DIY makers, programmers, and engineers with training on how to build safer code, and what standards they will want to comply with to produce products for different markets. He's also offering insight into vulnerability research and standards-based research, contributing safety and transparency knowledge to this huge, open swarm OPENandChange wants to become. Lastly, he loves the idea of preparing a consumer training and equipping people who rely on medical devices with knowledge and clear questions they can ask about their own devices.\nFinally, \u00c9ireann has just been announced an Open Web Fellow for Privacy International and he will be taking the word out about our idea while advocating for open cyberspace.", "created_at": "2017-01-27 19:10:18", "updated_at": "2017-01-27 19:10:18", "tag_id": 459, "post_id": 712, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 679}, {"id": 18960, "text": "", "quote": "n January I quit my job, so I was already without a job before Corona.

A country like Bangladesh, which is constantly facing threats of so many kinds of natural disaster, is being increasingly ignorant about its natural conservation. This country has only 17% of forests within. This by the way is getting narrower. Even the largest mangrove forest Sundarbans, which is an internationally recognized world heritage site, is also facing terrible manmade disasters and constant environmental pollutions. It has reached such a zenith, that the global-ecosystem is threatened with the loss of a majority of all species, by the end of this century. Everyone knows, but some chose to ignore it, some choose to remain silent about it. But I thought the simplest solution to address this problem is just plant more trees. It\u2019s a simple yet most productive solution to involve the youth, who first of all should be concerned about it; secondly should take initiatives to mitigate this problem. The idea to run an online campaign came to me due to the massive participation of youth in social media. My goals were very simple, engaging the youth to talk about the problem or at least make them realize how important it is to address the issue. Secondly, mobilize my community to take an initiative in real space so that they feel the necessity to do something about this particular problem.\nAlong with few friends, I started inviting people over facebook to join the event. All they had to do is plant 5 trees and nominate 5 other friends on facebook to replicate the same. This way it will work like a chain reaction and we will be able to see a huge number of trees getting planted in a short period of time. The campaign is still going on and more people are joining. I know it has not gone viral and the number is not that high. Because in reality if you want to mobilize your community for a good cause, you have to ensure some motivations for them. Social norms are something that people tend to follow. Online campaign is there to help create a buzz, to create an objective. Which means if someone can bring out the movement from online space to offline, it moves faster and better. This is exactly why I have planned to run this campaign both online and offline.\nPrimarily I even offered few things extra to carry on with the campaign. Since I am an online based entrepreneur and I have a client tale which is 3 years old, we kind of have a personal trust relationship with each \u00a0other. So I personally offered my clients, I'll plant trees on behalf of them for every sell worth $10.\nTo bring the campaign to reality, a part of that plan involves talking to the civil society and involving them. Therefore, we are in touch with mayor\u2019s office to propose an idea to tell the citizens, if they plants 5 trees, they'll get a discount on their TAX. The CEO\u2019s of top notch companies to take part in this initiative where we want them to initiate a tree plantation program as a part of their CSR activities. Encourage their employees to plant trees so that they can get a better record at the end of the year in the ACR. We've asked the Headmasters of local schools to run the campaign along with the students, whoever plants more trees and takes care of them properly, will get an excellence award & certificate from the school. Recently our PM received the award of CHAMPION of the Earth for her outstanding initiative on\u00a0increasing forests and going green. I am simply trying to follow her path to make a change. Because I believe, OXYGEN is the most needed thing on earth and one can not simply buy a healthy environment with money. It takes proper plan and interest to create a land full of trees and a lot of patient.

So what I'd think is crucial is the presentation format and delivery method.\n\nFor example after a catastrophy (or on the march) very few people will have the time to read about it in Red Cross or USAid pdfs even though they would probably remember critical things much better than in a classroom. Some can understand scientific papers, and others cannot read. Generally, if you want to be prepared you need to invest some time into practicing or reading e.g. \"Where there is no Doctor\", or stocking some tools or supplies before shit hits the fan. Not many people are ready to do that. It is much less glamorous than posing with big guns and other stuff. Often people (correctly) feel it is unlikely that they would get a return on investment for their effort. Also, crises affect different regions (e.g. climate) in different ways, in those regions e.g. urban areas will be affected differently from rural, in those places different people (age, occupation, gender, minority) will again be affected differently in short to long term.\n\nMost documents I know are written in a linear fashion, either for \"the general populace\" or authorities, or a few select critcal professions. Research articles in the field are often a bit better (if you can get them and understand them) as they show more of the detail under the hood. There is quite a bit out there in English, German, and I am sure French language. I would expect that other languages can be a very mixed bag.\n\nInterestingly almost none of the materials I know are intended for reproduction and dissemination (perhaps modification) in the field, which I think is a critical shortcoming. Economically you often cannot but be largely unprepared for low frequency large impact events. If you could could start quickly copy-pasting stuff from a relatively few seeds once the event has come to pass, you would very quickly be able to deliver information and organize action far better.\n\nI think the most realistic forms of reproduction in the field are (including grid down, excluding perhaps nuclear EMP scenarios):\n\n\nCopies via smart phone, either onto micro-sd card or using e.g. bluetooth file transfer.\nRecording of spoken/played material via phone, perhaps eventually put into writing.\nPencil/coal stick/copy machine copies of simple illustrations/heuristics/nmemonics/ not more than a few lines in most cases.\n\n\nMy suggestion would be a less linear and mostly digital collection of material (even if the grid will be down it will be relatively easy to charge a smartphone/tablet/etc from solar or car batteries). Ideally most of it can be accessed through different lenses - weighing urgent vs important, for the specific \"type\" of audience, in a (or several) appropriate formats. On the latter point I would strongly recommend inlcuding something that is audio based with separate illustrations (and check lists, e.g. in playing card deck, or digitally as \"album art\" format) and incremental navigation (e.g. if you need to know more on this topic press forward 9 times and you hear the announcement \"xyz\"). An audio lecture then could be made up of a summary of 1. the most important things to know in a hurry, 2. the main content, 3. mnemonic take aways to repeat to yourself.\n\nAudio has the advantages that you do not need to drop everything you're doing, you can do it while walking, and you can do it in the dark.\n\nIf you use 64kbps (clear spoken language) mono mp3 audio you need approximately 1 MB for every 2 minutes. If we assume 24h of spoken material that would be 720 MB. This fits into almost every memory card (or CD), mp3 player and can be copied using bluetooth version 3 in 5 minutes, and version 2 in 30 minutes. The most important things everyone needs to know should probably be available in different languages but be only 3-15 minutes in duration. Additional material can be provided in ebook format (which can be referenced in the audio) with very little space required.\n\nMy schematic in the other comment is an example for non-digital content that can also be reproduced in the field, when you actually have demand. It could also be airdropped as leaflets of course.\n\nI wanted to make a heuristic approach to re-establish some skeletal form of organization which can catalyze coopreration (especially in the 48h hours of pro-social behavior mostly observed after an acute catastrophe). I thought this is necessary because very often there exists no effective interface to the local society that the \"professional care & aid circus\" can dock into, and many of the respective group's fuck-ups would be easier to avoid if there was such an interface. The idea is to establish channels on the ground within the local community which accumulate, curate (discuss), and disseminate critical information. Those information dense hubs can relatively easily be found and interfaced with the professionals. If the crises do not have a clear onset like an earthquale or flood, but is more creeping other approaches may be more effective though.\n\nThe implied understanding that may motivate people is the following: Doing difficult situations alone is usually not a good idea*. Put 20% into helping each other, and if the majority survives you'll probably be among them.\n\nThe simplified instructions: 1 of 5 connects and helps to coordinate. 1 in 5 helps to coordinate coordinators. Information must flow in both directions fast, and critical aspects need to be documented.\n\nMake a group in which you will quickly be able to trust, care, and communicate (so about 5). Then make groups of groups and dedicate 10-20% of your resources to communication & cooperation, about half \"upwards\" and half \"downwards\".\n\n*Something that rarely gets enough attention when you superficially glance at the prepper scene.

During my study, I focused on security and privacy. That work led me to meet people like Andreas Pfitzmann, a cryptographer who had moved into the field of privacy enhancing technology. They were coming up with new theories of security. For example, they argued that the objective of a computer scientist is not to secure the system, but to build systems that secure the interests of the different actors who are using and are affected by that system. And that really appealed to me.I became interested in the question related to the different factors of stakeholders to a system and how they have different security interests. That\u2019s what we should be enabling and not protecting systems for their own sake. That\u2019s how I got into privacy technologies. This was also politically very interesting. A lot of security comes from the military domain. Businesses employ security as a way to secure the assets of the company. So, by realizing we should be securing different stakeholders, we were able to start acting on security and privacy in a very different way.Privacy was often in juxtaposition to security: it was about protecting the users from the service providers themselves. You would see the user needs instead of \u201cassets\u201d as the driving force of your designs. That is how I got to the general question in my research: is there another computer science possible?

In one project taking place at the lab, members are engineering yeast to express milk proteins from non-animal sources - next generation of vegan cheeses and milk. Others are busy developing an eco-friendly bacterial sunscreen.\nOpen Insulin is one of these projects, and its goal is to make it simpler and less expensive to make insulin, starting by investigating some novel ideas for making insulin in e. coli using fewer, easier steps than in common industrial protocols. If successful, the members hope it can be a step towards making generic production more economical, and might also enable more participation in research related to insulin, or production of the medicine at smaller scale, closer to the patients who need it, further reducing costs and giving access to more patients who lack it.\nCounter Culture Labs was founded by a group of hackers with diverse backgrounds and interests in the period from 2011 to 2012, with some members coming from Sudo Room, another hackerspace in Oakland that I participated in founding. Many were also involved in Occupy Oakland, and wanted to establish a more permanent organization with the same community spirit and values. Other members came from Biocurious, another biohacking space in Sunnyvale, in the southern end of the Bay Area. I became involved both because I shared the desire to build a community-focused institution, and because I have diabetes type 1 myself, which means I live with the frustration of costly and tedious treatment regimens day in and day out, and I know how much the standard of care for diabetes patients lags behind what recent research suggests might be possible. So, for my own sake, and for the sake of the others with the condition, I sought to take whatever steps I could to close the gap between the research and what is available to patients on the market right now.\nAbout a year ago, some long-standing discussions around making a bioreactor to produce insulin, which had inspired a few previous attempts, turned more concrete when Isaac Yonemoto, another independent researcher of medical treatments, made some suggestions to us about interesting possibilities for innovation and improvement in existing protocols. We started organising regular meetings, and out of those we then organized a successful crowdfunding campaign, which then opened up connections to professionals who work on various aspects of the problem, both the science and engineering around insulin, and the questions of access to medicine. Through this it came to our attention that access to insulin lags far behind the need even now, and even in the most developed countries - costs of insulin are prohibitive even to many people in the US - and all in all, roughly 50% of those in the world who require it have no access to insulin at all, according to the 100 Campaign, a group working on improving access to insulin around the world. There is almost no generic insulin on the American market at the moment - the first one appeared on the market about two weeks after we finished our crowdfunding campaign last year, but it is a long acting type, which is only part of the therapy required by people with diabetes type 1 (about 15-20% of diabetics in USA have type 1; the rest have type 2). And for those who use an insulin pump, short acting insulin is necessary.\nThe general problem in the first world is that the incentives and interests of producers and patient communities are not aligned.\nRight now we\u2019re focused on achieving the first scientific milestones, which is to produce proinsulin, the precursor of the active form of insulin, in e. coli, in our small-scale community lab. Our lab runs mostly on donated and salvaged equipment and reagents and might be comparable in its capabilities to a lab in a less-developed area of the world where there is the least access to insulin. If we succeed, it would show the possibility that small-scale producers in remote areas might be able to make insulin to satisfy local demand, in places where centrally-manufactured supplies can\u2019t reach due to lack of infrastructure - where what roads there are, if any, do not let refrigerated trucks pass to ship needed pharmaceuticals in. Once we have a protocol that embraces everything from production to purification to near the level of purity of pharmaceutical grade insulin, we plan to approach established generics manufacturers with a case for the economic feasibility of serving the unserved market for insulin, and to partner with them to do the rest of the work of achieving sufficient purity of the product and scaling the methods to production. As we proceed with our work, the main batch of patents around the various forms of insulin are expiring, which will further help us make the case for a comprehensive portfolio of treatments to potential generics manufacturers.\nProvided all this goes well, we might then pursue another idea, closer to our original hope of a bioreactor that produces insulin, and a kind of \u2018holy grail\u2019 goal in the DIY bio world, which is a desktop biofactory, an analog of desktop 3D printers, but for proteins and biologics, which we might develop to first execute one of our protocols to produce insulin, but which we might also design with more flexibility in mind. This would consist of a bioreactor portion that could grow a culture of e. coli or yeast, and then extract and purify a product from it - very roughly speaking, the union of a fermenter with an FPLC, a piece of equipment that purifies proteins. If that is possible, supply of insulin could be placed very close to the demand of the diabetics around the world in a simple, economical package, and reliance on distribution infrastructure would be minimized. It would also reduce the need to have skilled technicians with years of lab experience to execute these protocols by hand.\nUltimately, I hope that opening up the tools for research to more people can help to bring research on cures to patients, and not just treatments. Let me mention a few of the more promising ideas that have had some success in research settings. One approach is to implant functioning pancreatic cells from a donor and protect them from immune attack by various means - hard to scale if you need a constant supply of donors,but it might be possible to grow cultures of the cells in vitro to address this. Another approach is to get the immune system to cease its attack on pancreatic cells, and promote the regrowth of the body\u2019s own insulin-producing cells, either in the pancreas, or in another tissue via gene therapy - a simpler approach to apply once it is developed. Some of the ideas use very inexpensive supplies such as adjuvants, the materials in vaccines that provoke an immune response - and there has been some success using adjuvants alone, or with carefully chosen additions, to get the bodies of diabetic patients to reduce or cease their autoimmune attacks. Other concepts address the metabolic changes behind type 2 diabetes. Several drugs between the research and commercial worlds of medicine can act directly on the metabolic control mechanisms of the body, changing its pattern of energy use and other aspects of metabolism back from the pathological state of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes to the normal, healthy base state. Some of them are small organic molecules, easier to make than proteins such as insulin, but due in part to reasons of cost and incumbency, are not mainstream treatments yet.\nAt the most general level, what we seek to prove is that if an order of magnitude more people get involved in research and development of science and technology, medicine can progress much faster, and might no longer be held back by institutional constraints and perverse incentives in the economics of the institutions. Right now, we\u2019re a group about half a dozen people working regularly on the project, with a few dozen more people in touch every now and then to help out, and a hundred or two in the extended community, ready to answer a question or call for help. Every week or two, someone new comes to the group, who just learned about the project via the media or our regular meetups, and wants to help. Some are complete beginners and end up taking our introductory classes to biohacking, some already have experience but got tired of the limits of the institutions where they worked, or have relatives with diabetes and want to contribute to progress. Though we\u2019re building up a broader community of participation in research slowly, we hope our efforts can plant many seeds out of which future innovations will grow.\nMeanwhile, we are looking to broaden a circle of people who can advise us, experienced scientists and engineers who can help us troubleshoot issues that inevitably come up when investigating the unknown, but we also hope to inspire other groups to work independently in a broader community of innovation. We would like to set up a network of both institutional and DIY researchers living all around the world who have different approaches and ways of making insulin as well as tackling other diabetes and health related issues. Beyond producing drugs, participants might research questions of access to medicine, investigate what patient communities need the most, look at academic publications to identify the most promising research that is not making it out to serve patients, or help establish the effort to build the desktop biofactory. Part of our goal is to prove it\u2019s possible and worthwhile for people outside institutions to take the initiative on these questions, and inspire others to take the lead in their own efforts and bring about the broader changes we seek.\nDo you have any projects in health, medicine, or biohacking that you\u2019d like to work on, but lack people, knowledge, or resources to make it happen? Are you working on a diabetes-related solution? Or do you feel like a network of care biohackers is something you\u2019d like to get involved with?
