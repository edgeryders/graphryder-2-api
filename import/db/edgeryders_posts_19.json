Main promises</h3>\n\n* **T1.3.**\n\n    * EDGE contribution to Topic do-occurence analysis (Task led by DElab): *the analysis reveals which technologies and social issues are frequently mentioned together in selected texts, such as published articles or working papers. We will analyse and map these co-occurrences in a set of visualisations, in order to evaluate which technologies and social issues to focus on most, which will also aid in the selection of new EC work programme topics. DELab will lead this task and will be responsible for analysis. **EDGE will provide additional data, generated by the NGI Forward online conversation and its ethnographic coding**.*\n\n* **T2.1.**\n\n    * we set up **central forum** for general debate on the future of the internet, and **four sub-forums** aimed at and tailored to the needs of specific stakeholder communities.\n    * we engage communities across **four major European languages**: English, the main language of the platform, French, German, Italian, French and Polish.\n    * we train **12** community managers who between them can manage the different communities and languages.\n\n* **T2.2.**\n\n    * Stakeholder identification: beyond the usual suspects. (Task led by Aarhus). \n\n* **T2.3.**\n\n   * We design, organise and run **12** onboarding events across Europe, aimed at collecting perspectives on NGI and bringing a broader stakeholder base into the project.\n    * We are aiming to have an online exchange platform of approximately **500-1000** active participant-informants by the end of the project.\n\n* **T2.4.**\n\n    * SSNA: *we maintain a consistent multi-language coding ontology across the project, with as our aim ensuring each code in each language has exactly one equivalent in each of the other languages.*\n\n* **T2.5.**\n\n   * Data Management and technical support\n\n* **T2.6.**\n\n    * Knowledge transfer onto NGI exchange platform: *From events, we engage proven offline-online documentation methods to create short video testimonials and main points of contention surfaced during panel discussions.*\n\n* **T3.6.**\n\n   * Developing a shared vision for the NGI (Task led by NESTA): contribute to the report.\n\n* **T4.2.**\n\n   * The Impact Summit (Task led by Edgeryders, with additional support from Aarhus University, Nesta and Resonance Design.): *We convene a final Impact Summit in M34 of the project targeting the cross section of the project\u2019s communities including researchers, innovators, activists, public administrators and policy makers, industry journalists and community leaders. Ambassadors from WP2, and selected NGI influencers will be engaged to curate a dynamic program, incorporating key points of debate and insights into participatory activities that produce co-designed tools and pathways forward. Goal: **1 three day conference with 300-350 active attendees and report**.*\n\n* **T5.2.**\n\n  * Community journalism program. *This consists in engaging respected and accessible voices with a good social media presence and commissioning them high-quality posts on their perspectives around a human-centric next generation internet. This creates \u201cseed\u201d content that can be re-shared on social media in T2.2 to aggregate debate, attract new users and new contributions. We aim to commission **60 such pieces** over eighteen months of the project.*\n\n* **T5.3.**\n\n     * EDGE contribution to the NGI Visions Book (Task led by NESTA): *We commission between **ten and fifteen written contributions** from high-profile thinkers in the internet space, as well as ten more creative outputs by artists (illustrations, photography, interactive data visualisation, videos on relevant youtube channels, short stories, comics). These contributions will be turned into a dynamic, well-designed website and a hard-copy book. Though we plan to release the visions book mid-way through the project (M20), we will separately release content on a more trickled-through schedule, ensuring we have a constant stream of interesting content to engage our audience.* Note that related deliverable (D5.6.) for this task originally due in Month 20 (August 2020) is postponed for the last year of the project. More info expected from the coordinator.\n\n* **T6.3.**\n\n     - EDGE contributes to: *develop a detailed data management plan and knowledge management plan to have as reference and living documents throughout the project. The data management plan will explain in detail which research and personal data will be gathered in the project and how this data will be managed. The DMP will take into account the ethical management strategy concerning processing of personal and sensitive data outlined in Section 5.* Contribution to the deliverable 6.5 submitted in July 2019.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--3\">3. Process for modifications</h2>\n\nFinally, please remember that deviations to this are possible but only if we have solid justifications and we provide them in the reports. If there are major changes that also affect the budget please inform me so that I can communicate this to the coordinators and verify if the GA amendment is necessary. \n\nFor your reference, full GAs can be found here: for [POPREBEL](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1U-8RHhn3-ythtLyQSOw3oRm_A8E2pyfg) / for [NGI Forward](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1d_vkJiVoG88s1H6Hskz40-YS4t3eA02l). Also, the magic budgets for both projects have been updated according to the actual expenses in the last year, up to March 2020.

However, that also removed the topics in these categories from the \"Latest\" lists of all the tags, interfering with the intended webkit functions as you observed.\n\nSo I have defined a different way to mute notifications about webkit topics, and [documented it](/t/-/13594#heading--1-4). For you this simply means right now to not create any new categories for webkit content. Instead, everything should go into the \"[Edgeryders \"Summary\" Websites](/c/edgeryders-summarywebsites/352)\" category (which we'll have to rename at some point). For me it means to mute the webkit categories on a per-user basis for any new users when they are created, which is an issue I'll handle every week manually with a batch operation in the Discourse admin backend, and in the future with a Discourse plugin, which [still has to be developed](https://github.com/edgeryders/discourse/issues/249).\n\nI have moved the three affected pieces of content back into the \"Remote Work\" category now ([see](/tag/webcontent-remote-work-services-french)), and with the new setup the [corresponding website](https://live.edgeryders.eu/14726) continues to work.

But remember this is devil-in-the-details territory. A friend was complaining to me that many applied research environments (OECD, for example, but the JRC as well) are insisting on topic models, which in her opinion are not open enough to novelty and serendipity.

They are deploying pretty cutting edge stuff, from neighborhood-shared long term care for elderly people to social innovation incubators in the dodgiest areas of the city. They are very interested in playing ball. They will try to come onboard as a full partner, but they may not have the time for this (they need a formally approved political decision, as per their internal processes). If it turns out they don't, they will write us a very specific letter of endorsement and pre-agree some activities that will be carried out by WeMake. The letter of endorsement will refer to such activities. So, the city will act like an \"internal client\" to the project.\n\nThis is great, because all of this social innovation activities around welfare is dictated exactly by the situation we describe in the proposal: dwindling public sector resources and erosion of the capital of social cohesion.

We will help authors with similar interests and complementary expertise find each other, and assist with the search for a publisher.\n\nWe invite contributions from a wide range of disciplines including \u2013 but not limited to \u2013 economics, social science, philosophy, history, design. We encourage Interdisciplinary contributions, and **especially welcome applications from science fiction authors and readers**. No credential is required apart from a keen interest in the issue at hand.

For example, in _Walkaway_ Cory Doctorow shows us some small-scale economies based on public- and common goods, and peer production. How is that economy micro-founded? How are incentives tuned?

The ruling party has overwhelming power and control over the country, which they exercise on every level. Also the opposition is divided into fake opposition (those set up by the ruling party to divide the opposition voters), crooked opposition (people with already bad reputation and with good reason), and opposition focusing often on what the ruling party is doing bad, as opposed to focusing on their own program/road to success. There are exceptions but they don't have much traction and they have to fight against the media and all the votes the ruling party gets by default, thanks to the corrupt structure they created. A lot of people \"owe it\" to the ruling party, be it just a small job in some village or a big company in Belgrade...\n\nRegarding the security, I agree very much with Alberto and the \"blunders in the whole COVID mess\". This COVID situation has revealed some very worrying things as far as I am concerned but there are also positives.\nPositives would be: \n1. The way whole communities came together in various initiatives created for common good.\n2. Seeing so many academics and intelligentsia all over the world rising up to the challenge and going against the grain/current main narrative regarding COVID.\nThere still isn't enough impact as we are witnessing incredible censorship across all media and major platforms but the facts will come out eventually.\nThe sheer number of those people, in spite suffering huge pressure from various power structures, tells me something very worrying is happening. If it wasn't, they wouldn't be reacting so strongly.\n\nThere are many things which make me feel less secure in recent times, it will be a very long post if I go into all of them so I will just name a big one:\n**The way majority of people turned into sheep as soon as they felt threatened.** We abandoned the most fundamental human rights so easily, even giving up bodily integrity and right to free movement. I realised very fast the real threat doesn't come from the corrupt \"system\". It comes from the people surrounding us, the mindless general population. Here is a little passage about Goebbels ways from the introduction of the 1978 book \u201cFinal Entries, 1945: The Diaries of Joseph Goebbels: \u201cThere was no point in seeking to convert the intellectuals. For intellectuals would never be converted and would anyway always yield to the stronger, and this will always be \u201cthe man in the street.\u201d Arguments must therefore be crude, clear and forcible, and appeal to emotions and instincts, not the intellect. Truth was unimportant and entirely subordinate to tactics and psychology.\u201d \nI don't know about you but to me this is freakishly familiar to strategy used today.\n\nAll that is the result of long term institutionalized obedience and weakened individual. Does it lead to increased dependence of the state? \n\nHuman freedom used to mean freedom from the king, then from the state, today it means protection by the state. They are using fear and manipulation of fear to reduce personal freedom as a necessity of increased security.\n\nThe scariest part for me is seeing people I consider intelligent and educated go into the sheep/robot mode, call it what you will. That just shows the effectiveness of the machine.\n\nOverall I believe the responses/anti COVID measures put in place are disproportionate and in general a result of very bad judgement. I believe they will kill more than COVID. I believe they will cause a lot more long term damage, both mental and physical, on a very large amount of people.\nI know nobody will answer for what is being done right now but, I also believe people should bear consequences for their actions and I know whey will...one way or the other.\n\nCoronary viruses are particles between 0.06 micron and 0.14 micron in diameter, averaging about 0.125 micron. Still think the pieces of cloth/plastic people put on their mouth protect anyone?\nObviously masks are effective and have been used by professionals for a long time. What you see people wearing around you has nothing to do with a proper mask.\nI believe also the authorities would be more clear about the difference between a mask and face covering. Mask would protect us more but making us all cover our faces increases social distance and is a great exercise in social obedience...\n\nAre people wondering about very experienced, capable people who achieved a lot in their respective fields of virology, microbiology etc suddenly being called charlatans, weirdos and nutcases because they told us a different story about COVID or the measures taken against it? \n\nWhy do professionals from various medical fields in Germany have to organise by themselves a [conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X21UboS93qc&ab_channel=GlobalMedia), sponsor it themselves and post it themselves on youtube as not a single media would cover them anyway? It's a wonder youtube didn't censor them as well...they censored since all this started.\n\nWhat about the CDC numbers released recently, about mortality rates? Turns our we are looking at a flue variation? The average age of deceased is 78 years?  What about the fact that only a fraction of deaths could be really attributed to COVID? Great majority have covid as one of the reasons for death but, considering the current agenda, it is often just added to the regular cause of death. Over 90% had more than 1 cause of death.  \n\nEveryone talks about false negatives but how many false positives are there? I have a minor cold right now, I bet I would be positive if I did 3 tests over the next 3 days.\nI know people who tested positive after spending 2 weeks with their whole family in the same villa. Only one person tests positive and 9 others have nothing? Well is this virus highly infectious or are our PCR tests not reliable? Same with people who tested positive but had no anti bodies later, false positives?\nThere are so many questions raised, so much simply stinks in this whole story and I really hope we will get to the bottom of it soon.", "created_at": "2020-10-09 01:03:41.566279", "updated_at": "2020-10-09 01:03:41.566279", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1048, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 63.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [83843], "is_liked_by": [8, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14059, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 743, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Same as Noemi</b>\n\nHello @wave , I also was intrigued by this idea, but I don't get it.

More than ever, MENA youth suffer from social and economic exclusion.\n\nToday, the energy of the youth needs to be channeled into behavioral, social, and economic change for the common good.\n\nThis is why it's essential to actively engage and commit youth to a useful purpose to bring hope, stability, and sustainable growth in MENA.\n\n**Why a mentoring program?**\n\nDu to the high rate of unemployment in the MENA, region entrepreneurship has been presented as the first alternative to make a living for these young people.\n\nGovernments, funders, and many NGO's offer incubation and acceleration programs for young social entrepreneurs. These programs have, without a doubt, a real impact on reducing the unemployment rate. But none of them have created a real supportive ecosystem for the entrepreneurs, according to the social entrepreneurs interviewed by our team in November 2018.\n\nHence was born the idea to offer a human-centric incubation program in which we support social entrepreneurs to make sure first of all that the entrepreneurship adventure is aligned with their professional and personal perspectives. And then evaluate the feasibility of their social business idea and if it solves a real issue for the community.\n\nDuring the first two months, the 12 participants / Project leaders will attend individual and collective online labs\n\nThe labs last between 60 and 90 minutes and will be conducted by mentors or and OCI Lab team members.\n\nEach online lab has a specific topic to support the young entrepreneur from concept to adoption.\n\n***1.1 Lab 1: Identify the business /Social Problem***\n\nDate: 07/12/2019\n\n***1.2 Lab 2: Define your solution and your project value proposition***\n\nDate: 13/12/2019\n\n\n\n***1.3 Lab 3: Set up your action plan and draft your Lean Business Model Canvas***\n\nDate: 18/12/2019\n\nLab materials: Action plan template, LBMC template\n\n***1.4 Lab 5: Matching Lab ( contributors and Project Leaders)***\n\nDate: 21/12/2019\nThe process involves 2 main actors\n\n* Project Leader\n\n* Contributors\n\nEvery project leader will be introduced to selected contributors so they can deliver the MVP on the expected deadline according to the action plan set by the end of Lab 3.\n\n***1.5 Lab 5: Validate your POC***\n\nDate: 10/01/2020\n\n***1.6 Lab 6: Customer Validation***\n\nDate 16/01/2020\n\n***1.7 Lab 7: Financial Model Validation***\n\nDate: 25/01/2020\n\nLab materials: Financial model template\n\n***1.8 Lab 8: Prepare your pitch deck***\n\nDate: 01/02/2020\n\nMentors do not need to be qualified trainers or experts. They need to be able to listen and ask questions that will challenge the mentee to help them develop their project idea and their skills.\n\nMentors will also prepare their mentees to manage their adventure better by :\n\n* Connect them with the right people who may help them\n* Share with them the opportunity to develop new networks of contacts\n* Recommend an internship or training to acquire new skills\n* Help them refine their strategy according to the market trends to get access to funding opportunities\n\nWant to take part in this new project as a mentor?

He narrates documentaries and has acted in dozens of films, including \"E.T.\"  He was a key figure in the counterculture in the 60s - when I came of age - and is, in my view, among the most clear-eyed and articulate voices in describing those times, why they matter, and how they are relevant today.\n\nHe lived on communes that were much more free form than The Farm where I resided. And as a personal aside, he started a commune way up in the north mountain woods of California called Black Bear.  Later, long after he moved away (though still keeping a strong connection), my son Al lived there for a few months and while there met and developed a relationship with another young woman living there.  She is now the mother of two of my grandchildren.\n\nPeter was also a friend of Stewart Brand, who convinced him he needed to get online.  as the Well support person in the mid 80s, I had the pleasure of teaching Peter how to use email -- something I also did for Dr. Timothy Leary.\n\nHere are two good quotes from this article with a local TV station that is currently airing a ten-part documentary about the Vietnam War (that is absolutely riveting, and for people my age a real catharsis.\n[Link to the article](https://ww2.kqed.org/arts/2017/09/20/the-summer-of-crap-peter-coyote-on-vietnam-and-life-in-the-60s/).\n\n[Link to the Vietnam Documentary](http://www.pbs.org/show/vietnam-war/).\n\n\"Coyote and six others splintered off and formed the Diggers, an anarchist collective determined to incite change through theater. But instead of staging plays, the Diggers hosted events with subliminal messages. For example, they gave away free food, but in order to be fed, one had to walk through a large yellow square called 'Free Frame of Reference.'\n\n'It was like a ceremony. You stepped through it and imagined yourself in a world with free food,' Coyote said.\n\nThe point of the Free Frame of Reference and later, the Free Store, was to show others what the world could be like if everything was free. Such experiments saw the Diggers not only rebelling against capitalism, but the political tactics of the established left wing.\n\n'We challenged ourselves and others to imagine a world that we\u2019d like to live in, and then make it real,' Coyote said. \u201cWe felt that if people had a life that they liked, they might be willing to defend it. They were not going to throw themselves on the barricades because they read Mao\u2019s little red book.'\n\nThe Diggers evolved into the Free Family, which established a series of communes that reached from Northern California to the Pacific Northwest, and throughout the Southwest. Coyote says he loved those days, even though they subsisted on little \u2014 he averaged about $2,500 a year, and much of the commune\u2019s funds came from welfare. But everyone seemed to do their part in terms of chores and other responsibilities, the entertainment came from board games and being with each other, and the group learned it didn\u2019t need much to be happy. For Coyote, it was 'a wonderful life.'\n\n'It was the perfect confluence of living the life your art described,' Coyote said. 'If I didn\u2019t need health insurance, I would still be living on a commune.'\n\nBut it couldn\u2019t last, especially after commune members began having children. Coyote says that those with families came to resent the free spirits who wanted to hang around getting high all day. And when conflicts arose, those in the commune didn\u2019t have the tools to resolve them. In the end, members began separating themselves from the rest of the group.\n\n'What we learned is that we are the problem. We grew up in this culture, with bad habits, impulses, egoism, selfishness and everything else. We could pretend we didn\u2019t but it wasn\u2019t actually true,' Coyote said. 'We were so intent on building a new world, we didn\u2019t concentrate as fully as we should\u2019ve on building our lives.\u201d", "created_at": "2017-09-23 19:28:32.890032", "updated_at": "2017-09-23 19:28:32.890032", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 707, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 96.4, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 3769, 3704], "is_private": false}, {"id": 37024, "user_id": 3769, "topic_id": 7191, "post_number": 3, "raw": "thank you", "created_at": "2017-09-26 14:23:30.027336", "updated_at": "2018-01-01 19:04:30.386974", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 93.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 1935], "is_private": false}, {"id": 79420, "user_id": 3622, "topic_id": 13894, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Will do this", "created_at": "2020-06-23 12:04:01.822621", "updated_at": "2020-06-23 12:04:01.822621", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 3, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 6.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [79399], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 88755, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 15076, "post_number": 33, "raw": "[quote=\"Bohjort, post:31, topic:15076\"]\nI would love do discuss this more, I have some other examples on how effort affect learning!\n[/quote]\n\nThat would certainly be interesting.", "created_at": "2020-12-09 18:21:01.106949", "updated_at": "2020-12-09 18:21:01.106949", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 29, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 7.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [88753], "is_reply_to": [88753], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 85559, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 14646, "post_number": 8, "raw": "Sorry, corrected now.

He moved to Brussels earlier this year with the intention of setting up a coliving here.\n\nThe group of Wallons and then more Flemish people met in covid times end of May, beginning of June. Robert interviewed all the people. He advertised it in early May - 4 facebook sites and 2 big community sites: Sammenhausen and Habitat de participation group\u00e9 in FR, EN, NL. In the end in the mix of people expats were a minority. 10-12 people out of 30 started actively looking for places.. They went to many visits, then started making the dossiers and giving them to the owners. Many places did not accept to rent to 'colocataires' (French for co-habitants).\n\nNow: they found a 100 year old house in the Churchill area, in Brussels. It had 8 bedrooms and 9 people very committed, so they had to kick someone out. This problem was solved using protective foam padding to split the big master bedroom into 2. It cost 1000 eur in materials. They did it very carefully, and showed it to the landlord only *after* doing it, without asking for permission. Because the solution worked, the landlord then approved.\n\nThey had also seen Chateaux (Fr for castels) with more bedrooms, but they were looking for diplomats, families, stable group. Mainly the real estate agents act as gatekeepers and don't even introduce them to the owners - very conservative owners and agents.\nNow 9 rooms rented out - people switching rooms back and forth.\n\nSome of the 30people have been living here, even though they were not part of the 9, so in practice they are about 12.

Mixed languages, but mostly English.\n\n*We were very clear, it's not a colocation, but a community.*\n*We have cleaning schedule, common food purchasing - food is bought from a local coop/farmers so everything is ecological, local. We have weekly community meetings, common meals once a day, rotating who's cooking. Mostly vegan and gluten free.* - Robert says.\n \nThe 30 people want to stick together, difft people found different solutions, and the house is at the center. Now they are planning an event where they invited a presentation from one community member who went to Sweden to the 'mother community' and spent a month there with her partner.\n\nHow did the interviewing process go: \nThey had a google form in 3 languages with clear information also available in the ads.\nEven after they closed, some people still applied - but at some point they had to close.\nMany people wanted separate apartment, not house rental. - not realistic, to find a house with mini apartments.\nSome people backed out when they saw the group is larger than what they had in mind. 'I wouldn't be interested in living with more than 4 people'; others had to live in specific parts of Brussels. The families in particular couldn't work with the solution - in the end, no children.\n\nOthers in the community who were fluent in NL, FR had to deal with the contracts etc.. so it's really a flat organisation.\n\nDid the Liking factor matter? How much you like and trust someone? It was more of a self-selection, some people wanted to move at different times etc. Robert was in a big hurry - so in the end it came to be with the people who were aligned and had the energy of moving quickly.\nNow many stayed in the group of 30.\n\nIn the end, the people who were ready to move the quickest and were most flexible are quite young, don't have children and attachments etc.\n\nColoc contract - with 7 signatories, and all the costs are divided by 9.\nLuckily, the rooms have very similar quality. 290eur - 350eur per room.\n\nIt's an interim solution, a 3year contract which could last for 20 years.\n\nECOLISE has a dream of setting up very Reef-ish in Brussels, a more modelled community, an urban large center which could house Ecolise HQ but also a lot of community organisation (ideally residential), and a farm at the edge of Brussels which could demonstrate ecological solutions.\n\n*We got together often and got to know each other well before we moved in - camping, cooking together etc. A lot of collective work in the house visiting and bidding.*\n\nNow we are locked in a house that's not very ecological. \n\nMost people are 26-30, Robert is the oldest one.\n2 students, 1 intern, 1 psychologist/NGO worker, 1 engineer inspecting plastic recycling, someone working with The Democratic School (also ngo), teacher, 1 unemployed.\nIn the 30 group - many health workers, predominantly females.\n2 of the women have arranged to live in tiny houses in Anderlecht.\n\nA closed facebook group where their community organises and shared information.\nThe fb group is animated by Robert and there's a need for people to stay together.\n\nNext steps for the Reef group: people who are interested can request to join the facebook group and find others with similar plans. We are still thinking about the need to make a move but also to think long term - to have capacity to adapt the space, make modifications, and also to have a solid agreement financially that allows for god stewardship.", "created_at": "2020-10-14 07:43:59.174154", "updated_at": "2020-10-15 04:49:27.631548", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 942, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 56.8, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 3816, 2536], "is_private": false}, {"id": 41748, "user_id": 3791, "topic_id": 8069, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Hi @anique.yael :slight_smile:\n\nIt is very thoughtful of you.

This is a core discussion because depending on how we will fund fraternity we will built a very different ways of cooperation and sharing: institutionalized through governments, NGOs, lobbies, associations, etc. in the Aristotelian way or through peer networks and small interconnected clusters in the Epicurean.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-05-30 11:01:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:22.978013", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 106, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [25834], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 75591, "user_id": 5528, "topic_id": 13171, "post_number": 22, "raw": "[quote=\"daveed, post:19, topic:13171\"]\nGoogle Sheet\n[/quote]\n\nHi @daveed\nGreat!

Confusingly, his populist coalition partners, the 5 stars movement, stand by the 500,000 estimate, which could make policy decisions tricky.\n\nBad news: someone else gets to be the scapegoat now.

I'm inspired by your routine and hope to report back one of my own these days. For me, it's mostly life as I knew it before this mess started. I've been working from home for a while now (years, afraid to count) and, having grown an introvert side to what usually reads as an available human ready to cheer people up, I have to admit at times this no socialisation thing feels like a relief. Like more people are living life as I am. \n\nWhen considering the bigger consequences, these deep shifts are scary af. The economic implications are starting to show around me in friends, generally freelancers, NGOers or small entrepreneurs, already feeling precarious, knowing this is just the beginning. I haven't figured out how to be a better friend to them. A close friend subtly mocked me today by reminding me how optimistic I was a few days ago by saying that this might shock the system into something else, after making visible to many the terribly flawed deep / policy design. I'm in a more sober state of mind today. The pain is coming for most of us. Not sure if the promise of a better, fairer world will be soothing enough. \n\nI'm still in an energy saving mode trying to make sense of the shifts in my own professional agenda, while keeping close to family. Small support here and there with my neighbours, who are generally lucky enough to have family around them. Several ideas of contributing to conversations worth having, some that I feel I've waited long for, on systems change and public service redesign, that are both timely and tiresome to those who I could engage in conversation with. They might be just trying to stabilise first, change the world second. I'm just wondering how long (and if) that might take. How to balance something that feels like momentum with self-care and patience with oneself, first. \n\nA recent discovery is the mindfulness grey area. I'm going at it randomly and enjoy not having a guide to \"the proper ones\" vs the bullshit ones. Recently attempted 10 min of app-directed yoga and enjoyed it. Will do more. Still have to structure my days and master the sense of complete uncertainty, I'd be happy to keep close and read others' journey. \n\nP.S. Unexpected insight: working online (calls especially) is incredibly tiring. I would have thought I've been working like that for years, but it's been solitary work, generally, that I've enjoyed and protected as a favourable condition.

Do you think this is feasible to develop in 2-3 months and how much would it cost?[/quote]\n\nThe login flow is difficult to change, as it is a Discourse core function and also integrates with the communities.edgeryders.eu shared accounts that we have now. The consent form is only needed for edgeryders.eu, so we don't want to show it to each and everyone signing up on communities.edgeryders.eu.\n\nHowever, there are other options, some of which I discussed with Nadia several times already. For example, we can have a form for choosing a username, entering an e-mail address, giving consent and creating a topic in a certain category, all in one. A password would be sent to that e-mail address, so that people can log in under the same identity when they want to contribute to the discussion under their topic. Also, when they get the password by e-mail, they can't lose it. We'll have lots of spambot issues with such a form of course, so we'll need a captcha and moderator approval (which would happen inside Discourse).\n\nAssume 3000 \u2013 4000 EUR for that kind of functionality. Of that, 1000 EUR we could cover from the H2020 IT budgets, as such a form would make it simpler for people to contribute there as well.

You can, and should, zoom out to country level \u2013 you might find experienced rural geohackers, who are very precious.</li>\n\n<li>Click on the icons representing the most senior contributors. A pop-up opens with statistics on the person. Explore them particularly important to us is the date of the latest contribution you find under \"How did he/she contribute to OSM?\".

Three walking minutes from the beach.\n\n**Description.** In total the space that can be rented in this house (which is everything except one apartment) contains 3 kitchens, 5 bedrooms, 3 full bathrooms and 2 toilets.\n\nThe ground level contains three apartments with one sleeping room, one kitchen and one bathroom each (see the last few photos). One apartment was occupied and would not be included in the rent. Upstairs there is a nice large living room, three bedrooms and a kitchen.\n\nAll upstairs rooms have access to the large rooftop terrace. The ground floor rooms have access to the garden, which is quite huge (and has a swimming pool). There is also a land next to the house that we can rent for a festival. \"The house and land around is huge.\"\n\nSo in total, five sleeping rooms are available, which could fit a maximum of 15 people at 3 per room (one double bed already inside, and single beds could be added). But of course, we don't need to host 15 people.\n\n**Condition.** \n\n**Equipment.** Fully furnished.\n\n**Price.** Usually the owner just rents out the upper floor, but agreed that for 800 EUR/month (960 USD/month) we can we can get access to the two apartments downstairs as well. At another occasion, a number of 1000 EUR/month (1170 USD/month) was floated for that by @unknown_author. We have to find out in detail in the negotiation.\n\n**Owner.** See the [contact info](/t/id/7171/2) section (access protected).\n\n**Comments.**\n\n* \"The place is cute, really. The apartments downstairs are slightly darkish.\" \u2013 @unknown_author \n* \"Comment: furnished is nice, but it adds a kind of liability in having to keep the landlord's stuff in nice shape.\" \u2013 @johncoate \n\n**Questions.**\n\n* When fitting 3 people into each of the 5 rooms, where would the workspace be?\n* Would the third, inaccessible apartment in the ground floor be part of the space when renting it?

Because this cannibalises attention and is difficult to manage.\n* At the same time it is important to have professionals for copywriting, visual design, video production, press engagement etc that can produce high quality results on a short timeline - rather than rely on community members to do this. So we recruit a roster of freelancers who are our go to people and have a set budget of time/requests for content available to any communication team.\n* Languages and geographic locations.

We agree to anything, when that unlocks a service we need. Imagine you had one of these amazing data wallets, allowing you to authorize which services can access which personal data. Now imagine that your bank, or your keystone social networking service, told you \"I want access to _all_ of your data, or else you don't get an account from me.\" What are you going to do? You cannot function in modern society without a bank account (or, some would say, a Facebook account). So you agree. You agree to _anything at all_. That's not because of any technological issue. It's _because you have no power_.\n\n\nWe have been in a similar situation before. In the early 20th century, for-profit companies operated public utilities like energy, water, rail transport. This happened because of technological reasons: building two aqueducts in the same city is wasteful. The first company that builds an aqueduct can obtain monopoly of water provision in that city, and maintain it forever. This was called a [natural monopoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_monopoly). Today's \"network externalities\" provoke a similar effect, and for similar reasons.\n \nThis situation led to massive profits, driven by the power imbalance between monopolist providers and users; to the exclusion of less affluent users; and to rent extraction, pushing potentially viable businesses into the red.  Europe responded with antitrust legislation, with its array of policy tools: nationalizations, tight regulation by specialized agencies, and direct provision, with public sector actors starting their own water, energy, and transport companies. Municipalism played a major role here: where the state would respond too slowly, or not at all, cities stepped into the breach, at least in some countries (including Italy). It is maybe not a coincidence that the strongest critical voice claiming to reduce the power of business was [Francesca Bria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesca_Bria)'s \u2013 Europe's digital municipalist-in-chief. \n\nIt comes down to game theory. If I had the personal data wallet right now, and my bank would refuse to accept it, saying \"nah, you have to fill this online form\"; or if it _did_ accept it, but only under the condition that they get access to the whole thing... I would consent. What can I do? Now, if the European institutions owned a trusted operator that _would_ accept that data wallet in an equitable way, now I could tell my bank \"fair enough, I'll take my business elsewhere\". This way, the game has a completely different equilibrium. \n\nConclusion: maybe, in order to get this stuff adopted, you need antitrust policy. Makes sense?", "created_at": "2019-09-25 14:44:58.485927", "updated_at": "2019-09-26 08:14:00.944869", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 458, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 82.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 586, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 553, "post_number": 1, "raw": "We develop the shortest possible food supply chains to support small-scale farmers and a healthy nutrition.

Of course an acoustic modem would work (at slow speeds at least), but since GSM is digital, there could be much better options :) It would still be slow, but the advantage is that the local knowledge servers could sync themselves during the night (when there's little load on the phone network), and take their time for it.

The text is a bit raw, but I hope some of the ideas are useful to this forum.\n\n   -----\n\nMy name is Michelle Thorne, and I work for the Mozilla Foundation. We're behind the browser Firefox. And for the last few years, we've been working on internet health.\n\nI got first gotten interested in all things internet about 15 years ago.\n\nI was actually a very passionate early Wikipedia when the project was just getting started. And I remember telling everybody I knew like my university professors, \"there's this amazing website that lets you edit all these these different articles. And it's all the world's knowledge and all the world's languages.\" And I just thought that was the most ambitious and coolest thing on the internet. And so that was kind of my window into free culture and open source. After going to the first week of Wikimania in Frankfurt, Germany, I learned about Creative Commons, where I later worked. And after being at Creative Commons for a few years, started to work at the Mozilla Foundation. So the idea of, you know, open, participatory, global, ambitious digital projects has always been the big job for me.\n\nI'm really interested in the internet, and the role it plays in society. I see it as a global public resource, and something really worthy of attention and care. I think one of the challenges we see today is that participation is more complicated than it was, let's say, in the earlier days of the internet, we've seen the rise of these big centralized platforms, which use their corporate policies to control how you participate. There is very little governance from the user side, and how those platforms might change or respond to people's needs. And we're also seeing the rise of behaviors online, hate speech and other kinds of violence aggravating actions that have kind of put people into retreat, or help to polarize people. So we have other social media platforms who really benefit from benefit from outrage and benefit from content that gets, quote, engagement. But it's actually creating a kind of polarized atmosphere online, and people are retreating and participating less, or just participating in their smaller groups and just talking about the average. \n\nSo it's become a kind of, at least in my experience, and what I've heard anecdotally and seen in some studies, just the internet as a place of participation is a lot more money, the Mozilla foundation on on the team that I'm on, we support all sorts of leaders in the internet health movement, who are tackling these different kinds of issues. So there's a whole group of people, Camille included, who are talking about misinformation, and how do you combat the rise of misinformation online? People talking about how do we talk about hate speech and radicalized speech online. And we also run a bunch of campaigns around these topics that I've been working on the last few years is the Internet of Things, and how to make it more responsible, more open, more private, and also include these ideas of participation and co-creation, because the Internet of Things has typically been a lot of black box appliances, without a lot of in a real agency to change them.\n\nThe IoT projects, I think, get it right or on the right path are ones that are open in their designs and their code and in their explanation of their business model and around like, how how the thing works, and also how did this thing comes to be in terms of supply chain, and in terms of the materials and things that go into it, as well as the third parties that work with it. So there's a whole, for me, openness is starting to become a much broader, you know, includes many things are, you know, transparency and how that device is made. What that device interacts with, in addition to the licensing of a name, it's like codes. And I think that those practices help to build trust. Because when you can see that an audit that information you can better understand is this a service or product that I'm willing to trust. And I think part of what that openness is about is around disclosing what happens with your data, what partners that company is in contact with or, partnering with, what their IT security update policies are, these are all things that help you make an informed decision whether you will trust this device with your data, and therefore, consider it a privacy worth preserving.\n\nIn general I think we put too much pressure on the individual to have to protect themselves and all sorts of areas of our lives, technology, internet, it's just one of them. I do think there are responsibilities of governments and corporations. And I think we're seeing the rise of, thanks to digital tools, some sort of collective agency and collective bargaining. So pools of users able to put together their demands, their needs, their permissions, and through more collective bargaining, able to negotiate. And so I think that for me, that's a kind of a new area worthy of more exploration and others that some people may be sitting in this network are looking at things like digital cooperatives. And I think that that's going to be a really interesting place. Because yeah, I think, only putting the burden on the individual to have to understand all these different policies, all the different permissions, all the different technical capabilities. And do this in like the seconds of free time they have between their otherwise strapped lives is unfair, and not a society I want to advocate for.\n\nI started the Mozilla Foundation, when Mark Surman, the executive director, had also just recently joined. And he had the ambition to take the Mozilla Foundation, which was pretty strongly just focused on Firefox, the browser, and maybe a little bit the web as a platform, and said, like, we need to be fueling a movement for the help of the internet. And so his application blog post is called A Million Mozillians. And at the time, that was a quite radical and ambitious proposal to the organization. And so I've been working with him for over a decade, and the things that I have done and have helped to make that vision a reality. Little bit, these projects started off with what's called the Mozilla Festival. And the idea was, let's bring together these different, primarily open players in the open space. So we had people from open hardware, open science, open education. And we had Wikipedia there, you know, we had a collection of project open video, there was a smattering of these open efforts around the world. And we thought let's bring them together. And here's a look at also learn from all these different movements that we're applying openness to other fields. So that's where you build your rainbow coalition, so to speak. Okay. And that helps give us specific projects and people that we could be investing in and supporting over the years. And what's interesting is even over a decade that's had for various permutations, but a lot of the key ideas still continue. So I still think I still use convenience as this really important way to bring together a coalition, a network of people who might otherwise not work together, to really create, like, a new community of practice out of these diverse groups. And by working on specific and achievable projects, you are able to actually give people like a collaborative substrate that lets something move forward. So I think that those some of those templates that still continue. And I have definitely learned over the years, but I think those are are quite powerful tools, especially in the nonprofit space.\n\nOne theme that kind of emerged through that work of the years, which also include included web literacy, and being part of the kind of learn to code movement was this idea of before the first falling at the Physical Web. \n\nDepending on circle you're in, you would sometimes say different words to what we set out on IoT, because that started just to be the term that was getting more traction. But anyways, I partnered with a professor from the University of Dundee, Jon Rogers, who I had worked with for many years through the Mozilla Festival, we just really got along and just said, like, hey, every time we talk, there's all sorts of ideas and things that we can be working on. So let's just Skype with each other once a week, and see where it goes. And so for a few months, you know, he came from a design research background, really interested in the physical aspects of the web and of interaction as an electrical engineer. I was coming from this digital rights, free culture, participatory open perspective. And so we would just mash together ideas. And then it emerged, we could actually make some sort of program that could be hosted with Mozilla and the University of Dundee, that tried to take those different values and approaches and apply to Internet of Things. \n\nSo we started the Open IT Studio in 2016, with the idea of, let's support a community of practice of designers, technologists, philosophers, historians, digital rights advocates, to talk about what can we do to make it a healthier space for humans. And I think that project was quite successful, definitely a highlight of my career, there were a few things that came out of it that might be interesting for people to check out. One I can recommend is the Anatomy of AI, which is a collaboration between Vladan Joler from Share Labs and Kate Crawford from AI Now, which just won design of the year and was acquired by the V&A museum for their permanent collection. \n\nAnd they took an Amazon Alexa. And they said, let's do a truly exploded view. So in design, you have this thing called exploded me, which usually just shows you the physical parts that go into device. But we said with connected devices, the story is much bigger than just the small material parts that go into it. So <what I'm?> created the most amazing map, it's four meters by four meters, which was exhibited at the V and A Museum in London and has toured around Europe and beyond. And it's shows you the lifecycle of an Amazon Alexa from the mining and the smelting and the production of the components to then when it's actually running all of the data centers and content moderation advertising to the end of life, recycling, and others and otherwise discarding of the device and what is the true cost of Amazon Alexa; what really goes into it. And I think that for me, that project, The Anatomy of AI, is such a great touchstone for when we think about IoT. Often we talk about IoT, we just see a smart light bulb, or we often just see an object, you know, some sort of traffic light or something. But it's really the new vast network of stuff before, during and after that device where things get really interesting. So I think that that for me was just such a great example of bringing that to life.\n\nThis is a long saga. We're not even in just the last minutes, it's actually the beginning of a whole new day, a whole new 24 hours, because so for example, Amazon Alexa, it's sold incredibly cheaply. I mean, compact, like it's very inexpensive device. But some of the main things it's doing is it's becoming a much more direct portal for people to order things from Amazon. But probably more importantly, it's become a whole voice snippet, like gathering system, which is powering Amazon's Alexa, that is probably the true value of having your Alexa in everyone's home. For me it like that with working with Open IoT Studio and with Jon, and with our collaborators or whichever one Peter, this kind of growing conversation amongst technologists, different professionals in the tech sector around how do we make the internet especially these newer emerging technologies within associated with Internet? How do we make them more understandable? How do we make decisions that lead to these products being more responsible, or the people making them be more responsible? So I think some of it is about transparency and understanding. So things like this map. \n\nAnd some of it are tools, like one project that we worked on together the TrustMark, the trust mark for IoT, which is something that you can then use as a tool for vetting whether your product needs a certain standard and hoping to be giving users some agency and figuring out like, is this something that I really want to have in my home or my life?\n\nI think the place where we have the most effect, maybe some better leverage, is working with other professionals and practitioners. Because those are, that's an audience. That's kind of a more notable in size and scale, or size, and just and profile. And those are people who are making daily decisions in their lives that go into those products. So those were our key audiences. So working with Jon: he's teaching next generation product designers. So we had a whole thing around education, from undergraduate to graduate. And now we have a PhD program funded by the EU looking at responsible IoT, I think this idea of what are we doing in the higher education space to train people going into the field that will have these kinds of considerations, as well as people who are in the field who are making kind of daily decisions, and then also all sorts of kind of user advocates. So we work with Consumer Reports, we work with nonprofits, we work in the digital rights space, all these people were kind of advocating on behalf of users. And they love these kinds of examples and tools, because it helps them give point to something maybe a little more tangible or intuitive than just a policy briefing.\n\nI was recently reflecting with a friend of mine that when in college, I studied critical social thought. And we did a lot of thinking and writing, but very little making. And if I could recreate my degree I would have critical social and critical making as my double major. Because I think you're right, I think actually the, let's say the makers, I think we're seeing this in the computer science departments and the design departments, engineering departments of all kinds are getting a lot more ethics curriculum and support to think about the ethical components of their work. I think that's on the rise. It's on the rise, but I think some of the other humanities actually don't do enough making of their own. So I'm sure when you're studying law, you would very, very few project would actually encourage you to do anything like make a trust, like a prototype, just mark that actually tries to put some of your law practice into something more tangible. And I I'm a firm believer that we learn through making and even though I'm not a skilled maker, I think that this is a an amazing process to try to turn ideas into something tangible, something that's testable, something that lives in another mode.\n\nWe exhibited at the V&A during digital design weekend, and you get, like 25,000 people come through, and check out our work. And you have to talk to all sorts of people from all walks of life. And so yes, a lot of it's contextual, but who you're in front of. But I find in general, many people have a smartphone, most smartphones have some sort of voice assistant running on them. I think a smartphone is one of people's first IoT devices in this way. And so actually talking to people about their phone, how do they use their phone and the user voice assistant? What do they think about that? Do they know where that data is going? What do they think about those companies have it, it's all those funny stories around? Accent accents being misunderstood, like the Scottish person trying to talk to Siri, in these people really relate to those stories, and have their own experiences with them. And that becomes kind of a channel through which you can talk about some of these other internet health issues.\n\nI'm seeing increasingly people who don't want their work to be adding to the shadiness in the world. Dot Everyone just released a really great study around tech workers and their attitudes, was focused on the UK, but they showed that I think one in five tech workers, is ready to leave a job if the employers makes an error, like an unethical decision, which cost the company like 30,000 times. So I think this is anecdotally and then also in the sector, more people want to have ethical decisions in what they build. And so I'm actually finding more people, who you don't have to convince them that these are things to work on. It's more that was more how oftentimes, you'll find that people are people who work in the tech sector are coming up against the business of the company is the thing that is at odds, it may be not their product manager or their design team, everyone's on board. But you have you coming down to some bigger question around like, how is that company financed? And so I think some of the big innovations of the coming decade will actually be around reforming our economic models.\n\nI think of how this OpenDoTT PhD program came to life. And thanks to the maintenance of the European Commission to prioritize these kinds of training networks, which seems to be a unique thing in the world that they say we need to get universities and in the industry together to think and to move forward to these new kinds of trainings. And especially they were interested in things like a nonprofit like Mozilla, who really focus on these more societal implications of technology. So I think that's a really amazing that they even have this kind of like structure. So it's going to be a three year PhD program that actually the there's five PhD students who are at this moment moving to Dundee, Scotland to start next week. And they come, they come from all over the world. And the idea is that they're going to be researching, through design practices, their philosophical practices through coding practices, and legal practices, ways to advance a healthier Internet of Things. So what that will look like in practice is like, very much going to be determined on what they bring to it. But we focused on different layers of where we see it playing out from the body, to the home to the neighborhood, in the city. And then we also did a cross cutting project or on the trustmark, and helps to try to bring those ideas together. So I'm quite excited to see what it's like, I think, to have a PhD program paired with a nonprofit is exciting, they're going to also come to facility Berlin, for a year and a half to be more embedded in our office here. And then they're being advised by an array of really amazing organizations who are at the forefront of this responsible space, moving things on, simply secure.  I want to take this program, as much as I want to run it.\n\nThe stat that really set me back was learning that the internet contributes 2% of the world's global carbon emissions, which basically puts it on par with the airline industry. I think for a long time, we've lived in some sort of digital denial that the internet is physical, in that sense, in the sense that it requires environmental resources and adds to pollution. But as in the tech sector, we've never shied away from imagining different futures and innovating. So it's actually a place where I think the internet both is a heavy contributor to emissions, as well as it can be an amazing tool to reduce its own as well as used to mobilize and organize for climate action.\n \nRecently, I've been really interested in the idea of becoming carbon neutral Internet, and what it would take to reduce those emissions. The great news is that there are many wonderful humans of the internet who are interested in this in this problem as well. And there's already like an array of actions that are happening from moving data centers to renewables, to designing websites and web services that have a lower footprint, to extending the life of connected devices, there's a whole bunch of things people are doing that in aggregate can actually reduce emissions. And so for me, that's really exciting, not just thinking about it in the internet sector, but also just seeing the mobilization around a climate agenda. We see that really strongly here in Germany with Friday's for Future, and the recent European elections, this I think, strong mandate from the public to do something about it. And I've really taken that kind of momentum to heart. \n\nWithin Mozilla, we started a small group of people who are pushing for more climate activism within the organization, which you can expect to hear more from soon. And just being more involved and also learning. There's a lot to learn about, about the climate crisis. But I think it's something that now when I think about  what does it mean to be responsible technologists, I think previously, I really saw it as being around openness and privacy, inclusion, and all these topics. But now I'm increasingly seeing it has to also include the climate and kind of moving up or probably down the stack really deeper into the base layers. I keep putting like penthouses on it, but actually basement that needed investigation. People that I've spoken to have felt this kind of dissonance between amazing internet future that, for example, that me and all these open movement people have been advocating for, and the hard reality of the climate crisis, but I think there's a way to actually address that dissonance head on and not be paralyzed in action, but actually to do something about it. That's, that's where I'm at at the moment.\n\nJust think about this project being in the context of the European Union. In much of my work over the years, I've really seen the European Union be this kind of beacon of hope, from be it from a regulatory perspective, be it from an agenda setting perspective be addressed from like a celebration of multiculturalism will do lingual ism. And now, also putting the climate high on the high on the priority list. Even as a non EU citizen, I really believe in the project of the EU. And  I think it's one of the most modern and exciting things that is happening on the planet, I think for the EU to really be invested in a thought leader around what the internet could be and helping to create this kind of alternative vision for it that are dominated by the prevailing centralized service capitalism models. I think, you know, that hasn't made me more public, public good perspective. I think there's something I really am hopeful for and to help lead. So that's exciting. And one of the reasons I was excited to participate in this project.", "created_at": "2019-12-20 06:23:53.857064", "updated_at": "2020-12-14 19:58:09.238021", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4100, "wiki": false, "reads": 29, "score": 307.8, "like_count": 8, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5698, 8, 206, 2346, 4022, 4934, 428, 224], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13034, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 1454, "post_number": 6, "raw": "Right to assume so, lucyanna.

Essentially, these agreements are there to make banking loans more solid (given that subprimes turned out to be a bad idea), and this means tightening up reserve and other requirements. As a consequence, almost every bank found itself in breach of Basel II (and later III), and had to call up on debtors to cancel their credit lines.

These credit lines feed cutrrent accounts, so canceling them destroys banking money.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-02 09:44:12", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:45.879252", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 140, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 1.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 37318, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 7221, "post_number": 4, "raw": "done", "created_at": "2017-10-02 14:00:11.465715", "updated_at": "2017-10-02 14:00:11.465715", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 57.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [37297], "is_liked_by": [3362], "is_private": false}, {"id": 37317, "user_id": 4040, "topic_id": 7198, "post_number": 12, "raw": "merci pour votre encouragement :)  oui bien que je connais le \"design thinking\" et ce qui le distingue du \"design doing\".", "created_at": "2017-10-02 13:54:58.956986", "updated_at": "2017-10-02 13:54:58.956986", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 20, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 23.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [37241], "is_liked_by": [3769], "is_private": false}, {"id": 70974, "user_id": 5333, "topic_id": 7122, "post_number": 62, "raw": "Hi Joshua!

Also, it's not that hard for Banks to increase capital - they can do it from their own profits if they want to - and they only have to increase it as a small fraction (between 1/10 and 1/20 or more) of their total loans. However, if they take sufficient loan losses then that they can't cover them from profits, then it does hit their capital, and of course the multiplier relationship is fatal when it goes into reverse. Which is why the high securitization losses are so interesting.\n\nHowever...\n\nBanks are also restricted from lending by something called \"liquidity\" which is essentially the amount of money they have within the clearing system, and on deposit at the central bank. This is a completely different set of restrictions on lending - and what i was getting at with the issue of money being transferred from Italy in the Bank of Italy's report. That's a more likely explanation for the short term market to seize up.\n\nPart of the problem is that economists don't seem to want to think about there being a ceiling on the total amount of debt any society can support, and that this gets split between government, business activity and personal activity. If you allow or encourage governments to borrow excessively it comes out of the economy somewhere else.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-02 18:45:37", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:45.979204", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 261, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 1.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [12018], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 83511, "user_id": 4096, "topic_id": 14419, "post_number": 3, "raw": "If it was an actual POPREBEL event then yes, but I know some were labelled as NGI so in that case no.

Growing a biohacker space from scratch is definitely not a small undertaking! However, there are many others globally who were in a similar position as you.

I am in total agreement with @noemi & @alberto about needing a small team of people around you to help realize Nebras' mission. That means even looking outside the biological/scientific community, and reaching out to those that support your vision, be it open source & hardware advocates, educators, etc as your strongest champions (in reference to 3.1). \n\nIn 2.1, I would try to increase the impact of what a biohacker space would do, and the 'value proposition' of its existence; it is meeting a specific need that is outside of institutions and makes science and our bodies immediately relatable.

As we don't use <a href=\"/admin/config/people/accounts/display\">Account settings: Manage display</a> any more (see above), field groups are not available for the rendering.

That's why the profile page now even looks uglier than before: I left the design job to you ;-) This change also means that the order of fields in the <em>rendered</em> profile is no longer controlled by the <a href=\"/admin/config/people/accounts/display\">Account settings: Manage display</a> page.

This kind of research requires, a very interdisciplinary approach, looking at both conceptions of privacy and surveillance, and also looking at what communities need.\n\nMost recently, I\u2019ve started working on online services, studying them also as a way to show the ways in which software industries have changed. In my current work, I\u2019m trying to conceptualize how software is developed today, what kind of political economy software companies are functioning in, and how that affects the kind of systems they develop. I then tie this work to what this means for computer science and how we can do computer science differently.\n\nOutside of my day job, I work with artists and activists and civil society in Brussels. I\u2019ve been working with a feminist artist collective, called ConstantVZW. They do a number of project and organize different events around free software, artistic practice and collective digital practices. For example, they are currently having a work session on \u201ccollective conditions\u201d, which focuses on thinking about how to deal with the way in which collectivity and technology is imagined They invite participants to imagine protocols of care, alternative futures, differences etc. that are layered on top of the protocols that drive current day services, that could allow our collectivities to exist in the extractive socio-technical world that we currently live in. The collaboration with Constant and other groups is an important part of my work: I work with these different communities as a way to think about and develop methodologies for a different computer science, a different technology, or a different life together with technology. This work builds on previous engagements regarding migration, gender and anti-racism in Europe, and digital rights in Turkey.\n\nRoots\nI was born and raised in Turkey. I already tried to go abroad when I was just a child. M family didn\u2019t really have the means for such a wish, but I was always searching for possibilities to go abroad. And part of it was because I wanted to study international relations. If I had stayed in Turkey, I would become an engineer, because I was very good at math and sciences. But at that time, I loved math, but I was sure I didn\u2019t want to be an engineer.\n\nI managed to go abroad. I went to the US. I was there for five years, and then I got a scholarship to go to Germany. I stayed in Germany for 13 years. But somehow, math and engineering did not leave me. So, I decided to combine them.\n\nMy undergrad was in international relations and mathematics. In my final report before graduating I looked at the way in which game theory was used during the Cold War. John von Neumann, among other things a famous computer scientist, actually believed that it would be rational for the US to do a nuclear strike first, i.e., he believed in first-strike. He bolstered his argument using mathematics, specifically, game theory, in order to rationalize and deem \u201cobjective\u201d a very devastating political position. As a young person interested in international relations and at home with mathematics, I was very intrigued by the use of mathematics that I, at the time, also thought was absolutely neutral and objective in the pursuit of devastating imperial politics.\n\nMaybe some of this interest was due to the time my family and I spent in Sofia, Bulgaria when I was a kid. Bulgaria then was a communist country. As a kid, I was quite impressed by communism vis-a-vis how Turkey was doing at the same time. We were there because my father was appointed the Turkish military attach\u00e9. Turkey was and kind of still is an ally of the US. This had consequences for our life in Bulgaria, and in a sense, the Cold War really colored our lives. Growing up in the cold war and, much later, going to the US and seeing the US framing of the same war forced me to try to grasp what the nuclear arms race was about and how we got there? My field of study helped me understand it better.\n\n \n\nLater in my life, when I became interested and involved in the feminist critique of computing and mathematics, I came to understand better the many ways in which mathematics is not neutral. People believe numbers are neutral, or that mathematical concepts or abstractions don\u2019t have political relevance. However, every time you use a mathematical language, let\u2019s say to model the world, you have to make some assumptions. The numbers may make it seem as if things expressed in formal languages are neutral, but in fact \u2014 we see again and again \u2014 that this is not the case.\n\nPrisoner\u2019s Dilemma\u2019s Problems\nThe prisoner\u2019s dilemma, a commonly used example of a game used in game theory, was subject to much research at the RAND Corporation, a US military think-tank. In the prisoner\u2019s dilemma, two prisoners can snitch on each other with punishments distributed in such a way that if any or two players snitch they are worse off. The objective was to demonstrate that \u201crational beings\u201d might prefer not to cooperate even if it is not in their self-interest. One of the main researchers involved in developing theories around this game was John Nash. The legend goes that he and his colleagues asked secretaries at the RAND Corporation to play the game. But there was a glitch: the secretaries would cooperate instead of choosing for themselves. So, Nash simply dismissed them, calling them unfit subjects of the game. It was the same game, the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma that was later used to rationalize that it would be better if the US would strike first.\n\nThe story around Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma is good example of how the model makes assumptions about humans being selfish and always after maximum gain, an assumption that percolates through economics, social choice theory etc.\n\nThe game, used as a model of the world and our behavior in it has a lot of appeal.  It is a simple model\u2014 with lots of assumptions folded into a very simple model. Once you have such models running, you can start making a lot of statements about the world. You can then build on top of these models, build systems that manage life at scale. But with that, you also expose a lot of people to the potential violence that comes from these assumptions.\n\nLinking Politics and Computer Sciences\nI got a scholarship and moved to Berlin to study computer science. To be honest, it was more of an economic decision. A lot of my friends from college had moved to Silicon Valley during the first tech-bubble at the end of the 90s. I was self funding and I was on students visas that had run out. So I thought, okay, maybe I should study computer science as a way to get a job, earn money and apply for a visa to go back to the US.\n\nIn Berlin, I started working with feminist computer scientists. During my study, I focused on security and privacy. That work led me to meet people like Andreas Pfitzmann, a cryptographer who had moved into the field of privacy enhancing technology. They were coming up with new theories of security. For example, they argued that the objective of a computer scientist is not to secure the system, but to build systems that secure the interests of the different actors who are using and are affected by that system. And that really appealed to me.\n\nI became interested in the question related to the different factors of stakeholders to a system and how they have different security interests. That\u2019s what we should be enabling and not protecting systems for their own sake. That\u2019s how I got into privacy technologies. This was also politically very interesting. A lot of security comes from the military domain. Businesses employ security as a way to secure the assets of the company. So, by realizing we should be securing different stakeholders, we were able to start acting on security and privacy in a very different way.\n\nPrivacy was often in juxtaposition to security: it was about protecting the users from the service providers themselves. You would see the user needs instead of \u201cassets\u201d as the driving force of your designs. That is how I got to the general question in my research: is there another computer science possible? Let\u2019s say a computer science that doesn\u2019t assume that our job as computer scientists is to secure assets of companies or governments, but one that secures and protects the needs of users and their environments.\n\nA changing technical landscape\nI only was back in the US again between 2013 and 2016. When I talked with developers there, I noticed that the way I was taught Software Engineering at the University had completely changed and, basically, was no longer relevant. Let me try to explain what the differences were.\n\nUntil the end of the 90s, it was very typical that software came in a box, which included floppy disks or CD ROMs that contained a copy of the software that you could install on your personal computer. This box was the product of a very specific way to produce software as a product using \u201cwaterfall methodologies\u201d. In waterfall methods, you start with the requirements from the clients, once you have those, you go to your developer team and start turning those requirements into a specification and a design of a machine to be developed. This whole process was slow, like one or two years, and after that you would emerge and pass what you developed back to the client. You would test it with the client to see if it worked. And, ideally it all worked and you were done.\n\nOr, for example with Microsoft, every two to three years a new release of the operating system would be offered. They would go through a similar cycle for each version, and come back in 2-3 years with a new version of the operating system, or other software like Microsoft Office. Once it was ready, you would release the code and put it on a disk to get sold. Once code was released, changes were difficult, so that release date was a big moment and the end of a production cycle. \n\nToday, we do not buy boxes, but open up a browser window to access most software. We access Facebook, Google search or Google Docs, and a host of other \u201cservices\u201d instead of installing them on our computers. With services the code is on a server. The user connects to the server to get the functionality. This is what happens with a web browser.\n\nThis subtle shift has completely changed how software is produced and how the software industry functions. As a result, the political economy of these companies has transformed, turning them into very different kinds of investment objects.\n\nThe last five years I have been trying to understand how the shift has enabled different kinds of software engineering processes, in which developers don\u2019t close themselves up for two years and come back with some software, but you can incrementally and continuously develop software as a service.\n\nAs users we notice the difference in many ways. When you\u2019re using an app, it doesn\u2019t function when you\u2019re offline, because most of the code is somewhere else. Since a release now means releasing to a server and not to a packaged box, the developers have the ability to constantly update and incrementally develop the software. And since most user interactions are also communicated to the server, the developers can observe users\u2019 behavior and tweak the design to get better results. With this feedback loop in place, the industry can now optimize software so that they capture and manipulate user behavior in a way that is aligned with business interests.\n\nFor example, an app might give three or four functionalities to their users, they will then continuously improve on those functionalities. It might be a feature or it might be a button, or it could be the ability to make a call. And they constantly refine that feature based on the feedback they get from how the user uses the service. If you compare Microsoft Office on your personal computer, back then Microsoft didn\u2019t have that information, they had little clue what users were doing with it \u2014 except when complaints bubbled up on online discussion forums or on support lines.\n\nCompare that with Google docs, Google can watch every click, holds all user documents, and can capture all the desirable and undesirable ways in which users interact with their service. Service providers can improve the software using this feedback, and in the process also optimize users behavior towards a certain direction. You can orient the users towards the interests of the company.\n\nAnd this is how I started to understand that we are no longer looking at information and communication technologies, but we\u2019re looking at optimization systems. These are systems that are optimizing features depending on user behavior, and optimizing that behavior based on the interest of the company for the extraction of value.\n\nSo, my collaborators like Martha Poon, Carmela Troncoso, Bekah Overdorf, Joris van Hoboken and others have been asking: if the systems are no longer about information, collection, and knowledge \u2014 which comes with associated problems of surveillance \u2014 but these systems are about optimization, what are their associated problems? And how do we protect the users and their environments?\n\nThe Hidden Truth of Google Maps And Other Apps\nMany of us use Google Maps, or Google-owned Waze, which allows you to beat traffic. If you\u2019re on the freeway, and there\u2019s a traffic jam, Waze can recommend an alternate route. Waze then will say \u201cOkay, get off the freeway, I\u2019ll push you through the surface roads, so that you can get from A to B faster.\u201d In doing so, they\u2019re claiming to optimize the time to travel for the users. But what they\u2019re also doing is that by optimizing your path by putting you through surface roads, they are actually causing more congestion. What they\u2019re doing is putting more traffic onto roads that cannot deal with that kind of congestion. If only a few users do this, they are doing well. But if a lot of users start doing this, you actually increase congestion for everyone. This is something traffic engineers have called the price of anarchy.\n\nWaze basically keeps its users, by promising them the ability to optimize their path. Time to travel from A to B. It optimizes all of its services, so that the users are happy and if the user base grows, it has more location data from people, which can then be used to build new services and overall, keep investors happy.\n\nIn services like Waze, the app is the product of layers and layers of managerial and mathematical forms of optimization. And, at the same time, the app helps optimize asocial selfish driver behavior while congesting surface roads, increasing congestion overall, causing extra traffic expenses for municipalities that now have to deal with hundreds of cars using small roads, increasing accidents, etc. Waze and other optimization systems do not \u201cknow\u201d things, but sense the world and give information to users in order to co-create new geographies and behaviors for the extraction of value. They maximize the extraction of value by externalizing costs onto others, like non-users and their roads and cities. \n\nWaze is very useful in showing how optimization systems function in the world, and in demonstrating the externalities they produce. My collaborates and I are trying to wrap our heads around these optimization systems: how do they function? What are their externalities and how can we protect users, non-users and their environments from them? We have an initial list to say, optimization systems typically: favor optimal users, don\u2019t care about non-users, don\u2019t care about their environmental impact, externalize the costs of errors and experiments, etc.\n\nLet me explain what I mean by the latter: you can experiment with services in a way that you couldn\u2019t with shrink-wrap software. For example, the Waze app: maybe there\u2019s a road near a congested freeway that might be an interesting alternative. However, Waze doesn\u2019t have any users going down that road, so they can\u2019t capture if this road is congested and good to recommend. To find out, they send some of the users down these roads that they don\u2019t have enough sensory information about. Let\u2019s say they don\u2019t want to risk it with their \u201cfavorite\u201d users, so they may prefer to recommend this route to users that are less optimal for their business. The route may turn out well, or turn out to be congested or blocked, a risk externalized onto that selected user. These are examples of methods of exploration and experimentation that allow service providers to optimize their services, while externalizing risks and costs onto users.\n\nI want to be careful here and not fold everything under optimization, because, then we might as well talk about capitalism rather than optimization, but I think these are new technological practices that deserve their own critique. At the same time, it looks a lot like capitalism, too. There is something about the way in which the services are applied in places where they are expeted to bring return on investment, leaving behind many places. Only when these companies are pressured to expand their markets, do they start deploying their services elsewhere. However, it may not be the same quality, or like Facebook did in Myanmar and Bangladesh: without any support for the local languages. It has to do with the logic of extraction, of value driving, how you deploy services.\n\nDon\u2019t Call Them AI Accidents\nWhen we started this work on optimization systems and their externalities, and we\u2019re not sure if we should call these risks and harms externalities. When looked at AI safety papers and we realized their authors call these harms and risks \u201caccidents\u201d. \n\nWe decided not to follow in their steps. These are not accidents. These are deliberate ways of scaling technologies to extract value, while externalizing certain costs onto others. In fact, a lot of the technologies are externalizing risks onto other people.\n\nLet\u2019s take, Uber: normally, you would pay people for the time they work. And now you basically pay people if there are customers. This means that you externalize the risk of not having customers on to individual workers. What you offer them in return is that you will make an optimization system that will give them enough information, so that they can judge when they\u2019re going to take that risk. Uber tells its drivers there will be more customers between 3pm and 5pm. The system is also very attuned to their price optimization. Basically, Uber is constantly putting their drivers into a situation where they are provided with information, so that they can manage their risk. This is how Uber is designed to work. Having seen many examples like thiswe intentionally moved away from calling these negative occurrences \u2018accidents\u2019. \n\nThere is something to be criticized in our work, which is that we assume that this is all very deliberate. And we\u2019re talking about organizations with thousands of people, where sometimes the left hand doesn\u2019t know what the right hand is doing. There are conflicts internally, different power games within the institutions etc.\n\nBut, take autonomous cars as an example: for them to function, you have to remove everything that has a lot of uncertainty from their way. I\u2019m seeing a lot of research now where they\u2019re like, \u201cOkay, how can we still maybe have people in the picture? And the answer is we can profile them all the time. We can constantly monitor people and their behavior and give them control when they fit our expectations and models of risk.\u201d Basically, what they\u2019re imagining is that autonomous cars can only exist if the infrastructure continuously monitors everyone around those cars, and provides agency to those people based on continuous behavioral analysis. None of this is an accident. This is a plan.\n\nI think there\u2019s also another story to be told, which is that Cloud services are a natural progression from the move from shrink-wrapped software in a box to services as we have them now. Some argue services lead to centralization and concentration of computing power, which is optimized to serve all these different services. That\u2019s why we now have Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud, or even the great pivot of Microsoft from being a software company to a cloud company. So, we could say that service architectures pool the clouds to us. \n\nBut you can also turn that story around and say, the cloud is a promise of the software industry to investors, that they can get a lot of people onto the cloud. They should invest in it. In fact, cloud services are fast growing investment objects. Seen this way, autonomous cars are a great way to fulfill the promise of the clouds. In other words, the clouds and their investors are pulling on autonomous cars.\n\nGiven these developments, calling these risks and harms and control infrastructures accidents can only happen if we ignore the whole political economy of software industries. This doesn\u2019t mean that there are no accidents, right? There are accidents. But, I think we have to be very careful not to fall into this idea that they just don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing.\n\nPublic Institutions and Tech Injustice\nI don\u2019t in particular study public institutions, but I have been following the discussions professionally around algorithmic discrimination and fairness, and how concerns around discrimination arise for public institutions.\n\nFor example, I have followed from a distance a proposal for a \u2018lie detector\u2019 AI to be piloted on European borders. They are proposing that this service will help optimize the surveillance at the border and the management of flows. Another example I have heard about is from the Austrian Employment Agency: they are deciding who of the currently unemployed is likely to reenter the workforce in order to only offer those access to re-training. This can be said to be a proposition for optimizing the social welfare state.\n\nYou can imagine that all of these services have been sold, and all of these technologies have been developed, with the idea in mind that these institutions can cut costs and be more efficient at the same time, the main concern being that they may make unfair automated decisions with discriminatory effects.\n\nThis is a very narrow view of the problems that can arise when optimization systems are applied in the public sector. The concern about automated decision with discriminatory effect misses the point that a border system is already a very racialized and very discriminatory system. With regards to social welfare, especially unemployment systems are most likely to impact people with low economic resources, and a good portion of that is likely going to be immigrants. People quickly made the conclusions that border control could be discriminatory or make mistakes. Similar to the Austrian example, there are claims that if you are an immigrant, or a woman with a child, the systems reduces your chances of getting access to resources to re-enter the employment market.\n\nHere we see the trouble with the systems, because they are already racialized and discriminatory systems of population control. That they\u2019re discriminatory is not just at the level of the algorithm, but the whole system. The fact that it\u2019s optimizing over that population is already very problematic, because it\u2019s going to optimize with respect to somebody\u2019s understanding of what is optimal. The discriminatory effect is just an additional factor, but it\u2019s not the main factor. How can government agencies who employ AI start making claims about fairness, when they\u2019re in themselves problematic institutions.\n\nI work in the Netherlands currently, where people have been optimizing the infrastructure for a long time, such as traffic optimization. But they think about how to optimize the infrastructure for everyone, having in-depth discussions about how to do it in a fair manner.\n\nCompanies like Waze do not officially join the infrastructure planning. They offer services to citizens that use that infrastructure, going through the backdoor, de facto redefining the social welfare function of those infrastructures. These services are putting into practice a new definition of what it means to use roads optimally. In the process, they are no longer optimizing the infrastructure for everyone, but doing so their users and their bottom line.\n\nBasically, every time we apply optimization systems to public agencies or infrastructures, we are redefining the social welfare function of these agencies, and changing the fabric of society. There\u2019s currently very little discussion about whether we want this model. Instead, we have public discussion that is overly focused on algorithms, automated decisions and data flows. Discussions about how to improve algorithms or control data flows does not address how optimization systems are changing the way in which our infrastructures should be governed, or how our resources should be allocated. \n\nThere\u2019s currently a run for AI. There\u2019s all this inevitability and urgency around it: \u201cIf we don\u2019t do AI, then China and the US will. So we need to do AI.\u201d On a cynical day, one could imagine this is a huge fraud scheme to transfer wealth from some parties to others in the name of innovation while changing our governance structures. At the same time, the academic and civil society discussion is focused on data and algorithms. But we really need to open up a discussion about what it means to use optimization systems in managing all aspects of life.\n\nThe optimization systems we look at are based on a utilitarian logic. They come with very specific economic models. We need to discuss whether this kind of utilitarian model is the only model for resource allocation. And when it is not the right model, then we need to look at what would be better? As far as I know, which is little, until the end of the 60s, economic models and social choice theory predominantly assumed we are selfish agents trying to maximize our gain, and they proposed systems that could optimize over everybody\u2019s gains. Utilitarian models have been subject to much critique. Optimization systems bring utilitarian logics back in vogue, but with the addition that they optimize resources in different domains in line with profit interests. I think in that sense, optimization systems, or machine learning, or AI propose a very specific model, and it\u2019s a very narrow model to organize allocation of resources. \n\nGiven how little attention has been paid to these issues, it is really time to move beyond data and algorithms, and to focus on the forms of governance these technologies are brining and whether they fit with our imagination of how we want to govern our societies? Currently things are the other way around: technology companies are redefining forms of governance and proposing optimization as the only way to organize resource allocation. To succeed, these companies backdoor into the world through users. They use investment money to disrupt existing markets and outrun competitors. If and when they become the last ones standing, it may be too late to have the discussion whether we want the models of life that they propose and implement.\n\n**Burning Question**\nThe push for AI is basically marketing for a financial boost for creating a computational infrastructure based on optimization systems that govern all aspects of life. Do we want this infrastructure? How can we resist it, engage it, and ensure it serves people and their environment, and not the other way around?", "created_at": "2019-11-13 17:35:38.252754", "updated_at": "2020-12-09 10:40:36.964499", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4802, "wiki": true, "reads": 10, "score": 77.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856, 5209], "is_private": false}, {"id": 78164, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 13695, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Great question.

The vast majority of page views happened in the first 18 months of OpenCare, on the Drupal platform, and are excluded from Discourse statistics.\n* I suspect the title of your post is \"SEO-friendly\".

This is partly because we are a small crowded island and could do with more houses but it is also because we have an excess of money, and it tends to accumulate in the hands of a minority.\n\nIn care, the result is that individuals and even the state find it increasingly hard to acquire care homes and they attract private equity and hedge funds who treat staff as human \"resources\" and patients as \"consumers\" of health care services, squeezing the system to extract wealth.\n\nThis is, arguably, an extreme way of presenting the situation (after all, even hedge funds have to employ managers, many of whom are very professional and caring). However the fact is that having \"owners\" who have different drivers and values from the care-givers causes a tension that too often results in quality of care taking second place to \"delivery of health services\", which is quite a different thing.\n\nA useful parallel is the struggle many communities have to create affordable housing. An interesting and succesful innovation has been the community land trust, where land is acquired by or on behalf of the community and held in trust over the long term. They make the land available for affordable housing. Separating out the ownership of the land from the occupation of the land allows people who couldn't otherwise afford to occupy the land to come in and use it, subject to the conditions set down by the trust. We imagine a similar type of structure.\n\nTo put it another way, using financial language, owning land has a different time horizon and a different risk profile\u00a0 from owning a business. A care home that separates the two can attract different sorts of capital for the two different needs, and thus more closely match the interests of the investors with the interests of the stakeholders.

Getting started on the Edgeryders website</h2>\n\nThe Edgeryders vision is for coalitions for positive change between the vast resources of society's center, with its corporations and institutions, and the ability and need for \"deep innovation\" of society's edges.\n\nShare knowledge, learn from each other and form alliances, through respectful, truth-oriented debate. That's what the edgeryders.eu platform is for, and this article explains how to use it.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1-1\">1.1. Signup and login</h3>\n\nWhen visiting edgeryders.eu (or any other of the Edgeryders Communities platforms), you find the \"Login\" and \"Signup\" buttons in the top right and the process only collects a minimum of information. See our [Privacy Policy](/terms) for details.\n\nDetailed instructions for signup, in case you encounter any problems:\n\n1. **Start from [edgeryders.eu](https://edgeryders.eu/).** \n\n2. **Click <kbd>Sign Up</kbd>** in the top right. This will bring you to https://communities.edgeryders.eu/login, our login site. You'll see an explanation about the role of that site.\n\n3. **Click <kbd>Sign Up</kbd>** on our login site. A signup form will show up.\n\n4. **Fill in the signup form.** Click <kbd>Create New Account</kbd> in the end.\n\n    You will arrive at https://communities.edgeryders.eu/u/account-created where it says:\n\n    > You\u2019re almost done! We sent an activation mail to [_user@example.com_]. Please follow the instructions in the mail to activate your account.\n    >\n    > If it doesn\u2019t arrive, check your spam folder.\n\n6. **Check your e-mails** to find the activation e-mail. It has the title \"[Edgeryders Communities] Confirm your new account\". In case you cannot find your activation e-mail:\n\n    1. Check the spam folder of your e-mail account.\n    2. Go back to https://communities.edgeryders.eu/u/account-created and click <kbd>Resend Activation Email</kbd>.\n    3. Or even click <kbd>Change Email Adress</kbd> to try with another e-mail adress.\n    4. If still nothing worked, contact an Edgeryders admin by e-mail for help. You can write to @noemi at [noemi@edgeryders.eu](mailto:noemi@edgeryders.eu) or to @matthias at [matthias@edgeryders.eu](mailto:matthias@edgeryders.eu).\n\n7. **Click the account activation link** that you found in the activation e-mail. At that link, you will find a message:\n\n    > ### Welcome to Edgeryders Communities!\n    > <kbd>Click here to activate your account</kbd>\n\n    Click that button of course.\n\n    You will now be logged in and see a welcome message to that effect.\n\n8. **Return to the platform you came from.** Just follow the corresponding link in the overview of Edgeryders Communities platforms you see. (You can find the same list in the top right \"Communities\" menu as well.)\n\n9. **Log in \u2026 again.** Back on that platform, there's one last step: click <kbd>Log In</kbd> in the top right.\n\n    No need to enter a password. You will be logged in right away, because you already logged in on the login site. The same is true if you ever choose to log in to any of the other Edgeryders Communities from the top-right \"Communities\" menu.\n\n    Also, Logins do not expire. So except you lose your notebook / phone / tablet, or re-install your browser or operating system, there is no need to ever log in again.\n\nOther details:\n\n* **Logging in to other Edgeryders Communities platforms** Your edgeryders.eu account also allows you to login on all \"Edgeryders Communities\" websites. These are similar online communities that decided to [use the Edgeryders website technology](/t/id/7419) under their own brand \u2013 see the top-right menu for a list.\n\n    After the very first login into your Edgeryders account, you are able to join each of the \"Edgeryders Communities\" with a single click: select the Edgeryders Communities platform you want to visit via the top-right menu, and click \"Login\" there. You will be logged in right away, without having to enter any password, because you are logged into your edgeryders.eu account already. You have the same username on that new platform that you have on edgeryders.eu.\n\n    This is made possible by our dedicated login website, [communities.edgeryders.eu](https://communities.edgeryders.eu/). It lives on the same server as edgeryders.eu itself, and only the edgeryders.eu admins have server access, so your account is safe.\n\n* **Logging in with an edgeryders.eu account created before July 2017.** In July 2017, we switched to a new software here on edgeryders.eu (from Drupal 7 to Discourse).\n\n    Your existing edgeryders.eu login and password keep working as they did. There is one exception: if your username contains anything that is not a Roman letter (a-z, A-Z) or a digit (0-9), better use your registered e-mail address instead of your username to log in. (You can also use your username if you change each of these non-alphanumeric characters to an underscore \"`_`\". For example, `Qu\u00edntus-Fabius Maximus` becomes `Qu_ntus_Fabius_Maximus`.)\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1-2\">1.2. Completing or changing your profile information</h3>\n\n#### Changing your profile information\n\nDue to our \"Login with Edgeryders\" mechanism (see [above](#chap-1-1)), you have to go to your user account settings on our login website [communities.edgeryders.eu](https://communities.edgeryders.eu/) if you want to change certain parts of your profile / account information.\n\nAs told in your account settings for example here on edgeryders.eu, this affects the following settings:\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/2/258c7d4b04b6cab7bb6a017c9e9bf59c645d16d4.png\" width=\"690\">\n\nAfter changing one or more of these settings on communities.edgeryders.eu, log out of the Edgeryders Communities platform (such as edgeryders.eu) and log in again to see the changes there. Please note that it can take 3-4 minutes after login until your profile picture is shown in the top right, as the system has to create a scaled-down version first, which is done in a job queue mechanism.\n\nAll other profile information is not synchronized between the different Edgeryders Communities platforms. Change it directly on these platforms. (You can also adapt it on communities.edgeryders.eu but since that platform is only for signup and login and has no content, this is not really relevant.)\n\n#### Explanation\n\nOur \"Login with Edgeryders\" mechanism allows you to use the same account identity (username, e-mail address and password) on all Edgeryders Communities platforms. This requires that, when you want to change your username, it has to change on all Edgeryders Communities platforms at the same time. We realized this function by defining that your username on communities.edgeryders.eu is the \"master version\" (since this is used for signup and login) and on every login to an Edgeryders Communities platform, the information from your \"master\" profile is taken over.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1-3\">1.3. Introduction to the platform's concepts and features</h3>\n\nThe Edgeryders platform edgeryders.eu is made from open source software \u2013 it is based on [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/), and you can download it from [our Github repository is](https://github.com/edgeryders/discourse). It will take a bit of getting used to it, but it's a very modern and user friendly solution we have now. Give it a try! As always, [get in touch](/t/id/39) if you experience any trouble.\n\nHere is an overview of the site's terminology and navigation:\n\n* **Frontpage.** When you first log in, the home page that you see is a listing of our _categories_, which is the Discourse term for \"forums\" or \"message boards\".\n\n* **Terminology.** So forums are called \"categories\". A _category_ can also have one level of _sub-categories_. Within them are _topics_ and within topics are _posts_. The first post is the one that starts the topic, the others are responses.\n\n* **Horizontal menu.** On the frontpage, you see the word <kbd>Categories</kbd> highlighted in red and other options in the same horizontal menu. These are different choices for looking at the overall content on the site. Try each one out and see which view is best for which purpose:\n\n    * **Categories.** A list of all categories and sub-categories of the site, forming the content of the frontpage.\n    * **Unread.** A list of topics with new responses, where you are participating in the discussion or get notifications from for other reasons.\n    * **New.** A list of all topics that were created since your last visit. These are topics in which you are not participating, so they did not already appear in \"Unread\". In the beginning this will be a long list because everything on the site is new to you. Close to the lower right side is a <kbd>Dismiss</kbd> button that lets you mark everything as \"seen.\" Do this and all later visits will show you what is new to you since you marked it. Very useful.\n    * **Latest.** The most complete view of all recent activity on the site, not limited to what you get notified about. Useful to see what's happening that might be interesting to join.\n\n* **Hamburger menu.** In addition, in your upper right view there is a \"hamburger menu\" of stacked horizontal lines. The hamburger menu will always be there. Use it as a one-click to navigate to other main categories and site sections when you are inside a topic.\n\nCompared to our old platform we had until July 2017, here is what changed:\n\n* **New content structure.** We moved all of the Edgeryders content so that it fits into the categories we created on our re-designed site.\n\n* **We have rolled out an ethical consent funnel**. It is a two-questions quiz that replaces the \"I agree to the terms and conditions\" box to tick. We developed it as a way to make the [OpenCare](/c/opencare) research more ethical, and are now extending it to every corner on Edgeryders. You will only have to answer it once, but until you do the platform will not let you post.\n\n* **We have updated our [Terms of Use and Privacy Policy ](/t/id/44).**\n\n* **All external links pointing to individual posts, wikis, events, pages etc. of the old platform still work**, and are now redirected to the imported content on the new one. Internal links within the edgeryders.eu platform have been adapted to point directly to the new content.\n\n* **@mentions still work,** like this: @alberto. [See below](#chap-3-2) for details.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1-4\">1.4. Why we have our own platform, and it's different</h3>\n\nWith so many people using Facebook, Twitter and other popular social networks, why don't we simply run Edgeryders from one or more of them? Why do we insist using our own platform?\n\n1. **Living tech.** The edgeryders.eu platform is designed to be \"living tech\", co-evolving with the community using it. Instead of developing it first and using it later, we started from a standard installation of an open source software package ([Discourse](https://discourse.org)), used it a bit, changed it more to how we like it, used it a bit more, changed it again and so forth. As our needs for tools to collaborate become more sophisticated, we integrate them into the platform. \n\n    As a result, we get a platform that all of us really own. You can find it, with all the changes we made, in our Github repository [edgeryders/discourse](https://github.com/edgeryders/discourse). You are welcome to install and use it yourself in any project you like, and also to pioneer new features with us. Let us hear your ideas in the [Support & Development](/c/workspaces/support) workspace (and no, you don't need to be a developer for that!).\n\n2. **No intermediation.** For example with [Spot the Future](/t/id/2470), you are talking to UNDP in a space that UNDP designs and pays for. We believe we should not need to go through corporations to talk to our own institutions.\n\n3. **Fairness.** On the Edgeryders platform, all your content remains yours. You just grant us the license to show it to others ([legal information here](/t/id/44)).\n\n4. **No commercial interest.** Mainstream social networks are for profit corporations selling contextualized advertisement. Facebook in particular constantly tweaks its code to show people content that their client pay for. They want you to look at what will make them the most money, not at what you are most interested in. We do not do that, so we can guarantee that your contribution will not be buried under status updates with energy drinks or fashion brands.\n\n5. **Access over time.** Facebook, Twitter and the others never delete content; but they do make it difficult or expensive to get over time. You can't search for tweets older than 15 days; and Facebook prefers you to look at new content. Every contribution is precious to us, and we make sure it is fully accessible and indexed by search engines over time.\n\n6. **Privacy and data protection.** Mainstream social networks use your activity to profile you as a consumer, and figure out what sort of advertising you are responding to the most. With our platform, you can choose to participate without your participation labeling you as a certain kind of individual in some massive database in the USA. Our servers are protected by [German data protection law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesdatenschutzgesetz), one of the safest in the world.\n\n7. **Inclusion.** For all these reasons, there are people in the Edgeryders community that refuse to use Facebook and Twitter, many of them hackers. We value their point of view and do not wish to exclude them.\n\n8. **Reusability for analysis.** We are not simply having a conversation here: we are collectively writing a document that encodes the views of citizens engaged in future building, social innovation, lifestyle hacking and so on. To aggregate individual opinions into a collective point of view we need analysis: to do analysis we need full access to the content. Mainstream social networks do not restrict access to our content, even if we created it.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1-5\">1.5. Netiquette</h3>\n\nEdgeryders is a precious space for interaction to its community. We are proud to have somehow managed to build a space for learning safely about uncomfortable truths; for disagreeing respectfully; for asking for and freely giving help without this implying a pecking order.\n\nThe rules governing interaction are those that you would expect when talking to people you deeply respect, and want to respect you too. Be clear and respectful. Don't be creepy. Don't be an a\u00a7\u00a7#ole. When you post something try to make it personal, do by all means link external resources but add your own reflections to them. For more details, see our page \"[Netiquette](/t/id/45)\".\n\nIf you notice unpleasant or inappropriate behaviour (read: trolling or creepiness) please alert the Edgeryders team.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1-6\">1.6. Security</h3>\n\nEdgeryders is a public platform and in that sense, not secure. Yes, we encrypt the data transferred from and to the website with SSL. We store your password in an encrypted way. We do not collect your real name and we prefer you don't tell it. But still, it's a public platform, and all its content is public, and its messages are not end-to-end encrypted.\n\nSo, don't use this platform for stuff you want to keep secret, or for content that could have serious consequences if connected to your real-world identity.\n\nFor content licencing details and our privacy policy, read the corresponding chapters in our page \"[Terms of Use and Privacy Policy](/t/id/44)\".\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1-7\">1.7. What if my written English is not that good?</h3>\n\nEdgeryders is a global community, and we take pride and joy in this diversity. We choose to communicate in English because it is the best approximation to a global language there is, but most of us are not native English speakers. If you can write in English, even a little, we encourage you to do so in the interest of increasing your potential audience, with the promise that people will focus on your ideas rather than your command of the language. No one is allowed to look down on anyone else on the grounds of spelling or grammar errors. If you are not comfortable with that, it's ok to write in your own language: chances are some of us read it, and anyway there is always machine translation.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2. Reading, posting and connecting</h2>\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-1\">2.1. Browsing through topics</h3>\n\nWhen you first visit, the home page that you see is like a table of contents of this website. You see the word <kbd>Categories</kbd> highlighted as a red button in a menu bar with other choices. This site calls the main content areas \"categories.\" A Category can also have one level of sub-categories. Within them are \"topics\" (discussion threads), and each topic consists of \"posts\" (comments).\n\nThe horizontal main menu offers you other ways of looking at the content within this site. Try each one out and see which view is best for what purpose. We ordered them left-to-right by relevance:\n\n* <kbd>**Unread**</kbd> lists all posts that you are [subscribed](#chap-2-7) to and have not ready yet.\n\n* <kbd>**New**</kbd> lists all _topics_ that you have not ready yet (whether you are subscribed to them or not). At first that means everything. On that screen, find the <kbd>Dismiss</kbd> button in the lower right to mark everything as \"seen.\" Do this and all later visits will show you what is new to you since you marked it. Very useful.\n\n* <kbd>**Latest**</kbd> lists all _posts_ that you have not ready yet (whether you are subscribed to them or not). This is the least relevant list, but after you have read all your \"Unread\" and \"New\" content you can find all other recent activity on the site from here if you want to read more. There's a helpful red line inside this list, marking the time of your last visit so you know what happened after you left.\n\n* <kbd>**Bookmarks**</kbd> lists all topics you have bookmarked yourself (by clicking the <kbd>Bookmark</kbd> button close to the bottom of a topic's page). It is a nice way to create shortcuts, for example (as a collaborator) to this [Discourse manual](/t/id/6463), our [Matrix manual](/t/id/6430) and our [Dynalist manual](/t/id/7618).\n\nIn addition, in your upper right view there is the hamburger menu **\u2630**. The hamburger menu will always be there on every page. Use it as a one-click way to navigate to any other main section of the website when you are inside a topic.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-2\">2.2. Using the search field to find stuff and people</h3>\n\nYou will find the search field on the top right <img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/3d6de014a3a1b4bb1cbe80e134052493ad80a49d.PNG\" width=\"31\" height=\"26\">.\n\nIt works as you would expect:\n\n* Click the search icon, horizontal search bar will appear, start typing and relevant result will start appear on the screen.\n\n* To filter the result you can click option link right beneath the search bar.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-3\">2.3. Creating posts</h3>\n\nCreating a good article has never been easy. But in Discourse, it is :slight_smile: On the homepage or any category page, click the \"+ New Topic\" button in the top right: <img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9ac9474e23291b9d8803021af15a9d40307134e9.PNG\" width=\"115\" height=\"31\">\n\nAn expandable text editor will pop up in the bottom of your browser window:\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a30aa730015bf1ebefffae20b69755bb80a507f5.PNG\" width=\"690\" height=\"343\">\n\nJust fill the fields in the editor form:\n\n* In the first, single-line input field, enter the title of your topic.\n* In the second, dropdown-style field, choose the category or sub-category to which your topic belongs. This defines who will be notified by e-mail about your topic, which is a big part of your potential audience. If you are not sure, choose \"Campfire\" or \"Uncategorized\" and a moderator will sort it in for you.\n* In the third text-area type field, enter your topic's main text. You can add hyperlinks, embed images by drag & drop or uploading, and format your content in several ways.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-4\">2.4. Editing existing content</h3>\n\n**Who can edit what?**\n\n* **Any signed-in user** with trust level 2 or higher can edit wikis posts, which are marked by a green pen-and-paper icon in the top right of a post. (You move from \"trust level 1\" to \"trust level 2\" automatically when you participate on this platform for a bit.)\n\n* **Authors** can always edit their own content (because that is how we configured Discourse). But please be considerate with this power so that you don't confuse readers who try to follow the discussion later.\n\n* **Platform moderators** (those marked by a shield icon behind their username) can edit everyone's content. They will do so only without changing the meaning of what you said. For example, they might fix the occasional spelling or grammar mistake (because Google likes orthography :smiley:) or improve the formatting of your content. You will be notified when that happens and can always check who changed what (see below) and if necessary complain by flagging the post.\n\n**How to edit a post?** To edit a post, you click on the three-dots menu below a post and then on the pen icon.\n\n**How to check the edit history of a post?** For everything you can edit, you can also see the edit history of who changed what, and why. Just click on the icon with the pen that you find in the top right corner of a post, and you can browse through pairwise comparisons of the post's versions. Above each version, you find you made the changes and often also a short note by that user why they made the change.\n\n&nbsp; (You can _not_ see the edit history of content you cannot edit \u2013 this is good because it allows you and our staff to hide information again that was made public by accident in a post).\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-5\">2.5. Creating comments (skillfully)</h3>\n\nMost topics on Edgeryders are commentable, and the community loves to use comments to reach out to others. Many times your comment will be part of a rich conversation. Here is how to be a skillful writer of comments:\n\n1. Decide what you are commenting on. Is it the content itself? Or are you reacting to another comment?\n\n2. If you are reacting to the original content, scroll down to the end of the comments (or to the end of the content if yours is the first comment). You will find a form to leave a comment already open. Just write the text and press \"Save\".\n\n3. If you are reacting to a comment, locate and click the link \"reply\" under the comment's text on the right. Your comment will display at the end of the discussion but with a link to the comment you are responding to. This helps other edgeryders to make sense of the conversation.\n\n4. You will make it easier for other edgeryders to engage in conversation with you if you make it clear, in the text, who is it you are talking to. Example: \"I agree with you, Alice. Your remarks, combined with Bob's, made me think that...\"\n\nWhen you create a comment, the following people are notified: the author of the original content; anybody who left a comment to the same content before you; and everyone else who follows the topic or one of its categories or tags.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-6\">2.6. Mentions</h3>\n\n**What are mentions?** Like many popular social media platforms, this platform supports **mentioning** other users with an **@** tag. If you want to involve another community member in the conversation you are in, you can \"ping\" her using mentions. As a result, that user will get a notification on the platform and, if needed, also by e-mail; the notification will contain a link to the conversation to join.\n\n**How to @mention.** Mentions work much like on Twitter: type the \"at\" symbol **@** followed by a username. If you type at least two letters after the \"at\" symbol, you will see some suggestions for usernames that begin with that combination of letters. Choose among them the name of the user you want to mention, as in the image below:\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f673b482e2cc54be61bf6f0451210edb556ad328.PNG\" width=\"690\">\n\nYou can use mentions almost anywhere on the edgeryders.eu platform. Usernames are case-insensitive, so @edgeryders and @Edgeryders and @EDGERYDERS will all have the same result. When the mention is shown with a gray background after saving your post, it worked and the notification was sent. If it is shown just as regular text, it did not work \u2013 try to find your mistake in writing that username.\n\n**@mentions across Edgeryders Communities platforms.** Currently, you can only mention a user who has an account on the _same_ Edgeryders Communities platform (for example, on edgeryders.eu). If the username is not proposed in the @mention auto-completion list, the user does not have such an account. You can also confirm this in the User Directory, for example [here](/u) for edgeryders.eu.\n\nBut what if you _want_ to mention such a user? Send them a message or mention them on an Edgeryders Communities platform where they _do have_ an account.\n\n[details=More details]More details: You can not send messages on communities.edgeryders.eu as this site is really only for logins. But normally every user also has accounts on at least one Edgeryders Communities platform because that's where they came from to sign up. The reason why we don't create every account on every Edgeryders Communities platform at signup time is to avoid amassing inactive accounts and to not confuse users when they receive notifications from websites where they never actively logged in. Anyway, in the future we will improve these mechanisms for cross-platform user interaction.[/details]\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-7\">2.7. Adjusting your on-platform notifications</h3>\n\nIt is really empowering for you who are registered on the platform to control just *how much* you wish to be kept up to date and in the loop!\n\nDiscourse is great at remembering what you wrote or where you left off, and at taking you there. For example, the system lets you know immediately when anyone replied to you or liked something you said \u2013 on your profile picture icon in the upper right side of the webpage:\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/62d21767ab4261bb13f5075da0e5fde8429bbace.PNG\" width=\"690\" height=\"228\">\n\nClicking on a notification takes you exactly to the section of the topic relevant to you:\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/2/278d68d2aa27504a0cf7fe5c0a16ca9fbffa43b1.PNG\" width=\"690\" height=\"271\">\n\nThe most important part about notifications is that they are based on what content you subscribe to. \n\nYou can manage your subscriptions anytime on the pages of topics (\"threads\"), tags and categories. To do so, find the dropdown with a circular icon at the bottom of a topic's page, or in the right top of a category or tag page. Then adjust this dropdown as follows:\n\n* <img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/3333889a266643c6278b9b6922b37c3217123811.PNG\" width=\"101\" height=\"34\"> You are ignoring all notifications from this topic.\n* <img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5158ab51c91cceb43b25ef99f5165275c1f620a2.PNG\" width=\"101\" height=\"34\"> You will be notified in your [Unread](/unread) section and in summary e-mails if someone mentions your @name or replies to you.\n* <img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/1/11fcc9e23a25b84a334ef4020be4b87af3120072.PNG\" width=\"101\" height=\"34\"> You will be notified in your [Unread](/unread) section and in summary e-mails of every new reply in this topic.\n* <img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/61f7a522f6a0566ecc9a50990992f0a0519ad6dd.PNG\" width=\"101\" height=\"33\"> Like \"Tracking\", but you receive the e-mail notifications about new replies in this topic immediately (but at earliest 10 minutes after your last visit to the website, and not if you are currently visiting the website).\n\nThere are also global settings affecting notifications. You can adapt them by going, from the top right of the site, to \"user icon menu \u2192 :gear: \u2192 Notifications\":\n\n* **Desktop Notifications.** To receive notifications about new activity in your browser. You have to adapt this setting in every browser you use separately.\n\n* **Users.** You can also suppress all notifications from selected users in by listing them in the \"Muted\" field.\n\nIf you want to understand the Discourse notification mechanism in more detail, look into our [Discourse Administration Manual section \"5. Understanding notifications\"](https://edgeryders.eu/t/-/6647#heading--5).\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-8\">2.8. Adjusting your e-mail notifications</h3>\n\nYou might be annoyed by getting too many e-mails. This is what you can do: \n\n\n#### If you don't want e-mails about certain content\n\nTo not be notified about certain kinds of content, adjust your notification settings accordingly. To do so, find the dropdown with a circular icon at the bottom of a topic's page, or in the right top of a category or tag page, and adjust it as follows:\n\n* **For topics.** Set the notification level to \"normal\" to be notified about mentions and replies in activity summary e-mails. Set it to \"muted\" to never be notified about this topic.\n\n* **For categories.** Set the notification level to \"muted\" to never see topics from this category included in your activity summary e-mails about new topics. This helps to get rid of notifications from categories that exist for technical reasons, with no discussions in them, for example for our system of hosting web content inside Discourse. We muted these categories for everyone already, but might forget to do so if new categories of this type are added. You can always see a summary of your category notification settings under \"Preferences \u2192 Notifications \u2192 Categories\" in your user profile.\n\n* **For tags.** It is possible to mute tags, preventing new topics with this tag from appearing in your activity summary e-mails. However, since we do not apply tags very consistently, this is not particularly useful.\n\n\n#### If you want fewer but longer e-mails in general\n\nGo to \"top-right user icon menu \u2192 :gear: \u2192 Emails\" and adapt the settings as needed:\n\n* **Replies.** You can change your replies preferences as desired.\n\n* **Activity Summary.** When you don't visit here, you will be sent a summary e-mail of topics and replies that you are interested. Specifically, this covers any new items in your [Unread](/unread) section, which is based on the topics, categories and tags you are subscribed to. These e-mails will only come if there is anything new, and you don't have edgeryders.eu open in a browser tab anyway. You can choose if to include content from new users in these summary emails, and you can adjust their frequency:\n\n    * Every 30 minutes\n    * Hourly\n    * Daily\n    * Every three days\n    * Every week\n    * Every two weeks\n\n* **Mailing list mode.** Enable mailing list mode overrides the activity selection. Muted topics and categories are not included in these emails.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-9\">2.9. Reaching out through messages</h3>\n\nAnother way to reach out, this time on a one-to-one basis, is to send them a message. Look through the [user directory](/u) and click on the name of the person you are looking for; you can do the same anywhere else where that username is shown, including in @mentions.\n\nNow, a small popup will appear like below:\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/d/d009670427d47eaf905cbbcc4d85a17d43975c1d.PNG\" width=\"681\" height=\"235\">\n\nClick on the <kbd>Message</kbd> button to compose your message; this messaging system allows us to contact each other in a private channel even if you do not know each other's email address.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-10\">2.10. Interacting with other users outside of this platform</h3>\n\nWe encourage all edgeryders to keep as much as possible of their interaction within this platform. It's free, open, and self-hosted: the community has complete control over the database. However, some projects just need other kinds of tools.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--3\">3. Creating advanced content</h2>\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-1\">3.1. Formatting text content</h3>\n\nFor details about content formatting and a reference of all ways to do this, please refer to our detailed documentation topic:\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/formatting-text-content/6761\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-2\">3.2. Structuring long or complex content</h3>\n\nWith the Discourse text editor and limited formatting options, it can be challenging to write or edit long and complex texts. Here are our best practices that emerged to deal with this:\n\n**Content that fits into one topic.** If your content is around 10 screen pages or less, it fits well into a single, structured topic:\n\n1. **Put all your content into the first post of a topic.** The posts below that should be limited to discussion comments.\n2. **Create numbered chapters and sub-chapters.** Use the \"1. \u2013 1.1. \u2013 1.2. \u2013 2. \u2013 2.1.\" etc. numbering format. Start with heading level H2 for the first level of chapters (`## 1. Chapter Title` in Markdown), because the Discourse editor also starts with that heading level.\n3. **Add a table of contents.** (see [below](#heading--2-6)).\n\n**Content that does not fit into one topic.** If your content is longer than around 10 screen pages, or requires more than two levels in the table of contents (means chapters like \"1.2.3.\"), better split the content across multiple topics as follows. Overall, this is much more navigable (and editable) than trying to cramp all content into one topic. In addition, this technique is useful to move some parts of the content out of a public topic into access restricted categories, where necessary.\n\n1. **Create an index document.** Again with chapters, sub-chapters and a table of contents. Some (sub-)chapters might contain content, others would only contain a (one-sentence or more detailed) summary and link to a different topic with the actual content.\n\n2. **Make the index document a pinned topic in its category.** Usually, not always \u2013 only if the topic is important / central enough to be pinned.\n\n3. **Write sub-topics.** These are normal topics with detailed content. Structure the subject matter there as normally for \"content that fits into one topic\" (see on that above). Especially, start the chapter numbering and level from \"1.\", since each of these is an independent topic and they are just referenced from the index topic.\n\n4. **Add a sub-topic note.** In the topics with the detailed content, add a note to the top like this:\n\n    > _This topic is a linked part of a larger work: \"&lt;[Linked title of index topic](http://example.com/)&gt;_\"\n\n    After that note, there should be a gap to the rest of the content to emphasize it visually. A following heading (`## Content` etc.) will provide that. If no heading follows, create a line containing `&nbsp;` instead to provide this.\n\n5. **Tag the sub-topic.** We use tag `subtopic` to indicate its special role. This is meant to hint users to this in topic lists and when they start reading past a topic's title. The tag provides a [list of all sub-topics](/tags/subtopic), but this is more a side-effect here.\n\nFor examples of this technique, see various sections in this user manual document:\n\n* \"[Formatting your content](#heading-3-1)\"\n* \"[Adding a table of contents](#heading-4-5)\"\n* \"[Writing in Arabic and other right-to-left scripts (RTL)](#heading-3-4)\"\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-3\">3.3. Adding tables</h3>\n\nTables in Discourse can be written in HTML, [in Markdown](https://meta.discourse.org/t/66544) or in pure text. (Markdown tables did not work in some earlier Discourse versions, though.) Note that text tables are not responsive (so might be too wide for mobile users), need a fixed-width font, and do not allow further formatting inside the table. However, they might be useful for special cases where copy & pasting a table as plain text is desirable.\n\nExample of a Markdown table:\n\n```markdown\n| Col A | Col B | Col C   |\n|-------|-------|---------|\n| A1    | B1    | C1      |\n| A2    | B2    | :smile: |\n```\n\nResult:\n\n| Col A | Col B | Col C   |\n|-------|-------|---------|\n| A1    | B1    | C1      |\n| A2    | B2    | :smile: |\n\n**Tips and tricks:**\n\n* **Copy & paste as Markdown tables.** Discourse has an (experimental) feature that converts HTML to Markdown when copy & pasting it into the Discourse editor. When copying a HTML table in the browser, the browser will also convert it internally to a plain-text format called \"tab separated values\" (TSV). You can also create such a format yourself in a text editor. In any case, pasting two or more lines of TSV text into the Discourse editor automatically converts it to table in Markdown syntax.\n\n* **Formatting in HTML tables.** When creating HTML tables in Discourse, further markup inside the table can only be in HTML. (This seems to be a bug, as Markdown allows to mix with HTML freely.)\n\n* **Tables in lists.** All three types of tables can become part of multi-level lists. See [details and an example](/t/6761#heading--4-3).\n\n* **Tables Generator.** You can of course write the table code manually, but there's a nice tool that can help you generate all three table types: [Tables Generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/).\n\n* **Import in Tables Generator.** You can use the various import functions in [Tables Generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/) to comfortably edit tables from an existing Discourse post (a wiki, your own post, or a post you're fixing as an admin):\n\n    * **Markdown tables.** Copy the Markdown code copied the Discourse post editor and paste it at \"File \u2192 Paste table data \u2026\". Markdown text formatting inside cells is shown as Markdown source code and can be edited that way.\n\n    * **HTML tables.** There is no direct way, but you can use the browser's conversion to tab separated values: copy the rendered table from the browser and paste it at \"File \u2192 Paste table data \u2026\". This will lose formatting of text in the table. To avoid that, better use Markdown tables.\n\n  * **TablesGenerator JSON tables.** TablesGenerator has its osn JSON based format \"TGN\", allowing to preserve really all of the table formatting. Use \"File \u2192 Save table \u2026\" to save as a TGN file, and \"File \u2192 Load table \u2026\" to load it again. You can attach that file to a Discourse post by uploading it like an image. For wikis with complex tables, this is a good way to allow others to edit the tables comfortably. (To use this technique on another Discourse site, an admin needs to add `tgn` in setting \"authorized extensions\" first.)\n\n* **Good looking text tables.** When creating text tables with [Tables Generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/), you can enable \"Use Unicode symbols for table borders\". It will look much nicer, especially if you use the technique from \"[Adding simple graphics with box drawing characters](#heading--2-18)\" to insert them without gaps between lines of text. That works by enclosing it in a code block like this:\n\n      ```semigraphics\n      this is a code block for tables\n      ```\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-4\">3.4. Adding videos, maps and other embedded content</h3>\n\nDiscourse does not allow to embed external content by using `<iframe>` HTML elements in your topics, and the reason for that is mostly to be more secure against external content that could exploit security vulnerabilities in a visitor's browser.\n\nHowever, it has its own mechanism for embedding content, called \"Onebox\". You may know it from WordPress blogs already: post a URL to a video, map or other content on its own line, with no whitespace before the URL, and the URL will automatically be turned into embedded content.\n\nThe following is an (incomplete list) of Onebox embeddings that result in embedded content:\n\n* Google Maps links\n* YouTube links to individual videos\n* Vimeo links to individual videos\n* Twitter tweets\n* publicly accessible Google Docs documents (to be confirmed)\n* other URLs with a whitelisted domain that provides oEmbed metadata of type `rich` and with an `<iframe>` element inside ([source](https://github.com/discourse/onebox#whitelisted-generic-onebox-caveats))\n\nThe following is a list of Onebox embeddings that result in a small link preview box with an image and text:\n\n* URLs handled in special ways by the Discourse [onebox gem library](https://github.com/discourse/onebox#whitelisted-generic-onebox-caveats) if they do not result in embedded content. See the [full list](https://github.com/discourse/onebox/tree/master/templates).\n* Other URLs with a whitelisted domain that provide oEmbed metadata but not of type `rich` ([source](https://github.com/discourse/onebox#whitelisted-generic-onebox-caveats)).\n\nAs you see, the linked domain has to be whitelisted for this to work, and if it does not provide its own `<iframe>` element, special code has to be added to Discourse to embed a content element instead of showing just a link preview. For this reason, PDF files cannot be embedded so far.\n\nHowever, if you have a real demand to embed content from a certain domain (esp. a regular demand for that), you can ask in the [Support & Development](https://edgeryders.eu/c/workspaces/support) category that we add Onebox support for these URLs.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-5\">3.5. Adding images</h3>\n\n#### Using Markdown\n\nThe standard syntax and our convention for inserting images is to use the code produced by the editor's \"Upload\" button.\n\nExample:\n\n    ![CC-BY logo|88x31](upload://q7MC9yJNpYqjfS68RId87oHKzUE.png)\n\nResult:\n\n![CC-BY logo|88x31](upload://q7MC9yJNpYqjfS68RId87oHKzUE.png)\n\nFor the link, you can use:\n\n* The `upload://` URL scheme used by Discourse when uploading images\n* A relative URL such as `/uploads/default/original/2X/6/621\u2026.jpg`.\n* A full URL such as `https://example.com/a.png`. Be sure to only use HTTPS URLs as this platform is HTTPS-only, so browsers may not load imaged embedded via an unencrypted HTTP connection.\n\nJust as with Markdown hyperlinks, it is possible to reference URLs with short identifiers and then list the actual URLs in a list further down. Identifiers can be numerical, but don't have to be.\n\nExample:\n\n    ![CC-BY logo|88x31][logo1]\n\n    [logo1]: upload://q7MC9yJNpYqjfS68RId87oHKzUE.png\n\nResult:\n\n![CC-BY logo|88x31][logo1]\n\n[logo1]: upload://q7MC9yJNpYqjfS68RId87oHKzUE.png\n\n\n#### Using Markdown: Scaling\n\nIt is possible to configure how large the image embedded in the Discourse post will be displayed. This does not change the uploaded image, which is still visible in its full size when clicking on it (for uploaded images larger than 690\u00d7690 px in our installation, as smaller ones do not get provided an option to click on them as they would usually fit in full into the post). The syntax is [according to here](https://meta.discourse.org/t/66812):\n\nExample:\n\n    ![CC-BY logo|88x31,50%](upload://q7MC9yJNpYqjfS68RId87oHKzUE.png)\n\nResult:\n\n![CC-BY logo|88x31,50%](upload://q7MC9yJNpYqjfS68RId87oHKzUE.png)\n\nAdmissible values are 1-100%. This will scale the image down proportionally to the given percentage size, from its original size or from the maximum thumbnail boundary dimensions of 690\u00d7690 px, whichever is smaller. Sometimes this behavior is not flexible enough. You can then change the `[width]x[height]` display size in the Markdown element to achieve sizes >100%, non-proportional scaling, 1x1 px hidden images and other effects.\n\nExample:\n\n    ![CC-BY logo|176x62](upload://q7MC9yJNpYqjfS68RId87oHKzUE.png)\n\nResult:\n\n![CC-BY logo|176x62](upload://q7MC9yJNpYqjfS68RId87oHKzUE.png)\n\n\n#### Using HTML\n\nEarlier versions of Discourse used the `<img src=\"\u2026\"/>` HTML syntax to insert images. This still works, but requires you to give a relative or absolute URL of the image file. The `upload://\u2026` URL scheme does not work here.\n\nExample:\n\n    <img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/621\u2026.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Test Alt Text\" title=\"Test Title\"/>\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6218d50608595a107c07c35a12979966a620d433.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Test Alt Text\" title=\"Test Title\"/>\n\nThe main advantage of the HTML syntax is that it allows to set the image title manually.  It will be displayed in a tooltip overlay when mousing over the image. Titles can be long (whole paragraphs) but cannot contain formatting. Still, this can for example be useful for a somewhat interactive graphic, made from several pieces / image tiles.\n\nIn the Markdown and BBCode syntax however, the image title is always initialized from the upload filename, cannot be overwritten or changed, and will only be displayed for images that can be enlarged (means, upload size exceeds the bounding box of 690\u00d7690 px).\n\n\n#### Using HTML: Scaling\n\nYou can use the `width=\"\u2026\"` and `height=\"\u2026\"` attributes to scale the image. All values are interpreted as pixel values. Scaling to a size larger than the content width is not possible \u2013 the maximum size with an effect is 690\u00d7690 px. Non-proportional scaling is possible. When you give only one value, the other is calculated so that scaling is proportional.\n\nExample:\n\n    <img src='/uploads/default/original/2X/6/621\u2026.jpg' width=\"100\" alt=\"Image\" />\n\n<img src='/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6218d50608595a107c07c35a12979966a620d433.jpg' width=\"100\" />\n\n\n#### Using BBCode\n\nFor completeness: BBCode provides a tag to embed images. None of the [BBCode img options](https://www.bbcode.org/examples/?id=10) are interpreted. Using it requires you to give a relative or absolute URL of the image file. The `upload://\u2026` URL scheme does not work here.\n\nExample:\n\n```text\n[img]/uploads/default/original/2X/6/621\u2026.jpg[/img]\n```\n\nResult: \n\n[img]/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6218d50608595a107c07c35a12979966a620d433.jpg[/img]\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-6\">3.6. Adding simple graphics with box drawing characters</h3>\n\nThis is a bit of a rare and weird use case \u2013 but if you want to draw some simple shapes to explain something and don't want to go through the hassle of starting your drawing program, drawing, exporting and uploading the file, this can be a quick and effective solution. Also, it allows others to modify the drawing right inside Discourse (for example in a wiki), without needing an external program and without needing to ask you for access to your original file.\n\n\n#### Setup\n\nBefore anyone can use the instructions below, a Discourse administrator has to do the following steps:\n\n1. Create an entry `semigraphics` in the [\"highlighted languages\" setting](/admin/site_settings/category/all_results?filter=highlighted%20languages) of the Discourse admin backend.\n\n    This is not supported by the [HighlightJS](https://highlightjs.org/) library that Discourse employs but will still result in `<code class=\"lang-semigraphics\">\u2026</code>` markup to which we can apply the necessary styling below.\n\n2. Add the following CSS snippet under \"\u2630 \u2192 Admin \u2192 Customize \u2192 Themes \u2192 (choose theme) \u2192 Common \u2192 CSS\". This keeps the usual line gap for all code formatting except our `semigraphics` style, where gaps between lines would make box drawing characters look ugly.\n\n    ```css\n    body pre {\n        line-height: 100%;\n    }\n    pre code {\n        line-height: 1.4;\n    }\n    pre code.lang-semigraphics {\n        line-height: 100%;\n    }\n    ```\n\n#### Usage\n\n1. Go to [diiagrams.com](http://diiagrams.com/) and draw something.\n\n    If you want a drawing that is part of an indented list in Discourse, you need to leave some text columns empty to the left: 4 for each list level to indent.\n\n2. Click on `Unicode`.\n\n3. In the window that appears, click `[Copy]`.\n\n4. Paste the drawing at the right position into your Discourse editor.\n\n5. Surround your drawing with code fences markup (if needed indented to the right list level) and indicate `semigraphics` as the highlight language. It will then show properly in the editor preview. Example code:\n\n       ```semigraphics\n       \u250c\u252c\u2510\n       \u251c\u253c\u2524\n       \u2514\u2534\u2518\n       ```\n\n6. Since the usage of Unicode box drawing characters is not perfect in this tool, you may need to do some manual postprocessing by replacing some characters with more suitable ones. It is easiest to find the right character in an example shown below.\n\n\n#### Box drawing examples\n\n```semigraphics\n\u250c\u252c\u2510 \u2553\u2565\u2556  \u250c\u252c\u2510 \u250e\u2530\u2512\n\u251c\u253c\u2524\u2500\u255f\u256b\u2562  \u251c\u253c\u2524\u2500\u2520\u2542\u2528\n\u2514\u2534\u2518 \u2559\u2568\u255c  \u2514\u2534\u2518 \u2516\u2538\u251a\n \u2502   \u2551    \u2502   \u2503 \n\u2552\u2564\u2555 \u2554\u2566\u2557  \u250d\u252f\u2511 \u250f\u2533\u2513\n\u255e\u256a\u2561\u2550\u2560\u256c\u2563  \u251d\u253f\u2525\u2501\u2523\u254b\u252b\n\u2558\u2567\u255b \u255a\u2569\u255d  \u2515\u2537\u2519 \u2517\u253b\u251b\n\n\u2554\u2550\u2550\u2566\u2550\u2550\u2557  \u250c\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2510  \u256d\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u256e  \u256d\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2551\u250c\u2500\u2568\u2500\u2510\u2551  \u2502\u2554\u2550\u2567\u2550\u2557\u2502  \u2502\u2552\u2550\u256a\u2550\u2555\u2502  \u2502\u2553\u2500\u2541\u2500\u2556\u2502\n\u2551\u2502   \u2502\u2551  \u2502\u2551   \u2551\u2502  \u2502\u2502 \u2502 \u2502\u2502  \u2502\u2551 \u2503 \u2551\u2502\n\u2560\u2561   \u255e\u2563  \u251c\u2562   \u255f\u2524  \u251c\u253c\u2500\u253c\u2500\u253c\u2524  \u251c\u256b\u2500\u2542\u2500\u256b\u2524\n\u2551\u2502   \u2502\u2551  \u2502\u2551   \u2551\u2502  \u2502\u2502 \u2502 \u2502\u2502  \u2502\u2551 \u2503 \u2551\u2502\n\u2551\u2514\u2500\u2565\u2500\u2518\u2551  \u2502\u255a\u2550\u2564\u2550\u255d\u2502  \u2502\u2558\u2550\u256a\u2550\u255b\u2502  \u2502\u2559\u2500\u2540\u2500\u255c\u2502\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2569\u2550\u2550\u255d  \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2534\u2500\u2500\u2518  \u2570\u2500\u2500\u2534\u2500\u2500\u256f  \u2570\u2500\u2500\u2534\u2500\u2500\u256f\n\n\u256d\u2577\u256e  \u2543\u2540\u2544  \u2546\u2548\u2545   \u2502\u254e\u2506\u250a \u2503\u254f\u2507\u250b\n\u2576\u253c\u2574  \u253d\u253c\u253e  \u254a\u254b\u2549   \u2502\u254e\u2506\u250a \u2503\u254f\u2507\u250b\n\u2570\u2575\u256f  \u2545\u2541\u2546  \u2544\u2547\u2543   \u2502\u254e\u2506\u250a \u2503\u254f\u2507\u250b\n\n\u250f\u257b\u2513 \u250c\u257d\u2510  \u251f\u2532\u2531\u2527   \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\n\u257a\u254b\u2578 \u257c\u254b\u257e  \u251e\u253a\u2539\u2526   \u254c\u254c\u254c\u254c \u254d\u254d\u254d\u254d\n\u2517\u2579\u251b \u2514\u257f\u2518  \u2522\u252d\u252e\u252a   \u2504\u2504\u2504\u2504 \u2505\u2505\u2505\u2505\n         \u2521\u2535\u2536\u2529   \u2509\u2509\u2509\u2509 \u2509\u2509\u2509\u2509\n\n\u2588               \u2572\u2502\u2571\n\u2589  \u2571\u2572\u2571\u2572\u2573\u2573\u2573      \u2500\u2573\u2500\n\u258a  \u2572\u2571\u2572\u2571\u2573\u2573\u2573      \u2571\u2502\u2572\n\u258b  \u2571\u2572\u2571\u2572\u2573\u2573\u2573\n\u258c  \u2572\u2571\u2572\u2571\u2573\u2573\u2573      \u2591\u2591\u2592\u2592\u2593\u2593\u2588\u2588\n\u258d               \u2591\u2591\u2592\u2592\u2593\u2593\u2588\u2588\n\u258e \u2581\u2582\u2583\u2584\u2585\u2586\u2587\u2588\n\u258f\n```\n\nSource: extracted from \"[UTF-8 encoded sample plain-text file](http://www.ict.griffith.edu.au/anthony/info/data/utf8-demo.txt)\".\n\n\n#### Notes and future improvements\n\nWays to extend the above <code>```semigraphics</code> mechanism include:\n\n* similar highlighting styles with different CSS formatting applied, for example `semigraphics-red` would allow to create big colorful elements in the text to draw attention\n\nThe diigrams.com tool we use above was written by Martin Buck. He provides a [description](http://buckmartin.de/projects/diiagrams.html) and [discussed it](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/7ke6o5). The tool is not open source software, though.\n\nIf we want an open source tool for the same purpose, the options are:\n\n* **[textik.com](https://textik.com/):** Great user interface incl. resizing, moving, connectors etc.. It renders as plain ASCII boxes, but since [it is open source](https://github.com/astashov/tixi) it could be easily adapted to generate Unicode box drawing characters instead ([here](https://github.com/astashov/tixi/blob/master/resources/public/js/drawer.js)).\n\n* **[js-boxdrawing](http://marklodato.github.io/js-boxdrawing/):** You can use it right in that online demo, or [install it from Github](http://github.com/MarkLodato/js-boxdrawing). Drawing happens with arrow keys, which is nice in some cases and not nice in others.\n\n* **[aa2u](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/ascii-art-to-unicode-0.1.0.1):** A small tool that can convert ASCII art drawings (as created by textik.com and many other tools) to those using Unicode box drawing characters. But bit difficult to install as no package is provided.\n\n* **[svgbob](https://github.com/ivanceras/svgbob):** If we'd want to modify Discourse a bit, we could let the ASCII diagrams be converted to SVGs (or from there to PNGs) when saving the post, using this tool. It supports Unicode box drawing characters, and also ASCII box drawing. Due to that, users could create their drawings using any of the other tools that output ASCII. (Of course users could also use svgbob locally, but why \u2013 the workflow is then the same as for a real drawing software.)\n\n* **[ditaa](http://ditaa.sourceforge.net/):** similar to svgbob but also allows to create diagrams, even with colors.\n\nThere are many more options that are either not open source or only create ASCII based output. For an overview, [see here](https://unix.stackexchange.com/q/126630).\n\nYou can find a lot more, detailed tips and tricks about using box drawing characters and other Unicode features here:\n\n* [UTF-8 encoded sample plain-text file](http://www.ict.griffith.edu.au/anthony/info/data/utf8-demo.txt)\n\n* [Block Elements](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco/wiki/Block_Elements.html) (provides things not in the examples above)\n\n* [Using pseudographics in blogposts: drawing ASCII diagrams and boxes](https://clubmate.fi/using-pseudographics-in-blogposts-drawing-ascii-diagrams-and-boxes/)\n\n* [Taag](http://patorjk.com/software/taag), a converter from normal text to ASCII art font. Quite funny.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-7\">3.7. Adding a collaborative drawing</h3>\n\n#### For vector oriented drawings\n\n1. **Create a new drawing in Google Draw.**\n\n2. **Make the drawing publicly editable.** Or otherwise share it with the Google accounts of people who should have access.\n\n3. **Get a public URL for your drawing from Google Draw.** This is somehow in the options. You will be able to choose the size of your drawing. Here, it can be useful to choose a size larger than the 690\u00d7690 px size that is visible by default in Discourse posts. Because when clicking on the image, a fullscreen version will be shown, and when clicking on that version again, a version in 100% scaling will be shown.\n\n4. **Embed the image in your Discourse post.** In the Discourse editor, click the \"Upload\" button, then choose \"From the web\" and paste your drawing's public URL.\n\n5. **Add a paragraph with instructions below the image.** For example:\n\n    > Please contribute edits to this drawing as needed. Access the editable version [link] and make your changes. The embedded version above is updated automatically: reload this page and you should see your changes immediately.\n\n6. **Make the post a wiki.** This makes it more recognizable that this post contains content that is open to be edited by everyone. See section \"2.13. Creating a wiki\" for instructions.\n\n\n#### For raster graphics drawings\n\n[TODO]\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-8\">3.8. Adding slides</h3>\n\nSee this topic for detailed instructions:\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/adding-a-presentation-or-images-as-slides/7354\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-9\">3.9. Adding file attachments</h3>\n\nYou can add file attachments just like images in the Discourse editor by using the \"Upload\" button in its toolbar. Any file that is not recognized as an image will be rendered as an attached file that can be downloaded. Example:\n\n<a class=\"attachment\" href=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/2/2c1c80e366c62915b8aa4a5eb9a1a878c4ee3134.txt\">example.txt</a> (25 Bytes)\n \nIn addition, the filename has to match one of the allowed extensions for non-image files, which are currently:\n\n* `.pdf`\n* `.txt`\n* `.json`\n* `.tgn`\n* `.html`\n\nIf you have a reason for uploading file attachments with a different extension, you can ask a Discourse admin to add the new extension in setting \"authorized extensions\".\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-10\">3.10. Hiding details and editorial comments</h3>\n\nThis is treated in its own topic here: \"[Hiding details and editorial comments](/t/id/9573)\"\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-11\">3.11. Writing in Arabic and other right-to-left scripts (RTL)</h3>\n\nFor writing in RTL script when creating a post in the Discourse editor, first configure the writing direction for the editor textbox (if not already the default for you). For that, right-click into the editor's left textbox and choose \"Writing Direction \u2192 Right to Left\" (tested in Chrome, will be similar in other browsers).\n\nThat step will however only show right-to-left text properly in the editor, not in the preview on its right side or the final rendering after saving. To fix that, use the text direction tag around your text in the editor. Before you start writing, simply click the \"right-aligned lines\" in the editor's toolbar to create a `[text-direction=rtl] \u2026 [/text-direction]` tag, and write your content inside.\n\nPut one blank line above and below the opening `[text-direction=rtl]` to keep Markdown formatting before and inside working (until we can fix these issues, [#91](https://github.com/edgeryders/discourse/issues/91) and [#92](https://github.com/edgeryders/discourse/issues/92)).\n\nFor more detailed instructions, refer to [Writing in Arabic and other right-to-left scripts (RTL)](/t/id/6511).\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-12\">3.12. Creating content from existing documents</h3>\n\nDiscourse accepts Markdown, BBCode and (some) HTML for text formatting in its editor ([details](/t/6761)). By convention, we exclusively use Markdown on our platform, with HTML where no Markdown equivalent is available (for example for `<kbd></kbd>`).\n\nSo if you have a document in (for example) Microsoft Word format, you have to convert it to Markdown first and then you copy&paste the result into the Discourse editor. As a final step, usually some manual postprocessing will be needed.\n\nFor conversion, here are some tips:\n\n* Under Linux, from Microsoft Word:\n\n        pandoc file.docx -f docx -t markdown --toc --wrap=none -o file.md\n\n* Under Linux, from LibreOffice Writer:\n\n        pandoc file.odt -f odt -t markdown --toc --wrap=none -o file.md\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-13\">3.13. Creating content with custom formatting</h3>\n\nDiscourse provides a very limited set of content formatting options, in order to keep a uniform and clean look and to prevent exploits of security vulnerabilities in the browser.\n\nHowever, sometimes these options are just not sufficient. For these cases, you can format your content as a PDF or HTML document and upload this document just like an image \u2013 see [3.9. Adding file attachments](#heading--3-9).\n\nThe document will then appear as a linked attachment in your post, and a user clicking on it will see it rendered in the browser. So the file is _not_ offered for download \u2013 but of course the user can still do that via \"Save as \u2026\" from the context menu.\n\nIn such a document, you have a full browser window and can display anything you want, the way you want. For TML documents for example, that includes:\n\n* custom CSS formatting\n* embedded JavaScript widgets such as calculators\n* embedded images in the HTML file (using base64 encoding)\n* images uploaded to the Discourse site as normal and then referenced in an `<img \u2026>` tag (but also show these images in your Discourse post itself, otherwise Discourse would delete them as seemingly orphaned images if setting \"clean up uploads\" is enabled)\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--4\">4. Organizing content</h2>\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-1\">4.1. Using categories</h3>\n\nEach topic on this platform is first sorted into exactly one category. You can see an overview of all our categories on [our frontpage](/categories).\n\nCategories are meant to group topics together in a basic way. Think of these as broad themes that we talk about here. Or as the table of contents of this whole website \u2013 indeed, our frontpage even looks like that.\n\nCategories are there to help website visitors find the content they are looking for. They come as a two-level hierarchy: main categories (broad themes), of which each can contain sub-categories (narrower themes). Each category or sub-category can contain any number of topics (texts created by the community members on this website).\n\nOf course you can subscribe to a category to get notified when new content is added to it. Refer to section \"[Notifications and Subscription](#notification-and-subscription)\" for detailed instructions.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-2\">4.2. Using tags</h3>\n\nEach topic on this platform is sorted into a category \u2013 however, this is quite a broad classification, and each topic can only be sorted into one category each. So, there is another way to categorize: tags.\n\nIn general, you don't have to assign any tag to topics you create, except you are a moderator on this site. But you can use the [list of existing tags](/tags) to navigate better on this website: when visiting any tag from there that interests you, you will see a list of all topics tagged that way. Also, in the right top of such a page you will see a dropdown showing a circle icon. This allows you to subscribe to the tag in various ways, so that you are automatically notified when content is added with this tag. For example, you could subscribe to our #call-for-applications::tag tag, which we use when we have an offer for a paid job, for fellowships and the like.\n\nAfter you subscribed to multiple tags, you may not remember to which ones. In that case, look at the overview that you find in your user avatar menu under \":gear: \u2192 Notifications \u2192 Tags\". It looks like this:\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/af12e8be021667fc365570020a3d472f8b6ae558.PNG\" width=\"690\" height=\"503\">\n\nFor a bit of orientation, here are the types of tags we defined and use on this platform:\n\n* **`cat2-*`:** A tag encoding the \"dimensions of well-being\" as a secondary category. Links to the topic lists for all these tags are provided on the page \"[Community \u2192 What we care about](/t/id/6978)\".\n* **`blog`:** Topics that appear on the blog of the Edgeryders company (see \"[Company \u2192 Official Blog](/tags/blog?view=topic-preview)\" in the menu). Any outstanding and relevant topic can go there. Only staff members can apply this tag, so if needed just ask one of our [admins or moderators](/about).\n* **`project-*`:** Projects by the Edgeryders company (for example #project-opencare::tag), but also projects by members of the Edgeryders community that are spread over more than 1-2 topics (for example #project-biochar-rocket-stove::tag).\n* **`{projectname}-*`:** A tag namespace for each project, using the same project name as the `project-*` tags. This allows project teams to manage their own set of tags in any way they like, without having to fear that any moderator might interfere with the naming or application of these tags. Not used much so far, but two examples are #unmonastery-evaluation::tag and #unmonastery-book-of-mistakes::tag, belonging to project #project-unmonastery::tag.   \n* **`ethno-*`:** Selections of content created for research projects done with the [Open Ethnographer](/t/id/6811) software. This type of tags can only be applied or removed by staff members.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-3\">4.3. Creating a wiki</h3>\n\nWikis are just normal posts in Discourse, except that they can be edited by every user and not only by its author and moderators. Wiki posts are recognizable by their special green icon in their top right, for example:\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/2/2c7548a7249b8890eb8f813704c734775e641a94.png\" width=\"100\">\n\nMore precisely, wikis can be edited by every user we trust for that, configured currently to \"trust level 1\" \u2013 every user who is not so totally new that their username appears in light gray. That is also the current trust level requirement to be able to make ones own post into a wiki \u2013 you do not have to be moderator or admin for that.\n\nTo create a wiki:\n\n1. **Create a topic.** Because usually, by convention, we only create wikis out of the first posts of a topic. But technically, it works with every post \u2013 first posts in a topic as well as comments.\n\n2. **Click \"Make Wiki\".** You find this button after saving your post by clicking on the grey \"**\u2026**\" below it, then on the grey wrench icon.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-4\">4.4. Adding link targets</h3>\n\nIf you want to create and share links that jump to a certain position inside the webpage when visiting them, you can do so as follows:\n\n1. **Add a HTML heading tag** (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) to your content at the position where you want to place your link target. If you want to combine this with a heading, use `<h1>` to `<h5>` as they are designed to be used. If you want an invisible link target, use `<h6>` because we adapted the Discourse CSS to make it invisible.\n\n2. **Add an `id` attribute** to your heading tag with a value starting with `heading--`. How you complete the attribute's value after that is up to you. A widely used convention is to use only lowercase characters, digits and dashes `-` though. Your finished link target would look like in these examples:\n\n        <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2. My Title for The Second Chapter</h2>\n        \n        <h6 id=\"heading--invisible-link-target\"></h6>\n\n3. **Create and test the link** you want to share as follows: the normal Discourse link to the topic or post as copied from your browser's address bar, with your `#heading--\u2026` ID appended. For example, this section about link targets has a link target itself, and the link would be:\n\n        https://edgeryders.eu/t/discourse-user-manual-for-edgeryders-eu/6463#heading--2-19\n\n    If this topic had several posts by several users, a link to a link target in post no. 5 would be:\n\n        https://edgeryders.eu/t/discourse-user-manual-for-edgeryders-eu/6463/5#heading--1\n\n4. **Optionally: shorten your link.** You can shorten the link you constructed above by replacing the title slug with something short. We use a minus \"`-`\" by convention, as it is also used for this purpose in the Discourse admin backend at times:\n\n        https://edgeryders.eu/t/-/6463#heading--2-19\n\n    [details=\"Caveats\"]\n    Due to a bug in Discourse, at the current time (2019-03) you can _not_ completely remove the title element. The link `https://edgeryders.eu/t/6463#heading--2-19` would work only half way then: it will leads to the topic, but not to the section because the subpart marker will be lost during the internal link forwarding process.\n\n    Additionally, another bug in earlier versions of Discourse that has been fixed by now prevented the `/t/6463` link format from working within the same website. It did work for links clicked on external domains, though.\n\n    Additionally, another bug in Discourse currently causes links in the `https://edgeryders.eu/t/-/6463#heading--2-19` format as created above to drop their `#heading--\u2026` subpart marker during a link forwarding step. This happens after the jump to the right subsection has been made, so you can use these links already. If you want to avoid the dropping of `#heading--\u2026` right now, you have to use the link with the current version of the title slug, without abbreviating it in any way (beyond making it a relative link, where applicable).\n    [/details]\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-5\">4.5. Adding a table of contents</h3>\n\nWe have a convention for headings and a table of contents that lets you jump to all headings in a post (usually only in the first post of a topic, often a wiki). Detailed instructions are in topic \"[Adding a table of contents](/t/id/7543)\".\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-6\">4.6. Creating posts in multiple languages</h3>\n\nIf your content comes with translations into other languages, our convention here is to format it as seen in [this example](/t/id/1761) and described below.\n\n\n#### (1) List the available languages\n\nAt the very top of your post, create a list with links to the available language versions, by using Markdown code based on this template:\n\n    **_Available in: :gb: [English](#heading--en) / :ru: [Russian](#heading--ru)_** \n\nIt will result in the following output (minus the quote formatting):\n\n> **_Available in: :gb: [English](#heading--en) /  :ru: [Russian](#heading--ru)_**\n\nThis list takes on a similar role to a table of contents, just that in contrast to [our usual way of adding a table of contents](/t/id/7543), you use subpart markers in the hyperlinks made from `#heading--` plus a [two-letter language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes). Using subpart markers that start with `#heading--` is needed because it's the only way to create links that work from external pages and sites as well and not just within the same post.\n\nThe `:gb:` and `:ru:` code pieces will show the flag icons. Just type `:`, select \"more\u2026\" from the popup menu that appears, and see if your flag icon is already available. Some are in the \"Custom\" section, as we added them ourselves. If your desired flag icon is not to be found, just omit it \u2013 an admin will notice and add it to your post later.\n\n\n#### (2) Add language headers to the different language versions\n\nBefore you start your content in a new language, you need to include a language header like this (for English):\n\n    ## <h2 id=\"heading--en\">:gb: _English version_</h2>\n\nor this (for Russian):\n\n    ## <h2 id=\"heading--ru\">:ru: _Russian version_</h2>\n\nand similar for other languages, again using the flag icons and [two-letter language codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes). The `<h2 id=\"\u2026\">\u2026</h2>` tag defines a target to jump to, used in your hyperlinks in the list of available languages. As a result, you will see:\n\n> ## :gb: _English version_\n>\n> (Your English content goes here.)\n\n> ## :ru: _Russian version_\n>\n> (Your Russian content goes here.)\n\n\n#### (3) Separate the different language versions\n\nPut code like this before the language header of each language version, which will create a simple horizontal line as a separator in the output:\n\n    ---\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--5\">5. Other aspects</h2>\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--5-1\">5.1. Deleting your account</h3>\n\nDeleting your account is possible, but not straightforward because our software solution \"[Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/)\" includes various protections against forum vandalism and moderator damage. We recommend the following procedure:\n\n1. **Download your content.** If you want to keep the content you posted, perhaps to upload it somewhere else, you should download it before deleting your account. For that, navigate to \"user menu \u2192 :gear: \u2192 Activity\", and click <kbd>Download My Posts</kbd>.\n\n2. **Delete your account.** The simplest way for this depends on how much and what kind of content you posted \u2013 please unfold the suitable section below.\n\n    If you posted \u2026\n\n    [details=\"\u2026 substantial content\"]\n    Note that according to [our Terms of Use in section \"3.1. Licensing of single contributions\"](/t/id/44#heading--3-1), you granted everyone a Creative Commons Attribution licence for your content. So in case you posted anything substantial that might be of interest to others on the Internet, we as the Edgeryders O\u00dc company would like to use that licence grant and keep your content online. Properly attributed of course. For that:\n\n    1. Go through the content you posted and remove whatever information you don't want to be online after your account deletion. This is meant to apply to sensitive information like names and personal information that might get people into trouble later. You find an overview of all the content you posted in the \"user menu \u2192 :gear: \u2192 Activity\" section. \n\n    2.  Optional: if you want, edit some or all pieces of your content and add to the bottom to whom that piece should be attributed when using it under the Creative Commons licence. For content where you don't do this, we will assume you want it attributed to the pseudonymous `@anon\u2026` user that will replace your username after your account has been anonymized by us.\n\n    3. Contact us, either by simply sending a direct message to @matthias or from our [contact page](/t/id/39), to ask for account deletion while preserving the content. Also mention if you have made any edits to hide information.\n\n        An admin will then anonymize your account with a Discourse admin feature, which removes your e-mail address and all profile information and changes the username to `@anon\u2026` ([example](/u/anon87623122/summary)). This automatically also changes all your @mentions to that anonymized username. If you made edits to hide information, an admin will remove the old revisions of the posts you edited from public access by setting them to \"hidden\".\n    [/details]\n\n    [details=\"\u2026 substantial content and you really want it deleted\"]First delete all posts that you really want deleted (you find an overview of all the content you posted in the \"user menu \u2192 :gear: \u2192 Activity\" section). Then proceed as described under \"If you posted something substantial\". Or in case you really want everything you wrote deleted an it's too much for you to delete it manually, proceed as described under \"If you posted nothing substantial, but a lot\".[/details]\n\n    [details=\"\u2026 nothing substantial\"]If you posted nothing of significance for the general public (say, you only participated in organizing an event or similar), you can delete all your posts by yourself first. (You find an overview of all the content you posted in the \"user menu \u2192 :gear: \u2192 Activity\" section.) After that, you can delete your account by navigating to \"user menu \u2192 :gear:\" and clicking the <kbd>Delete My Account</kbd> button at the bottom ([source](https://meta.discourse.org/t/10732/5)).[/details]\n\n    [details=\"\u2026 nothing substantial but a lot\"]If you posted (say) 20 or more times, then the previous process of deleting your own content one by one becomes too uncomfortable. In such a case, you can contact us, either by simply sending a direct message to @matthias or from our [contact page](/t/id/39), and ask for account deletion incl. content deletion. An admin user will do that for you, using a different kind of tool. Please allow up to 10 working days for that to happen, as we won't always find time to do this immediately.[/details]\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--5-2\">5.2. Posting links to Discourse topics on Facebook</h3>\n\nIt is possible to post links to a topic on this website on Facebook in such a way that Facebook generates a proper preview image for it. \n\nThis is not guaranteed to work with links to _posts_ (replies to a forum topic, with URLs of the form `https://example.com/t/title/1234`**`/12`**). In these cases, Facebook might use a preview image from higher up in the topic. But it works properly with _topics_ (with URLs of the form `https://example.com/t/title/1234`) if they contain an image.\n\nHere are the instructions:\n\n1. **Create your topic** on this website, and include an image.\n\n2. **Start to create a post on Facebook and paste the link to your topic.** Often enough, Facebook will not show any preview image yet, namely if you are the first person ever sharing that link on Facebook.\n\n3. **Wait for 2-4 minutes.** Facebook needs that long to create a preview and sort it into its own systems.\n\n4. **Delete the link and paste it again.** Without saving / posting the Facebook post, delete the link you inserted above, and then insert the same link again. Now, the new preview should include a proper preview image.\n\n5. **Save the post** to publish it on Facebook.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--5-3\">5.3. Making link previews work for embedded videos</h3>\n\nSee this topic for detailed instructions:\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/making-link-previews-work-for-embedded-videos/9473\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--5-4\">5.4. Converting a topic to PDF</h3>\n\nSometimes, you want a PDF in a higher quality than what you get by using the browser's print function on the page of a Discourse topic. Mostly, you'll want to remove the author avatar, comments, header and footer menu. Here's how:\n\n1. Construct the URL of the print-optimized version by appending `?_escaped_fragment_` to the normal URL of the Discourse topic. For example, you will get https://edgeryders.eu/t/openvillage-house-sidi-kaouki-manual/7955?\\_escaped_fragment_.\n\n2. Visit that URL and choose \"right click menu \u2192 Save as \u2026\" and save with type \"Webpage, complete\".\n\n3. Open the resulting `.html` file in a text editor and remove the sections you don't want (comments, header and footer menu, author avatar).\n\n4. Still in the text editor, convert all links to other parts of the document to relative links that only use the subpart marker, for example `<a href=\"#chap-2-9\">\u2026</a>`. Only then they will scroll the PDF document, otherwise they would open in a browser. To convert the links, search for the full URL of the document you saved and replace all occurrences with nothing.\n\n5. Save the `.html` file and open it in the browser and choose \"right click menu \u2192 Print \u2026\", then save it to a PDF.\n\nAlternatives include selecting the desired content in your browser and copy&pasting it to a new LibreOffice Writer document. However, this resulted in several formatting glitches (headers look like normal text, some numbering sections use a different font etc.).\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--5-5\">5.5. Following content by RSS</h3>\n\nYou can append `.rss` to any URL of a Discourse topic, category or tag to get the associated RSS feed URL. Put that URL into your RSS reader to follow the content. This is an alternative to having an account and using the [Discourse e-mail notifications](/t/-/6463#heading--2-8).\n\nException: If you want to follow content in a non-public category via RSS, you will need an account because you will also need to add your API key for authentication. (Ask a moderator or admin to create an API key for you if you don't have one yet.) In this case, the URL format to use is this:\n\n```plaintext\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/c/cat/subcat.rss?api_key=\u2026\n```\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--5-6\">5.6. Administration functions and other advanced uses</h3>\n\nIf you are interested in the administration functions of [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) (our website's software) or in some tips and tricks for advanced use of Discourse, have a look at the administration manual that we wrote:\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/green-book-discourse-admin-manual/6647", "created_at": "2017-07-12 15:32:45.323324", "updated_at": "2020-12-08 18:23:57.673820", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 13160, "wiki": true, "reads": 110, "score": 3929.0, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [34559, 37671, 50708, 34014], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2567, 3791, 5, 3, 6107], "is_private": false}, {"id": 70773, "user_id": 4892, "topic_id": 12721, "post_number": 7, "raw": "I very much like the idea of new municipalisms, a refreshing departure from the (potentially localist) city / urban idiom.

And if you do fail, someone may or may not lend you a hand.  I, who have paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes over the course of my life, want that money to help people with education, health care, food, shelter, etc.  Not bombs, war and destruction.

The jury panel has now <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/culture/our-programmes-and-actions/doc/ecoc/ecoc-italy2019-preselection-report-dec2013.pdf\">published the motivations</a> for its choice: each of the 21 Italian contenders's judgement is summarized in a paragraph of text. The one describing Matera mentions Edgeryders-related activities three times in just 12 lines of text:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>when it mentions that the bid \"was rooted in creating change through\u00a0citizenship and participation. The active engagement of citizens in the bid preparation and the plans\u00a0to sustain this during the ECOC [...]\". The active engagement of citizens is mostly a function of the <a href=\"http://community.matera-basilicata2019.it\">Matera2019 online community</a>, dreamed up and executed by a group directed by myself and to which many Edgeryders participated in the runup to LOTE3.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>when it mentions the <a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315\">unMonastery</a> and the <a href=\"/t/the-resilient-cities-challenge/324\">Resilient Cities Challenge</a> as initatives that address the European dimension of Matera's ECOC bid. Both initiatives were conceived and executed in Edgeryders, by edgeryders.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nSo, it seems that we do have some traction in driving ECOC bids. Should we try to get better at this, and maybe turn it into a \"normal\" Edgeryders activity (to the extent, of course, that anything about Edgeryders is normal)?\u00a0Is <em>your</em> city interested in being European City of Culture?

Lejla will be the lead UNDP contact. My attempts to arrive at a decision from UNDP have been frustrated by delays, postponements and a seeming lack of urgency on their part. In the end, it appears that they see the opportunities and are committed to participating in the Berlin festival. I have remained in close contact with the festival organisers, and we have confirmed that UNDP/Edgeryders will curate two panels, both taking place on Saturday 21 September. In a conversation with Lejla on Wednesday, she proposed a 'consultancy contract' between UNDP and ER with 3 main deliverables: i. assisting with developing the content and approach to the panels at the festival; ii. updating the concept note for BH Fellowships;  iii. assist UNDP at the festival in engaging partners/donors. I sent my proposed budget ($9800) to you separately. In addition to a consultancy fee, UNDP will also pay travel costs for ER attending the festival. \nLejla said she would send me her initial thoughts about the panels. speakers etc. I am still waiting for this, and the Berlin organisers asked me to provide details today. If I don't receive anything, I will go ahead myself and submit a draft description of the panels. Lejla goes on holiday next week, which will may mean a further delay. I am taking on trust the fact that she said a contract with ER can be 'easily' fast-tracked and would be completed within 2 weeks, since it falls below a threshold of $10k.\nER will not be responsible for the two panels; we (me) will be advising UNDP, but UNDP will undertake all the management, logistics, etc. The two panels proposed are as follows;\n1. _**Hacking Bureaucracy**_: a panel discussion with 3-4 'bureaucrat hackers' speaking about their 'hacks' similar to the Cas event, followed by a general discussion + questions from the public. UNDP will suggest and contact all speakers. I will probably end up moderating and speaking to each of the panelists before the festival and creating a narrative of some kind. Depending on the speakers chosen, an alternative might be to present one main 'hack' and then have the others comment on this, including the issues involved in 'hacking' a bureaucratic system in the public sector. \n2. **_**Changing Bureaucracy from the Edge**_**: this panel will comprise UNDP officials (from NY, Istanbul or other offices) and focus on approaches, tools, processes used by UNDP (such as the Accelerator Labs, other innovation incentives, etc), and ER to present their approach (building communities, use of online platforms, tools) that are relevant to public sector bureaucracies. For ER, this is simply an opportunity to expose our work to a largely professional public who probably has never heard of ER. I guess it could be conceived as a 'pitch' for more work in the public domain as consultants or advisers or project leaders. The ER presentation would need to be 'geared' to public sector managers and leaders, as well as to governments, foundations and other funders who will be attending the festival. I will encourage UNDP to speak briefly about the BH Fellowship proposal, and ER could pick this up and endorse the idea. On this panel, there could be 2, but we could get away with 1 ER doing the presentation. After the presentations, there would be a short discussion (UNDP/ER) possibly moderated by me, and then questions from the public.\n\nDue to the delays from UNDP and the shortage of time, I have abandoned the idea of ER organising a workshop at the festival. The panel discussion will be a kind of 'taster' to whet the appetite for ER work.\n\nThere will be potential donors attending the festival (government ministries, private foundations, international organisations  etc). We will have a list of these contacts, and the festival will help us organise one-to-one meetings to describe and discuss the BH Fellowship proposal and generate interest. UNDP and ER would be at the meetings. UNDP would take responsibility for any follow-up. UNDP has agreed to organise a follow-up meeting with potential donors in Istanbul (possibly October or November). So, in addition to me, one or two other ER should help assist at the meetings.\n\nThe festival offers a networking opportunity for ER. There will be many panel discussions, presentations, keynote speakers, stands and exhibitions, receptions, etc. Having at least 3 of us present would be helpful. \n\nThe festival may also be of interest to others in the ER community who are working in the public sector, and the event should be communicated to them. Certainly those who live in/near Berlin might attend, and others too. \n\nTo be clear, assuming the contract with UNDP is confirmed, I am asking you @alberto @noemi to be involved. I will do all the heavy lifting, liaison with UNDP and the festival, and content development. I will need you to offer advice, assist with an updating of the BH Fellowship concept note, give brief presentations on a panel and contribute to the donor meetings, as appropriate. The commitment would be to do a little preparation (half-day) and attend the festival (20-22 September). Easy to travel Brussels-Berlin. If not you, who else?\n\nI will continue to post updates here, Let me know if you have any questions.

I read Bendell's paper when it came out. My impression it was dark, depressing, and defeatist, but perfectly possible. Climatic system tipping points are far, far less understood than the linear relation between CO2e, heat and climate change, but there is widespread agreement that they're out there (the PNAS 'Hothouse Earth' paper being a great overview). A decade or so ago James Hansen said that his guess was that there was a 20% chance that it was too late. After all the recent dismal data from the poles, the permafrost, tropical soils, etc., that guess would probably be revised upwards. The beginning of this collapse may happen next year, it may happen in 2100, or it may already already have happened. IMHO the only honest answer is that we don't know, and my response is to assume that there's hope until it's proven there isn't.\n\nWith that in mind I think Bendell's social analysis that you've quoted is spot on (and well and concisely expressed), and that his prescriptions for restoration are widely shared. I like his focus on relinquishment and on the importance of letting go because I have come to believe that the inability to let go (of ideas, habits, norms, beliefs, etc.) is the biggest barrier to any change. Adopting the new is often exciting and energising. It's letting go of the familiar and comfortable old that's hard.\n\nIn terms of collaborating on presumably unpaid work there's not much I can do. I've spent the last few years working mainly on advocating and lobbying for carbon dividends in Ireland (carbon tax with revenue distributed equally to all), and with some success (results to be announced in this October's budget). There's no shortage of meaningful work around for those who understand the scale and significance of our climate crisis - the big problem is finding meaningful work that pays the internet and electricity bills. In an attempt to reconcile these two imperatives I'm now focusing on carbon and climate risk disclosure for the corporate (and government/NGO) market - essentially selling my services as a teacher on climate and carbon (see: [carbontide.com](http://www.carbontide.com/) and [my desktop presentation](https://youtu.be/iUyzFt09DNQ?t=42)).\n\nKind regards,\nGraham", "created_at": "2019-09-10 10:05:27", "updated_at": "2019-09-10 13:04:19.693342", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 391, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 43.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [59017], "is_liked_by": [5, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 76187, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 13495, "post_number": 1, "raw": "OpenCare (2016-2017) prototypes a community-driven model of addressing social and health care, and explore its implications at scale.

We will look specifically at health- and workplace-related data, as this data is arguably the most personal, sensitive, and vulnerable to misuse. At the same time, it is precisely because of this that it offers a way to engage with data sovereignty concerns.\n**Context**: Developing a holistic approach to data literacy begins with awareness of the many overlapping data-generating contexts we pass through as we live and labor. As far as the bigger picture is concerned, this is it a key step toward co-designing that which affects how we act - collective intelligence design enables deep engagement with the socio-technological infrastructures structuring and sustaining our agency. Workshop in cooperation with [Open Saar e.V.](https://opensaar.de/)\n\n**Workshop II Community Architectures**\n[date=2019-11-28 timezone=\"Europe/Brussels\"] \u2192 [date=2019-11-28 timezone=\"Europe/Brussels\"]\n\n**Theme**: How do we bring sustainable architecture / upcycling / renewable energy communities into the design process of a workspace for a new commons-oriented cooperative?\n**Context**: Members of the Academy of Fine Arts Saar have initiated the foundation of a cooperative (s:coop) to actively contribute to a new economy. Locally, this has involved exchanges with various actors from freelancing, innovation, and start-up communities. Now the time has come to develop and design a physical space that can operate as a community architecture. And one way to get started is to look what others have already done.\n\n\n\n**Workshop III Data Governance and Decentralized Technologies**\n[date=2019-11-29 timezone=\"Europe/Brussels\"] \u2192 [date=2019-11-29 timezone=\"Europe/Brussels\"]\n**Theme**: New ideas related to data governance have come from communities engaging with blockchain technologies. We will take a look at some of these ideas and bring them together with approaches from the [cooperative](https://www.saluscoop.org/) universe. Workshop III offers in-depth follow-up to Workshop I.\n**Context**: Decentralized technologies have become key areas of collective intelligence design [experimentation](http://daostack.io). While some of these efforts have been criticized for reproducing the not-so-open geek cultures of tech research (\"blokechain\"), these technologies are too important to leave them to the usual techno-libertarian suspects. So we need to find ways to bring more people into a key systems design process.\n\n* **ORGANISER CHECKLIST** : _Please ensure each of these things are done, the person mentioned is responsible but you as an organiser are responsible to contact them and make sure they have what they need from you!_\n1.

Living in safe, fair and decent housing is one of the fundamental human rights! Sadly, different groups of people are facing different kinds of problems and obstacles in the housing market.\n\nHackathon about affordable housing is an intensive and focused team activity where people with different capabilities and knowledge cooperate to solve problems or create projects regarding affordable housing in the Czech Republic.\n\nAnyone can participate in the hackathon. We are looking for people with different life experience, who are interested in housing-related issues. The participants will divide in groups of 2 to 5 people and from Saturday morning to Sunday noon will be intensively working on real projects and products that aim to help ordinary people with their housing situation.\n\nMore: https://edgeryders.eu/t/brno-cze-hackathon-on-affordable-housing-panel-discussion/11185\n\n12.

Main topics: How important is human interaction and collaboration\n\n**Plan:**\nThe event will be divided into two parts:\n\n1. Storytelling- speakers will introduce their stories. We are planning to have 3-4 storytellers.This part lasts for about 2h. After introduction we all have lunch and spend time together.\n2. Open discussion about human interaction and collaboration. Hopefully others would also like to talk about their stories and things they find important.\n\nSince the main topics are about human interaction and collaboration that\u2019s exactly what we are focusing upon the whole event. The goal here is for the people to get to know each other and to make some good contacts. For those who like to do things on their own and not to wait for the institutions to do that for them. Introduce the EdgeRyders community to them to consider that platform as a valid place where they can contact with those of same thinking, to ease that connecting.", "created_at": "2019-09-10 10:49:25.344783", "updated_at": "2019-10-18 13:08:59.100461", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 5148, "wiki": true, "reads": 51, "score": 769.2, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2567, 4, 4934, 1856, 5211], "is_private": false}, {"id": 37381, "user_id": 3622, "topic_id": 7260, "post_number": 2, "raw": "No problem", "created_at": "2017-10-03 09:32:04.923557", "updated_at": "2017-10-03 09:32:04.923557", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 1.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 52732, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 9618, "post_number": 10, "raw": "There will be a call tomorrow at 10 in the morning, CET time - if anyone wants to join, feel free.

Since @Mikomann took a huge initiative and moved a lot of pieces forward, I am keen on supporting his daring idea of creating a space for a dialogue beyond differences, especially since a star facilitator got so intrigued by this proposal, he is doing it for a symbolic fee. **This part of the event is called Open Forum, and it uses various methods of psychological work to help people meet and understand each other, using the psychology of process as a tool.**\n\nI would like to add a small conversational situation to it, centered either around **food making** (a cooking workshop if only we manage to find a space with a kitchen) with a facilitated, intimate discussion about the state of the world today, as well as a **tattoo session** with a fundraiser. I am aiming at inviting the Declaration of Human Rights tattoo project or making something similar. You get a cheap tattoo, your money goes for a valuable cause, and while you suffer, we ask questions. \n\nSince the budget we have is not enough to cover everything we want to do, we are now also looking for additional funds to cover it. **And we are still open to hosting someone from the network to give a session in this framework. Maybe in a way someone from NGI who specialises with ads and data and social platforms, who could translate the profit of using spaces as edgeryders to our audience and motivate them this way to leave the fb groups in which they discuss their issues and come here, where we promise not to use their data in ways they never consent?**\n\nI am also mowing my way through the posts that have been added to the platform lately- we have put a pause on the collection of stories, as it became obvious that the way the platform looks and what is offered is not enough to keep people coming back here. Even the awards do not seem to make a huge difference - a commitment to this discussion means time, and we know how it is with it. So, we are now trying to focus on bringing on board a specific group that could use edgeryders as a home, such as activists suffering from terrible conditions and burnout in Poland. But this is yet to be developed, for now, we have a few incredible activists, but also very busy persons, present here. \n\nI also suggested maybe moving one of the male-circles here, as it is obviously a growing topic and something that maybe would use this kind of forum. \n\nI can see how my hires are growing both scared and frustrated by the lack of efforts of their work, and that forces me to spend a lot of time thinking how to adapt the approach, adjust the conversation starters and somehow rebrand the platform for our users. \n\nOtherwise, i am still going through the painful process of the interface design with a more quizzy touch to it.

When we put this together, patterns start to emerge that help join these ideas and people to each other and to other information, skill and resources.\n\nBy the end of the process, our community members have gained a richer knowledge and understanding of the issue they wish to tackle and have a blueprint to put their idea into action.\n\n## Shape the agenda with us!\n\n*The event program is built with, by and for participants.

Sicily\u2019s economy and society have long been crippled by high unemployment, inefficient public services, corruption and organized crime. Yet, over the past ten years or so, a small cohort of about 120 enterprises in Messina, working closely together, have managed to build a solid, long-termist, fair, human-centric economy \u2013 and achieve stability and prosperity in the process. They call themselves \u201cthe Messina advanced cluster\u201d. To get where they are now, they had to re-invent a lot of economic concepts. The familiar ones (\u201cmaximizing shareholder value\u201d, \u201ccorrect market failures\u201d etc.) were simply not working out for Sicily, and for their goals. So, as they re-built their local economy, they developed their own economic thinking, with concepts such as \u201crelational goods\u201d, \u201cstocks as autonomy\u201d, and \u201csystems, not networks\u201d. Even their innovation is weird: solar panels made out of the pulp of waste oranges? A People\u2019s Energy Company? In this webinar, you will learn how they built this incredible success under very difficult conditions, and how their way of thinking might help you along your own journey. \n\n**July 21st, 2020:** **[How can we support the recovery of the co-working sector?](https://edgeryders.eu/t/how-can-we-support-the-coworking-sector/14006)** The purpose of the event is to explore how we can support the recovery of the coworking sector, which has been turned on its head with restrictions put in place to protect public health. With the future of work shaping up for a big move to remote work, it looks like our coworking spaces will be a big part of more people\u2019s lives. Some early indications from some of our speakers already show this. Erin Westover is the European market lead at proptech company Upflex, which has seen an uptick in inquiries since Covid-19 hit as organisations have decided to make a move toward distributed work. Upflex works with established companies that have staff working remotely and allows employees to see which co-working spaces near their homes are free.

So how do we avoid these situations in the future? How do we make sure that we have the fundamental requirements to stay alive when crisis hits? In this series of listening sessions and follow up discussions we explore credible paths moving forward based on real life cases, not pie in the sky scenarios. And we will map out what actions we can do today, to prevent crises tomorrow. *Possible partners*: several in the works, more suggestions welcome.* \n\n\n**October 14th, 2020:** **How to support regions in times of crisis:**   *We bring together speakers from the Commission, DG REGIO, Committee of the Regions and they can present Commission\u2019s initiatives, financial instruments for faster crisis response, EU funding possibilities. @andreja is working on this.**\n\n\n\n **Paradises Built in Hell - Economics, Science Fiction and Entrepreneurship beyond capitalism *([with focus on alternative regional economic development](https://edgeryders.eu/t/long-termism-in-economic-thinking-reflecting-on-the-experience-of-the-messina-advanced-cluster/12883))***: *Curated by @alberto at the Science Fiction Economics Lab.

On top of pushing out the final workshop itself, we would also share links on interesting initiatives from the community, emphasizing those that have sprung from STF itself (like the project of a <a href=\"/t/inspire-armenians-to-find-the-work-they-really-love/2784\">TEDx on work and meaning in Yerevan</a>)\u00a0but also others, shining some light on the many initiatives at the edge that are, daily, building the future we'll all live in. I expect the main impact of the Twitterstorm to be cognitive: people should perceive more clearly the broader community beyond the scene and the country they inhabit. Certainly, it worked for us in Western Europe. People saw tweets in Russian and Portuguese and went \"wow, we are all over the place\". The key is obviously \"we\".\n\nIn order to do the Twitterstorm we need:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>an info page on some website, with the dates and the place of the final workshop.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>about 10-15 links to other STF-ER initiatives that we want to promote.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nRemember that unfortunately we have been unable to find dates that accommodate everyone for the event.

My apologies for the incorrect assumption - I may have been conditioned by a few years of (and many requests for) very important, meaningful and unpaid work!\n\nMy nascent business in is at www.CarbonTide.com, and the video desktop presentation is at https://youtu.be/iUyzFt09DNQ?t=42.\n\nI absolutely agree with the point of Bendell and so many others that market fundamentalism, hyper-individualistic consumerism, and market-motivated efforts to frustrate and delay real climate action. However I'm also very aware that market freedom creates huge value as well as huge destruction and waste. More importantly, and whatever one's ideological view, I recognise market support as a social and political fact of life and thus integral to any possible or realistic hope we might have escaping the nightmare that Bendell describes.\n\nWith that said, my focus is on visibility - on making climate change visible. This involves internalising the cost of climate change into the price of everything (carbon pricing), making full and accessible information on the carbon content and climate consequences for every carbon-intensive activity (carbon labeling), and giving investors, customers, employees and other stakeholders full information on the carbon content and climate risk of every significant organisation (carbon and climate disclosure). My thesis and argument is that \"the market\" is not free or rational or effective without full information (including price and disclosure information) being available to every participant at the point of every spending or investment decision.\n\nIn the time we have left (if we have time left) it is not realistic, IMHO, to \"overthrow capitalism\" or \"awaken the consciousness\" of the world, etc. On the other hand, money talks, and money effects the decisions of everybody regardless of what they believe, or what they care about, or what they know about. So my focus is essentially at the intersection of climate change, money, and politics. Keep an eye on Ireland and carbon tax over the next six weeks or so to find out if that's had a meaningful impact.\n\nOutside of the fossil fuel industry and their ilk there's essentially zero funding for political lobbying, so I'm dumping the political activism. My focus is now on climate change and money, and in particular helping the money understand climate change and the risks it poses for money. There is substantial movement here, with huge investor concern, mandatory carbon/climate risk disclosure on the horizon, and rapidly-growing awareness of carbon dividends as a way to get around Gilet Jaune-type opposition to carbon pricing that financally-pressed people can't afford.\n\nPeople might not care about climate climate, they might not care about the Amazon or Arctic, and they might not care about future generations. But they certainly care about money - especially those for whom money is a core value. Systemic changes like meaningful carbon pricing (think \u20ac200/ton+) and full disclosure make it pay to do the right thing, make it cost to do the wrong thing, and introduce the fear of losing money to every investor and business. These are powerful motivators.\n\nFinally, none of this in any way negates other measures. I support any and all measures that help move us away from carbon, including draconian regulation. But you have to focus on something specific to have an effect, and these market measures are my primary focus!\n\nBest wishes,\n\nGraham\n\n-- \nGraham Caswell\n\nCarbon Tide\nContext for the Carbon Transition\nwww.CarbonTide.com\n+353-(0)85-1656675", "created_at": "2019-09-10 13:01:27.372760", "updated_at": "2019-09-10 13:01:27.372760", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 583, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 43.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 5201], "is_private": false}, {"id": 37407, "user_id": 3362, "topic_id": 6643, "post_number": 23, "raw": "I'm also interested in how the ideas found their way into the game and if you need anything from us in preparation for the event @matteo_uguzzoni", "created_at": "2017-10-03 15:03:39.127883", "updated_at": "2017-10-03 15:03:39.127883", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 27, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 6.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [37375], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60472, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 10731, "post_number": 11, "raw": "looks like the totally right direction :)", "created_at": "2019-10-03 08:31:11.757032", "updated_at": "2019-10-03 08:31:11.757032", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 6, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 19.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [60307], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 58602, "user_id": 4683, "topic_id": 10627, "post_number": 5, "raw": "I did not know the process of consortium building and proposal writing; hence, I have no insights into 'who missed what &when'?. My view is shaped along the following lines:\n\n1) Assuming that you had a standard process of 'consortium building and proposal writing' the distribution of strengths and weaknesses will follow the 'standard model' (whatever this is) that leads to a typical H2020 success rate (of single proposals) of (let's assume) 15% ([figure may be lower](http://www.accelopment.com/blog/lessons-learnt-from-horizon-2020-for-its-final-2-years)). This means that being in four proposals has a' likelihood to gain': 0,0005 for 4 grants; 0,0115 for 3 grants; 0,0975 for 2 grants; 0,3685 for 1 grant; and 0,5220 for 0 grant.  \n2) Taking a success rate of 12% rises the likelihood of 'no grant in four' to 60% and lowers the likelihood for 'one grant in four' to 33%. Hence, statistically your outcome is not shocking! \n3) What is to check is the assumption __'H2020 standard process of consortium building and proposal writing'._ You may have faced less favourable conditions; but the statistics do not indicate it!\n\n4) Under the assumption 'H2020 standard process of consortium building and proposal writing' the most likely root cause _'to have messed it up, in the end'_ has to be something that damaged features of the proposal that would be needed to exceed the '85%-is-good-level'. That means, that the devil is in _'what the writer considers as less relevant'_ (=small or finer granularity). \n\nAgainst the background of the above, my reading of the excerpts from the proposal assessment is that too many of the (small  / considered as less relevant) features were missed that are 'needed to exceed the '85%-is-good-level'.  It is hard, but a proposal has to be written to match the '**95%**-is-good-level' to have a fair chance in a statistical sense and not being pure lottery.\n\nMy reading of proposals is/was 'from the end' (= what does the proposer plans to do when the work proposed 'here' is achieved). In cases that applicants have an idea about the step 'N+1' then (more often) they have (more) comprehensive understanding of 'what to do now' (step 'N'). My reading of the excerpts from the proposal assessment is that 'suchlike features' were missing (too) frequently. \n\nI hope that these lines help to handle this less-comforting experience.\nMartin", "created_at": "2019-08-30 09:16:14.620592", "updated_at": "2019-08-30 09:16:14.620592", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 418, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 57.2, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [58591], "is_liked_by": [4, 4096, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8084, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1459, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>A think tank (and yes, it's open)</b>\n\nMatthias, thanks again for great insight. This entry forced me to rethink our approach. However, at the end of the rethinking, I still stand for it. I think the risks to privacy in participating in the Edgeryders project are minimal. Let  me explain why.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Focus on the collective dimension</strong>. Everything in Edgeryders is about the extent to which my experiences can be somehow generalized, how they resonate with others. So, it is not about trying to find out idiosyncratic behavior that makes individuals stand out, but rather about rethinking what might <em>look</em> idiosyncratic as, rather, shared and therefore socially justified. For example, many people here have spoken out against ACTA. Others have highlighted the importance of a free Internet with freely shareable content as a place for learning, a professional resource for finding work, or for simply making everyone's life better through the creation and enhancement of digital commons. What Edgeryders does is tie these positions together into a policy recommendation that more or less says \"emphasizing IPRs is likely to hinder the transition of youth to an independent active life. We should handle the issue with care, and not assume hacktivists are troublemakers and should go look for jobs. They need the Internet to be free to even carve a professional niche for themselves.\"  So, while the trends we pick up are certainly interesting for government, individual behavior is not.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Focus on world building</strong>. Edgeryders has no missions about consumer behavior. It is not interested in what movies we watch or what clothes we wear. It looks at world building exercises (how to combine crafts and e-commerce; designing bottom-up currencies; collaborative living; peer-to-peer learning). Not much interesting data for business here - at least, not for sales. Some might be interested, again, in the long-term market implications of some of the stuff discussed here, but not much in the way of finding individual consumers to sell stuff to.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThese two features are reflected in the ethnographic coding, which I think you might have misunderstood. In ethnographerese, coding means tagging. As you write you participated in Erasmus, the ethnographer tags with the sentence with a code like \"spatial mobility\". If you heard about a job opening from a friend, she would tag it with \"opportunities from peers\" or something similar. Here's an example from a study about dementia carers:\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://onlineqda.hud.ac.uk/Step_by_step_software/Atlas.ti/Images/Atlas5_code_manger.jpg\" style=\"width: 447px; height: 464px;\">\n\nSo, by design there is not a lot of attention on anything individually sensitive. That goes both for the raw and for the coded data.\n\nFor any remaining potential problems, we were careful to frame Edgeryders interaction away from danger. We did this through three tools.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Validation</strong>. The results of the ethnographic study are published on the website for community validation. If you disagree with something, you can always speak up. The first bit of results is <a href=\"/where-edgeryders-dare/mission_case/learning-%E2%80%9Cnew-kind-working-life%E2%80%9D\">here</a>.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Think tank metaphor.</strong> We define Edgeryders as a \"distributed think tank on youth policy\". This means clearly that it is a space for work, somewhere you go wearing a suit, as I like to say. Or maybe you prefer informal attire, but it is unlikely you'd show up in a bathrobe, no matter how informal your working environment. I think this is pretty clear from Edgeryders literature, for example our [presentation video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/DCocK4bKIFE).</li>\n\n<li>finally, we were quite explicit in the <a href=\"/t/id/44\">Legals</a> page: \n<strong>Please be aware</strong> that Edgeryders is a public space where you are responsible for what you post: if you are unsure whether it is legal or appropriate to share something, please don\u2019t.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nIt goes on to mention research purposes, and specifies an open license for user generated content. Finally, it mentions email as the only real bit of personal data we store (people can and do use handles, like you do yourself); that's covered by Council of Europe data protection policy .\n\nAnd yes, it's open, as open as I can get away with. Because it is research, paid for by the European taxpayer.\n\nHow can we improve? People can ask to be removed as users already; they can edit of change their content (there are now a, \"edit this mission\" and a \"delete this mission\" link next to your mission reports, so I see no reason for a content freeze period . Maybe we could explain better what the methodology of the project is. Actually, the methodology is itself emergent, and was not as clear to me when we wrote the Legals page.\n\nAny other suggestions?", "created_at": "2012-05-03 12:44:00", "updated_at": "2017-09-19 10:06:28.247791", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 827, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 70.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 58475, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 10628, "post_number": 1, "raw": "RezNet regulars know that we care deeply about citizen science (CS), and have already submitted two H2020 proposals on the subject, in 2018 and 2019. In this post, I want to reflect on where we are and propose how to move forward.\n\n## Strengths and weaknesses of EPICS according to the [evaluation results](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1NmAGkHCrSHVFBfllYaXIs6jSmgW8XKDt)\n\n* Excellence: 3.5 out of 5.\n* Impact: 4 out of 5.\n* Implementation: 4.5 out of 5.\n\n@marina and I discussed the evaluation at some depth. Our conclusion:\n\n### Strengths\n\n1.  Everything related to ethnography was appreciated: relevant, novel, innovative, achievable, clear etc.\n1.  The radical participatory approach was appreciated.\n1. The connection to industry (via Glimps, a contribution by @winnieponcelet) was a strong point. So was the participation of Coubnter Culture Labs (via @ramykim), that was correctly recognized as a good example of international cooperation.\n1.  The workplan and management structure (advisory board, ethics manager, risk manager etc.) were considered fully adequate. \n\n### Weaknesses and mitigation\n1. We failed to address the issue of how EPICS incentivizes career scientists to participate in CS projects. This was completely a mistake. We actually do have a mechanism for it (\"funders like participatory science, so if you learn to do it you stand to get more and better grants, publish more etc.\"), but treated this rather as an open question that EPICS would address. It probably cost us a full point, because it is quoted as a shortcoming both in excellence and in impact. **Mitigation**: for each objective of the call, write some confident language that our project will achieve it, not will find out how to achieve it.\n1. We failed to target existing CS projects. In our defense, we could not get the partner we wanted (European CS Association) and had to fall back to a Greek org that was not up to the task. **Mitigation**: invest on consortium building early on.\n1. Our plan for stakeholder involvement had a hole: policy makers. Again, we tried to build in the partnership a \"Gent cluster\", with Glimps (industry), U Gent (academia) and the city or the Flemish government (policy makers), but we were told public sector partner would not come on board within the timeline that we had. **Mitigation**: invest on consortium building early on. Local clusters are a good idea, I think.\n1. Dissemination was not convincing (but communication was). **Mitigation**: if I, a non-academic, am to act as the PO, we need someone who *is* an academic to flank me, and to take responsibility for dissemination. After all, almost all reviewers are academics, and they can tell a careful, informed approach to dissemination from my casual \"oh, well, there's plenty of conferences, we'll go to some of those\".\n1. Innovation management was not discussed, though the exploitation paths are clear. **Mitigation**: there is no innovation in EPICS (in the sense of an artifact, since Open Ethnographer and Graphryder already exist, and we have no mandate for spending serious money on more software). So, we simply need to state this.\n1. The risks involved in combining CS with ethnography \"are not fully considered\". This is considered a minor shortcoming. **Mitigation**: spend some extra time on ethical risks.  \n\n## What next?\n\nCitizen science is going to be a hot topic in the next and final round of Horizon 2020 calls. The calls themselves will be published in December 2019, but [the work programme](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2018-2020/main/h2020-wp1820-swfs_en.pdf) lists several topics around citizen science. We believe that there is a space for resubmitting an improved version of EPICS, and that we should do so. We would capitalize on the work already done, and \u2013 if successful \u2013 create value for our community. \n\nA good fit is sub-topic A of topic SwafS-27-2020. Its impact is supposed to be:\n\n> Development  of  new  scientific  knowledge  and/or  innovations  with/by citizen scientists. Evaluation evidence concerning the societal, democratic and economic costs and  benefits  of  citizen  science.  Consortia  should  choose  a  basket  of  indicators  to measure  the  impact  of  their  work.  In  particular,  consortia  are  expected  to  contribute  to one or more of the MoRRI indicators (for instance PE1 to PE10) and to the Sustainable Development Goals. \n\nSeems about right. EPICS is an ethnography *about* citizen science, that is _itself_ a citizen science project. \"Evaluation\" happens in the highly participatory way of ethnography. \n\nTo go about it, however, I would reform the consortium. \n\n* Include one \"local cluster\" (industry or SME + academia + public sector, all from the same territory). We could try again with Gent (my preference \u2013 no elections this year, so maybe we get more attention), or try to build Milan.\n* Rationalize academic presence. In EPICS we had three academic partners (U Aalborg, U Gent and POLIMI). Each of them was there for a reason, but there were two problems. One was limited involvement of senior staff (with the exception of @akmunk), which resulted in a not-too-strong approach to dissemination. The other was that there was crowding in the ethno area, with EDGE, T6, U Gent and U Aalborg all involved. And yes, we explained it fairly well and there were no complaints, but we do get a more complex work plan and the need to spread resources out. SxafS-27-2020 works with cuts of 2M EUR, so we will need to shrink the EPICS budget by 0.5M. In general, I would like to have one or two fewer partners, 7 or 8 instead of 9.\n* If we cannot get a high-level partner from the CS scene, we should probably not bother with a low-level one. \n\nI would start from:\n\n* Lisbon Council as coordinator\n* T6 for the MORRI stuff\n* Glimps and CCL for hands-on citizen science\n* City of Gent or Flemish govt for policy\n* EDGE for SSNA\n* U Aalborg as academic ethno partner\n* U Gent as academic _design_ partner. Alternative: POLIMI, provided we can get to work with a more senior person.\n\nA couple of the partners would be new (even U Gent, as Chiara has left.

If Open Insulin is still on, I would recommend @dfko, Ramy and Winnie to look into it. I am not sure there is much room for direct EDGE involvement, though.\n* SwafS-23, 29 and 30 are all about ethics, accountability and integrity. We are in principle interested in working on those issues. We perceive a huge problem of research accountability and data integrity in the humanities. I would love to discuss this issue with @markomanka and Antonella, and see if we come up with something.\n* SwafS-31 is an \"open\" topic. I would like to propose a very radical experiment of deeply collaborative, decentralized citizen ethnography \u2013 a \"lean and mean\" version of our old RECODE project, with some resources committed on developing a tool that *really* supports collaboration. I see a role for @akmunk, and of course @amelia.

So we went to two regions EL KEF wich is in the north and GAFSA in the south , we did workshops for the women handcrafters on marketing , branding and an initiation to product design so they develop the habit of innovation..  \nAfterwards we co-conceived a new collection of products that transfigure these technics into creative products dedicated to the international market, and we got such a good feedback when we exhibited them in the Tunisian international handcrafts show. \n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c773f9bf07f2123fe6ce3036a2dbbfd51f483e39.png\" width=\"397\" height=\"265\">\n\nThis experience shifted my way of thinking about product design which was more industrial targeted due to my university studies. \nI sensed how all of the African continent has this huge cultural heritage that is endangered due to the fact that it is not well represented or used . \nAnd that\u2019s when TANDA came in, which means \u201c Diversity \u201c in Tamazight language this project of mine was birthed in the tunisian handicrafts show where I exhibited my first product wich was a new jewelry design that uses the ancestral AMAZIGH weaving technics mixed with copper and silver , something that was never done in Tunisia before. This work was done with two women handcrafters that I got to know when I was working with the GIZ. \n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1109b0c5fb2670f5c21682fc1c7784e1baebb827.png\" width=\"623\" height=\"440\">\n\nAnd from that I carried on to giving my project this mission : \u201c PRESERVATION AND MODERNISATION OF THE AFRICAN HANDICRAFTS HERITAGE\u201d to make this sector one of the main pillars of the African economical empowerment. \n\n\n## How?\n \nThe approach will be to gather a team composed prematurely mainly of designers, an editor and a video maker/editor, target each year a country and go on an immersive 3-6 months co-living experience with the handcrafters there and co-conceive new products with them dedicated to themed hotels, hostels , guest houses restaurants , lounges , concept stores etc \u2026 any kind of space that seeks african themed design or architecture.  \n\nA Part of the income will go to the handcrafters themselves in the form of royalties to boost their production capability, engage and help them in creating their own startups. \n\nThe result will be a plate-forme containing a digital archive holding EVERY bit of information about the african handcrafts history , a  museum and shop In which you can see that every ancestral and modern product from every African country has a story to tell and a legacy to give. \n\nWe will  be the link that will connect the local heritage producers ( handcrafters ) to designers for the innovation of contemporary authentic products, provide the visibility ( products / handicrafts shows , an annual show to the experience itself ) and the economical support  that will insure the African heritage to reach the global market  with Africans themselves getting the income they deserve out of it .\n\nAll along my stay in sidi kaouki's open-village, While discussing the subject with  @matthias  i had this idea about an annual handicraft oriented open-village experience that will include the TANDA project in countries all across africa.\n\nThen i thought about cocluding the immersive 3-6 months co-living co-designing experience in each country with a \"space\"  all designed with the \" modernisation of the handicraft heritage \" of that country ( architecture , interior design , furniture etc...) , this space would provide a  handicraft workshops and activities to tourists the mentors will be basically the local artisans themselves and one or two designers.\n\nI also discussed the project with @natalia_skoczylas and she helped me a lot in finding contests or grants for african entrepreneurship.  \n\nOnce i got back home to Tunisia i started seeking out ways to concretize this project and i started by following the advise of @anique.yael wich was to first start connecting with local partners through existing or recently completed projects and so i did. \n\nHe's one of the colaborators who worked with us in the Giz Project stated previously, The deal with him would be to get Funds for the project with his NGO since he has a lot of expertise in this , just to speed up the process and to start the project in tunisia and i go indpendent when it grows bigger and he has conexions with a canadian funded accelerator that was interested in the project he's asking for a BMC That i almost have finished withe help of @islem .\n\nAny kind of help and feedback is appreciated.", "created_at": "2018-05-28 13:31:10.879903", "updated_at": "2019-01-15 20:39:59.054312", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 812, "wiki": false, "reads": 25, "score": 450.0, "like_count": 9, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4267, 5, 137, 3782, 3826, 3904, 1935, 2569, 4085], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16372, "user_id": 128, "topic_id": 1475, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Nice ryde !</b>\n\nYour story is reall inspiring.\n\nYou prove that, when you care about people around you, everything makes sense.\u00a0And the more you help things get better, the better you are and feel.\n\nThere's something amazing about your story, it's how one person succeeded to involve others, and quickly to find others strenghts and willings.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDo you know\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.projectnoah.org/\">http://www.projectnoah.org</a>\u00a0?\n\nI'd like to get this project running in the high school I work in, but after talking to teachers, it appears it would be quite difficult to do.

We understand you have been involved in a project called __________; based on that, we thought maybe you are considering it too. In that case, we wonder if you would consider us as a partner.\n\nUnlike you, we are not domain experts on populism. Our contribution to a proposal to the \"Understanding populism\" topic would be a work package to build a very large scale ethnographic study that would uncover what populist societal dynamics looks like to populists themselves, and to those on the receiving end of it. This could be used to illuminate and validate the hypotheses produced by domain experts like you.  \n\nWe can do this based on a novel method called Semantic Social Network Analysis. The main idea is to foster an online conversation; perform ethnographic coding on it; then use graph theory and some software to build a network of ethnographic codes that represent the conversation. You can think of it as a collective mental map of the problem at hand. This comes with a filtering technique that allows human researchers to make sense of even very large graphs, with thousands of contributions and ethnographic codes. \n\nIf this sounds interesting, let me know.

Briefly to be explained, that the bank will have a partly ownership of a certain percentage of the production of the investor company ,& then issue a discount card (coupons), and this ratio is determined depending on the nature and value of the loan, for example: The company (A) which has the production of goods (P) has borrowed from the bank the amount of 1000000 $ ,so, the company will give the bank the right to deal with part of the company's production of this goods which is (for Example) 10% of the production of the goods for a number of goods (N) or for a period of time (T) depending on the specific agreement \nThe bank does this with a number of borrowing companies and then , the bank issue the discount cards (coupons), which contains the discount on every product and part of it is distributed to depositors  according to their desire and the value of  their deposit,& then  make a production of a handbook to clarify (catalog) of the goods and products from companies dealing with the bank. \nFor example, someone deposited a certain amount in the bank, so, he will be handed over the catalog to choose which discounted goods he wants, and he takes discount cards for a number of products matching with the amount of his balance in the bank and the period of pay deposit for it.\n\u2022\t**Second Idea (Money sharing Rotation**)\nFor borrowers who do not intend to invest the loan money as some people may need money to pay off debts or for marriage or study or buy some something for example, or any circumstance ...How could the Bank help them then?\nThe answer is the (association cooperation sharing system) it\u2019s a kind of round of money a way to fund-raising help of some individuals to Each other, however, that each of them pays a certain amount of money monthly and have a turn in the receipt of funds, meaning every one of them will pay amount of money to the bank & the bank collect them every month & one of the sharers get the collected money in turn by rotation , the bank also could take part as a sharer in one or many turns , for examples we have 10 people need money every one needs 10000 dollars so everyone will pay to the bank every month 1000 and every month one of them will gain the money 10*1000 = 100000 , customer (1) in January , customer (2) in February , customer(3) in march , \u2026. & so on  & for more justice every one could have two turns like customer (1) take the first turn & the last turn , customer (2) take the second & the 9th  turn \u2026. & so on, & every time, the more number of sharers increase, the more gain for everyone.<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/1/13e34ffa0d984814d1345fceebda35bf4ad5a83e.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"320\">\n\n\n**Third Idea : Free currency** \nrelative Stability of value or the relative stability of the purchasing power of the amount of the money in the bank (which is very similar to the rule of gold) But with some differences \n\nThe sense that if we look at the interest we will find that it consists of two types of interest or that it consists of two parts the interest , first part is to cover the inflation caused by the passage of time & inflation , and the second part is the profit of the bank which is the difference between the interest of lending and borrowing \nTherefore, the relative stability of purchasing power is dealing with the first part of interest.\nSo, that when someone of the depositor puts money in the bank ,the amount of the  money is be evaluated according to matching precious metal as assessment like gold price for example , or according to something of lasting value or less vulnerable to fluctuations like fixed global currency to measure the value of deposits by this currency but transfer it to the local currency during the Banking transactions , fixed global currency can't be affected by any economy problems of any country because it doesn't depend on any country , it can't be changed by changing the other currencies all over the world . it must be stable. \nFor example....Suppose that someone had put 100000 USD in the bank, let\u2019s say that the price of gold in grams according to the current time, equal to20 $.... Then the value set by the Bank equal to 5000 grams ... and then the man comes after a period of time, ten years..(for example), to take back his money &withdraw his funds transfer from the bank ,& let\u2019s  say that the price of gram of gold at that time equal to 25 dollar, So due to the depositor the deserved money is 5000 * 25, or equal to 125000 $, which represents his account balance in the bank at this time , & the earned money equals 125000 \u2013 100000 = 25000profit.\nSome sub-items of complementary\n\u2022\tDiscount notices\nall outlets selling the goods produced by the supplier Shall be notified of discount cards to be collected and delivered to the supplier until it reaches the extent of the amount required and that each of the card with the discount received from the bank handed over to the seller - which in turn delivers them to the supplier - to get the discount on goods he buy.\n\n\u2022\tMarketing\nMaking Explanation booklets(catalogs) containing all the goods and services which the Bank is dealing with not only of goods but also services such as hospitals, doctors , dentists ,pharmacies , laboratories , offices like accounting offices, engineering offices, and legal lawyers offices and other services.\n The Bank sells part of discount cards to non- depositors to gain his profit\nThe difference between golden Bank and other banks \nThe difference between golden bank and the other Banks is about the interest because it reverses the interest& transfers it to discount and that has many benefits that will be explained.\n**The benefits of the Bank**\nMany advantages of the bank for each of money owners and investors, and even for the whole society.\n**The advantages of the bank for depositors**\n\u2022\tthe prices of Goods at the Golden Bank are acceptable because of the discounts and are not too expensive as the other banks due to the interests on it which the investor is forced to raise the price of the Goods to compensate for cost and repay the loan and interest \n\u2022\t  ... Even if an increase of prices happens in general as a result of inflation or something , all clients dealing with the bank make good use of discounts &don\u2019t be affected by price changing - whether the buyer of discount cards or depositor\u2013the point  is that the high price of the product leads to a rise in the value of the discount ... \nFor example: to suppose that a Commodity price of 100 $ and the discount rate is 10%, then the amount of discount 100 * 10% = 10 $, then, the commodity price have been risen to 120 pounds in this case, the amount of discount value equal to 120 * 10% = 12 $, that means that the increased value of the discount by 2 pounds, & that depositor also have been benefited\n**The advantages of the bank for investors**\n\u2022\tThe golden bank gives a great assistance to help the investor in all types of goods & services and all production stages processes, from the starting process of establishing the company because in process of construction and at the beginning of the product life cycle where the increasing costs and lack of profit, which is almost equal to zero, if not actually less, if we suppose the existence of the interests costs plus it, that make it worse-& that leads the investor to one of three choices, either the investor stops the production for the payment of interests and be forced to end the company - and thus ended the life cycle of the product before it starts - or increases the price to increase his profit so as he could repay the loan and interest, which leads to a decline in demand for goods as a result of the high price \n\u2022\t<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6ed8006b7f06b8e9a429fde8936e15964a4a94a6.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"517\">\n\u2022\tThis is not only for the  starting company which may be at the beginning ,but it is also happens to the company that already has reached the stage of decay, which forces them to variety their activities and expand the area of marketing so as they could continue.\n\u2022\tAnother important point of the marketing  , when the company be at the beginning of its life it faces great difficulties  by the terrible competition between it and the other big companies, it will be like a baby between beasts and that child needs the support to take his first steps in the adult world - where  the big companies have the experience and reputation which the small investor misses , beside the habituation of society to their goods which would be difficult to replace it with alternative goods from other new investor which is unknown, forcing the small investor stick to the market prices & maybe less than them - in spite of the large production costs - to attract consumers who may already have gotten used to the products of other big companies \n\u2022\t Also a very important advantage which is the marketing of products by the catalogs and discount coupons that make the dealers with the bank, both of depositors and the discount cards buyers make good use of the discount cards to buy such goods even for try. Discount makes it easy, especially the price of the commodity will be less with the discount, gives opportunity to try it more.\nThe advantages of the bank for the community \n\u2022\tIncreasing investment and to encouraging direct investment and to giving opportunities for owners of small and large projects to achieve their ideas and enrich the community \n\u2022\tstrengthening the relationship between the depositors and investors and between them and the projects and products, making each individual feel his role in the development and being main element&part of the production wheel\n\u2022\t Giving the bank the function of  marketing as well as funding, as many of the new projects need to  marketing \n\u2022\tReduction of inflation may even we can say reverse it as it turnover the  interest which is the cause of increasing prices and turn it into a discount  that leads to lower commodity prices \n\u2022\tInvestors will do their best to improve the quality of their goods so as to increase the demand for increasing the sold  quantity of goods, which speed up the period of the discount end as a result of finishing the discount amount \n\u2022\tElimination of the interest and the side effects upon the output \n\u2022\tPrevents the money owners from relying on interests which leads to lazy being, &dependence on others without work or any effort.\n\u2022\tEncourages the money owners who do not have ideas to put their money in the bank.\n\u2022\tReduction of unemployment and encouraging the owners of ideas and projects to achieve their projects and using their wasted powers\n\u2022\tDevelopment of social capital as the spread of unemployment lead to a rise in crime due to the lost time and lack of material resources of the poor \n\u2022\tThe development of intellectual capital due to encouraging young people and owners of new ideas to achieve it instead of keeping it left and lost in a world of imagination \n\u2022\tThe

The residency was slow paced, but some work - and certainly some dreams - became strongly rooted in my mind. I have slept many nights over Sofien\u2019s proposal and asked if he\u2019d like some help. Luckily, he did - and soon after, I ended up being selected for one-year-long studies for cultural entrepreneurs, where various European organizations that specialize in supporting or developing sustainable art projects will be helping participants to work on their proposals and bring them to life. Zuza Koszuta from Czu\u0142o\u015b\u0107, a successful and acclaimed art gallery from Poland which selected me, told me there will be a guy from MIT that focuses on creative platforms as one of the mentors. I don\u2019t know his name, but platforms and arts - that\u2019s enough to turn me on. \n\nWe had a call today with @Sofien-Dahem, during which we discussed where the project is heading now, what are the future steps, and how do we collaborate on it to make it into a solid business sometime soon. In this post, I\u2019ll try to explain what is the idea and what are the challenges ahead of us. This also means a lot of questions to the collective brain of our community and a call for criticism, advice, and support. \n\nSome time ago Sofien took part in a small-scale project that documented some of the traditional crafts in Tunisia and matched the artisans with contemporary designers. The project didn\u2019t last very long, but the idea captured him. He told me about his dream of creating a repository of documentation of traditional crafts from Africa, which would consist of multiple layers:\n\nA digital archive and a museum where materials preserving the traditional methods would be collected. The first comprehensive space of its kind, and a viable source of information for people interested in traditional craftsmanship. It would also have a database of traditional artisans, informing about their skills and history as producers. \nAn online shop in which you can find the collection of the modern African handcraft products result of the annual co-living co-design experience between the designers and the handcrafters\nA learning platform for people who would like to acquire specific skills presented on the page. This also includes educational materials and games for schools interested in including this kind of knowledge in their curriculums. Including tools that would make the learning fun and tangible - weaving kits for example. And it also involves access to high-quality materials explaining the crafts from various points of view - historical, ethnographic, anthropological - available also as a research material. We could for example offer payable access to 3d models of artifacts to researchers willing to investigate a very niche craft somewhere in Tunisia. \nA space for contemporary designers, hackers, makers, and artisans to work together on new products that would combine the traditional knowledge and traditional skills\nA space That provides handcrafts workshops for tourists.\nOffline workshops and master classes in these crafts\nProduction space dedicated to hotels, hostels, and other spaces searching for the unique design that could be provided based on this network.\n\nThe idea is huge and possibly in the future, it could encompass other continents as the first of its kind archive of traditional skills in the world. \n\nWe have a lot of question marks here, which possibly some of you could help us address:\n\n**What kind of business/ nonprofit entity should this project be based on, and where?** \nWe\u2019re considering having multiple offices - one in Tunisia, as the government is now working on regulations that will support startup owners with funds. It would also allow us to pay one of the members for a longer period of time - in this case Sofien, and possibly someone else from Tunisia who\u2019d like to join in. There is also Estonia, with its e-residency that would allow us to access both European market and funds. And other places, maybe Germany - with its generous funds and booming design scene. \n\n**What kind of team do we need?** \n\nFor now, we determined that the idea has to include a wide range of skilled members, such as \nProject manager and lead - Sofien\nContent manager/editorial head and a community/partnership builder - possibly me\nvideo makers and editors - I have a great contact in Denmark, but we\u2019d probably need much more if the project flies\n3d modeling specialists \nDesigners\nIT specialist, web developer and a person responsible for maintaining the database\nHistorians, anthropologists, and ethnographers who\u2019d investigate and explain the objects, motifs, ideas behind the traditional arts\nArtisans\n\n**What kind of resources do we need?**\n\nCameras, computers, microphones, editing programs\nRaw materials to produce the objects\nSpaces where workshops and meetings could be held\nIn-depth research about the methods of documenting various methods of production - what tools do we use, how do we ensure a holistic approach? What are the concerns technical difficulties, philosophical questions here? \n\n**Where can we get funds for the project?**\n\nThe program I will be participating in has a module which focuses on funding opportunities. Besides, we\u2019re investigating other options to get the initial funding for the project, and for now, we have found a couple of sources - but we very much welcome your ideas here as well. \n\nSofien is applying to Safirlab.com - Francophone long-term project that supports startups from MENA region with knowledge and funding\nCreating a unique museum of this kind might get support from Google - I saw a presentation from CyArk from Oakland, California who collaborate on a very unique, high-quality documentation of historical sites all around the globe, which made me think of a possibility of working together with them (although I am also concerned about partnering with the evil monopoly) \n\nThe colleague of Sofien has offered help with fundraising from sources known to him in the Netherlands that could support the early stage of development of the project\n\nAll of these questions are open, and I am well aware that a lot of the questions haven\u2019t even been asked yet. I\u2019d be grateful for your insights and comments. And of course we invite possible collaborators to the table - I\u2019m thinking of @matteo_uguzzoni  for the gamification/educational part, @Noemi, @mariekebelle  and @anique.yael for their criticism and ideas, as well as possible involvement, @Matthias, and @alex_levene to pitch in as well. And everyone else who find this project interesting, possibly as their own baby in the future.

If you can\u2019t get a one day immersion in an actual monastery, then maybe immersion for a weekend prototyping the unMonastery approach (working &amp; living together). Giving people the chance to experience the change before September seems to be really important, as no doubt the first few days of living the unMonastery way will be psychologically intense for people, as it\u2019s a new way of living (remember your first day at school, your first flatshare, etc).

That also means for us that (1) we can probably ignore UV, and (2) it's a good idea to include infrared imaging relatively early. So in addition to the white LED flasher we plan to use, we'd also include flashing infrared LEDs, and prepare the camera for near-infrared imaging by removing some filter \u2026\n\n[quote=\"markomanka, post:14, topic:8086\"]He stressed how also camera positioning takes them quite a deal of optimisation when changing targets and work cycle ... so maybe thinking of setting your own detectors on a movable frame[/quote]\n\nInteresting data point as well.

No thinking of integrating the whole community\n**Hajeur**: \nThe background of the society: we are a new society that is trying to discover itself, we havethe origin of Bedouins, so even the bureaucratic of this region is new, we still have a weird communication style, and the tribes mentality is taking control over the city.. we need to work on the civil society ,because it is helping us to communicate more\u2026 this is why we don\u2019t know how to share, because we don\u2019t really understand each other: My card: I am not able to choose one over one, but I will talk about economy because we need more investments, and the government\u2019s attention over that. Culture which is important for me, it is sharing and knowing how to communicate, and separate objectivity from subjectivity, focus on communication, and create a balanced economy, and culture where we need to know how to co-live with our own selves\u2026\n**Nidhal**: \nThe mentality in Medenine misses the innovation, you will always have someone giving negative comments; we only repeat each other\u2019s ideas, and second: we lack good communication skills \nbecause in such an opportunity, such as this workshop, we are enabled to discover each other, since we are used to judging other people without even knowing them, but then we are here, talking to each other and learning new things...\n**Ines**:\nThe problematic in Medenine is the lack of entertainment tools, we only work and study and that is how we spend our lives, with nothing in between... even if there was a culutural movement in the society lately, it still missing a lot of work! People now don\u2019t understand what is the civil society about, they don\u2019t understand the procedures followed by the associations ( People don\u2019t trust them, they only ask what political party they belong to\u2026 ) also the media is affecting in a dirty way the image of the associations, and people don\u2019t know the volunteering, they only think of the financial output of it.. (Nejib interrupts: people don\u2019t know how to do it in the first place ..) (Ali interrupts: we want a small output out of it, and not necessarily money but some acknowledgment is enough, and most of the civil society doesn't do that) and I chose personal activities and initiatives card: when we ask our colleagues to volunteer they refuse to do so, they don\u2019t want to take initiatives.. also the activities in the volunteering has a huge impact over the human being, when seeing its procedure of how it is helping people (Anes interuupts: It changes the way we see things\uf04a\n**Mohamed**: \nInformation exchange card: the world now is based on information so we need to know which information we need and which we don\u2019t, and how to share it.\nTransparency card: people don\u2019t know how to be transparent with each other and neither with theirselves, we envy each other and we don\u2019t communicate!\nEmployment and work card: I am unemployed since two years, I want to learn how to work and be professional! and if I didn\u2019t find a job I will launch my business...\n\n**Haykel**:\nI chose my card without thinking of anyone else but myself,  when I finished my university, I had no activities to do because we have nothing that we can do in Medenine except for working and studying ...so I wanted to change that and I thought of taking part of what is happening and I started an association with my friends where we met a lot of people from Medenine, and foreign ones, we were moving all over the world, and we were doing a great job, but in Medenine we were called different bad names and we had different insults\u2026 but I learned from that! and then I felt I have enough knowledge and skills in multimedia and audio-visuals (my field of studies), as I always participate in different workshops in all over Tunisia, (I pay for getting knowledge and I am happy for that and I shared my knowledge unlike the people in here who don\u2019t want to share such things usually!)  and with the help of some friends, I got different opportunities, and the biggest one was: Souk Altanmia, it gave me a fund...  and I started my project, and the actual work od the project started from the community I had from the civil society\u2026\nHowever, at a certain time I stopped working on civil society because it was all over the place and we had a lot of them since 2013! there were a lot of associations that are ineffective ones ... ( we had some who were professionals, and it was good, but then it turned into a business \u2026 ) during this time, I started to participate in programs that reinforce my skills and capacity .. and now we are working on creating our  real new association that works on entrepreneurship, culture and art.\n**Zaineb**:\nI also thought of myself: I chose the family, friends, relationships, self improvement.\nFamily and friends are my major support; as for the self-improvement is about how to change myself to change our reality \nI can relate to all what they have said, but the most important thing for me is the will to change the city and the country and I do believe that we can.\n**Anes  ( only 16 years! )**\nI want to discover new things and hear what people think, I want to be present in everything, in the high school there is an average demand for such workshops and activities, I discovered the civil society myself and I loved to participate in it, but my family want me to focus on my studies.\nThe time I have now it will never be back! so I want to learn as much as I can.\n\n**My reflection about the workshop in Medenine**\nSo I was happily surprised because the rain was so heavy, and there was some small floods in the streets that makes it super hard for people to move from a place to another, but then people came even in this weather... and they really made a huge effort to come! I appreciated that a lot.\nIt was an emotional one, the most emotional workshop in Tunisia, and it was different because we got in the deep thinking and tackled the sensitive issues for the youth of Medenine.\nAll of the people in the workshop were people I know, except for one, and I can say that this was the most honest discussion they have ever made while talking to someone in a workshop, maybe because ofthe methodology followed by @Nadia maybe, it engaged people from the start.\nWhat was common for all the people in the room, is that WE ARE HERE, we want to change the situation in Medenine, because it is not fair for us to not be given opportunities that you easily find in other regions of the country.\nMost of the people talked about the communication, they mentionned  the non ability for the youth in here to communicate correctly, because we don't communicate often, and that is what they loved about the workshop, they were TALKING to each other and saying everything they think about, and COMMUNICATING in a very passionate way.\nMost of them complainced about the severe lack of activities that we can do in here, it is as I saidin my story, people has nothing in between job and school to do, the life in here is passive and full of deadly routine, there is no space for innovation and mental productivity.\nThe importance of the civil society in here, since it is the only thing that helps them to be an active citizen.\nwhat I loved the most and captured me the most is that people were talking with passion about what we can do in Medenine, it wasn't like individual perspectives and projects like the case in Monastir and Tunis! But it was more about what we can do to HELP Medenine.\nI was always told by @Nadia and @Zmorda that I am so in love with Medenine, but then after this workshop I think it is obvious that most of the people in here are so in love with it.", "created_at": "2017-10-03 22:59:30.864802", "updated_at": "2017-10-04 00:02:38.385933", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1879, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 263.6, "like_count": 8, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 1935, 4, 4085, 4088, 3729, 8, 4094], "is_private": false}, {"id": 71108, "user_id": 6333, "topic_id": 7122, "post_number": 64, "raw": "The coffee we grow here in Kona is among the best ( and most expensive ) in the world:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kona_coffee\n\nThere are a ton of small hold farms up here on Hualalai earning a living by growing great coffee on 5 acres or less.", "created_at": "2020-03-09 23:55:18.461731", "updated_at": "2020-03-09 23:55:18.461731", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 47, "wiki": false, "reads": 21, "score": 59.2, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [70873], "is_liked_by": [8, 5, 2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 37430, "user_id": 3812, "topic_id": 7244, "post_number": 3, "raw": "I really loved this comment, thank you! so yes..

As some of the projects we have been building together mature and take flight, it is important that there is consensus around rules guiding our choices moving forward.\n\nAn example here is that of the unMonastery.\n\nRecently I received an email asking whether I wished to become a shareholder in a new organisation run by a mix of community members and others, wishing to work on unMonastery(ies). The reason stated for my being offered the share is that I have put in a significant amount of work into the project. After the unMonastery presence at Transmediale, I have been approached by community members upset because they have not been consulted about this development in spite of having made contributions to the project's development.\n\nEdgeryders is a massive experiment in distributed organisaton structures, and the way we learn is by raising issues and addressing them in an open, collaborative manner. So I am flagging it as a case study.\n\nI think there are two questions that need to be discussed:\n\n1) Does it matter that everyone who feels they have contributed towards the building of the unMonastery (or any community born project) is consulted about this move, and or feels invited to be part of the new organisation? If so, how to ensure this happens? (<em>Bear in mind that everyone has limited time and resources, so it needs to be practically actionable under those conditions).</em>\n\n2) Is a version of a community project run by a new organisation or using new processes a fork? If so does it make sense for the new projects and or organisation to be named in a way that indicates this is the case?\n\nWhat do you think? Comments welcome below.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-03-10 13:03:33", "updated_at": "2018-05-28 16:36:31.543984", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 405, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 6.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [145], "is_private": false}, {"id": 37434, "user_id": 4082, "topic_id": 7223, "post_number": 7, "raw": "Hello!

Firstly, I dont think the majority of young Irish people have been spurred in to action. They are currently very dissillusioned with society. The Celtic Tiger promoted an ideal that places value on material wealth and the Irish people subscribed to that ideal. That ideal failed completely and as such it has been hard for the youth to deal with this. Our political and economic system failed us totally and we have not yet found our identity (I could talk for a very long time about Irish identity, our past, our language and other historic factors such as the colonisation but I will stick to the topic). Also, the youth are not being engaged by our social system and as such they are not engaging with society. There are a lot of young Irish people who have strong opinions and ideas but the majority do not act upon them.\n\nThis is a very complex dynamic!\n\n2. The people making a difference are passionate, friendly, they enjoy the simple things in life and they enjoy meeting new people, they are kind-hearted, however, they are not professionals and they often require a lot of advice and guidance in order to make their projects or ideas a success. They act upon local issues. They identify local needs or problems and they come up with solutions to solve or ease the problem. Only lately is the infrastructure emerging to connect and support these individuals, examples include socialentrepreneurs.ie who run networking events and are working to develop a structured network. Social Entrepreneurs Ireland are another organisation, they are a philanthropic body that offer substantial financial and advisory support to ten projects/individuals a year, they also have a youth project called Wave Change, of which I am a part.\n\nFeel free to challenge any of that or ask me further questions :)\n\n\u00a0\n\nR\u00f3n\u00e1n.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-02-13 11:47:34", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:47.997881", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 343, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 65061, "user_id": 2551, "topic_id": 11634, "post_number": 23, "raw": "[quote=\"kravietz, post:21, topic:11634\"]\nPoland\u2019s precarious situation is 100% responsibility of its populist government\n[/quote]\n\n\nThat is also bullshit.

This is in spite of clear evidence that nuclear waste does not and will not cause harm to sustainability objectives. Nuclear energy displaces fossil fuel use, with significant air pollution and climate benefits. Without nuclear, there will be 500m tonnes of extra CO2 emissions every year in Europe, which is more than the emissions of UK or France alone. Without nuclear, our action on climate will be more difficult, more expensive, and more likely to fail. The real harm done will be to Europe\u2019s ambition to achieve net zero by 2050.", "created_at": "2019-12-17 11:23:50.896909", "updated_at": "2019-12-17 11:23:50.896909", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 156, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 6.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 75082, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 13292, "post_number": 10, "raw": "how's your fasting going @jasen_lakic \ud83d\ude08", "created_at": "2020-04-25 19:10:48.413869", "updated_at": "2020-04-25 19:10:48.413869", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 6, "wiki": false, "reads": 35, "score": 17.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [75081], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 86401, "user_id": 3206, "topic_id": 13292, "post_number": 190, "raw": "Yeah and I don't get why is it still done like this.

Unfortunately, the crisis has brought down many small businesses and is forcing entrepreneurs to rethink their approaches. In this virtual session we learn about different Belgian niche food initiatives and the personal struggles & possibilities they are going through right now. While focused on Belgium, this session is a good case study for the broader edgeryders network, with members from over 30 countries.\nWe would like to discuss but not limit ourselves to the following :\n* which mindsets can help us limit losses? what kind of solutions are being tried? are there success stories amidst struggle?\n* is localisation something which can improve resilience on a societal level? will it be able to feed the whole table? is this model based on time (or burnout!) and higher quality scale-able to the whole society? \n* how can cooperative structures? or other new ways?\n* ...your own questions.\n\n\n# Format & practical information\n\n* A few invited participants will open the conversation and share their experiences. After that, anyone who is present can tell about their project and engage in the discussion, learn how others are dealing with challenges and what strategies are working.\n* Who is this session for? People who are passionate about food - farming, production, delivery, cooking, serving. Participants are invited to join and share personal experiences. Bring the questions that haunt you! \n* Language: English, French and Dutch with translation by others when needed\n\n# Who else should join the session? Here are some initiatives we wish to learn from:\n\n* [CoopCycle](https://coopcycle.org/en/) - a food delivery app for courier and restaurateur coops. Discussion [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/list-of-interesting-initiatives-to-feature-at-the-summit-on-resilient-livelihoods/13300/3).\n* Enstoemelivery, \n* Home Gourmet\n* CoopCity and a producer owned distribution coop\n* [PlantEd](https://www.facebook.com/plantedvzw/) - Non-profit for education and catering with plant based foods.\n* hummus x hortense: plant based restaurant in Brussels; they offered to be a pickup point for vegetable baskets brought by the farmer that they work with, at no commission! nowadays, like most restaurants they do meals delivery, until the Horeca sector reopens in Belgium.\n* Freddy met Curry: sustainable meal delivery and a new startup in Brussels.\n\n# Discussion points\n\nA Case Study\n* Yannick's personal approach: breaking apart each piece of the business, cutting back & not wanting to restart the machine. For example, starting a food business that is taking off, wanting to grow and roll out new opportunities & \u201cprofessionalization\u201d of the whole enterprise. Loss of 95% of the revenue once the covid crisis goes full throttle. Now: looking into a much more artistic / social organization structure of the project. I don\u2019t want to put food and business in the same basket anymore. Food projects should be possible within a social approach. So i\u2019m cutting of most of my growth potential, selecting just a few gigs to be able to pay the costs. Cutting back on the loop: more demand -> more investments -> more costs -> needing more clients -> more demands\u2026\nWhat types of mindsets do you have to overcome the crisis within the craft food industriy: \u201cle capital sympathie\u201d, minimizing losses, business as usual, going social?\n\nAn important question we also have is:\n* How to organise your project around the value of having 'local products'? this seems to be the game changing opportunity for food projects: local is an added value. Does this actually influence the consumer behavior or is it another greenwashing terminology but no real change?

We continue our series of meetups to figure out how we can get better at building community spaces in the city, in sustainable ways. In the previous culture Culture meetups in May and June we learned about collective access to space, from @yannick, @rmdes, @KatrienR; about why the groups inhabiting and working there have difficulties creating permanent resources, from @Emmanuel @camtesta and others; about the need to build for permanence and actual ownership: we presented The Reef, a new community initiative in Brussels.\n\n**On October 11th we will learn about the underused resource of Brussels: space! and how to use it to build more social, cultural, environmental utility around it.** \n\nOver 6 million m2 in this city are not creating any value. La 20\u1d49 Commune St-Vide- Leegbeek is a collective advocacy effort where many organisations involved in temporary occupations are fighting for change. Read their [manifesto here.](https://www.leegbeek.brussels/about)\n\nOur conversation opener is Isabelle N'diaye @baobaburbain, an urban planner passionate about how different parts of the ecosystem can come together to fix issues. She will present the efforts of St-Vide-Leegbeek so far and insights into how to go forward in what she calls 'viable articulations': reaffirm that transitory urbanism is a pragmatic tool that ensure access to spaces and open them for projects with multiple utilities. The next step for St-Vide-Leegbeek is figure out how to model these partnerships between spaces and projects, and make them jump from handcraft to something more sophisticated and economically fruitful.\n\n## Format:\n\n1. Short introduction by Isabelle\n\n2. Open conversation: each participant brings in their own experience and asks questions to the room to get feedback or support for their own work.\n\n3. Follow up: each participant shares their reflection on the community platform. This ensures we can build continuity and share learnings with others: http://edgeryders.eu/c/culture-squad\n\n## Place and time:\n\n18:00 - 20:00 [La Buissonni\u00e8re](https://www.facebook.com/labuissoniere21/) in St Gilles. After we wrap up we go and have drinks at La Vieille Chechette, a nice social cooperative cafe across the street.\n\n## Register:\n\nIf you&rsquo;re interested to learn, contribute experience and advice, join us!

I wasn't aware of the Earth OS branch of Edgeryders or the Climate-KIC partnership, which I think is absolutely brilliant.\n\nRegarding Irish carbon pricing, we are reaching the end of a two-year process that began in a national Citizen's Assembly and moved to a cross-party parliamentary committee. Last march that committee agreed on an ambitious programme of climate action - with the exception of carbon tax. There is a meeting of that committee next week in a final attempt at consensus on carbon tax. Whatever happens at the meeting the process will then go behind the closed doors of the Department of Finance, with the details being announced in the national budget at the end of October. As it stands, the governing party, the Greens and a few others are supporting the return of revenue as some sort of dividend, with serious opposition from one major party and vague, \"see which way the wind blows\" opposition from another. Through my vehicle/role as 'National Coordinator' of Citizens' Climate Lobby Ireland I've met with all the main political parties, spoken in an information briefing at the Irish parliament, engaged with the environmental NGOs, media and other actors and stakeholders, and tweeted (@CCLIreland), written and talked. Now we'll see. \n\nCanada has already implemented a carbon dividend, so Ireland would be second (although Canada would lose it's carbon pricing if the Conservatives win an October election). Carbon pricing has to rise into the \u20ac'00's over the next decade, and IMHO (and that of many, many others) the only politically possible way to do this is by returning revenue and thus ensuring that a voting majority financially gain. Ireland is vitally important in this effort because if we can get a clear, clean, unambiguous example of a politically acceptable price on carbon here it would be a model for the EU and beyond - and especially France, where there is growing movement in this direction. The core idea is that if people are getting real net cash in their pockets from carbon pricing, then they'll vote for more of it.\n\nIn regard to potential projects, I am open to talking to and working with anybody as long as the goal is action towards paid work on carbon and climate. I have both a deep and current knowledge and a coherent overall perspective of the climate/money/politics space (i.e., policy transition risk), and I'm a fast, evidence-focused and auto didactic learner. Previous projects involved everything from offsets to F-gases, but the place I would like to be is teaching asset and risk managers and corporate executives about climate, carbon, and the risks (and opportunities) of climate change and the carbon transition. Basically I want to help them think about climate and carbon.\n\nThat's the passion. The practice is initially offering 1/2 to 2-day training/education courses and consulting on carbon and climate. Topics include climate change, the International policy response, carbon pricing, etc. (see  http://carbontide.com/modules.pdf). And maybe consulting help with TCFD and related disclosure and with scenario analysis. Future avenues of growth include expanding the topics covered by involving expertise to cover all areas of climate risk (physical as well as transition - and perhaps other environmental areas), and publishing high-end and expensive reports and newsletters. My evidence-based belief and prediction is that this area is going to grow explosively in the years ahead, as the reality of our climate situation sinks in and as governments, regulators and customers act accordingly. However adequate that movement is, my contention is that it will move markets and dramatically alter asset values across sectors.\n\nAlthough I've had a few carbon-related contracts I'm just beginning to market the courses. After a few years focused on non-paying politics I'm hungry for money, and this business aligns that hunger with my passion for climate and emissions reduction. I have previous start-up and investor experience (failed, but educational) and substantial small business experience, so this is not my first rodeo. Apart from my specialist knowledge (and network) I have substantial experience in education and training across several domains. Skills where I'm weak are sales and administration, and important experience that I'm lacking is direct experience inside the financial sector.\n\nI'm looking for contracts, looking for work, and looking for jobs, and I'd be delighted to talk to anybody along those lines or, indeed, to explore any other opportunities. If any more specific ideas occur to me I'll post them.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nGraham\n\n-- \nGraham Caswell\n\nCarbon Tide\nContext for the Carbon Transition\nwww.CarbonTide.com\n+353-(0)85-1656675", "created_at": "2019-09-10 16:07:19.784135", "updated_at": "2019-09-10 16:07:19.784135", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 794, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 47.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18613, "user_id": 2551, "topic_id": 757, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>First world problems, first world opportunities...</b>\n\nThere are heaps of literature how this splintering and individualization of society allows for a reorganization that allows modern industrial society to operate much better.

K Le Guin, her activism and radical thought are relevant. Critical thought and action to HE landscape now is what sci-fi is to classical novel writing.\n\nAbout the **diverse_precarious mailing list** : Initiated on 5 March, 2020 during Open Uni Day we celebrated in K\u00f6ln in the context of ongoing strikes/protests in the UK, France and Italy. 20 people of whom many are also activists in education unions, collaborating with solidarity academics for progress reforms in the Bologna system as well as the excellence clusters in Germany. Geographically based in Germany, but dealing with trans-sectional issues beyond borders.\n\n## Academic neoliberal agendas: \u2018if we win in France against a neo-liberal university, we can stain the oil well beyond national borders\u2019\n\nBy Cristina del Biaggio. \n*NB: Notes in 1st person follow Christina's words.*\n\nI am a geographer, working on migrations and borders. In this moment working on migrants deaths in the Alpine region and on networks of sanctuary cities. I started late my PhD and did not only work in academia. I have as well experience in NGOs and am quite active as well on migration justice issues as an activist pleading for freedom of movement. And I do not really separate my activist experience with my academic experience. I live at the borders between the two.\n\nI am Swiss and Italian and I am since 2017 living in France, in Grenoble.\n\nShe has been a supporter of Academics for Peace in Turkey since 2016, and organised two seminars (see links below). When in Switzerland, Cristina accumulated 24 contracts - from assistant to lecturer, 50-60%, always in an unstable precarious situation.\n\nIn France now she has a permanent position, she is basically a civil servant. From December 2019 to March 2020 strikes started in France against a law that was thought by the French government, she was feeling bad because the reason she was there was actually what made her go away from Switzerland - she was realising that France was going in the same direction.\n\nThe reality in Switzerland: few places for professors, who were ready to take on as many precarious as they could who were dependent on them. A minority of women were professors - 20% in Basel, Lausanne and in other places. Privileged situation for PhD students - good materials, equipment, research funding, great for those at the head, but generalised precarity at all the middle level. Nothing in between.\n\nKey issues:\n\n* There are **no intermediary permanent positions** as a young doctor you can only pretend having precarious contracts\n\n* Recurrent problems of **sexual harassment**\n\n* The institutions perpetuate the myth that **\u201cstars professors from abroad\u201d are much better than locals** (of course, this increases the Shangai index), exclusion of Swiss researchers (formed with Swiss money\u2026) from the permanent position\n\n* You are pushed to make **long experiences abroad** (with all the difficulties that this means when you are not 20 years old anymore)\n\nShe thought: she cannot go on, as she was working on topics that were not critical. She said to herself: either I quit academia to work in another sector or I find a position that\u2019s permanent. When she turned 40 she found it in France, at the Univ of Grenoble.\n\n### **'My actual experience in France as permanent academic in a endangered university'**\n\nFrance is seen abroad, but as well by the politicians in power, as having \u201c20 years delay compared to the other countries\u201d. This is why in the last years they tried (and partly managed) to reform the university system. Indeed, in France, universities resisted the \u201cneoliberal sirens singing\u201d, until recently. It is actually what brought me in France.\n\n* **Precarity:** introduction of \u201ctenure tracks\u201d, not anymore recruited on the base of \u201cannual national competition\u201d but on criteria decided by each university. This while France was still a country with a high number of personnel in intermediary by permanent position MCF = assistant professors).\nToday, in the institute where I teach, 50% of the teaching hours are given either via extra-hours or precarious.\nIt is calculated that France lacks about 10000 professors (or assistant professors) to cover the needs in teaching, now occupied by precarious personnel which is paid less than the minimum wage (less than 10 EUR/hour) and when they are lucky paid every semester!!\nIt has been calculated that if the trends continue as it did in the last 5-10 years, in 2030 there will be 0 MCF recruited.\n\n* **Less and less long-term resources and more financial resources through projects via the national science fund** (called ANR)\n\n* **Privatisation** (via project funds)\n\nYou have in Germany a lot of things trying to be put in place, or in France to close the gap, but it\u2019s the absence of those things which made it more valuable - we could have used them for post-neoliberal university but unfortunately things are going in the opposite direction.\n\n> *If I am fighting here and now it is because I firmly believe that if we win in France against a neo-liberal university, we can stain the oil well beyond national borders. And if, in France, we do not give in to the siren song of neoliberal universities, I am also firmly convinced that the supposed \"delay\" decried by some today will turn into an advance in the future. Because the discontent is also growing in other European countries, which are fighting for what we in France are losing, but fortunately we have not yet completely lost.* - Cristina ([source](http://www.riurba.review/2020/03/comprendre-le-neoliberalisme-universitaire-francais-a-partir-de-la-suisse/) - in French)\n\n### **We need safe spaces, we need to care for each other.**\n\nThe Government is trying to pass a new law as quickly as possible - we have to learn a lot about what happened in Turkey. What we are going to do now when universities in France will become as others in Europe. The new law provisions to remove autonomy of HE institutions as well as knowledge workers and cut back budgets on permanent positions, turning knowledge production into one of neoliberal order, precarious, temporary and mostly based on short-term project funding (this is the actual system in Germany and Switzerland in the last decade, so it seems like these two are acting as models to other states in Europe).\n\nWhich strategy for knowledge production, knowledge transmission, critical thought in this structural liberal scenario of precarity and privatization? What I learned from you is that there are probably strategies to put into place to at least continue in another way - to do what we are asked for: thinking and producing knowledge.\n\n## Systemic inequalities and lost knowledge in higher education: \u2018precarious researchers are seen increasingly instrumentally - sources to be mined, and then discarded at the end of a project\u2019\n\nBy Rebecca Collins.\n\nHas been at Chester for 6 years - it\u2019s a very different type of institution than where she had been before.\n\nThe idea of expectations of mobility touched on by Cristina: there\u2019s an expectation of mobility which drives fragmentation.\n\nPrecarity looks very differently in different types of institutions in different places. The nature of precarity at my institution is different - especially because of demographics and geographies i.e. age compared to other higher education institutions in the UK.\n\n1. **Economic circumstances** - country, but also family circumstances, where an individual comes from; relationship status: does someone have a partner? gender inequality: who is the careworker in the family? Who does the caring work at the workplace? Not just managerial styles; if you\u2019re an academic who teaches, who is doing the majority of pastoral work?\n\n2. **Race and ethnic identity bias** : relates to accessibility of opportunities, but also the forms of knowledge created within those groups and the extent they are seen as acceptable. In the UK it\u2019s gaining a bit of traction, but remains to be seen if it will create change.\n\n3. **National politics driving systemic inequality** -freedom of thought, freedom of speech, as well as party political values and priorities. How and why knowledge is being lost? At the university institutional level, each university has its own package of history and identity: who is seen as the right fit?\n\nAll of these intersecting demographic challenges need to be navigated, depending on who you are.\n\nAll of these inequalities contribute in different ways to \u2018lost knowledge\u2019, valorised knowledge production: whose experiences are heard and whose aren\u2019t. Often not explicitly so.\n\nEducational systems are across difft global north contexts driven by traditional neoliberal structures. If we\u2019re being told increasingly that we have to show how our research contributes to improving society. But if we frame our funding calls around that, we are not theoretical enough. All these contradictions are produced.\n\nRebecca is concerned about **early career researchers:** I skipped precarity, I don\u2019t have the lived embodied experience, but reflected on precarity experienced by others. Realised that precarious researchers are seen increasingly instrumentally - sources to be mined, and then discarded at the end of a project. We\u2019ve long seen this approach to research *participants* as deeply unethical, so how long until the same view is taken of precarious researchers?\n\nPascale: The liberalization of our academic market - for an outsider academic is a difficult political problem. On one end, we are very critical. But on the other, our precarity is also transmitted forward for incoming researchers.\n\nAsli: \u2018Fake internalization\u2019, \u2018forced displacement\u2019 like in Turkey, Syria, Latin America. It is indeed a dilemma because we can actually politically endanger academics.\n\n## Decolonial movements and alternative unionization efforts\n\nBy Ayse Batur.\n\nAyse studied in Turkey and then went to Canada to do a PhD. Wasn\u2019t able to finish because of the 2008 crisis. Came back to Turkey to do freelancing translation and editing. Now in Germany.\n\nAs scholars or international workers, we have failed to protect our field. A lot of people from Turkey had to find new professions. This failure pushes you to make a realistic analysis of the working situations.\n\nEven though France, UK, Switzerland are facing new neoliberal policies and reductions to the programs, they still have a lot of funding, especially Germany, whereas in places in Turkey, Italy, Greece, they depend on public funding for a lot of the research positions. Something that amazes the rest of us - is that there is a lot of money, so it\u2019s about how it\u2019s distributed. For example, research institutes produce research, and seminars, but they don\u2019t become part of the academic structures.\n\nScholars have the opportunity to challenge the high castle - through i.e. feminism, or feminist studies. Women\u2019s movements have pressured unis in the US to introduce gender equality, decolonialism/ postcolonialism and other categories relevant for diminishing inequality, that have affected disciplines internally.\n\nWe are in a vulnerable situation, but we also have a critical perspective from the inside.\n\nWhat is the bird-eye view in order to connect the dots?\n\nOur struggle here, in trying to produce the critical work in our field, is also connected to what is happening in our cities. I think we should try to reconnect to that.\n\nSuggestions:\n\n* try to see the connection between our practice and the movements\n\n* organise around labour and around our work from i.e. precarious conditions, like Cristina working as an itinerant scholar. Many Turkish colleagues who came to Germany without really understanding their contractual position. Universities have a lot of regulations putting limits to intermediary scholars i.e. how long they can work in the same institution. This is yet another level of precariousness. We need to start talking about real life conditions.\n\n## Discussion\n\nCristina: Reacting to Ayse\u2019s words \u00ab we have failed to protect the university \u00bb \u2014> Actually we finished the seminar with scholars from Brazil and Turkey by saying: \u00ab We cannot probably safe the world, but we have now to care for ourselves and found safe spaces where we can continue to produce and transmit knowledge \u00bb. This is what a researcher from Brazil said to a researcher from Turkey while giving her a necklace handcrafted by a group of indigenous people in Amazonia.\n\nMaria: I\u2019m a first generation academic in Sweden, from a rural area. None of our parents went to university. A lot of us struggle a lot to do this next step - getting into real academic circles. A lot of us default to other kinds of work. I think the reason is the lack of guidance and our perception of academia. Those already in it know how to play the game, but for the rest of us it\u2019s hard.\n\nNur: Academia is a pyramid scheme\u2014in response to Maria\u2014it is meant to fail the majority. let me qualify my comment: Neoliberal academic system functions like a pyramid system\n\nCristina: trying to find a way that you are not lost in this inegalitarian, racist, hierarchical system that is the university. On the other side, you have to know what you want. What is happening now in France is that a lot of young people say - I\u2019m going to go through it because I think in the end I\u2019m going to make it.\n\nAyse: we need to create sites of resistance, more stable structures in order to continue the struggle; labour unions are just one of them. Example: [www.biraradaakademi.org](http://www.biraradaakademi.org) in Turkey\n\nNoemi: What about networks that are not only with academics, where civil society also joins because you need different kinds of interventions or lobbying. Examples were given (see refs below)\n\nFrom Rebecca: Love Ayse's point about not understanding social norms of the seminar room. Such a big barrier for those for whom university (whether undergrad, postgrad, research...) is a huge unknown. I remember being so scared as an undergrad that I didn't know how to interact in supervisions (very small group teaching). Took me most of my first year to get to grips with it. There's a bigger point here about class cultural norms and how they shape accessibility of education.\n\nCristina: This is not something to support, but we built a network of women and feminist geographers in France and it is really useful to exchange information, practices, references, etc. This is quite useful not to feel alone and to build resistance\n\nNur: Lost her job in Turkey for political reasons. Wasn\u2019t active for family reasons, and she was busy. She\u2019s here through Ayse. It\u2019s important that we do see ourselves as academic labourers, rather than academics. It allows us to position ourselves differently, and to organise. I don\u2019t have a lot of hope for Academia right now, but the only hope is through really serious organisation.\n\nTo stop accepting that exploitative labour also means to stop buying into this story about \"if you go through this and are good enough you will get there\".\n\nDavid: Currently in Turin, Italy, an independent researcher and freelancer. New to the continent, has a decade of experience in the US. Was involved in a labour movement in the US - labour has historically been progressive, it\u2019s arguable how they helped marginalised groups, but they played some role in this dynamic. In the US, we rely increasingly on adjunct faculty contracts - semester to semester. This is happening when tuition costs are rising for students. It\u2019s not sustainable for much longer.\n\nIn the Illinois Institute of Art in Chicago, we had a labour fight where the professors were also interested in working with the adjuncts for a deal. They were not unionised at the time - so they had a good incentive. We had a union vote, we lost the union vote, but what broke us was a series of mandatory meetings violating the laws. They were supposed to be neutral educators attending - they suggested strongly that if the full time faculty did not organise, they had to look for what they were most prioritising. The adjuncts could dilute the bargaining power. If the full time professors did strike for better terms, the university could pick up some classes that they wanted. **It was in the uni\u2019s best interest to negotiate with us separately and dilute the union vote.**\n\nKatja: PhD student in Bonn. Non-transparent practices of the steering committee, you can\u2019t know how it works, who has what rights. She challenged the voting process of PhD students leadership and was completely silenced.\n\nRebecca: Is the centre linked to an academic department or faculty? Or is it completely independent?\n\nKatja: ...it's independent, financed by the DFG (German Research Foundation)\n\nRebecca - I can see how that makes accountability for poor practice much harder to challenge. I can't think of an easy solution.., I hope you have some support and solidarity from peer networks, if not from your fellow PhD students.\n\nKatja: in Germany, a lot of graduate centers are clusters, or satellites that are not part of the university structure, funded for a fixed term.

Some considerations:\n\n* Very exciting, even radical, specific challenge. This seems to be something like \"OK, if we leave this to the engineers alone we are going to fail very badly, as *all* material resources-based economic and social models have done since Limits to Growth. We need to call the social scientists and humanities scholars in\". Great!\n* Something of a disconnect between this specific challenge and the scope section. Which is all about analyzing sectors, seeing where they are, and sketching possible transition scenarios. \n* Strongly bolted on top on the (concluded) [EU Circular Economy Action Plan](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/circular-economy/index_en.htm) and the [EU Strategy for Plastics](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/33251cf9-3b0b-11e9-8d04-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF/source-87705298). Orgs that have run projects \"in the same topic\" are \"strongly encouraged\" to apply. \n\nMy conclusion: it does not make sense to just present a proposal. We should, instead, find consortia in the making that have the prerequisites, and offer our services to them. Based on this conclusion, I wrote [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IN2C8Ev4M2vofurjBkkK7mMhmZTIIGL7XmiI7i0V30c/edit#).

One thing from @mirkopresser stayed with me: something like \n\n> the Commission feels a mismatch between who they are talking and the pioneers of this new human-centric Internet.\n\nAs I considered this, I realized that it is not at all clear (not to me, at least) what \"a human-centric Internet\" actually is. @RobvanKranenburg (at the London meeting) and @katjab (in [this article](https://www.britishcouncil.org/anyone-anywhere/explore/web-for-all/rethinking-internet)) have spelled out the NGI Forward vision as well as I know how: \n\n> But things don\u2019t have to be this way. Between Silicon Valley\u2019s corporate-led internet and the Chinese model, where the government is in charge, can we come up with a third narrative, where citizens and communities are in control and can determine their own future?\n\nIn other words, **for now all we have a is a big question mark**. This opens a lot of room for \"mismatches\" like the one described by Mirko. Who is it the Commission have in mind? Who could be a good metaphor for a human-centric Internet builder? A Creative Commons lawyer? A Siemens R&D employee? A startupper drawing exponential curves in a PowerPoint file?\n\nAs I mused about these things I chanced into a discussion on [Scuttlebutt](https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/),  (like @hugi and @matthias, I try to keep some tendrils in the indieweb, probably not as seriously as they do). To see the whole thing, if you use Scuttlebutt, use message ID `%u0fnmwUQTBcL9S8HP3uYCdBgnssu4GIyWSuo5XLYvPs=.sha256`, but the title says it all: \"Deprioritizing first world problems\". The back story is this: an often-repeated feature request of Scuttlebutt is to provide for a multi-device account. The author of the original post has this to offer:\n\n> Multi-device management is by definition a problem experienced by people who  *own multiple devices* , and those are probably by definition not the underconnected world [...]. \n\n>It turns out that if you pick first world techies as your target audience, you'll be dealing with people who perceive tiny inconveniences to be major showstoppers. Moreover, if you keep on catering to them, you'll be empowering privileged people more than the underprivileged (one example is that if you build apps to be online-only, you are privileging the privileged with good internet connectivity and ignoring the underprivileged, widening the inequality gap further). Meanwhile, underprivileged people are less demanding and more welcoming to almost any progress. In other words, it takes 100h of work to make a privileged audience satisfied, while it takes 10h to make an underprivileged audience satisfied, because of low-hanging fruits and less demanding attitude from users. And the underprivileged are often excluded from target audiences because they aren't economically viable customers. But that's when you're running a business, and with Manyverse I'm not. It takes a tech giant or a VC-funded startup to build polished apps for first world techies, while it takes just a reasonable amount of free time from open sourcerers to build decent proof-of-concept software for less demanding audiences.\n\nThis gave me a bit of an \"aha\" moment. The builders of Scuttlebutt **started from the sort of human community they wanted to build**: open to the underprivileged, solving basic social connectivity problems while staying away from surveillance capitalism, etc., *and on those basis they are making all their technical choices*, right down to the editor. As they do that, they discover and exploit sources of economic efficiency (\"underprivileged audiences are less demanding, easier to serve with open source tech\"). They ended up with a very different product from the ones they are seeking to replace, and with a *very* different community. Diaspora still feels Facebook-ish: Scuttlebutt feels completely different, to me at least. See the video below if you want a quick intro.\n\nSo. Human-centric, check. Technical innovation, check. Social innovation, check. Are communities like these those we are supposed to engage in NGI Forward? If so, I am afraid the narrative will have to change in depth to make space for that much diversity in the conversation.. Those guys might engage, but they will come asking some deep, probably unsettling questions. \"If the purpose is serving humans, it is not a given that we should be even giving business a say. By your own definition, business is only relevant if it serves humans\", and so on.\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/236358264", "created_at": "2019-03-06 09:10:06.148098", "updated_at": "2019-05-10 20:04:14.399456", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 753, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 578.8, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 5, 4022, 2915, 5083], "is_private": false}, {"id": 66889, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 11974, "post_number": 22, "raw": "Partners can join from [associated countries](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/grants_manual/hi/3cpart/h2020-hi-list-ac_en.pdf) outside the EU.\n\nBut: no proposal is likely to be successful if not led by one of the heavy hitters in the NGI space. @BlackForestBoi is aware of this.", "created_at": "2019-12-04 15:56:20.633975", "updated_at": "2019-12-04 15:56:20.633975", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 52, "wiki": false, "reads": 26, "score": 65.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 4, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [66883], "is_liked_by": [4892, 5191], "is_private": false}, {"id": 66849, "user_id": 5528, "topic_id": 11974, "post_number": 19, "raw": "[quote=\"MariaEuler, post:12, topic:11974\"]\nset up a room\n[/quote]\n\n@soenke @BlackForestBoi are we meeting on Friday?

Maybe Thessaly does not want to be like Bavaria after all. Maybe it wants to be like Bhutan, promote harmony and \u201cgross national happiness\u201d. Maybe Pomerania wants to try a high-efficiency, low-GDP economy based on public goods. Maybe Sicily wants to try being a solarpunk utopia of mostly self-sustaining communities. As these regions move up the learning curve, their learning benefits us all \u2013 we can copy from them, the former laggards, what they have found to work. \u2013 **Alberto Cottica, Edgeryders**, opening remarks ([read the full post](http://www.cottica.net/2020/10/09/regional-policies-in-the-eu-from-convergence-to-exploration/)). \n\n\n> People tend to feel it is always the same clique of NGOs and experts. However, there are \u201cislands of good practice\u201d, and they are many: OECD has recently listed 300 of them, from all over the world, in the last 10 years. Good practice tend to be associated with deliberation (people decide, not just advise), with professionalization of engagement, both on the side of public officials, and on that of citizens. \u2013  **Alessandro Bellantoni, OECD**\n\n> In my experience, engagement is situated. It happens at the point of delivery, where people\u2019s life takes place. People are already participating in politics by living their lives; thus, citizens do not need to become active, because they already are.\n> Oh, and participation is not always about talking: anthropologists know that people do not always say what they do or do what they say \u2013  **@amelia Hassoun, the Oxfort Internet Institute**\n\n> In Messina, we follow Amartya Sen\u2019s capability approach: development is essentially freedom.

The process begins when an idea or solution is posted on the online event forum, sparking discussion among community members. Some join in, actively listening, asking questions or giving thoughtful responses. (This is a safe place and not for debating opinions or speaking for others.)\n\nThe discussion begins with first hand accounts of attempts taken to solve the issues at hand and moves to navigating the personal challenges experienced by participants. Nuances and the various different contexts surrounding these challenges begins to show.\n\n### Information analysis & Action\n\nNext open source technology is used to make connections between topics being discussed, the people discussing them, places, projects, solutions and struggles. When we put this together, patterns start to emerge that help join these ideas and people to each other and to other information, skill and resources.\n\nBy the end of the process, participants have gained a richer knowledge and understanding of the issue they wish to tackle and have a blueprint to put their idea into action.\n<br>\n\n## Format of the live online event\n\n* **A Zoom meeting.** We will send you the link after you create your\n\n* **Not a panel, an open, moderated discussion.** A moderator will give the floor to people who want to contribute something.

Embedding Dynalist in Matrix](#chap-9-2)\n\n------\n\n## 1. Functional design customizations <a name=\"chap-1\"></a>\n\n**Status:** finished\n\n@anu created a Stylus user agent stylesheet that provides various functional design improvements, including color-coded tags for task status, highlighting tags using the own username, better header formatting etc..\n\nFor details, see our [Dynalist Manual](/t/id/7618) in section \"7. Adapting the Dynalist appearance\".\n\n\n## 2. Notifications for changes in Dynalist <a name=\"chap-2\"></a>\n\n**Status:** in progress\n\nThere would be the following types of notifications, each containing a direct link to the concerned task in Dynalist:\n\n* **Task assignment.** \"You have been assigned a new task by {username} on Dynalist: {name and link}.\"\n\n* **Task reassignment.** \"Your task {name and link} has been transferred to {username}.\"\n\n* **Deadline added / changed.** \"Your task {name and link} has been given a [new] deadline: {date}.\" \n\n* **Upcoming deadline.** \"The deadline {date} for your task {name and link} is coming up in {days}.\" Derived from the `!(yyyy-mm-dd)` Dynalist dates, and (optionally) a custom tag that tells the system when to start reminding the user of the upcoming deadline. Such as `#notify-1w` for \"start one week before\".\n\n* **@mention.** \"You have been mentioned by {username} on in Dynalist task {name and link}.\"\n\n* **Notifying extra people.** By applying a custom `#notify-{username}` tag to a task, a project manager etc. can subscribe to notifications about a task as well, such as for an upcoming deadline. But probably easier by adding a second assignee.\n\nDynalist now [provides an API](https://apidocs.dynalist.io) and due to this, creating notifications about changes in Dynalist will be quite simple.\n\n\n### 2.1. E-mail notifications <a name=\"chap-2-1\"></a>\n\nThe most basic and most important type of notifications. Best created by a stand-alone software running on a server.\n\n\n### 2.2. Browser push notifications <a name=\"chap-2-2\"></a>\n\nPush notifications are asynchronous messages sent by a server to a browser. The web application in the browser can then decide how to react. For example, it can show desktop notifications \u2013 the small popup windows that pop up on top of the screen, outside of the browser window. (They can be enabled in Discourse, for example.)\n\nTechnically, push notifications that result in these desktop notifications consist of three parts:\n\n1. **[HTTP Web Push Protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8030).** A simple protocol by which a server-side application can send push messages to a client-side web application in a browser. This is standardized as RFC 8030. There are various open source implementations of this protocol that help a server-side software manage and send push notifications; most are contained in the [web-push-libs](https://github.com/web-push-libs) repos, among them [a Python library](https://github.com/web-push-libs/pywebpush). When dealing with Python, there is [a great tutorial](https://code.luasoftware.com/tutorials/pwa/develop-web-push-notification-server-with-python/) showing how to create a complete push notifications server, and [another tutorial here](https://mushfiq.me/2017/09/25/web-push-notification-using-python/).\n\n    There is also [a Ruby gem](https://github.com/zaru/webpush), used for example [within Discourse](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/2eb2f273a86109706271e3b7c98a9d2cdd9669f7/app/services/push_notification_pusher.rb). \n\n2. **[Push API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API).** A standardized JavaScript interface of the browser that allows a web application to interact with the HTTP Web Push Protocol mentioned above. For example, subscribing to and unsubscribing from various types of push notifications.\n\n3. **[Notifications API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/notification).** A standardized JavaScript interface of the browser that allows to configure and show desktop notifications.\n\nThere are various SaaS services that provide a service to distribute push notifications: [Pushy](https://pushy.me/), [OneSignal](https://onesignal.com/), [Pushover](https://pushover.net/clients/desktop), [Pushpad](https://pushpad.xyz/), [etc.](https://dzone.com/articles/20-free-amp-secure-alternatives-to-the-parse-push). Often, they include additional features like also delivering notifications by SMS etc.. But as we only want \"simple\" browser based push notifications, these services only create additional costs, dependencies and installation complexity, none of which is good for the small open source application we want to create.\n\n\n### 2.3. App-based mobile notifications <a name=\"chap-2-3\"></a>\n\nIn addition to or instead of the browser-based push notifications described above, a mobile app for the sole task of creating notifications for the above Dynalist events will be very helpful. While it is true that browser-based push notifications can be received on mobile devices even if no tab is open, this is confusing behavior and should be rather avoided (for example, it is not immediately clear how to disable these notifications again). Also, Safari based browsers do not support push notifications at all [TODO: source]. A notifications app seems to be a cleaner solution.\n\nThe app would be fully open source and operate by downloading and analyzing the Dynalist content belonging to an account, creating events as content updates come in. Surely more \n\n\n### 2.4. Discourse notifications <a name=\"chap-2-4\"></a>\n\nWhat we really need to avoid the \"too many tools\" scenario are Discourse reminders and notifications about Dynalist tasks. Because then there's only one notification system, and also Dynalist will get a notifications feature (which it does not have so far because the integration of Dynalist Pro with Google Calendar supposedly [provides notifications about deadlines](https://trello.com/c/Vk5eUd89).\n\nIn Discourse, a bot would post comments about Dynalist events to a dedicated topic per project, probably pinned and put into the project's workspace. It would be named \"{projectname} Tasks\", which results in Discourse notifications being shown usefully as \"@mention / reply [for] {projectname} Tasks\". All comments posted by the bot would be deducted from parsing automated OMPL backups of the Dynalist document.\n\n\n### 2.5. Matrix notifications <a name=\"chap-2-5\"></a>\n\nSimilar to the Discourse notifications described above, it is possible to post equivalent notifications to Matrix chatrooms. It could suit better, as it does not clutter Discourse topics with small chunks of information, and because we use Matrix more for collaboration than Discourse. Also this is quite simple to do, as there the existing implementation of a Matrix bot for Slack integration can be used as a basis. However, a mobile notification app for Dynalist will be much more useful to people outside Edgeryders as well, so rather plan to develop that.\n\n\n## 3. Backups <a name=\"chap-3\"></a>\n\n**Status:** in progress, initial implementation finished\n\nQuite important, as there is no revision history but many collaborators in the task list who could accidentally delete content. So far, Anu is [task](https://dynalist.io/d/7aI9WsBWMMgCS2aablD9uIjT#z=-8WW_BwN9JLAyfK36l51nm5q)ed to create a backup every 2-3 days, and we might automate that with a script. But the easiest permanent solution is to have one [Dynalist Pro account](https://dynalist.io/pricing) for the company (8 USD/month), as that includes daily backups to Google Drive \u2013 and because Dynalist is just great for us, supporting its development with a paid subscription is in our own interest.\n\nFor the (yet to be finished) documentation of our Dynalist backup system, see our [Dynalist Manual](/t/id/7618) in section \"8. Keeping backups\".\n\n\n## 4. Gantt charts <a name=\"chap-4\"></a>\n\n**Status:** idea\n\nFor that, we would introduce custom syntax to express dependencies between tasks, such as `#depends {dynalist-task-url}` which renders nicely into linked tasks in Dynalist. If necessary, also custom syntax for the typical constraints \"earliest start date\", \"latest start date\", earliest end date\" \u2013 the \"latest end date\" syntax exists: `!(yyyy-mm-dd)`.\n\nThen, a script can generate Gantt charts from OPML exports of Dynalist documents, and keep a linked Discourse topic up to date with them.\n\n\n## 5. Task archiving <a name=\"chap-5\"></a>\n\n**Status:** idea\n\nIf desired, asks could be archived on Discourse. For that, a script would remove them from the \"Done\" sections (after a number of days being there) and add them automatically to a certain Discourse topic. Probably, to the first post of the Discourse topic used to manage Dynalist notifications for a project (see above).\n\n\n## 6. Syncing Github issues to Dynalist <a name=\"chap-6\"></a>\n\n**Status:** idea\n\nTo have only one place to look at for tasks, it would be great to sync Github issues of selected software projects to Dynalist tasks in corresponding sections, incl. syncing of issue assignment on Github to task assignment on Dynalist (but not the other way round, Github would still be the authoritative version, and Dynalist the reminder). A special tag or markup to indicate the corresponding Github issue could be used, making the task of the syncing script simpler.\n\n\n## 7. Offline usage <a name=\"chap-7\"></a>\n\n**Status:** idea\n\nTo be able to use any offline outliner software, including FreeMind, for offline editing of Dynalist documents. For that, the Dynalist document would be exported to OPML (already possible), converted to a native format (such as for FreeMind), edited offline, converted back to OPML, and then reconciled to the online OPML version based on a diff.\n\n\n## 8. Replacing Dynalist with open source software <a name=\"chap-8\"></a>\n\n**Status:** idea, with roadmap\n\nNot an easy task, but possible. See [my blog post](https://ma.juii.net/blog/software-for-collaboration) at \"Open Source Dynalist / Workflowy replacements\" for existing open source software that can be used to start from.\n\n\n## 9. Embedding Dynalist <a name=\"chap-9\"></a>\n\n**Status.** idea (probably a bad one; we do not intend to implement it)\n\n\n### 9.1. Embedding Dynalist in Discourse <a name=\"chap-9-1\"></a>\n\nNot sure this is recommendable, but it seems Dynalist can be embedded in an iframe (\"If you want to embed Dynalist in an iframe, now the header is hidden for better presentation.\" \u2013 [see](http://blog.dynalist.io/2016-week-26-update/)). So adding a new Onebox URL scheme for embedding into Discourse is all that's needed here. People might start to post links to individual Dynalist tasks (in the \"zoomed in\" mode), allowing to track the progress of these tasks right in Discourse by looking at the embeddings. Also, by embedding different Dynalist search results and tasks, embeddings can focus on tasks of a project, of a user etc..\n  &nbsp;&nbsp; It is not yet clear if and how we would manage access rights to the dynalist when embedding it into Discourse. Dynalist lists can be made anonymously editable, but that seems not advisable as trolls could delete all the content (and there is no edit history). So probably, sharing the dynalist to e-mail addresses for edit access is better. Still, there could be a view-only mode for which the link would be enough.\n\n\n### 9.2. Embedding Dynalist in Matrix <a name=\"chap-9-2\"></a>\n\nAgain as a possibly better alternative than embedding Dynalist in Discourse, we could embed it into Matrix. For that, Riot (our Matrix client application) provides the [widgets feature](https://matrix.org/blog/2017/08/23/introducing-matrix-widgets/), allowing to embed a Dynalist area right into the chat window. That could make it feel like a complete project management / collaboration cockpit.", "created_at": "2017-11-05 23:57:23.287048", "updated_at": "2019-03-08 15:54:40.983469", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2029, "wiki": true, "reads": 13, "score": 3322.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3791], "is_private": false}, {"id": 41510, "user_id": 3811, "topic_id": 7961, "post_number": 15, "raw": "5 days to go, and I'm in.\nCan't wait. :slight_smile:", "created_at": "2018-01-30 00:29:06.157509", "updated_at": "2018-01-30 00:29:06.157509", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 12, "wiki": false, "reads": 24, "score": 114.8, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4088, 5, 1935], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14797, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3752, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>What curation means</b>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Curators are pairs, 2 per track.

Additionally, curators can tell us (me) if they feel something is missing, and we will look from expertise in the community to make the missing session happen.

It is, in most parts, uncharted territory!\".  Similar claims  sound to me as a challenge to make the system confronting with what is happening at the ...Edge! However, your point is correct. Time and energy are limited and is not a good idea to waste them. So, I will make contact witht the REA to explore possibile obstacles before proceeding.\nAbout \"plan B\", of course have some alternatives in mind but it really depends on what's will come up in terms of calls for both individual or collective research.

The current generation is the first, that never will have experienced a world without internet.\n\nAs coming generations enter the educational system, they are now introduced to tools, thoughts and concepts derived from the digital world. Today, most of them are proprietary - opposite to free and open source.\n\nWhat happens to knowledge in our future digital world if proprietary world views on computers, internet and programming are left unchallenged?\n\nFree and open source values, such as transparency, collaboration, freedom and empowerment - are already cornerstones in our educational systems. So why don't we apply them when it comes to teaching computers?\n\nThe hypothesis is that teachers simply don't know enough of how free and open source really is central to knowledge itself. I believe we need to educate teachers and leaders in schools/academia in this area. That is how we change the game for the benefit of future generations of internet citizens.\n\nThis workshop aims to help to bring together actors in the educational systems with those from the core free and open source landscape. YOU are invited! Together we'll try to find ways to influence the educational system towards open source values. We stage the workshop to learn from joint experiences and develop concrete ways to reach the education system.\n\n### What will you experience?\n\nLearn about the cornerstones of Free &amp; Open Source and how those are fundamental to learning anything in a digital world.\n\nCollaborate on how to reach out to teachers with this message as one important group to win.\n\nHave a great time shaping the next generation internet citizens.\n\n<hr>\n\n# Frequently asked questions\n\n### How do I get an invitation/ticket to this workshop?\n\nUse this form which will take you through the registration process: https://register.edgeryders.eu/\n\n### How is this event being organised?\n\nThis event, and the festival it is part of, is coordinated on the edgeryders platform (where you are now) and co-curated through a series of community video calls. We have allocated a collaboratively managed budget for the festival and operate on a solidarity basis. Participants who need some financial support to organise or be able to participate in the festival are eligible provided they contribute towards making it a meaningful and generative experience for all - in the run up to, during and/or after the event. If you would like to join us but are unsure as to how to contribute, don\u2019t worry. Create an [edgeryders account](https://communities.edgeryders.eu/login), then [tell us a bit about yourself here](https://edgeryders.eu/c/ioh/tell-us-about-you) and we will guide you along from there.\n\n### How is this all financed?\n\nThis event is part of the NGI Forward project Generation Internet (NGI) initiative, launched by the European Commission in the autumn of 2016. It has received funding from the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 825652 from 2019-2021. You can learn more about the initiative and our involvement in it at [https://ngi.edgeryders.eu](https://ngi.edgeryders.eu/)\n\n![Ngi logo|150x61](https://ngi.edgeryders.eu/assets/images/ngi-logo.png)\n\n![Eu emblem|150x100](https://ngi.edgeryders.eu/assets/images/eu-emblem.png)\n\n### Does getting involved mean I endorse the funders views or actions?\n\nNo. What you are doing is contributing to an open consultation on the topic of how to build a next generation of internet infrastructure, technologies, business models etc that promotes the wellbeing of humans and the natural environment. The consultation methodology is designed in such a way as to allow for diversity of views, premises, disciplines, themes and contexts. We employ open notebook science principles and the results will be presented in the form of a research report accessible to everyone after the event. You can follow the process, review the methodology and open source tech we are using and engage directly with the research and coordination team here: https://edgeryders.eu/c/ioh/workspace\n\n### What is the code of conduct?\n\nIt is important to us that everyone in the room feels welcomed and safe; if you have any particular concerns or needs just send me a PM here on the platform or write to [nadia@edgeryders.eu](mailto:nadia@edgeryders.eu) .\n\nThe Edgeryders online platform technology and activities are intended for people to cooperate within and across projects trying to build a better world.

Couldn't leave without saying how much your stories moved me. Its so interesting to read about a corrupt and failing system. Im sorry to hear that your people, family and friends have to suffer through it and live with the ever lingering anxiety of how to provide healthcare for the elderly and ageing population. It's amazing to realise how different the structure is here in the UK where healthcare and social support is free for all. I have often been critical about the impact of free healthcare on the complacency of families to neglect and dismiss their elders to the care of the state, often with huge and high expectations of what the state can and should provide. I think it has contributed to a fractured family structure in society with sometimes little care and responsibility of families to look after their loved ones. There is an enormous financial burden that is placed on the NHS with the ageing population, to have them pick up the bill for every person in a care home is unsustainable and to some degree unfair on the system itself. \n\nReading this however, I can appreciate a little more the enormous pressures that is put on family and friends when this support does not exist. It is inspiring to hear of people such as Vlad Voiculescu who come into support others in an otherwise neglected area. There is amazing potential for the redistribution of wealth (and wealth in health care provisions). The money is out there and the provisions most definitely are as well, they are just not spread evenly!! \n\nAs always we may hope on a middle ground, with services available for the elderly, looking after their specific health care needs. But I would hope that family involvement would always be encouraged and part of a sustainable system.

There are several reasons for this. Amongst others that the new platform is in development and several community members, myself included, have working on getting it ready by February on volunteer basis. The other one is that several of us have been racing behind the scenes to build new partnerships with organisations other than the Council of Europe. One reason is to raise some money to cover the costs of organising the next lote event and some small capital to put into a crowdfunding campaign. The other is that we started Edgeryders not to just have conversations and collaborations amongst ourselves, but to facilitate members collaborations with all kinds of organisations and institutions all over Europe. And to build legitimacy for ourselves as a collective. The third reason being that we can see that Edgeryders is moving more towards action and it would be cool if it could better support concrete collaborations between members on projects coming out of the collectivity. This requires a lot of coordination, is extremely time consuming and quite unglamorous work.

That's because it appears to be a strongly art-related project, including enjoyable live performance / event, and playful interactions. I'm completely unexperienced in all this, being myself rather hardcore tech-centered. Yet I acknowledge and respect the power of art to produce a strong bond to people, more than tech can (even if it works ...).\n\nTwo pointers, however.\n\nFirst, the resources on the platform seem to derive their value to a good part from social interactions (live event, social platform). This can work, but definitely needs a critical mass of people. (Two of my own attempts of setting up an online community failed because they missed just that critical mass. Edgeryders has the critical mass, but maybe only while it's still \"new and cool\".)\u00a0 The other approach is the \"aggregative\", knowledge-centric way of building an online community (includes the two projects I mentioned in the first post); this can work with less people at the start.

I haven't dealt with any of the usual sources of social venture funding but I do recall two encounters with the Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems. In the one situation I was involved in a startup that a friend wanted help securing funding for. To be honest I was sceptical about the project and told the person that the numbers simply didn't add up, that the market for their project simply didn't exist in Sweden as the population is simply too small and they were up against much bigger and heavily bankrolled internationally successful project. There wasn't even a prototype to show. In the second case I was involved in setting up a project which had\u00a0 alot of potential and had already been prototyped successfully- so there was something we wanted to continue building on as opposed to in the first case.\n\nGuess which one was supported? While the second did very well and continues to be built on, the former was a total failure other than to launch the founder's career as a speaker and webguru. And that started to get me thinking, and asking questions :)\n\nA friend of mine is currently exploring the changing face of philanthropy, how the ways in which we are supporting good work is changing.

Overall, all the project leaders have made a very good progress. Here are the details:\n\n**Meeting 1:** @mohamed75 Colex (Egypt)\n\nOverall Mohamed has made a very good progress since the beginning of OCI Lab program.\n\nHere is a description of the progress made so far:\n\n* The customer discovery has been correctly done and the problem and solution have been validated with the customer segment, i.e. Poultry farmers who need the product to save money given the high cost of electricity and the burden related to gaz bottles.\n* Colax has created an MVP of a new product that will be used by residents. The prototype has been tested and adjusted.\n* Colax has received an order of 50 units and they need money to rent a workshop and to buy some raw material to start making the quantity ordered.\n* Patents request have been submitted.\n* Marketing remains a weak spot. The good thing is that Mohamed is aware of the issue and they started working of the brand, logo and products\u2019 packaging. More efforts should be dedicated to preparing a marketing strategy.\n\n\n**Meeting 2:** @saif.eddine.laalej Zelij Invent\n\nCustomer discovery has been conducted which allows to validate the problem and the solution and to narrow the target market by getting rid of the government and focusing on architects and real estate companies.\n\nA manual prototype was created as well as the molds however, the machine is not yet created due to funding problems, which prevented the team from being able to create the first machine made prototype and to test it.\n\nIn this respect, Zelij received an order to equip a new parking.\n\nOverall Saifeedine and his team made a good progress both in the technical and business sides. Next steps will be to get an international certification to be able to sell the product and abroad.\n\nWe discussed the next actions that will be undertaken and we agreed that Saifeddine will update the action plan taking into account the progress made so far.\n\n\n**Meeting 3:** @HadeerGhareeb  Didi Asks\n\nHaddeer and her team made a good progress and almost all the actions in the action plan have been done according to the indicated deadlines.\n\nThe customer discovery is done during a big event on female entrepreneurship attended by more than 6000 people. The target customer segments, i.e. young active adults, is validated and their problem and solution as well. They have identified another customer segment, i.e. university students.  However, a different product should be created with different questions and a lower price.\n\n100 copies of the game have been printed and the packaging improved.\n\nWe discussed the marketing strategy. According to Haddeer, offline marketing is the best way to reach the target customers however due to Corona Virus threat; all the actions planned are postponed. We discussed how she can take advantage from the situation and use the social media to promote her product including using other social media such as Instagram to reach the target audience.  \n\n \n\n**Meeting 4:** @Hsan Haddar Lexi Aka Spellit\n\nThe prototype has been created and it\u2019s currently being tested in a dyslexia center. The risk related to corona virus spread prevented Hssan and his team from attending the test, however they will get a feedback as well as video recording that would help them refining the prototype.\n\nAlso, the good thing is that they have received a preorder of 40 units. The revenue model is also very interesting. In addition to the main game, customers can buy new add-on modules.  \n\nCurrently funding is a real issue. The team needs the money to pay the prototype development fees and to proceed with the go to market strategy. In this respect, I advised Hssan to work on the product branding, community management of the FB Page and how to articulate the different actions of the marketing strategy.", "created_at": "2020-03-15 18:47:09.894936", "updated_at": "2020-07-20 13:51:23.935232", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 664, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 103.4, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3782, 5884, 4934, 6078], "is_private": false}, {"id": 54626, "user_id": 5154, "topic_id": 10089, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hello everyone,\n\nIt just came to me that I posted my [first text here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/the-new-moral-code-of-21st-century/10030/4) without properly introducing myself beforehand, so let's remedy that :blush:\n\nThe name which is visible in my passport is actually Vladica, but I joined the community under this handle because I use it across different networks and it's been my nickname for 15 years. \n\nI am a 29 year old (almost turning 30) social entrepreneur, based in Belgrade, Serbia. I studied journalism and communications, and have been a grassroots activist since I was 20, mostly in corruption in health and electoral reform campaigns. During my university years I was active in debating and co-organized European University Debating Championship in 2012. Even though I love debating, I love storytelling more - mostly because I have witnessed so many times the impact of a good story combined with facts, which usually is lacking if you are just trying to make fact-based point.\n\nThings I care about are civil society and how it can impact change, making civil society and (social) entrepreneurs more sustainable, more impactful and more visible, and I am active in different women and gender initiatives and climate and zero waste actions. And also, I am queer, so often find myself explaining a lot of stuff about what that means and how it's different than other LGBTQ identities and orientations.\nI have a habit of buying flowers both for myself and for my friends, I read and watch a lot of fiction (sometimes when washing the dishes and cooking) and my favourite activity is coaching - be it students, civil or business executives or organizations as collective entities. \n\nMy interest in wellbeing comes from trying to find one framework to help me understand better my life and those of my friends and family and I am looking forward to many discussions here. :slight_smile:\n\nIf you want to see more of a CV-like info on me, check out my Linkedin:  https://www.linkedin.com/in/vladicawlaychejovanovic/\n\nAnd if you wanna ask me anything - just shoot :slight_smile:", "created_at": "2019-06-06 07:55:54.160872", "updated_at": "2019-09-27 08:50:40.040788", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 356, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 193.4, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856, 3, 5174, 137, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 71405, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 12844, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Dear teachers and students,\n\nWe ask you to share your experiences, challenges and solutions while schools are closed to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d.\n\n* How well do you feel prepared for this sudden step forward in digital teaching and learning? \n* Do you have good resources you would recommend? \n* Or are you searching for solutions? \n\n**Our community will surely be happy to help out with ideas and suggestions.**\n\n* Did you have some especially good or bad experiences? \n* How does your \u201cnew normal\u201d day look like now?\n\n* What technological or social adjustments do you think would be necessary?", "created_at": "2020-03-16 14:32:29.065521", "updated_at": "2020-03-28 17:33:53.917255", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 94, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 73.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 73501, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 12844, "post_number": 8, "raw": "ok but still you know there is much to be said for dressing up (both as teacher and as student).  during WW1 i think i heard that they insisted soldiers brush their teeth even in the trenches, yes hygiene but also the psychological effect is real.

Northern Italy is the home to a healthy industry around firearms and assorted weaponry. Everything is overboard. Workers are well treated and unionized. Companies pay their taxes and sponsor cultural events. They say they \"supply police forces\" and \"national defense systems\", and they do. But they also make dark, cruel products. \n\nOne such company, called [Valsella](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valsella_Meccanotecnica), was destroyed by a massive scandal in the 1990s, when it became known it was selling anti-personnel landmines to Iraq, later deployed in the Gulf War and against the Kurdish populations. The political pressure became too strong, and the company had to fold. \n\nIn Internet Tech, too, Italians have their own dark history. If you have been paying attention, you will remember a company called Hacking Team ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacking_Team#Controversies)), who sold offensive intrusion and surveillance systems to governments like Sudan, Venezuela or Saudi Arabia. This became known in 2015, when the company was itself hacked, and internal documents put on BitTorrent and picked up by Wikileaks. The scandal led to the Italian government revoking the company's license to sell  spyware outside of Europe. \n\nSo what to do? Not sure. Double edges are an integral part of innovation. The printing press was developed to print indulgence certificates, and its \"venture investor\" was the archbishop of Mainz; but it was immediately appropriated by Martin Luther's reformers to condemn the practices of selling indulgences. It was also used to print bibles, pornographic literature, advertisements, etc. etc.  It comes down to whether you believe in liberal democracy. If you do, you build an elaborate system of checks and balances, and hope for the best. \n\nIt would also help to break the alignment between obvious evils like imprisonment and torture and profit. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortes says that prisons should *never, ever* be run by private companies, and I can see where she is coming from.

I think we should mention somewhere that out of respect for growing ranks of public sector innovators out there, the 3 year prototype will be an exercise of self-reflection and refining of the narrative the Fellows choose to state outwards.\n* **Commitment from the Fellows**: \nOne issue is: Now what we say is that the Fellowship Package has 2 components: 1) personalized learning journey 2) common across all: contributing to creating the Camp. I would replace 2) with a common commitment to sharing generously about their work, their learning with the others.  Also here I would specify re: Language issues - that contributions and communication on the platform will come in in the language of the Fellow, and translation services will be used to loop in the entire community. Regular summaries in 2-3 main languages will be provided by community managers and translators to facilitate access to information by all.\nAnother issue is commitment overall: how much time a Fellow is required and realistic to spend sharing the knowledge and interacting inside the program's community; but it also means how much time can be secured from their current job or as an addition to it. Since this is a design specification which should probably not be included in the concept note, I would advise we keep it generic, and avoid the following:\n* **Co-creation of the Fellows Camp (unrealistic)** - reading this now feels highly unrealistic because collaborative online work and coordination to build any event, especially an international one, takes a lot of time. Not to mention the language issues - how not all Fellows will be confortable using English, especially on the (public) platform. This should be the goal of a committee or the core staff of the Program, whose process will be to request periodic input from the Fellows at an affordable cost of time.\n* **Fellows Camp** To keep it realistic, I would advise that the Camp is an internal event for deep sharing between Fellows, and between Fellows and alumni. This is already there. But also a deep self-reflection about the Program, since this is the one opportunity a year we could do it collectively. In the more public part of the camp - this could be a 1 day Summit, with more partners, investors and general PR, but not more, since this would eat a lot of resources and we are looking at a prototype still. \n\nWhat is missing or is not emphasized enough (?)\n\n* **The role in the program for senior management and other active supporters**. We talk about changing organisational culture through initially changing the behaviors of individuals. This could be achieved more rapidly if senior officials are made part of the program's activities to the best of their availability. Also, becoming 'active ambassadors' or any other invented role could be helpful - already to add it as a core Activity (page 9). It is mentioned, but not visible enough.\nThis is important to support senior mgmt as well to get their heads clear around the mindset of innovation. What Annibale mentioned it in the retreat: _I discovered that in top management collaboration tables in a change management program, focus was on very simple question. Why are you doing this? What are your expectations for the future? It was incredible because they were not able to answer, they answered with the rules of civil code._ Or what Millie mentioned about often UNDP people trying to solve the wrong problem; or  _the higher value conversation. How do you sell systems mapping to a mayor?_\n\nDoes this help?", "created_at": "2019-09-10 09:30:12.519423", "updated_at": "2019-09-10 09:36:11.390052", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 664, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 32.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24463, "user_id": 1450, "topic_id": 3478, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>parasitic vs self-sufficient</b>\n\n[warning: just thinking in text. not directly relevant to the immediate topic]\n\nAlso, there seem to be 2 fairly distinct categories of self-supply:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>those which are parasitic on the existing industrial economy, taking advantage of its waste and carelessness (e.g. dumpster-diving or squatting)</li>\n\n<li>those which do not rely on the existing economy</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nCategory (1) is where many of the immediate quick wins are. e.g. you can freecycle many of your material needs without that much difficult.

You probably can't start a one-woman fab-lab or self-sufficient farm.\n\nSo the value of (1) is mainly as a stepping-stone to (2).

BUT, we know how we should move for the environment, and how if we think sustainability, if we think long term, then people should be aware of how serious our environmental issues are.\nFor that, we are going to be part of the Edgeryders Hackathon series that are going to be delivered in the MENA region, to raise awareness, to tackle our problems and solve them!\n\nThe challenge will be: How can technology help today address the urging environmental and agricultural issues? How can it help achieve the following Sustainable Development Goals? \n* SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation\n* SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy\n* SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities\n* SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production\n* SDG 13: Climate Action\n* SDG 14: Life Below Water\n* SDG 15: Life on Land\n\nAll participating teams in all Hackathons will be invited into choosing one or more of the above SDGs to work on, and come up with solutions to address it/them and achieve the goals set by the UN. \n\n**Why should you participate?**\n\n1. It is a community based event so you will be working with extraordinary people who believe in CHANGE.\n2. There will be interesting workshops and webinars with EXPERTS from the Edgeryders community that will guide you through the way to develop your solution into a real sustainable product.\n3. There will be prizes that will help turn your prototype into reality:\n\n     * The first two winning teams from each Hackathon will win an online incubation with OCI LAB, and an access of a total budget of 15k $ available to all 8 teams to develop their MVPs.\n    * The third, fourth and fifth winning teams from each Hackathon will win an online incubation with OCI LAB, and if more funding will be available in the future, they will benefit from it.\n\n**How to be part of the Hackathon?**\n\nAll you have to do now is filling a form which will be available soon and shared by organizers. In the meanwhile, we invite you to create you onw account, introduce yourself and tell us about your aspirations so Edgeryders community will get to know you :) \n\n**Want to contribute?**\nIf you feel like you can be part of one of these hackathons, that you can help the teams protoype their ideas and help the develop them into real solutions, then please join us!\nWe appreciate each single contribution and just leave us a comment here to inform us about your contribution :wink: \n\n**How is this event being organized?**\n\nThis event is organized as part of the Edgeryders' festival. All hackathons that will be organized in the MENA region at the same time. Each event is a community based event and it is coordinated on the Edgeryders' platform, like all previous events organized.\nThe MENA region.

I will start by elaborate a bit more on what the initiative is about and where we are and finally get back how beneficial Hugi would be for our success.\n\n**The vision:** Our vision is to ultimately save lives during the ongoing Corona crisis by easing the load of the healthcare and crisis management systems. Initially, this is mainly the official hotlines for healthcare (1177) and crisis information (11313). To symbolize the need - the latter number alone has gone from 25 daily calls to over 35000 the last week.\n\n**The solution:** Our solution is a chatbot that can answer questions and provide support by telephone and text-chat in various channels (websites, FB messenger, mobile apps). We are focusing on the most common and general questions sourced from official sources. We have contacts with Folkh\u00e4lsomyndigheten, the Swedish health ministry who is the thought-leader in the national crisis management. They love our initiative and are interested in supporting us - we are now trying to work out how.\n\n**Technology:** Technically, the bot uses state-of-the-art AI tools together with automatically fetched content from official sources, curated by a team of volunteer content editors. Since the need for accurate content is crucial, it is manually reviewed and curated through a content editing tool that allows the volunteer editors to work efficiently and teach the AI to become better over time and adjust itself whenever new information gets out.\n\n**Team:** The team consists of several experts in building conversational apps - myself included - and strong developers, designers and marketeers.

One of the ways we have been experimenting is by running a kind of peer to peer incubator online. We start by reaching out to people who have done some work already on a promising solution (e.g have a well thought through concept, have done the science or technology development or already have an initiative up and running). And then we mobile people who can support their work either in person (put in their knowledge,  time, skills, connections) or provide resources (materials, equipment, money etc). The first iteration began last year and is now coming to an end with 14 initiatives having \"graduated\" form the program.

Sicily\u2019s economy and society have long been crippled by high unemployment, inefficient public services, corruption and organized crime. Yet, over the past decade so, a small cohort of about 120 enterprises in Messina, working closely together, have managed to build a solid, long-termist, fair, human-centric economy \u2013 and achieve stability and prosperity in the process. They call themselves an  \u201cadvanced cluster\u201d.\n\nThere other cases like this. Europe is alive with eco-villages, neo-cooperatives, neo-municipalist cities, post-capitalist entrepreneurs, local currencies. Some of the local economies they build are so unfamiliar they might as well be alien. \n\nIn this listening session we will discuss the Messina case, and other creative responses to economic and social crises. We will look into the challenges they faced and enabling conditions that enabled them to thrive. Using them as a point of departure to reflect together on what we can put in place now to better equip us all for the transition to a green, inclusive and resilient local economies.\n\nThis event is part of the [ Progressive Governance Digital Summit 2020 ](https://progressive-governance.eu) and is co-hosted by the Foundation for European Progressive Studies (FEPS).\n\n### Format:\n* A Zoom meeting. \n* **Short presentation of our featured \"speakers\" + open, moderated discussion**. To frame the discussion, we will do an initial round of short introductions of the cases and our featured participants. A moderator will then give the floor to people who want to contribute something. If you want to share your point of view, use the call\u2019s chat to let us know, and the moderator will give you the floor. If you have a question to ask the speaker, ask it in the chat (better) or let us know you want to ask a question. Questions are taken before we move on to the next speaker.\n* **We commit to doing a proper writeup of the result**  (aka \u201cdocumentation, or it didn\u2019t happen\u201d).

People could either use sub-tasks or notes, depending on their time tracker software. More or less any time tracker will be able to do this, so our process is tool-agnostic.\n\nAnd then once per year before our reporting deadline, they'll have to upload their full timekeeping records, in the original format and all useful export formats which their time tracker provides. If they keep their time tracking data inside FreeAgent, they are settled already and don't have to do anything extra.\n\nWe'll then spot-check that data while doing the yearly reporting tasks, to make sure it is detailed enough and aligns with the monthly signed time records. But due to the mess of formats and numbers, there is no economic way to do a full check. So to a degree, we will have to trust users that they simply took over the data from their time tracker into the signed time records, as they should. But at least we'll have detailed data in store for an audit, and we avoid more admin and copy&paste tasks around this.\n\nIt's not \"proper IT\" this way, but any real solution would quickly get out of hand: Kamai v2 + approval process + audit log + sync with a desktop time tracker like `tom-ui`.\n\n[quote=\"alberto, post:45, topic:9143\"]I am not sure what \"Pomodoro break\" means[/quote]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique", "created_at": "2019-02-18 14:45:53.778071", "updated_at": "2019-02-18 14:45:53.778071", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 283, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 12.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [50946], "is_reply_to": [50946], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 71803, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 12899, "post_number": 1, "raw": "*(This is a wiki, feel free to add to it.

Introduction by the host focused on 3 questions and challenges today like never before:\n\n* How do we play the pandemic network game? -> we need to collaborate more and better (Andreea, program director from Community Foundation Galati).\n* How do we generate cashflow for our beneficiaries?\n* How do we generate active communities beyond our usual bubble?\n\nWe had community coordinators, volunteers, experts, and network experts in the room:\n\n* Ruxandra: local coordinator of a community program for STEM education, Fondul \u0218tiin\u021bescu.\n* Marius: board president of the Gala\u021bi Community Foundation 'If we would have set up this call/event live, we wouldn't have had so many people' :slight_smile:\n* Alexandru: expert on migration\n* Cristina: grants manager at the Bucharest Community Foundation\n* Alexandra: participation consultant and community facilitator asking how can orgs working with local communities can offer support in light of the deep shifts happening\n* Manu: worked on a lot of projects for social innovation and especially incubation\n* Mihai: coordinator of [a capacity building program](http://www.educab.org/) equipping libraries with books in 12 countries\n* Alin: founder of CoderDojo in Pitesti (south Romania)\n* \u2026 and others\n\nManu is a social innovator and like me, used to the online, but has been disappointed with the messiness of the Internet and wanted something more structured. Takeaway: in their social business incubation program, Manu and his team test for minimum viable online interactions, so that the time and community management is more efficiently used relative to the offline!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Some of the burning topics we talked about:**\n\n\n## 1. How can foundations with ongoing programs build or increase their online presence and reach to not lose momentum? \n\nI read this as a need to stay relevant, in the way of not losing contact with the populations they serve through their very existance. Some projects - like technical innovation among high schoolers, can be repurposed with an online component because youth will be quick adopters. But others, like Marathons, cannot happen online.\n\nWe kept getting this question of: 'What are some recipes for moving activities online? For having a useful presence there?'\nUnfortunately this is not cookie cutter. It needs strategic considerations,  and for the how: we would need to spend a couple of days together to integrate some ideas into their way of working. Sorry, but it's not as easy!\n\nA great list of civic/social initiatives in Romania working to help relieve the corona crisis:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1pX4V6hTx9f4Oe8aNofhx_ePeDAE8PNEYRjox4NhnW6w/edit\n\n\n## 2. Emergency responses: How do you keep your community alive and cashflow support to those who need the resources? \n\nWe talked a lot about the need to repurpose resources and redirect requests to those organisations already equipped to do crisis relief! My own advice was to even drop projects, if the cost is too high to get them through the noise in today's communications, which are anyway mostly focused on corona. These efforts might clog the channels, more than do good.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Next steps for this group:**\n\n* a few hours of people to look into each other's issues + resources\n* new calls focused on a specific question", "created_at": "2020-03-19 16:03:44.806478", "updated_at": "2020-05-18 09:00:45.137677", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 600, "wiki": true, "reads": 19, "score": 153.8, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [6353, 6358, 6360, 5547, 2580, 6431], "is_private": false}, {"id": 85830, "user_id": 6796, "topic_id": 14673, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<br>\nProblem sa kojim se suo\u010davamo je sveop\u0161ti jer poljoprivredni giganti nadiru sa svih strana. Goru\u0107e pitanje glasi: kako podi\u0107i nivo svesti i odvratiti male poljoprivredne proizvo\u0111a\u010de od konvencionalne proizvodnje? Mnogi hranu proizvode na tradicionalan na\u010din, ali, kako ih ubediti da kontrolisano koriste sredstva za za\u0161titu bilja? \n\nSrbija ima male proizvo\u0111a\u010de. Pre nego \u0161to smo se poput mese\u010dara uteturali u ratove a kasnije i u neoliberalno carstvo kojim dominira filozofija \u201eprvo tr\u017ei\u0161te, a onda \u010dovek\u201c, pojedinac je imao pravo na 20 hektara obradive zemlje - dovoljno da prehrani porodicu, a ne\u0161to je ostajalo i za tr\u017ei\u0161te. \n\nMe\u0111utim, primer obrade zemlje u Vojvodini je indikativan. Tamo se paori decenijama bave intenzivnom poljoprivrednom proizvodnjom, uz veliko smanjenje upotrebe stajnjaka u korist ve\u0161ta\u010dkih \u0111ubriva. Posledice: debljina sloja humusa se smanjuje nezapam\u0107enom brzinom ba\u0161 kao i svuda gde je gajenje industrijskih biljaka, u monokulturi, zamenilo tradicionalnu poljoprivrednu proizvodnju. Na\u0161e Udru\u017eenje se bori upravo protiv toga. Pro\u0161le godine smo objavili priru\u010dnik pod nazivom \u201e[Prehrambeni suverenitet u kontekstu Srbije](http://amacentar.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Prehrambeni-suverenitet-u-kontekstu-Srbije.pdf)\u201c koji se bavi ovim problemom. Pojam prehrambenog suvereniteta nije nov, ali se svodi na to da ne zavisimo od uvoza hrane, da proizvodimo dovoljno hrane za sve stanovnike svoje zemlje i da imamo suverenitet nad proizvodnjom hrane koju jedemo, \u0161to se kosi sa poretkom na po\u010detku XXI veka: u ime slobodne trgovine, moraju se po\u0161tovati sumnjivi ugovori potpisani sa me\u0111unarodnim organizacijama, od \u201evelikih\u201c se mora uvoziti hrana \u010dija se proizvodnja u njihovim zemljama podsti\u010de gigantskim subvencijama, a obradivo zemlji\u0161te se mora prodavati kompanijama iz inostranstva, \u010desto iz zemalja koje nikada nisu imale uslove za tradicionalnu poljoprivrednu proizvodnju, poput \u201eAl Dahre\u201c iz Ujedinjenih Arapskih Emirata.\n\nOblast mog interesovanja je jugoisto\u010dna Srbija. Smatram da je decentralizacija klju\u010dno pitanje, \u010dak i u oblasti prehrambenog suvereniteta. Ono \u0161to va\u017ei na Staroj planini ne\u0107e va\u017eiti u Vojvodini. Me\u0111utim, tradicionalna \u0161kola mi\u0161ljenja je poljoprivrednike decenijama ube\u0111ivala da prestanu da hranu proizvode \u201estarovremski\u201c, i to je postalo njihov na\u010din razmi\u0161ljanja. Kako se izboriti sa ovim na\u010dinom razmi\u0161ljanja kod ljudi koji su godinama kljukani narativom tradicionalnih agronoma i velikih zadruga, a sada im govorimo da treba da rade kako su radili njihovi dedovi?\n\nPro\u0161le godine smo u Srbiji i Hrvatskoj obavili istra\u017eivanje i objavili studiju pod naslovom \u201e[Mladi poljoprivrednici i prehrambeni suverenitet](http://amacentar.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Mladi-poljoprivrednici-i-prehrambeni-suverenitet-STUDIJA.pdf)\u201c za \u0161ta su sredstva delom obezbe\u0111ena iz programa \u201eErasmus+\u201c Evropske Unije. U istra\u017eivanju je u\u010destvovalo nekoliko desetina mladih poljoprivrednika iz obe zemlje. Problem za koji smo se svi pravili da ga ne vidimo je bilo to \u0161to se mnogi bave konvencionalnom poljoprivredom i gajenjem visokorodnih sorti industrijskog bilja. Me\u0111utim, na\u0161 prvenstveni cilj je o\u010duvanje biodiverziteta, a sve ostalo je na drugom mestu - ako to zna\u010di manje prinose, neka tako bude. Sada dolazimo do novog problema: veliki trgovinski lanci su u stanju da poljoprivredne proizvode prodaju jeftino ili po dampin\u0161kim cenama, \u0161to zna\u010di da je njihova cena u Srbiji ni\u017ea nego u zemlji proizvodnje.

Big ecstatic dance fan :)\n\n---\n\n### WorldBrain.io\nI founded WorldBrain.io, a steward ownership business with the goal of battling online misinformation and societal polarisation at scale. We are building open-source tools for people to organise their online research, and build on other people's research to understand complext topics quicker, deeper and with more nuance. Our tools are focused on providing maximum data sovereignty and freedom to move between providers - so no social or data lock-ins and full room for innovating on knowledge management tools. \nThe two main tools we are developing are **Memex** and **Storex**. \nAlso involved are @allegra and @JuliaV.  \n\n---\n\n### Memex\nMemex is a browser extension to organise your web research more efficiently. \nIt's a mix of \n1. a Google Search for everything you have seen in the past \n2. Medium's/GDocs highlighting and commenting features but for the whole web and\n3. Pocket's quick organisation features supercharged. You can also save & archive tweets. \n\nMemex runs entirely locally, sync between devices happens P2P. All data is stored on your computer. \nHere you can play with it: [worldbrain.io](http://worldbrain.io)\n![com-optimize%20(30)|690x413](upload://oqouoQrAsQOleXR2azWEXNvamXM.gif) \n\nMemex is in an MVP stage currently used by 10.000 people and already generating small revenue. \nWe just won the LEDGER Open call and got 200k to add collaboration features to Memex. \nImagine being able to search for &quot;lithium mining&quot; across all the websites and papers Elon Musk has read, and seeing and responding to his highlights and notes.\n\n---\n\n### Storex\nWe know that Memex is not going to be useful to everyone and that everyone needs different tools to organise and share their nuanced digital knowledge that is spread across so many services. \nThere is a need for many different tools that are adapted to individuals workflows and requirements. \n\nAnd that is one of the reasons we built Storex: To democratise knowledge creation, ownership and exchange.\nStorex is the main storage, syncing, searching and sharing library for the data produced with Memex. \nWe are about to add an API so that developers and entrepreneurs can have full access to innovate on their own data. (history, annotations, notes, tags, interaction metadata, browsing paths, content of everything visited)\nSince Memex is open source they therefore can copy & modify it, add new features that fit their workflows better and still use the same data, or even use 2 Memexes in parallel. But of course you don't need to build another Memex. You can also just build a connection to one of your favourite apps, \nWe think there is a lot of potential for this community to experiment and build on such an infrastructure. \nFor example Edgeryders own crowdtagging platform could build an integration that collects the tags people of the community made and process them there, or people can build recommendation algorithms or autotagging features based on NLP data. \n\n--- \n\nI am looking forward to learn about your use cases. We are right now in the phase of gathering 10-20 interested projects to identify the common needs for such an infrastructure. Let me know if you'd like to chat more, or have any questions already.

percentage is used in making chairs and tables but in a very small scale as there is a very limited demand on that now.\n\nThe vision of our project is based on 4 main goals - 4 tracks- .Then environmental goal is to reduce wasting this resource-Palm midribs- to reduce the environmental damages .Economically this alternative wood industry would reduce the amount of wood import in Egypt which is for now 4 Billion Egyptian pounds .Also this would help socially in reducing poverty and unemployment  by providing job opportunities\n\nThe 4th track is the \"low\" technology track which we aim to achieve with it the most sustainable scenario for the project\n\n----------\n\n##:ar: _Arabic version_ <a

Most journals request keywords in a publication submission, and researchers tend to think their keywords through ([example](Uhttps://www.researchgate.net/profile/Saeed_Ul_Hassan/publication/257663382_Small-world_phenomenon_of_keywords_network_based_on_complex_network/links/5459bda10cf2cf516483daf4/Small-world-phenomenon-of-keywords-network-based-on-complex-network.pdf)). \n\n[quote=\"martin, post:3, topic:10650\"]\na tool that is generating \u2018descriptors\u2019 from the profiles may deliver a starting data sett (e.g. a word-cloud created for each profile)\n[/quote]\n\nThat's what the NLP literature calls a \"topic\".

In return for being able to witness your project come to life. we will  offer you the contacts and networking tools we have built up over the last  years and all the support we can within and outside of the Haven network.\nArtists are welcome to stay in the Haven House for a minimum of 1 month and up to 3 months during which they are welcome to  collaborate with any artists, or on an ongoing project that is happening in Haven, provided all parties are agreeable. Furthermore, artists  are encouraged to produce and create at every possible opportunity, and  to take part in Haven events.  We also believe in change and that with art, change is imperative.  If projects, evolve or take on a different form than was originally  proposed, or if a project is replaced with a new idea, Haven will  maintain support and assistance of the artist and their overall project.   \n\nHaven encourages artists to share their skills with Havenhouse attendees,  Haven staff and other Haven artists. This could be  through the form of workshops, discussions or classes. Haven works on-one-on-one basis, so the Haven team is happy to brainstorm ideas prior to  any artist taking up residency. We believe in collaborative knowledge and  skill sharing, and see this as an important element of the residencies;  However, the  artist\u2019s own project takes primary importance, so a suitable  schedule will be worked out together.  Haven will also provide a \u2018Welcome to Beirut\u2019 package, with information about the city, locations of key art resources, museums,  sites etc. The Haven team will also be available to assist you with daily logistical needs, and will provide support for your visa applications (where relevant), and copy-editing support for the artists future funding applications.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/aa4c79d920cb823af78fa54b52ba73bc63196177.jpeg\" width=\"690\" height=\"517\"><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/8/82f432e9200cadadceb7137190ccc80692b14d0f.jpeg\" width=\"690\" height=\"517\"><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5f6f942266c3e6af5a2693cb4d69e302546434e0.jpeg\" width=\"690\" height=\"517\"><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/2/21fa89b75a238ec171a3c4574a79c258c855c507.jpeg\" width=\"690\" height=\"517\">", "created_at": "2017-09-10 15:50:30.557134", "updated_at": "2017-09-10 15:50:30.557134", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 378, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 91.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [35774], "is_liked_by": [1935, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 72978, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 13016, "post_number": 6, "raw": "Found this article that gives some historical context as to why it seems we are underresourced when it comes to disaster preparedness.

From a national health system capable of paying you even thermal therapy to one where if you need to see a specialist for a serious disease you can wait for months ...or just book an appointment for the next day if you can pay the private-practice fee.\nI moved to Brussels for specialising in Pediatrics -(access to specialised training in different countries could be another interesting topic, but too many things to say for resuming everything in one post!)- and had the chance to work in different multicultural contexts: Brussels city-center, Antwerp travel clinic, Burundi's rural hospital. \nWhat really caught my attention was how children health was related to some very specific cultural-related aspects. There are of course the well-known social determinants of health, but that's not all, or at least the way we deal with them as health worker is trivial.\nAm I doing my job as a Pediatrician if I am not doing something for empowering mothers, for helping them in creating social networks, in having access to instruction, to healthy nutrition, safe shelter, gender equality? \nI strongly believe Health is a social result and my job as a doctor will never be accomplished if I do not go out from hospitals, clinics, cabinets, if I do not act firstly as a citizen.\n\nThen let's have a look to the other face. I am a patient too, as anyone is at a certain moment in life -hopefully just a transient moment!-.\nI was confronted to the weaknesses of Occidental medicine: when I see a specialist that only looks to my blood results and never to my eyes do I feel heal? He will probably solve my medical problem, but where is caring? Is that enough? Aren't we loosing something with this dichotomy? Sometimes, in spite of a very scientific vision of life, I prefer to look for alternative medicines as a patient, exactly because of this need for an holistic vision.\n\nI often think to the ancient hawaiian healing practice of Ho\u02bboponopono. The definition in the Hawaiian Dictionary is: \"To put to rights; to put in order or shape, correct, revise, adjust, amend, (...); to make ready, as canoemen preparing to catch a wave.\" Illness is considered as a problem of the whole family (or even society), and the solution is then thought as a social practice too.\nWhat could we learn from that?\n\nFrom a very practical point of view I am sure that a lot can be done, and thinking about how to create and empower social networks is one of the keys for improving health. \nI think loneliness is one of the stronger social determinant of health in more and more industrialised societies: no solution can be thought without a systemic and partecipative vision.

What is your idea? <a name=\"chap-1\"></a>\n\nWe propose a first-of-kind composting toilet system designed for large-scale use in cities. It is microbiologically safe, uses simple processes, produces sellable agricultural soil and is meant to be cheaper for cities to deploy and operate than sewered sanitation. The components are as follows:\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6bc26cbbf5cd0821c9ad4076afc0da761f0f9f83.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"364\">\n\n1.  **Composting toilet** with urine separation.\n2.  **Odor extraction system**, using tubes, a fan, and a photovoltaics panel. It also dries the feces.\n3.  **Feces container** for 250-300 l or about 170-200 kg of semi-dried feces.\n4.  **Stairs-going sack barrow**, customized for transporting the feces containers. Mechanical versions operated by two people are the standard. An electrical version for one person is possible.\n5.  **Vehicle with a lift or ramp** to transport the feces containers from the nearest road access point.\n6.  **Urine tank** (below floor level). Emptied by a tanker vehicle with suction hose. (Out of scope for the proposal at this stage, however.)\n7.  **Steam autoclave**, customized for the feces containers. In the utility scale version large enough for many feces containers. Possibly locally made with reinforced concrete.\n8.  **Composting and soil mixing plant**.\n9.  **Management software** to organize the logistics of the feces containers. Including a feature to predict when containers are probably full and should be exchanged, and automatic tour planning.\n\nThe toilet rests on top of the feces container. A visual and odor barrier opens when sitting down on the toilet seat, while a small solar-powered fan extracts odors from the tank. When full, the container is sealed and exchanged by a professional crew on request, using the special sack barrow and a vehicle. It is then autoclaved as a whole, which is possible for a container made from polypropylene, aluminium or stainless steel. This prevents *any* handling of potentially infectious, unsanitized feces. After heat sterilization, the (now harmless) container contents are composted, mixed with rock dust and organic matter to form fertile soil, and the soil is sold to farmers. Due to this revenue source, container collection can be a free service.\n\nA successful product requires the right tuning of parameters. In this case, the right scale of the feces container is critical: small containers need frequent handling, usually by end users, which is unsafe and socially unacceptable; large containers (like 1 m\u00b3 IBC tanks) are not suitable for transport in narrow courtyards and streets; and the even larger septic tanks are expensive to build, pose groundwater risks, and require unsafe open handling of feces for emptying them. The best scale for urban settings is our medium-sized 300 l container: it fits under a toilet, needs infrequent emptying (after 3 person years of use), and can be transported with a sack barrow up and down stairs and through narrow passages.\n\nOur approach is unconventional as at-source collection of human waste is not practiced in cities. However, we argue that it is the way to go because (1) the food economy must be circular if we are to solve the issues of soil nutrient depletion, topsoil loss and water eutrophication, (2) collecting and sterilizing human feces before they mix with water or touch anything is microbiologically the safest approach in developing areas and (3) both installation and operation are cheaper than that of a sewered sanitation system with a sewage treatment plant. Claims (2) and (3) will be tested in this project.\n\nWe estimate a high probability of success because we designed a system that respects the operational constraints: social acceptability, use incentives, simple and safe processes for developing areas, independence from fragile infrastructure (like grid electricity and client-side electronics), usability in constrained urban spaces, and extreme affordability (because the toilets themselves are \u201clow-tech\u201d).\n\n\n## 2. How will you test your idea? <a name=\"chap-2\"></a>\n\nWe will develop and build several (4-10) prototypes of the proposed toilets, tanks and the sack barrow. We will rent (or if necessary build) a steam autoclave fitting for one container, as used for sterilizing soil in mushroom farms. We will perform extensive, long-term, real-world testing of all components, use the resulting compost and soil on a test plot, and test it microbiologically and for soil quality. All of this will happen in Kathmandu Valley, Nepal, an urban agglomeration of 5 million without wastewater processing.\n\nWe will use online and offline ethnography to collect and evaluate feedback and input from users of the toilet, from those handling the containers and autoclave, from local politicians and citizens in general. With this, data from the prototype use, and input from industry about production costs, we will create a detailed report of the feasibility, design and cost of introducing and operating the proposed system at city scale. We will also include risks and ways to mitigate them, esp. related to cultural sensitivities and social acceptance. The report will include detailed instructions how to manufacture the system locally. All intellectual property incl. the reports and management software will be licenced and published under open source licences.\n\nIf we find the proposed system to be technologically feasible and economically attractive, we will contact city administrations in Nepal and beyond and at first propose a deployment for 5,000 \u2013 20,000 people. Scale will increase with follow-up projects until reaching full city scale. We intend to work as tech consultants for city administrations to promote the proposed technology instead of starting a manufacturing company. This keeps capital costs down and allows cities to source the system components from local, existing manufacturers. We\u2019re also open to consult for private companies, if their container exchange service is free for end users.\n\nIn case there are technical difficulties with the proposed system, we may require some funding for further research and development. One possible area of concern is the energy use of the autoclaves.\n\n\n## 3. Project time plan and cost breakdown <a name=\"chap-3\"></a>\n\n_[Not included here.]_\n\n\n## 4. Variations, extensions, additional ideas <a name=\"chap-4\"></a>\n\n_This section was not included in the application sent off due to space constraints._\n\n**Towards a circular food economy.** It is quite amazing how food is completely recyclable. The body extracts chemical energy but leaves the atoms intact (obviously). So by composting feces and urine into soil and agriculturing soil into plants, a low-tech closed loop recycling is possible. It could even be automated to a large degree. This way, there is neither soil loss, soil exhaustion nor nutrient deficiency in the food. Which means that composting toilets and agricultural use of feces is certainly the right way to go.\n\n**Challenges of dry toilets in cities.** The main problem with dry toilets in cities is social acceptance. From [a failed experiment](https://www.pri.org/stories/2011-05-31/chinas-failed-experiment-dry-toilets) with dry toilets in China: \"[Dry toilets with a bucket] are ill-matched for the aspirations of urban middle class life. What\u2019s unacceptable is you have to carry a bucket of your own feces down for composting.\". Also, it is difficult to adapt non-sewerage sanitation to the density of cities (for an overview, see [here](http://www.eautarcie.org/en/05a.html)). However, the system proposed here is (hopefully) an exception.\n\n**Soil, not biochar.** The end product here is soil, not biochar as in many other systems. That seems to be the \"right\" solution in order to return all nutrients to the soil in biologically active form.\n\n**Use of litter material.** Moderate amounts of litter should be used in the dry toilet, but it is not essential.\n\n**On ventilation.** The toilet will use forced ventilation but close very tightly, so that the ventilation only turns on when the toilet is in use. This way, there will be no odor issues outside even when all households use these toilets. Obviously this also means that feces are not dried by air motion, but that is not an issue: it's not worth the energy input, as the end product (soil) can use the humidity.\n\n**Indirect autoclave heating.** The heat might come from vacuum tube type thermal solar collectors with a high-temperature heat fluid (150 \u00b0C silicone oil).\n\n**Direct solar autoclave containers.** This is probably the best solution so far, as it does not need separate autoclaves and works with \"just sunlight\". For this, the feces container itself has to be pressure-proof for working pressures of ca. 2 bar pressure differential (as seen in 120-130 \u00b0C steam during sterilization). For testing purposes, stainless steel 200 l beer barrels are good options, while for serial production barrels welded from aluminium sheet metal can be used.\n\n&nbsp; These containers are closed with a pressure-proof lid, painted black on the outside and a pressure gauge is added. For better heat retention (in cold areas or where direct sunshine collector surface is rare) it is optionally possible to place the container inside a cylindrical enclosure made from heatproof glass sheets connected by metal elements.\n\n&nbsp; Now, the containers are raised into the focal point of a small concentrating solar power plant and rotated slowly. Rotation allows the heat to be taken up faster by the material and also allows the steam developing from water in the material to penetrate the material faster as well, as it is all exposed to it at some time. When the sun goes down, heating can be resumed the next day (as total time spent at a certain temperature and pressure is essential for sterilization, not an uninterrupted process). When there is no direct sun, there is no rush: the plant will have enough spare containers and wait for the sun to come back. In total, this is a pretty low-cost, low tech form of sterilization. Of course, it needs a large area that receives enough direct sun.\n\n**Solar electrical autoclave containers.** This is probably an even better solution than exposing autoclave containers to concentrated sunlight, because it allows to use the grid as a buffer and thus works also on cloudy days (taking grid electricity as a supplement) and can also supply energy to the grid when not all is needed locally.\n\n&nbsp; The cheapest and most practical option in this case will be to use aluminium containers that are not pressure-proof and loaded into an autoclave. These containers would however have multiple aluminium tubes going through the container, open on both sides, in a grid of 10\u00d710 cm to 15\u00d715 cm. These stabilize the container walls but, more importantly, allow to insert electrical heating rods using nicro wire, heated by either 230 V AC grid electricity or 230 V DC solar electricity, depending on which is available, with switchover possible every few seconds. Both will result in the same heat output since 230 V AC is the effective (averaged) voltage. Since there are many heating rods and aluminium is a good heat conductor, heating the content up to sterilization temperatures will be possible much faster than with an alternative system of contact only to the outside surface of the container.\n\n&nbsp; To save energy, a second device would contain a fluid-based heat exchanger that transfers heat from already sterilized to cold feces containers. Using several steps for this, perhaps 60-70% of the heat can be recovered. For that heat transfer, the same through-holes in the containers can be used, just this time routing hot or cold water through them.\n\n**Use the soil on farms, not in the city.** For social acceptance, city people probably don't want to see the end products of their feces again. Farmers however have no such issues, they are used to animal manure already and will recognize heat-sterilized humanure as a safe, great fertilizer. Also, there will not be much use for so much soil in a city anyway, and the soil has to be restored where it was depleted: on farms.\n\n**Use the urine on farms as well.** Urine would be stored for 6 months (or also heat treated) to render it safe and then transported to rural locations. Here, it would be automatically mixed with water and be available for free to farmers at a dispensing point. For the urine of each one person, a garden of 250 m\u00b2 will be needed to prevent groundwater eutrophication (see [here](http://www.eautarcie.org/en/05a.html)), which is not possible in cities.\n\n**Alternative containers for larger houses.** For large apartment blocks, esp. newly built ones that can be built around this new toilet system, 1000 l [IBC tank pallets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_bulk_container) are a much better option. Due to its size, it only has to be emptied every 6-7 person years (so 2-3 years with 2-3 people in an apartment). The toilet can be mounted above it, or at floor level if the IBC ends flush with floor level due to a special construction of the house. In this case, an elevator with \"secret\" intermediate stops can be built and then is used together with a normal pallet truck to exchange these containers without even having to enter people's flats.\n\n**Existing IBC based dry toilet.** There is a great Instructable on an IBC based outhouse toilet: [part 1](https://www.instructables.com/id/The-Easy-Empty-Composting-Toilet-Project-Part-1-Gr/), [part 2](https://www.instructables.com/id/The-Easy-Empty-Composting-Toilet-Project-Part-2-Su/). Interesting points include that composting only happens once the contents start to dry (having the lid open), and then progresses from top to bottom. However, this is when adding no litter (which is of course good to extend the use time of a IBC container). But using forced ventilation, drying could also happen during use.\n\n**IBC based public toilets.** Note that the solution with IBC containers can also easily be deployed for public toilets. That makes it immediately applicable as a solution for informal settlements / squatter areas of cities.\n\n**Decentralized composting with spare containers.** By having two feces containers in one household, next to each other, one can be composting the ingredients when full while the other is in use. Since composting takes less than a year, there is also plenty of time to call the service providers for exchanging the container after the compost is ready. This is basically \"distributed storage\" rather than storage and composting at a central facility, and this way also prevents odor problems at a central facility. \n\n**Using the system to dispose of food scraps.** The proposed toilets can double as indoor compost heaps for organic trash. This will probably be more comfortable to citizens than managing a separate organic trash bin, with all the stink and slimy dirt involved when having to empty and clean it. It makes the toilet tanks fill up faster (maybe twice as fast) but it is still manageable. Dry organic material like leaves and sawdust will have to be added to manage the humidity (avoiding \"stinky\" anorganic digestion), but the service providers can bring that when exchanging the container. Also, old paper can be used as well.\n\n**From feces disposal to feces mining.** The most amazing possibility in this system is that it transforms feces (but also urine) into a safe, valuable agricultural resource. So ideally, the business model would be profitable without charging users anything, solely from selling compost / soil. That seems possible, because with compost prices of [65 EUR/t](https://www.indiatoday.in/pti-feed/story/govt-offers-rs-1500-per-tonne-assistance-on-city-compost-sale-492101-2016-01-20) in developing countries or 90 EUR in developed countries, one container with 300 l or 250 kg of compost would be worth 16 - 22 EUR, certainly enough for free pickup in a city when using a system of combined, automatically optimized collection logistics.\n&nbsp; There could even be well-maintained and free to use but still profitable public toilets everywhere in cities. That is a bit of a stretch though, as the 200 g of semi-dried feces (equiv. to compost) of one defecation are worth only 0.013 EUR in raw materials. At the maximum of 100 users per day and toilet, that might allow cleaning a toilet once per day in a developing area. But we did not even include the labor to process the compost yet. Additionally, the compost has to be heated to sterilize it, which again costs something.\n\n**How much soil can be produced?** Let's assume an urban agglomeration with 5 million residents and no proper sewage treatment (that's Kathmandu Valley). A human being produces on average 100 kg of feces per year, which is 65% water. Drying as needed for use in compost / spoil might remove 45% water, leaving 55 kg. There will be some weight loss through CO<sub>2</sub> and methane during composting, so let's assume the yield is 45 kg of compost. At 5 million residents, that's 225,000 t compost per year, or 616 t per day, equivalent to 31 large dumptrucks carrying 20 t each. Adding other biomass to create soil and not just compost as a product, the yield can be 2-3 times higher (but is better done on the farms using the compost to prevent unnecessary transportation).\n\n**Usage incentives.** When households without any access to a sanitation solution get a clean, safe toilet where waste disposal costs nothing, that itself should be incentive enough. Where they already have a sewer connection, there are still incentives: they will no longer have to pay wastewater fees to the municipality (often based on the amount of freshwater used), they will save the water for flushing, and the installation of the standard model of the toilet might even be free as well in exchange for a long-term contract allowing the company free collection of the waste.\n\n**Preventing antibiotics contamination of the environment.** When excrements are collected at source, it is simple to solve one of the problems that still plague current central wastewater treatment plants: residues of medical drugs, esp. of antibiotics because they could induce antibiotics resistance. For that, homes would simply have a second, smaller separating dry toilet that people are required to use while they are on certain medications. Feces collected from these toilets would be burned, and likewise urine would be evaporated and the residues burned, eliminating all traces of antibiotics.\n\n**Alternative business model: charge a fee, but create forests for free.** Probably a better business model is to charge a fee to toilet users (or, in the case of informal settlements where people cannot afford it, to the city). If the fee is lower than usually charged for sewered sanitation, cities people still have an incentive to switch to this system. That fee enables to, on the other hand, provide a free service to the environment: using the soil produced with this system to plant forests on denuded mountains. This enables \"land based land reclamation\" by exploiting the fact that, due to climate change, forests are now viable at higher altitudes if only there would be soil. Also, this use of the soil will create even fewer social acceptance issues than its use on farms, and the forests can still be useful by using many plant species that produce fruits, sap or essential oils or are otherwise useful beyond their wood. Obviously, the land created this way can become quite valuable in the future, when productive land in cool locations is desirable.\n\n**It's 10% of the solution for CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in a low-emission country.** Assume a country like Nepal with no proper wastewater treatment at all and ca. 2 t CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per person and year. Let's assume the 100 kg of feces produced per person and year contain 33 kg carbon, which results in ca. 100 kg of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent. In addition, the forest growth enabled on soil created this way (using the business model above) might add another 100 kg of CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration per year. That's offsetting 200 kg / 2 t = 10% of a person's emissions. Of course, not all carbon contained in untreated wastewater goes into the air as methane or CO<sub>2</sub>, so this is only a rough calculation. But still, it's a meaningful and free way to offset CO<sub>2</sub> and it does not use up any previously useful land \u2013 instead, it creates useful land.\n\n**Using microwaves for drying and sterilization.** As can be observed from putting a slice of bread for three minutes into a microwave oven, microwaves are effective for heating and drying and even for conversion of organic matter to biochar. A great advantage of microwaves is that they heat the material volumetrically, which is much faster than heating through surface contact and usually also more efficient, as there is less time for heat to get lost. Microwave heating can be combined with the pressure vessel technique from above, since thick plastic tubes are both resistant to the pressure of heat sterilization (ca. 2 bars working pressure) and transparent to microwave radiation. And even if not, the plastic container can be placed inside a pressure vessel together with the microwave magnetrons, and that pressure vessel would be slowly pressurized with air to always counteract the pressure building up in the thin-walled plastic container inside it. This way, nothing will leave that plastic container during the heating process.", "created_at": "2018-11-12 23:35:07.292389", "updated_at": "2019-03-03 20:14:15.011026", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 3725, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 617.4, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3904, 3791, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 61222, "user_id": 5429, "topic_id": 11022, "post_number": 16, "raw": "I've smacked together a little plugin that should do the trick here:\nhttps://github.com/gdpelican/permit-api-cors/blob/master/plugin.rb\n\nI'll spin it up on a local instance this week to verify, and if so we should be able to get away with sticking that plugin onto the `edgeryders.eu` instance.\n\nLike you say, it would be dangerous if you have e.g. `Allow-Origin: *` set, but since we'll be whitelisting foreign domains it shouldn't be too scary a thing (as long as you trust `riot.im` / any other domains in the whitelist etc to not abuse it)", "created_at": "2019-10-13 10:13:46.271498", "updated_at": "2019-10-13 10:13:46.271498", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 105, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 56.8, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4022, 5, 4861], "is_private": false}, {"id": 85832, "user_id": 6658, "topic_id": 14673, "post_number": 3, "raw": "@noemi I don't know how to edit to be visually better.

In support of this priority, the Commission is reinforcing Green Deal-related research and innovation with this dedicated call for proposals under the current research and innovation programme - Horizon 2020.\n\n**What the call aims to do**\n\nThe Green Deal call will mobilise research and innovation to foster a just and sustainable societal transition aiming at \u2018leaving nobody behind\u2019.\n\nProjects are expected to deliver tangible and visible results relatively quickly and show how research and innovation can provide concrete solutions for the Green Deal main priorities.\n\nThis is why the call will support\n\n* pilot applications, demonstration projects and innovative products\n* innovation for better governance of the green and digital transition\n* social and value chain innovation\n\nIn addition to technological development and demonstration, the call encourages experimentation and social innovation for new ways to engage civil society and empower citizens.\n\nIn relation to the current pandemic, the call will contribute to the green and digital recovery and to increasing societal resilience for example in agriculture, biodiversity acceleration of renewables, clean transport and modernisation towards a clean and circular industry.\n\n**How is the call structured?**\n\nThe call contains 11 areas\n\n**Eight thematic areas** reflecting the key work streams of the European Green Deal. In each area, one or more topics addresses the challenges outlined in the respective stream. Topics target specific, high-impact technological and societal innovations that can help advance the sustainable transition relatively quickly.\n\n**Three horizontal areas** (strengthening knowledge; empowering citizens; and international cooperation) that cut across the eight thematic areas and offer a longer-term perspective in achieving the transformations set out in the European Green Deal.\n\nHere you can find the stakeholder feedback survey results on each of the call area pages below.

On the other hand, I value genuine heartfelt commitment, where you commit to staying (unless there is unavoidable danger or intolerable hardship in staying). As we become more economically interdependent (as I think we will be as our current economy unravels) we need to recognise as well that moving out is really hard to arrange sometimes. As it was in the old days for women in marriage. I'm not saying go back there, I am saying let's all work hard on doing the work of growth and development in ourselves and in relationship, so that there is (nearly) always a viable option for staying, supporting commitment. I happen to believe that this kind of commitment is also very good in the long term for our spiritual growth.\n\nI hope this makes sense of the importance I put on the living community, compared with the working community. We have got used to the idea that employment comes and goes. I would say, let's not get used to the idea that relationships and communities come and go, but instead that we all grow within them, and we find ways of strongly supporting other people growing as well. Hopefully, I look forward to this leading to stronger and more stable working relations as well, so that we can then have more long-term work stability. Not being stuck in the same work roles, of course: here too, we need to be growing and developing, and calling for more fulfillment in our working lives as well as our personal lives.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-20 09:46:04", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:06.560985", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 296, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 2.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [22476], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 57447, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 10456, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Thanks, this is great!\n\nHere it is:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/NoemiSalantiu/status/1156980624558895104\n\nI'm yet to listen to Peter's podcasted interview, soz @Johncoate!!

Particularly in a community like ours, there is also a great wealth of experience, much of which has already been distilled into wisdom. If we were able to access this wisdom, many would be helped along our ways.\n\nIt's a two-way process, of course. On some occasions we could greatly benefit from the experience and wisdom of others, and on other occasions they might benefit from ours.\n\nAnd it's more than two-way. One person's wisdom is often shallow, constrained by the very life experience from which the wisdom comes. If we are lucky -- for instance if that other person is a skilled therapist -- they may be very helpful. But in a peer-to-peer world, it seems better to rely on plurality. The more people whose wisdom we have access to, the more likely it is that one of them will be able to \"speak to our condition\".\n\nSo what's the essence of the issue here? To me, there seem to be social and cultural barriers preventing the full realisation of this passing on of the wisdom of experience. But also there are time constraints. Maybe one challenge could be to find ways of finding people who have more to offer us; or conversely, finding people who we are more likely to be able to help effectively.\n\nIt's a puzzle, and I would be delighted to read the reflections of others about this puzzle, or even suggestions from your experience, or collective wisdom, on how to address the issues.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-07-07 14:45:44", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:39.999650", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 302, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 6.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 40468, "user_id": 4246, "topic_id": 7837, "post_number": 42, "raw": "Ciao a tutti!

Costs are lower because multiple patients can be treated at the same time, in the same space (in the US, reclining garden chairs are commonly used to keep equipment costs even lower, as in the picture above). This is possible because this style of acupuncture mostly uses distal points on the arms and legs (no undressing required) and, after insertion and manipulation, the needles are left in to continue working for 20 minutes while the next patient is seen.\n\n[And if you are unfamiliar (or dubious) about what traditional acupuncture can treat, <a href=\"www.acupuncture.org.uk/research-fact-sheets\">here </a>are some research summaries from the British Acupuncture Council.]\n\nThis area of the UK has a lot of rural poverty. The town in question used to be a centre of the textiles industry and still has associated businesses, but now is mostly well-known for being poor, backward and depressed in comparison to nearby Exeter or Taunton. A walk down the high street reals the unholy trifecta of economic malaise, high levels of obesity, ill-health and disability, and that indefinable loss of spirit in a town that convinces every young person of passion or ambition to leave the area at the earliest opportunity.\n\nThe main message is that Community Multibed Acupuncture can be an incredibly powerful intervention in an area like this. The effect seems to come from a combination of:\n\n1) Effective health care - I've lost count of the number of patients who have come in with stories of months or years of expensive National Health Service treatments that made no difference to their conditions, who then see a large reduction in their symptoms after only one or two acupuncture treatments. (Moves to provide acupuncture on the NHS over the last decades have been faltering and half-hearted, and are now suffering from a pushback against anything considered 'alternative' or 'optional' - which is a shame, as it could save the NHS millions).\n\n2) Humane treatment - unlike the increasingly isolating and interventionist treatments common in industrial healthcare, the effectiveness of traditional acupuncture shows patients that good health can often be achieved through minimal intervention, through working with the body rather than against it, through self-help, and lifestyle and dietary changes. Demonstrating that a more humane approach to health is possible starts people thinking about what else they need to question.\n\n3) Collective treatment - something about the nature of receiving shared treatment with other people seems to have an effect on people. Perhaps it cuts through the common Western idea of illness as something private, secret and shameful - whatever it is, sharing one's vulnerability and the act of seeking support and help with other community members seems to have a profound psychological charge.\n\n4) Affordability - although health care is free ('at the point of use') in the UK, it is, in effect, rationed; waiting lists are getting longer again, and many NHS trusts are effectively bankrupt. C&amp;MACs offer a form of healthcare without the expensive pharmaceuticals, electronics and salaried consultants. Most either offer a reduced rate (e.g. \u00a320) or a sliding scale (e.g. \u00a310-30, where you pay what you want). [I've found problems with both models - resistance to the idea of a sliding scale is very common, and often leads users to undervalue what is being offered. Given that it has taken the District Council 2 months (at this time of counting) to respond to what should be a simple request for licensing, and given that the licence terms for this district are insanely onerous, I have found a degree of freedom and enjoyment in simply offering treatments for free and explaining to patients what sort of average donation is necessary to keep the clinic open.] If all kinds of healthcare were funded equally, acupuncture would prove massively more cost-effective than many 'mainstream' modalities - not to mention less energy-intensive and ecologically-damaging.\n\n5) Knock-on effects - people who come to the clinic see flyers and posters for other events while they are there. They buy a coffee in the cafe upstairs and bump into other people they know. They go into other shops seeing as they are in town already. People who had given up on the town are excited that something like this would happen there. Maybe some people even wonder whether there is something they could do to get things happening in the local area. These are effects that are common to any community venture, many of which other ERs have mentioned elsewhere. As with education, art, reskilling, etc, the fact that users of the service are making positive changes in their lives, and are already feeling the benefit of being involved, seems to snowball this effect even more strongly.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-04-25 15:12:08", "updated_at": "2018-05-24 13:56:46.157472", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 889, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 66.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 63245, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 11022, "post_number": 44, "raw": "Sorry for the late response, I messed up my Github notifications \u2026 and somehow expected updates only via this thread.\n\nThe good news is, with your patch to the `multisite_account.json` API code, error handling works fine now.\n\nAlso I moved the installation to the final place: https://bio26.edgeryders.eu/ .

I can think of just one right now: craigslist\n\nThose guys - Craig and Jim Buckmaster, two people I have known personally for more than 20 years - really did not care about the money nearly as much as providing the service to the people, and making a truly honest easy-to-use product that scaled seamlessly.  \n\n\"Do what you love and the money will follow\" was a phrase a lot of us used back in the day.  One can start up with that mindset, but can one continue?  In Craig's case, he kept the company private.  I think he and Jim own the whole thing.  They make almost a billion dollars a year.  They still give away most of the service.\n\nThey did not intend to be one of the icebergs that the ship of newspaper journalism would crash on.  But it was.  When I left the employ of the newspaper world in San Francisco in 2001, the company the previous year grossed 139 million dollars in classified advertising revenue.  Their building had a whole floor devoted to people taking phone orders for the ads.  Now - pretty much nothing except for some real estate ads and a partnership with Monster Jobs.  That alone torpedoed a giant chunk of the newsroom.  I think if Craig had not done it, someone else would have because the Internet is so perfectly suited for a classified marketplace.  But I am glad it was Craig, a decent and thoroughly honorable guy who donates massively to energizing journalism in today's environment that he helped create.\n\nBut he was no big capitalized company.  He was a talented but obscure programmer who very early saw a way to turn people on to good things (the \"list\" started as more of an events calendar for tech-savvy people plus sell stuff if you have it or want to) and it just grew from there.  He had the luck and insight to find and then hire an equally, if not more, talented guy who also had good business acumen, Jim Buckmaster.  Jim is a quiet guy who shuns the limelight.  But he is an extraordinary individual who at least used to be as unique in his personal habits as he was talented in tech and business.  He told me once he was so ascetic one year he lived in Ann Arbor Michigan (where it goes below zero most of the winter) that he not only had no heat in the house, he didn't even have a jacket.  Can you imagine?  that's crazy. Now a billion dollars a year crazy.\n\nBut I digress...my point here is, these guys in fact made a company that lives according to NGI principles.  And I know how they started and how they got to where they are.  Who else is going to follow their own path to a jackpot like that, staying honorable all the way? Or more to the point, what big capital is going to back something like that?  Or frankly anything that doesn't feed, and feed off of, this status quo system?\n\nSpying on people makes more money so we have to do it and either lie about it or see if a government catches us running afoul of their regulations.

WeMake works and happens by and in a WeKnow mind set.\n\nSo, the first conclusion is that at WeMake, people don't work offline, but in a different way to what we have seen so far on <a href=\"/en/opencare-research\">https://edgeryders.eu/en/opencare-research</a>\n\nAll this can might implemented in some ways to Ezio's matrix given that it happens the other way round :) ...from activities and collaborations (in Milan and online) to events (my posts), but further discussion is needed.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7677a07b00a1716bbfb86c36527e5fbab6895762.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\">\n\nLast, but not least, the approach consists in describing by different \"senses\" what happens at WeMake. I'm recording mp3 audiofiles (soundscapes, conversations, interviews), taking pictures and shooting videos, and -of course- taking notes.\n\nI'm also working on the side of self representation by WeMake people and on how what is social and what is technical co-emerge and objects, relations and identities are classified (this is a social problem, this a technical one..for instance). All this is terribly interesting and useful.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-04-30 09:12:10", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:42.754821", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 538, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [17566], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 57541, "user_id": 4861, "topic_id": 10458, "post_number": 3, "raw": "A couple of years ago, owncloud was forked.

As we start building it up, author [Malka Older](https://malkaolder.wordpress.com/) and economist [Raffaele Miniaci](https://sites.google.com/site/rafminiaci/) have agreed that they want to build up their respective talks by identifying  economic issue-science fiction work _pairs_. That is, we want to identify (a) relevant economic issues that (b) have been treated in a believable and novel way in some work of SF. The interaction will work like this: Malka will introduce the issues and describe how they are treated in the relevant SF pieces of work; Raffaele will bring an academic economist's take on the SF authors' take. Things like \"the Deneb IV economic policy program seems to draw on Herbert Simon's idea of bounded rationality...\" or \"the quasi-autonomous space habitats in the Kuiper Belt address the problem of breathable air production with a variation on Elinor Ostrom's theory of the commons\". \n\nHere are a few proposals for such pairs.\n\n**Innovation and intellectual property rights**. Why do people innovate? Standard economic theory suggests that intellectual property rights need to be in place to induce people to innovate. Schumpeter famously suggested that innovation increases long-run productivity by \"creative destruction\" of existing businesses. In SF, we have several interesting takes on this:\n\n* In Bruce Sterling's _Distraction_, a large company pays scientists _not_ to do research, as their results are sure to disrupt their business. \n* In Annalee Newitz's _Autonomous_, IPR enforcement is so tough as to have spawned its own (unaccountable, super-violent) global police. At the same time, there is a counter-cultural biohacking scene that innovates for intellectual pleasure, prestige, and pure idealism. Big bad pharma companies tolerate that scene, and recruit from it. [More about this](https://edgeryders.eu/t/second-reading-group-meeting-info-and-cheatsheet-on-autonomous-by-annalee-newitz/9051)\n* Cory Doctorow has written an entire book about this, _Makers_, complete with a viable (but highly unstable) business model for innovation under weak IPR protection/enforcement (and vicious lawsuits by incumbent corporations). [More about this](http://www.cottica.net/2010/08/30/leconomia-di-makers-di-cory-doctorowthe-economics-of-cory-doctorows-makers/)\n\nEcon references: too many to count, but a good starting point is Stiglitz 2007, _Economic foundations of intellectual property rights_ ([PDF](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fc35/a6693e4f658eacf35af1a2b3badb4ff4fd72.pdf)). Includes many examples and policy implications.\n\n**Reputation economies and gift economies**. In market economies, people coordinate through a price system. Prices emerge from a large number of market transactions. \n\n* Cory Doctorow's _Walkaway_ runs on a kind of gift economy. It explicitly criticizes the idea of reputation economies on efficiency grounds. [More on this](https://edgeryders.eu/t/the-economics-of-cory-doctorows-walkaway/8828/3?u=alberto)\n\n* Bruce Sterling's _Distraction_ features a population (nomadic \"proles\") who built an economy running on \"reputation servers\". Kudos are accrued, and can be spent calling in favors. i.e. mobilizing community resources. \n* Daniel Suarez's _Daemon_ imagines an economy built on \"darknet credits\", underwritten by a weak AI, the Daemon, that successfully infiltrated the world's economy and is taking a small cut from it. While execution is decentralized, the Daemon has its own agenda: a sustainable, fair economy. Initiatives that further the Daemon's agenda are rewarded. Now that I think of it, this is what a \"mission oriented economy\" could look like (borrowing on Mazzucato's work on mission oriented innovation)!\n\n* Ursula K. LeGuin's _The Dispossessed_ imagines a semi-planned economy where some central authority makes a decision on what needs doing, and breaks down these initiatives into tasks. People then take on tasks (they are more like jobs). Everyone is taken care of. A kind of light-handed socialism.\n\nNotice also that Doctorow, Sterling and Suarez all imagine dual economies: their systems live alongside ours. This is often portrayed as unstable. This is interesting in itself: does the economic system need to be one? Can we have several ones that coexist? Can people move from one to another?\n\nEcon refs: there's a ton of papers, some very well cited, but I don't know. enough to recommend anyone in particular. Can @Raffaele help? \n\n**Automation of labor**. Technical progress will replace human labor with machines. What are the economic consequences of this?\n\n* Many SF authors have been inspired by this idea!\n* One of the most radical rendering is that by Charlie Stross in _Accelerando_: machines trade with machines (they do so already, with algorithmic trading in any modern stock market). Since no human can be as effective at trading as machines, the economy evolves towards a system called \"Economics 2.0\", where the search for gain drives the economic system to gradually turn the whole mass in the solar system into a giant computational stratum (\"computronium\"). Humans and their habitats are not necessary to this economy. In fact, if _their_ mass could be cannibalized towards more computing power, some extra profit might be squeezed out of the system...\n* A similar, less radical \"competition between algorithms\" is at work in William Gibson's _The peripheral_.\n\n_Econ refs_: my personal project is to read Polanyi's _The great transformation_, but that might be a bit much to throw into Econ-Scifi's reading list. I am going to go out on a limb here, and instead point to [this post](https://marianamazzucato.com/blog/is-inequality-an-inevitable-result-of-technological-change/) on Mariana Mazzucato's blog. It contains references to resources (including fun ones like TED talks) arguing opposite sides of the debate (\"robots will take your job\" vs. \"no they won't\"). I also found parts of [this report](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324152837_Automation_digitisation_and_platforms_implications_for_work_and_employment) from Eurofound to be quite instructive. \n\nAny more ideas?", "created_at": "2018-11-02 16:59:24.642085", "updated_at": "2018-11-17 18:40:58.117623", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 973, "wiki": false, "reads": 23, "score": 344.6, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 4, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3067, 4703, 3904, 4496, 4196], "is_private": false}, {"id": 59620, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 10765, "post_number": 18, "raw": "[quote=\"nadia, post:17, topic:10765\"]\nthe simplicity\n[/quote]\n\n> **an open praxis for ecological research &amp; cultivation**\n\nThat's not simple.

The first one is to look at methods to carry out the analysis of what we are calling semantic social networks. By this we mean social networks where edges carry semantics. This is possible and indeed already prototyped in Edgeryders, because the conversation induces a social network (made visible by <a href=\"/sites/all/modules/contrib/edgesense/static/dashboard.html\">Edgesense</a>), and ethnographic software (<a href=\"/t/open-ethnographer/578\">Open Ethnographer</a>) allow to associate meaning to each edge. The result is pretty interesting, because your data end up inducing two deeply related networks: a person-to-person one and a ethnographic code-to-ethnographic code one, where two codes (or tags, or keywords) are connected if they co-occur in the same interaction. Interrogating these twin networks in empirical research is a near-absolute first.

One of the rationales for not being able to delete your posts is that in a world where data is distributed, is that it just isn't possible to guarantee that your posts don't live on. Today, anything embarrassing is impossible to get rid of from the internet if you are famous, but the only reason this is not true for all of us is that it's simply too expensive to save every piece of information I see online. But as storage grows cheaper, this will no longer be the case. Indeed, Worldbrain saves everything I read online in its local cache on my computer and makes that content searchable and available to me later regardless of whether you have deleted your posts or not. If it becomes as cheap for me to save every image I see forever, if it becomes as easy for people with camera-glasses to cache every moment of everything they see locally, can any data ever truly be deleted?

For that purpose, we're putting up a large dome in the middle of the square as seen in this video, which will not be permanent.\n\nFrihamnstorget is a meeting place for grassroots art, crafts, creativity, events, and culture. Stockholm deserves a meeting place which is built by and for artists and makers, but it's really lacking in that department. We're very inspired by [Institute for X](https://institutforx.dk/) in Aarhus, and we're lucky to have one of the guys from X join us for the build. \n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/6/674253c7b770c7ccf17665e7ccbd8b3840cedcef.mp4 \n\n![IMG_0341|690x517](upload://gCuNVLHyuykAaUs3zxeE9NqM1kQ.jpeg) \n\n![IMG_0345|690x517](upload://oFykCMGTSlY3CBYMrRxmxzx0L2I.jpeg) \n\n![IMG_0356|690x517](upload://8w1NRDJnZ3VzahrrC37Euu3GVBZ.jpeg) \n\nAll containers are old and worn, and many of them would have been scrapped if we hadn't bought them at a very low price. Our total budget for creating this public square, including a rudimentary caf\u00e9, a terrace garden and an art exhibition space is only around 10,000 EUR. For the first year, the rent is covered through a project with the port, and in the following years, we are planning to have the square pay for itself by renting out containers to artists and businesses that are aligned with the purpose, as well as events.\n\nOur garden at the top of the tower will be designed by @jakobskote who is also the main architect and project lead for Frihamnstorget. I hope it's the first of many green projects at Frihamnstorget, which I think has quite some solarpunk potential.\n\nOn top of the containers, we want to place sculptures as if you were in a modern 360-degree pantheon. Our first contributions are the Sputnik sculpture Linda Ljungdahl and two geometric metal sculptures by Olle Bjerk\u00e5s and Per Dahlgren, two artists at Blivande.\n\nI will post more pictures of the progress in the next few days, as well as from the event on Saturday, where Edgeryders will get a big poster and be part of two presentations.\n\nWhat would you create at Frihamnstorget?", "created_at": "2019-09-18 00:15:50.883741", "updated_at": "2019-09-18 01:21:48.816191", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 399, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 228.2, "like_count": 8, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [137, 4096, 3323, 4, 3, 1856, 2915, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 49447, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 9220, "post_number": 10, "raw": "[quote=\"hugi, post:9, topic:9220\"]I'm thinking to just set up a separate workspace.

Setting up the event in future**\n1. Identify a topic for the event based upon the ethnographic analysis done so far. Ask: what topics are the community most interested in? Which would be most useful/generative to do a deep dive into? \n2. Have at least a month to plan the call, invite a diverse range of participants (including the most active community members on platform on this topic),  and put informed consent procedures in place. \n3. Use the SSNA/codes/ethnography to pull out questions to ask participants during the call. (Research team can be present and ask questions as well as moderators). \n4. Record the call and transcribe the recording.\n5. Post the transcription and code the transcription. \n6. Generate an SSNA based upon it (we need to brainstorm ways to have the Social part of the SSNA visualised in this, but at worst it\u2019s a visualisation of the main themes of the conversation. At best, we separate each contribution into a different comment to see what concepts most frequently co-occur together).  \n\n**Section 2: Ethical consent funnel and procedures**\n\nCreate an information sheet to put on the event page that is very easy to locate and is in clear, human language. This should also be present before the Zoom link is reachable/above the Zoom link. This needs to be done at least a week before the event, but preferably as soon as possible. This information sheet needs to contain at a minimum the following:\n\n1. Description of Research Project (what the data will be used for).\n2. Description of Event - duration, type of event, what they can expect to encounter.\n3. That the event is being recorded.\n4. How the event data will be made public, processed, and stored, and for how long (include the possibility that the call will be transcribed and posted).\n5. That they have the right and ability to withdraw at any point (up until the publication of final research results, give date).\n6. Who they can contact if they want any of their contributions removed/want to withdraw.\n7. Potential risks and benefits of participation (in this section, we must list that we cannot guarantee them anonymity or data privacy, in part because we are using an insecure video client)\n8. What body is overseeing the research: if ERC/H2020, for example, then mention that an ethics committee with ethics advisors is overseeing the project, and give their contact information. \n9. That they also agree to abide by these rules in terms of data protection and circulation -- they are not permitted to make information public beyond what the research project allows in point 4. \n\nGet participants to digitally sign an informed consent form with the above information at some point before they enter the call. \n* My thoughts on best practice for this: create an online consent form through something like Qualtrics or Google Forms (not sure about the security of the latter, would have to look into it-- or generate own internal form if we use the ER platform to video call). When the user submits the form, they are given the link to the video call and can enter. That way you know no one in the call has not gone through the consent funnel. \n* Example of an info sheet/consent form currently being used: https://www.smarten.org.uk/covid-19-study.html\n* Noemi\u2019s \u201cMeeting Registration\u201d page would indeed work, but only if the I\u2019m not a robot box was changed to a \u201cI consent\u201d box. \n* At the beginning of the call, remind people that the call is being recorded and of the information on the information sheet (particularly on their ability to withdraw/opt-out).  \n* Inform all participants when the data is posted on the platform. Underneath/on the same post as the recording, give contact information for who to contact if they want to change their consent status and reiterate that they can do so.\n* Host the call on a secure platform so we can assure participants of a higher degree of data privacy/lower risk of data breach. \n\nWe also need to be clear about what the participants are allowed to use the data for. It was clear that there were a few journalists on the call looking for a scoop/for information to publish. We need to be clear that part of the agreement is that you as a participant can\u2019t go off and write using any kind of identifiable data. \n\n**Section 3: Content and demographics:** \n\nA. Content is shaped by WHO is participating: notes on participant demographics and its implications for content\n\n1. Networks and recruiting participants:\nThe virtual meeting consisted of 36 participants including experts within the legal, medical and public health, digital tech, privacy and human rights, public policy and media communities. Participants in the call were invited through existing social and professional networks, i.e. were largely existing contacts of the Edgeryders team, primarily Alberto (friends-of-friends approach). Thus, many were based in Italy, some in the UK, Sweden, Belgium and France. Expanding and diversifying our recruitment for future events will allow us to hear from a broader range of experts, researchers and practitioners. We should brainstorm ways to do this effectively, perhaps with @noemi and @nadia (and others experienced in outreach and engagement). \n\n2. Encouraging Participation:\nThat being said, a full demographic overview is limited by the small number of introductions given by the participants. We should think of ways to give speakers the opportunity to introduce themselves (if they would like to/are able to) \u2013 in a manner that is comfortable to them. The chat was one useful way of doing this, but it\u2019s not clear that chat introductions lead to more engagement between people of similar interests, since they came quickly and densely at the beginning. \n\nIn virtual events lately, @amelia has been doing a virtual version of the 15 minutes for coffee built in to schedules before conferences formally commence. One way of getting people more comfortable and chatting might be to schedule 15 minutes before the call as a \u201ccoffee and chat\u201d period, a soft entry. This happened point to a certain extent, and could be further encouraged by making it an actual thing on the schedule. \n\nThis kind of space for introductions (or thinking of other ways to do intros) may also encourage participants to become acquainted with one another before the discussion begins, and might foster more interaction across a larger number of participants during the call. Of the 36 participants, we find a small handful of experts on call participating more than once/speaking more than once. The conversation was largely driven by 4-5 main voices + mediated by community managers. \n\nThe same goes for the conversation in the thread following Alberto\u2019s report on the meeting. How do we maximize participation and encourage participants in calls to engage on the platform after the call? Also a topic we can brainstorm together. \n\n3. Making Discussions more Representative:\nThe following report is based on the exchange between a small number of speakers (in the discussion and chat), and though there are some salient themes, this may not be representative of the concerns/ideas of the broader community.\n\nTo that end, the participants (or at least those who were the most active) represented ca 3-4 European countries (incl. the UK). How do we include a broader range of people in these discussions? In terms of empirical examples, we mainly focussed our discussion on the UK and Italy, two of the hardest-hit countries currently affected by the virus. We need to bring in cases from countries with different experiences/ cases where it's \u2018going well\u2019: e.g. Germany, Finland, the Czech Republic etc.\n\nThis could be helped in our next call by pulling out questions we want to ask beforehand based on the ethnography done so far. We can set an agenda for the kinds of questions we want to ask -- pushing people beyond a few geographical cases, for example. This will also help moderation questions be more directed. \n\n**Salient Themes and Finding Common Ground**\n\nAs Alberto reported, core themes included the following (below). We focus here on themes which involved the most dynamic participant interaction (speakers referenced each other, voiced agreement/disagreement, mentioned repeatedly/stressed, asked directed questions to each other):\n \n1. Immunity certificates/passports are ineffective and risky, particularly as we do not know how immunity works in the context of this novel coronavirus.   \n2. Contact tracing via Apps and other technologies represent a trade-off approach in which civil liberties may be sacrificed in the interest of fighting the virus. The risks here are three-fold: \ni. Data and privacy: we don\u2019t have a clear privacy-friendly solution for the development of these technologies; it is also unclear where the data will be sourced from and how this will be regulated. \nii. Unequal distribution of risk:  there may be a disproportionate targeting of vulnerable communities,\niii. Absence of the counterfactual: these apps may be a way of letting governments lift lockdowns (presumably over economic concerns), however, the effectiveness of allowing \u2018normal life\u2019 to resume is \u2013 as yet \u2013 untested: we are developing strategies without counterfactual knowledge to work with\n \nUnderlying these concerns is the question of necessity: why are these kinds of decisions being made? Why is there a push to develop track and trace technologies, especially if we lack evidence to support their effectiveness? \n \nParticipants conclude that no, contact tracing is not the answer to fighting the  pandemic currently , but that they may allow us to prepare for the next pandemic or future waves of the current one.\n \n \n3. Coordination and Cooperation across governments and communities is more pressing than developing new technologies. However, the fear expressed by participants is that the pandemic has offered governments a pass to rapidly develop and implement surveillance technologies under the guise of public security and virus containment. It is agreed that we need to maximize access to participation in these efforts (e.g. through slow media approach, collaborative and constructive journalism platforms, information sharing, collaborating with researchers and experts and contact-sharing, as well as crowdsourcing existing data, tapping into open data sources. In this sense, focus should be placed on improving existing infrastructures, cooperating across governments and harnessing the potential of local communities.  \n \n \n**Meta Themes:**\n \n* **Feasibility** (in terms of resources, time management, coordination, monitoring): Do we have the capacity to process new evidence, the capacity to react quickly and to use the resources and legal systems available to develop policy?\n* Ensuring **Security** (on multiple levels): how do we avoid data being misused? How do we strike a balance between ensuring data privacy, anonymity and data security with containing the spread of the virus in a way that does not force a trade-off? How do we protect vulnerable communities? How does the rush to develop new technologies put medical professionals, their patients and communities at large at risk? \n* **Transparency**: Decisions we make about how to combat this pandemic need to be justifiable and their effectiveness and necessity need to be clearly definable. \n* **Access**: to information/reporting\n* **Uncertainty**: the absence of counterfactual examples/data makes it easy to speculate, but also makes any decisions we make riskier. \n* **Temporality**: Discussions in the call highlight an apparent clash of temporalities: what needs to be done in the HERE AND NOW to contain the spread of the virus? VS.. What can we do to (a) prevent future pandemics and (b) be better prepared for them? These two aspects need to be untangled as they are currently being conflated. Furthermore, how and what can we learn from past pandemics, and what can this tell us about how we ought to approach the current as well as future pandemics?\n\n\n**Section 4: Moderation** \n\nWe agree with Maria that we needed more moderators, at least one for voice and one for chat. We\u2019ve provided some suggestions above in terms of question preparation. Main summary here: ask directed questions when needed, but don\u2019t be afraid to let silence take over for 5 seconds. One of the things we are taught in ethnographic interviewing is that silence feels way longer to interviewers than interviewees. It allows people to collect their thoughts and think more deeply about the topic at hand. Changing the topic too quickly and artificially can lead you away from those deeper and connected insights. Make sure any directed questions build upon the topic currently being discussed. \n\nWe\u2019ll have to brainstorm a way to link up chat questions to voice questions so as not to move too abruptly. We can also discuss the possibility of letting the chat unfold as it unfolds, naturally, as people may be more comfortable talking in chat form than speaking. As a result, be really careful with the direct callouts to individuals -- it puts people who might not want to talk on the spot. Perhaps it would be best to only ask chat questions aloud if they are direct questions on the topic that is being discussed in voice -- clarification questions, follow-up questions, etc. One of the great benefits of digital calls is that those who would not be comfortable speaking up in an in-person event might feel comfortable sharing their views textually -- we have to be sure to leave room for this. In the same vein, \u2018lurking\u2019 isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. It may lead to people posting on-platform later, if we create the right channels. \n\nModeration preparation: \n1. The host(s) develop a set of questions to ask based on the ethnographic data analysis outlined in section 1.1 and solicits input into those questions from the edgeryder team as well as on platform. \n2. In the call, these questions provide a guideline for the conversation but need not strictly be adhered to if the conversation veers from the topics identified (the whole point of this exercise to make room for unexpected insights to surface).\n3. Consider moderation best-practices and netiquette, and communicate these to participants beforehand. See for instance this recent ACM resource.\n4. Establish moderation netiquette with participants:\n5. Mute when you are not speaking.\n6. State your name often, especially when the call is without video.\n7. Do not interrupt.\n8. Have a good system in place for queuing questions or comments (via chat or by \u201craise hand-function depending on the software).\n9. Repeat research purpose of the call often.\n10. Mention and enforce the Code of Conduct.\n\nModeration execution: \n* Most calls will need at least two moderators, one leading the VOIP conversation and one monitoring the chat. \n* The chat moderator is responsible for documentation and information, i.e. asking people to mute, repeat their names (preferably by private DM), ensuring questions in the chat are relayed and capturing the chat after the call finishes.\n* Both moderators are responsible for dynamically keeping the conversation going, this means coaxing the conversation forward and allowing for silence when needed.

Because the thing that differences this organization and others is that every member is at the same time care giver and care taker. What they want to create is a feeling of comprehension toward each other and toward the external world. With their discussions and events they create empowerment for the people inside the platform. At the Brussels workshop of OpenAndCare two of them where participating. This is their story:\n\n<strong>Claire: \u00a0</strong>\n\nLe projet R\u00e9seaux solidaires veut lutter contre les ruptures sociales, voire m\u00e9dicales et th\u00e9rapeutiques.

Une journ\u00e9e de rencontre sur ce th\u00e8me est pr\u00e9vue en d\u00e9cembre 2016, r\u00e9unissant des malades (en sant\u00e9 mentale ou pas), des allocataires sociaux, des sympathisants de la cause des exclus.

L\u2019axe formation, \u00e9coute, non-jugement sera tr\u00e8s important. Lutter contre les ruptures sociales. Volontariat autour de l\u2019aidant proche.\n\nWhat I want to do ?\n\nBuilding bridges. Mixing people together fragile or disabled people and learn\u00a0how to help each other. I struggle in many organization which I felt didn\u2019t had the good comprehension of social situations. Start things by a good understanding is the key for me. I NEED to create real interaction within social world. I come from a personal fragile life where I have an orphan sickness and I don\u2019t have any family anymore. When I was having health issues I wasn\u2019t taken serious by the hospital, and because I was alone it was difficult to find the energy to prove my sickness. I want a network where people like me can feel save but also feel useful to other people by telling their story and sharing their thoughts. Instead of finding healthy people to help unhealthy people, why not find people with likewise problems to help each other. It isn\u2019t easy at all, but it would be a step forward if such a network could exist.\n\nThese are the values where she wants to work around: solidarity, sharing &amp; transmission of knowledge &amp; resources. The basic for her is that we create a place where the people listen to each other, because there is for her the key.

There are different types of 3D printers according to the type of material, process and size of manufacturing. The additive manufacturing is one of the most commons; the material i've seen so far is a kind of plastic wire warmed and turned into layers added on a base on which in few hours any object can take shape. There are prototypes and test objects all over the scaffolds and tables. After a while you get used to such unusual presence and start to think of materializing by print whatever.

We talked also about the possibility to print food.\n\nWhen it comes to 3D printing everybody is open to discussion here.\n\nA meeting with Rune and other collaborators turned in a interesting discussion about including patients in the process of manufacturing hands, or prothesis to grab forks and spoons to make people who miss some fingers, the hand or an arm, autonomous with eating.

Been pushing a different narrative (data not just a commodity, the difficulties of safeguarding rights and public interest on a network that is private and optimises for profit). I'm talking to MEP's and policy people in the European Parliament (EP). You can find traces of that for instance in the vision document from the socialist and democrat group in the EP. The document is a difficult to read Christmas tree (dozens of MEPS and policy makers putting things in, sometimes contradictory), but it is a marked change compared to their previous strategy from 2018/19. \n\nBut the real work still lies ahead. On 6 May, the European Commission (EC) is likely to present a new work plan (given covid-19), so I can see if they still aim to come up with legislation on AI and platforms by end 2020, and what's happening with their data strategy. This will significantly influence my activities for the remainder of the year (which are a bit up in the air, given Covid-19). \n\nThe EC also published its [AI White Paper](https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/commission-white-paper-artificial-intelligence-feb2020_en.pdf) in February, and I saw @CorinneCS already pointing out how ambivalent it is (yes everyone needs 'AI' now!! vs. should be careful, lots of uncertainty and risks for peoples' rights, freedoms and safety...). Actually, the EC is now [consulting on that document](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12270-White-Paper-on-Artificial-Intelligence-a-European-Approach/public-consultation)), deadline 14 June. As a first step, it could be interesting to get people to respond to that, because normally mostly lobbyists and business do, which then gives the Commission cover to take a conservative/hands-off approach. \n\nFor the rest, now digesting Amartya Sen's 'The Idea of Justice' :)", "created_at": "2020-04-28 08:51:06.821267", "updated_at": "2020-05-14 21:00:05.790354", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 317, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 61.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [74807], "is_liked_by": [8, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 40478, "user_id": 4227, "topic_id": 7837, "post_number": 43, "raw": "You look very fashion over there on the table", "created_at": "2017-12-17 13:40:53.686857", "updated_at": "2017-12-17 13:40:53.686857", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 9, "wiki": false, "reads": 31, "score": 91.2, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4242, 2915, 4246], "is_private": false}]
