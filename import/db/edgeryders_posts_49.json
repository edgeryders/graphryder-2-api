[{"id": 828, "user_id": 3550, "topic_id": 795, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Asnada is an association born in 2010 inspired from the strong desire of investigating the role of the language in integration processes. Through our social and educational work, we try to answer a question: how can we live together taking care of our specific differences?\u00a0 Far from the identity concept, we make the most of our similarity, using the new language (Italian) as a common ground. We have opened a first school for refugees and asylum seekers and, some years later, a school for unaccompanied minors. We are now nine (eight women and a man) coming from different backgrounds (Journalism, Pedagogy, Classical Studies, Education, Psychology, Cultural mediation, Languages) and ages (from 25 to 55).\u00a0\n\nOur schools are the places where we try to build up familiar relationships and a sense of community, but also the place where we try to understand, together, the contradictions of the world we live in. The learning group has here an essential role because it\u2019s the context in which every single student find his place, support and the courage to express himself. The variety of writing and speaking levels we look for in the student group is meant to lead to a free and informal circulation of knowledge and language skills, creating a context where the directory of teaching is also transversal, not only vertical.\n\nThe language we teach is not only the language of the daily routine, but an intimate language which allows people to reshape and rename their past and present experience, together with their aspirations and future projects. In order to allow everybody to have the opportunity to express himself or herself, we don\u2019t only use the spoken and written language: theatre exercises, songs, handcraft workshops, games, silent books, pictures and images, silk-screen printing, short films are the means through which explore the new language and ourselves.\u00a0\n\nMontessori\u2019s instruments give an important support to the learning process, as they help reading and writing but also studying grammatical and syntactical structures. We both use original instruments (for example, sandpaper letters, movable alphabet, set analysis and grammar symbols) and readapted tools we calibrated on purpose for the whole group.\n\nDuring these years we\u2019ve been meeting more than six hundred people coming from all over the world. This exchange of unconscious knowledge constantly creating new ways of schooling and in these years made us organize specific projects based on students real needs or passions:\u00a0\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>The discover of the importance - especially for illiterate students - of learning at a slow rhythm, also thanks to practical activities, is the reason why, three years ago, we started to organize \u201cThe ground language\u201d (La lingua della terra), a class around the growing of a vegetable garden and the study of the organic agriculture principles.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>The comprehension of the role of the mother tongue in our life, as the skeleton of our soul, press us to find a way to support and promote all the mother tongues. So, we hold up a group of story-tellers named \u201cRoots and Branches\u201d (Radici e Rami) sharing traditional and fairy tales, poems and myths in the first languages and in Italian.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Due to the need to use as soon as possible the new language also in order to better understand the world where we are living, with its contradictions, injustices and opportunities, we started to explore the city not only as tourists but as researchers: recorder, camera and a set of questions are the equipment with which we walk through the city asking people we meet to share their ideas, their point of view and experience about an issue which is meaningful for all the group.</li>\n\n<li>The importance to look at the students as men and women having resources, abilities and strength enhance equal relationships.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nFrom 2016, Asnada collaborates with the groups Nuovo Armenia and Gina Films. The City of Milano has assigned to us a farmstead (Cascina) situated in the centre of Dergano, a neighbors in the north of the city, in order to build up a place where migration issues could be faced through a cultural production, developed with the foreign communities themselves.\u00a0\n\nOur goal is to reshape the collective perception of the migration issue with the direct experience of a possibile living together, in order to avoid the usual relationships based on charity or humanitarian help. The \u201cCascina\u201d will be the place where, besides our schools, will be held a multilingual cinema where foreign and Italian people will watch movies in original languages, but also a cafeteria (with controlled prices) and a coworking area. The collaboration of schools and cinema\u00a0wants\u00a0to start a process of thought consciousness by crossing these two situations: italians dealing with foreign languages, and foreign people dealing with Italian and other foreign languages.\n\nThe \u201cCascina\u201d will be also a place for permanent education in intercultural field, where we will set meeting, readings, conferences and workshops open to all citizen, with a particular regard to the foreign communities of the neighbors.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-03 17:14:19", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 04:59:14.867929", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 866, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 16.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13418, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5012, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Search engine workaround</b>\n\nIt's not just you, <a href=\"/u/inge\">@Inge</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"/u/noemi\">@Noemi</a>.

I have done my design education at the Eindhoven University of Technology, which was focussed on interaction design, service design and the design process. In my time as a designer I have tackled a plethora of different projects. All of them come out of the same vision that I have had since I finished my studies: to support people to be creative by giving them the tools to design their own surroundings. That can be products that have more value because the users puts their own creativity and soul into it, or teaching people to look at their environment in a more creative way.\u00a0\n\nI have designed a number of creative tools, both digital and physical. These tools provide the user with a playful way to engage their creativity and are linked to production processes like laser cutting, CNC milling and 3D printing so the ideas users have can be turned into tangible results. I have organized numerous workshops, for everyday creatives and education, where we applied these tools and taught people about the way design and the creative process can solve problems. I would like to share this with Matera.\n\nIf I will be accepted for the scholarship I will be using the skills I have acquired during my 8 years as a designer in the field to the problems and challenges the city of Matera and its inhabitants face. I look forward to engaging with the local community in an open and constructive way and communicating the local knowledge and issues to the Edgeryders community. I want to do this mostly visually, through illustrations, pictures, products so it is tangible for the outside world. My goal as a designer is first to get a clear overview of the problem space, organize and document and then work on solutions together with the Edgeryders and the local inhabitants. I want to facilitate a dialogue between everybody who participates in LOTE and the unMonastery and kick-start a number of initiatives in a concrete, hands-on way. So, less talking, and more action!\n\nI'm looking forward to hearing about your responses, and Kasper, I think we can work together quite well and contribute a range of skills with a Dutch flavour :).\n\n<a href=\"http://www.studioludens.com\">My website</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.thereallex.com\">My blog</a>\n\n", "created_at": "2013-10-05 11:23:24", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:58.772053", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 426, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24222, "user_id": 2422, "topic_id": 3954, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Thanks for the warm welcome and all the possible connections</b>\n\nYeah, the video was pretty well made, very uplifting and also very true :) Apollo-NG as a name is basically an homage to Apollo 13 (successful failure and same vehicle configuration/names). My name (chrono) is basically just the short form of chronoton and has no link to the gods at all. Only to time. \u00a0Pictures and Videos are in the <a href=\"https://apollo.open-resource.org/mission:tech\"><span>Hackerspacecraft</span></a>\u00a0section of the wiki. The Aquarius (HAB/Trailer) is still not available since I was actually aiming to get it financed all by myself to keep my independence and not to become a burden to someone else. However, the roadmap/technology/infrastructure is already here, a complete set of fabrication utils including a <a href=\"https://apollo.open-resource.org/mission:resources:picoprint\">decent 3D printer</a> as well (already printed wind turbine parts with it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=er4YR2oRwUc). The HAB already has a live open-data <a href=\"https://apollo.open-resource.org/flight-control/vfcc/#/dashboard/db/aquarius-hab-environment-indoor\">dashboard</a> (called VFCC - the Virtual Flight Control Center), basically everything including me is ready, except for the vehicle situation. As of know I've already invested more than 25k of my own money into it, just about everything that I didn't have to spend for rent and survival on a 3.50Euro food budget per day. But it's still not enough...\n\nHowever, it seems I won't have the time to wait much longer, since I've been basically evicted here and need to find another place. Or just get on the road for good, which I'd prefer anyways, since this has been my goal for the last 3 years. So I'd like to try to put out a crowdfunding campaign for the whole project and not just one of the subprojects (that can some once underway and time is more than available).\n\nUp till here, all people and Sponsors were only asked for non-monetary support, i.e. products and services, again, because I didn't want any contracts or other binding agreements that would force me to give up independence and freedom to do and say what I feel is right. I'm not willing to lie, fake or social-engineer to get something. I'm not a good networker, therefore I don't have much of a crowd to share directly. The Apollo-NG website however pulls over 100 people per day, looking for specific content/solutions the Apollo-NG project can already offer, from all over the world, to share indirectly.The DSpace presentation is quite big (lots of images) and was just a quick hack for a talk (not optimized). Sorry :)\n\nSo, if anyone here needs something or knowledge/experience the project as a whole or I as a person can offer, especially in terms of scalable (large and small) big/open-data, infrastructure, energy, extreme-low-power solutions, eletr(on)ics, film/foto, human-machine-interfacing, you're always welcome to holler. I'd like to see more people/projects striving for more independence looking for sustainable/sensible/resilient alternatives that could use some of the stuff produced here, so that my time researching/learning/developing/documenting/sharing hasn't been in vain. Spread ideas, hardcore inception into people's brains, because it's true, once an idea has been seeded it can't be removed anymore. And with our current speed of communication they don't take hundreds of years anymore to spread around and manifest themselves in one way or another.\n\nI need the edge, because to me the saying, necessity is the mother of all invention is very true. Only in such a constrained and minimalistic environment I can really shine and realize anything I put my mind to, because I'll have to :) And hopefully be a beacon of hope on the road to find some people I can inspire to think differently and give motivation/freedom to allow change. If only just some. I guess if I ever stop dreaming death will have caught up with :)\n\nAgain, thanks for the sweet welcome and the warm feeling of being connected to people who came to similar conclusions as I had to.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-11-27 19:47:31", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:14.318289", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 764, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4531, "user_id": 212, "topic_id": 4498, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Although I have been working behind the scenes with the Nepal Futures Makers team, attending meetings, advising, and working on strategy on how to engage people locally, I am now also spending quite a bit of time on creating a independent media center in Kathmandu.\n\nInitially, I did some relief work, going out to villages in the Kathmandu valley, helping to clear out rubble and build temporary structures.

Some of the project ideas, training, information from needed from experts, examples of good practices that were floated at the time were:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Explain how to identify PTSD- describe different ways that people respond to Trauma how to support them</li>\n\n<li>Psychological help for volunteers- how to take care of self\u2014working hard and long in the crisis.</li>\n\n<li>Awareness videos on human trafficking.</li>\n\n<li>How to prepare for monsoon season and best practices in building temporary structures.</li>\n\n<li>Education \u2013 facts about the earthquake (about on how to talk with children or elderly about earthquake what happened).</li>\n\n<li>Reasons for moving back into the house (many old people continue to insist on sleeping outside).</li>\n\n<li>Education on Public Health : toilets, hygiene and sanitation.</li>\n\n<li>Establish a system for helping to revitalize the tourist economy.</li>\n\n<li>How to help grassroots organizations raise funds and funding videos.</li>\n\n<li>Develop entrepreneurial skills and employment.</li>\n\n<li>Sustainable development/ permaculture\u2014how and why\u2014 land management\u2014teach benefits of organic farming.</li>\n\n<li>Team work how to work as a group.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nWe also discussed how to best reach the people in remote villages with this information:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Screenings in villages: mobile cinema -movie theatre in a backpack</li>\n\n<li>Short videos \u2013 that do not require much editing. 1 minute short video</li>\n\n<li>Graphic novels or zines\u2014way to get across information that is accessible without internet</li>\n\n<li>Audio on the radio\u2014local FM Radio Nepal-- BBC</li>\n\n<li>Slogans and posters\u2014need graphic designer and content</li>\n\n<li>Photo essays with transcripts from training videos.</li>\n\n<li>Sharing stories and experiences- story telling.</li>\n\n<li>Articles for local newspapers/ press conference \n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/2/2f6dc8c426802299e2b6fea25c62db8883232202.jpg\" width=\"281\" height=\"500\"><br>\n</li>\n\n<li>Disaster management- go to children they can teach their parents</li>\n\n<li>Use the international community- everyone has someone in their family that is abroad so can use that network\u2014 have more connection to internet and can share.</li>\n\n<li>\u00a0Posters with information in front of meeting areas</li>\n\n<li>Use facebook other social media</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nAt the end of this productive and ambitious meeting, in an off hand way, I mentioned how great it would be to have a space. One of the main organizers said \u201cOK\u201d To my surprise the next day I got a text from him letting me know that we had a space.\n\nSo we now have a media center and co-working space in the center of Kathmandu! There is a core group of about 8 of us who are here regularly but we have many people stopping by discussing their projects, getting media trainings or support for the work they are doing and just hanging out. Many of the project ideas discussed in the first meeting are now in production.\n\nWe have had many meetings big and small in the last week, and\u00a0 are working to set up a work flow, how to best connect projects to producers, magically finding equipment when needed, and struggling to keep track of all the ideas and contacts. The meetings are chaotic as so many people have great projects and many ideas. The atmosphere is optimistic and enthusiastic. There is a lot of talk about how media can help with rebuilding in a way that promotes sustainable development and collaborative engagement throughout Nepal. People who worked with self-initiated relief efforts now have a new sense of the possibilities for the country and understand the important role independent citizen-led media can have in the kind of political, economic and social transformation many are talking about.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-07 11:16:19", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:25.493452", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 915, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856, 2554], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18420, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 5217, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>+1 to Stockholm end of June</b>\n\nLike <a href=\"/u/melancon\">@melancon</a>, I would prefer end of June - early July.\u00a0\n\nSounds like we got ourselves two busy years.

What \"open\" is about, is that the separation between producers and consumers becomes blurred. In open source software, you help improving the software that you use instead of buying a commercial project.

Through trial and error in our own personal and professional lives, <strong>we have figured out how to do it in practice</strong>. Our next step is to secure permanently affordable spaces to support these new forms of communal living and working.\u00a0We are building a model to collectively purchase\u00a0real estate without going through the banks. <strong>OpenVillage is how we use our collective\u00a0intelligence to get a fast, cheap, prototype off the ground.</strong>\n\n<strong>On October date 2017, Edgeryders will open the doors of our first OpenVillage in Brussels.\u00a0</strong>This gathering offers a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for participants to meet, learn and shape the future\u00a0with peers doing inspiring work around the globe. The number of participants is limited to 70 founding members, the format curated to encourage discovery and deep conversation in an inspiring environment.\n\n<strong>What will happen during the event? </strong>One day of talks, one day of workshops, one day of building as well as an exhibition showcasing new technologies, tools and methodologies.\u00a0Similar to previous community events\u00a0we're organising the event around tracks which represent different perspectives and angles by which to understand and build upon the overall concept of OpenCare (community driven\u00a0care). This year we've invited a number of experts to help with curating three tracks (full program):\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Track 1: MEET THE OPENCARERS. </strong>Presenting findings from the OpenCare, a massive two year research project into community-driven health and social care. We will meet and learn from the leaders of promising projects in the existing OpenCare ecosystem such as [three examples here]. <strong>\u00a0</strong><em>Curated by </em>\u00a0</li>\n\n<li><strong>Track 2:</strong>\u00a0<strong>COMMUNITY PROPERTY.\u00a0</strong>How do we acquire and manage collective property for permanent affordable living and working? We will discover and learn from cases of existing financial, legal and governance models.\u00a0<em>Curated by </em>\u00a0\u00a0</li>\n\n<li><strong>*** THE FUTURE OF CARE: A POLICY AND INVESTMENT LAB.\u00a0</strong>How do we make it attractive to finance community ecosystems and what enabling infrastructures already exist that we can learn from? Implications for participants, investors and policy makers.\u00a0<em>Curated by </em>\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>What happens after the event?\u00a0</strong>The event is a launch pad for us to acquire and manage a permanent community property for permanently affordable living and working:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>A tolerant, safe space to nurture\u00a0p2p collaboration and trade across cultural, geographic and disciplinary borders.</li>\n\n<li>A permanently sustainable support system for individuals working to\u00a0tackle socioeconomic, ecological and political problems in their communities.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>A laboratory for gently exploring new ways of living and working together in diversity.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nIt will allow us to have in the same place permanent homes for a core group, temporary accommodations for others and shared spaces for working.\u00a0\n\n<strong>How do I get involved?\u00a0</strong>The number of tickets is limited to 70 per track. To secure\u00a0a ticket\u00a0you sign up as a member of the OpenVillage and follow a simple registration process. Priority is given to individuals who are and are willing to prepare in advance, as well as work with others to make the most out of our gathering.\n\n<strong>How to\u00a0support/partner with the initiative:</strong>\u00a0We have a quick informal chat to find a match between your interests and what is needed.

Governments must change their role altogether: move from a production role to co-creation co-production role (you called this 'facilitators').\n\nI bet there is no case of participatory budgeting in Canada... Actually, I recall an attempt of consultation of the citizens. It happened once in Quebec, but the citizens had to send their comments by email, and none of what they proposed was published on an open platform, for everyone to see and comment furthermore.\n\nThere is also the contest of youth being invited for a day at the government, which pleases me a lot (it's sooooooo fun to watch!!!), where young people are asked to play Minister of Finance and propose a budget. But that's more of an entertaining game, a rather twisted version of TV Reality, where the candidates are followed by cameras from all angles, every stratching of the head is recorded, every <span><span>sweats is tracked. They</span></span> youthful and naive citizen perform a show, in which they usually are unable to make as good a job as the Minister does... of course...

No amount of power is actually being lost in the process, as it is redistributed from the vertical to the horizontal. I would even be tempted to predict that a more balanced distribution of power gives rise to more a higher degree of production of empowerment, as individuals become empowered, and communities, and ultimately, the organizations or institutions benefit from it. In fact, everbody would win, with this type of distribution of power.\n\nAnd I agree with you, people would feel less frustrated. Hey, they could even feel HAPPY. Empowering people leads to creating happiness, as individuals are allowed to define their visions and grow by expressing themselves, learning from collaborative processes, gaining self-esteem, and feeling that they contribute to something greater than who they are.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-01 15:17:28", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:29.657676", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 440, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 15.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [26236], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22539, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 5138, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Selling tickets?</b>\n\nHm, not sure about that.

We dream of a welfare built and delivered by communities, alongside the state and the market. We all, at some point in our life, give and receive care. We are all citizen experts, with firsthand knowledge. The question is: how do we access that knowledge and turn it into action?\n\nWe asked Ezio Manzini, perhaps the world's most senior academic designer for social innovation, to mount a workshop that does just that. Everyone is welcome. People who attend will use their experience of care to imagine and prototype ways that existing services could be improved. We decided to focus on services to refugees and migrants: we know several and feel for them, and there is a lot \u00a0of room for improvement.\u00a0\n\nA beautiful thing happened: people got in touch with us offering to help. We ended up with a dream team of designers: <a href=\"/u/yara_al_adib\">@Yara_Al_Adib</a>, <a href=\"/u/mousab_alshikh\">@Mousab_Alshikh</a>, <a href=\"/u/rand_abu_fakher\">@Rand_Abu_Fakher</a>, <a href=\"/u/orwa_isaac\">@Orwa_Isaac</a>, <a href=\"/u/vishall_jankie\">@Vishall_Jankie</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"/u/stefanos_monastiridi\">@Stefanos_Monastiridis</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"/u/gido_van_den_ende\">@Gido_Van_Den_Ende</a>. Four of them are from Syria, arrived as refugees; three are still in the process of obtaining refugee status. A lot of work is going on behind the scenes; and\u00a0<a href=\"http://namahn.com/\">Namahn</a>, one of Belgium's leading design agencies, is strongly supporting the effort. We can promise a very, very good workshop.\u00a0\n\nEzio and the team are adamant: no reinventing the wheel. We want to start from <em>existing</em> services, and look for ways that smart communities could improve them. We are in contact with several people who are running services and initiatives targeted at helping these newcomers (thanks Yara!), but we could use a few more (we'll split into working groups). So, here's how you can help:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>If you are involved in a project targeted at migrants or refugees, consider joining us as a case study. We will be respectful and absolutely not imply that you are doing things wrong. It's about learning, not judging. Just get in touch with me, or anyone from the team.</li>\n\n<li>If you know one of these project, consider being its ambassador at the workshop. Talk to them, get information, so that you are in a position to represent it.</li>\n\n<li>You can also participate simply as yourself, with no particular project to represent. There are still some places left.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nThe workshop is free, but registration is required. Go <a href=\"/t/collaborative-inclusion-how-migrants-residents-collaboration-can-produce-social-values-a-reflexive-design-exercise/5163\">here</a> to register. There is also a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/179569975738885/\">Facebook page</a>.\u00a0\n\nI would love for <a href=\"/u/iriedawta\">@Iriedawta</a>\u00a0to tell us about the \"landing strip\" for Syrian refugees in Armenia. And for <a href=\"/u/medhin_paolos\">@Medhin_Paolos</a>\u00a0to explain to us how the (community-delivered) \u00a0network of solidarity for Eritreans in Italy works.

What I found at the opening conference in Strasbourg, was a diverse set of people looking for pragmatic solutions to very real problems found in the world - with a much longer term perspective than other groups, communities or initiatives that I had previously participated in. It was also rare to find a critical mass of people interested in values and practices such as decentralisation, open source and large scale collaboration.

Among our slogans were indeed Collapsenomics, State in a Box, unCivilization, The Age of Crisis.

Work on that concept continued in earnest if not somewhat erratically between myself, @nadia, @ola and @edwin in 2012. \u00a0</span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>Until later that same year when \\#LOTE2 happened, in Brussels, during the conference, a decision had been made that EdgeRyders would leave the Council of Europe and become autonomous. At that same conference, in the closing hours we formed a circle, and those who wished to make a pledge stepped into the circle and declared it. I stepped forward and said that I would lead the unMonastery project (the phrase I used to indicate modest facilitation, was \u201cpick up the shit\u201d), some pledged to projects that have since disappeared, others pledged to keep the lights of EdgeRyders on as it became it\u2019s own entity. </span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>Not long after this EdgeRyders, through a number of long conversations and deliberations decided to incorporate as a UK based corporation. You can read about this </span><a href=\"/t/edgeryders-as-social-enterprise-what-you-can-do-with-it/1044\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span>here</span></a><span> and </span><a href=\"/t/edgeryders-should-we-morph-into-a-social-enterprise/1033\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span>here</span></a><span>. </span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>In 2014 EdgeRyders played an instrumental role in supporting the development and opening of the first unMonastery in Matera. </span></span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>And up until this point all was well - but going forward past this point, about a year ago now, things started to slowly degrade in the EdgeRyders universe, this has been for myself (and I\u2019m sure for others) deeply upsetting and called into question many of those early visionary principles. </span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>Saving specific details (because they\u2019re not important right now), the characteristics of this decline in quality of experience can be recognised in: </span></span>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>Steady and significant decline in numbers of individuals posting on the platform.</span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>Noticeable degrees of distrust and paranoia between key people instrumental to building ER.</span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>Personal attacks on individuals through back channels and over email. </span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>Unfounded defamation of character. </span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>Burning of bridges.</span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>Increased concentration of power - diminishing openness to disagreement. </span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>Continual degradation of a shared vision and loss of long term perspective.</span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>Closed meetings and groups becoming common place in the culture.</span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>Unpleasant and high tension posts being the most active on the platform. </span></span>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<span><span>One such unpleasant exchange, was catalyzed by my suggestion to @Alberto and @Arthur in person (then subsequently in the closed Admin group) that we were in desperate need of a cathartic, mending of fences and a safe space in which anyone could express their views. I believed this was fundamental for bringing people back to EdgeRyders, making people feel safe on the platform and working together to fix the issues. Unfortunately this suggestion led to the </span><a href=\"/t/the-unmonastery-on-shared-ownership-in-open-collaboration/4192\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span>aforementioned exchange</span></a><span>, and has as such now rendered the suggested exercise untenable (I have outlined these reasons to Alberto in a personal email, but would prefer not to go into depth here, for fear of going off topic but I can if it is required). </span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>But, regardless of everything that has come to pass, I still consider myself an EdgeRyder and I would like to make the effort to try and fix, and work towards some of what I consider to be broken on a longer time scale. In order to do that, many things have to be said in the open that have previously remain undeclared, spoken in private or brushed under the rug..</span></span>\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span><span>Despite the machiavellian undertones of the previous post - there were some very important, and necessary questions being raised. Namely issues of openness and access, which unMonastery has sought </span><a href=\"https://medium.com/@unmonastery/ways-of-communicating-7fea2aa64d93\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span>to address</span></a><span>. </span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>As part of that process, I have been examining and </span><a href=\"/t/title-missing/2219\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span>reading back over documents</span></a><span> relating to the \u2018Company\u2019 and the kernel, essentially to try and understand where the misunderstandings lie. During which, it struck me that a lot has changed in the way EdgeRyders\u2019 expresses its function in it\u2019s documentation and the way the EdgeRyders LBG board acts in reality. </span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>And as a result of that, and in order to begin a mending process I have a few questions and observations to make, which I believe are worth discussing: </span></span>\n\n<ol style=\"margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>In almost all discussion, documentation and more precisely the </span><a href=\"/t/title-missing/2219\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span>Company Structure and Governance page</span></a><span>; EdgeRyders has been positioned as a sort of Github for social innovation, providing the platform, architecture and context in which projects can grow. At no point does it say that the legal entity (LBG) wields or would even seek to define how those projects will exist in the world - yet this seems to be a growing trend. Could we please clarify what the relationship between project, community member and ER LBG actually is? (Sidenote, most of the pages for the company and legals relating to ER have become impossible to find without googling, the </span><a href=\"/en/company/home\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span>company page</span></a><span> no longer features any of this information)</span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>Who gets to use the EdgeRyders trademarked logo and branding - and what is the process for this? </span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>Over 2 years, next to no effort has been made to expand the board, or open out the governance structure - I think this is a major contributor to discontent on the part of those who view LBG as wielding too much power. But conversely, this also contributes to a situation where people don\u2019t feel they have ownership or responsibility over EdgeRyders itself - creating unfair levels of work for those who have committed to the kernel. \u00a0(Whilst this week there has been a </span><a href=\"/t/stewarding-ourselves-2-non-executive-directors-wanted-for-edgeryders-lbg/4255\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span>call for replacement directors</span></a><span>, this cannot be seen as any kind of shift in governance structure, and with regard to non-exec oversight see point 9 below)</span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>In an environment under which all content is automatically licensed with Creative Commons Zero - how do community members (who may not be interested in seeing their work financialised) say what can and cannot be pitched to funders such as a Rockefeller? </span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>How are decisions about who has technical rights on the platform articulated - after having contributed code to ER and having admin rights from the outset of ER - I recently logged on to find mine had been revoked, without prior communication. Arbitrary decisions such as these add to a sense of unease about who makes decisions on ER and the openness of those decisions. </span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>Who defines the meaning of \u2018community\u2019 on EdgeRyders? (There has been a continuous shift between representing LBG and community. LBG directors consistently fail to represent the company viewpoint as unique and not necessarily the same as community)</span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>EdgeRyders has increasingly begun to feel more and more like an agency primarily focused on financial interest - the core drive seems to be focused on generating revenue - projects that don\u2019t appear fundable suffering at the expense of those that are. With things such as LOTE being seemingly discarded because they didn\u2019t generate the necessary sales environment. It is entirely fair for this to be the direction of ER LBG, but it must be clearly stated to the broader community. \u00a0</span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>What is the status of \u201cThe person who does the work calls the shots\u201d as the primary modus operandi under which ER functions - this seems to have been repeatedly contradicted in recent months - with calls for consensus (for which ER has no mechanism or culture by which to fulfil such requirements). </span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>In the company structure page it states: \u201cOpenness is our best safeguard against opportunistic or misguided behavior. People vote with their feet: if the kernel abuses the community, the community will evaporate, and the kernel will be left without a viable company. They definitely don\u2019t want that! But what happens if they don\u2019t notice something is wrong? Or if there is a major disagreement? If somebody else does something stupid that threatens your project as it unfolds? Our second safeguard is the board of directors. We are giving it statutory powers to overrun management and act as benevolent dictator when it perceives a threat.

The richness of the unMonastery project is dependent on the number of people who can be involved in the backstage elements of unMonastery, since it's the decisions made here that effect its overall trajectory.\n\nIf you would like to assume one of these roles or you have alternative ideas about these roles comment below!\n\n\u00a0\n\n<b>Roles: </b>\n\n<b>Facilitator of Fundraising and Futures</b>\n\nI imagine this role taking the lead in dreaming up and opening out the future of the unMonastery project. Throughout the time unMonastery has been in the public domain many individuals have suggested possible locations and opportunities, much of the time these possibilities cannot be pursued for lack of time and resources.\n\n<u>Some key features of the role:</u>\n\n-Raising money and resources for the overall project / individual aspects / individual roles.\n\n-Sourcing possible grants and applications\n\n-Writing fundrasing applications\n\n-Supporting and assisting the start-up of other unMonasteries or facilitating other groups approaching local governments.\n\n-Scoping potential partnerships.\n\n-Blue sky thinking around the possibilities of unMonastery on a 5-10 year trajectory\n\n<b>Facilitator of Communication and Community </b>\n\nunMonastery requires a lot of communication, particularly as we move closer to the launch, with the number of stakeholders growing rapidly: between designers, local municipality, MT2019, EdgeRyders and the distributed community contributing online.\n\nI envision this role as one partnered with my own, picking up on threads of communication and building momentum. Leading the social network engagement efforts and actively joining the dots on discussion at edgeryders.eu/unmonastery and the Matera community site.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<u>Some key features of the role:</u>\n\n-Ideally, someone taking this role would speak Italian.\n\n-Producing and maintaining a press pack\n\n-Facilitating press opportunities\n\n-Community management across EdgeRyders and the Matera community site\n\n-Updating, maintaining and translating content for the core website.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<b>Facilitator of Design and Dispersion </b>\n\nCo-design is inherently messy, it acts in a distributed way between many different perspectives, what has emerged in recent months is the need for a designer that understands how these things can be knitted together \u2013 in a way that reflects and leverages contributors intentions. You can see the need for such coordination beginning to play out in the first thread on co-designing the space (<a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/the-unmonastery-the-space-and-co-design-in-matera\">/t/unmonastery/315/the-unmonastery-the-space-and-co-design-in-matera</a>).\n\nI imagine this role would be focused more on design thinking, rather than hands on designing but would require and obviously benefit from an individual who can do both.\n\n<u>Some key features of the role:</u>\n\n-Establishing an online workspace for managing each element of the co-design process (physical space, ruleset and culture)\n\n-Designing workflows that can reiterate frequently\n\n-Supporting and collaborating on the Nominet bid for building unMonastery in-a-box (detailed in this blogpost: <a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/everything-you-need-to-know-an-update-on-unmonastery\">/t/unmonastery/315/everything-you-need-to-know-an-update-on-unmonastery</a> )\n\n-Co-ordinating and creating design elements: presentation layouts, templates, graphics and an overall identity pack\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<b>Design your own role</b>\n\nunMonastery isn't really about predefined roles, it adheres to the mantra of EdgeRyders; \u201cwhat we don't build ourselves does not get built\u201d and \"who does the work calls the shots\u201d. If there is a role you believe the unMonastery requires to move in the right direction, describe it, declare it your own in a blog post or on the comments thread and lets get building.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-07-28 16:55:08", "updated_at": "2018-06-03 04:44:42.019504", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 979, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [82], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21364, "user_id": 2694, "topic_id": 5009, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Just pinging</b>\n\n<a href=\"/u/anton_sabbe\">@Anton_Sabbe</a>, because I think this will be interesting for you. :)\n\n", "created_at": "2015-12-17 15:23:13", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:58.805764", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 21, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2201], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24651, "user_id": 221, "topic_id": 1129, "post_number": 6, "raw": "Hey Pedro,\u00a0\n\nthanks for the great papers.

So now in the upcoming month it's up to the community to prepare and deliver something that meets our expectations of how we want the future to be.\n\nOf course there's a value for each of us in sharing our experiences and talk with others confronting similar situations, or discovering that something we're intuited as good practice actually exists and can be replicated by US in our life or our community's life. Can't begin to tell you how much I've personally learned from Edgeryders around. For example, your contribution and your choice of staying with the family and giving up a fairly advantageous job offer will specifically stay with me :-)\n\nBut to make this Edgeryders learning experience valuable to others as well, and to transform it into smth workable as general strategy, \u00a0we need to come up with clear, structured solutions. The grand plan for the conference and the closure of Edgeryders as project funded by European institutions is to find the link from our thoughts and experiences here to a format understandable by people who can change something and are willing to listen and take note of this, a format that re-defines, in our terms, how transition in work, learning, democratic behavior is actually happening.\n\nThis is a bit vague I know, but in planning the conference we should all think about what we consider relevant content on Edgeryders and try to work with it: e.g. if formal education is full of holes and feels unsatisfactory for so many of us, what should change? we're talking specific, narrow policies, not the reform of education systems across Europe. Many Edgeryders feel online learning which is for free, fun, faster, needs centred could actually replace lessons in the classroom.. so what could we do so more people benefit from these advantages, but at the same time get a credit for learning in this environment...? it's premature to suggest it could replace classroom learning, but maybe think of it as complementary.\n\n\u00a0We already asked relevant questions in our campaign and mission designs, and we have very complex answers from the community, so it's up to us (with help from our researchers' team) to break it down into equally relevant points. Have you seen this preliminary report by <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/where-edgeryders-dare/mission_case/learning-%E2%80%9Cnew-kind-working-life%E2%80%9D\">Beck Collins - Learning for a new kind of working life</a>? Do you think it does a good job reflecting on our experiences? \u00a0IMO it helps structure the content on learning so far, so it makes it much easier to derive policy recommendations from that.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-14 12:13:57", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:11.050897", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 521, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1745, "user_id": 665, "topic_id": 1712, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<b id=\"internal-source-marker_0.10154085326939821\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; font-weight: normal; \"><span>This is the output of the Edgecamp session on Funding.

We don\u2019t like the bureaucratic processes, high organisational requirements and over-specified funding calls - and we are sure that you don\u2019t like administering them either. The financial and social crisis is making reform and agile innovation even more important, but processes are still slow.</span>\n\n<span>We\u2019d like to find a better way to get support and resources to innovators who can make change happen, a way that\u2019s less bureaucratic but weeds out bad ideas by letting them fail quickly and cheaply. </span>\n\n<span>We know it\u2019s a bit self-interested, because most of the people who signed this letter are innovators themselves - we\u2019re writing it at the Edgecamp/Edgeryders unconference in Strasbourg#. But we think it\u2019s in your interests too, because you have complex social goals you want to meet, but you aren\u2019t working in ways that create complex solutions.</span>\n\n<span>So, we want to have a proper conversation with you about resourcing innovation differently, but here are some ideas to start with:</span>\n\n<span>Resource networks, not people</span>\n\n<span>None of the social problems that we face can be solved by single solutions, so we should start to focus on building up networks of ideas and initiatives (old and new). The sorts of successful innovation network we should emulate include: [ideas welcome here].</span>\n\n<span>Look for ideas that have already got community support</span>\n\n<span>We think crowdfunding has potential to be expanded. Crowdfunding demonstrates that an idea has community support before it even starts. We could work on a matched crowdfunding platform for innovation. Like the Unlimited programme in the UK, innovators could propose an idea and get pledges of cash or in-kind support from the community that it\u2019s intended to benefit, and then those contributions could be matched or increased by your resources.</span>\n\n<span>Give people time to think, not money to spend</span>\n\n<span>Lots of innovators have to take temporary work to fund their lives while they develop their ideas, but finding temporary work is time-consuming. Rather than providing cash for spending, funders could support people\u2019s living expenses for a certain period of time - like a bursary or a sabbatical from a university. This is already happening with one project in Strasbourg [detail?], and is also the logic behind the successful Ashoka.org programmes on \u201csocial entrepreneurship\u201d.</span>\n\n<span>Tell us what you need, and support us as you see solutions evolve</span>\n\n<span>Challenge-driven funding models can encourage the creation of solutions that actually work. Small grants could be given to a number of applicants to enable them to develop advanced prototypes, and following waves of funding would only be available for the most promising ones. This kind of \u2018create-then-fund\u2019 mechanism makes money follow results, not the opposite, crowding away the \u2018experts in proposal-writing\u2019 and attracting the innovative \u2018doers\u2019.</span>\n\n<span>Support places where innovation and connection can happen</span>\n\n<span>We\u2019d like to see funding for a network of simple, cheap spaces where innovation can happen, and then we\u2019ll put regular meetups and events in them. We don\u2019t mean shiny well-staffed co-working spaces, just a simple space with good wifi that can be used for regular events. Kultwerk West in Hamburg is a good example of the space we mean, and Third Thursday in Brighton the sort of event. If there were a Kultwerk in every big city, we\u2019d know where to make connections into local innovators </span>\n\n<span>We\u2019re also working on some things that we can do for ourselves, such as:</span>\n\n<span>Moneyless funding</span>\n\n<span>We don\u2019t (always) want your money. We\u2019re looking for ways to match resources across different ideas and projects, and bring in-kind support from communities that benefit from our innovations. Examples of work in this area are: [examples welcome]</span>\n\n<span>Interoperability for innovation</span>\n\n<span>[Nadia, this was a point from you - could you expand?]</span>\n\n<span>Equity crowd funding</span>\n\n<span>[James, this was a point from you - could you expand? And is this properly in the \u201cwe can do it for ourselves\u201d section or should be in the top section?]</span>\n\n<span>We think you will want to have a conversation about resourcing differently as well.

A great project by <span>Jonas Rylander which we find very </span>inspiring for our design challenge you can read about in the following post.\n\n<strong>What are the expectations about the use of public spaces when it comes to cooking on the street?</strong>\n\nEven tough I already put up a short r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of our research phase <a href=\"/t/a-taste-of-home-or-the-use-of-public-spaces/650\">here</a>, now follows the detailed version to allow an even better understanding for everyone interested. Also we would like to share the other surprising insights we have gained so far. Maybe they are helpful to one or the other and maybe some of you would like to contribute. What are your thoughts on and what is your interpretation of all this? We would be very thankful for any comments!\n\nTo first introduce us: We are a group of 4 university students from Berlin, three product designers and one socio economic communication designer and call ourselves \u201cA Taste of Home\u201d. How we came up with the name and the following design question, I will tell below:\n\n<strong>\u201cHow can we help newcomers to use public spaces to their full extend because they do not know which activities are legal in these spaces and do not want to act against the law?\u201d</strong>\n\nTwo month ago we went into the field asking ourselves <strong>\u201cHow can food preparation contribute to make people on the move feel at home and include other people living in this \u201cforeign\u201d country?\u201d</strong> Amongst others we ended up talking to one 24 year-old guy from Syria and one girl from Korea about the same age. One had to flee home and the other moved for love.\n\nBoth of them are living in a caring environment. One in a shared flat with wonderful people (\u201clocals\u201d) who are all very closed to each other and the other together with her boyfriend who originally is from Germany. After having found out about this we dropped the second half of our starting question \u201c[\u2026] and include other people living in this \u201cforeign\u201d country?\u201d , because we did not see this need anymore. They are already sharing their everyday life with \u201clocals\u201d, therefore also cooking with them. At least in this context one could say, they are well integrated. This left us with <strong>\u201cHow can food preparation contribute to make people on the move feel at home?\u201d</strong>\n\nIn terms of food culture we found out that it is mostly about <strong>eating as an occasion</strong>. It\u2019s about the taste, but even more about the <strong>surrounding atmosphere</strong>. The Syrian guy once got invited to the home of a Syrian family also living in Berlin for dinner. The food was \u201cyummy\u201d and \u201cIt tasted, just like it does when my mom cooks.\u201d, but what he enjoyed even more were the conversations, the way things were handled around the table. The two little boys of the family were fighting over the remote control just like he and his siblings used to do back home. There was a lot of fooling around which not just he but everyone enjoyed.\n\nBoth the Syrian guy and the Korean girl are still cooking dishes they know from back home, even though it never tastes as good as it does when their moms cook. They both said that they left home to early to develop great cooking skills and learn all the tricks. In Korea traditionally a woman would only start cooking by herself after her marriage. Nowadays a lot of young people are leaving the country, respectively their parents\u2019 homes, not being married and therefore without the entire knowledge. But as said before, they are both still trying and sometimes calling their mothers to ask for help. The Korean girl once even tried to sign up for a traditional Korean cooking class to improve her skills but unfortunately it was immediately booked up. Since then she has been hoping for a new opportunity. <strong>It seems that missing the food one grew up with is a good motivation to become active.</strong> Good food triggers people to do something. It is important to put the emphasis on the word something, because both of the interviewees recognized that it is also the missing time, which keeps them from cooking all the recipes they used to love back home. Some just take too much time in preparation: \u201cMaybe 4 to 5 hours.\u201d, the Syrian guy told us. Having to divide their time between work, German classes, socialising and cooking most of the days they are not willing to spent these many hours on the latter.\n\nBefore going on and explaining how we reshaped our design question with this knowledge in mind, I would like to share one more surprising insight we gained through the two interviews.\n\nTalking about food and well being the Syrian guy told us that when he had just arrived to Germany, he did not like to eat outside. It disgusted him. <strong>Not being able to see the food preparation made him feel uncomfortable.</strong> We tried to find out the reason for this, whether it was because he eats Halal, which he does or it was out of cleanliness concerns, but yet could not manage to do so. We still have to ask again. What happened here shows one of the <strong>difficulties we had conducting the interviews</strong>. The question triggered some awkwardness. This we felt, but why we were not able to tell. Was it because the subject was sensitive to the respondent and his eating customs? Was it because he did want to offend us since we were talking about German food? How can we overcome such awkwardness whenever it occurs in future interviews?\n\nTo go on with the process of our research I would first like to recall the reshaped design question: \u201cHow can food preparation contribute to make people on the move feel at home?\u201d It still seemed like the question was to broad to be solved in one design project. This is why we changed the <strong>target group \u201cpeople on the move\u201d to \u201cyoung migrants\u201d (20-30 years of age)</strong>. We felt that the latter was more suitable for coming up with a specific design and the people we had interviewed both fit in this category. We then went back to synthesising the interviews once more and found that they were totally worth a second look. There was this whole topic of <strong>interactive food customs and traditions</strong> we yet had not paid enough attention to.\n\nReviewing our notes we got to understand, that for the people we had talked to \u201cfeeling at home\u201d in the context of food culture was a lot about the interactive customs and traditions which they had been surrounded by most of their lives. The Syrian guy misses the <strong>Syrian nights </strong>where as he tells everyone takes their coaches and pillows outside, drinks tea, smokes, chats and just sleeps on the streets. He told us, that this maybe does not happen in bigger towns but in villages as in smaller or medium-sized towns it does.\n\nThe girl told us that she is missing the <strong>Korean street food</strong> a lot. Once she tried out a Korean street food market here in Berlin, but did not like it. She went there with some friends. They wanted to have some good Korean food, chat and meet new people. It turned out to be a disappointment. It was too expensive \u2013 there was even an entrance fee \u2013 and the food was just not good. In Korea she always used to eat outside with her friends. Cooking was a family thing; eating out was for all other social events. Considering these stories it made sense to rephrase or specify our question to: <strong>\u201cHow can we enable young migrants to integrate interactive food customs / traditions they like and bring from their cultures of origin into Berlin\u2019s community life?\u201d</strong> Furthermore it was then that we came up with our group name \u201cA Taste of Home\u201d.\n\nIt finally was the comment of a fellow student, which led us to modify our topic to what it is about now. She told us about an interview her group conducted with three Syrian refugees. During their conversation the interviewees mentioned the <strong>huge summer barbecues</strong> they always would have had back in Syria: a lot of friends, family, a lot of food, somewhere in the nature, in a park. Having been asked if they are organising similar activities here in summertime, they denied. They thought that in Berlin it was forbidden to have a barbecue anywhere outside and did not want to act against the law seen their uncertain statuses. Still they miss them. It was this story which made us change the question to: <strong>\u201cHow can we help newcomers to use public spaces to their full extend because they do not know which activities are legal in these spaces and do not want to act against the law?\u201d</strong>\n\nThis question has to be considered on different levels. The higher-level question is: \u201c<strong>How to harmonize the expectations about how to use public spaces?\u201d</strong> What do \u201cnewcomers\u201d, what do \u201clocals\u201d, what does everyone using those places want and how can the once being mutually exclusive to each other being handled? The second level is the topic of <strong>cooking on the street</strong>. Where, how and in which contexts is cooking in public spaces wanted? And last but not least the design challenge is about getting to know the <strong>legal frame and making it graspable</strong> for everyone.\n\nAll this is related to the fact, that there are a lot of refugees staying in camps where they do not have any <strong>opportunity to cook </strong>at all or even if they receive \u201cfood money\u201d instead of catering, they only have access to a shared kitchen. Another guy from Syria we cooked with lives in such a place. He told us, that the huge number of people who are sharing the kitchen there is often keeping him away from cooking. Though some of his friends who are living in another camp without cooking facilities sometimes join him for cooking. <strong>How can we enable them to make cooking a regular part of their lives again?</strong>\n\n", "created_at": "2016-05-31 11:02:50", "updated_at": "2018-05-24 13:57:05.737237", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1804, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 20.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19259, "user_id": 99, "topic_id": 1482, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Hey Vinay,\n\nlet me explain.\n\nUp</b>\n\nHey Vinay,\n\nlet me explain.\n\nUp until the second world war, Italy was mostly a country of emigration.With italians migrating to various parts of the world (Argentina, Usa, Australia).\n\nOnly in the last few decades we became a country of immigration, with people from extra european countries coming to Italy.\n\n<em>The law in force now is \"legge 91 del 1992\".</em>\n\n<em>It enforces the Bloodline/right of blood, or jus sanguinis, meaning you obtain citizenship as a result of the nationality of one parent or of another, more distant ancestors.</em>\n\n<em>As opposed to Birthplace or jus soli,</em> <em>meaning the fact of being born in a territory should be enough to give you citizeship rights.</em>\n\nhttp://www.interno.it/mininterno/export/sites/default/it/sezioni/servizi/legislazione/cittadinanza/legislazione_30.htm\n\nSo the law as it is now is designed basicly to preserve the citizenship of those italians who migrated to other countries, so even generations later, their children could still be citizens, even if they were born and raised abroad and they never been in Italy.\n\nThat makes sense, and that's not the problem anyway.\n\nThe issue is, that now all those children of those extra-european immigrants, are left out of the equation.\n\nAnd as a result there are \"italians living with visa permits in Italy\".\n\nTo answer you better Vinay let me give you an example, mine.\n\nI was born in Milano Italy, from east african parents.\n\nSo since I was born on italian soil and my father was a foreigner but already a resident on a regular visa, when I turned 18 I had the chance to ask for my italian citizeship.\n\nI got lucky and I got it, but let me say, you only have a <em>window of time of one year</em> to ask for it.

All of your points are sound, though I disagree with the final one (will come to that in a minute).\n\nWe are facing two constraints here. The shape the session takes is very much a function of that.\n\n<strong>One</strong>: 2.5 hours means we have to choose a subset of a subset of a subset of an issue, or it will be unmanageable. Health care in\u00a0 a financial meltdown was suggested by Vinay as a means to (1) connect to the upcoming Greek elections (next week they could find it very hard to pay forn their national health service as the public sector runs into a liquidity stonewall) and (2) take advantage of Lucas's expertise. Now of course, with you and Simone, we have in the session two people who have hands.on experience of permaculture, and the session could be rearranged around food security (for example: how can a 20K inhabitants city in, say, Northern France achieve self-sufficiency in food production?). I am good with that, but then you have to take the lead!\n\n<strong>Two</strong>: the selling argument. The long discussion following Vinay's \"War\" post touched, among other things, onto the difficulty to sell resilience. \\#LOTE is after all a big governmental setting, so people will be looking at us with a lot of skepticism. We thought it would be a nice chance to hone our skills at pitching resilience as a sound, sensible policy issue. So, tactically we stay away from \"zombie apocalypse\" narrative and try to impress the audience with our pragmatism and technical smarts.\n\nNow to the point of contention:\n\nNo, this does not look much like business continuity planning to me. Reason: we are going to stay clear from linearity assumptions (see my <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/help-build-edgeryders-p2p-school-resilience/mission_case/health-system-resilience-proposal-resilienc#comment-3150\">Too linear </a>comment below). Once you do that, you refocus on needs (a very different thing from demand), and the business side of the equation melts away. If the exercise were just about how to float a downsized version of the same system you already have, then of course you would be right. But there is probably no way that's a defensible approach in a financial meltdown, so we get to be radical <em>and </em>realistic at the same time.\n\nMakes sense?\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-13 10:00:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:22.526398", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 431, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33082, "user_id": 2566, "topic_id": 4370, "post_number": 64, "raw": "<a href=\"/u/caraaoibh\">@CaraAoibh</a>\n\nWelcome to the team.

The summary is as follows:\n\nIn Egypt: Hegazy talked with the greek campus asked them to point him in the direction of interesting projects, is now conducting interviews with their protagonists and following up with extensive research. Results? Check out <a href=\"/t/draft-nafham-peer-to-peer-online-education-in-egypt/4561\">this case study</a> on Nafham, an online peer-to-peer learning platform in Egypt.\u00a0\n\nIn Armenia: Anna had reached out to a photo project done for women in outside of the Yerevan region, which apparently is rare. Here's <a href=\"/en/future-makers-case-studies-adventures/draft-4plus-documentary\">what they had to say</a>.\n\nIn Georgia: Inge explored the\u00a0<a href=\"/t/interview-transcript-mariam-natroshvili-detu-jintcharadze-urban-artists-in-georgia/4550\">work of urban artists\u00a0Mariam Natroshvili and Detu Jintcharadze</a>.\n\nIn Ukraine: Natalie has posted 3 interviews so far - <a href=\"/t/your-voice-project-from-ukraine-notes-from-the-interview-with-alexander-sanchenko/4553\">Your Voice</a>\u00a0initiative (to spread political will of young), <a href=\"/t/first-notes-from-8-interviews-so-far-theater-forum/4551\">Forum Theatre</a>\u00a0(performance tool to solve crisis/problems), <a href=\"/t/draft-our-park-project-from-slaviansk-uniting-project-for-the-post-war-torn-city/4552\">Your Park </a>\u00a0(united project for the war torn town to rebuild the community park and to create it as a free economic zone).\n\nSamar Ali: had 2 interviews with recycling social enterprises, that do workshops on recycling, and urban hacking. Also she is getting to better know the <a href=\"/t/topic/4547\">Khalia project</a>\u00a0[text in Arabic] and the <a href=\"/t/topic/4549\">Felucca hotel project</a>\u00a0[text in Arabic], both of them in Egypt.\n\nThere is a need to check urban hacking theme throughout countries, since it's a new trend\n\nWe also discussed the process by which one produces a great case study:\n\n1. Shine a light on someone's work (<a href=\"/t/draft-shine-a-light-on-a-futuremaker-contact-someone-running-an-interesting-project-and-interview-them/4534\">interview them</a>):\u00a0You need to ask yourself a question: why it matters, what's the reason to choose this for the case study. We are building a network of great people who can work together on new initiatives, so what can others learn from one another e.g unusual approach or methodology?\n\n2. \u00a0Make sure your record the actual conversation so you don't miss important points. We prefer raw documentation which includes what people say in their own words, rather than what we think they said/ our interpretation. Where this is not possible, take someone with you to take detailed notes-nit's very hard to listen and document at the same time otherwise.\n\nWe also discussed the criteria for selection of case studies to be featured in the <a href=\"/t/draft-new-book-on-networked-collaboration/4516\">digital handbook </a>we are producing, peer to peer. We agreed it would be preferable that featured projects and organisations should not be dependent on grants but have some kind of other revenue streams. \u00a0\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"200\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/211316862&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n\nDate: 2015-06-27 08:00:00 - 2015-06-27 08:00:00, Europe/Brussels Time.", "created_at": "2015-06-24 09:17:54", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:25.967513", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 801, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 15.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27377, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3885, "post_number": 13, "raw": "<b>Options are good</b>\n\nIf we have a good solution for the possibility to different sharing options for the codes, I would definitely go ahead and implement it.

Ecco l'intervista a Luca Rando, protagonista insieme all'associazione.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/ahxWtR130ZQ\n\nSempre a Potenza, \"Serpentone Reload\" ha ridato vita ad un intero quartiere e ha scatenato un circolo virtuoso che, se emulato, porterebbe ad una vera rivoluzione sociale, ecco l'intervista a Sara Bellarosa, sociologa.\n\n\u00a0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/bRAMCjxeX_4\n\nAnche nel Vulture ci sono realt\u00e0 che vogliono accompagnare le pubbliche amministrazioni nella gestione dei beni comuni ed ho intervistato Marialaura Garripoli, presidente di Futura, associazione di Venosa che si occupa di varie tematiche, in particolare di ambiente in questo specifico momento storico.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/C3QhkxUFKnA\n\nTornando a Matera, ecco il caso di Luca Tamburrino e dell'UniBas store Community information center, che ha unito in un unico luogo tre servizi fondamentali per i giovani e che nonostante sia aperto da pochissimo ha gi\u00e0 avuto impatto sulla comunit\u00e0 studentesca.\n\n\u00a0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/QgWg6w5iUTw\n\nAnche Emmanuele Curti, il professore innamorato della Basilicata (lucano acquisito, ormai) e si impegna moltissimo dal punto di vista dei beni archeologici. Ha avviato durante unMonastery un progetto dedicato alla mappatura delle memorie, ecco cosa mi ha detto.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/p5AIj-SJ_DE\n\nLa prima intervista, invece, l'ho fatta via hangout e la qualit\u00e0 delle immagini \u00e8 imbarazzante per bruttezza, ma i contenuti che Gennaro Cosentino espone sono davvero forti: nella valle del noce, insieme ad altre associazioni, si stanno organizzando per ridare alla comunit\u00e0 un edificio in disuso, ecco la sua intervista.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/A_AvNRDL5TE\n\nOvviamente non potevo intervistare tutte le realt\u00e0 che fanno progetti relativi alla custodia dei beni pubblici, ma con il blog che gestisco insieme ad altri ragazzi, <a href=\"http://osservatorelucano.it\">Osservatore Lucano</a>, continuer\u00f2 a cercarne ed a raccontare queste persone che sottraggono tempo a se stessi per dedicarsi al bene comune. E' di queste persone che abbiamo bisogno per innovare la societ\u00e0 e immaginare una rivoluzione civica che possa essere di impatto, l'esempio di Matera2019 deve trasmetterci questo.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-10-22 10:33:44", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:20.995041", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 647, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 10.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24539, "user_id": 3094, "topic_id": 5335, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Tajine</b>\n\nHi,\n\nIf it is still time, I should be able to help you with 3 tajines and 10 sharp knives and few chop boards.

Art College taught me the fundamentals of art, but it\u2019s the journey of life that provided me with inspiration.\u00a0 I feel my Paintings are very personal and reflects my own Timeline of life, In my process of painting I have found doors for me to explore and develop a greater inner spiritual connection to myself and our external\u00a0 Angels. \u00a0I Love to sense and discover connections in life and with wonderful people and enjoy where and how they go\u2026\u2026 My exhibition of original oil Paintings hangs in the two large reception rooms of Cregg Castle. I call it the \u201cGallery of Angels\u201d. It\u2019s a dream space to have my own semi-permanent solo show.\n\n\u00a0I fell in love early in life and built a little purple cottage in the countryside of Galway. \u00a0Lorraine and I got married and had two wonderful boys, Jaeden and Zach.\n\nMy twin Ivan, a sculptor now living in Whales, and I as young artists took on spaces for exhibitions because we didn't want to charge extra to clients as in commercial galleries. I was always interested in spaces, and ended up building my second home as well, with a purpose built Montessori school which I ran with my wife Lorraine. I took care of the project management and the arty play part. I feel some choose our school because there was a male influence and contribution, and feel it helped with some of the more distant relationships between some hard working fathers and their kids.\n\nWhile working on other creative projects, I also developed a therapeutic painting Workshop fusing my passion, with my training and skills in NLP (Neuro Linguistic Programming) and Timeline therapy. I call it \u201cButterfly Wings\u201d. It was suddenly the time to put it into action. \u00a0I had recently separated from my wife and was seeking many new positives changes in my Life. \u00a0I started searching for a healing place to host my therapeutic workshop.\n\nMy grandfather used to own Cregg Castle and then was passed to my Aunt, so I thought I would visit Cregg and see what the new owners were doing with it. When I got there the Castle was in disrepair and had been sadly boarded up for 4 years.\n\nI contacted the new owners to see where they stood and a few months later I sent them my strong proposal where I aimed to take on the castle as is, and start an artist\u2019s residence and a cultural music venue. Thankfully they accepted my proposal and we have a great Win Win arrangement in place. I had a lot of red tape and restrictions holding things back however I\u2019ve been pretty much living my dream here at the castle for 4 amazing years. It\u2019s a perfect space /place for artists to live and work together. It certainly is for me, I love it here, so much because it just feels like the right path for me and also I got to connect with so many creative, talented people here.\u00a0 When my Aunt had the Castle as B&amp;B with a strong\u00a0 traditional music energy here, Dusty Springfield, Sinead O Connor, Shane Mac Gowan from the Pogues, all stayed here on occasion, back in the day. Dusty wrote in the guest book, it was her special healing place.\n\nI\u2019ve had quite a few artists in residence over the years, come and go, and have hosted many music and cultural events, film and photo shoots, bush craft courses and other random stuff. I have now most parts of the castle as liveable again. Artists have helped me fix up spaces as and we needed them, each artist having a living/studio space and also use of the many large communal spaces. Last year I opened one room for Airbnb guests. I have many foreign visitors all year and they are all delighted to come and stay in a real Irish Castle. <a href=\"https://www.airbnb.ie/rooms/7479769?preview\">https://www.airbnb.ie/rooms/7479769?preview</a>\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/creggcastlefriends/?pnref=lhc\n\nMy Pony - Arrow, Donkey - Houdini and Cat - Pixie are a huge contribution to the positive healing energy here.\n\nRecently when An Ait Eile approached me about with the Monastery concept I was very interested. It was easy to see how it could map onto what my hopes and plans for the castle. So we held a PreMonastery event which was a great success. And since that I with Kashi from Cos\u00e1in, a local wellness group hosted an amazing \u201cButterfly Wings\u201d weekend. (Therapeutic Painting Workshop)\n\nOver the last year or so, I did a lot of work designing and fabricating two, 40ft high cube containers which I have created all on site at the Castle. My aim was firstly to create a purpose built mobile event venue and an alternative workshop space. The design includes a large indoor/outdoor space between them, with a mobile roof covering and a neat modular floor system.\u00a0\u00a0 More work is needed however to bring them to the standard required for holding events, and with the added potential as developing it further as a demo concept home. This project has me excited, motivated and inspired. I see it as a real positive alternative to the mainstream approach of building another traditional home.\u00a0 I took the opportunity to create a new start in life, moving towards a positive creative lifestyle.\u00a0 Freedom is my top Value and this approach has given me that sense of freedom to move.\u00a0\u00a0 Also it gives me the ability, to build my own home for a lot cheaper than traditional building. I feel we all need to simplify our lives, to our basic needs and have time to enjoy the - true simple pleasures and treasures in life.\n\nI rekoned, If I care for the Castle, the Castle will Care for Me and many more to come...\n\nAlan Murray\n\n", "created_at": "2017-02-28 00:36:26", "updated_at": "2017-10-06 15:26:30.763634", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1050, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 295.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13948, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3362, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>In the home page </b>\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/en/welcome-to-lote4\n\n", "created_at": "2014-10-29 09:38:44", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:18.845649", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 15, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2848, "user_id": 61, "topic_id": 2815, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<span><span>Key Project Successes </span></span>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>Bringing a disused building into use as active organ for human meetings</span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>Opening Event - created vibrant additional meeting ground for community activists/entrepreneurs and other curious citizens</span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>Public Transport Visualiser approaches functionality</span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>Generated much discussion</span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>National and international attention</span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>The beautiful idea has had a thorough workout with reality</span></span>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<span><span>Key Challenges to the Project</span><span> </span></span>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>The usual upstart problems - no hot water, heating, internet nor functional website</span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>Creating an installation of socially skilled but critical citizens; the </span><span>logistics of human resources absorbing the wisdom of poverty, chastity and humility requires a cultural intervention.</span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>Breaking the sound barrier - by mistake the idea of Italian classes was written up as an in-house project and thereby was ignored in favour of other pressing concerns. \u00a0It should have been considered inter-face and therefore more important than our website.</span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>Thrashing out a Culture of effective cooperation would always be a challenge, we had no mandate to import a \u2018solution\u2019.</span><span> </span><span>Six people in the start-up phase was a perfect group-size though it left us with a lack of Capacity. \u00a0Integrating new arrivals at various period of inconvenience required that we had either large amounts of luck or a profound initiating mechanism. </span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>Time - \u00a0The four-month model was always a compromise that demanded a miracle.

One of my projects, </span><a href=\"https://prezi.com/kseudk2x5ho_/cultural-stations-project/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span>Cultural Stations</span></a><span>, took place in London, at the Cultural Olympics, in 2012 (parallel to the Olympic Games) and another one, </span><a href=\"https://prezi.com/8o6xtteg7_yj/prezentare-scara-de-bloc/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span>Scara de bloc</span></a><span>, in Bucharest, integrating community, cultural heritage, art and design in the communist blocks of flats. I am, also, a proud member of the team who worked on the Bucharest Cultural and Creative strategy for 2015-2025.</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>Briefly, I consider myself as a non-artist in search of creativity and I am particularly interested in creativity for traditionally non creative persons. I use my blog</span><a href=\"http://traiestecreativ.ro/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span> </span><span>http://traiestecreativ.ro/</span></a><span> as a playground and a place to gather ideas and tools for myself and those who want to generate imaginative solutions.</span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>The most exciting things for me are:</span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>- connecting people from different areas of creative industries in types of projects they have not thought before</span>\n\n<span>- turning doubtful people into positive changers in their communities.</span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>It\u2019s a hard job, but I decided to take it one bit at a time. That is way I decided to initiate my own projects, get involved in those I love, blog and teach so I can work on different levels and mix their individual powers.</span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>Another difficult part of my work was getting the funds for projects I could not possible do exclusively on voluntary basis. Instead of writing project proposals and applying project management, I switched the way I work and I chose applying design thinking instead. It\u2019s a major shift in my work and I find it so much fruitful to be in the middle of people and generate from there the relevant projects they need and not the projects I thought they needed.</span>\n\n<span>Part of this shift, I plan to experiment my own workshop, called Creative infuser, focused on creative problem solving for people working with projects. I have to admit I was amused to see the coincidence in experimenting a Spot the Future workshop as part of the Edge Ryders\u2019 connector role in Bucharest.</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>If I were handed the community connector role:</span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>- I would start mapping cultural disruptors such as </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/anghelf\"

The stories we\u2019ve shared and our interactions - social, peer-to-peer and rewarding learning experiences as they feel - are part of an overriding research goal: to enable us to better inform policy initiatives around youth transition. We\u2019d like to try to make sense of it all, as a community and with the help of a small research team; the team has been reading, analysing and placing Edgeryders material in contexts that the policy world, including institutions, can make sense of - i.e in the form of policy research papers, each addressing a specific theme. The idea is to use the papers as a starting point for an open and collaborative writing process, because as a community we can produce something much better than anything 10 experts in a room can put together. After the validation process is done, <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/users/beckery\">Rebecca Collins</a> will then synthesize the main points from the papers, and the community discussions around them into a first version of the transition handbook. The handbook aims to leverage Edgeryders\u2019 collective wisdom to the point where it makes an impact in the policy community, by speaking to individuals in institutions charged with addressing specific issues. The document should also speak directly to young people and other Edgeryders, using key terminology as used by Edgeryders themselves. <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IBrUGChnuhXamzCWF5OqndAgurog3D1x2pfhPxW2hF0/edit\">For a detailed overview of background, process and your role in building the handbook, as well as tentative structure and production timeline go to this doc. </a> <strong>Want to help Make sense of Edgeryders experiences?</strong> Start by checking out the summary of Rebecca's and Valentina's ethnographic report:\n\n<em>Both real and virtual networks constitute a fundamental structure of support for Edgeryders: they provide an arsenal of inspiration, motivation, skills, guidance and mentoring, emotional support, and they are channels where individual projects can take off, through understanding of reciprocity, and the reputational mechanism. For some Edgeryders, peer networks are taking on characteristics associated with families. The latter are indeed the cornerstone of support, emotionally, but also financially.\u00a0 The policy-relevant implication here is: who else should be bearing some of the risks \u2013 and enjoying some of the rewards \u2013 of Edgeryders initiatives? </em><a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/making-sense-edgeryders-experiences-where-do-we-go-here/mission_case/edgeryders-transition-getting-b\">read more</a>\n\nDo you recognize yourself in the description?

I suggest one that focuses (1) on Nepal; (2) on how people can be involved and only then (3)\u00a0on Edgeryders. What you have now is something that gets to the meat halfway down the post; and it treats Nepal as just another country.\u00a0\n\nI suggest something like this:\n\n\"Edgeryders is going to Nepal. Natalia and I will be in Kathmandu by the end of this month: we are being asked by UNDP to help make the country's nation building process more inclusive. This is, to say the least, exciting.\"\u00a0\n\n\"If you are fascinated by transition and change, Nepal is a really interesting country, one that was never afraid to experiment with uncommon models. In 1951 it had a revolution, that managed to instate a constitutional democracy. In 1960 it saw a \"royal coup\": the king declared parliamentary democracy a failure, and dreamed up a \"partyless\" system of local governing councils. In 1996 a Maoist insurgency started to establish \"people's government\" at a district level, as the civil war between insurgents and loyalists burned on. In 2001 Prince Dipendra \"went on a shooting-spree\", assassinating nine members of the royal family, including the ruling King and his Queen, before shooting himself. In 2002 the new King deposed the government and took complete personal control of the state, but he reverted back to having a government after one week. In 2005 he did that again \u2013 and for good measure cut phone and Internet access [...]\" (the history of Nepal is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Nepal\">here</a>) \"[...] the country is engaged in the difficult, but exciting, task of rebuilding itself into a model that works for everyone.\"\n\n\"UNDP is trying to help make this process of nation building more inclusive. We are being called in to include, specifically, what they call \"alternative leaders\"; these would be hackers, activists, social innovators. Imagine what would have happened if Mandela could have enlisted the Chaos Computer Club in 1994, bringing openness and computers to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission! [...]\"\n\n\"Of course, this sounds like Mission Impossible. Political change is very difficult. Political \u00e9lites in any country are often unenthusiastic about opening up to new people with different cultures, and we have no reason to believe Nepal will be different. But guess what: we are always moaning and complaining about how things don't work. Well, here is a small chance to make a small difference to a historically important process. We are going to run for it, and we are going to make the absolute most of it, for ourselves as well as for our Nepalese brothers and sisters. After all, Mission Impossible is exactly what we are building Edgeryders for: we want to be the f<a href=\"/t/the-business-corporation-as-a-symbiont-to-a-community-edgeryders-crosses-a-watershed/4131\">oreign legion of social innovation</a>, remember?\"\n\n\"So Natalia and I are moving to Kathmandu for a while.

People seem to have three different kinds of stories about why they're here: Return to a previous or authentic awareness; Epiphanic awakening; or a kind of stuttering, growing sense that something has to change. The story I usually tell is a mix of the first and the third. I've not had any epiphanies or breakdowns worth telling about, but I do have them every day. Litte epiphanies due to disturbing or affirmatory insights on reading news or seeing signs of oddness or beauty. Mini-breakdowns every night when I despair about the future for my child and her children and everyone else's. Also, where I am now is a return to how I was raised. I grew up in what was described as 'the greenest family in Norfolk' (Norfolk, England, that is), and this was a combination of sustainable rural frugality and early awareness of environmental degradation (e.g. Silent Spring). But the arts in general and art history in particular were what I loved and knew about, so that's what I did, combined with education. My first proper job was a good one, at the Tate as Education Officer and later I became Head of Learning at the British Library. The Library was extraordinary but I was a manager and the other management were increasingly from financial corporate backgrounds and we could have been speaking Martian to each other. So, I left to set up my own company in 2006, Flow, with Mark Stevenson (author of An Optimist's Tour of the Future and founder of the League of Pragmatic Optimists). The idea was that this would be a platform for us to develop our own vision, on a foundation of good ethical business. I specialise in consulting arts and heritage organisations, especially on learning and digital strategies. I've done some work too in the sector on environmental sustainability and ecological literacy but my bread and butter comes from helping open up collections and content for public engagement with digital tools. In recent months, I've been feeling a stronger need to be an activist, a writer and an artist, all those three things together. I still have to eat, so I hope the consultancy work will still be strong, but my creative enquiry into the Learning Planet is becoming more important. I'm involved in a lot of networks, almost too many to mention, including Wikiquals (doing PhD level research and a book in a collaborative group of scholars), Dark Mountain, Re:think, the Happy Museum, a local group called Bold Vision (which includes Transition work, a cafe, cultural programme and running a people's library), and more. I think I'm in too many networks so I'm slightly wary of getting very into Edgeryders too, but I'm intrigued to know how this might enhance all of that and make communication easier and help action arise from it.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Around this, there is doing photography (about ecology, learning, place and childhood) and being a home-schooler of my 11 year old daughter Megan. The more I can integrate these two things into my professional life, the better. Pretty much everything I think about what matters gets out onto Twitter @bridgetmck and onto my blog thelearningplanet.wordpress.com \u00a0I love to receive critical commentary on my articles.\n\nMy research into the Learning Planet is about how communities can learn faster, learn together and learn with an ecological turn. I want to put this thinking into theory (or rather non-theoretical storytelling) in a book, and also into practice through a co-learning platform (aimed at informal and home-based learners). So, you can see I'm interested in Edgeryders, both as a case study for this book and an exemplification of such a learning platform.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-12 19:44:16", "updated_at": "2017-09-21 11:45:47.695324", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 648, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 6.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26500, "user_id": 1504, "topic_id": 4075, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Exactly.</b>\n\nEither explicit structure or tyranny of the in-the-know.\n\nI think I tried to communicate this at Lote3, sorry if I wasn't clearer.\n\nBut then perhaps each movement needs to re-discover this on it's own?!\n\nV/.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-02-03 16:21:09", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:26.861933", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 51, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16566, "user_id": 2, "topic_id": 3410, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Not an issue</b>\n\nThe tickets have 'notional value' only, \u00a0are not negotiable and cannot be traded ....\n\nso there are no tax issues ...since they do not count as income...in the same way as your supermarket loyalty points are not income....\n\n", "created_at": "2014-10-02 09:09:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:32.744053", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 48, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32762, "user_id": 1935, "topic_id": 5227, "post_number": 42, "raw": "am having problem with installing tulip on ubuntu...am still new with ubuntu so might need some help. will try again in the morning though\n\n", "created_at": "2016-02-25 02:47:05", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:59.865129", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 27, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [32719], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24542, "user_id": 2274, "topic_id": 3544, "post_number": 16, "raw": "<b>Arrival</b>\n\nI will arrive on the 19th as well.

Magazine as the \"<a href=\"http://johncoate.com/WiredCover05-97.jpg\">world's most influential online community</a>.\"\u00a0 Though the title was \"Marketing Director and Conference Manager,\" in fact, from 1986 through 1991, I was the first Online Community Manager, meaning my main job was the care and growth of the social aspects of the network.\n\nThen:\n\n1994 I co-founded the first major news website, <a href=\"http://sfgate.com\">SF Gate</a>, which I managed until 2001. (It's now a shadow of its former self, btw.)\n\n2002-3 I was the Development Director for the <a href=\"http://eff.org\">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>.\n\n2004-5 I helped start the US version of \"<a href=\"https://www.habbo.com/\">Habbo Hotel</a>\" a graphical online game environment where I essentially spent two years as a cartoon character named \"<a href=\"http://habbo.wikia.com/wiki/Brojo\">Brojo</a>\" talking to teenagers.\n\n2006-7 I was director of editorial and website operations at <a href=\"http://techsoupl.org\">techsoup.org</a>, a nonprofit that helps other nonprofits acquire software and tools.\n\nThen I moved up to the rural north coast area of California where, from 2008 until this past July, I became the General Manager/Executive Director of <a href=\"http://kzyx.org\">KZYX-FM</a>, a public radio station that serves a huge rural geographic area.\n\nAnd now I'm back in the SF area and working my way into ER in whatever way works best.\n\nI met Alberto in 2013 when we both presented at a virtual communities conference, <a href=\"http://www.leadernetworks.com/2013/03/john-coates-and-well-looking-ahead-by.html\">Vircomm 2013</a>.\n\nAlso that year I gave a talk called \"<a href=\"http://johncoate.com/Origins%20of%20Online%20Community%20Sydney%202013.mov\">Origins of Online Community</a>\" (link goes to a .mov of it) in Sydney AU at the SWARM online community management conference.\n\nI wrote one of the first, if not the first, treatises about online community management back in 1991, called <a href=\"http://johncoate.com/innkeeping.html\">Cyberspace Innkeeping: Building Online Community</a>, which is dated in its orientation to the specific technologies, but will never go out of date regarding social dynamics...unless human nature itself changes.\u00a0 Still, I'm working on a shorter, more up-to-date version of this.\u00a0 Meanwhile, this short list of <a href=\"http://johncoate.com/principles.html\">Principles</a> gives you a basic sense of my approach.\n\nOk, I'll stop there, except to say that I am married, have kids and grandkids, play the guitar half-decently on a good night, love to hike, bike, kayak, row, sail and travel and have an advanced SCUBA certificate.\u00a0 And I love to hang out with my friends, which will include <em>you</em> soon enough.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-10-14 23:36:43", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:27.914214", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 876, "wiki": false, "reads": 21, "score": 84.2, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2201, 4, 1935, 2551, 2330], "is_private": false}, {"id": 15590, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1842, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Test comment please ignore</b>\n\nTesting\n\n", "created_at": "2013-08-06 20:12:52", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:27.692599", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 9, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27036, "user_id": 60, "topic_id": 1323, "post_number": 15, "raw": "<b>In the Uk too!</b>\n\nHi Marukomu, in the UK there is Hide&amp;Seek (http://www.hideandseek.net/).\n\nThey organize street game festival in London and other Uk cities!\n\n", "created_at": "2012-03-05 09:53:21", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:29.558386", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 35, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4596, "user_id": 2546, "topic_id": 4563, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7fe43a3af0ee4631419443cd1842688ab2a79391.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\"><br>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<em>The opportunities can then soar. It is Thursday and I get in touch with Kamal Bhatta. He is a filmmaker, actor and an activist and most recently, he has been actively involved in the project \\#Act4quake. Through funds that was about 14000K, the initiative managed to reach the depths of Earthquake stricken region, all thanks to volunteers who worked hard. This is a great example of citizen driven earthquake relief that scaled up considerably. Their work is interesting but it is best if Kamal shares his story himself. So here it is.</em>\n\n<strong>Since the beginning</strong>\n\n\u201cWe are working as a team <a href=\"http://act4quake.org/\">#Act4quake</a> a joint effort of <a href=\"http://www.ayon.org\">AYON</a> (Association of Youth organization Nepal) and CYSU (Come on Youth Stand Up). AYON is an umbrella organization for Nepali youth NGOs and CYSU is a volunteer organization working for the natural disaster hit area for 6-7 years. After the May 12th Earthquake, I joined them as Individual volunteer and was included in the Core Team since 27th of April. This \\#Act4quake team was set up after 23 hours of earthquake but I joined them later. We first set up help desk near the office of AYON from Day 3 to call volunteers and seek donation. Next we started receiving volunteer calls and helping hands, so we started our relief distribution from fourth day of earthquake.\n\nUntil now, we have finished 30 days of work, we have mobilized 1000+ Volunteers to the affected areas, 200+ Volunteer teams deployed, we had 550+ volunteers with special skills, 30+ back end staff and support to make distribution easy. We have reached 270+ communities and covered 17 districts. We have also supplied 270+ loads of truck filled with 53000+ kilograms of dry food and 18,921 kg of other food items along with 677+ pieces of other medical items. We also delivered 9500+ tents and tarps and 900+ of bedding (blankets,towels, mosquito nets, mattress). We received 400+ individual and institutional donors (donation in the form of money, clothes, food, medicines) and we received NRs. 14000K Cash from individuals and institutions.\u201d\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e3775acda5c10c24df669eb119b99ca04d6b5ec3.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\"><br>\n\n<strong>Organizational focus</strong>\n\n\u201cWe focused our relief work only based on food and temporary shelters as there was an overwhelming demand for it from the hard hit zones. Although for the first few days we mobilized some volunteers for Sanitation work, and there were other volunteers organization working in cleaning up rubble in heritage sites and sanitation, we decided to focus on food and temporary shelter. We worked in remote areas of Sindhupalchok, Dolkha, Kavre, Gorkha, Rasuwa, Dhading, Nuwakot, Gorkha, Lamjung, Ramechhap, Solukhumbu. Our volunteers carried carried sacks of rice on their own and walked for 3-4 days to reach the affected remote areas.\n\nAt the start of our relief distribution program, I was helping the team as back end staff because I was not fully fit to travel. After a week of operation, I had a chance to travel to Sindhupalchok a district hard hit by earthquake. While travelling I saw the impact of earthquake was enormous, almost 95% of houses were turned into rubble, there was despair in the faces of people, people were waiting for helping hands and also government support for clearance of the destroyed house in the city. As I moved to the rural areas, I found people in desperate need of food and shelter but they were resilient enough to build makeshift shelter, cremate the deceased people and manage the task of decomposing the domestic animals killed by Earthquake, which was a great step to curb the feared epidemic very probable after the earthquake. Experiencing all these, I learned that our society was divided into two groups - \u00a0major portion was resilient and there also were more dependent ones. What I also felt was that there are evil trends like caste based discrimination on the relief distribution operation. Marginalized people were left out or given less relief materials as compared to the people who had access to the government agencies, because of their higher dominance in the society. I also got a chance to test myself in this crisis. Although I was afraid of aftershocks and my family was very protective of me, I went out and reached those who needed me.\u201d\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/73c12cca000c345ea18a760cae2f91287f121f39.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\"><br>\n\n<strong>Heartbreaking and eye-opening experiences</strong>\n\n\u201cWhen our team was distributing in Batase VDC of Sindhupalchok to the ethnic Tamang people, a big dispute erupted out of nowhere. As I proceeded to the crisis site, \u00a0I saw a small number of people asking for Tarps and food but some of Tamang youth were about to push them from the site. When I inquired about the small group, I found out they were from lower caste and they received less relief materials and their houses were fully destroyed. Despite their request of rice and tarps, the Tamang groups (also a minority) did not stop opposing the distribution. They were abusing the Dalits verbally, I was so struck by that event, and I left wondering if one marginalized group is trying to suppress another minority then what would an established caste do to the minorities during this crisis?\n\nWe all were in a hurry to reach the needy people of affected areas. But we constantly forgot so many things like supervision of the area to protect children and young girls who were the easy target for human traffickers and we somehow were lost in the emotional web that whenever some people came and told the story of people starving and the area was out of reach, we instantly dispatched the relief items without validating the event. We also could have included separate relief packages for infants, pregnant women, lactating mothers, children under 5, old aged people and differently-abled people because these people are in most vulnerable positions in this kind of catastrophic event. So demand validation and also a more efficient way of dispatching could have made the entire process a little more systematic. There were less co-ordination with another volunteer organization because we were overwhelmed by the demand for relief, and sometimes there used to be lack of volunteers to coordinate with other agencies.\u201d\n\n<strong>Helping hands</strong>\n\n\u201cI think we along with others \u00a0had little knowledge to approach this post earthquake relief work, but we reacted solving micro issues like calling for volunteers, mobilizing them, seeking donation, managing logistics, looking after supply chain of relief items, volunteers mobilized as wedge labor, coordination with government agency, validity of needs, supervision. With this experience we can probably handle more complicated issues in relief distribution work by finding out and curing weakness we had in this operation.\n\nWe contacted government from the first day of operation. We were first to get authority to carry out relief. We contacted every CDO office of respective district before dispatching the relief materials, we contacted security personnel for the security of our volunteers and logistics and they responded positively. We contacted District Health Offices (DHOs) to set emergency Health camps and we were given approval instantly. Some DHOs also took some medicine and surgical items from us. In Rasuwa Army and government health personnel joined our team to make emergency relief effort quick. It was two way coordination work and both sides managed to make positive impact.\u201d\n\n<strong>And the present</strong>\n\n\u201cRight now \\#Act4quake team has shifted its focus to rebuilding by organizing Youth work camp in remote village of Makwanpur, Nuwakot and Sindupalchok. A group of skilled volunteers were given orientation of the program and sent to the site to help rebuild temporary shelter by using local resources.\n\nOn individual level, I am working on sustainable reconstruction project for people of Chandeni Manden VDC Majhitar, this will be based on sustainable agricultural co-operative Model. I'll share the story once it is done completely.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n<em>And so the story ends. Or begins. \\#Act4quake is working persistently, and we hope to hear their stories more regularly. Thank you Kamal Bhatta (<a href=\"/u/samarthin\">@Samarthin</a>) for your time. We are waiting to hear more of your stories.</em>\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-18 11:36:18", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 14:34:43.839458", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1504, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31543, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 3675, "post_number": 23, "raw": "@Nadia, can you take a look at the wiki with the program tonight and check where your session would fit best? https://edgeryders.eu/en/node/3938/\n\n", "created_at": "2014-10-11 11:25:28", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:53.385574", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 29, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14489, "user_id": 1487, "topic_id": 2170, "post_number": 3, "raw": "some assumptions about this imaginary person:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>A woman age 35-45 with 1 or 2 children.</li>\n\n<li>Holds mid-level management position - indicating at least 4 or 5 years of experience in her current organziation/branch.</li>\n\n<li>Specializes in her field.</li>\n\n<li>Does not have direct control/access to budget.

He\u2019s been what we call a \u201cregular Kathmandu guy\u201d. He loves his friends and has a job he enjoys. His life, like the life of many of us, changed the day of the earthquake. Despite fears of security and amidst decisions of uncertainty, Abhinav chose to come out of his home within 72 hours. Not only did he manage to form a group with his friends, he successfully contributed in every way possible. We share his personal story.</em>\n\n<strong>An overview</strong>\n\nI asked him to start from the start. He explained his initiative pretty easily as \u201cgroup of friends who came together to purchase relief materials and distribute them to places around Kathmandu.\u201d \u201cThe places we went were remote except for distance which helped us as we could use cars some of us had to go to these places in the beginning. Later we started needing vans to accommodate the materials. For about ten days straight we went to places around Kathmandu where we heard relief materials were short or null. We just called ourselves \u2018Kathmandu Relief Team\u2019. After that most of us had to go back to our regular jobs. But at present, we are in the process of starting an organization for the education of children in the earthquake stricken areas,\u201d says Abhinav.\n\n<strong>Working as a team</strong>\n\n\u201cWe started working after 72 hours of the earthquake. About six of us went on the first day. The group grew to about 15. There were more than 30 of us in a few days. Through Viber groups and other social media most people would contact friends and those that were free were happy to join.\u201d \u2013 Abhinav Thakur\n\n<strong>Geographical location they accessed and resources they collected</strong>\n\n<em>It is very interesting to see what triggered them to work on a particular geographical location. How did they choose the area that required them the most? </em>\n\n\u201cWe talked about it. Temporary shelters, food materials and sanitation kits came up as immediate requirements so we focused on that. Regarding geographical areas, we went to places from general knowledge among the group through news, local contacts and so on. We talked about places we could go on Viber and we would come to consensus the night before.\u201d \u2013 Abhinav Thakur\n\n<strong>The process of learning</strong>\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much to learn once you spend time on the field. Firstly, we learnt building large tents. We learnt how to interact with people who are in need but don\u2019t think they are entitled and are grateful for the support. We learnt how to interact with people who are in need and think they are entitled and get remarkably angry at our shortcomings. We learnt how to coordinate human resource to optimize efforts. We learnt it is not a good idea to go to places that require support with too little material. Above all, we learnt relief work takes dedication and a little hard work but it is usually very rewarding.\n\nNepal seems to be able to cope. As people, we are one. People of all backgrounds came together to support people of all backgrounds. Suddenly, all the political questions had diminished. When people acted of their own accord outside of the political framework, there was no dividing line, just a united Nepal. I learnt about myself that I could work on the field ten days straight without breaks. But it was taxing and I have a newfound respect for social work. I salute the youth of today for being so fundamentally selfless when time demanded it. The young community it seems is ready to take over and do well.\u201d \u2013 Abhinav Thakur\u00a0\n\n<strong>More than a story</strong>\n\nI asked Abhinav to share a \u201cstory\u201d that has stuck with him after all these weeks. His answer made me regret calling it a story. It is a lesson that is rare and hard to forget. \u201cWe visited Alapot VDC on recommendation of one of the local people, Mr. Bharat Nagarkoti. When we were done distributing the relief material, we learnt Mr. Bharat himself didn\u2019t have a tent to live in. We arranged for a tent for him and that too, he gave to someone else. He said he could share a place to sleep. During times when one can panic into seeming to need everything that comes, some people can become altruistic. Hail humanity,\u201d said Abhinav.\n\n<strong>Learning by doing</strong>\n\n<em>There are always learning lessons from every experience. Given the same situation at present, what would they have wanted to do differently? </em>\n\n\u201cWe would like to be better funded. That would help with the relief packages. We could include solar lights and chargers. Also, having a source of fund that didn\u2019t need pictures as proof would help. It is sad to document grief in pictures. But finding such a source is unlikely. But mostly we would be more efficient from the first day. We would also like to be an organization of our own because that seems to garner better credibility among other organizations donating relief material.\u201d \u2013 Abhinav Thakur\n\n<strong>Co-ordination and Communication</strong>\n\n\u201cAID for Nepal is a Facebook group that helped massively and funded a couple of days of our mission. There were other online groups that helped with updating information. We went to CWIN and collected some materials for children like child\u2019s food kit, crayons etc. Organization called Samjhana helped with sanitary kits for women. We did meet the army at a couple of places. These were very polite individuals working very efficiently in the relief campaign. They would come to a place and finish building a tent in about seven minutes. We did not meet large NGO people but we did see some of their tents around. Red Cross, Oxfam, the Turkish group, Chinese Red Cross etc. We almost never came across the government in these places. Government on the local level seems absent in our context. We did meet one VDC secretary at one of the villages we visited but he could not even help us coordinate the distribution. At most places we came across ad-hoc committees formed by the youth of the locality doing as much as they could. They would always welcome us and help in the relief distribution. It was easy to work with them as they were very willing to do all that could help the locals breathe a sigh of relief.\u201d \u2013 Abhinav Thakur\n\n<strong>Take the experience to the future</strong>\n\n\u201cThe most important lesson from this experience to take to the future is that we as a nation are heavily underprepared for crisis scenarios. We as a group hope to make an impact now on the lives of some children who have been affected by this and to shield more from further crises through our future initiative.\u201d \u2013 Abhinav Thakur\n\n<em>I was extremely delighted to see a citizen driven initiative not particularly led by an individual but by a purpose making an impact in the relief aid. Congratulations to Abhinav Thakur and his friends. Your people needed you and you lived up to their expectation.</em>\n\n<em>Part 2 of this story introduces Srijan Silwal. Srijan is the \u201cfront man\u201d of the group. His story is inspirational, to say the very least.</em>\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-29 15:07:54", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 14:33:29.582383", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1276, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26913, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5522, "post_number": 12, "raw": "<b>Updated the activities list</b>\n\nThanks to @Rossana_Torri and @Nadia for their info.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-04-20 13:17:08", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:28.861495", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 17, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25773, "user_id": 1679, "topic_id": 4167, "post_number": 16, "raw": "<b>Fantastic!</b>\n\nYou're back from Rome?

A day, to leave all the busy routine work and worries behind to freely enjoy the world passing by. I too was enjoying my moment of relaxation and with the view of my beautiful front garden. A truly blissful sight to see beautiful flowers blooming, with shiny rain drops in their petal, left behind by the rain of previous night. I had seen our gardener plant the sapling a month before, and now I was enjoying the fruit of his hard work and effort.\n\nWith a wonderful feeling in my heart and head I gazed upon the sight before my eyes. With a feeling of proud ownership to my garden, I continued sipping my coffee while different thoughts passed my head. Just then a sense of comparison arose in my mind. My garden representing my country. The children of our nation as the gardeners and the bloomed flowers as the product of the gardener\u2019s hard work.\n\nIt is true, as I say we Nepalese love our motherland and fellow countrymen with our lives. And the current post earthquake disaster\u2019s situation clearly defines it. The unity and credibility that Nepalese have shown has been praised by global community worldwide. Now for the bitter truth, its true to say that marginal half the population would leave the country if opportunity strike for foreign settlement. Reason why? Well its simple, for the fact of living a better life.\n\nOur country falls under the list of underdeveloped nations, and we know it. Here we lack in all the sectors of development. Even for basic need fulfillment, it\u2019s a farfetch condition. People in this country still suffer and lose their life because of simple preventable diseases, lack of education and knowledge and ill practices. Yes, it may be justifiable to some extent for people to go abroad in search of better lives because when the country has nothing to offer why should the citizens suffer. But have we ever thought the justifiability from a nations point of view. At minimum 20 years an individual spends his/her life from birth to become a self supporting productive age group. A nation invests its valuable resources in an individual at the most vital period of time (non \u2013 productive age) in aim of reaping the result at the harvesting period (productive age), but this culture of immigration has lead bankruptcy of productive age from the nation. Thus, quality manpower decline and the nation suffers the loss.\n\nAn example can be taken from the condition of district Sindhupalchwock. After the devastating earthquake of 12th Baisakh, 2072 it was shockingly realized that 90% of the populations working group (economically-productive age group) have immigrated to foreign labor. Leaving only children and elderly in the district. From this I realized why our country is still falling far behind, despite having the quality and ability to grow into a prosperous nation. We always have a tendency to ask, have we realized it\u2019s time to give? Why do we ask what our country has given us? When we should be answering, why are our efforts and physical resources being spent in foreign land?\n\nI believe it\u2019s only possible for us to organize ourselves for the development of our nation when every individual can be dedicated and loyal to his/her country, then progress is evitable. How did Japanese and Germans build their nation after world war II? Through dedication and commitment. We are the gardeners of our garden. Its our duty and responsibility to keep our garden to is best condition. Bloom the garden with flowers of development. It may not sound as easy as it looks, but if we wish to see beautiful flowers bloom in our garden, then we should also be ready to dig the ground, get messy dirt all over our clothes, plant the sapling and nurture it with love and affection. It takes dedication and constant hard work but is worth the while when we see the end result, isn\u2019t it?\n\nEver individual should act within their capability and identify their responsibility. They should work in their field of expertise for continuous development, then only our nation can prosper. We all know the proverb, \u201cRome wasn\u2019t build in a day\u201d, don\u2019t we. A feeling of patriotism cannot be taught or given knowledge about. Its about building a moral character which we Nepalese have always stand for. We should start it within ourselves, say I care and I will do.\n\nAs I rested down my empty coffee mug, I proudly said to myself, \u201cI am a gardener of my garden\u201d.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-21 12:04:05", "updated_at": "2017-09-10 19:48:57.647698", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 790, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31729, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5720, "post_number": 21, "raw": "<b>Done</b>\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/en/openethnographer-codes-conversion-table\n\nThere is also a filter that can act as a search.

It is proposed that we meet this objective through the creation of short re-useable modules that can easily be taught in a peer-to-peer fashion in small groups - either online in a Google Hangout, or offline by downloading the material onto a tablet, laptop, or even a smart phone. We are calling these re-useable lessons or modules \"learning objects\".\n\nThe best way to understand the practice of getting involved in a course, or structuring and writing your own course is to see it in action. We will be starting next week a regular series of Hangouts in which we can answer questions and discuss proposals for projects or new courses.\u00a0Below is a more detailed introduction to the structure of a learning object.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">What is a learning object?</h3>\n\nA learning object is a structured set of media components that support group learning in the form of a short (one hour long) lesson. Each learning object is divided into 6 aspects:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>A short (no more than 10 minutes) video (with subtitles available in different languages)\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>An evolving set of links to online tools, references and further reading</li>\n\n<li>Dumb-assed questions - a collection of plain-language questions that a learner may have based on watching the video</li>\n\n<li>Practical exercises that a participant can practice during the hours session, or after in their own time.</li>\n\n<li>Requirements - things students need, and prior learning or knowledge they should know first</li>\n\n<li>Metadata - information about the learning object, tutors featured, difficulty, keywords etc</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nA group of learners should be able to meet in physical space or in an online Hangout, and take part in an hour long lesson supported by the material contained in the learning object. It is essential to the methodology that non-experts are able to lead a class of learners. It is equally important that these learning objects are as easy as possible to create. If a learning object does not exist for a given subject, then the first Hangout a group undertakes to tackle this subject will (with minimal editing) become a rough initial prototype learning object for the topic discussed and presented in the Hangout. Subsequent learners can take this material and improve it - wiki style.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">An Example</h3>\n\nTo picture this in concrete terms - if a group decides that it needs to learn more about mobile applications for Open Street Map, or to take another example the funding opportunities for language students in the EU, then the appointed team lead on this topic (referred to from now on as a viral teacher or tutor), can convene a Hangout to cover that topic in a weeks time. In the meantime the tutor, possible supported by other members of the team, can research the topic, and collect good online links and learning resources. An easy practical way for a team to do this is to use a social bookmarking tools such as <a href=\"https://www.diigo.com\">Diigo</a>\u00a0which allows software to read the RSS feed of these bookmarks into the learning object. The tutor then notes down a couple of basic questions, and a number of short exercises that people can do during the Hangout.\n\nThese notes are added to a structured post on the (currently Wordpress based) web site, and the Google Hangout is recorded as a Hangout on Air, so that the various sections can be cut into short pieces and attached as media object to the post. During the Hangout participants are encouraged to ask questions - the more naive the better, in order to answer any common misconceptions or misunderstandings - and these questions are also recorded.\n\nWe are working on a cross platform, desktop, mobile and tablet based app which is able to structure, automatically time, and record video presentations for these learning objects. The applications is designed to work even when offline, or out and about in a real-world situation. We are inviting people to take part in creating this mobile application as a Viral Academy course. In a similar way we can involve people in teaching them how to create a Wordpress sites for their own Viral Academy course, or in learning Drupal and in improving the EdgeRyders platform.\u00a0\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Multilingual Learning</h3>\n\nAn important aspect of learning objects, and the Viral Academy methodology, is the ability to use the material and to hold classes in your native language. The WordPress site has built in multilingual capabilities that work on a wiki-style principle. All uploaded text based material is automatically translated into a wide range of languages, and the translations can simply be corrected manually in place by clicking on an icon next to each sentence. In this way students wishing to learn English can take part in Viral Academy language courses, by joining a Hangout and discussing the topic as a group and live translating the content - English for Geeks is one of the first courses we would like to run.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Follow Up Courses for \\#futurespotters</h3>\n\nDue to the flexibility of this group learning methodology, it is ideally suited to running follow up courses on topics that have been selected during \\#futurespotter events, or other EdgeRyder events such as the forthcoming LOTE4. Breakout groups that have identified a particular topic of interest, and that wish to follow up on the discussions initiated, can structure a short series of Hangouts to further research the material, possibly leading to the building of software or other concrete deliverables.\n\nAs the usual methodology of such events is to appoint a spokesperson for the breakout group, and for this person to report back to the rest of the conference (and the EdgeRyders community at large), it is a natural step for this person to become a facilitator or viral teacher on a follow-up series of Hangouts. We are suggesting that any breakout group wishing to do this, would debate and propose 6 follow up events, either as physical meetups, or online Hangouts (or some combination of both), and schedule these on the EdgeRyder platform. Each of these meetups or Hangouts would result in the creation of a new learning object, with the material uploaded to the Viral Academy website, and summarised and posted to the EdgeRyders platform for wider discussion. Ideally these facilitators would also take a basic Viral Academy introductory course in the platforms and methodology used. This course would include a basic introduction to WordPress, Google Hangouts, agile project management, and on the Drupal based Wordpress site.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-05-22 00:07:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:24.590990", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1177, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16730, "user_id": 2464, "topic_id": 5990, "post_number": 18, "raw": "<b>Great move</b>\n\nHi @Moushira, this compilation is so great.

Opinionage is a work-in-progress project (we're a very early beta version). It means that features are strongly evolving almost on a bi-weekly basis. Reactions and expectations from our user-base are driving our development. As an example, in the next few days we'll clarify different roles played by users discussing a topic (ie who's the decision maker, who's following the discussion and so on..). We'll introduce the concept of \"featured topic\", real-time notifications, etc etc\n\n2. some of the contents are just \"topic tests\" posted by our user-base, some others are a little bit misleading (they're no more than polls). But we've decided to keep the database as it is.\n\nBack to your questions:\n\n1. I know we can be a general purpose tool. But we've decided to play as a \"changing world tool\", at least at this stage (it's a matter of strategy)\n\n2.\u00a0Yes, you're perfectly right: the current chance that users fit exactly a \"decision/timing\" is extremely low (or perhaps null!). But this is only one side of the medal (the only visible one, just now!). As I mentioned you before, we're working on \u00a0\"featured topics\": with Opinionage you will be able handle two different kind of processes: bottom-up or top-down: bottom-up are topics posted by citizens (exactly the ones you can see now). Top-down are opened by \"decision-makers\"... so by politicians (exactly what you suggested: \"....push out exactly those questions that they are addressing at the moment\").\n\n3. I know many organizations are reluctant to SaaS, but I'm not thinking to give the software \"in-house\". Think to Opinionage just like Google or Facebook: would you put them in-house? Of course no, because the power just comes from inter-connected services.\n\n4. To partially solve the \"ownership issues\", we'll release a set of API. Users will be able to access public data (our promise is: free service and public data access for people and no-profit organizations).\n\n(About the two points above: technically speaking we'll provide \"state-of-the-art\" features.. So, only bigger cities or institutions would be able to manage that complexity... I don't like the idea to serve only these ones!)\n\n5. Yes, you're right. Administrations are intimidated by citizens (at least in Italy). My personal experience in USA is just a little bit different...and I hope it will change in the really next future (furthermore tools like Opinionage should offer tools to moderate the discussion, social control and so on)\n\n6. The polarization is just the \"label of the topic\", then you can modulate your thoughts by posting comments and animating the debate. We decided to give just only two options because (unfortunately) the world is becoming more and more shallow... and simple claims (Oxford style: 2 alternatives) allows a simpler/easier broad communication.

"raw": "Dear lovely Edgeryders,\n\nThis post is a bit late (better than ever, right?!) but I've been busy with other events in Europe before heading back to Dubai, and when I managed to have some free time, I preferred to go out and photowalk instead of setting in my hotel room!\n\nI'm sharing with you here some thoughts\u00a0and\u00a0reflections I've complied during my participation in \\#LOTE and \\#Edgecamp. Being written by an Edgeryder from outside the EU, you might find these thoughts interesting, different, silly or whatever you call it!\n\nBefore heading to any event, I usually put a list of objectives I want to achieve through this event, but I knew that the \\#LOTE &amp; \\#Edgecamp will be different. However, I didn't have a crystal clear picture on how \"different\" they will be although I've created the Arabic subtitle for the project intro video months ago and spent a good time on the platform learning about the project and interacting with other Edgeryders. So I decided to put a simple clear objective in my mind: Keep Discovering! (btw this iss the old motto of Emirates Airline!)\n\nAs a man passionate about citizen (specially youth) engagement in making the needed transition in societies mainly via making a shift in the way governments do their business, I had the following initial list of questions in my mind, and I was looking forward to discover the answers during the event:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>How will the rich online\u00a0dialog\u00a0and interaction across the community on the platform be moved to the offline gathering?</li>\n\n<li>To what extent are the EU institutions and politicians serious about having the youth at the heart of the \u00a0the needed changes in \u00a0institution\u00a0setup and \u00a0policy making mechanisms to survive the current crises and pursue the future those youth aspire?</li>\n\n<li>More specifically: How can the Edgeryders and the EU politicians and\u00a0institutions\u00a0have a\u00a0fruitful\u00a0dialog during the event? And can this dialog be orchestrated in a way that increases the chances of reaching the desired outcome?</li>\n\n<li>We live in a global connected world, so what can I learn from the youth in Europe? What do I have to offer them? Do we share the same dreams and challenges? Can we adopt similar approaches and solutions ?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nDays after the event, I can't say that I have founded clear answers to all these questions, but I storngly believe\u00a0that my observations and interactions during \\#LOTE and \\#Edgecamp have put me on he right track.\n\nThe first positive and important signal I received was having \\#LOTE organized inside the premises of \u00a0Council of Europe. \u00a0I know this was announced prior to the event but living the moment was different, the moment when the Edgeryders \"occupied\" the ground floor (or was it the 2nd floor?!) on the first day and then listened to\u00a0<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/96703/Emilie_TURUNEN.html\" style=\"color: rgb(204, 102, 0); line-height: 1.5; \" target=\"_blank\">Emilie Turunen</a>, member of the European Parliament who from Denmark\u00a0<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ibadawi/7468475332/in/set-72157630345962018\" style=\"color: rgb(204, 102, 0); line-height: 1.5; \" target=\"_blank\">delivering very honest and to the point opening remarks</a>. I quote her: \"<em style=\"line-height: 1.5; border: none; \">It 's never been as worst when it comes to\u00a0unemployment\u00a0as it is now, and I\u00a0think\u00a0we need an extraordinary effort from this generation to really change the whole direction of Europe</em>\"\n\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"410\" src=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/sites/edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/files/lote_mep.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"307\">\n\nI'm not deeply aware of the setup of the Council of Europe or EU institutions and their policy making mechanisms but I saw this as a very positive way to commence the event. This point was further emphasized on during the \\#LOTE &amp; \\#Edgecamp through the balance between youth and politicians participation (e.g. in the panels).\u00a0\u00a0However, the most important part is yet to come, that's to see how this dialogue will continue \u00a0to deliver specific policy outcomes that meet or come very close to the dreams of Edgeryders.\n\nThen I discovered that my first question was wrong! Just wrong! Instead of \"moving\" the online discussion to the offline event, make them in sync and mashed up. Remember the tweetwall? yes that's it! It hasn't only enriched the discussion but also helped in connecting the offline gathering with remote Edgeryders who couldn't make it to event and also timely documenting the discussed issues so we can continue talking about it post the event.\n\nTalking about dialog, another positive important observation was the diversity of the Edgeryders! It was just amazing, the diversity in backgrounds, experiences, specializations,\u00a0interests, views .. and languages! My favorite two ways to\u00a0describe\u00a0this are the following: first the instant translation in the\u00a0conference\u00a0room and how important it was! Remember when Nadia used to\u00a0interrupt a participant when she/he forgets to turn on the mice and say something like: the mic please, translators can't hear you?! that was an \"aha moment\" for me! I knew that there are so many languages other than English in Europe (the\u00a0<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http://europa.eu/\" style=\"color: rgb(204, 102, 0); line-height: 1.5; \" target=\"_blank\">EU homepage</a>\u00a0has 23\u00a0languages), and I was expecting and looking forward \u00a0to a multi-lingual gathering but again it's different when you live it specially that I came from a part of the world where English is considered the common language for\u00a0communicating\u00a0and doing business. I even took this picture from inside the\u00a0European\u00a0Parliament\u00a0in Brussels where they ahve 13\u00a0cabinets\u00a0for the translators. \u00a0I loved that!\n\nThe other way to describe it is the diversity of the topics posted on the wall during the \\#Edgecamp: video games, aliens,\u00a0<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ibadawi/7468799332/in/set-72157630346545346\" style=\"color: rgb(204, 102, 0); line-height: 1.5; \" target=\"_blank\">open data</a>, fashion, voting systems and the list goes on! and documented\u00a0it in\u00a0<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ibadawi/7468802376/in/set-72157630346545346/lightbox/\" style=\"color: rgb(204, 102, 0); line-height: 1.5; \" target=\"_blank\">photo\u00a0</a>of\u00a0course.\n\nDuring the second day of \\#LOTE, I was enchanted by the process adopted in the We The People session \u00a0to identify the\u00a0<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ibadawi/7468657356/in/set-72157630345962018\" style=\"color: rgb(204, 102, 0); line-height: 1.5; \" target=\"_blank\">challenges\u00a0</a>and then\u00a0<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ibadawi/7468577146/in/set-72157630345962018\" style=\"color: rgb(204, 102, 0); line-height: 1.5; \" target=\"_blank\">working in smaller groups</a>\u00a0to brainstorm, discuss and come out with specific\u00a0<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ibadawi/7468660066/in/set-72157630345962018\" style=\"color: rgb(204, 102, 0); line-height: 1.5; \" target=\"_blank\">policy recommendations</a>\u00a0in a limited time span.\n\nOne of my favorite moments during \\#LOTE and \\#Edgecamp was the one-to-one conversations I had with most of you Edgeryders, I enjoyed listening to the story being told from a different angle every time. \u00a0I found out that we share the same dreams, motivations and values \u00a0to a great extent, but more important the\u00a0determination\u00a0to pursue these dreams. Also, the context most of the Edgeryders live (i.e. EU) has many common features with the context I live in here (i.e Arab region) specially when it comes to the energy and the potential of the young generations. But also, I've noticed clear contextual differences. \u00a0The key one to me is your ability to FREELY think and pursue your dreams, I'm talking here about much much fewer sociopolitical constrains and limitations you have in Europe as compared to the Arab region. I had an interesting discussion about this point with other Edgeryders during the Social Media and Arab Spring discussion at the \\#EdgeCamp.\n\nSo let's leverage the common dreams and values we have to exchange the rich various experiences we gained through these different conditions. We live in a very connected world, and we have a lot to exchange and learn from each other.\n\nI would like to sincerly thank Alerto, Nadia and Council of Europe for this opportunity. Thank you Lyne Robichaud for introducing me to this great community!\n\nAnd big thank, Merci and Shokran to each one on of you Edgeryders for this great eye-opening experience, hope to join you again in similar gathering in the future.\n\nI arrived at \\#LOTE with the old Emirate's motto: Keep Discovering...\n\nBut now,\u00a0<strong style=\"line-height: 1.5; \">let's continue Living on The Edge with the new Emirat's' motto in mind:\u00a0<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http://www.emirates.com/ae/english/index.aspx\" style=\"color: rgb(204, 102, 0); line-height: 1.5; \" target=\"_blank\">Hello Tomorrow</a>!</strong>\n\n", "created_at": "2012-07-02 08:37:31", "updated_at": "2017-11-13 22:18:03.306141", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1963, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 10.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17488, "user_id": 3416, "topic_id": 715, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>About social clinic</b>\n\nYes, in fact there is a social clinic in Thessaloniki.

it may only periodically provoke symptoms of schizophrenia.\u00a0 However there exists an enormous grey zone between acquiring a few meager all-purpose defensive phrases, and the leap required to successfully employ them.\n\nPeople vary.\u00a0 Having once survived a linguistic transplant may provide you sufficient faith with which to successfully negotiate the process a third or fourth time; still it is also possible to harbour the opposite allergic reaction of \u2018never again\u2019.\u00a0 Those whose personal history has never forced them into the position of a linguistic minority may never have embraced the pleasure.\n\nUnMonasterians are dependent upon nuanced, intricate communication with their host communities.\u00a0 Some things can go through the filter of translators, some cracks can be circumvented via significant ritual.\u00a0 Goodwill goes a long way. \u00a0 However to augment our capacity to have an effective presence in the field, every technique to build our linguistic proficiency should be incorporated into our daily practice.\n\nThe Materan flagship prototype quickly confronted exactly this dilemma; a mixture of uniphones, polyglots, native speakers and the chronically stubborn perched on the outer rim of effective public education had a thankless task.\u00a0 In our practical reality, the mental gymnastics to absorb and actify Italian had to occur as we hit the beach.\u00a0 The truncated projected presence for a mere four months was inhuman at best.\u00a0 Lacking the resources of the KGB to bombard the unMonks with the hyper-learning techniques employing hypnosis, sleep deprivation, somatic feedback mechanisms and God knows what else, we were more or less up to our own initiative...\n\nThe latest contribution to language acquisition is the free net-based services set up by benevolence entities such as the EU.\u00a0 A few hardy souls ventured out into the wilds of\u00a0<em>Duolingo</em>\u00a0to expose themselves to a scattering of rudimentary elements.\u00a0 It is useful enough to increase familiarity with basics, but even when amplified by its in-built system of compete with your friends, it hardly provides a hands-on deep learning experience.\n\nOur early duties at the unMo had to do with other survival skills.\u00a0 Shivering was a universal that didn\u2019t require an interpreter.\u00a0 Eating was largely preverbal; recurring spells of \u2018<em>excommunication</em>\u2019 (unMo-speak for prolonged internet disconnectivity) left us virtually speechless.\u00a0 If civilized conversation was indeed\u00a0 indulged in, it was largely saved for cursing the Gods.\u00a0 When we finally opened our mouths it was to invoke a \u2018no complaining\u2019 clause that forced us to shut them again.\u00a0 The temptation to exist in a cloud of flawed or over-verbose English was irresistible.\n\nTo prime the transition to an active bilingual lifestyle, a subtle\u00a0<em>Italiano\u00a0</em>component was inserted into the finale

Here's a few remarks.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>As you say, stability of results is interesting in itself. Is the community influencing its members? My hunch is no, it is not, because decentralised consensus is invisible. But maybe there is even a way to test for it empirically... I have to think about it.</li>\n\n<li>Maybe I spent too much time staring at <a href=\"http://164.132.58.138:9000/#/dashboard/tagViewFull\">GraphRyder</a>, but this looks to me like communities of codes. For example, your point 4 is mirrored by the ego network of <code class=\"content-output\">legality</code> (for clarity, filtered to edge strength &gt; 4 in the picture):\u00a0\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/aac2e41b358c5dbacc1552ebdd93f677fbc9c3c8.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"444\">\n</li>\n\n<li>Your point 2 is even clearer. Look how the ego network of <code class=\"content-output\">mental health</code> is nicely clustered together in a corner of the graph, and how it connects to <code class=\"content-output\">creativity</code>, <code class=\"content-output\">art and health care</code>, <code class=\"content-output\">story sharing</code>, <code class=\"content-output\">resilience</code>\u00a0and <code class=\"content-output\">community-based care</code>\u00a0, even when filtering out the weak edges. So, I am wondering whether a community detection algorithm could be a good way to assemble (or validate) an ethnographic report starting from the coded data. What do you think, @melancon and @Jason_Vallet ? @Amelia : community detection here means an algorithmic way of finding groups of codes that are more strongly connected with other codes in the same group than with codes in other groups. This could be a neat methodological innovation, in the sense that grouping concepts into blocks would be done algorithmically. If you use Louvain modularity, you even get a parameter (normalised between 0 and 1)\u00a0of how clean these groups are cut.\u00a0\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/4/4359d550f72bdf5c57911efb3c27cdd180d54a40.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"342\">\n</li>\n\n<li>In this post, I find it particularly interesting when you \"zoom in\" from \"XYZ appears to be important\" to \"here is the community's concrete take on \u00a0XYZ\". Example from your\u00a0point 4: self-regulation; making rules for spaces; open processes, even open science. Unfortunately, this emerges less neatly from the graph!\u00a0I recommend you do this for each point.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>As for the hyperlink question: I would like sometimes to drill down, but if you put 60 links in a post you are going to make it unreadable. Maybe limit it to 2-3 per major point?</li>\n\n</ul>", "created_at": "2017-05-31 17:45:39", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:58.232417", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 489, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 1.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6819, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3049, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>The Chronicler</b>\n\nThis is a good and useful report, thanks Bembo.

(<a href=\"http://lynerobichaud.blogspot.com/2011/02/lecon-no4-de-leadership-laction.html\">http://lynerobichaud.blogspot.com/2011/02/lecon-no4-de-leadership-laction.html</a>) Des gestionnaires gouvernementaux qui agissent en mod\u00e8les d\u2019excellence, orient\u00e9s vers l'action. \"Ai-je fait ce que j'ai dit que je ferais?\". Prendre des risques, demander du feed-back, etc.\n\n<strong>RELATION PERVERSE</strong>\n\nCes derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, j\u2019ai tent\u00e9 de trouver des explications du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la psychiatrie. Les travaux de la (Fran\u00e7aise) Dre Marie-France Hirigoyen (<a href=\"http://www.mariefrance-hirigoyen.com/\">http://www.mariefrance-hirigoyen.com/</a>) sur le harc\u00e8lement moral, l\u2019emprise et la violence perverse au quotidien, m\u2019ont fait d\u00e9couvrir le mod\u00e8le de la relation perverse: refuser la communication directe; d\u00e9former le message; mentir, manier le sarcasme, la d\u00e9rision et le m\u00e9pris; user du paradoxe; disqualifier; diviser pour mieux r\u00e9gner. Initialement, mes recherches concernaient les relations entre individus, mais je me suis rendue compte que la relation perverse existe malheureusement aussi \u00e0 une plus grande \u00e9chelle, dans un contexte politique. En observant les discussions et relations entre \u00e9lus et gestionnaires gouvernementaux, j\u2019ai remarqu\u00e9 que les diverses facettes de la relation perverse sont souvent \u00e0 l\u2019\u0153uvre. Si ce type de relation est en place entre \u00e9lus et d\u00e9cideurs, il pourrait se r\u00e9p\u00e9ter aussi dans les relations avec les citoyens.\n\nTant que les d\u00e9cideurs gouvernementaux demeureront dans ce mod\u00e8le, ils auront de s\u00e9rieuses difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 implanter un gouvernement ouvert.\n\nLa communication perverse consiste, selon la psychiatre Dr Marie-France Hirigoyen, en \u00ab<em>la mise en place de l'emprise utilise des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s qui donnent l'illusion de la communication - une communication particuli\u00e8re, non pas faite pour relier, mais pour \u00e9loigner ou emp\u00eacher l'\u00e9change. Cette distorsion dans la communication a pour but d'utiliser l'autre</em>.\u00bb\n\n<strong>Refuser la communication directe</strong>\n\nLe refus du dialogue est une fa\u00e7on de dire, sans l'exprimer directement avec des mots, que l'autre ne vous int\u00e9resse pas ou m\u00eame qu'il n'existe pas. Avec n'importe quel autre interlocuteur, si on ne comprend pas, on peut poser des questions. Avec les \u00abpervers\u00bb, le discours est tortueux, sans explication, et conduit \u00e0 l'ali\u00e9nation mutuelle.\n\n<strong>D\u00e9former le langage</strong>\n\nLe message est d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment flou et impr\u00e9cis, entretenant la confusion. Un \u00e9lu ou gestionnaire peut dire \u00ab<em>Je n'ai jamais dit cela</em>\u00bb, et \u00e9viter tout reproche. Offrant des propos dans lien logique, il entretient la coexistence de diff\u00e9rents discours contradictoires.\u00a0 Ce qui importe dans le discours, c'est la forme plut\u00f4t que le fond, para\u00eetre savant pour noyer le poisson.\n\n<strong>Mentir</strong>\n\nPlus souvent qu'un mensonge directe, un \u00e9lu ou gestionnaire a recours \u00e0 un assemblage de sous-entendus, de non-dits, destin\u00e9s \u00e0 cr\u00e9er un malentendu pour ensuite l'exploiter \u00e0 son avantage. Dans son trait\u00e9 'L'art de la guerre', r\u00e9dig\u00e9 vers le Ve si\u00e8cle avant J-C, le Chinois Sun Tse enseignait: \u00ab<em>L'art de la guerre est l'art de duper, en se donnant toujours l'apparence contraire de ce que l'on est, on augmente les chances de victoire.</em>\u00bb Dire sans dire est une fa\u00e7on habile de faire face \u00e0 toute situation. Un type de mensonge indirect consiste \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre de fa\u00e7on impr\u00e9cise ou \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9, ou par une attaque qui fait diversion.\u00a0\n\nQuoi que l'on dise, les \u00abpervers\u00bb (narcissiques) trouvent toujours un moyen d'avoir raison. V\u00e9rit\u00e9 ou mensonge, cela importe peu pour ces personnes. Ce qui est vrai est ce qu'ils disent dans l'instant. Ces falsifications de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 sont parfois tr\u00e8s proches d'une \u00abconstruction d\u00e9lirante\u00bb. C'est ainsi que l'on voit ces personnes entourer leur histoire d'un grand myst\u00e8re qui induit une croyance chez l'autre sans que rien n'ait \u00e9t\u00e9 dit: cacher pour montrer sans dire.\n\n<strong>Manier le sarcasme, la d\u00e9rision, le m\u00e9pris</strong>\n\nVis-\u00e0-vis le monde ext\u00e9rieur, ce qui domine est le m\u00e9pris, la d\u00e9rision. Le m\u00e9pris est l'arme du faible: il est une protection contre des sentiments ind\u00e9sirables. On se cache derri\u00e8re un masque d'ironie ou de plaisanterie. Toutes les remarques d\u00e9sagr\u00e9ables constituent des blessures qui ne sont pas compens\u00e9es par des marques de gentillesses.\n\nPour d\u00e9stabiliser l'autre, il suffit de:\n\n- se moquer de ses convictions, de ses choix politiques, de ses go\u00fbts;\n\n- ne plus lui adresser la parole;\n\n- le ridiculiser en public;\n\n- le d\u00e9nigrer devant les autres;\n\n- le priver de toute possibilit\u00e9 de s'exprimer;\n\n- se gausser de ses points faibles;\n\n- faire des allusions d\u00e9sobligeantes, ne jamais les expliciter;\n\n- mettre en doute ses capacit\u00e9s de jugement et de d\u00e9cision.\n\n<strong>User du paradoxe</strong>\n\nSun Tse enseigne \u00e9galement que, pour gagner une guerre, il faut diverse l'arm\u00e9e ennemie avant m\u00eame de commencer la bataille: \u00ab<em>Sans donner de batailles, t\u00e2chez d'\u00eatre victorieux</em>.\u00bb\u00a0 Dans une \u00abagression perverse\u00bb, on assiste \u00e0 une tentative d'\u00e9branler l'autre, de le faire douter de ses pens\u00e9es, de ses affects. Le but est de nier tout en paralysant.\u00a0 Le paradoxe vient le plus souvent du d\u00e9calage entre les paroles qui sont dites et le ton sur lequel ces paroles sont prolif\u00e9r\u00e9es. Le paradoxe consiste \u00e9galement \u00e0 faire ressentir \u00e0 l'autre de la tension et de l'hostilit\u00e9 sans que rien ne soit exprim\u00e9 \u00e0 son \u00e9gard. Un discours paradoxal rend l'autre perplexe.\n\n<strong>Disqualifier</strong>\n\nIl s'agit de retirer \u00e0 l'autre toute qualit\u00e9, de lui dire et de lui r\u00e9p\u00e9ter qu'il ne vaut rien, jusqu'\u00e0 l'amener \u00e0 le penser. La disqualification \u00e0 travers l'usage du paradoxe, du mensonge et d'autres proc\u00e9d\u00e9s sont destin\u00e9s \u00e0 enfoncer l'autre pour mieux se rehausser.\n\n<strong>Diviser pour mieux r\u00e9gner</strong>\n\nSun Tse dit encore: \u00ab<em>Troublez le gouvernement adverse, semez la dissension chez les chefs en excitant la jalousie ou la m\u00e9fiance, provoquez l'indiscipline, fournissez des causes de m\u00e9contentement</em>\u00bb. L\u00e0 o\u00f9 le \u00abpervers narcissique\u00bb excelle, c'est dans l'art de monter les gens les uns contre les autres, de provoquer des rivalit\u00e9s. La jouissance supr\u00eame pour un \u00abpervers\u00bb est de faire accomplir la destruction d'un individu par un autre et d'assister \u00e0 ce combat d'o\u00f9 les deux sortiront affaiblis, ce qui renforcera sa toute-puissance personnelle.\n\n<strong>CORRUPTION</strong>\n\nUn autre contexte d\u00e9favorable \u00e0 l\u2019implantation d\u2019un gouvernement ouvert est la corruption. L\u2019infiltration de la corruption dans les structures gouvernementales ne pousse pas les d\u00e9cideurs \u00e0 la transparence.\n\nLa corruption est d\u00e9finie comme \u00abune perversion ou d\u00e9tournement d'un processus ou d'une interaction avec une ou plusieurs personnes dans le dessein, pour le corrupteur, d'obtenir des avantages ou des pr\u00e9rogatives particuli\u00e8res ou, pour le corrompu, d'obtenir une r\u00e9tribution en \u00e9change de sa bienveillance. Elle conduit en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00e0 l'enrichissement personnel du corrompu ou \u00e0 l'enrichissement de l'organisation corruptrice (groupe mafieux, entreprise, club,\u00a0<abbr title=\"et cetera\">etc.).</abbr>\n\nPar ailleurs, l'assembl\u00e9e parlementaire du <a href=\"http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conseil_de_l%27Europe\" title=\"Conseil de l'Europe\">Conseil de l'Europe</a> d\u00e9finit la corruption comme \u00abl'utilisation et l'abus du pouvoir public \u00e0 des fins priv\u00e9es\u00bb. Pour la Commission des communaut\u00e9s europ\u00e9ennes, \u00abla corruption est li\u00e9e \u00e0 tout abus de pouvoir ou toute irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 commis dans un processus de d\u00e9cision en \u00e9change d'une incitation ou d'un avantage indu\u00bb.\n\n", "created_at": "2011-11-26 16:20:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:46.465352", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2214, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28501, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1129, "post_number": 12, "raw": "<b>Great to hear it!</b>\n\nNicely done, Nikolas!

And since someone has to start ... here we go.</h3>\n\nFailure. Success. Wow, what a wide and rich topic.\n\nMy guess is, since you're about to spend 3,5 days of your life in this area of inquiry, it touched something. You might be as intrigued as me, because something wants to be explored on an intellectual or emotional, collective or personal level. What we apparently share is an interest for failure (success?) and I assume that we also share a common interest in \"let's make more sense of this!\". I might as well be wrong, and that's exactly what I'm trying to find out.\n\nSo, would you please let me know\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">Why are you coming to Brussels?</h2>\n\nI can tell you my \"why\". If you're challenged by emotional content, leave this page NOW. Then better don't read, just reply :) Don't tell me I didn't warn you.\n\nI'm very excited to meet you all soon, but what the \"why\" brought up for me, hasn't been an easy ride so far. As soon as I stepped into the topic of failure, my relationship to it got a lot clearer and it was not always pretty to face. I had not been aware how much of a chicken I was, how eager I was to avoid failing (or what I perceived as such).\n\nOne example: I teach a very efficient self-help method to release stress and other emotional baggage. Some years ago, I was asked by the manager of our local branch of a huge swedish clothing company to coach their team, so they could handle the daily stress in the store better. I was over the moon - and dead shit scared. Too scared. GODDAMNIT!!\n\nWhen reflecting now on the topic of success vs. failure, I realized: This thing called failure, that many of us fear, but to a different degree, is what has kept me from doing lots of things in the past. Wasn't this one of my \"biggest\" failures so far: letting the fear of it take control? I believe so.\n\nThis is what brings me to Brussels. I want to de-demonize the \"F\", address it more directly and with others instead of within my isolated brain. Talk about it. Listening deeply to others and share the humanness behind the story of failure/success, find the questions that open up new spaces, look at the assumptions we hold individually and collectively and mold this thing called \"failure\" into another form. Rewrite the story of success and make more peace with this perceived threat. In the end, it's my decision which story I live in, what failure means to me and how I let the meaning I give it affect my life.\n\nThat's why I'm coming. Partly. It was, what caught my attention. Now I'm really happy that other topics I care about are being touched: Care, for example. I'm very interested in the topic of how to unfail \"care\", since I work in this area, and I'm not on the edge, but far far off it. And the 3. \"why\" is that I want to have a blast with all of you :)\n\nAnd why are you coming? :) In case you think you gotta soul strip now, too: naah! I just want to know what is \"in the room\" already. Partly because that's an aspect of <a href=\"/en/lote5/the-mother-of-documentation\">harvesting </a>during the event.

To get a less filtered view of the event, check out the \\#knwlb <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&amp;q=%23knwlb&amp;src=typd\">Twitter stream</a>.\n\nIn this piece, I\u2019m going to very briefly summarize what I learned about the practice of foresight and futures studies (roughly interchangeable terms), share some thoughts about what it means to \u201cuse the future\u201d (a key theme of the convening), and ask, essentially, \u201cwho is foresight for?\u201d Or, in other word, Who can use the future? In a follow up note, I will share some resources I gathered at the event to put the idea of \u201cforesight\u201d into practical perspective, in case readers would like to use the future, too.\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">What is foresight?</h2>\n\n<em>Foresight is a practice in search of a theory. \u2013 overheard at Knowlab </em>\n\nForty days ago, I had not heard of \u201cforesight\u201d as a profession or community of practice, which means that anything I have to say about it has both the benefit and handicap of a newcomer\u2019s perspective. I was somewhat relieved to learn I hadn\u2019t missed something obvious in my work to date when I read in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foresight_\">Wikipedia article on foresight</a> (futures_studies) that it is a practice that has played out largely in European governance and civil society (I am based in the US). But foresight has become a global pursuit. At the event, I learned that a major university in Taiwan (I believe <a href=\"http://www2.tku.edu.tw/~tddx/en/1-4.htm\">Tamkang University</a> ) requires all of its students to take a course in futures studies \u2013 which means that the discipline has been incorporated into the higher education of 80,000 people in that region. One participant informed me that there are roughly 1,000 active foresight professionals worldwide.\n\nFor others new to foresight, I think it is helpful to point out that practitioners define their work in contrast to the predictions made by \u201cpop futurists\u201d (think <a href=\"http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/engineering/future-that-never-was-next-gen-tech-concepts#slide-1\">Popular Mechanics</a>  or <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2013/01/2013-the-way-we-were/\">Wired magazine</a> ). In fact, that is why you will almost always see the word \u201cfutures\u201d in its plural form when interacting with the field.\n\nThe construction of multiple scenarios is a key method in foresight.I learned to think of foresight work as reverse engineering long-term planning and policy decisions using multiple, divergent potential futures as starting points. The promise that this approach can lead to more adaptive, resilient policy processes suited for a increasingly unpredictable world is a consistent theme in the foresight field. Foresight embraces and attempts to operationalize (or make useful) lessons learned from complexity science and systems theory, using both quantitative and qualitative social science methods. It is possible the field lacks a unifying theory, but that is likely a consequence of the fact that futures methods are usually applied in policy and institutional planning.  \n\nOne of the simplest explanations I received during the event is that foresight makes explicit often implicit assumptions along the dimensions of:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Plausible futures based on what we know about current systems.</li>\n\n<li>Probable futures derived from known current trends of change.</li>\n\n<li>Possible futures concerned with low-probability, high impact events (aka \u201cblack swans [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory]).</li>\n\n<li>Preferable futures which introduce a wider scope of choice and human agency in creating best possible outcomes.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nIn my own work exploring the <a href=\"http://philanthrogeek.com\">innovative edge of philanthropy</a>, I have seen a pattern where the plausible and the probable become enemies of the preferable when discussing the field\u2019s potential for change. In other words, \u201cwell that\u2019s not very likely to happen\u201d becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy that limits the range of design for excellence. So I felt that I had met some fellow travelers at Knowlab when I discovered that most of the energy and excitement of the field has to do with generating preferable futures.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/4/457ef73f3594df116525a27d6824a290dda9ba5d.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"416\"><br>\n\n<em>Image source: <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ro7dVInkrg5J5ZTTK8w_DGOf_SXG2DJT\">Don't Stop Thinking About Tomorrow</a>, by Jessica Bland and Stian Westlake</em>\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">Using the future?</h2>\n\nThe key organizer of Knowlab, Riel Miller of UNESCO, wants more people and institutions to \u201cuse the future\u201d in creating collective decisions today. At first, I wrestled with this phrase, \u201cuse the future.\u201d Does \u201cthe future\u201d exist? If the future exists, it is ephemeral, uncertain by definition, and highly contested. Meanwhile, most people are struggling to prepare for very immediate futures in daily, weekly, quarterly, or sometimes annual time frames. It was difficult for me to imagine anything so far out of touch being of much use to anyone.  \n\nNot so long ago conceptual frameworks like complexity science or \u201cdesign thinking\u201d were arcane terms, but more recently their influence is being felt in many areas. The conceptual leap I had to make to understand \u201cusing the future\u201d is that futures exist in our individual and collective imaginations. Anticipation is a deeply human trait, and our anticipations for the future, both long and short-term, inform our daily decisions by shaping our understanding of the range of possibilities before us. In some sense, those futures use us. Riel and his colleagues are offering a \u201cdiscipline of anticipation\u201d to create greater moments of agency and choice as we enter uncertain times.\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">Who is foresight for?</h2>\n\nSetting my deeper questions aside, it is clear that some people are using the future already. And those people tend to lead large, well-financed institutions that make policy decisions that affect the lives of millions. UNESCO, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the JRC are just a few examples of institutions invested in using the field of foresight in their planning and decision processes.\n\nIt is clear to me that foresight practitioners working with influential institutions are aware of and concerned about the bias an institution\u2019s agenda can introduce into a foresight process. The idea that the future can be a \u201csafe place for reflection and exploration\u201d was a common theme at the event and in the literature I have scanned since. However, I get a sense that this often translates into safe places for institutional staff and advisors to explore the possible and the preferable freed from the day-to-day politics and bureaucratic constraints of their organizations.\n\nI learned of several cases where such institutions attempted to convene diverse participants into their processes. However, I get the sense that this often means \u201cdiverse experts\u201d or that participants are identified and recruited by experts. The institutional allegiance to \u201cexpertise\u201d can introduce its own set of biases, and spaces controlled by large institutions and their circle of advisors may or may not be perceived as \u201csafe\u201d by any number of people whose input would generate value.\n\nExpertise is a problematic construction in a networked world. First of all, the rapid pace of change calls established expertise into constant question. Knowledge is so widely available that it can be acquired and utilized without institutional credentials or recognition. Additionally, networked individuals and \u201csmall groups\u201d can now have the kind of influence in shaping the future that was once only attainable by incorporated organizations controlling large resource pools, introducing a new element of chaos and unpredictability into the system, while simultaneously generating new areas of knowledge and expertise \u201con the ground\u201d where geopolitical and economic changes are experienced first hand.\n\nSo, can anyone use the future or do foresight exercises need to originate from foresight professionals? Can foresight professionals share their tools and democratize the practice? Are they willing to lose some \u201cownership\u201d of the practice, and are they open to seeing what can happen with futures imagined at the grassroots level? In any case, who is the primary beneficiary of foresight activities? If futurists want more people to \u201cuse the future,\u201d it is incumbent upon them to articulate the value of their practices. As someone who has incorporated elements of foresight (systems theory, the power of narrative, etc.) into my work without being aware of the field of foresight and future, I am convinced that there is enormous value here. But how does it translate into a broader network of new practitioners and how do those translations return and inform the professional field?\n\nMeanwhile, I would argue that leaders and networks outside of the field of professional foresight have been using the future quite successfully. <a href=\"http://europeandcis.undp.org/blog/?s=edgeryders\">Edgeryders</a> is one example. A colleague of mine, <a href=\"http://blog.art21.org/2014/06/24/black-futurism-the-creative-destruction-and-reconstruction-of-race-in-contemporary-art/#.VBeMkEvLhG5\">Nettrice Gaskins</a>, is incorporating frameworks of Afrofuturism and black futurism into art criticism and integrating what she\u2019s learning into Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) training for young people often marginalized by traditional educational practices. I also think about <a href=\"https://alliedmedia.org\">Allied Media Projects</a>, which has been convening grassroots change makers for sixteen years to leverage media and technology for social change. In recent years, AMP has taken an explicitly futurist turn, incorporating science fiction motifs and exercises to re-imagine the future of Detroit (its home base) from a technologically empowered grassroots up. In re-imagining Detroit, AMP is opening new spaces for the futures of all post-industrial cities and connecting with global participants.\n\nIn other words, the future is not the sole domain of the full-time futurists. If there is a shared goal for more people to use the future, I hope the foresight field will take a broader view of where futures expertise lives. I believe there is a lot of potential in sharing what has been learned in formal futures and foresight settings, but conversely a lot for the field to learn from those who are actively embracing and creating futures, but may be too involved in that creation to date to have connected with the formal networks of the futures field. The future is potential. I only hope that potential is universally accessible and useful.", "created_at": "2014-09-16 06:20:31", "updated_at": "2018-04-27 13:12:51.926678", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1811, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 20.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1935], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7917, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1225, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Faith, hope, love</b>\n\nConsolidate and stabilize.

The idea was big and ambitious: <strong>cast <em>communities</em> \u00a0as care providers, alongside the state and private business</strong>. We had decided to run for a 100 million dollars grant, the MacArthur's Foundation 100&amp;Change. But not as an organization. <strong>We would run as a smart swarm of grassroots initiatives around care</strong>.\n\nWe have researched \"care by communities\" in the opencare project. We fancy ourselves experts in the field. But this new task was not research: it was design. How could all those independent local initiatives combine a in a tentative system-level solution? No way this could happen through scaling grassroots initiatives. They are so fast end efficient because they mobilize local resources: skills, mutual trust, capital, institutions. They should scale as far as these resources extend, but no further. No, what we needed was an ecosystem, an organic mosaic of local solutions. We needed to think like biologists, not like engineers.\u00a0\n\nThere was only one problem: you can't design an ecosystems. Ecosystems evolve. They are so fast, efficient, diverse and beautiful precisely <em>because</em> no one agency controls them. Hell, they <em>die</em> if you try to control them too tightly. So, we did not try to design care by community at scale. Instead, we designed a context that speeds up mutation, adaptation, exchange (both cultural and economic) and selection of grassroots initiatives. The key is to hardcode incentives for them to want to interact. With no interactivity there is no ecosystem; if it does not have links, it's not a network.\n\nI hate application forms just as much as the next guy, but this one was a lot of fun. <strong>It felt right, honest</strong>. It is so strange that we could see no point in trying to bullshit the judges into selecting us. We are proposing something different, and scary, and exciting. If they go for it, better they go with their eyes wide open.\u00a0\n\nBut there is something else that makes me think we are on the right track. This: <strong>everybody hates the grant cycle</strong>. <strong>It just does not work, and it has to go</strong>. Putting money on the table attracts the sharks as well as the good guys, and the sharks have an advantage: they don't care about the problems, they only need to please the grant giver.\u00a0Grant givers know this, so they respond by putting in place rules and control systems to keep the sharks away. But of course the sharks mutate, camouflage. They go to the right conferences. They talk to funders. They pick up the exciting new concepts and ape them, turning them into hollow\u00a0buzzwords. So the grant givers erect new barriers, and so on. The result is an arms race. The losers are the doers, who need to spend more and more time differentiating themselves from the parasites. Some of them even give up, focus more and more on getting the next grant, and become parasites themselves. In the grant cycle nobody can hear you scream.\n\nThis won't happen in Open&amp;Change. For two reasons.\u00a0\n\nFirst, there is no incentive to become a parasite. If we win, we win as a swarm. MacArthur will perceive the swarm, not the single organizations. Our best path to prosperity is to avoid mission drift, use the swarm to get our initiative off the ground, and never have to chase a grant again.\u00a0\n\nSecond, we are not alone. We share the grant with hundreds of peers. They can and should be our partners, suppliers, clients, friends. <strong>The grant brings us together, instead of driving us apart in a competitive logic</strong>.\u00a0\n\nAgainst all the odds, I am quite upbeat about Open&amp;Change. It feels like we are onto something.

In addition to the Epidemological situation. </em>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\tWe need raw data about how the healthcare situation is currently being managed, but from first hand sources...ie go out and ask people on the ground. <em>How many doctors, nurses and others are currently active in caring for the new arrivals? Where are the resources coming from, is it mainly charities?

If it manages to find a subset of those bids and offers that clears, it [...] forces through the transaction [...]. Right?</em>\"\n\nRight. In our software, a clearing transaction is always forced, as people have expressed on their wishlists what they want, and these wishes are committal. (We want to automate as much as possible, avoiding the frustration of being alerted often for deals that don't happen in the end because <em>somebody</em> vetoes them.) A reputation system like eBay's indicates if a seller has delivered in previous deals (which she is obliged to even when not receiving). People use the reputation to only list wishes for items \"sold\" by trustable sellers.\n\n\"<em>It seems to me that, for a small number of users, perfect clearing is going to be next to impossible. [...] Does it have some margin (like \"force a deal when my distance from equilibrium is less than 5% of the sum at hand\")? Or does this happen over time? I see that Stanton has already\u00a0shipped the Nokia to Mark (shipping in advance has some moral hazard problems, but I guess they are nopt insurmountable).</em>\"\n\nCorrect, finding perfectly clearing trades has a low probability. We have three approaches to this problem:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Alternatives. As explained in a post above, wishlists can / should contain several alternative items for every wish. This increases the possible combinations of traded items, and thus the probability that one constitutes a validly clearing barter deal. Once participants got one of their several listed alternatives on their list in a barter deal, the other items are inactivated automatically. (Similar to \"bid groups\" in <a href=\"http://myibidder.com/\">my favorite eBay sniper</a>.)</li>\n\n<li>Same idea as yours: when the deal finder finds a set of items that fullfills every users configurable acceptable loss, it makes the deal happen; advantage for the user is getting more deals, and it's also one part of our own business model: where possible, the platform operators get items from the collected acceptable loss of others, we \"live off the trash of barter\" :D With everybody's acceptable loss at 5%, our prototype software has generated barter deals in test data networks of 15 persons, each with 5 offers and 5 wants (rough values, I don't remember exactly).</li>\n\n<li>Trading at least some infinitely dividable goods add a \"lubricant\" to barter that makes perfect clearing more probable (for example, hours of music lessons, other services, or real estate rent, all of which one would collect continually over multiple deals and use up continually). And, as in your second idea, any item can be infinitely dividable if it's about post-paid payments. When the system has some of these to incorporate into barter deals, it's enough as \"lubricant\". And some might happen, e.g. for trustable long-term customers whom you'd also let pay on invoice in monetary economy. For the buyers, post-paid is of course very attractive as they can go \"shopping\" in this system and get stuff delivered right away, not having to wait until a deal can happen. The <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/cmb/\">CMB</a> open source project is completely based on such artificial divisions, also for \"pre-paying\" with barter. But this also makes it require a dense network of P2P trust to work, so we try to avoid this by letting our algorithm do barter deals with items as a whole <em>normally</em>. Which only requires the buyer to trust delivery by the seller, and avoids credit relationships (as they happen when barter payments are dispersed over several deals). But, it makes our algorithm more complex as well: in CMB all barter deals are circular shaped (\"circular multilateral barter\"), in our system we need \"mesh trades\" / \"network barter\" (terminology is still evolving :D ).</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n\"<em>Another question: why are prices in your screenshot expressed in euro? What does that even mean?</em>\"\n\nWe rely on one function of Euro: a unit of value (and a unit that Europeans already are trained to use and accustomed to, hopefully easing voluntary adoption issues). Of course no \"real\" Euros are ever used in barter deals (neither as cash nor credit), all is settled in barter (so, products and services). Also, expressing values in Euro makes the involvement of businesses simpler (essentially, a business can barter without legal implications if it writes an invoice for its sales and gets an invoice for its purchase component of the barter deal; tax has to be paid in legal tender of course, so businesses will have to do some business in Euro alongside to pay the taxman).\n\n\"<em>FInally (could be an answer to the previous one): are you framing this as a self-sufficient \"uncurrency\" or do you see it as something existing alongside \u20ac?</em>\"\n\nWe don't intend to replace Euro, we intend to replace unemployment :) Euro will take care of itself. It will have its role, but seemingly fails to be a proper medium of exchange for enabling employment. In my understanding, that's because commodity and fiat money is necessarily scarce to be valuable \u2013 see p. 1 of the <a href=\"https://multiswap.net/doc/cmb-general.pdf\">Circular Multilateral Barter paper</a> for a more detailed explanation. But I'm not sure this is the real reason for underuse of economic resources (like worktime) in Europe's current situation. Maybe you as an economist have some insights / pointers for me to dig deeper?\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>", "created_at": "2013-04-19 23:17:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:44.380772", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1019, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [18413], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11704, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3364, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Handle with care</b>\n\nThanks, <a href=\"/u/vvorski\">@vvorski</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"/u/elf_pavlik\">@Pavlik elf</a>.

You guys start.\" And so we all keep waiting for each other. Additionally, there are complexities due to software dependency: we have enabled Mozilla Persona on Edgeryders as a gesture of goodwill (it brought exactly zero new users), but the Drupal module that manages this keeps breaking, or not keeping up with updates, so even that small gesture of goodwill becomes expensive in terms of time and cognitive load.\u00a0\n\nOpen Ethnographer \u2013 if I am right \u2013 makes sense even if no one else in the world does it. RDFa-compatible tags means more eyeballs on our data, and more competitiveness. So we do it. And once we have done it, we have built a piece of your larger vision. See?

So forgive, if things are not laid out in a language that everybody relates to. Please point out and ask if things are unclear, stated in the wrong way or need specific explanation.</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>My proposal is to combine being in transition with going into a process of exploration. I wish to focus on identifying positive aspects, letting go of unnecessary ones and building improvements or new prototypes.\u00a0</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>Getting there needs an open mind. Working offline, I use several approaches to create some space for reflection and perception. Online, I don\u2019t know yet how to provoke a role play or how to encourage you to step out of your preconceptions for a moment. Maybe <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/55073825\"><span>this video</span></a> could be an opener. If you like watch </span><span>0:00-6:25 and more.\u00a0It\u2019s only an impulse for tuning in, creating quality in listening and conversing with each other.\u00a0</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>ER is something in our hands that can contribute to a new way of working, being and spreading these approaches. It can only be done with each other not against each other. For changing the world around us, we have to start with ourselves.\u00a0</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>Now, enough prose ;) A possible itinerary could be:</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>Phase 1:\u00a0Develop and describe the process with context, principles, objectives etc. (this can be developed online - I will try to come up with the basis and some questions asap)</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>Phase 2:\u00a0Summarize and breakdown into smaller packages (maybe combined with temporary process responsibilities related to ER LBG, ER community, ER projects)</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>Phase 3:\u00a0Imagine the future within different areas (e.g. where is ER LBG, ER community, ER projects going)</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>Phase 4:\u00a0Build impact logics within different areas (looking from future/impact into what is needed to actually build it as well as identifying now-better-let go-new)</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>Phase 5: Combine and summarize findings (maybe come up with a presentation for LOTE5 and online)</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>Phase 6:\u00a0Prototype new ideas (maybe during LOTE)</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>Phase 7:\u00a0Test prototypes/new relations/new ways of doing something/etc.</span>\n\n<span>\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Phase 8:\u00a0Adjust</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>Phase 9:\u00a0Implement e.g. different set-up and new terms and conditions for ER LBG, ER community and ER projects</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>Before getting started, I have a couple more questions:</span>\n\n<span>1) Which areas do we want to explore? (e.g. ER LBG, ER community, ER projects - all of these or only some)</span>\n\n<span>2) What is set<b> </b>in these areas? (e.g. are there some legal or technical aspects that can\u2019t be or shouldn\u2019t be changed to secure functionality)</span>\n\n<span>3) How will we handle relevant discoveries? (e.g. how will we choose what to implement, can we come up with an agreement upfront or should it be decided when decisions become necessary)</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>My suggestion would be to include all areas because they are interdependent.</span>\n\n<span>Most obvious to me are the relations within AND between three different units:\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>\u2022 ER LBG within (ex and non-ex directors)\u00a0and</span>\n\n<span>between ER community and ER projects</span>\n\n<span>\u2022 ER community within (including technical operators) and</span>\n\n<span>between ER projects and ER LBG</span>\n\n<span>\u2022 ER projects within (managers and crew) and</span>\n\n<span>between ER LBG\u00a0and ER community and other ER projects</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>Plus relationships to clients and public profile.</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>I would like to link the more detailed descriptions to a pad, where I can develop next steps with you together.

Listening is inefficient, time-consuming, and tends to encourage complaining. However, this whole diversity idea is based on patiently sitting around, listen and talk and try to understand each other until we find interesting stuff to do, or solutions together. You probably heard the <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/108956256\">Bruce Sterling video</a> in support of Matera's candidacy. He talks about how it is time for the internet-style \"fake\" universality of the Open Source movement to find the aspect its missing, the local. \"OS in pursuit of the super local\", to reveal what's going on in other places, to get people involved in the process of making by making it accessible, exciting and participatory. \u00a0Reaching the \"local\" requires listening and a sensibility to what is \"there\", in order to make it interesting and graspable, not only accessible, participatory, etc. I think that is what unMonastery does (and ER does not, because it cannot it is not its function, it is a network of networks).\u00a0\n\nMarc lived in other places before where he did not get involved in any of the things that makes him so important in Matera. It was the circumstance of the unMonastery that turned him from a classic tech guy, with a passion for open source (and a resistance to DIY) with a single project, into an open and sociable educator and inventor of technology. The unMon brought a community around for all of us. The frustrating impass of the first 3 months, the impossibility to get the solar panel project off the ground was also part of it. Marc, like others, was solely focused on his project, and did not have the desire to hang out with people casually in the community. But he found himself in a situation where he could not do anything else but kind of listen and offer help with other people's projects, or go home. The \"culture\" bit is inefficient and banal but it connects the tech people to the super local, in several different ways (insisting on respect and commitment, parties, participating in local culture, etc).\u00a0\n\nI doubt it is possible to get an unMonastery going without some kind of firm statement, along the lines of \"we are here to do this\". But then it has to be brought onto the ground, to interact with the super local, so whatever arrives with the unMonastery becomes what Sterling described: accessible, participatory and gets people engrossed in the process of making (making tech, culture, objects, institutions, whatever), instead of throwing \"solutions\" at the town, like\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.unguide.net\">unGuide</a>.\u00a0I did what I said I would do, but because the process of making it was so little embedded in the community, it is now just sitting in virtual space.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-11-11 09:10:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:36.540691", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 488, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 929, "user_id": 524, "topic_id": 896, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Two weeks ago, I traveled to Strasbourg, France, to meet the <a href=\"../../stream\">Edgeryders</a> team, a new project run by the Social Cohesion Research and Development Division of the Council of Europe, with financial support from the European Commission. I am very pleased and honored to be part of this team.\n\nI'm not a European, but my vision extends to Francophonie, and beyond.\n\nI <a href=\"../../share-your-ryde/mission_case/longing-open-government-why-no-coordinated-leadership-and-sustained-com\">'shared my ryde'</a> (I told my personal and professional story) at Edgeryders, since it is through the eyes of citizens that these government agencies wish to understand what is important to European youth (and not so young people as well). From this information, the Council of Europe will seek solutions to help youth overcome adversity (particularly with regard to unemployment). Thus, this is how should be an open government: listen, show a genuine interest in what is proposed by the citizens, and use this information (the creation of knowledge) to improve public policy.\n\nAt Edgeryders, I talked about my open government dream, because this is what has concerned me for several years, enough to have spent much of my time and my energy to try to achieve this ideal. To date, no Francophone country in the world truly adopted an open government policy. None have succeeded in applying the fundamentals of this philosophy (transparency, participation and collaboration).\n\nMy opengov dreams are still alive, although what I proposed, the Open Government and Francophonie project, has not come to life yet. When something inside drives you with such intensity, nothing and no one, can destroy it. While government authorities have rejected the ideas I proposed, these ideas were not destroyed. They continue to exist somewhere in me, and in other people as well.\n\nAt Edgeryders, I shared the details of a project that does not exist yet. Maybe it will, at one point. It is not real for now, but it has gravitated inside me, and in other people, for more than a year.\n\nThese ideas are not just mine, they belong to the community.\n\nBy sharing my story at Edgeryders, I met on my way a philosopher. A special type of philosopher: an experimental philosopher. Last week, with <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/FilippiMichel\">Michel Filippi</a>, a discussion took shape, about leadership and open government models. This kind of discussion has never taken place yet in the Francophone world (and probably beyond): I was happy to see it take shape in a place like Edgeryders.\n\nMichel Filippi also <a href=\"../../share-your-ryde/mission_case/comment-je-suis-devenu-philosophe\">shared his story</a> at Edgeryders. Thus, I learned that he is good at creating relationships between things and people, he excels at making models. He pointed to an article by Karl Dubost, dating from 1999, entitled \"<a href=\"hthttp://www.la-grange.net/2009/04/28/proximite-semantique\">Semantic proximity</a>\":\n\n<blockquote>\"Let the form of action emerge, rather than model the action of the form.\"</blockquote>\n\nThis sentence has been floating in my mind for several days. I was wondering how I would shape a collective Edgeryders mission in connection with open government issues. This sentence comes to me at the perfect timing, as a gift. Thanks Michel Filippi!\n\nI invite those who have open government dreams, like me, and also those who are concerned about the future of our society, to share their story at Edgeryders, and join in discussions, missions, and campaigns, as we weave together valuable information knowledge over the upcoming months.", "created_at": "2011-11-29 17:11:34", "updated_at": "2017-09-21 13:24:45.163787", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 601, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7337, "user_id": 1421, "topic_id": 2504, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Take Part!</b>\n\nMakeSense is coming again to Stockholm!

This is in itself a major contribution to the project; and its value was further enhanced by the community rising up to provide subtitles for the video in several languages. We used a web platform called Amara, sort of a highly specialized wiki that only does translations for subtitles of videos, and does them really well. Wikis work so well because they \"packetize\" the effort needed to complete a project: you don't need to have the bigger picture, as long as you can perform the task at hand you know you are helping out. But, as I raise my gaze from the act of translating I cannot help wondering: this is something really valuable. Over maybe three weeks, we had complete subtitles in nine languages, with two more under way. Could we do this again? Could we make it into a sort of service? Did a \"translation team\" somehow emerge from the act of translating?\n\nMy tentative answer is a qualified yes. \"Qualified\" because it does not <i>feel</i> like a team. The dozen or so people that worked on this did not really talk with each other; in many case they don't even know each other. They interact by editing each other's subtitles (when they translate into the same language) and by adding value to each other's work (when they translate into different languages). But functionally speaking this does, indeed, <i>work</i> like a team. It can do so because it encodes the knowledge necessary to initiate the process and govern the tools (this is mostly in [Lucas G]'s head) and because somebody has the traction and centrality in the community to put the word out and reach people with very diverse linguistic skills (this was mainly down to [Noemi] and the official ER social media accounts). Does it make sense to make it somehow official? We could have a way to sign up for the translation team. The team would be dormant \u2013 simply a group on the platform that contains names of people who are up for doing some translation. As translation tasks come through, translators are informed, so they can take up as many (or as few) lines of text as they want. Some of these tasks would likely be paid, others \u2013 like Sam's video \u2013 would be labor of love, to be compensated through kudos and hopefully some small acts of kindness at some point.\n\nBut then, why stop at translation? An organization by teams of self-selected people agrees with Edgeryders, and with Internet collaboration a large. In a sense, it is the perfect complement of the notion of project that Edgeryders is built upon: a project is a collection of people with complementary skills organized around a goal; a team is a collection of people with similar skills organized around a class of tasks. In the kind of work Edgeryders plans to do, it might make sense to have a foresight team (people interested in futurism), an engagement team (Internet socialites who can drive signup and content resharing), an event team (people that know ho to pull off a Living On The Edge event) and so on. As people in the community lay their hands on paid <i>and meaningful</i> work, which is our main common goal here, each of us is just a few clicks away from mobilizing whole teams with great skills. This means each of us can perform as a whole company, and therefore compete with companies \u2013 and that is, indeed, the main Edgeryders vision.\n\nThe main roadblock is, as often with open networks, that it is hard to come up with an a priori way to incentivize and compensate participants. We have always insisted on explicit social contracts: \"if you do X, you can reasonably expect Y to happen\". This is hard here because compensation depends on a number of independently made decisions. <i>If people manage to bring in paid and meaningful work</i> teams are great: less entrepreneurial (but skilled) Edgeryders can augment the ability of the more entrepreneurial ones to deliver; and viceversa, the entrepreneurial folks can specialize in channeling paid work towards the skilled translators (or whatever). But this outcome depends on the balance between the two groups of people: if you end up with a lot of hired guns serving very few entrepreneurial breadwinners, the arrangement risks being exploitative for the former.\n\nI have no elegant solution save the usual one of tight expectation management and slow, organic growth. If we were to create one or more teams, I would recommend \"Join a team just to see where it goes. If you are not comfortable with the arrangement, don't join. If you do join, you need to give people the space to experiment with creating a piece of our open cnsulting ecosystem, and the permission to fail.\"\n\nWhat does everyone think?

It passed despite opposition by 96% of the supposed consultation and scores of professional statements:\u00a0<a href=\"http://lawsocietymedia.org.uk/Press.aspx?ID=1528\">The Law Society</a>,<a href=\"http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/consultations/options-dealing-squatting-response.pdf\"> The Metropolitan Police</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/consultations/options-dealing-squatting-response.pdf\">The Criminal Bar Association</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/consultations/options-dealing-squatting-response.pdf\">The Magistrates Association</a>, <a href=\"http://www.crisis.org.uk/news.php/276/crisis-condemns-criminalising-squatters\">Crisis</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://england.shelter.org.uk/professional_resources/policy_and_practice/policy_library/policy_library_folder/response_-_options_for_dealing_with_squatting\">Shelter</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/sep/25/squatting-law-media-politicians\">160 legal experts</a>\u00a0and prominent\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.redpepper.org.uk/criminalising-squatting-is-the-real-crime/\">academics</a>.\n\nResearch conducted by the <a href=\"http://www.squashcampaign.org/\">Squash Campaign</a> indicates that the criminalising squatting will cost \u00a3<a href=\"http://www.squashcampaign.org/2012/03/cost-of-new-squatting-law-could-be-790m/\">790 million over five years</a>\u00a0(even if newly criminalized squatters are not sent to jail). The government did no research of their own to justify this new law. The law was designed around the\u00a0ideological commitments of the current government and the\u00a0dramatic stories in the right winged press that often entirely misrepresented the current state of squatting law.\n\nThis new law sets the stage for the rise of authoritarian housing companies such as Camelot Security.\u00a0Camelot presents itself as a security firm, which allows it to get around giving tenants standard tenancy rights in decent accommodation. Instead, tenants (now called \u2018guardians\u2019 by Camelot) rent out flats that are the same derelict property that was once squatted.\u00a0\n\nCamelot\u2019s code of conduct for its \u2018guardians\u2019 contains serious infringements on the rights of tenants.* The code of conduct is an extraordinary authoritarian document. In exchange for the derelict flat at 80% rent, Camelot reserves the right to visit to inspect the entire property at any time to make sure guardians/tenants have no pets, parties or children, no smoking, no decorations and no candles on Camelot property. They can carry out these inspections without notice. Guardians/tenants must\u00a0\u2018behave politely to Camelot staff\u2019. Camelot can give guardians/tenants as little as 2 weeks notice to terminate contract. If a guardian/tenants wants to move out they need to give 4 weeks notice. In case of contract breach, the guardians/tenants can be evicted immediately.\n\nIs this the bleak future for the 1,000,000 empty properties in this country? Co-operative housing is a positive alternative to private security firms that force the homeless into tenancies with virtually no rights. Cooperative housing emerged in thousands of squatted properties in the 1980s and 1990s and offers a viable alternative to rising spectre of authoritarian security companies such as Camelot.\n\n* Camelot Security refers to the tenants in the flats as 'guardians' \u2013 using that convenient neo-liberal linguistic trick that dehumanises groups of people as a prelude to depriving them of basic rights, and establishing commodity relations in new spheres of existence (as when citizens are redefined as consumers).\n\n<div>Original <a href=\"https://ecolabs.posterous.com/end-of-an-era-a-brixton-case-study\">blog - A case study in Brixton, South London.\u00a0</a>\n\n</div><div>\u00a0</div><div><img alt=\"\" class=\"imagecache-Small\" src=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/sites/edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/files/imagecache/Small/untitled-1.jpg\" title=\"\"></div><div>\u00a0</div>", "created_at": "2012-04-12 10:27:27", "updated_at": "2017-09-01 04:46:05.447661", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 741, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24425, "user_id": 209, "topic_id": 4488, "post_number": 7, "raw": "Will leave this up in case anyone wants to take it on.

Because it goes to show that:\n\n1) with relatively little effort a large number of us can contribute towards producing something of value to others and to ourselves in policy contexts.\n\n2) It highlights one of the challenges of doing this where money is involved. This was a paid gig, I was originally offered 500 Euros to do the work but it would have felt weird to accept it. I accepted the contract and signed it in my name because the administrative mess of producing a large number of contracts to split 500 euros is just not feasible. Now I don't know what do do with the money, stick it into an Edgeryders paypal account or something...any ideas?\n\nSo here is the background and a little about the process...\n\nA while ago I was approached by someone from the Council of Europe asking whether we could contribute to a report they were producing in repsonse to this Parliamentary Assembly Motion about the need to come up with responded to increasing rates of self harm amongst young people in Europe: <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fassembly.coe.int%2FDocuments%2FWorkingDocs%2FDoc10%2FEDOC12256.pdf&amp;h=OAQFyNMxFAQG6vXOF5aspZd6wM3wAuyKcL7GKEa5pwZvSXg&amp;s=1\" rel=\"nofollow nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><span>http://assembly.coe.int/</span><wbr><span>Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc10/</span><wbr>EDOC12256.pdf</wbr></wbr></a>\n\nSo I set up a mission report about it here: <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fedgeryders.ppa.coe.int%2Fwhere-edgeryders-dare%2Fmission_case%2Fedge-learning&amp;h=WAQEdfbzuAQERQCAwCnHzsYtI_ZLmLw9CPFZnza9iylii7g&amp;s=1\" rel=\"nofollow nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><span>http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/</span><wbr><span>where-edgeryders-dare/</span><wbr>mission_case/edge-learning</wbr></wbr></a>\n\nWe tweeted about it both through my own and the oficial Edgeryders account.\n\nPeople started having discussions in the comments. Then Ksenia set up a google doc and more of us started contributing here: <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fdocument%2Fd%2F1LqX1mHnwvSpXwwl7akjdOxTDOqm9sOyNVsFESxyEAR8%2Fedit&amp;h=nAQENeB27AQE4CxUZgoFaEMBVE1DlvJlWme9GRWT0JmFNFA&amp;s=1\" rel=\"nofollow nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><span>https://docs.google.com/</span><wbr><span>document/d/</span><wbr><span>1LqX1mHnwvSpXwwl7akjdOxTDOqm9sO</span><wbr>yNVsFESxyEAR8/edit</wbr></wbr></wbr></a>\n\nI thought it would be nice to get more input from the internets and asked people to help get together a list of initaitives, places, projects and approaches that seem to be helping get at the underlying causes: <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fpad.telecomix.org%2Ffasjubef&amp;h=xAQEUKc82AQHThA0EFjG7pHFljA8v1TiFB2RAfyG00dnmfQ&amp;s=1\" rel=\"nofollow nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><span>http://pad.telecomix.org/</span><wbr>fasjubef</wbr></a>\n\nWhere are the contents going?\n\nThey are being included as a contribution draft report to be submitted to the committee by the \"Rapporteur\" (Ms.) Elvira Kovacs through one of her colleagues, Angela Garabagiu (see email below). But they could just as easily serve as a starting point for more discussions or be used by individual participants as a point of reference in figuring out how their projects relate to each other. But more than anything they are I would argue a useful excercise for our own thinking. How do we know what we do makes sense? How do we connect it with what others are doing? How do we make it easier for others to find us and contribute to what we are trying to achieve? These are challenges many of us are facing in our individual efforts....\n\nAnd the response:\n\n\"GARABAGIU Angela\n\n11:59 AM (3 hours ago)\n\nto me, EL-IMAM\n\nDear Nadia,\n\nThank you very much for having sent your conclusions.

I'll try to assemble some info into a really short pitch - perhaps multiple pitches.\n\nMost likely what I'll do is something like a <strong>presentation of 10-15 slides with narration</strong> of project concepts, and some more explanation in the appendix to get people who are new to the topic onto the same page.\n\nIf I get the impression we have a fighting chance to reach \"critical mass\" for some sort of project (with various ways and degrees of participation), I'll try to frame it in a more orthodox way. I'll try to shoot for something that can start small, but demonstrates potential impact, and a path to ramp it up.\n\nRegarding \"gender / other peoples perception\":\n\nI'll take one step back.\n\nIn my opinion drones are at the point where many of the non-innovative, technologically skeptical, and clueless parts of society have decided that drones <em>will</em> play a significant role in the future*. I am not sure how large this part will actually be. I think it is a pretty complex problem, but that is a story for later.\n\nNow of course some actors smell a bigger market or faster ROI than others. These are likely to push for funding and policy changes (FAA &amp; EASA), which may end up making alternative routes of development difficult or impossible. As drones have been largely developed in a military environment, this defines the perspective of many of these early players (to some degree) at least.\n\nHowever: We're about to introduce drones into many of our everyday lives - not just over the heads of an enemy army. We need to bring diverse public interests to the table. And we need to involve people into design decisions somehow. The reference to gender was because my impression has been that the female views don't seem to have a lot of traction in this. Nadia gave a good exception - but it has very few views. Here I am not talking so much about a lack of female engineers working on drones (quite a few do). I am more thinking about the global (especially: informal) economic activity that represents a large fraction of economic activity in developing nations. Also, I am thinking of female equality / empowerment / safety aspects which could be addressed more effectively if their voices were represented throughout the process.\n\n*Outside of the military.\n\nThey <em>will </em>definitely play a role on the battlefield - probably an important one. To be honest this is a field I am interested as well, because technology can often make military conflict significantly more \"humane\" or less \"humane\". And it often indirectly influences general power structures significantly over time. I think it is worthwhile to look at this - but I also think 99% of the time, 99% of the drones should be busy doing something less ambiguously beneficial. That is what I'd like to concentrate on in the context of edgeryders. If we can tap into bloated and headless defense budgets to do this (and save social budgets for other projects) it may merit a discussion.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-11 14:50:38", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:47.022414", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 554, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 1.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [19137], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18115, "user_id": 82, "topic_id": 2256, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Thanks</b>\n\n1000xThanks, [Noemi]", "created_at": "2013-12-06 10:17:30", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:41.198062", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 5, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [16804], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9475, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1506, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Why stop at one?</b>\n\nHey Ilinca, good to meet you.\n\nOh, hopefully we will generate much more than one idea per country.

There is no way we can all just sit together in community calls and troubleshoot problems one at a time. We need structure. Here's a proposal for how we might go about it.\n\n<h3>Guiding principles</h3>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>while coherent, decentralize</strong>. Many edgeryders have a thing for decentralization, because it works so damn well. The proposal goes for as much decentralization as we can get away with, while still keeping LOTE reasonably coherent. In keeping with the community's tradition, decentralizing is <em>not</em> assigning tasks and exerting supervision: the mantra is the old \"who does the work calls the shots\". In decentralizing, we forego veto power on each other. We organize to enable, not to control.</li>\n\n<li><strong>packetize and diversify tasks</strong>. Packetization opens the door for people to donate very small chunks of their time to organizing LOTE and still being useful; diversification takes advantage of the full range of talents, skills and passion within the community.</li>\n\n<li><strong>sarchastic old men don't lead</strong> unless there's absolutely no one else that will do it. Another Edgeryders tradition: older (wiser?) edgeryders like Vinay, Lucas, myself, Chris etc. agree to put in legwork but let the 20somethings and 30somethings take the lead.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Building blocks</h3>\n\nI propose an architecture made of three kinds of building blocks: sessions, tracks and services.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>A <strong>session</strong> is an atom of activity within LOTE. Generally, it requires a room; materials (post-its, maybe some more specific stuff); someone to lead it (it could be a speaker or a facilitator); participants; and documentation arrangements. Examples of sessions have been siggested already: co-design the interiors of the unMonastery (by Andrea); how to take care of each other preventing burnout (by Auli); how to win the next European Social Innovation Competition (by Matthias \u2013 well, actually I hope Matthias will propose this).</li>\n\n<li>A <strong>track</strong> is a collection of sessions united by an <strong>epic goal</strong>. These goals are the reasons that bring us together. Read on for a proposal on tracks and goals.</li>\n\n<li>A <strong>service</strong> is a LOTE-wide activity that meets some specific necessity shared by all sessions and tracks. Examples of services are: venue(s), free accommodation with local families, food, logistics, the Halloween party, social media/communication, fundraising...</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3>So, how do we organize this?</h3>\n\nApplying the principles of decentralization and packetization, I propose to refocus the energy of the community call \u2013 the only structure LOTE has right now \u2013 in recruiting volunteer coordinators to take the lead on each track and each service. Coordinators would then be responsible for making \"their\" services or track happen. In some cases, they will in turn need to recruit more people (for example, track leaders still need to fill their tracks with sessions); the community call is to help them with that as best it can.\n\nThis is a classic decentralization move. It makes it less likely that things fall through the cracks: if nobody wants to nurse a track, or work on providing a service, the track or service are simply dropped. They are not happening, and we move on to providing the tracks and services that people do want enough to put in the work.\n\n<h3>Proposed tracks</h3>\n\nIf we can quickly arrive to a list of tracks, each with a track leader, we have a high-level description of the program. This means we can explain to people what we are actually going to do at LOTE; but at the same time we leave the door open for people to propose sessions. The track level is general enough for almost anything to fit in; and yet, specific enough to trigger enthusiasm, engagement and registrations. I propose three tracks. There's nothing magic in the number three, though I think the unMonastery has three main rooms.\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>Skilling up and tooling up for greater impact.</strong> Its epic goal is: <strong>allow each participant to roll out the project as visionary, compelling and concrete as the unMonastery by the end of 2014</strong>. Sessions that would fit well in here: using Egderyders LBG as a corporate infrastructure for your project; how to best collaborate with each other online; how to sell radical projects to corporate/government folks; how to share failure and take care of each other to preserve precious brainpower from burnout.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Building the unMonastery</strong>. Its epic goal: <strong>designing together an institution to last 200 years</strong>. Sessions that would fit well in here: designing the interiors of the unMonastery; designing the clothing for the unMonasterians; working out protocols of engagement with the local community in Matera and elsewhere.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Unconference On The Edge</strong>. Its epic goal: catching up with the cutting edge stuff people within and outside the community are doing.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<h3>How to move forwards</h3>\n\nIf we more or less agree on this, the next step is to recruit, quite aggressively, for track/service coordinators. At this point, the community call becomes a place where we get each other up to speed and troubleshoot the kinks, but the real work is pushed out to the coordinators as soon as we find them.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-07-12 17:20:10", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:07.315617", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 938, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 10.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30959, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 6386, "post_number": 23, "raw": "<b>Done</b>\n\nUnpublished that comment here and moved it.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-06-22 12:59:30", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:50.351547", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 12, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [30796], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 15461, "user_id": 243, "topic_id": 1883, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>logo has been added :)</b>\n\nthe group logo has been added :)\n\n", "created_at": "2013-09-04 00:36:15", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:27.029700", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 14, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27915, "user_id": 136, "topic_id": 6123, "post_number": 10, "raw": "<b>Some answers</b>\n\nIt is really nice to find so many valuable comments here.

So, in the very beginning we had no idea, how we are going to pull it off, although we had the grand idea to have a big impact.\u00a0\u00a0We just made\u00a0a basic plan, employed different tactics on the day-to-day basis and sometimes to our own surprise, things started to get really popular. The biggest issue for the director of the big event on 7th of May was how to end it, so that the message would really be heard and at the same time so that no one would say that it was a failure. So, even a couple of days before the show, it was not clear, what will happen. For us it was pretty much a miracle that it worked out.\n\n- Estonia is a rather transparent\u00a0country, but in 2010 you could see two things happening. The political campaign costs skyrocketed and trust in politics plummeted. At that time most of the politicians had developed somewhat arrogant positions about involving public in debates and discussions. There was one guy who said that \"cultural people should be left to their own devices\" meaning that some critics should not talk about things they do not know about. So, it was a time when the feeling was that public opinion does not matter in politics any more parties try to engineer the consent just when elections come. UE was to large part a protest against this situation where many\u00a0publics seemed to have no voice.\u00a0\n\n- Why didn't we go to politics? Why didn't we use this chance to change something from inside? Estonia has a history of new parties that come and win elections, but later turn to the caricatures of themselves. Probably the issue here is that the party system without sufficient civil society changes you so much that you will forget why you entered the system. Our belief was that in order to counterbalance the system, you need to remain\u00a0outside of that. And frankly, personally we were not ready to become politicians. Add one reason - UE, starting from its name, was built as an impossible construction, we did not want to live with that.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-03-08 08:26:12", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:33.986292", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 455, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 6.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29388, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 6135, "post_number": 12, "raw": "I think we are looking here at a much more complex space, along with models of financing.\n\nFirst of all, it would be great to clarify what type of space do we open for LOTE - do we try to buy something and use the event for barn raising (at the same time skipping bargaining with host cities - the more independence we have, the better), or do we want to have a space in Brussels, ready to use as Nadia and Alberto live there already? Or both?\n\nFor me buying a land and a farm sounds most interesting - because of the costs, because of the location (out of the city, obviously well connected, but also in an underprivileged, a maybe slightly abandoned area that would use a community and an investment) and access to farming land. I was looking lately into offers in Portugal, and discussing it with one of my friends, and it's easy to find something rather cheaply - for 40, 70, 100.000 euros for a big piece of land there. Portugal is well connected by highways and has relatively many airports around. For me living in a big city in Europe is not that interesting anymore anyway:)\n\nAbout the model, it will greatly depend on the space - and vice versa. I would see it as a mix of super cheap or free accommodations\u00a0for people who work on things (fellowships, residencies), residential spaces for those who want to invest long term in it where we also cover the costs, and a business model - high-quality rooms we could rent short term, but also services. If we manage to build a community where various practices of care are available, this could be a source of revenue. We could start offering training for companies in well-being. Or open a section for a couple of elderly people, paid, but affordable.\u00a0\n\nThese ideas could build up into a de facto village we would be running there.\u00a0\n\nThe village could be at least partly financed by the crowdfunding campaign, but once we have this sorted, we should submit the very same plan to Velo foundation in Denmark that offers support in purchasing real estate for organizations. And if we connect LOTE with this land purchase, we can actually, once in a lifetime, offer a chance to buy tickets for the event with the intention that the money from the tickets (and merchandise) goes to renovation and so on. It won't be compulsory - it would be a voluntary donation, and I think many would find it reasonable.\u00a0\n\nI am only worried about the timeframe. Can we really buy a space within a couple of months? I know that Nadia is planning to go scouting, while I am preparing a list of places where there are interesting lands and farms. Or the Brussels space has to be the first step, and we will look into the purchase sometime later, once we see what works there?\n\n", "created_at": "2017-03-01 07:29:04", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:41.729859", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 511, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 6.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2201, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3553, "user_id": 2299, "topic_id": 3520, "post_number": 1, "raw": "**_Available in: :gb: [English](#en) / :ru: [Russian](#ru)_**\n\n\n----------\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/Uw60_78NFMg?rel=0\n\n## :gb: **_English version_** <a name=\"en\"></a>\n\nMy name is Masha Cheriakova. Born in Belarus, raised in the Netherlands. After finishing my Masters in Russian studies I decided to go for a new adventure and at the same time I was really motivated and enthusiastic to discover my motherland Belarus. I signed a contract with UNESCO Clubs - an NGO that advocates the humanitarian principles and ideas of UNESCO in education, science, culture and communication throughout the whole country - and started to work there as a volunteer. Soon I met many young and inspiring individuals that saw opportunities to help people that really needed their help but simply did not know how to further develop their ideas. Having had a western education as well as experience in setting up a social business, I decided to make it my mission to encourage and promote social entrepreneurship in Belarus for young change makers. Together with Denis Kondratovich, a social entrepreneur in Belarus and Nastia Khamiankova, the founder of the only start-up Hub in Belarus, we created a training program called SocStarter. SocStarter is a training program that runs every 3 months and within each cycle it trains 10 social entrepreneurial teams.  It also is a platform for social entrepreneurs who are offered tools, training and connection to likeminded people and to others that can help them. In addition to the above, SocStarter is also a competition: The 2 teams that show the best development and have the biggest potential of becoming a successful social enterprise win a business study trip to the Netherlands.  To date, we have sent 6 SocStarters to the Netherlands, where they discovered the Dutch social entrepreneurial landscape in general, and connected to entrepreneurs with business models similar their own company \u2013 you can read the report on [www.socstarter.com](www.socstarter.com).\n\nDeveloping SocStarter has been a very challenging undertaking: Social activity and entrepreneurship are considered as opposite sides of a coin by many Belarusian, as doing socially good is something you do voluntarily and entrepreneurship is there to make money/profit. Therefore the question \u2018How can you do good and earn money\u2019 came up at least once a day. Therefore SocStarter\u2019s vision is to inform and educate Belarusians about social entrepreneurship as a good solution to solve a social problem using a profit model. This enables an organization to sustain itself without being dependent on external funding.\n\nMy personal mission to help transform social ideas into social enterprises has given me the chance to meet the most incredible change makers in Belarus. It is a true joy for me to write about social innovators in Belarus and to carry their voice into the private and public sphere. I am happy Edgeryders came to Belarus and do what they do!\n\n\n\n----------\n\n##:ru: **_Russian version_** <a name=\"ru\"></a>\n\n\n\u041e\u0431\u043e \u043c\u043d\u0435, \u041c\u0430\u0448\u0435

My first \"for-next loop\" went like this: <u>for x=1 to 10; print \"Helllllo!\"; next x</u>, and I learned two things. First, it's very easy to copy digital stuff: just add an extra zero and you get 100 iterations, not 10. Second, be careful with typos, because they multiply too.\n\nWith that learnt, I went to University, where teachers would give lectures and we'd take notes. The poorer students, or those eager to work cooperatively, would painfully read their own\u00a0hand-written notes, type them using <u>a typewriter</u>, photocopy them, and sell the photocopies to most other students. (There was no competition, just a shared load. You paid nothing for your photocopies if you were a co-scribler, and not a lot if you weren't.) Thing is, the lesson notes were of very varied quality (a compound of the teachers' misunderstandings with that of the student), and for some reason they were repeated a-fresh every single year! There had to be a better way! In the second half of my studies, in came an Apple II+, but to the other students it was either a luxury or something unimaginable. So, third lesson: you need both physical resources and some (personal or absorbed) imagination.\n\nWe bought a modem (300 bps, then 1200 bps, wow), and entered the world of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FidoNet\">Fidonet</a>. (Believe me, it feels really weird to type \"Fidonet\" in google.) Meetings with others meant fun and learning, and at IRC (chat) I met my Linux friends, where I had a revelation: I had spent several hours trying to configure our printer, and I wrote a full paragraph explaining what the problem was and what I had done to try and solve it, unsuccessfully. Not 5 seconds had passed when <u>a single word</u> appeared in the chat window. It was someone from another island, and typing that comand solved my problem!\n\n", "created_at": "2012-02-22 11:28:38", "updated_at": "2017-09-20 17:21:21.972217", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 350, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1870, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1837, "post_number": 1, "raw": "As some already know, in May 2013 [AD_admin], [Matthias], [Nadia], [Noemi] and I formally founded a UK company called Edgeryders LBG. The stated aim of the company is to provide the scaffolding for the Edgeryders community to continue to exist and thrive. We care about this because we have witnessed many very valuable collaborations emerging from the community, and we believe many more are coming.\n\nAt a minimum, \u201cproviding scaffolding for the community\u201d means hosting, maintaining and further developing this website, every edgeryder\u2019s home on the web, and organizing one Living On The Edge real-life event a year. These things cost time and money; the community can and probably will provide some (time more than money), but even in the best case scenario Edgeryders LBG will be called upon to provide resources. So, here\u2019s the question: how do we generate them? In other terms: what is our business model?\n\nWe all agree on the following:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Although it is clear that Edgeryders is acting as a sort of incubator \u2013 fostering new projects and even hosting them in its corporate shell \u2013 we are <em>not</em> going to try and monetize this</strong>. We believe this service to be the most important Edgeryders has to offer, but we are still going to give it away for free. We badly want those collaborations to happen, and most of them are too fragile to demand cash of. If we were to do so, they would simply move away, or not happen at all.</li>\n\n<li>Instead, <strong>we are going to sell expert advice (we call it\u201copen consultancy\u201d to decision makers in the public and private sectors.</strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>We are going to generate this expert advice by mobilizing the community</strong>, just like we did before with the original Edgeryders exercise in 2012 and <a href=\"/t/the-edgeryders-guide-to-the-baltic/781\">Mission: Baltic</a> in 2013. Individual members of the community will be involved with different roles on different projects, according to skill and inclination; some of these roles will be paid, others will be voluntary, some will be full time, others part time.</li>\n\n<li><strong>We are going to encourage community members use Edgeryders LBG as a corporate vehicle for their projects, provided that they are coherent with our values</strong>. Both the <a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315\">unMonastery</a> and <a href=\"/economy-app\">Economy App</a> are initially framed within the Edgeryders corporate shell. As they grow, these projects will probably want to spawn their own corporate entities, but starting within Edgeryders relieves them of some administrative complexity early in the game, when the people leading them need to focus getting the projects off the ground. If you have a project you want to do as Edgeryders and can get the resources to get it off the ground, we\u2019ll hire you as a project manager, give you an email address and a deck of business cards, and help you as best we can (<a href=\"/t/edgeryders-as-social-enterprise-what-you-can-do-with-it/1044\">more on this</a>).</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nHow exactly to do that? We prefer to spend our time trying things out rather than making slides for a business plan \u2013 we got our first client before even becoming incorporated, and are currently engaged in pitching both Edgeryders to possible clients in three continents. And yet, the discussion on business models is relevant and interesting, and it has started. So far, we have identified three entities that feel somewhat similar to Edgeryders, and from which we might learn.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://www.primaryinsight.com\">Primary Insight</a> is a consultancy company that delivers investment advice. Its benchmark competitor is Gartner. Instead of trying to hire the best analysts, PI deploys ad-hoc networks of people who are not professional consultants, but rather people who work in the relevant industries and contribute to PI on the side. For example, is a client is thinking about buying machine tools companies in China, PI builds a team consisting of people who work in the machine tools industry, have a deep knowledge of the Chinese manufacturing space, or both. PI insists that, by being embedded in the industries clients need to know about their consultants, their consultants can deliver much better intelligence than any external (and generalist) analyst. PI is \u201clike Edgeryders\u201d because it is connected to people on the ground, <em>whatever the ground</em>, and can mobilize these people to deliver expert advice. Such advice takes the form of projects like Mission: Baltic or the Edgeryders Guide to the Future: a fairly large-scale coordinated effort around a goal agreed with an individual client.</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://www.expertlabs.org/\">Expert Labs</a> is presented (by David Weinberger, in a recent book) as a public sector equivalent to Primary Insight. Its initiator is a friend, and a person I look up to: Beth Noveck, onetime director of the White House\u2019s open government initiative. Apparently, the initial idea was to redeploy the vast expertise contained in an existing organization called the American Association for the Advancement of Science. At the time of writing, Expert Labs <a href=\"http://techpresident.com/news/21987/expert-labs-crowdsourcing-policy-and-thinkup-look-back\">seems to have folded</a>, after focusing much of its efforts on building an ICT tool, called ThinkUp, for government agencies to continuously engage citizens on social media to tap into their collective intelligence.</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://redmonk.com/about/\">Redmonk</a> does not do \u201cclient work\u201d other than one-on-one consultant\u2019s billable hour. So, no projects like Mission:Baltic happen as a result of client asking for them. Rather, Redmonk does research as it sees fit, and then publishes its results. Its revenue comes from a subscription model \u2013 not unlike a magazine. Like a magazine, it has a lot of freedom. Expert advice takes the form of projects like in the Primary Insight example, except that their goal is determined only by Redmonk, and consumed by all of its clients/subcribers. Redmonk is \u201clike Edgeryders\u201d because they claim to be able to act as go-between clients and a particular category of people: for them it is developers (\u201cthey are our people\u201d, as their corporate website puts it). What would be the equivalent of Redmonk\u2019s developers for Edgeryders? Young people? Radicals? Social innovators?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nDo you like any of these models? Do you think they would work for Edgeryders? Do you have any other ideas?\n\n", "created_at": "2013-08-06 07:00:16", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:07.584558", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1107, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 71.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25130, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5967, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Cool!</b>\n\nGreat, @Franca .

The City Administration regulated the matter for new buildings as well as existing ones. The latter faced a variety of unforeseen problems that resulted into a 10% compliance rate in 15 months since the law passed. In the common understanding, this means a public effort not hitting the target, a cracked relationship between the City Administration and private businesses and ultimately disadvantaged people still vulnerable.\n\nThe story begins in 2015 with the City of Milan to pass the Building Regulation article 77 that required all bars, shops, restaurants and craft activities bordering the road, to provide easy access to people with limited mobility or disabilities (the National Institute of Statistic in 2007 assessed <a href=\"http://www.cittametropolitana.mi.it/export/sites/default/affari_sociali/Allegati/ops_approfondimento_disabili.pdf\">13.189</a> people with mobility disabilities in Milan). This normative action was the instrument that City of Milan deployed to overcome architectural barriers and provide universal free access to public places by 2017.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/58083ff648a85e43b50005639a3eec99cb030be0.jpg\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\">\n\nIn November 2016, 12 month after the law passed the City of Milan assessed only 2.000 businesses compliant over 18.000. An article on <a href=\"http://milano.repubblica.it/cronaca/2017/01/05/news/milano_negozi_barriere_architettoniche-155417926/?ref=search\">la Repubblica</a>, the second most read Italian newspaper, by the 5 January 2017, published these data and opened a public discussion on the subject.\n\nLisa Noja (delegate of the Major for accessibility policies) said: <i>We have to make sure that very quickly all businesses comply. This year we want to get to the full application of a rule of civilization and to do that you cannot only use repressive strategies.</i>\n\nIt was a beginning of a twist in the Municipal strategy and the start of a speculation about the most effective way to enforce a regulation. The new thinking included working with trade associations, like Confcommercio, as well as promoting campaigns to engage business holders.\n\nCristina Tajani (City Councillor for labour policies, businesses, trade and human resources) said: <i>places that show attention to the disabled are also easily accessible to children, parents with strollers and the elderly. This does not mean that they will not be submitted to controls, but we want help the business understand that the adjustment should not only be seen as an obligation. It is also a business opportunity.</i>\n\nThis is when OpenCare approach came handy. Local staff including WeMake was involved and started talking to as many people as possible, to understand what was not working and tentatively get it streight.\n\n<b>Listening\u00a0</b>it was vital to start from the pieces of the City Administration that were involved from the beginning like the Major Cabinet, the Urbanistic Department, the Public Soil Occupation Office and lately Urban Economy and Work department. We have understood that the building legislation was conceived in a department and the implementing regulation was written in a different one (and of course published through another one). That gave a lot of room to officers for interpretations and tightening the instructions for businesses to prevent opportunistic behaviors. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n<b>Including</b> as the collaboration with the trade association got closed we\u2019ve understood more of the problems that businesses are facing to comply with the regulation, such as: high costs, complex red tape, lack of understanding of the most suitable solution and existing solutions too standardized. Since red tape is partially due to complex <a href=\"http://www.comune.milano.it/wps/portal/ist/it/servizi/tributi/occupazione_suolo_pubblico/abbattimento_barriere_ingressi_accessibili\">implementing regulations</a> and the unclear communication follows, we started facilitating a mutual dialogue between pieces of public administration, businesses and associations. Regarding costs and production related problems, we can take it into the arena of manufacturing 4.0 by including also designers, makers, social innovators, businesses and utilizers.\n\n<b>Going where innovation beats</b>\u00a0we have started organizing an experimentation called Open Rampe (Rampe means Ramps/Slides) in a limited area of the city that has everything it takes. The <em>Quartiere Isola</em> in fact has a functioning District for Urban Commerce, a civic center devoted to urban regeneration, art and crafts workshops (<a href=\"http://www.lastecca.org/\">ADA stecca</a>), active businesses and a long tradition of civic participation. Our idea is to engage business individually and through a public event by 11th April. Involving them into\u00a0co-design sessions pivoting around their necessities may generate unexpected outcomes.\n\n<b>Dealing with collective intelligence\u00a0</b>is what we have just started doing by sharing this story here. Any input from the community could be brought into our experimentation and add value to it. It would be interesting to study this collaboration as it happens and share it.\n\nThis is where we stand now and the next steps are:\n\n<b>Co-designing / mobilizing resources\u00a0</b>of course we will not predefine outputs, but rather keep the sessions open to any outcomes.\n\n<b>Prototyping policies\u00a0</b>by monitoring and evaluating this experimentation.\n\nWe are aware that talking about \u201cenforcing\u201d a policy collaboratively may sounds an oxymoron. Since article 77 of the building regulation fits in the EU and the National legal frameworks, it is certainly a top down process.\u00a0Nevertheless, the Open care approach might help policy makers, (non)compliant businesses, users and citizens to achieve simpler, cheaper and faster solutions.\n\nIt would be interesting to know who else has been involved in a similar process and managed it collaboratively. Or not.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-03-23 16:58:00", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 05:10:44.777753", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 996, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 93.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32710, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 3701, "post_number": 28, "raw": "<b>Making the evening program centred around food and</b>\n\nintense experiences.

This a pretty long post, but let us know what you think works or not.\n\nSo to start we felt social media's strength is in its ability to engage users to participate or leave their mark in a simple and quick way. Virility is based on how interested users are in the subject. Knowing this, can we design a campaign that brings together a global community around the common unMonastery cause while giving them attractive content to share amongst their friends?\n\nThere is also an opportunity to using this voting period also as a way of understanding the community that is supporting unMonastary, as a way of uncovering their motivations, and then taking and understanding these motivations to build upon future campaigns. This might make the campaign more enganging than just voting.\n\nAn interesting avenue could be to create an integrated social media campaign using Facebook, twitter, pintrest. Facebook is a powerful platform to spread content, such as videos and images. Twitter allows for a strong virility around voting itself, allow us to spread a singular message that each user can than adapt in their own way. Pintrest gives you the access to an underground social innovation following, and can be a way to create fun content like d.i.y solutions that are related to the areas of interest of the EdgeRyders. The plan could be deployed in a few steps\n\nStage 1: Activate the users that already know and are passionate about the project to vote for unMonastery and to start a hashtag that will hopefully catch on with future voters. Having those who are participating in the project reach out to their friends as a primary first level voters. This can be spread through twitter using a hashtags such as \\#voteunMonastery.Another interesting hashtag you can play with is \\#oraelavora or \\#timetowork in english. This hashtag is a wordplay on the motto of the benedict monastery ora et labora.\n\nSo as we ask people to vote for the project we can get them to also post on Twitter and Facebook that they voted and why they voted. An example could be\n\n\" \\#voteunMonastery because we need new systems of citizen engagement \"\n\nWe can also ask users to draw their vision of a new world take a picture on their phone and upload it the \\#voteunMonastery\n\nStage 2: Is to start to create content that can be shared centrally through a pintrest, Twitter and Facebook pages of unMonastary that is easy for people to share, to their friends.\n\nExamples could be:\n\nA. create a short video series (2 mins or less) under the name of unStories to promote each initiative in \u00a0\u00a0 the project.\n\n\u00a0#1 UnStories. Solar pannel.\n\n\u00a0#2 UnStories. Urban gardening\n\n\u00a0#3 UnStories. Wii Networks\n\n\u00a0ecc..\n\nB. Create D.I.Y image tutorials that can be posted on twitter similar to this: http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/236x/3f/6e/e6/3f6ee6f91ebfde236e17c226cc7f8a97.jpg . This is only an example but you get the idea that you can make interesting tutorials on a number of subjects the Edgeryders are knowledgeable in and this content can spread and help direct traffic to voting for unMonastary.\n\nStage 3: Can be creating custom profile / cover images for others to use on their profile pages that are centered around voting for unMonastery.\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\n", "created_at": "2014-01-20 15:56:46", "updated_at": "2018-06-03 01:58:47.990115", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 616, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8388, "user_id": 3613, "topic_id": 6406, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>thanks !</b>\n\nThanks @WinniePoncelet...

Among the youngest of us, when we're activists in our teens and 20's, we don't take this stuff seriously. I continuously remind my younger clients that it's a LONG GAME, this life thing. Small nagging injuries need to be addressed. Learning to focus and quiet the mind among those of us who tend towards distraction and manic thinking needs to be addressed. In answer to your question, I think one tactic is to actively invite/welcome the people who focus on individual sustainability-- body, health, breath, balance...-- into our midst. They often share our values but are focused on individual as opposed to social/global transformation. I am so lucky to have discovered a meditative/body practice and its community in hooping (hula-hooping. don't laugh. it's true.) which has led to my knowing dancers, physical therapists/bodyworkers, yogis-- whose teachings have been *invaluable* for sustaining me.\u00a0</span></span></span>\"</em>\n\nI would love to follow up the sessions\u00a0with a reflection on how we can make better use of our online behaviours\u00a0to prompt us to take better care of ourselves, one another\u00a0and people in our extended social networks.

If you missed parts of it, you can now glimpse through this summary. I recommend reading the original pieces, the quality of all contributions is very high. Thank you Dougald, Christopher, Nadia, Alek, Natalia, Petros, Noel, Bridget, Arin, Eimhin, Andrei and those of you reacting on twitter.\n\n<strong>Edgeryders and Global Challenge welcome more contributions. A limited number of commentators will be rewarded with a paid ticket to the upcoming workshop in <a href=\"/t/you-the-expert-an-invitation-to-stockholm/959\">Stockholm</a> (March 15th) where they can prepare an extended version of their contributions and possibly publish them in a book.</strong>\n\nWe can agree by now that youth unemployment is complex and is not isolated in economic workings, even when the concept of \u201cwork\u201d remains dominant of our conception of <a href=\"/t/innovation-and-work/1012\">existence</a>. So to really understand it we need to look at broader dynamic contexts, and while we wait for prescribed, conventional, magical solutions we are paying more attention to where young and not so young people choose to put in their time and talent, and what makes sense for them. \u00a0\n\nIn his post, <a href=\"/blog/the-regeneration-of-meaning\">Dougald</a> looks at the search for meaning of participators in the social and economic lives of their societies. Irrespective of how we make a living, it comes down to how satisfied we are with the answers we give ourselves to all three questions below. When answers become obsolete, human beings can break, no matter if they\u2019re working middle aged men with relative financial security or young graduates with no security at all.\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>Economic/Practical</strong>: How do I pay the rent?</li>\n\n<li><strong>Social/Psychological</strong>: Who am I in the eyes of others?</li>\n\n<li><strong>Directional</strong>: What do I get out of bed for in the morning? And where do I see myself in the future?</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nWe know that ways to go about and meet those needs are not the same for today\u2019s younger generations as they were for their parents, starting with the clear fact that there is no \u201cworkforce to enter\u201d, so one immediately gets stuck at the first one. Even with a conventional job, the financial rewards and social recognition are misallocated, in that most often people doing the hardest or more valuable work to society are those at the bottom of the ladder. What\u2019s needed, in the words of <a href=\"/t/innovation-and-work/1012\">Christopher</a>, is to radically rethink the chain: \u201cyou need an education, in order to get a job, and then be able to feed yourself, house yourself, and have value in the eyes of others\u201d.\n\nIn the face of very poor deals that the \u201cunemployed\u201d or the \u201cprecariat\u201d are given (deeply\u00a0flawed mental categories we use), all authors at Edgeryders look at islands of change, examples of \u201csubstituting for employment\u201d to derive a sense of social identity and meet practical needs. For some like Petros, the most important thing is to find meaning in your life, and things have their own ways once you arrive at that.\n\nThese unconventional solutions are plenty and we\u2019re looking to continuously update the list.. <a href=\"http://www.context.org/iclib/ic37/bergmann/\">Center for New Work</a> with rotating work schedules instead of letting people off, <a href=\"http://www.access-space.org/doku.php\">Access Space</a>, the UK\u2019s longest-running free internet learning centre, <a href=\"http://westnorwoodfeast.com/about\">West Norwood Feast</a> with its community-owned and -run street market, <a href=\"http://music.stevelawson.net/\">Steve Lawson</a> selling downloads of his albums on a pay-as-you-want basis, the <a href=\"http://unmonastery.eu/\">unMonastery</a> as intentional community and intermediary between local institutions and community needs, campaigning to protect urban spaces, like the <a href=\"http://www.startnext.de/en/prinzessinnengarten\">Prinzessinnengarten</a> in Berlin, \u00a0<a href=\"http://www.stockholmsfria.nu/artikel/79607\">building homes for the homeless</a>\u00a0in Stockholm\u00a0in disused spaces, <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/mine-becomes-ours/mission_case/freelab-laboratory-freedom\">Freelab in rural Poland</a> educating local community in hemp growing or building rocket stoves, the decentralized commons production models..\u00a0 In post-Soviet countries and probably in post-communist as well, a hackers\u2019 and do-it-yourself culture is already in place or getting reactivated easier, as <a href=\"/t/a-free-culture-for-jobs-and-employment/1014\">Alek</a> suggests. Back in the days people had learned to get around, cater for themselves and others to cope with everyday life hardships.\n\nWhere is the role of the state in all this? Some believe that when economic, social and cultural institutions fail, the necessity is to build parallel institutions in the form of alternative social systems (see Vaclav Benda\u2019s Parallel Polis), with new ways of acting and being. But a point that\u2019s been made is that this sort of innovation needs more leverage to go past an intellectual alternative;\u00a0what we need is to leverage the state, that these alternative systems can\u2019t really replace the minimum security provided by (at least) European states, and its large machinery that regulates exchanges or redistributes wealth. Also, what happens if none of the radical solutions are large scale response that can touch that 50% youth unemployment?\n\nAnother big question mark remains as to what would happen when two parallel, fundamentally different systems are in place, and their interest groups may need to cooperate or confront for the use of resources and their dependency on one <a href=\"/t/the-regeneration-of-meaning/2011/3\">another</a>. For Eimhin, the solution is somewhere in between these two groups, because we are actually seeing a bigger cultural shift, fostered by intermediaries and a \u201c<a href=\"/t/the-regeneration-of-meaning/2011/7\">decisive technology</a>\u201d. The question is how to better support this future-building exercise, as opposed to growing less tolerant of our radical innovators.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-02-14 10:21:34", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:01.261697", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1098, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1048, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1015, "post_number": 1, "raw": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/KKrM2c-ww_k?list=FLe9lSnHJnRk8DvrRZvvtW8Q\n\nYes, I know, it seems preposterous. And yet, the more I turn it around in my head, the more it makes sense. A few months ago I presented at TEDx Bologna, and used the opportunity to try and stitch together the pieces of my intellectual journey of the past five-six years around this issue.\n\nThe result was the video above. In a nutshell: collective intelligence is the most promising weapon we have to face the many dire problems threatening our species, and that transcend the individual scale. Climate change, feral finance, mounting inequalities; we can't touch these (and others), because <i>they don't exist at the same scale as us</i> \u2013 they emerge from the interaction of billions of us. To address these problems, it seems intuitive that we should deploy an equally emergent, same-level collective intelligence. Unfortunately, representative democracy is concocted in such a way that does not allow the emergence of solutions (in the sense that Wikipedia is an emergent solution to the problem of writing an encyclopedia) within democratic institutions. Participatory democracy could, in theory, lead to such a result, but it does not scale. To make it scale we can use the Internet. First, we design online interaction environments from which we think collective solutions might emerge; then we measure the social dynamics the these environments host and foster, as if they were coral reefs colonized by many species. I wrote \"measure\" because, thanks to network analysis, social interaction dynamics have become measurable, even for large communities.\n\nMaybe, using these techniques, we'll finally be able to make the dream of a working, large-scale participatory democracy come true. We have held on to it for twenty-five centuries! It's certainly worth trying. And in the mean time, I would certainly like to try it on the new Edgeryders, just as it has been tried on Edgeryder 1 (see Ben and Gaia's full report <a href=\"http://edgeryders.wikispiral.org/help-build-june-conference/mission_case/edgeryders-social-network-analysis-fullreport\">here</a>).\n\n", "created_at": "2013-02-13 13:48:48", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:04.480578", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 369, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18189, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 2259, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Agree with Nadia</b>\n\nThis was supposed to be my next point, that if Edgeryders will be running the show and if commitment is required from community members it'd be more than necessary to know where the commitment is going and what we'd be doing with a successful result.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-01-08 10:07:05", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:41.577171", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 58, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [17078], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18747, "user_id": 31, "topic_id": 1539, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>OCO!</b>\n\nOrganised Chaos Office!\n\nWhat a _great_ idea, Alberto ...\n\nAs part of my work for \"a bad one\", I've looked into OODA and SCIM. Let me tell you about them briefly and then you all help me look at the limitations and how to close those gaps? Please?\n\nOk, SCIM. Simple Critical Infrastructure Maps. That's Vinay Gupta's tool for modelling a crisis situation. You look at needs, not systems, because some systems are broken. So, homes have been turned into debris by the earthquake, but you still need protection from the weather.\n\nVinay has identified 18 essential needs, starting with those of the individual. This is a \"hard resiliency\" approach, so only \"death\" is accounted for. For individuals, death in a crisis can come from - sing along with me - \"too hot, too cold, hunger, thirst, disease (inside the skin) and injury (breaks the skin)\".\n\nGroups need what individuals need, plus transport, communication, workplace and resource-control (usually carried out as simple sharing, as with the wi-fi superb example). Organisations need what the previous levels need, plus shared maps, plans and succession. Each state is basically a bunch of organisations.\n\nSo it's a fast-scan tool, to look at what has been broken by the crisis, in order to prioritise real fast.\n\nThen, each \"need\" is solved by looking at \"levels and substitutions\". Say water came from the tap and the tap is broken? You can bring in water in trucks. Phone lines are cut? Use walkie-talkies, satellite phones or whatever. Extreme weather has killed your local food? Import it from the international level. Conflict has killed the boats that brought your food? Grow your own food.\n\nOODA, which stands for Observe, Orient, Decide, Act, is John Boyd's \"loop tool\" to quickly gather data about what's going on, look at implications and values etc, decide what to do next, do it, and back to observation.\n\nSo, can we imagine this kind of _extremely flexible_ approach being used by the hard-headed commanders in \"civil protection\"? I have no problem. Just as we can learn somewhat rigid tools to, guess what, produce creative ideas. Or just like silicon computers have random-number generators.\n\nI'm betting it can be done.\n\nNow ... the limitations.\n\nThis is a \"hard resilience\" approach.\n\nWhat about \"feelings\", good and bad? What about hope? Wait - do firemen deal with that? No. But others do.\n\nWhat about \"governance\", \"voluntary cooperation\", or whatever we want to call it? I don't know, and it's _not_ in the SCIM/OODA tools. Each person or group or organisation or state (each of them an _agent_ in the crisis) can use the tools, make up their mind about what's broken and some alternatives for solving it, and get going. Conversations among said agents can use the language to cooperate.\n\nNow, this hasn't been tested. And probably many elements of that are being used already by \"civil protection\" guys all over the place, so it will be recognised by them really fast.\n\nThis brings me back to your (Alberto's) point: Organised Chaos Office. Maybe there's need for such an office. But if it doesn't exist ... what can citizens do? I hope SCIM-OODA tools (with the improvements and deletions brought in by experience) [I mean SCIM-OODA _or better_, as usual, not saying this is the end-all of this matters, of course not] might help.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-30 15:18:48", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:44.569148", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 612, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [11738], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12105, "user_id": 1933, "topic_id": 2525, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Hi Noemi, thanks for welcoming me here! :)\n\nYes I have links to some of the projects I took part in or co-organized, here are some of them:\n\nhttp://www.dw.de/%C3%B6kotopia-experiment-f%C3%BCr-eine-bessere-zukunft/a-5930608 \u00a0 \u00a0<span>this link is in German, it is about an annual environmental conference to which I brought groups of Armenian young people two times in the frame of EU Youth Program a few years ago, and the connections made during the conference later on helped to develop a good environmental activist atmosphere which later became a part of an environmental movement in Armenia, and it's growing.</span>\n\nhttp://www.cultural.am/hy/norutyunner/lurer/nor-mshakutayin-tarr-mer-qsghaqum \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This one is an article in Armenian about a cycling action called \"Tie and Wind\"\u00a0:) but at least in the pictures it is visible what makes this cycling action unique - we cycle in more or less official clothing in order to promote the idea of cycling not only as an alternative for environmentally conscious people but also as a lifestyle that can be for everybody, including people who have to wear official cloths due to job requirements. This action was initiated by me and a few friends in 2013 and is becoming more and more known among the cyclist community in Yerevan.\u00a0\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk2Yy_80wDg&amp;list=UU_vL5J8oU3G9HOX9lqRqSXA&amp;index=5 \u00a0 \u00a0Here I am sharing the video I made about a nice cultural initiative that took part in Germany in 2011 - Artsummer Wiesenburg. The idea was to get together and share ideas and experiences about upcycling and to create upcycled art together. As an outcome of this we later participated to other upcycling events in Germany and Latvia, multiplying the learned knowledge and gained experiences to wider public and opening it all up for the Armenian young people who took part in the project in Latvia called \"Give a Chance to Upcycling\"\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZulcPp6h1Ak&amp;list=UU_vL5J8oU3G9HOX9lqRqSXA\n\nThis is a video I made in the frame of a professional development project in New York city in 2007, when I was experimenting on alternative ways of communication and using creative means of self-expression for voicing out deep societal issues and speaking out for human rights. The project was called Artquake and is being implemented in different forms continuously during my travels and collaborative actions with like-minded people around the world.\n\nThere is really a lot more to share, but not to make it too long, I'd just like to reflect on the impact that this kind of ideas and actions had and keep having on the minds of people in Yerevan, when being implemented locally. One of the first I would mention the \"Tie and Wind\" action which is something like a small scale critical mass that aims to attract people towards cycling not by just talking about the benefits of cycling, but also by showing that cycling can be stilish and eyecatching and fun:) This is an approach that helps to get more attention and works as a good advertising tool by itself. It is also a logical continuation of the traditional critical masses that are being regularly organized in Armenia, and evrry time there are more participants, which shows that the people start liking and getting really into it.\n\nSo, answering your question about measuring the impact - yes, there is a way, and it can be for example the amount of smiles we get when cycling in suits, or the statistical numbers of bicycles sold in Armenia annually (within a few years the numbers jumped up from a few dozens a year to about 15000 a year by the end of 2013!) Public authorities also got really enthusiastic and as a proof of it - I have a meeting with the vice-mayor of Yerevan, the representative of transport department of municipal office and a representative of the city police department this Thursday at 17:00 in Yerevan, to talk about the final cycling route plan of the center of Yerevan. Things start moving and it inspires even more:) I suspect that by the end of spring we may have a few cycling paths in Yerevan - the first functinal ones.\n\nI think this is a good start and should be multiplied to more networks so we plan to implement more creative actions to reach a bigger number of cyclists in Armenia and to be able to demand better cycling infrastructures in the country. And this is just about cycling, but there are other fields that we are active in and when I say we I mean a few hundreds of people who keep moving towards realization of ideas that earlier sounded either impossible or very hard, and now they are becoming real day by day.\n\n<span>I like the task of mobilizing youth for social and cultural causes in Armenia, because even if from the first glance the youth in Armenia seems to be inactive, when you inspire them, unbelievable things start happening, and this is really interesting for me. \u00a0Facebook and other social networks are really active in Armenia, much more than in many other countries that I visited. I am still trying to understand why:) But I kind of like it because it helps to reach out people. And at the same time I have some preference for real meetups, face to face communication, tea evenings (teavenings:) , cinema nights, cycling events and picnicks etc, because that is when a more real connection can be made and real inspirations can be generated. \u00a0\u00a0</span>\n\nBy the way, are you I am mainly based in Yerevan / mountains nearby, but this year I plan some travels, mainly around Berlin, probably Sankt Petersburg, Portugal, Ukraine, Sweden etc. In the coming months I will be 50/50 in Armenia and outside, but since a lot of interesting things are happening spontanously, I don't like planning too much, I leave some chance for being flexible in plans and I am freelancer, so quite free to decide where to be and what to do.\n\nWow, this was a long session of not only sharing but also self-reflection.

There is one exception from the no-credit rule: worktime is settled in several transactions, so can be considered a kind of \"credit\". However not more than the unpaid chunk of worktime between start of work and payment of an invoice can be considered a \"credit\" in monetary economy. As people are used to that, we think it's not a problem for voluntary adoption. (Side note: I don't understad how credit clearing is a problem with critical mass, since in such a system new credit can also be added when new transactions are recorded. Essentially as done in <a href=\"https://ripple.com/\">Ripple</a>.)\n\nSo yes, the above graph represents a \"trading circle\" that matches offer and demand of products and services: every arrow path between two users (circles) represents a \"sale\". The graph is a subset out of a much larger order graph that also contains the not yet fulfilled orders, and is now diminished by the orders executed in the graph shown above. You say, it creates the problem of precise prior product definition. That is true, esp. since product returns are not easily possible in a network barter economy. However, the problem is just the same as for example in webshops and on eBay: sellers describe their own products. We, the platform, do not create \"standardized\" product definitions because there are simply so many different ones around. It would work for bulk goods (as done by <a href=\"http://openbarter.org/\">openBarter</a>) and things with an EAN / ISBN (as done on Amazon), and we might add that later as it offers some advantages for the barter algorithm.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-01-08 13:56:05", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:28.998611", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 331, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 10.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [26007], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27637, "user_id": 1457, "topic_id": 2051, "post_number": 33, "raw": "<b>in Italian, is it right? how does it sound better in a postcard?</b>\n\n<strong>dal 30 Ottobre a 3 Novembre\u00a0</strong>\n\nor just something like : \u00a0\u00a0\n\n<strong>30 Ottobre &gt;\u00a03 Novembre</strong>\n\n", "created_at": "2013-10-17 11:53:08", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:32.554271", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 44, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [27636], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5706, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5673, "post_number": 1, "raw": "We have discussed this, @markomanka\n\nhttps://www.healthbank.coop/faq/\n\n", "created_at": "2016-06-06 14:21:00", "updated_at": "2018-05-26 05:17:21.308622", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 14, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17436, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 1991, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Don't have it</b>\n\nYou're very welcome.

We'd also be happy to get ideas for collaboration with other Edgeryders-related projects to enhance this application. Thanks everyone! --@matthias_\n\n\n## 1. How it Works\n\nWe propose a collection of organizational and ICT infrastructure that empowers small-scale food producers to sell on the European Single Market. Specifically, we want to create: (1) a pan-European network of small-scale food producers, all represented on (2) an Internet food shopping portal that includes \u201cautomagic\u201d human translation of product descriptions into European languages. The network consisting of (3) regional groups (\u201ccells\u201d) of at least 10 food producers each, which offer (4) collection of goods and and their combined shipment to other cells of the network throughout Europe, which then act as logistics hubs for distribution to end customers. Combined shipment can use large parcels or even pallets, making it economically possible in contrast to international shipment of individual small orders of products with a low price-to-volume ratio such as food.\n\nThis system will then be joined with our existing food-shopping platform for small-scale producers at www.epelia.com. Like now, the operators of this platform take on the task of ensuring adequate visibility of the offered products on target markets, and are compensated with a 4% commission fee on sales. The low fee, together with a future cooperative based legal structure, is designed to ensure that this idea can grow into a movement rather than being exploited for private gain.\n\n\n## 2. How it Helps\n\nCurrently, access to the European Single Market is very limited for small-scale food producers: a majority of them is located in Southern and Eastern Europe, where sales on their domestic market mostly have declined since 2008, where the logistics infrastructure connecting them to \u201cricher\u201d Northern European markets is often detrimental (parcel service costs, trucking service costs etc.). Also, richer Northern European food markets, esp. the German one, are dominated by oligopolistic structures: a few large food store chains which simply do not bother to buy from small-scale producers, while the remaining institutional clients mostly do not order enough of one item at once to make an international shipment economically viable.\n\nNow how does this scheme of empowering small-scale producers to access European markets create new jobs, given that it competes on the food market, which is inherently limited in growth? It creates jobs (and secures existing ones) by diverting the food market's revenue away from big business, where it would only end up as shareholder value and from there in ever more ROI-maximizing \u201cinvestments\u201d (which today means more often than not, speculation). Instead, by intentionally cutting out all middlemen, the food market revenue ends up directly at the small-scale manufacturers, and then mostly as salary at its workers. And because small-scale manufacturing is less efficient than the highly automated, industrial variant, more jobs are created than lost on the side of big business with which this scheme competes.\n\nAnd, a \u201cless efficient\u201d job does not mean lower income, also not lower competitiveness: for example, we found that food from small manufacturers in Calabria, Southern Italy, has an exceptional quality, and at a price level that is very low for German standards. This price level can be kept in our scheme, by avoiding any intermediate merchants in the chain of commerce. Also, while big business might be efficient in terms of automated production, but is quite inefficient in terms of waste: as much as 30% of food is wasted at various points of the supply chain before it is eaten. Small business in a system of direct sale to consumers is better at this, since no food will rot in stock or store this way. And finally, even if the created jobs are still less efficient, they are more enjoyable because being located in smaller, human scale, more familiar work settings. So they should fare better than big industry jobs in an index of wellbeing that includes not only GDP but also indicators of human satisfaction and happiness.\n\n\n## 3. How it's Innovative\n\nThe idea of combined shipments is not new: it has recently been launched by San Francisco based startup Good Eggs (goodeggs.com) in city scale. And in a logical sense, trucking service providers also do this by combining pallets into truckloads, while we combine parcels into pallets. However, to our knowledge no continent-wide system for combined shipment of parcels exists currently, and also not the cell-based regional infrastructure we invented for its deployment.\n\nHowever, combined shipment alone is not a recipe for jobs in small-scale manufacturing: it is essential to forward the savings from this to the manufacturers, and also to take advantage of direct shipping by adding direct marketing, cutting out the middlemen. While Good Eggs seems not to do this, and trucking companies certainly don't, we ensure doing so by giving the enterprise a cooperative structure, thus protecting it from hostile takeovers.\n\n\n## 4. Deployment Strategy\n\nRight now, we operate the German food shopping portal epelia.com (existing since 2009), with about 150 small-scale food producers selling there. We want to reuse it as the German marketing and sales channel for the international sellers which are added by deploying the concept propose.\n\nFor deployment of a combined shipment system, there is obviously the problem of critical mass: you need enough products exported from the same spot to be combined into pallet shipments at least every week. We will work around this issue with the idea of regional cells: this way, we will only need two regions for a start, which can trade food back and forth, and establish a critical mass of 10 or more food producers in both. The system can then grow by adding one region at a time.\n\nAt first we want to focus on Southern Italy (Calabria, Puglia and Basilicata) as regions to find small-scale producers for our system. We have already visited a trade fair in Catanzaro and met with vivid interest in the idea. Later we will gradually extended to other regions, first including Romania and Bulgaria as regions of food producers, and later also adding other sales markets beyond Germany.\n\n\n## 5. Business Model\n\nThe business model is centered around a sales commission of 4% of net turnover on sales via the epelia.com platform. This is also what we currently charge, making some (while not too much) of revenue already. So the long-term sustainability of the approach hinges on attracting enough business turnover via this food shopping platform. For which we seek knock-on funding for founding the first few regional cells and for public relations to find customers for their products, on the German market for now.\n\nWe also leverage the efficiency of our e-commerce portal for sustainability: it is based on a software specifically developed for us that automates everything from sales to invoicing (and later also translations). This allows us to focus on public relations work: up to a size of 10 foreign regions (adding 200-300 manufacturers to the platform), we can manage the platform's workload with a team of just two or three full-time persons. That team will be supported with freelance \u201cbroker agents\u201d who travel their home regions in different European regions to talk about this food manufacturer network and found new regional cells, compensated with a part of the trade commission paid by \u201ctheir\u201d manufacturers.", "created_at": "2013-12-02 13:03:17", "updated_at": "2018-02-17 17:43:40.193983", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1284, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 1095.8, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 3811, 3791], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12562, "user_id": 129, "topic_id": 2228, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Good work!</b>\n\nMy comments have been mentioned by Nadia. <span>Put a deadline for the send out, so we can get back in a couple\u00a0of days/weeks and send a reminder again.</span>\n\nAdd, format, include a pic \u00a0- \u00a0and send out!\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-12-02 17:06:59", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:11.545056", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 61, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [11665], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14871, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5599, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Technology, schmechnology</b>\n\nThis seems to be a hardcore tech conference.

The whole thing is way too emotional, because voting according to guts is at risk of bringing about very bad things (if you are interested in this, you might want to read Bryan Caplan\u2019s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_the_Rational_Voter\">The myth of the rational voter</a>). Last year for example, we had a string of referenda in Italy, on highly relevant issues like nuclear energy and water management. My countrymen talked surprisingly little of, well, nuclear energy and water management. You would come across statements like \u201cI don\u2019t trust this country with nuclear\u201d (written, presumably, by somebody who entrusts a state hospital with her life, or a state school with educating her children) or \u201cgive our future back to our children\u201d (meaning use more nuclear because it produces fewer greenhouse gases or using more coal and oil because they are not radioactive?).\n\nI think (hope) that open data could help to realign these discussion. Not only data point to facts, but discussing on their interpretation leads to ever more sophisticated analysis. \u201cLook here! Under the Grays\u2019 rule GDP grew much faster than the measly 0.3% a year of the Colored administration!\u201d \u201cYes, but consider that the years of the Colored government coincided with a world recession. The right indicator is the difference in growth rate between our country and the world average, and that shows clearly how wise the policies of the Coloreds\u2019 government were.\u201d To win an argument like this, the contenders need to delve deep into the datum.

How to interpret it?\n\nFor this to happen, clearly, data are essential, but not sufficient: you also need a part of the public opinion that knows how to use them to build stories on our living together, and contribute them to public debate.

There are so many threads and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll be able to unwind them all.\n\nFor once I\u2019m going to try to write things out in public and not caring what other people may think. Although it sometimes feels like you put yourself on the line when there are search engines that makes sure you\u2019re indexable for eternity. I guess there is a beauty to that too. Everyone can be immortal now.\n\nI\u2019m now sitting on a train heading towards an internship. But I\u2019ll start from the beginning. Something like three years ago.\n\n<strong>Being a part of the climate movement</strong>\n\nThat was the time I got involved in the climate movement, it was the year of 2009. I had been studying Japanese for about three years with one of the years in Japan. After I got home from Japan in 2008 I had been studying some single courses like international relations and human ecology. After the course in international relations I had decided that I wanted to pursue political science.\n\nAt that time I was still thinking that I wanted to become a diplomat for a Swedish ambassador. My role model was and still is Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld who was general secretary for UN some 50 years ago. But over time my perception of him has changed from something I\u2019d like to become professionally to someone I admire. Which also reminds me of his wonderful book waymarks.\n\nBut as I was saying, the year is 2009 and I\u2019m pursuing political science. Firs term passed I started to get more involved in a student organization called H\u00e5llbart Universitet (in english: students for a sustainable university). I remember that I at one time was sitting in the countryside at a party, I think it was March or April. My now former girlfriend was there. We were enjoying ourselves. There was a person who had been involved in the climate movement for a long time. He was russian and had come here to study.\n\nWe talked and I thought it sounded really exciting, because it was. I guess I have a lot to thank him for in some ways. For being an enabler at that time. He invited us to go to Bonn, because the year 2009 there was going to be the big climate summit in Copenhagen when things were going to be solved. It was the big COP15.\n\nWe were organizing to be a part of the meeting in Bonn which was one of the many meetings that was a part of the whole procedure of UNFCCC (United nations framework on climate change).\n\nAnd I got the opportunity to be a part of a project called Adopt a Negotiator. It was and still is, although it has morphed slightly, a project designed as citizen journalism around the UNFCCC process. At the end of 2009 there were 14 young people covering UNFCCC from their country\u2019s perspective. They adopted their lead negotiator. Thus I had adopted my country\u2019s lead negotiator, the lead negotiator of Sweden.\n\nLooking backward, it felt like I was too small to fill the role. I had to grow fast to fill in the role. Perhaps it was around that time I started to feel that I wasn\u2019t able to do enough or the right things. It was the most stressful time of my life participating during those meetings. So much going on all the time, but at the same time, nothing. It was moving at a snail\u2019s pace.\n\nSheer frustration.\n\nPeople were talking. But nothing was happening. As you may know it\u2019s still going on, with little movement forward. The behemoth called UNFCCC with the jokingly slogan (UNF*C* the world).\n\nDuring second part of 2009 I attended two meetings in Bonn, one in Bangkok and then COP15 in Copenhagen. I learnt a lot. I got to see political science up front, in real life and at the end I wasn\u2019t very impressed. I whole-heartedly admire the people trying to put up with it, trying with all their might to influence the process and they do, but the results make me sigh and despair.\n\nCOP15 started and ended. The results: it was proclaimed as a failure. It all depends on what kind of perspective you see it. It wasn\u2019t the meeting that brought a treaty that could save the climate and bring us down to a safe level, a failure. But on the other hand, the meeting was also on the verge of collapse, so in that sense it was a success. The process could continue. Objectively though, it was and still is a failure. But political realities doesn\u2019t account for planetary boundaries.\n\nTo be honest, something died within me at the end of COP15. A dream. I had just completed my first semester of Political Science at the end of Copenhagen. I still decided that I would continue to study Political Science to get a bachelor\u2019s degree. But what was I pursuing?\n\nAnd the quest for paid work was just about to begin. Somewhat lost and with a faint sense of direction where I was heading.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-13 11:55:31", "updated_at": "2017-09-02 10:24:54.265650", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 942, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 15.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27695, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 6273, "post_number": 21, "raw": "<b>In-platform events treatment is unrealistic</b>\n\nBuilding a comprehensive solution for events would be very expensive, and we only would use them a few times a year.

of the LOTE. \u00a0Rightly life after LOTE marks a new beginning, but experience shows that new beginnings often get buried in the ER platform....\n\nThese notes summarise sessions and conversations, and half-conversations, then they run wild. \u00a0\n\nBen and I have discussed most of this as holding points/ places to orient ourselves when we have still to unearth what will become our collective unMo culture. \u00a0\n\nGiorgio Agamben's book<em> The Highest Poverty,</em> and ten days living in that\u00a0other Materan re-monastery -<em> Le Monacelle</em> have flavoured my meditations.\n\n<strong>The unMo</strong></span>\n\n<span>Designed to mobilse the collective wisdom of the group, the unMonastery is an unusual workhouse\u00a0where\u00a0often\u00a0economically marginal\n\nnomadic freelancers\u00a0take up community subsidised residencies\u00a0in exchange for their often highly specialised skills.\u00a0</span>\n\n<strong><span>Parables of the unMon</span></strong>\n\n<span>If the last man finished turns out the lights, I get to write the last word.\u00a0\n\nOn my secret last day in Matera, when everyone else had hopped on the bus, I finally crossed the divide.\u00a0\n\nNot to the inviting Murgia, but to the neighbouring monastery that does so dominate our view; in the unverifably old <em>Cripta di San Giuliano</em> sub-church that forms as an invisible appendix to the XVIII Century edifice that we see daily, for the grand entrance fee of \u20ac1, my path finally crossed those of our predecessors... \u00a0<strong>How does our unWorship witness theirs?</strong>\u00a0 The XVI Century social organs that erected these monuments reflected a spiritual currency.\u00a0 At the top, the ecclesiastical aristocrats who dispersed it commissioned vivid frescos left, right and centre; beneath them slaved the waves of worker nuns and worker monks who kept the grand operation churning.\u00a0 Responsible for maintaining an atmosphere of religious fever, and aided by generous amounts of sleep deprivation and chronic sonorous head vibration induced by all that chanting, they staggered about in sufficient perpetual euphoric rapture to keep the entire community convinced of their do-gooding. \u00a0<em>Is this also us?</em>\n\nOur version of the unHolier than thou, while it must seek this rapture, cannot afford to take shortcuts. \u00a0\n\nTraditionally,one surrendered ones robes, name and hair at the monastery gates...</span>\n\n<strong><span>The Rigours of the unMonastery</span></strong>\n\n<span>Life in the unMonastery offers a cross between an artistic residency and a spiritual retreat.\u00a0 Our progression towards one-size-fits-all <em>praecepta vitalia</em> (vital precepts) has not yet reached its conclusion; the collective journey towards this wisdom shall in itself become a source of valuable knowledge. \u00a0The constraints of establishing our Matera prototype almost overnight require that these precepts evolve at an inorganic pace, drawing copiously upon both historical monastic practice and the traditions of squatters, can initially inform our life rhythms and decision making processes...\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>In choice of diet, interactive patterns and work load, we shall perhaps approach the model of self-development communities.\u00a0 Only our development and </span><span>disciplines are</span><span>\u00a0of the collective self.\u00a0 Aspects of our individual programming shall inevitably be dropped at the door.\u00a0 Work is to be done.</span>\n\n<span>Beyond designing a re-fit for urban geeks who haven\u2019t yet succumbed to their gluten intolerance, the unMonastery is a service organ.\u00a0 We shall survive by creating inviting rhythms and rituals that allow us to embrace a life of devotion in the face of a crumbling game.\u00a0 Our medium must be internal human warmth. We seek to build a regime of personal acceptance and confrontation with a generous proportion of collective triumph augmented by sensual feedback.\u00a0 Through communion with our deepest nature - the dance\u00a0and most excellent food shall be our currency of conversion.\u00a0 Our vow of silence may become a periodic vow of non-verbalism/ non-connectivity.</span>\n\n<strong><span>Alternative Cycles - Periodic Regulation</span></strong>\n\n<span>Women who share the same roof, often co-ordinate their ovation cycles. \u00a0It remains to be seen whether the creative powers of fellow unMonasterians will similarily coordinate to one another (and to that of the moon.) \u00a0While we shall observe the passing of each lunar cycle, our work week shall absorb the administrative rhythm of our host societies.\u00a0 Life will be organised in cycles two weeks (the in-week and the out-week) culminating in our legendary thematic open door rites of celebration.\n\n(The proposal for this cycle with parties met with considerable enthusiasm at the LOTE and has been incorporated in the sketch of\u00a0our unRule/unOrder. \u00a0The deeper description as to it's content lies buried in my <a href=\"http://http://bembodavies.com/stockmann-process/\">unMonastery 1.0 webstuff</a>. \u00a0The unStazione Ritual performed with help of </span><a aria-haspopup=\"true\" aria-owns=\"js_13\" class=\"profileLink\" data-hovercard=\"/ajax/hovercard/page.php?id=203871826321305\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/centroiac?ref=br_rs\" id=\"js_14\" style=\"color: rgb(59, 89, 152);

there is therefore little in human history that suggests that this humanist <em>laissez faire</em> tradition, is our wisest choice. \u00a0</span>\n\n<span>The proposed discipline is one of no internal unions -- should this repel those who inevitably find themselves in a mutual worship configuration, we must become adroit at celebrating these inevitable potentials with festivals of projection/ denial/ heartbreak. \u00a0 Should exclusive unions occur, they are encouraged to form an outer unMo ring to recycling the energy and the promise by becoming leaders of the vespers.</span>\n\n<span>At the same time it is unlikely that we can creatively release absolutely everyones personal histories of trauma.\u00a0 To the best of the assembled unMonastarians capacity, those suffering shall be granted \u2018time\u2019.\u00a0 Meditation, long walks and periods of silence shall be complimented by periods of respectful listening.\u00a0 Skills from far and wide are to be mobilised to return the unNun into a disciplined life of service.\u00a0 Growth strategies are many.</span>\n\n<span><em><strong>Mining the unMonastery Metaphor</strong></em>\n\nBen picked this phrase in his interview with Sam. \u00a0It is apt. \u00a0</span><span>From the moment of the first public voicing of the unWord at the LOTE#1 gathering, exploring the imagery of the unMonastery has been a source of joy and inspiration.\u00a0 What started as perhaps a rather flimsy premise has been consistently strengthened by the latent power in the history of monastic practice. \u00a0</span>\n\n<span>At LOTE#2 a sub-group spent three days hacking <em>\u201cThe Lore of the unMo\u201d</em>.\u00a0 (provide link for historians if the document still\u00a0exisits) \u00a0Extracting direction from our collective associative matrix, we shuffled together a collective document that generated much seductive mirth.\u00a0 Much later, a brief conference call comment from Bembo sent Alberto off on a pivotal exploration into the credo of the Benedictines.\u00a0 (This should be considered mandatory reading - as it traces the evolution of a decentralised anarchist movement of radical dropouts that has lasted 1200 years.) \u00a0</span><em style=\"border: none;

an attempt to replicate its central threads is performed here:</span>\n\n<span>(desperately awaiting reports from 1 + 2)\n\n<strong>Group 3 --\u00a0 \u00a0</strong></span><strong><span> watershed = key breakthrough\n\ndecisive moments that enabled the unMo to so negotiate successfully.</span></strong>\n\n<span>Although a minority of historians claim to have unearthed evidence among archaic web logs that reveal that the legendary early delegates, to say, the Matera Meeting of 2013, were an unPrecedented bunch of tossers, the accepted wisdom is to praise them for their foresight.</span>\n\n<span>Key initial choices to avoid the divisive extremes of visionary projection, and to hold developments to the current realities generated a robust, flexible unMo practice.\u00a0 The early unMo communities became expert at the culture of change and in harnessing the collective wisdoms of groups with an uncanny capacity absorb positive organic small scale inventions that recycled much energy into their community service.</span>\n\n<span>Their work was clearly\u00a0 value based - not solely determined by the tasks at hand, but through an articulate shared vision that remained flexible and syncronised even when working in a decentralised, work distributed pattern. \u00a0\n\nSo skilled at transforming conflict to creative friction did we become that major organisations such as the International Union of Black Sheep and the Disgruntled Young Peoples\u2019 Alliance ( formerly unEmployed Youth of the Earth) quickly found their way to the unMo.\u00a0 The total package lifestyle solution that supplied a meaningful life of dedicated service and camaraderie, rapidly became so essential to many people\u2019s existence that the unMo practice became the cultural norm.\u00a0\n\nOnce the movement reached this critical mass, it exhibited such acute flexibility as to virtually unUnmonasterise itself, providing a wide dispersement of wisdom without any signs of confining ideological dogma.</span>\n\n<span>Perhaps the key development upon which the movements survival was predicated was the broad endorsement of invisible structures.\u00a0 So culturally implicit in their collective decision making process did this become, that the unRule became dictated by the daily tasks and seasonal rhythms rather than any planning organ.\u00a0 This new freedom quickly permeated the unMo vision of service saving considerable regulation and meeting time.</span>\n\n<span>For example, since they did not seek to replicate the apartheid of the sexes, the early unMos required creative solutions to mitigate what appeared an impasse.\u00a0 While the less unPalatable term of the unMonasterian still circles in the literature, (Presumably so us to not to frighten the uninitiated), the choice to adopt the universal gender of the \u2018unNun\u2019 was never unWrong.\u00a0 As a demarcation of a deeper commitment to tweak historic connotations, it freed us of an insidious rhetorical constraint.\u00a0 Despite initial confusion, it soon became clear that, independent of individual hormonal configurations, we could all stand proudly forth and declare that:\u00a0 \u201cWe are unNuns.\u201d</span>\n\n<span>This ritual act of surrendering your gender was of course bad anthropology, most of us still identify deeply with our chromosomes.\u00a0 Fraught with danger, this bold symbolic step towards redressing the wounds of the past, required\u00a0 several years of contention before we acquired sufficient dis-entrenchment tools and the community was prepared to sample the wisdom in this idea.\u00a0 When none of us are <em>nuns</em>; we can all take an equidistant step away from the subservient role historically thrust upon them.\u00a0 If, during periods in our process, the work requires moving towards the traditional realm of the nun, those of both hormonal lineage could take these steps with respect.\u00a0 Through the years other non-skill oriented general titles were employed.\u00a0 These denoted seniority or perceptible personal engagement, and often reflected local social alliances.</span>\n\n<strong><span>The Art of the Party</span></strong>\n\n<span>The bi-weekly cycle of Open Parties fired the daily life of the unMos.\u00a0 The 26 annual markings of the meeting places between what at the start must have appeared a minor, incoherent sect, quickly grew to become a vital interface with the host community.\u00a0 Designing ritual celebrating for each Seasons, for the Elements, for traditional local and global traditions, and including children and families these most human of gatherings both enhanced and informed the strategies of community take-over and the de-unMonastration process.</span>\n\n<strong><span>The Book of Greater and Lesser Failures.</span></strong>\n\n<span>A key tool in the spread of the unMo idea was a capacity to admit our fears and vulnerabilities.\u00a0 Not all unMo work progressed smoothly.\u00a0 More than anything else the erection of <em>Strasbourg Totems</em> as a central ritual element of evaluation provided the unMonasterians with a tactile manner to recycle their inevitable frustrations.\u00a0 Meeting regularly round the magnetic negative Pole to balance their aims and strategies and process any unPleasantness.\u00a0 That they would then quickly re-form around the triumphant positive pole to dance their simple truths of humanness, allowed them to keep.</span>\n\n<strong><span>UnunMo</span></strong>\n\n<span>At some point ER and unMo vanished as a distinguishable organ;\u00a0dropping its identity as people became absorbed by a deeper unity of purpose.\u00a0 Years of respectful interdependence, while constantly promoting fresh ideas and renewal, lead to the\u00a0 dissolution of formal structures at organic points. \u00a0</span><span> And while the functions of a collective work station for itinerant freelancers certainly became the norm and unMo-like houses still littered the countryside, so much a part of the fabric of life had they become that other alliances defined the networks...</span>\n\n", "created_at": "2013-11-16 16:26:37", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:11.690666", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 3929, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6826, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 5032, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Hm</b>\n\nHe has quite a <a href=\"/t/stewardship-through-market-goggles/4060/12\">readership</a> here on edgeryders, but my money is on <a href=\"/u/hexayurt\">@hexayurt</a>\u00a0to be at the shortest no. of hops away from him.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-12-03 15:24:14", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:40.292326", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 47, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2694], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22745, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 3144, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Access to send from contact@edgeryders.eu</b>\n\nHave sent you access details via the edgeryders.eu contact form, since damn Google still is unable to detect spam properly (blocking my e-mails to you ...).

Most of my social network tends to revolve around two topics - Music and Politics. Both of these topics are something I am very in to, and I find that my enthusiasm for these brings other people towards me, and I to them. I used to be a regular music reviewer/co-editor for a music website, so a lot of people I know online, I met through that avenue. Twitter seems to be for Politics, and Facebook is definitely more music oriented. Twitter is very politically aware as I follow feeds that brings news to me, and it's fast and straight to the point. It's not the ideal place for debate, but it brings me enough information to be informed and perhaps go forward to write my own blog posts. I am reluctant to bring the politics over to Facebook as I tend to get quite in to how I see things if I have the space to do so, and it is not in my nature to alienate people. My political views aren't awful, but I have a varied amount of friends whose politics and beliefs vary too, and I'd rather not find out that someone I get along with say, musically, is someone whose political beliefs are very different to mine. Twitter I can easily step away from, and whilst I use it a lot, I take things in an impersonal way. The more content there is and the more room for explanation, the more someone has to dis/agree with, and the more space to get personal. Finding common/uncommon ground isn't terrible, but I haven't found it easy to maintain a distance when things don't go well.\n\nMy perception of people and building resilient networks is really hard for me as I had what is best described as a 'social media meltdown' at the end of last year. Facebook, to me, cheapened friendships. I had so many people (over 500) on my \"friends\" list and so very few people seemed to know or care what was going on in my outside facebook life. It was a truly empty experience. It was akin to shouting at an empty wall, and I missed actual physical interaction, and sharing ideas. I've calmed down a lot on the matter now, but I am now very choosy about who is on my facebook, and what I do and don't share. I even use a psudonym so I can post as I like without work colleagues being involved (I'm easy enough to find if needs be though), or anyone finding any information about me online. That being said though without the irregular contact with people, my outside facebook life would be quite empty as if you're not around and not reporting on your life and what you're trying to achieve, you are forgotten easily. Whilst Facebook/Social Media in general is a very good thing, people have forgotten about the pleasure there is in being in someone's physical company, or hearing their voice, and I am trying to spend less time and less energy with my online world, so that my outside world can be full of experience. I went to Strasbourg at the weekend, and saw a few people I know online and it was lovely to see them and to hear them speak (<span>J'aime</span>\u00a0<span>les accents</span>\u00a0<span>fran\u00e7ais!)</span>. Living in front of your laptop all the time is no life at all, and social media could do with working on that so social media doesn't become antisocial.\u00a0\n\nAs for the dangers, I'm not super savvy with this, but I am concerned as to what big companies use data for. I am keen to see a facebook alternative where the people using it, are the people who are the stakeholders. Information isn't sold along to whoever wants it for big money. I know Diaspora was being touted as the next big thing, but I've heard very little from that camp. Future social media users need to regain the control of the internet, otherwise our laptops are another television screen, trying to sell to us, and sell us just as equally. We don't pay for these services and they have to support the technology somehow, but how to do it and ethically is the question. I am equally worried about Twitter as I see tweets used in more traditional media and hope that permission is requested, regardless of if the tweet is out in the public domain or no. A new way of doing things really needs to be looked in to by more technical savvy people, in the mean time though, I do urge some restraint, having not shown any in the past, anything you say online can hamper your future, and there are phases of my life online that I rather wish weren't but it is experience in all things that allow us to learn. The video I've attached is a great way of getting my point across.\n\nThis post may come across as slightly negative, but my online life is a beautiful collection of people, organisations, and ways of reaching out to people I never thought possible, and that beauty has to be maintained in the face of ongoing big business trying to use if for their own ends. Get people interested, involved and motivated, and social media becomes a new plain of existence where we learn about one another, other cultures, and educate ourselves in a much richer way. There needs to be balance though. An online life is no life if the outside world suffers greatly from a lack of interaction with it. There is a world out there, that is so much richer than the one on your screen, and people need to remember that.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-23 18:20:40", "updated_at": "2017-11-13 18:19:55.156497", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1038, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 15.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30466, "user_id": 119, "topic_id": 4748, "post_number": 20, "raw": "<b>When all you have is a hammer...</b>\n\nI think that perhaps the punchy way I phrased my critique may have miscommunicated a critical nuance that I actually mentioned: I do think that there are specific conditions where do-ocracy works (although again, I think the common term for this organisational form is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhocracy\">adhocracy</a>). As mentioned, in projects where everyone starts at around the same time and where the goals are clear enough for everyone, it can work fine and actually be a lot of fun. E.g. a good family celebration essentially works this way, or at least ours do. (We don't call it an adhocracy, but it's functionally the same.)\n\nHowever, as with many of the organisational approaches you mention, it seems to me that misapplication is the real problem. A lot of that adhocracy thinking came from the Burning Man festival through the San Fransisco startup culture. (They probably got it from some Berkely hippies in the 70ies, but that's just complicating matters.) In my view, the attempt is to emulate a feeling of freedom and community experienced in good adhocracy environments, without realising just how different a temporary festival isolated in the Mojave desert is from e.g. a large and long-term commercial endeavour.\n\nThe same goes for hierarchy, consensus decision making or representational structures. I would add dual structures to the list. Respectively, those approaches work very well for the military, marriage, large scale/extremely heterogeneous\u00a0environments (like national politics) and non-profit/volunteer structures. But when they are applied in each others context, they just tend to fail quite spectacularly. This actually works better with your \"spices for hot climates\" analogy, wouldn't you say? The best adapted the methodology for the problem at hand is the most successful. Problems can be very, very different, so the \"most effective\" processes will necessarily differ.\n\nI'd also say that your characterisation/analogy with evolution breaks down completely when it comes to \"competition\". This sort of \"survival of the fittest\" idea a common misinterpretation of how evolution actually works. If it were really that way, we'd see far less diversity, but more importantly we'd see life \"compete\" mostly in the \"best\" region on earth. Yet life expands and adapt into all sorts of harsh environments. \"Survival of the fittest\" is not about being fittest amongst other life forms (competition), but about being the fittest to live in a particular ecological niche (environment). (Dawkins and other argue this point more extensively.) All of which also reinforces my point that various forms of social interaction may very well work best in a particular niche, but not others. (Warfare, markets, creative projects, romantic relationships, etc etc.)\n\nI would also disagree with the characterisation that people tend to internalise a particular approach, effectively <em>becoming</em> \"hierarchical\" or \"adhocracist\". Isn't it so that we tend to adapt to the cultural environment we are in and can move between environments quite fluidly? Sure, there are people that bring their preferred methodology and attempt to get everyone to adopt it. But it's quite rare and usually ineffective, no? For those cases, we have the perfect idiom: if all you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail.\n\nI don't understand your comment regarding the monasteries. Sure, they were successful, but as you mention, incredibly difficult to commit to. And, by extension, not that popular/exclusionary (when viewed against total population). This was exactly my point: yes, ideal speech is more or less attainable, but it cannot ever work in a heterogenous group where such olympian mental gymnastics are simply unattainable for most.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-02-05 21:01:27", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:47.750919", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 632, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 20.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [30388], "is_liked_by": [3067], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31045, "user_id": 1890, "topic_id": 2636, "post_number": 16, "raw": "Twitter is quite small in Armenia... but happy to give it a try.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-06 19:15:48", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:50.757262", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 15, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [31024], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6681, "user_id": 2464, "topic_id": 5351, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Server in Germany</b>\n\nYou probably mean:\n\nServer in Germany \u2013 best data protection law in *Europe*, if not the world :-)\n\n", "created_at": "2016-03-02 08:54:57", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:39.259871", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 25, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2448], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11818, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 1736, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>oh yes, also</b>\n\nwhat do you want to achieve with this? why do you think others are getting getting involved in organising the meetups?\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-18 16:04:58", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:07.817517", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 28, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23018, "user_id": 217, "topic_id": 3476, "post_number": 14, "raw": "<b>here it is</b>\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/82554988\n\n", "created_at": "2014-08-10 11:36:38", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:07.809578", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 11, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [22251], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27751, "user_id": 680, "topic_id": 1316, "post_number": 19, "raw": "<b>Ti ho scritto mail</b>\n\nL'hai ricevuta?\n\n", "created_at": "2012-03-08 10:03:57", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:33.106581", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 11, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [20480], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6309, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 6276, "post_number": 1, "raw": "**_Available in: :gb: [English](#en) / :ka: [Georgian](#ka)_**\n\n----------\n\n## :gb: **_English version_** <a name=\"en\"></a>\n\nAnne looks around with excitement. The 20 something from Rustavi has a lot to share and is happy to be in a room with a diverse group of people from her hometown Rustavi, an industrial city in Georgia, merely 20 minutes driving south of the capital Tbilisi.\n\n![img](/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e8875bc622eab9a063c3ebf381a104bb4be7fa68.jpg)\n\n<em>Photos: Daro Sulakauri/UNDP</em>\n\nThe city, wide avenues and grey, tall, Soviet building blocks, was founded and flourished during Soviet times. Now, Anne\u2019s hometown is struggling with a mostly commuting population, and disappearing cohesive communities.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t stop Anne to push for improvements in the past few years. The petite lady - with her raven black hair, false eyelashes to accentuate her big eyes, and heels higher than I can ever imagine walking on - does not look like your typical activist, but already initiated several different projects to improve her city.\n\n\u201cI want to show the people in my city new things,\u201d Anne says proudly, explaining that her and her friend collected books from people in her city and the region around it, to donate them to the city\u2019s prison. \u201cOne guy even gave his whole library!\u201d she says with her eyes lighting up when talking about the experience.\n\n![img](/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6ac3fecb476a9e60e88ea5780036f21a77c8926e.jpg)\n\n<em>Photos: Daro Sulakauri/UNDP</em>\n\nVolunteering is not a usual practise in Georgia, with most people volunteering only at the country\u2019s largest religious institution, the Georgian orthodox church. According to the 2015 Caucasus Barometer, an annual cross country survey in Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia, only 21% of Georgia\u2019s population volunteered without compensation ([http://caucasusbarometer.org/en/cb2015ge/ACTVLNT/](http://caucasusbarometer.org/en/cb2015ge/ACTVLNT/)). Although in 2013 this was only 14%, the number is still quite low.\n\nHowever, Rustavi seems to be an exception. After having worked and lived in and out of Tbilisi for the past 10 years, I am happily surprised to encounter various different people in Rustavi working to make their city a better place without receiving any kind of compensation for it.\n\n![img](/uploads/default/original/2X/8/84307f0d655c77ed8985f9fc8c6d4a2fd2e40f53.jpg)\n\nBut as a result, we realize during our 2 day visit to this interesting city, most of the people who work on projects, are mostly worried they can not secure financing to actually implement their projects. Or they are asked by several large NGOs and donor organizations, to work for free on a daily basis.\n\n\u201cI am already to busy with my own projects,\u201d one student at Rustavi\u2019s Rvali University tells us annoyed, not realizing that we are here to find out what it is they are working on, instead of asking them to work for free for our own projects.\n\nBut when we dig a little bit deeper, not only during our visit, but also through online outreach, we find that many of them are either working on an improved urban landscape, or have many ideas on how to make Rustavi a liveable, cohesive city. From creating bicycle lanes, to making the city more colorful, to book sharing in the park, to reviving the city\u2019s soccer fan club.\n\n\u201cI believe that it will deepen the solidarity and social consciousness,\u201d Ninca, who became a member of the fan club a few years ago, writes on our newly founded facebook group Futuremakers Rustavi. \u201c[It] will give us an amazing opportunity to create one organized and mobilized community,\u201d Ninca writes.\n\n![img](/uploads/default/original/2X/2/2ac0842bedc07d2272ba36a9ded7985f84df7ad6.jpg)\n\n<em>Photos: Daro Sulakauri/UNDP</em>\n\nAnd during our workshop on the second day of our visit, where we meet among others the young Anne, it is inspiring to see the ideas the group - ranging from Rotary members, to scouts, to a representative of the taxi drivers\u2019 union, to political science students, to ordinary citizens - come up with to revive the city\u2019s centrally located and old park. And most can be done with little resources.\n\n\u201cTheir is no safe crossing to the park, not even a Zebra,\u201d a girl active with the scouting group says, adding that the road, on which cars often speed, could perhaps get obstacles to discourage speeding.\n\nOther ideas voiced during our workshop are to make the park more colorful, to add hammocks, to create a reading and book-sharing space (in an old train compartment or bus), to add removable chairs and tables to a patio on the lake, to create an outdoor game area, and to utilize the large lake by introducing boats.\n\n![img](/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c9621ffc22cb965374535ea7f97e9ff35522fc27.jpg)\n\n<em>Photos: Daro Sulakauri/UNDP</em>\n\nAnd brainstorming about these ideas did not only result in interesting possible future changes to the city, but it also was a great experience for people who not know each other, to understand their city and community is more lively and exciting than they thought it was.\n\n![img](/uploads/default/original/2X/2/248168763ca9e6ced2ba584c7adb8429ef73f734.jpg)\n\n<em>Photos: Daro Sulakauri/UNDP</em>\n\n\u201cI am meeting so many inspiring people here today,\u201d a taxi driver and human rights activist tells us, \u201cwith these kind of people we can really make a change.\u201d\n\n----------\n##:ka: **_Georgian version_** <a

We created something very different and proved it to be effective.\n\nIt's less than 24 hours later but we're already seeing outcomes. Firstly we reached a lot of people, according to tweet reach: 100,000s with 667 tweets in total.\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.hashtracking.com/explorer/?hashtag=unmon\" style=\"color: rgb(7, 130, 193);\">https://www.hashtracking.com/explorer/?hashtag=unmon</a>\n\nDuring the event it was reported that we'd managed to become a trending topic in Italy (this was definitely a surprise): Fabio do you have the link you shared in the hangout? For those watching from the sidelines, it was certainly an event to remark upon.\n\n\u00a0\n\nhttps://twitter.com/spitzenprodukte/statuses/382082163241652224\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe also gained over 50 new followers.\n\nIn addition we're already seeing our first <a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/collaboratively-written-article-for-the-guardian-what-uk-local-government-can-learn-from\">press opportunities begin to emerge</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/unmonastery-and-openstreetmap\">potential collaborators</a>. The main gauge for success will ultimately though be more applicants to the unMonastery and more attendees at \\#LOTE3.\n\nWhat I think we learnt that are essential points for the future.\n\n-Either pre-schedule all tweets or have at least two people operating the main account, it was quite a multitasking exercise, tweeting the prepared tweets in 2 languages and fielding questions from my own account simultaneously.\n\n-Calling people a day or so before hand seemed to be effective for gaining real participation\n\n-Find a better way of reaching journalists, sending tweets to individuals in the hour before hand hasn't seemed to bare fruit, but perhaps time will tell.\n\n-Create a dashboard, we didn't do this but a page with the hashtag embedded and a chat room, so you only have to co-ordinate from a single location would be exceptionally useful.\n\n-Co-ordinate around who is going to taking a question first, then allow others to follow up\n\nI've yet to fully review everything but have downloaded the data and done an initial network graph of how the conference played out. There's a few actionables to be picked up if anyone has the time:\n\n-Create a storify in Italian and English\n\n<span>-Pull down the twitter data and report on what you find\n\n-Help write the article for the Guardian\n\n-Share the press releases further afield, found on this new page:\u00a0</span><a href=\"http://unmonastery.eu/index.php/press/\" style=\"color: rgb(7, 130, 193);\">http://unmonastery.eu/index.php/press/</a>\n\nSo what did everyone else think?

We grew out of <a href=\"http://www.gulic.org\">the local linux user group</a>, and so far we've done the usual: cooperatively buy a 3D printer and then start printint parts for the offspring (more 3D printers!), build a couple of <a href=\"http://www.canarnova.blogspot.com.es/2011/02/montaje-cupcake-2.html\">small hexayurt models</a> (not just me, but two others, yay!), created an inexpensive 3D printer where the 3D movement is done using very inexpensive off-the-shelf \"guides for drawers\" (\"gu\u00edas para cajones\" in Spanish), and a platform on wheels with a battery and a webcam to be used as a <a href=\"http://www.canarnova.blogspot.com.es/2012/03/guimar-farm-explorer.html\">farm robot</a>.\n\nIn that environment, creativity just happens, and we're thinking we should crowdsource the building of a machine to cut metal pieces and build all sorts of things. (For those into details, opensourceecology.org's CNC torch table.)\n\nIn a nutshell, I think technology needs to be open, appropriate and agile. In Spanish, that's \"abierta, apropiada &amp; \u00e1gil\", which gives us a nice AAA or A\u00b3.\n\n\"Open\" means you really own what you bought or built. At the very least, you can unscrew it to replace broken parts etc. \"Appropriate\" means you use local materials when available (except metals which you'll then use for a thousand years, or if you want to house a million in Haiti, in which - if that's what you want to do - you might consider importing several million panels of plywood, so it really depends), and certainly you want to make it cold-resistent in Helsinki, and ant-resistent in the jungle.\n\nNow, \"agile\". We need to look at several levels of \"agile\". <a href=\"http://opensourceecology.org/wiki/Scrum\">For each project</a>, modularity lets people work in parallel: you do the wheels and I do the battery and that other group works on the webcam. As a meta-level, we're hoping networks of <a href=\"http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/\">hackerspaces</a> will welcome us as soon as we have some room to set up a hackerspace ourselves.\n\nI'm into resilience. I think these groups and networks are a great resource (among others) in any European society. They could use some help and attention.\n\nNow, I know no technofix will be enough. We're still a culture that has a history of converting natural resources into toxic waste, and even if we change our ways a lot, the (metaphorical) ex-smoker will still have (metaphorical) damaged lungs.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-10 17:33:56", "updated_at": "2017-09-20 13:58:01.861073", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 491, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4357, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 4324, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Present: Dorotea, Michael, Manuel, Noemi, Nadia, Alberto and... surprise: in the call we were lucky to have Natali Arslan and <a href=\"/u/chara_oikonomidou\">@chara.oikonomidou</a>\u00a0back :)\n\nThe core of the conversation was how to even start to think about a Living on the Edge (LOTE5) community event this year, if we are to<strong> build ever better, ever new, ever creative.</strong> We need open minds and open processes, that much we know. We also need leadership and commitment, and helping ourselves and others fall easier into roles without putting too much burden on anyone.\u00a0This ties nicely with previous community calls about community ownership (ping <a href=\"/user/6491\">@Adela_Militaru</a>).\n\n<em>We said we will each write a paragraph with our thoughts from our conversation, so here it is, fill away by Editing this wiki. <a href=\"/u/mishek\">@mishek</a>, @Dorotea, <a href=\"/u/manuelpueyo\">@Manuelpueyo</a>\u00a0please confirm you are seeing this wiki.</em>\n\n<em>Your thoughts</em>\n\nNoemi's thoughts:\n\nLote is valuable for me individually, so clearly I don't question if it's worth having or putting work into. However, I think it's important that we don't risk having the same people running the coordination, for reasons that have to do with 1.limited capacity of those same people and 2.concentration of sorts (resources, control etc) and unfair expectations. I am up for helping just as before, but under the leadership of a community member, someone that;s not from ER LbG.\u00a0\n\n//unstructured notes here\n\nNat : half Turkish half Brazilian, degree in Journalism, currently resides in \u00d6rebro, Sweden. Wants to gather more experience and have project when goes back to Turkey. Interested in citizen participation, smth related to online platform for democracy. Democracy OS. Pia Mancini. Online platform to increase citizen participation in political decisions. Example in Spain, Podemos. Similar thing in Greece, the Hub in Athens- not sure how that worked there, wasn't working before the elections.\n\nChara: was engaged in Edgeryders in the beginning, was working at the HUB in Vienna back then.. doing communications. Now working in London in a very corporate environment. Actively participating in Syriza- department in London. Doing General assemblies and trying to help.\n\nJeff: moved to Athens in 2011, but moved permanently a year ago to see what was going on in grassroots movements and social innovation projects (new term).\u00a0A few months ago started to get involved in department of invitations, doing it with immigrants in Athens. Started meeting individuals with skills we thought would be interesting to share with the community/city. next one is Monday- Eritrean pop up restaurant in exarchia?\u00a0Most of the things, the dinners, I am paying with my own money. Public transport is not ok, and people risk getting beaten up if they don't look greek enough so I pay for their cab.\u00a0Payment in kind for transport and food. CSR and bonus points. Not counting on funding but covering these small expenses so Jeff doesn't have to cover it all out of personal finances.\u00a0Had meeting with CEO (of what), they like unMonastery,\u00a0 but they are very slow. Also they want to see how newcomers play with the existing ecosystem- its very slow and formulaic.- events, podium, people clap and no one sees each other again.\n\nJeff: problem with social media- necessary but an impediment to get things done. Same thing with sending in applications etc - 90% time wasted.\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/en/department-of-invitations\n\nhttp://www.unitedinvitations.org/\n\nJeff: would like to build a kitchen hack space in Athens for people to come in book a time and use kitchen to do these events. People from every country, so could be very varied and interested\n\nChara: Have a friend who's a layer working with Syriza on immigration policy. Maybe can help. Will talk to person.\n\nJeff: Meetings are better because it's immediate feedback as to whether something is happening\n\nManuel: in the process of dropping previous job, will have sometime to explore new projects and collaborations which he can get involved in for skill development.\u00a0interested in digital communication, creating and managing communities in order to do things in collaborative ways. Have been running a project in Brussels called open kitchen- private space. Hidden district- is an online wineshop delivered by eco-transport. EC project Eures.\u00a0Spending some days in Madrid, next 4-5 months running open kitchen and hidden district. Want to go to events or organize things.\n\nLOTE5\n\nNoemi: Some of us are already thinking about what we want to do this year. We never ask, but maybe we should: Do you want to do it? Should we do it?\u00a0Running the lote events, and the community calls? Is there enough for you to get involved in making it happen?\n\n<em>rough consensus in that nobody said no.</em>\n\nNat: I would like to help, but cannot find a way in. Maybe we are shy or do not know which ways to offer help.\n\nDorofia: I understand your view Nat.\u00a0we need someone who can help people to get involved\n\nNoemi : For me it's the tension between leading a process but then becoming vulnerable in that position\n\nIdeas:\n\n-a good idea to have small ones too maybe in Berlin in the summer ? Dorotea offers to help\n\n-Bezdomny: what about a greek island? would be great to have it somewhere mild\n\n-couple with with a larger event, soo many things happening this summer anyway.\n\n-Michael: an event that has real local context, meaning and possiblity to involve/engage the interests of local people, something neighborhood based, probably an unmonastery type model again, that still seems to be the 'thing' that inspires many of us to want to continue evolving, inventing, re-inventing ...athens? other cities with a bit of unmon potential, anyone?\n\nDorofia: callfor taking leadership on things in collaborative ways could work ?\n\nNoemi Salantiu: Ok. so not asking who wants to participate. But at this stage ask who wants to take a leadership role?\n\nnat arslan: do we have a list of major responsibilities for previous Lote\u2019s\n\nNoemi Salantiu: yes. we have all documented\n\nChara Oikonomidou: can you share that doc?\n\nnat arslan: maybe matching a new member with an old member as a team.\n\nDorofia yes setting a theme ?\n\nnat arslan: so both can take care of a specific task\u00a0\n\nChara Oikonomidou: I'd be up for pairing with some existing members to build something new for LOTE\n\nDorofia: I think hared ownership questions could be relevant;\u00a0wants to help building teams by talking to people and helping them defines roles. Then matching them with others\n\nManuel: You have a platform that has been running for some years now. You need to find new people that bring new energy and motivation, using the channels we've already built to keep doing nice projects in the future. I identitfy with this because on a smaller scale it's the same thing that's happening with Open Kitchen. The platform is there. Want to find new people who lead the project.\n\nManuel likes the idea of a blank slate and thinking about formats with which to do this. Like open processes, like the Skype call.\n\n<strong><span>[everyone trying to synthesize something Nadia said]\u00a0</span></strong>\n\nManuel: You're looking for people that want to lead project and use platform of edgerydrs to make these projects happen.\n\nAlberto Cottica: Also: there is a risk that people refrain from leading, maybe thinking it's not really allowed.\n\nnat arslan: the process is consist of taking notes and analysing them and putting them into a compact way so that people that could not participate can catch up easily\n\nDoro: People complain and demand a lot instead of taking responsibility and improving things. It slows things down a lot and creates a lot of conflict in stead of improving things it is just damaging things.\n\nDoro: It is good if more people take leadership and create support network instead of competitive...how to bring more collaboration and avoid unproductive competition and exclusion.\n\nNat: Other than Edgeryders and Lote, is having new leaders that would take responsibility is the main point.\n\nMichael: some new ideas and concepts about group gatherings, organizational formats, collaborative forms and leadership were beginning to emerge in the conversation.\u00a0a few of us were beginning to voice and develop these...the silence was evident as signs of actual imbibing, serious digestion\u00a0in progress...\u00a0indeed, it was just starting to get interesting for me, but alas\u00a0due to our limited cyberspace meeting technology,\u00a0the time to really sit and think better together was not with us, thought forms ended up drifting off into the cyberstratosphere ...though i am hoping a couple of these ideas/concepts to still be\u00a0retrieved, some few words (maybe starting with nadia and dorothea)\u00a0captured here for further development and collaboration... a paragraph or two? ...maybe even in exquisite corpse style.... an\u00a0evolving\u00a0artifact in testimony to minds actually engaged in some form of collective\u00a0intelligence? ...an artifact as in a piece of parchment we hand around to one another\u00a0in our evolving\u00a0search for that compelling statement,\u00a0compelling\u00a0vision/inspiration... compelling questions for that future lote to really want to be birthed...\n\n", "created_at": "2015-04-23 19:08:32", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:24.486203", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1696, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 4, 2201], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2164, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 2131, "post_number": 1, "raw": "This is an overview of what came out of Lote3 in the form of pretty rough documentation posts.

I didn't know it existed when I was putting myself \u00a0through a six year degree I hated. I spent the bare minimum on campus making sure I passed the exams but not investing more, and took the opportunity given by the student grant and loan you get as a Swedish citizen when you go to uni, to do things like collaborate with the Royal College of Opera to put together a beautiful interactive show for the graduating class at the Royal Opera, do an internship at the studio of a renowned film director Roy Andersson to understand how he builds his films, build a strong pr mechanism for the degree program etc. And to study neuroscience! I got completely obsessed with cognitive neuroscience while studying media technology, then visual perception, then visual communication. I then joined a full time vocational program on interactive art direction at a school with no curriculum, no equipment, no tuition, no books...just live briefs from clients, and people from various design backgrounds...\n\nI didn't have a visual design background like the others, and had a very different approach towards design, I thought it would be a disadvantage but that did not turn out to be the case- clients and my classmates really liked my approach.\u00a0And something clicked for me when I realised that we were building really cool projects with no exchange of money. Money is the equivalent of time and skills and equipment. If you access to skills and time and equipment, money is not an issue. And you can get that access in many many ways. The bigger your network, the more generous you are with your own time and skills and equipment to help out others, the more generous others are towards you. If you keep your costs low ( I lived on an icebreaker with an extremely low rent and a strong community) and learn to teach yourself things quickly, you can build your own projects without money. If the project is good he money will come. If it doesn't, you have something to showcase your skills and competences with. And having an inner drive to realise things is highly appreciated and rewarded.\n\nSometimes I will start with a set idea about what I want to achieve, and then try to find money for it. This approach generally fails more often than it works, or has done in the past- it takes too long.\u00a0Being able to communicate what you want and how someone can help you is very important, and I'm still learning how to do it well. Figuring out which people who would see a value in helping me realise my projects is something I get better at with time and with a bigger network if I listen carefully and ask for feedback continuously.\u00a0\n\nSometimes I will be asked to do something like organise an event, and I will take the opportunity to push my clients to do something better and more interesting than they had originally set out to do- something which includes a project I was planning on realising anyway. Sometimes I just start making a project happen, by starting to build it and work on it as though I was being paid for it assuming that the money part will work itself out. And then a dynamic picks up, that people find it and get excited about it because it's different or strange and then they try to make space for me to work on their projects or within their organisation.\u00a0\n\nWith hindsight I have had: 1. A bit of stubborn stupidity or naivite. 2. A strong creative drive and big ego. 3. A big social network and quite a lot of social capital \u00a04. Low cost of living \u00a05. Free education and access to student grants and loans 6. Emotional support from friends and or family.\n\n\u00a0\n\n</div>\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2011-12-08 11:15:49", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:08.123107", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 955, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10103, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2434, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>What can we do together?</b>\n\nWell, welcome, everybody!

In your project, here are some things you might use:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>hexayurts</strong>. Invented by edgeryder Vinay Gupta (goes by [hexayurt] here), they represent a simple, efficient, sustainable, beautiful solution to the problem of providing cheap housing in many different sizes. In <a href=\"http://youtu.be/9CTCrWNYGTE\">this video</a> Vinay himself explains the logic.</li>\n\n<li><strong>mesh networks</strong>. We tend to think that access to information \u2013 hence connectivity \u2013 is fundamental in the development of a local community. Mesh networks are local networks you can build from very little and use them to share Internet connectivity. [elf Pavlik] is currently involved in building one for the Italian city of Matera, as his project in the <a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315\">unMonastery</a>\u00a0(<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/86762252\">video</a>).</li>\n\n<li><strong>solar trackers</strong>. Are you going to use solar panels? [Marc] is prototyping a 100% open hardware and open software <a href=\"/t/open-source-solar-tracker/355\">system</a> to let panels rotate following the sun. This increases their yield by as much as 40%.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li><strong>biochar rocket stoves</strong>. The idea is to burn small pieces of wood, producing charcoal that can be used as a soil amendment. Do you guys think you might have some use for something like this?\u00a0<a href=\"/t/forest-biochar-rocket-stove/343\">This</a> is still a prototype \u2013 [Darren] will be able to tell you more.</li>\n\n<li><strong>OpenStreetMap</strong>. It's great to be able to map the terrain. Once the map is there, you can create as many thematic layers as you want (for example, a map of cultivars, or a map of water sources). Google does typically not cover rural Africa well, but there is an open source alternative called OpenStreetMap. In this community there are several people who have a lot of experience with OSM and a lot of standing in its community, notably [napo] and [simonecortesi].\u00a0</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nWould you be interested in any of these? If so, let me tell you what could conceivably happen: your center in Uganda could become a place where we (collectively) learn how to deal with community owned- and managed assets. This is now interesting for Europeans: as the state retreats from some areas of service provision, people need to come up with the skills to build and maintain common assets. The UK in particular is looking hard in this direction \u2013 [CommonFutures] is specially active in this are. So, the Ugandan experience could become a place from which we in Europe could learn more.

Start Bootstrapping</b>\n\nIncreasingly I am becoming fed up of the waste of time and energy involved in the social entrepreneur \"pitching\" model. Pitching, either to VCs or to investors, or to grant-makers, can dissipate valuable time and energy. Competitions, often led by public-sector organisations, are the same thing in disguise. These processes leave you out of control of the process, waiting, hoping, that someone else will give the green light to your idea.\n\nHere's a radical thought: give yourself the green light. Start. Now.\n\nBut of course - some social innovation ideas simply REQUIRE a significant capital investment to get started. The answer? Change your idea. This may mean a wholesale redesign - in the case, for example, of wanting to set up a community steelworks, unfortunately, you need a steelworks. These things are expensive, and they aren't susceptible to cottage industry production. In that case, junk the idea and get another one. A community clothing bank, or even community steel recycling, may be much more feasible.\n\nBut it may just mean adjusting the idea - and thinking about development over time, rather than \"full on, right from the start\". Even better, by thinking like this it enables the nascent idea to build capabilities and capacities, so as things get rolling, you actually know how to deliver at a level only just below the scale you're asked to deliver at now.\n\nMany social enterprise ideas ARE susceptible to bootstrapping. Is there a way that, on a small scale, your idea can generate a small income this week? Maybe just a handful of Euros? Okay, with that reinvested, can it generate a few more Euros next week? And the week after a few more? This is bootstrapping - pulling your idea up by its own bootstraps.\n\nIn a time of crisis, when risk-taking investment (either public or private) is virtually non-existent, or (possibly worse) comes with hampering strings attached, this is the only way. Crowdfunding, which in these cases is often simply \"pre-ordering\", is a great way to unlock this. Some friends of ours raised \u00a372000 IN THREE DAYS through Kickstarter - essentially what they did was to cut out the funder, cut out the VC, and head direct for their future customers.\n\nWe have to start looking for early income generation to move forward. And this, it seems to me, is what distinguishes social entrepreneurship from the old model of grant funding (and its bastard child: delivering public services outsourced to the voluntary sector).\n\nSo, what if your model is not designed to make income? In that case, it's NOT A SOCIAL ENTERPRISE IDEA. It may be very laudable, and may well be very effective - but it's not the same thing.\n\nSummary: if we are going to pitch, then it should be pitching to customers - not pitching to third parties who have a strange (often exploitative) relationship with the value networks developed.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-03-26 23:51:34", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:19.509705", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 509, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 170.8, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 5, 98, 3791], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11588, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 6657, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Sorry to hear this :(</b>\n\nIs there anything that can be done from outside Egypt to help?

The community seems to consistently find similar issues important. Whether that stems from the fact that these kinds of observations appeared first and inspired similar posts, or if these issues are just universally important to the community remains to be seen (and I\u2019d love to hear your theories!). New threads are constantly emerging as well, dovetailing with existing stories and painting an even richer picture of the ways people care for one another in our current precarious climate. So I\u2019ll outline a few important connections that I\u2019ve seen so far. Some loci of conversations are as follows:\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">1. Resilience in the face of Crisis</h3>\n\nCrisis has been a key theme throughout our time together, whether it be the financial crisis in countries like Greece or the refugee crisis that has led to mass migration. Community members have been thinking up all kinds of ways to maintain resilience, trying to balance preservation of old ways of life (like neighbourhoods, or safeguarding the elderly\u2019s stores of valuable knowledge) while being open to new community members arriving from other shores (through intercultural exchange, and overcoming language barriers). The interesting thing to me as an ethnographer has been the ways in which, even though the two efforts at first glance may seem opposite (protecting against and embracing change), the same strategies are being used. Bringing strangers together through the fostering of social events or the creation of shared public space, making spaces for education and skill sharing \u2013 these are the ways that communities in crisis band together and show solidarity for one another.\n\nCrisis also comes in the form of precarity: decreased opportunities for employment/labour, rising housing prices, and our youth seeing a lack of a future for themselves. These kinds of crises have been answered by community-based care, the umbrella for so many interactions that have been documented on Open Care: through co-habitation, skill-sharing and skill-building, building or repurposing space for living, and many other creative living arrangements. Places are at the heart of communities, whether those places be neighbourhoods or homes, cities or rural areas. It has been exciting to see connections across disparate geographical terrains present (sharing drugs across national borders, or online support groups), and international networks coming into being --- these have lead people to meet up offline, and to strengthen the spaces in which they live and work. Despite claims that the internet is radically removing the need for place, offline spaces remain crucially important to communities in Open Care.\n\nCrisis takes another form as well: climate change and pollution have created concerns among community members, prompting the need for greater resilience in the face of natural disasters and environmental disruptions, and creating sustainable solutions has been a key factor in a lot of conversations across topics.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">2. Mental Health and Alternative Living</h3>\n\nIt is perhaps unsurprising with the presence of crisis, precarity, and widespread displacement that mental health issues have come to the fore. Trauma is rife after such experiences, and community members have been trying to find ways to heal themselves mentally as well as physically. Self-care has been a theme, though it has been made clear that going it alone is not a viable option in many circumstances. We need each other to get through, although no one can do it for us. This theme has also shown that sometimes people do need trained professionals---- there is a limit to how much peers can help in certain medical situations. But since holistic healthcare is so important to so many members of the community, trained professionals are only one aspect of mental healthcare. In dealing with trauma especially, connecting people in different places, sharing support and resources, has been crucial. Some people have found group therapy and online support groups useful, while others have found that alternative therapies like meditation and acupuncture help them get through. Gardening can be the key to happiness and healing sometimes, it seems, as can artistic expression!\n\nPart of the reason that Open Carers are so inspiring is their commitment to living life a little differently. Many community members have identified sources of stress that emerge from trying to measure success by someone else\u2019s metric, or taking on expectations at work that far exceed or are completely different from their own desires. Sometimes mental health issues come from sources we can\u2019t fight--- depression results from a chemical imbalance in the brain, after all --- but some sources are identifiable, and community members have been inventing creative ways of attaining happiness even in the diciest of situations. There is a powerful link, it seems, between creating a life in which someone is able to express themselves creatively and finding mental well-being.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">3. Autonomy and Interdependency</h3>\n\nAnother interesting tension. OpenCarers have a strong desire for autonomy:\u00a0 to be independent from failing systems, to be mobile on their own, to be self-sufficient even when in a liminal space like a refugee camp, to be treated like adults by their governments and public services, to have the power to effect change in their worlds, and so on. Myriad design interventions have addressed mobility issues, allowing people to regain control over their motor functions. Other initiatives have promoted, through skill-sharing and education, the ability of refugees to be self-sufficient despite unfavourable circumstances and temporary living situations. It feels good to be in control of one\u2019s own life, it seems, instead of being at the mercy of institutions that often don\u2019t consult people about what they want and how they care to live.\n\nThat being said, communities are interdependent and proud of it. They support each other, share resources, build common spaces, and teach each other new skills. More importantly, they believe this should be the case: communities should be at the heart of health and social care practices, according to OpenCarers. Resilient communities are those that celebrate their interdependency and care for one another, while also allowing each other to flourish in their own individual ways. How to achieve this balance has been an ongoing topic of conversation, since it is not only the collapse of public systems that has troubled Open Carers, but the collapse of informal support systems like extended family units and vibrant communities as well. How do we take care of our communities and strengthen informal ties in the face of increasing collapse of formal systems of care? Or, perhaps the better question is how to improve both, since OpenCarers seem deeply committed to improving both forms of care.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">4. Issues of Legality, Regulation, and Safety when working Outside Existing Systems</h3>\n\nIt is perhaps unsurprising, given the goal of Open Care, that we have heard so many stories about people working at the margins of or outside existing systems. Questions here (when it comes to design interventions especially) rotate around the twin spokes of legality and safety. A community member will ask something along these lines: how can we get around stringent regulations that stop people, usually people without resources like money or the ability to travel, from accessing vital medical interventions? Then, generally, another community member will bring up the issue of safety, especially around clinical trials. These regulations are there for a reason, the community member(s) argue back, to keep people safe from harm. So collectively, the community has generated this more nuanced question: how do we work outside existing systems to give people access to vital technologies of care, while also keeping them safe? The answer seems to lie in self-regulation, in ethics and ethical commitments to good, safe practice. Making rules for spaces is another way in which this happens, as people collectively agree on best practices. Open processes are another way this is managed, with commitments to open notebook science, Open Source and Open Hardware, which maintain transparency and keep everyone honest and accountable.\n\nFinally, working outside existing systems is not always the path chosen by Open Carers. Many community-based care initiatives look to work with policy-makers, or form public-private partnerships, to realise their visions or get the resources they need to deliver them to the people who need them. The desire to rejuvenate urban spaces and revitalise neighbourhoods has been a key space of collaboration between different stakeholders. Change in each case is needed, but the implementation of that change can take different forms depending on the issues at hand.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">5. Egalitarian Ideals</h3>\n\nFinally, the community as a whole has a strong commitment to egalitarianism, whether it be in the form of cooperative living, transparent and flat governance, distribution of resources, maintaining open processes, fighting against corrupting of corporate greed, or creating alternatives to existing systems of inequality. How to manage equality while also creating systems that work and are effective has been an ongoing topic of conversation, and I imagine will continue to be. How do we make rules for spaces and enact shared governance while being fair to everyone? How do we overcome and/or reform systems that seem hell-bent on perpetuating inequality?\n\nIn closing, I am really looking forward to compiling a list of research questions that the community have generated so we can see the key issues at stake in the future of these projects. Stay tuned!\n\n(Question: I had plans to hyperlink this post to all the stories that brought it into being, phrase by phrase, but I ultimately worried that it would be too busy/hard to read.

So far, so good - some of our discoveries and achievements are overwhelmingly good and promising. Just to give you a short overview:\n\n1. We got in touch with Kharkhana and N-Hackers Nepal, which soon led us to intense exchange and project planning. The story is that I wrote to Raspberry Pi's offices and asked if they would like to join the project somehow by giving us some of their goodies - they responded enthusiastically and immediately sent us three berries with some extras. We had to decide how we could use them, and here <a href=\"http://www.karkhana.asia/\">Karkhana</a> turned out being super helpful, connecting us with <a href=\"http://tunein.com/radio/Radio-Nepal-792-s17747/\">RAN, Robotics Association of Nepal</a>. Sunoj, the president of RAN, met me on Skype and soon all moved very fast. I had my room sorted for the first nights above their office. We decided to organise a call and develop three interesting projects with any geeky person who'd like to play with Berries. Moreover, there is a milk-measuring-related hackathon in plans and some other interesting events, in which Egderyders might turn out to be at hand. So exciting.\n\n2. First ideas and proposals from people who we know and who are around the place at the moment (meaning, somewhere in Asia) are already there - it needs still some logistics and planning, but if all goes well, the support group will look even better than we ever dreamt of. This is also where I should remind everyone - there will be space, and we welcome everyone to come by, stay with us and ideally, come with a great small (or big) project idea.\n\n3. We prepared a<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o0nBqxNaooV_IwhLM7bCQptjJJqfTKzrGTOj4W-svVE/edit#heading=h.9edpnq3sbfj\"> plan for our stay and project</a>, which can be viewed here. Any comments, ideas, recommendations or variations are welcome.\n\n4. I am doing a little bit of a chaotic research about the country and its history, culture, politics. What I have found varies from stories of<a href=\"http://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-documentaries-on-Nepal\"> Sky Caves</a> in Mustang region (somewhat a similar phenomena to this of Matera, with extremely old civilization inhabiting a system of caves, extremely sophisticated inner-mountain highrises), to various hippie memorials of how Europeans and Americans ended up settling down in Nepal decades ago, to <a href=\"http://tunein.com/radio/Radio-Nepal-792-s17747/\">Nepali radio stations</a> (trying to find one I'd like to listen to when I am there, for now I am impressed by the mix of English and Nepali used on the \"popular\" stations) and finally to recordings of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbBFSLugqv0\">Gunla festival </a>which we will probably be lucky to participate in in July, with the traditional Gunla Bajan music presented. My favorite thing so far is this DIY feminist anarchist punk goodie - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Li0ntSIHY-E&amp;list=RDkz-PQVeqdy4&amp;index=2\">Tank Girl</a>, side project of another iconic band Rai Ko Ris from Kathmandu, unfortunately at this moment in hiatus.

They report on a proposal that had already been made and never realized. It seems that they are imagining a citywide policy. Also it seems they are discouraged.\n\n* This point is of particular interest as it evokes different key-issues related to Opencare:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\texpectations of citizen/participants towards the local administration</li>\n\n<li>\tthe relationship between product/service/policy</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nAt the end, two macro groups are formed. One is interested in the \u201cWarning\u201d issue. The other one chooses \u201cphysical barriers\u201d to mobility.

Yesterday we re-exported the data, including @Amelia 's annotations (careful! only a very partial coding so far), and Guy built a rough visualization of the whole people-to-content-to-codes network:\u00a0\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/0/0618fbdd85b1abebb7de37de6ea3551e97051762.jpeg\" width=\"690\" height=\"407\">\n\nZooming in, you see:\u00a0\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/acf2478ddbcccc35628c915a34193f779ed186e7.jpeg\" width=\"690\" height=\"468\">\n\nBeautiful... but overwhelming.\n\nSo here is what happens.\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Jason is already quite advanced in building a navigation interface. The idea is this: you start from a graph representation, and then you follow the various links, from ethno code to people and their content. For example: start with a code you are interested in, say \"refugees\", and see other codes it might be connected to, for example \"France\". Click on the edge between \"refugees\" and \"France\" to find content that is coded with both codes, like @Alex_Levene 's <a href=\"/t/care-on-the-camp-a-calais-story/503\">beautiful posts</a> on The Jungle.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>The problem we are facing is how to filter this mass of information so that the (human) analyst is not sidetracked into relatively unimportant things (unless she wants to be). So we have to come up at filtering techniques.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>We decided the right place to start is the code-to-code\u00a0graph. But that is also overwhelming: even this early in the study, Amelia identified 460 tags, connected by 5,116 co-occurrence edges. And back to the question above: how to filter it?</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nBelow you can see our first shot. The scatterplot shows co-occurrences of ethno codes. On the x-axis, we have the number of co-occurrences (edge force); on the y-axis, we have the number of\u00a0<em>different</em>\u00a0users who authored contributions that host that co-occurrence.\u00a0\n\nExample. Suppose the co-occurrence of \u00a0\"refugees\" and \"France\" has x = 5 and y = 3. This means that in opencare there are 5 posts or comments, authored by 3 different users, that have\u00a0<em>both</em>\u00a0the \"refugees\"\u00a0<em>and</em>\u00a0the \"France\" tags.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/57176aecc98184b499fc7e5ea5a1bd7faf20a0d1.jpeg\" width=\"569\" height=\"500\">\n\nWe used the scatterplot to reduce the code-code graph, selecting only the codes that co-occur at least twice, by at least two different users. This is now much more readable: 180 codes, with 678 edges. We plotted it below:\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f4a5dc5da5c2087a45ccd126c0bfd9a7813fc352.jpeg\" width=\"686\" height=\"500\">\n\nAt this point, you can start to explore the graph. It's quite a beautiful experience. I see it as exploring someone's association pattern, except \"someone\" is not an individual, but\u00a0<em>the whole opencare community.\u00a0</em>\u00a0It's, well collective intelligence!\u00a0\n\nFor example, look at the codes co-occurring with \"mental health\":\u00a0\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/4/4e975d5be65afcecb41d5dc39ee9e367c7f3ac00.jpeg\" width=\"649\" height=\"500\">\n\nThe community is saying there is a strong connection between migration, trauma and mental health. It is tempting to interpret this as an indication of priority: other things are surely important (eating disorders, for example), but <em>these</em>\u00a0connections, and not others,\u00a0are\u00a0top of mind.\n\nAnother example: youth.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/2/2150b474ceb5a763d4c797815148a76ca732b63e.jpeg\" width=\"690\" height=\"494\">\n\nVery clear: you see the problems (housing, resource strain, discrimination) and the strategies deployed to face them (creative living arrangements, migration, skill sharing).\u00a0\n\nWe can go much further. In\u00a0fact,\u00a0we\u00a0already are. We can now induce the social network\u00a0\n\nSo, I think we have a very, very promising research methodology on our hand. But we also have questions for Amelia. There are codes we do not understand, like \"research-question\" and \"case-study\". They would make sense as meta-codes, categories of codes, but they are not, they are directly associated to snippets of texts.\u00a0I guess doing open notebook ethnography, with people like me asking questions even while you still are coding, is more difficult! :-)\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-10-22 14:21:06", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 11:43:39.810572", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 820, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 71.2, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3074, 2551, 3310], "is_private": false}, {"id": 820, "user_id": 3362, "topic_id": 787, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<em>This is the digital workspace\u00a0for coordination and discussion on the Belgian chapter of the Open Insulin project.

Many people in poorer communities or developing countries have no way of getting appropriate treatment for diabetes. This leads to <strong>serious ilnesses</strong> such as blindness, amputations, cardiovascular disease and ultimately coma or death.\n\nThere is <strong>no generic insulin</strong> on the market and prices are kept high by patent strategies of the\u00a0few companies that control the market. We're trying to change this by open sourcing the knowledge required to produce insulin.\n\nAs an obvious result this would allow production of <strong>cheaper insulin</strong> by generic suppliers. It might also enable <strong>home brewing</strong> of insulin or <strong>local microfactories</strong> in remote areas. Moreover, it can serve as a fertile soil for more open innovation and citizen science in research.\n\nStill, the scope of this project is <strong>narrowly defined</strong>: develop and validate a production method for insulin. Patient testing\u00a0and further engineering are not on the table before this important milestone.\n\nThe original <a href=\"/t/how-open-insulin-works-to-open-source-science-and-medicine/519\">Open Insulin</a> team from Counter Culture Labs started out by attempting to <strong>modify\u00a0<em>E. Coli</em> bacteria</strong> to produce the precursors of\u00a0human insulin, which has proven successful. Next steps are purification and turning it into human insulin.\n\nThe actual lab work is done locally and the open conversation takes place online.

I\u2019m summarizing some key points below:\n\nCan the commons paradigm constitute a shared agenda for change, at local, national, European level? Can it expand existing movements into majorities and build cross-movement collaboration and action?\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Movements which hold the promise of political mobilization and reformation:</h3>\n\n<strong>A.\u00a0</strong><strong>The Co-Operatives Movement</strong>: Employment in the co-operative movement -- at 250 million people \u2013 is actually larger today than that of multinational companies, membership is higher than in trade unions and political parties (p.5)\n\nTrends: polarization between small and big, new and historic co-ops; corporatization; elitism; loss of members\u2019 trust\n\nNew wave of coops: strong social ethic, yet lacking operational skills &amp; policy support; also lacking is focus on sustainability and environment\n\nOpportunities to create an aligned economically alternative movement:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>a new, open co-operativism based on a multistakeholder approach to support not just workers and consumers, but also investors and philantropists (FairShare model)</li>\n\n<li>commons based peer production models that would be independent from capital markets (Cooperativa Integral Catalana, Common Futures)</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>B.\u00a0</strong><strong>Social and Solidarity Economy:</strong> Advocates post-capitalist transformation putting people and the planet first. between 9% and 11.5% of economically active citizens in Sweden, Belgium, France, Holland and Italy work in Social and Solidarity Economy enterprises (p.12).\n\nThe strategic challenge for the solidarity economy is to build horizontal alliances and to\u00a0advance co-production and co-financing. (p.12)\n\nTrends &amp; opportunities: national lawmaking efforts to recognize and promote sustainable economy and build transformation agendas \u2013 eg fairer production chains, co-production and cooperation rather than competitiveness\n\n<strong>C.\u00a0</strong><strong>The Degrowth Movement</strong>: new language to approach \u201cthe economy\u201d and \u201cthe environment\u201d; abolishing economic growth as a social objective\n\nChallenges: unified agenda; Important concepts in the discourse of the degrowth movement include voluntary simplicity, sharing, social justice, conviviality, happiness, alternative indicators to GDP and appropriate scale technology.. (p.14)\n\n<strong>D.\u00a0</strong><strong>Peer Production: </strong>open/libre software for digital collaboration, publishing, mixing and remixing, open design, manufacturing etc.\n\nChallenges: invent new ways to enable it and self-reproduction over time, to break the logic of capitalism;\u00a0 \u201cnetarchical capitalism\u201d reaping the benefits and producing generalized crisis of precarity among contributors in open platforms, according to M. Bauwens from P2P Foundation (p.19)\n\nOpportunities: enables self organization, autonomy, resilience via interdependency of open networks\n\n<a href=\"http://commonstransition.org/a-new-alignment-of-movements-part-i-the-general-challenge/\">\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b6f48efc14fec77279ba146896f602017d9b2c2d.PNG\" width=\"690\" height=\"482\"><br></a>\n\n<strong>E.</strong><strong>The Sharing and Collaborative Economy: </strong>distinct fields of innovation according to B. Tincq from OuiShare \u2013 consumption, fabrication, knowledge, funding, governance, exchange systems\n\nVenture capital funding schemes are seen as some of the controversial bits of the movement, but on the up side there are also experiments in open value networks such as Sensorica to find the right balance.\n\nIn between there is a mix of non-profit and for profit driven approaches, like\u00a0 centralised production using local infrastructure: FabLabs and Makers spaces\n\nChallenges: sustainability and ownership issues involving communities; lack of a commons model; ecological effects posed by extraction of raw materials\n\n<strong>F.</strong><strong>The Commons Movement: </strong>self-organized groups of people can and do create systems of governance and management for their shared wealth, often outperforming bureaucratic systems and predatory markets (p.23);\n\nPermaculture, CSA, community land trusts, participatory budgeting, community currencies\n\nGoteo vision: \u201chacktivism + crowdfunding + wide social collaboration = the\u00a0building of new commons. \u201c\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Strategies for convergence</h3>\n\n\u201ceach movement seems to want to change the relationships between the state, market and civil society.\u201d -Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Sultan\n\nMajor obstacle seems to be the coordination costs between movements: \u201cexisting organizations don\u2019t have time to be part of collective discussions.

We make it clearer when we present the project at conferences and meetings, but the info on the site is very synthetic, I know.\n\nI worked for the last 9 years in the cultural field and met along the way different cultural operators, some involved in activities for children and youth as part as their core mission, some through their audience development goals. With time, I teamed up with people that knew how schools and teachers view the arts and their importance and we both realised their is potential for more quality and more activities here, and others that thought that there is room for more awareness of practices, more knowledge sharing, more debate, more quality. I graduated in cultural policy and had an interest in audience development and enlarging the audience for the arts and heritage among young people, buth as number and socio-economic profile.\n\nWhen in 2013 we got some funding to go to Norway from the EEA grants and find out about their programme, we were very happy and when we returned we presented to Romanian cultural operators and some educational specialists their approach with the Cultural Rucksack. We compared with other internationl approaches from Austria, Norway, France, the UK. They were all interested and eager to develop the professional community of arts in education in Romania as well, but adapted to our country's situation, not an imported model. That is how we grew the project idea, we discussed with practitioners and continued the discussion voluntarily for about a year with no funding, just because we say that networking was needed and appreciated.\n\nWe realised soon that what we need to do is not so much add to the pile of existing activities of arts in schools with some of our own, but connect, research, train, bring forward expertise of well trained and experienced arts in education professionals and start from there. Not do a Cultural Rucksack programme, but build the knowledge, sharing of practices and expertise among practicioners in Romania and explore how such a programme could work in Romania in the future. I believe that is the proper way to do policy transfer from one country to another, by analysis, debate and adaptation to the local national context. More so, the Cultural Rucksack in a government and county public authorities led-programme with lots of funding from the National Lottery, so a replica of it in Romania cannot work in the present or immediate future I would say.\n\nOur overall goal for the project is to promote quality cultural experiences in the lives of more children in youth in Romania in a shared partnership between the arts professionals and schools.\n\nOur main activities are:\n\n- a training component for aprox 200 teachers, artistic and cultural professionals (10 trainings for 2 different target groups that learn to collaborate: cultural professional and educational professionals)\n\n- monthly meetings on relevant topics relates to arts in education practices and philosophy\n\n- an arts in education archive (work in progress) documenting the most important and inspiring projects from the last 10 years in Romania &amp; a book of interviews with their founders\n\n- several analysis and reports, one being a comparative one about arts in education programmes in Europe (we have a Nrowegian expert, that has managed the Cultural Rucksack for 10 years as part of the team that works on this report)\n\n- a contact sheet ans presentation of organisations that can be considered resources in Romania for NGOs and schools that want to do arts in education activities\n\n- an advocacy component, that is now in preparation\n\n- an international workshop and conference in April 2016\n\n- communication via the Facebook group and hopefully more sharing of info and experiences soon via the website and the forum.\u00a0\n\nIn short, this is our project, these are our activities, we are 5 organisations partnering up to do the work, with 12 trainers coming from the arts and educational world and other 4 key experts from the museum world, arts world, theatre university and research in educational sciences.\u00a0\n\nI guess that the type of network we aim to develop is a community of professionals (people and organisations) with practices in the field. I do not claim that what we do is perfect, we started from some activities, we lack others, we would love better communication, but we have to prioritize, and we decided to communicate online a bit less and meet directly, train, analyse and document a bit more, at least in this phase. We are building up the project. It is hard, I am sure you know that from your own experiences :) We are happy to have a grant from the NGO Fund (again, EEA grants). We worry what will happen when it ends, what will follow, what we will be able to do next. We do what we can for this purpose, any support is welcomed, do write to us at contact@culturaineducatie.ro for more information, suggestions, ideas, proposals for collaboration.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-21 18:35:55", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:52.603355", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 917, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2580], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19381, "user_id": 72, "topic_id": 1570, "post_number": 10, "raw": "<b>Outstanding Math teacher?</b>\n\nA couple of math teachers discussing one of Khans videos.

These are a few ingredients of some green houses built outside the cities.

Recently, they have inaugurated an education center, which has a ramp made of casings instead of a wall, recycled furniture and different kinds of technologies. These are helping them consume less energy than the solar panels integrated into the permaculture garden based on the roof produce.\n\nBut they are not the only ones dreaming with their eyes open about sustainable houses, self-sufficient households and circular cities. They are joined by Flavia Matei, a young architect moved to Austria, but back for a short time in the country. She\u2019s here again to build a <a href=\"https://acasainrosia.wordpress.com/\">house from earth bricks</a> with the members of a deprived community from Ro\u0219ia, Sibiu.\n\n@Iulian_Ifrim is also a part of the \u201ccrazy\u201d people\u2019s club who think that it\u2019s not impossible to build a \u201cgreenish\u201d house. Consultant in social businesses, Iulian moved one year ago from Bucharest to a village near Sibiu. There, together with his wife, he started building a house as sustainable as possible.\n\nNone of the ones who had this courage chose an intravilan land. The reason is simple, they say: under the cautious eyes of the authorities from cities, they could never get the construction approvals.\n\nInstead of the foundation, Marius and Felicia used on their new construction some huge screws, which are fixed in the ground and hold the structure. For the walls, they used lamellar wood, produced by gluing some panels made of timber of different measures and they did the insulation with wool and cellulose. Instead of the wall from the left side of the house, they built a ramp of old casings, filled with soil, which they finally covered with grass. This way, they wanted to offer stability to the building, but also an insulation more efficient. The ramp lets you climb on the roof, where they arranged a garden, based on the principles of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture\">permaculture</a>.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/c/cc9fa56116c9b4d09ad3cbcc4a6ce731319871be.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"430\">\n\nFlavia started the construction from Ro\u0219ia helped by unqualified workers, even with the final beneficiaries of the work. She let them mistake and she helped them repair them. They built the foundation using river rock and concrete, the walls \u2013 made of soil bricks and straws, and the plaster \u2013 made of soil. The roof is of wood and the insulation \u2013 made of reed collected from the closely riverbed. They insulated the floor with glasses of glass and instead of the plywood, they used recycled paletts. At first, the locals were laughing at them because they were building a house made of cheap materials. But when they were shown the bricks and they realized that they are extremely strong, they started being curious. In the end, the beneficiaries will have not only a house, but also the respect of their neighbors.\n\nBecause of the phreatic line, found at a very high level, Iulian Ifrim used a classical structure for the first level of the building. He did the foundation with concrete and the masonry with bricks. But upstairs, where the water can\u2019t get, he chose some traditional technics from Moldova. He used pillars of acacia, which he \u201cfilled\u201d with a mixture of clay, straws and water. The plaster will be done with sand and lime, which will allow him to not use more insulation. For the loft he used wood and the roof is made of manual tiles.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/91988ee16af8b031445db42482aa0fbf9b3cffb9.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"348\">\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\">Green houses, discouraged by the legislation</h2>\n\nIn general, the reason why the pioneers of the sustainable houses choose to build outside the cities is simple. The authorisation of construction is easier to get and the verifications \u2013 less strict. \u201cNo inspector from the city would sign for a building with unconventional stuff\u201d, say some of the prime movers of the constructions. Even though the solutions are friendly with the environment and very old, they are considered too risky for the residents of the nowadays society.\n\nDorin Beu, the president of Romanian Green Building Council, explained the caution of the authorities:\n\n\u201cThe purpose is not to stop you (sustainable building), but you can\u2019t let people have the construction falling of on their heads\u201d. He recommended to those interested to search abroad for solutions \u00a0to experiment with and which respect the law. Beu believes that, in time, the authorities will allow the alternative buildings too and the sector will grow until it will get at an industrial level. Otherwise, he says, it won\u2019t be sustainable.\n\nThe RoGBC president militates for the use of some good quality materials, to prevent the deterioration and to extend their lifetime. Also, he supports the modern technologies\u2019 integration alongside with the traditional ones, for the energetic streamline of the buildings, but also the adaptation of the contructions to the local context and to the impact of the climate changes.\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\">Green houses, a part of the cities and of the circular economy</h2>\n\nThe debate about circular cities and green houses was held within an event organized at Sibiu. It took place\u00a0on the 10th June 2016, with the occasion of the Open Source Circular Economy Days international event.\n\nThe participants\u2019 conclusion was that nobody has a perfect recipe for a sustainable house. They agreed that exactly the multitude of solutions will determine the authorities to support the alternative constructions. Until then, it looks like the best is that the pioneers find wickets in the legislation and profit from them.\n\n<em>This article has been translated into English by Andra Pop\u00a0from an original piece on\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.green-report.ro/casele-verzi-expulzate-din-orase/\">Green Report Romania</a>.</em>\n\n", "created_at": "2016-07-04 09:22:42", "updated_at": "2018-06-17 00:55:47.206421", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1190, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 96.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30785, "user_id": 1003, "topic_id": 5949, "post_number": 32, "raw": "<b>nothing teorethical at all</b>\n\nI'm not a researcher, I'm a practitioner.\u00a0\n\nThere's nothing meta in my comment.

Though,\u00a0it might be\u00a0a good read for those who need a brief introduction into economics.\n\nHere is a brief story of my still failing attempt to start and use very basic,\u00a0banal elementary barter.\n\nI'm very banal and pragmatic about this. The elements of barter I use on FB have been sometimes very helpful, but I believe it can work better and respond to more needs.\u00a0I live in a condominium with relatively well off neighbours, but not so well off any longer, because of... well, you know. They have a lot of shit in the cellar which, I can see, no one\u00a0have\u00a0been using\u00a0for at least 3 years. Some of it I\u00a0wouldn't mind borrowing and using, and I'm sure I have some stuff that they can borrow or exchange.\u00a0\n\nAssumption that they want to clean up their cellars is still just an assumption, though based on observation (people trying to pile up and fit more and more stuff in their tiny storage rooms) And the assumption that my neighbours have less and less cash to spend comes from...hm, semi structured interviews :) Same, chats\u00a0with random inhabitants of the condo showed that they like the idea, but send me to the condo authorities...\n\nBarter seems to be \"not a tradition\" and so far I didn't manage to engage people to clean up their cellars and help each other to spend money only on stuff which is not already there.\n\nReasons for that might be:\u00a0\n\n1. Historical: people over here have a strong connection to legal\u00a0authorities and weak horisontal connections. So in order to make this swap shop happen I had\u00a0to talk to whatever chairman of the condominium, so they can put it in a monthly condominium letter. And we\u00a0seem to talk in different language...\u00a0They think I want to make flea-market or something like that and that it will take to much time and hassle. And it will look like shit in the yard, and that if someone visits the condo to buy a flat here they will think it's full off gypsies.\u00a0\n\n2. Idenity-related (also partly historical)\u00a0Showing that you are not so well off and rather swap something than spending more money is a challenge for identity. Identity in a sense \"Good citizen visits IKEA and buys new stuff\" and \"Bartering cultures are cultures of the uncivilised\"\n\n3. Squeamishness related: it might be that people don't like using stuff which have been used by someone else. Nevertheless, there are 3 second hand stores a block away which are always full (ok, it's for charity, though this charities been lately very controversial: church-homophobia&amp;union busting).\n\n4. Practical: the idea that this low range bartering will take more time than shopping. Or the fact that small scale barter cannot satisfy all the needs and you will still need to buy stuff.\n\nMy next step with this experiment is to present it to the condominium authorities in a clean digital format. I'm not a techie, so I'll show them a wordpress gallery and see what they think. I just feel discouraged a bit, and a bit uncivilised: I don;t knowif it is completely useless and I;m the only one interested or I am just going against normativity, which is totally fine and can be useful.\n\nHalf of stuff we have at home was given to us. The difference is that it was given by friends and aquaintances - in this case\u00a0gift is a normativity. Though it was a pain in the neck\u00a0to coordinate this gift transaction\u00a0and to transport gifts from another side of the town. So I'm just puzzled, why is it so hard to start swaping things where you live? Is that most people here need to become extremely poor to recognise the value of adding barter to their everyday consumption?\n\nWhy in\u00a0some cases it is working (student houses for example, and this barter FB group I'm using-\u00a0but these cases are limited, and that's why they satisfy very little needs)\n\nIt seems to be again, question of normativity and tradition. Sorry if it all sounded like some sort of arm-chair philosophical rant, that what it is, by the way.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-09-21 11:20:19", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:15.032312", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 804, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [12789], "is_liked_by": [1504], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29686, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 4623, "post_number": 15, "raw": "<b>Looks great!</b>\n\nThanks so much <a href=\"/u/elena_oglinda\">@Elena_Oglinda</a>!

During our last meeting Nadia proposed healthcare. Since in Europe\u00a0healthcare is public, not for-profit, increasing the speed of innovation and making it more efficient makes a lot of sense. In\u00a0<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BzrQyEif2HItRDZMZTVRSVdURTQ/edit\">Quantifying the Value of Open Source Hardware Development</a>\u00a0, Joshua Pearce from Michigan Tech University shows how open source benefits science by reducing the costs of scientific instruments. This can be\u00a0easily\u00a0transposed to the\u00a0healthcare context. I also know that a lot of similar papers have been published about how open source software reduces costs and keeps spending on maintenance within the local economy.\u00a0\n\nWhen we talk about open source hardware or software we talk about open source innovation. I call that non-institutionalized innovation, or innovation by the crowd or the people. This leads to the PPP concept, a departure from public-private partnership to public-private-people partnership. We cannot ignore this third pillar in modern innovation, the people, the open source mode of innovation. The problem is that the people side is still not\u00a0officially\u00a0and formally recognized and it is way underfunded. There are also forces that try to keep the \"people\" side of the equation under the rug, because innovation that comes through this channel displaces innovation that comes from the private channel, which can be monetized by corporations. \u00a0Example, South Africa has a law to favor open source software for government, which is not enforced due to pressures from Microsoft [see <a href=\"http://www.infoworld.com/article/2675897/operating-systems/south-africa-taps-open-source-to-boost-local-it.html\">THIS post</a> and <a href=\"http://www.itnews.com.au/News/360178,south-african-schools-forced-down-microsoft-path.aspx\">THIS post</a>\u00a0- I can look for better sources, I had one, but lost the link]. So even if you make a law that makes sense, because it reduces installation costs and all the money for maintenance stays into your local economy, the system takes time to change because this measure goes against private interest.\u00a0\n\nMichel Bauwens also speaks about PPP (public-private-people partnership) and the\u00a0<a href=\"http://p2pfoundation.net/Partner_State\">partner state</a>.\n\nBut since we are in\u00a0healthcare, I think the pressure to reduce costs is enormous, because of the demographics in conjunction with shrinking budgets.

And I was coming from a background recently working with Transparency International Georgia and before that media organizations. When I joined JumpStart it was because of the technology and community approach the organization was involved in; I thought it was brilliant this idea of community mapping.\n\nHowever, when I joined the mapping came to an end, and JumpStart sort of was in a crisis mode. We had all this capacity, technical capacity, but we didn't know what to do. We weren't funded to do mapping. We had a pretty long transition period for about a year and a half. We worked from project to project to make ends meet, which I hated, because I don't think organizations should exist to put food on people's table. <strong>An NGOs job is to put itself out of business.</strong>\n\nA lot of the old staff left. During the mapping period we had around 1000 people, directly or through community involvement, to rely on and we went down to 5 or 6 people. Which was interesting.\n\nBut in 2012 this idea popped into my head. This was the result of mapping. Mapping is the ultimate form of visualization. It is easy to see a map that has massive amount of data in small place and you are able to interpret it and make decisions based on that information. And I don't know a lot of visuals that can have that level of complexity and be that intuitive for people to understand. So I started thinking about other ways and other environments in which visualizations could have an impact. At this time I came across some data journalism blogs.\n\nWhat really dawned on me was the intersection of important social issues, technology, visualizations, and impact. When I looked around our local context of that time which was just Georgia, I was disappointed to see how little progressive journalists and NGOs here were. NGOs would spending months and put out reports that no one would ever read. You do 12 months of research and you write your report and it's gone. It really pissed me off that the knowledge was gone. And I thought there needs to be an alternative.\n\nSo we started visualizing Georgia with local news, small things. For me it was a way, from my perspective, crucial to communicate in issues and increasing engagement. Which was an ultimate goal which I thought it was something many NGOs were striving for but were falling short of.\n\nAt that time, it was mainly just my colleague here, Jason and I, and I hired one journalist for this project, and at that time we had only one designer working for us half time. I hired a journalist, Nino Macharashvili, she just came from university, so she didn't have any baggage, and had an entrepreneurial mindset. So we got funded by OSF to do a small experiment in 2012. And this was amazing, we got to explore so many things. And this for me is like, the crux of engagement and getting the community involved.\n\nJust exploring new things and to see how it works and being able to do it. Open Society at that time was open to this. We were very fortunate. We were exploring all kinds of visualizations, we started with infographics, but continued with different things, more interactive, a variety of different things. This is when it clicked. And it had huge impact. NGOs saw what we did and wanted to do it to. They didn't even know it was us, we created http://feradi.info (feradi = colorful information). NGOs were calling 'feradi' to do work for them. And I would show up and they said aren't you JumpStart? That was funny.\n\nWe continued to do our own work but we started working with these NGOs, to see their approach how they are working, and how we could assist them. For us, we explored and learned a lot, but we also developed good workflows and how to work with technology in general.\n\nIt is not an easy thing to do, to meet deadlines and be efficient at doing it; it can get away from you quite easily.\n\nMost NGOs wanted to do the visualizations but didn't want to learn the process, they just said: do it. But that is not something what we do or want.\n\n<strong>So we work with data, not only maps, but all kinds of data and visualize them, our goal is to create platforms, tools, etc. and speaks to target audiences in a useful way and engage them about issues that are important.</strong>\n\nFor the past couple of years we've worked on a variety of subjects, health \u2013 hepatitis C \u2013 contraception \u2013 abortion, to election data, to election data mismanagement, there is so many things we've done - noise pollution, domestic violence, air quality, you name it. Not unlike any media organization, we work on so many issues. I think in the process what we've done also is really sort of understood what the data landscape is, basically, what is the the catalog of data in the country and how can we exploit it and leverage it to improve communication around issues that people need to know about.\n\nAnd simultaneously we do now a lot of trainings with organizations on a variety of subjects: data journalism, data analysis, all things that we've become quite good at.\n\nAnd finally, we've build a lot of tools that enable people to do things that they can't.\n\nWe are a small organization, we can't really compete with organizations like Tableau Public, but what we've done is create a number of tools that have a fixed target audience that fill a gap that isn't currently filled. We've built <a href=\"http://storybuilder.jumpstart.ge/en\">StoryBuilder</a> last year to enable people to do log form mixed media stories, and that was very successful, and its being used all over the world. Every day there are new stories on it.\n\n<strong>One of the key things, and this is true for all our products, they are all free and open source. We host our own version, but we make the platform available to others to install.</strong>\n\nAnd this is important to me.\n\nA friend of mine explained it once: I think people should be treated equally and should have equal access to everything, and this can be extended quite far into a lot of areas. Resource equality, economic equality, education equality, safety, legal protection equality; it can be a lot of things, and I don't think a lot of people and organizations really understand what this means. A lot of people want equal access to public information, but they don't get to decide what is public, so it's not equal.\n\nSome groups decide what is public and open, but that is not equal, you get access to all things in the vending machine, but we don't choose what goes into the vending machine. From a data perspective I think that's important. Equal access to decision makers, equal influence of decision making, it can be extended to so many things, property, clean water. And I think in general, the work that people do should strive so that people everywhere have equal access to all these things so that they're not unequal distributed among them, where elites with small percentages get advantage over vast majorities of population. That for me is quite unacceptable.\n\nIt also leads to quite a lot of negative consequences in society that also impact that elite, which is violence, revolution, high swings and cycles of increase and depression, so this is my little rant, but in general, the more we strive to provide as much as possible too as many people as possible in general we are all better of, we can make better decisions, we can choose for ourselves have control of ourselves, our families, the people that matter.\n\nAt JumpStart this manifests through access to information, and we encourage people to share information. And, unfortunately, within the civil society we see here so much competition for economic resources that are finite, and of course in economics they say all resources are finite, everybody is trying to get their hands on resources that are finite, that's what generates a discrepancy between demand and supply, and then ultimately have and have not's. But I think, NGOs they are fighting for a finite list of funding to remain viable, and they see their assets, which they see as the information that they have and they hord that capacity. We see a lot of survey data that is silo'd in NGOs, but also the public sector.\n\nThe perfect example is the Public Registry of Georgia: they hord the data and they SELL the data to people and organizations that can afford it, that gives unequal access and capacity and advantages on decision making and a whole range of issues. Such as economic advantages, because if you can access data on that level that the public registry has and analyze it, you can make economic decision that are far more informed than people who don't have that access to that data. And that is an economic advantage. The information the public registry has is collected with public money. That is huge and the government has set it up so it is an entity of public law, it doesn't fall under the rules of access to information, and they don't see anything wrong with it. And they are too stupid to take that information and provide derivative advanced analytical summaries of that data and sell that to the public. Ideally what they should be doing is doing that. And making the data free and open to the public.\n\nAnd I see this as well among small NGOs.\n\nAbout the workflow at Jumpstart, we're highly flexible internally but we've got workflows depending on what and with whom were working.\n\nObviously when we do our own work, when we have funds we do our own work, and we do have those funds quite often. Every Monday morning we have an editorial review board, and that is where we decide, we discus what we've been doing, and we talk about whats been happening and what we want to work on, and this happens every Monday morning. This includes, lets say we want to do a story on crime, we immediately look at the data landscape, we look at all the data is out there, we will look who has data and request it right away, and we see if there is not if we can collect the data ourselves. So that is our own work, it can be a story, or a tool. For example with Xtraktr, a tool that we are building which makes data publicly available, accessible, and explorable, and usable. We also talk about how we can advertise and market these things. So that it gets a lot of attention.\n\nBut working with partners we don't have that kind of flexibility. They often don;t know what they really want, so there is a high learning curve. These partners often don't know how to communicate. They say we want to communicate to everybody, but that is impossible, there is not one universal 'people'. So we will focus on what data they have, what is the message they want to communicate and to whom they want to communicate. And then we try to come up with creative ways using different technologies to then do that. And it doesn't have to be just infographics, it can be interactive visualizations, video games, street art, performance art. There are a whole variety of mechanisms to communicate information and data. We try not to limit ourselves.\n\nIt helps that on our team we have three full-time designers, we've got two full-time developers and one half-time developer, we have two full-time researchers, and when we approach an issue we usually do it all together. So we sit down at the table and we brainstorm. If we work with a partner, we bring the partner in. We try to get them to experience what it actually means to creatively approach an issue with the idea of engagement and communication.\n\nSome organizations just refuse to do things, but sometimes we get organizations that do want to learn they get involved and that is quite fun. Our partners work on important social issues, we don't do just commercial work, these opportunities are great we work on issues that are very important, and by and large that is great, that's when we have the most success. Ultimately we would love to do our own stuff and collaborate with people to do that stuff, because we recognize we are not experts in everything.\n\nIdeally in the future if we got enough core funding, we would do our own stories and become a tech media organization, but that is not likely to happen so we look for funds that allows us to do what we want to do and what we do best. Usually this works out. Recently we were able to do an Azerbaijani political prisoners tool (https://prisoners.watch) and partnered with Meydan TV and some other organizations, we did not have funding for it but we did it, but we knew it needed to be done. Sometimes you don't have the funding, but it just needs to be done.\n\nOnly sometimes managing is more difficult - we have to know what our limitations are. And then I need to put my foot down, that's enough, stop, we spent too much time on it and we need to rethink it.\n\nRight now we are looking for alternative funds, such as Indiegogo, to become a bit more independent, but Georgia does not fit well into the international finance toolkit, which makes it a lot harder for Georgian NGOs to actual plug in into these really cool crowdfunding tools in a friendly way. Also Georgia's legislation on NGOs is not really conducive to creating an independent NGO sector, such as tax on employment, profit tax, etc. And we have to work within that legal framework.\n\nWe do our best and ultimately, these last two years we came out with so many interesting tools \u2013 election data portal, we actually built the voting records database for the parliament that is actively being used by a number of organizations: NDI, TI, and ourselves. We've created hundreds of infographics, we've done a video game which won an international award and an infographic as well, and by Transparify we've been acknowledged as being one of the most transparent NGOs in the country. It is not easy, but it is important to set a good example on what we do.\n\n<strong>It is not easy, but doing non-profit work is never easy for anyone especially if you really care and want to do the work you want to do. And I think if you're happy, just doing work that you get funded to do, than that's different. But we are not happy with that model, and we think that organizations exist to fill a gap, if your gap is always dictated and funded by your donors then, I am sorry, but what are you really doing? You have to start asking more existential questions then if that's the case.</strong>\n\nThere are so many things we want to achieve. If people want positive impact, they need to start thinking out of the box and explore real specific targets, subgroups of society, that can actual achieve positive impact. And start to build on that, using technology and creativity in the process.\n\nWe could use more volunteers, in a number of ways, volunteers who want to research, crowdsource data.\n\nFor example. recently we collected data on sounds and volumes around the city and after that we did an infographic on sound pollution and how it effects your hearing. Projects like that, there is no data on it. It would be more successful if we had more data on it.\n\nSometimes we need help on fact checking all the data, for example the Azerbaijani political prisoners project, we had volunteer and meydan.tv to do it, but more would've been better.\n\nJumpstart is very busy, we are a small group of people and we dont have time to have representatives at all the discussions and meetings both with civil society and the government and we need to. If we had volunteers that could help us be present, take notes and share our insights and input into that process we'd be a lot better off. is. Just some help with activities that we are involved in and want to be better in. We tried to find funding but its not sustainable. The only way we can be present if we are funded full time.\n\nBut we share all our assets with our volunteers, it's a give and take.\n\nGeorgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, the South Caucasus, they often work in a bubble, more access to international networks to get involved and become part of larger international movements, the more we can gain from the movements. The OGP for example is one, open data movements, open parliament movements, adoption of international standards, and just tools and concepts that are being discussed internationally that Georgia could benefit from. Often Georgia seems to be behind ten years behind the curve. And there are a lot of really new schools and ideas, related to transparency, accountability, corruption, data journalism, visualization that are being popularized, open sourced, and yet for some reason, I think Georgian government agencies, NGOs, people are not always really aware of these things, because they are not involved internationally in networks and communities. It is crucial that Georgia sees itself as a member of these networks and gets involved and participates in these discussions and the development.\n\nAll this stuff is reciprocated, if Georgia gets involved, the world sees more Georgia. And there is more pressure to move things. I think that can only be good.\n\nJumpStart tries to be really involved internationally. I get involved in international conferences and unconferences, we reach out to organizations beyond our borders, because the work we do, maybe we focus on local issues, but the approaches and mechanisms are not isolated to Georgia. Georgia is not unique in almost any of these things. Poor quality of journalism, government not sharing information: whoohoo it's not unique. Lets get involved with other organizations and see if we can plow through these problems together and we are not alone, we're benefiting from a collective set of resources.\n\nThere are a lot organizations doing similar things to what we're doing, it's really popular right now. Locally I know that Elva has been doing most of what we've done, good for them. Locally the market is not that big to compete, but they've found markets elsewhere and are based in Tbilisi. There are a lot of media organizations elsewhere that are doing amazing data-journalism work in South America: nation, media organizations in Mexico. A lot of these organizations get a lot more negative repercussions for their work than we do in Georgia; fortunately in Georgia we don't have the government attacking us or the mafia shooting us down in the streets.\n\nI can name a few, but there really are so many: Open Knowledge Foundation, Sunlight Foundation, they're all doing on different scales and different scopes similar work and there is a lot of value in that. All these organizations are really open to collaboration and I think that it's important.\n\nGeorgia locally, I think Transparency International Georgia is doing a lot of work but I don't think they realize the potential. They do really amazing research but then the messaging could be a lot better We've been trying working with them in the past but then also they aren't really well managed and things fall through the cracks. Fortunately they are aware of that.\n\nBut I don't see a lot of organizations locally doing what we do.\n\nCreative approaches there are many. If we look at the Guerrilla Gardeners movement, a group of people that believe in something and use creative approaches to solve environmental and urban problems, and I think that\u2019s amazing. I think Iare Pekhit is doing similar positive approaches, creative approaches in communication and engagement. I think they are great ideas, that work locally, they are very local, but I think it's not working in isolation so that's good.\n\nI see some organizations picking up their boot straps and really trying to improve things. I mean, CRRC is being forced through funding to search for more sustainable funding and engaging approaches, ISET similarly.\n\nI think the kind of work that we do is transferable to almost any sector. The educational sector needs it the most here in Georgia. But the methodologies that we use can be used: what are you trying to achieve, how do you get there, what tools do you use. Those can be used in the educational sector as well. Using technology, creativity, design, data, to tackle social issues.\n\nWe try really hard to partner with organizations and help out as we can.\n\nJumpStart's long-term perspective is to continue innovating and trying new things. Ultimately the concepts are simple, we have goals we want to achieve, we have stories we want to tell, and we want to try new and interesting ways to do those things.\n\nWe are going to continue working, and we would love more support from all sides to improve transparency of agencies and organizations and that includes the data that they have. We will build tools and support organizations that are willing to share their data and make it public, so that people can use the data how they want and not how they want other people to use it. This would help us out a lot and other people as well.\n\nIf people care about the issues of transparency and decision making in a democracy, then they can either support it or be a force against it and we will keep building tools such as Xtraktr to help encourage transparency of data and public access.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-23 11:26:56", "updated_at": "2018-06-05 16:02:37.063422", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 3922, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 30.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2551], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3120, "user_id": 2159, "topic_id": 3087, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<span>N<span>ew Innovation to prove the roles of Computer Program in our live and how it will control a lot of engineering fields to improvement the Infrastructure Maintenance and Operation (Storm water O&amp;M) and increase protectively, accurate result and quality of life, being environmentally friendly (Green Management).</span></span>\n\n<span>AUTOMATICALLY SMART GATES FOR STORM WATER INLETS WITH ELECTRONIC MAINTENANCE (E- RAIN GATE)</span>\n\n<span>(Registered Patent No.: 2011/ 514 (Egyptian Patent Office)). &amp;

Europe is the place-to-go for several millions of women and men. This will not change in the next decades. The challenge is to think about this not as a threat, but as an opportunity. That is, to imagine how migration can become a driver of innovation towards a younger, more dynamic, more cosmopolitan and, at the end of the day, more resilient Europe.   \n\nNo one knows whether, and how, this positive perspective could become real. The only wise move to do is to consider this broad view, i.e. the possibility of a new cosmopolitan Europe, as a design-orienting scenario: a shared vision on the basis of which to experiment local solutions, to discuss them and to use them to feed a broad social learning process. And this is what we attempt here.\n\n\"Collaborative inclusion\" is a reflexive design exercise to explore how collaboration between migrants and residents can strengthen the social fabric. More precisely, we look at <em>what kinds</em> of collaborative services (intended as result-oriented collaborations among different actors) can produce social, cultural, economic value.\n\nAnswering this question will lead us to another one: <em>how</em> to conceive and/or evaluate collaborative service capable to produce such multiple value? This reflexive design exercise adopts three simple evaluation criteria. A service is considered \"better\" when:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Each migrant has more scope to express his/her ideas, and to choose what to do and how.</li>\n\n<li>He/she is active and uses better his/her sensitivity, skills and knowledge in the service. </li>\n\n<li> He/she produces more, better results for him/herself, for other migrants and for the whole resident community.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nThese three criteria, which come from design for social innovation experiences in different fields of application, are quite simple. We suspect that most services deployed in Europe to dealing with migration fail all three, quite spectacularly. \n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">\n\n<a id=\"who\" name=\"who\"></a>Who should participate </h3>\n\nWe only ask that participants do their best be critical, creative and committed.<span> </span>No specific information or competence on migration issue is required. We believe we all have firsthand experience at coming to terms with migration. Many of us are migrants (especially in Brussels!); the others are part of host communities. We are all citizen experts. Additionally, some of us have extra skills (design) or experiences (hosting newcomers in their homes). We specifically welcome:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>refugees or ex-refugees.</li>\n\n<li>people who can translate to and from Arabic.</li>\n\n<li>people who are involved in projects aimed at facilitating the welcome and insertion of migrants and refugees (example: there are many projects in the<a href=\"https://hackpad.com/Tech-Projects-For-Refugees-hL0DFzrTNAq\"> Techfugees project directory</a>).</li>\n\n<li>designers.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nWe already have some participants in all these categories, but the more the better!\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">\n\n<a id=\"where\" name=\"where\"></a>When, where and how to participate</h3>\n\nCollaborative inclusion is part of the <a href=\"/t/welcome-to-lote5/4849\">Living On The Edge 5</a> community gathering.

How can migrants and other resident actors collaborate to improve their quality of the life?\n\n<strong>Hypothesis</strong>: In the complexity of the present society we can already find promising examples of migrants-residents collaboration: collaborative initiatives demonstrating how the search of migrants\u2019 inclusion can be turned in a collaborative service, and therefore, in the exploration of new ways of living and working. \n\n<strong>Methodology</strong>: The exercise is in two steps: (1) to consider and discuss a number of promising examples, and (2) to improve them and/or use them as triggers for brand new proposals. \n\n<strong>Specificity</strong>: We build on our previous experience in design for social innovation, and aim to verify its usefulness in creating value for both the migrants and the whole society. This leads us to work in three main directions, that translate into three main criteria for the conception and evaluation of the services the group will come up with: \n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>User-centered approach (as precondition)</strong>: solutions must consider each migrant as a free individual. That is, it must be based on his/her right and concrete possibility to express ideas, and choose what to do and how.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Capability approach (as main design guideline)</strong>: solutions must be based on migrants\u2019 active participation. More precisely, they should enable them to use at best their sensitivity, skills and knowledge.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Multiple-value production (as result to be achieved)</strong>: solutions must achieve some practical and social results for all the involved actors (migrants and residents) and for society as a whole (in terms of physical and social commons improvement). </li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">\n\n<a id=\"aims\" name=\"aims\"></a>Aims</h3>\n\nThe aim of the workshop is not to invent new solutions (it will be impossible to do it in a serious way in this context) but to start form some existing promising practices, to imagine and present ideas and actions to amplify their potentialities.\n\nWhere:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Promising practices are initiatives that are already operating in the collaborative inclusion spirit. That is, living examples of how collaboration between migrants and local communities can solve problems and generate values for all (the same migrants and the whole society).</li>\n\n<li>To amplify potentialities means to give promising practices visibility and support. That is, (1) to increase their possibility to be positively recognized by larger number of people (among both migrants and residents), and (2) to improve the (social, cultural, normative, technical, and economic) environment so that it could become easier for the given promising practices to consolidate and last in time, and for other similar initiatives to start and flourish.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nIdeas and actions means everything can be conceived in terms of communication, services, places, events and performances that could give that specific practice, and its produced values more visibility and/or that could produce for that same practice, or for other similar ones, a more supportive environment \n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">\n\n<a id=\"structure\" name=\"structure\"></a>Workshop structure</h3>\n\nThe workshop is organised in three moments:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>10.00 Setting the scene and promising practices presentations</li>\n\n<li>11.00 Group work (in 5 parallel groups) (including lunch)</li>\n\n<li>15.00 Group presentations and discussion</li>\n\n<li>16.00 End</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">\n\n<a id=\"brief\" name=\"brief\"></a>Working groups brief</h3>\n\nA facilitator will help each working group for extra speed, fluidity and fun. Each group will work on one promising case study of a service for refugees and migrants. Given this, each group outline one or more ideas/actions to amplify its potentialities. The focus can be on:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Visibility, to make the values a given promising practice (directly and indirectly) produces more visible and attractive.</li>\n\n<li>Support, to make its environment more favourable, for the same promising practice and for other similar ones.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Expected results</strong> for workgroups are:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Each group conceive 2-3 ideas/actions and the communicative artefacts needed to present them. These ideas/actions must be motivated and presented indicating the main involved actors, outlining their organization and their technical and economic viability.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Activities</strong> of working groups activity will be divided into three phases:\n\n<strong>Phase 1: Understanding and representing</strong> (the case, its actors and its values)\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Outlining the promising practice organization form, focusing on the values it produces (for the migrant and for the local community)</li>\n\n<li>Identifying the involved actors, focusing on migrants (and creating personas).</li>\n\n<li>Defining the related journey of experience, focusing on its main touch points</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Phase 2: Generating ideas</strong> (on how to give visibility and support to the case)\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>In-depth discussion of the produced values, focusing on their strengths and weakness.</li>\n\n<li>Generation of ideas (for example, each group member indicates an idea. These individual ideas are clustered in groups with similar meanings and discussed by the working group to find the first 2-3 better ones.</li>\n\n<li>Ideas consolidation, with the definition of: main involved actors, outlining their organization and their technical and economic viability.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Phase 3: Making visible</strong> (producing communicative artefacts to present the group results)\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Group members prepare the 2-3 ideas/actions presentation, considering the need of a very short, 5\u2019 presentation.   </li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">\n\n<a id=\"PreWorkshop\" name=\"PreWorkshop\"></a>Before the workshop</h3>\n\nEach participant is invited:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>to search for promising case and select, at least, one example that, in his/her view, is (totally or at least partly) coherent with the three previously indicated criteria of conception and evaluation.</li>\n\n<li>to write a short presentation of the selected example (name, place, main promoters, goals and values produced for the migrants and for the society), add a photo and edit the whole in an A4 format (only one sheet).

My personal reasons are actually solidarity and civicness. I understand that people can choose not to participate (if they can contribute in many other ways, for instance -or al least- defending their\u00a0 own <strong><em>Civil</em>\u00a0and political\u00a0<em>rights</em></strong>) but in my case, my personal and professional qualifications somehow compel me to contribute to the cause. I am also in the movement for what I get from it: I am learning A GREAT DEAL, I am growing as a person and making hundreds of friends!\n\n<strong><em>And also I notice you keep rephrasing answers in terms of \"we\" instead of I..- \u00a0We want, we believe, we shall.. is there something that you find in the workings of your organization that makes it so interesting to be part of it?</em></strong>\n\n\u201cWe\u201d is something philosophically very important for human beings, to feel and have the notion of being a part of something, In this case, as part of a global upraising, I feel connected and synchronized with people that are far away, they are culturally different, we will probably never meet, but we have many things in common. \u201cWE\u201d\u00a0 is very significant right now (it means humankind), it is used for achievements (team work, collective thinking) The \u201cI\u201d is used for \u201cI compromise myself to carry over this task with love and generosity\u201d, \u201cI will happily participate of this common project\u201d, \u201cI am thinking about the ones who are not here but they also can get a benefit\u201d\n\n<strong>\u00a0<em>are you just a member of Indignados or are you founder/ someone from the higher end? (coordinator)..?\u00a0</em></strong>\n\nI am a founder because I\u00a0 was the first one in twon to join a bunch of\u00a0 5 students and 5 unemployed one morning (May 17<sup>th</sup>) in order to support their occupation.\n\nThere is no hierarchy within the \u201corganization\u201d, no higher end, every one is a leader (leader at home, leader of our own lifes and choices).\n\n\u00a0At the beginning I thought this was going to represent a conflict for OWS (maybe these lack of -ill and misled- leadership would be too \"communist\" for the American mindset) but surprisingly they decided to adopt the idea as well.\n\n\u00a0I am a coordinator, yes, I coordinate my own tasks and I work with coordinators all over the globe who coordinate their own area of responsibility with me.\n\nI have a degree in IMS (Integrated Management Systems: HSEQ), I am also a junior project manager, from my professional point of view, the performance is so outstanding that, I we were a transnational we would have crushed some of the largest economies of the world already!

Makerfox is not a workshop format, but the kind of barter deals that happen there can be nicely packaged into something that can be used in a workshop. Is that what you are looking for here? If so, here are two ideas (I can elaborate on the one you want me to):\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>Currency experiment.</strong> I think it was <a href=\"/u/matslats\">@matslats</a> and a colleague who developed this nice group game (works with nuts / sweets and money tokens) that lets people understand different money mechanisms and their consequences intuitively. With Vinay, we developed and extension that allows to understand network bartering intuitively. Has to be tried before use in a workshop.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Barter matrix.</strong> A spreadsheet based matrix that allows to construct a network barter deal with the audience during a presentation. Thus, a way to let the audience experience that they can help each other much more than they imagined. Developed for last Berlinale, but was not used in the end. If there is enough time, the information in there can then be put into makerfox.com and the Makerfox will calculate a deal.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nIn case you want technical integration between edgeryders.eu and makerfox.com: I'd like to promise that Makerfox will work as expected, but who knows at this point. So, if you want that, be aware of the risk ;-) Such integration can be looser or tighter, and it's best I think to start with something light and easy and then to progress as needed. So, start with the first step of this list:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>\"Public goods\" widgets.</strong> This is the new, better way of moneyless crowdfunding in Makerfox. People say: I offer to do this or that activity with collective benefits if I get this amount of products and services in exchange via network barter. And then multiple other people indicate they want to donate to that effort. It's kind of like group buying. Integration would happen with a small widget that people can embed into an iframe in a post on edgeryders.eu where they present their \"public good\" crowdfunding campaign. Could be supported by a special Drupal content type as well (can be added later). Work is mostly on the Makerfox side. Takes 8-10 hours, or 16-20 hours if with the content type.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Moneyless crowdfunding campaign widgets.</strong> This relates to moneyless donations, given without requiring a compensation and thus unlike the \"public goods\" above. Would just be a little makerfox.com-generated HTML widget that can be embedded as an iframe on edgeryders.eu and other sites to give a link to a moneyless crowdfunding campaign and to show how much donations were received already.

To leverage the fact that projects stand to win from it. I would focus on existing projects as first target group, as they have a good network usually, probably need money and will also put it to best use. In my opinion efforts are sometimes too much focussed on launching new things, instead of helping existing ones sustain themselves.\n\nWhat you are then doing is interfacing for projects to monetize excess capacity in their network. Instead of having to invest heavily into logistics, marketing, sales, everything that comes with selling something, you can rely on a 'service' like yours.\u00a0I think this ties in nicely with\u00a0the discussion <a href=\"/t/community-call-1-creating-a-simple-offer-and-process-for-participants/6135\">here</a> on business models for The Reef. Diversity is hard to do early on, but interfaces make it a little easier.\n\nOffering this service to a social project rather than a person (what Airbnb does) offers some more interesting possibilities, especially in the way you set this up. What if people can\u00a0choose to 'bind' their room to a specific cause, donating most of the returns\u00a0to that project? You could have, eg. for ReaGent where I am involved, a ReaGent branded accomodation service, hosted inside Fairbnb? Will projects then shift more and more towards mobilizing their community to help in non-material ways with excess capacity? Does this allow/force/nudge projects and their stakeholders to be stripped down to the very essence: a community with a certain mission, with a lesser focus on the means to an end?\n\nJust some quick thoughts and a lot of questions, it's a super interesting topic. Would love to hear more, but mainly see things prototyped.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-12 11:08:29", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:08.437498", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 326, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [20627], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30739, "user_id": 2422, "topic_id": 3954, "post_number": 17, "raw": "<b>hehe</b>\n\nditto :)\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-20 08:36:12", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:49.203610", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 6, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24761, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3837, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Great!</b>\n\nThanks, <a href=\"/u/teirdes\">@teirdes</a>.

So, </span><b style=\"font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); \">power</b><span> is the ability of human beings for performing actions or institutional functions from their own will and for their own goals with the aim of organizing and promoting the production, reproduction and enhancing of their lives (and those who are coming after in order to be sustainable).</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<u><font color=\"#333333\"><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><font size=\"3\"><i>Political power</i></font></font></font></u>\n\n<font color=\"#333333\"><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><font size=\"3\">Humans are gregarious beings, so they live in groups or communities. Living in a group, the individual wills of its members could disperse with each one pursuing their private, multiple and conflicting interests, and thus the power or force of one's will is canceling out the other, and it would result in <i>impotence</i>. Conversely, if the individual wills could combine their goals, their purpose and their strategic goals, then its possible reach (adding their forces as a \"common will-for-life\") more power.</font></font></font>\n\n<span>To avoid impotence and reach the convergence of their individual wills into a common goal is necessary to reach a </span><b style=\"font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); \">rational agreement</b><span> through dialogue and conversation. This convergence of wills by a rational agreement is called </span><b style=\"font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); \">political power</b><span>. To be valid, this convergence must be by agreement of all participants as a free, autonomous and rational agents with equal capacity to intervene in the dialogue. This convergence can not be the result of an act of domination or violence, where the individual wills are forced to deny their own \"will-for-life\" for the benefit of the \"will-for-life\" of a particular individual or subgroup; because in this case, the political power is weakened to the point that had only one active and creative will, not the wills 's convergence from the whole group.</span>\n\n<span>But the convergence of wills through a rational agreement is not enough to have political power (or fully describe it). </span><b style=\"font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); \">Strategic feasibility</b><span> is also required, i.e. the group must have the instrumental and strategic mediums available to pursue this common will empirically. As an example, if the group has a hunger crisis, the group must have the mediums (resources, knowledge, etc.) through which to channel their common will to develop the agricultural systems capable of providing the needed food.</span>\n\n<span>It is called </span><b style=\"font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); \">potentia</b><span> - in its double sense of force and being a future possibility - the group inherent capacity to develop political power. This capacity arises from the group as a network where each node is the power of a member of the group fed by her/his will-for-life.</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<u><font color=\"#333333\"><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><font size=\"3\"><i>Institutional power</i></font></font></font></u>\n\n<span>Originally the group is undifferentiated, i.e. its members are undifferentiated among themselves without functional differentiation. A this moment the group has potentia, i.e. it has the capacity to develop political power; but this power does not yet have real existence, it is like the seed, that possessing the potential future tree, is not yet the tree. In order to become real this power \u2013 the seed becomes the tree \u2013 it should be organized, to take some shape i.e. the political power should be institutionalized. This necessary institutionalization of political power in the group is what is called the </span><b style=\"font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); \">potestas</b><span>. It is at this point of building the necessary institutions for the exercise of political power that the group ceases to be undifferentiated and becomes institutionalized. A group is institutionalized when its members decide to give themselves a heterogeneous organization of its functions to achieve different purposes. It is this functional differentiation among its members which allows them to coordinate complex actions to achieve common goals. At the same time, that functional differentiation is to accept certain restrictions on individual freedom, cause now the group members must move in the framework of the common will voluntarily agreed.</span>\n\n<span>Then potestas is the heterogeneous differentiation of functions through institutions that allow political power becomes real, empirical, practical. The moment when a group institutionalizes \u2013 makes real \u2013 its political power marks the emergence of the </span><b style=\"font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); \">politics</b><span>. Then politics will be the long adventure of the proper use (or corrupted) of the potestas. Is in this split between potentia and potestas where all political service will be possible, but at the same time will be possible all corruption and oppression source of all injustice and domination.</span>\n\n<span>Power is an ability, you either have or not have, but it is never taken. What it is possible to be taken and dominated are the institutions that involve the mediation of its practice. Power as such it is only belonging to the group and always as a potential. This power becomes real through the institutionalization (potestas), which is mediating the strategic action to achieve common goals. When we are speaking about </span><b style=\"font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); \">governance</b><span> (the practice of the power), it means performing the functions specified by the institutions that make real the political power. Governance is the </span><b style=\"font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); \">delegated</b><span> practice of the political power. The singular practice (private) of an action is when it is on behalf of whom is practicing it. The delegated practice (public) is the action taken on behalf of the group through a differentiated function undertaken with individual attention. The basis of this delegated practice is the power from the group (as a potentia). Those who are practicing the power do it for the group as a mediation for the group.</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<u><font color=\"#333333\"><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><font size=\"3\"><i>Obediential power</i></font></font></font></u>\n\n<span>The group's power (potentia) is organized in institutions (potestas) where the power is exercised as delegated practice by elected representatives to meet the demands of the full life of the group members (material sphere), fulfilling the requirements of a legitimacy system (formal sphere), to the extent of the strategically feasible. To the representatives is given a certain authority (because the seat of the </span><i style=\"font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); \">auctoritas</i><span> is not the government, but always ultimately the group) to meet more successfully on behalf of the group the functions of his office. Thus, the representatives did not act from themselves as a source of ultimate sovereignty and authority but as delegates. The objectives of the representative must be always act for the group, listening to their demands and complaints. The word 'obedience' comes from the Latin words, '</span><i style=\"font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); \">Ob</i><span>' that means having something or someone in front, and '</span><i style=\"font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); \">Audire</i><span>', that means to hear; then 'obedience' means '</span><i style=\"font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); \">To know how to listen to the other</i><span>'. Then obedience is the basic attitude that must have a representative who fulfills a role in a political institution.</span>\n\n<span>Thus, the </span><b style=\"font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); \">obediential power</b><span> \u2013 practice the power listening to whom are being represented- is the truly power practice in a context of justice. And here is completed a brief description of the power in its proper sense, positively, as the force and the agreed wills from the group 's members that is organizing institutions and taking actions through these institutions in order to achieve common goals for the group.</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<u><font color=\"#333333\"><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><font size=\"3\"><i>Power corruption</i></font></font></font></u>\n\n<span>The practice of delegated power can be split positively in the obediential power, and negatively in the </span><b style=\"font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); \">fetishized power</b><span>. Fetishism is the unfortunate reversal where the founded appears as a foundation, and the foundation (the real base) as the founded. The fetishism of power is when the representative believes that he can say that him or the institution where is fulfilling some function, is the foundation, the political power itself. At this moment the representatives are denying the will-for-life of the group members in benefit of their own will-for-life, that is becoming will-for-power.</span>\n\n<span>Once the power is fetishized, inevitably the representative action is a dominant action, not an exercise of the delegated power from the group. So the fetishization of power is a will-for-power as a control (domination) over the group. Then, politics becomes the art of exercising power over opponents who are overpowered to the will of fetishised institutions in favor of some subgroups; and the fetishized power, unable to rest on the strength of the group, should rely on these subgroups that are overpowering the whole group violently.</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<font color=\"#333333\"><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><font size=\"3\">Some consequences from the fetishized power:</font></font></font>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><font color=\"#333333\"><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><font size=\"3\">The potestas destroys potentia, i.e. divides the group, prevent agreement from the group bottom-up, creates conflicts. \"Divide and rule\" says the old fetishist adage</font></font></font></li>\n\n<li><span>The fetishized power expects rewards, the corrupted representatives hope to use the fetishized power by the pleasure of exercising their wills, as ostentatious pride, as despotic arrogance, as sadism to theirs enemies, as missappropiation of property and wealth, and also this willingness of domain surreptitiously slips into the erotic domination of their subalterns</span></li>\n\n<li><span>The bureaucracies from the institutions that are mediating the political power are corrupted, thus appearing the elites as self-referential and not representing anymore the whole group.</span></li>\n\n<li><font color=\"#333333\"><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><font size=\"3\">There may be corruption among subgroups from the whole group, as for example, corporatism is the pursuit of the compliance of private interests through the collaboration with the fetishistic power of those who govern</font></font></font></li>\n\n<li><font color=\"#333333\"><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><font size=\"3\">The whole group may be also corrupted when remain silent about obvious facts of corruption and domination</font></font></font></li>\n\n</ul><font color=\"#333333\"><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><font size=\"3\">\u200b</font></font></font>\n\n<span>So, as we saw, power is not bad and in fact is the only way that we can achieve common goals.

Benedict protocolized. While at Monte Cassino, he writes the Rule as a guide to people wishing to live together in a monastery. The Rule is really a remarkable document, that unMonasterians (especially those leading new settlements) would do well to spend some time brooding over. If you have any experience with online community management, you will find the Rule eerily familiar: it has roles with different levels of access and authorization (abbott, cellarer, brethren); a moderation policy to prevent flame wars from distracting monks for doing God's work (and their own); a very modern idea of the higher echelons as a service to the rank-and-file monks, rather than as their lords. Most importantly, the Rule does not specify a set of goals and activities to reach them: it never says \"build a library and a scriptorium and start copying manuscripts to preserve knowledge as the Roman Empire goes down in flames\", or \"build extra space to lodge travelers, since the Early Middle Ages are low on inns\". Yet, benedictine monasteries did end up doing those things and others: following the Rule can result in many outcomes, all beneficials from the point of view of Benedict and his crew. Most of them could not possibly have been foreseen by Benedict himself. Since it is a document of instructions, the Rule is software; since it does not carry out a specific task but enables a variety of mutually consistent outcomes, it is not an app. The Rule is a protocol. And what a protocol! It spread all over the world; arguably transformed (mostly for the better) Middle Ages Europe; is still in use after a millennium and a half; and has spread beyond the Catholic church (it is used in some Orthodox and even Lutheran contexts). I can't think of many other protocols with that kind of track record. Benedict may have been the Supreme Ninja Mage Lord Protocol Hacker of all time.\u201d\n\n- See more at: <a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/unhagiography-what-modern-day-social-innovators-can-learn-from-the-life-and-times-of-st#sthash.2gPJMx83.dpuf\">/t/unmonastery/315/unhagiography-what-modern-day-social-innovators-can-learn-from-the-life-and-times-of-st#sthash.2gPJMx83.dpuf</a>\n\n<strong>Key Questions:</strong>\n\n-How will the internal politics of the unMonastery function?\n\n-How is order and productivity maintained?

I have general comments, and would like everyone's opinion. I list below four issues, from least to most severe.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Some stuff is missing completely</strong> from the formatted document, though it was provided in the GDocs.\u00a0For example: the description of unforeseen Risk R7 and the scientific papers (they are <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uX1dCVe-4g6dV6XBpzGQXqRuC84qjfmEpYDmd08-cOo/edit\">here</a>); the communication and dissemination activities (in <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BxnwAmGNB9t9Q3pob1hCb1ZZbUk\">this folder</a>). I guess this is no big deal, just some editing.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Some stuff is a bit inconsistent</strong>. For example, in the \"Progress beyond the state of the art\" there are subsections on the state of the art in\u00a0Network science for online deliberation and community management,\u00a0Design for participation and collective intelligence etc. Here, different people followed different strategies. \u00a0I referred to the proposal (\"no breakthrough advances since we started the project\"); others copy-pasted the proposal.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li><strong>The reporting structure is unclear,</strong> at least to me.\u00a0Section 1.2 is supposed to give the reader an overall view of the project as it advances towards completion. I see substantial overlap with section 1.1 (Objectives) of Tech Report Part B. There, we had to \"list the specific objectives for the project as described in section 1.1 of the DoA and described the work carried out during the reporting period towards the achievement of each listed objective. Provide clear and measurable details\".\u00a0How is this different? I admit I am confused.\u00a0At the moment, there is nothing there. Upon re-reading, I thought a possibility would be to put here most of the stuff I wrote under Sections 1.3.2 and 1.3.4. Those are structured as a list \"What we set up to do\" and \"What we have done\"; goals on the first column, and items in the second columns start with \"Done\", \"Partially done\" or \"Not done yet\", and proceed to explain. This would mean writing from scratch sections 1.3.2 and 1.3.4 concentrating on the \"noblest\" parts in opencare: what, in opencare, is\u00a0not just delivering a project, but making an impact on\u00a0science and society. It seems consistent with the help text for section 1.3: \"Progress beyond the state of the art and expected potential impact (including the socio-economic impact and the wider societal implications of the project so far).\"</li>\n\n<li>\"Big picture\" considerations are subjective by definition (the big picture is in the eye of the beholder). By implication, <strong>I do not believe we can write them collectively</strong>. This sort of writing requires an author. What we can do is this: each of us can take responsibility for writing a well-defined piece in a structure. The only structure which is compatible with a decentralized project is that suggested by Guy in <a href=\"/t/mid-term-report-final-stretch/6096/28\">this comment</a>. Basically, take what you find most precious in opencare and argue for it.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nSo, what should I do? Copy 1.3.2 and 1.3.4 into 1.2 and write new impact stuff into 1.3.2 and 1.3.4?\n\n", "created_at": "2017-02-15 23:16:52", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 07:54:01.628382", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 569, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23752, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 3729, "post_number": 7, "raw": "For now we surely have the lunches fixed, we made a food stroll today with @Katalin.

It will be held in multiple locations around the world between June 11th-15th 2015.\n\nThe core team is based in Berlin, Paris and London, we're working out plans for Barcelona, Christchurch, Santiago and more. We've already got @Lauren on board organising something in Athens, and I'd love for more members of the Edgeryders community to join us wherever you are in the world.\n\nWe like the idea of a circular economy \u2013 one which works without waste, where all products should be designed for multiple cycles of use, so that the output of each production process feeds the input of another.\n\nHowever, we don't think this is in any way feasible <em>unless we adopt an open source approach</em>.\n\nWe need transparency and open data, modular open hardware, open standards, free software tools, and interdisciplinary, international collaboration. For a more thorough explanation of what we mean by an Open Source Circular Economy, and why we think it's necessary, please read our <a href=\"http://osced2015.org/open-source-circular-economy-mission-statement/\">Mission Statement</a>.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOSCEdays is a very decentralized event, linked only by a name (OSCEdays) a date (11-15 June 2015), a hashtag (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/OSCEDays\">#OSCEdays</a>) and a few key materials on a website (<a href=\"http://osced2015.org\">osced2015.org</a>).\n\nOtherwise it's all in the hands of local organisers \u2013 what kind of events or projects to take on, what local challenges to address, what kind of people to invite, how to get relevant resources.\n\nFor now, teams can use whatever tools they feel comfortable with to work together \u2013 Facebook, Trello, Edgeryders, Google Drive, our website... but we do plan to hold daily video hangouts during the event, have a central repository for important information, provide clear guidelines for documentation of projects and to centralize and/or link documentation during and after the event. \u00a0\n\nWe feel this is an increasingly important issue and we know that many others are working in a similar vein to us, but rather than chip away at the same issues in isolation, we want to ensure that any efforts put into this idea get the maximum possible traction \u2013 this can only happen by working together, simultaneously.\n\nThis has an internal effect \u2013 the participants feel motivated, they feel part of something, they directly benefit from the face-to-face and online networking, and individual open source circular economy projects from around the world get visibility amongst relevant groups around the world.\n\nThis also has an external effect \u2013 the combined activity of multiple events in multiple fields in multiple locations is big enough and exciting enough to get media attention and bring the idea of an open source approach to the circular economy to a much wider audience, and provide evidence to businesses and policymakers showing there is great potential and support for the idea.\n\nWe know that we're not going to build a circular economy in 5 days. OSCEdays 2015 is just the first step of what we want to develop into an ongoing, long-term project/platform/social enterprise focused on building an Open Source Circular economy.\n\nReasons I think this is relevant to Edgeryders as a community and as individuals:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Our working methods are very much aligned \u2013 distributed collaboration, open processes, no bullshit please, who does the work calls the shots.</li>\n\n<li>Focused on tackling local issues with the aid of global connections and shared ideas, along the lines of unMonastery, Spot The Future and various other Edgeryders projects.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nWhat we need:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Partnerships with projects and organisations. We're working with <a href=\"http://www.futureofwaste.org/\">Future of Waste</a>, <a href=\"http://poc21.cc\">POC21</a>, <a href=\"http://oshwa.org\">Open Source Hardware Association</a> and others, finding ways for our collaboration to be mutually beneficial. If you are part of (or you know of) any organisations doing similar work to us, or ideas of how we could best work together, let us know.</li>\n\n<li>Participants &amp; Organizers interested in taking part, planning or running events, anywhere in the world*, whether a single 2-hour get-together or a 5-day harmonious hackathon. (<a href=\"http://osced2015.org/participate/\">Call for Cities</a>)</li>\n\n<li>Ideas for and contacts with potential sponsors, whether local or multinational.</li>\n\n<li>Ideas for challenges and projects to work on.</li>\n\n<li>Core team members \u2013 there are many more types of skills and experience which would be extremely valuable to this project \u2013 our core team is currently made up of open source specialists, waste researchers, circular economy and sustainability experts, and our skill sets include many aspects of event planning and management, but there are plenty of areas we could use help (eg. web development, social media, accounting, community management, sponsorship... etc, etc, etc)</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nOSCEdays 2015 starts in 4 months.

We already uploaded our feedback including research questions, for the post 2015 consultation report, last Sunday on to the Google Drive!

The UNDP CO office for Egypt let us know on Friday who you'd would like to work with and I've contact them but haven't heard anything from him/her.

There are substantial benefits to group therapy, in addition to human and contact and the openness of being completely vulnerable. Too often, there is a stigma attached and people don\u2019t want to share their experience and rather keep in within. \u00a0Group therapy helps realize you\u2019re not alone. Many patients enter therapy with the disquieting thought that they are unique in their situation, that they alone have certain frightening or unacceptable problems and thoughts.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that each of us is unique and may have unique circumstances, none of us is alone in our struggles. \u00a0It great reduces isolation and alienation. It increases the sense that \u201cwe\u2019re all in this together,\u201d and kind of normalizes the individual situations. While members, in turn, encourage each other for support, feedback, and connection, instead of getting all that from the clinician.\u00a0 By sharing experiences we all learn from each other and navigate out of their current situation and ultimately helps to find your voice in the sense of relating to others.\u00a0 On the flipside, it takes strength and some recognition of the needs of others to function well in a group, not be destroyed by it. Creating the community atmosphere to overcome challenges and gain confidence.\n\nOn another note, at university, they had \u201cprograms\u201d in place and designed to enhance the student\u2019s life, as @Sharon\u00a0mentioned young adults can be very hard on themselves.\u00a0 Aided in concerns or problems such as a feeling of low self-esteem, anxiety, depression and academic concerns.\n\nIt was made almost mandatory by the dean and resident advisers to participate in these groups. There was resistance at first by many and that kind of tapered off. Being a psychology major we helped develop these groups in collaboration with various student groups. It was quite astonishing to see the resistance then you see the connection that was made over time and the participants, well some of them anyway changed their direction and went into this field so maybe it was a chance to tap into their real path they were destined to follow. Through difficulties, we usually discover what we were meant to do. Each one teach one to reach one! Networks can indeed support and enhance the quality of life and provide a buffer against adverse life events and difficulties.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-03-28 05:11:13", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:24.046252", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 438, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 15.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29990, "user_id": 2685, "topic_id": 4517, "post_number": 12, "raw": "<b>Will be there</b>\n\nHi there,\n\nAs I have already said, it would be great to meet all of you at the workshop and I'm also looking forward to exchanging\u00a0ideas and knowledge with you guys.\n\nAlex\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-30 20:21:28", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:45.129839", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 46, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 1.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30561, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 4370, "post_number": 27, "raw": "Thanks!

Identifier un terrain minimal commun \u00e0 tous et qui ne privil\u00e9gie pas d\u00e8s le d\u00e9part le point de vue d'un groupe particulier n'est pas facile.\n\n<strong>Trois facteurs communs</strong>\n\nCe texte tente de contribuer \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 d'un dialogue en partant de trois facteurs communs. Comme il sera plus clair en fin de parcours, cela ne veut pas dire se restreindre \u00e0 ces trois facteurs communs.\n\nLa justification de la s\u00e9lection de ces trois facteurs, plut\u00f4t que d'autres, sera principalement \u00e0 post\u00e9riori : si elle contribue effectivement \u00e0 amorcer le d\u00e9bat.\n\nMais \u00e0 priori, la justification est que, si ces facteurs sont loin d'\u00eatres incontest\u00e9s, contester radicalement leur existence est difficile si on pr\u00e9tend d\u00e9fendre un point de vue un tant soit peu coh\u00e9rent.\n\nLes \u00eatres humains :\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>sont des \u00eatres vivants, biologiques;</li>\n\n<li>ils utilisent, et sont fa\u00e7onn\u00e9s par, le langage;</li>\n\n<li>ils participent, volontairement ou involontairement, \u00e0 la mondialisation sous sa forme actuelle.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nLes deux premiers sont fondamentaux et ne devraient pas, \u00e0 priori, \u00eatre trop controvers\u00e9s.\n\nLe troisi\u00e8me facteur est plus circonstanciel et pourrait, de ce fait, apparaitre comme plus arbitraire ou partial. Je pr\u00e9sente donc, dans cette introduction, quelques arguments pr\u00e9liminaires pour \u00e9viter autant que possible que cette apparence soit un obstacle \u00e0 poursuivre la lecture.\n\n<strong>Mondialisation : contrainte et opportunit\u00e9</strong>\n\nJe d\u00e9finirai pour l'instant ce troisi\u00e8me facteur de mani\u00e8re assez floue, comme l'ensemble des pratiques sociales, scientifiques, techniques, \u00e9conomiques et politiques qui ont concouru et concourent actuellement au d\u00e9veloppement de la mondialisation sous sa forme actuelle.\n\nCes pratiques sont souvent contradictoires mais comportent des synergies fortes. Globalement leur interactions et leur actions font qu'actuellement tous les \u00eatres humains y participent et/ou sont soumis \u00e0 son impact.\n\nC'est donc bien actuellement un facteur commun, m\u00eame si pour des personnes et des groupes diff\u00e9rents les aspects de cette mondialisation auxquels ils sont sensibles peuvent \u00eatre tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rents.\n\nDeux aspects de cette mondialisation sont d\u00e9terminants pour mon propos :\n\n<ol>\n\n<li> pour des raisons que j'explorerai plus en d\u00e9tail dans le corps du texte, l'expansion du pouvoir d'action potentiel d\u00e9passe les capacit\u00e9s et les motivations des modes de d\u00e9cision d'action. Les actions effectivement entreprises manquent de conscience et de pr\u00e9vision des cons\u00e9quences. Cela produit des effets destructeurs \u00e0 grande \u00e9chelle dans des domaines de plus en plus vari\u00e9s. Mais il n'y a pas d'accord g\u00e9n\u00e9ral sur quelles destructions sont graves et/ou \u00e0 qui/quoi les attribuer.</li>\n\n<li>techniquement, pour la premi\u00e8re fois, l'ensemble de l'humanit\u00e9 est, ou sera bient\u00f4t, en mesure de communiquer par une forme de langage en temps r\u00e9el, ou presque.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nLa mondialisation produit ainsi \u00e0 la fois la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 et possibilit\u00e9 technique d'un dialogue global. La question est la possibilit\u00e9 psychologique, sociale et politique d'un tel dialogue.\n\nOn peut envisager que pouvoir communiquer \u00e0 plus grande \u00e9chelle devrait pouvoir faciliter un accord sur les causes des effets destructeurs, et une action pour les r\u00e9duire.\n\nMais pour l'instant il semble que souvent l'effet principal de la facilit\u00e9 technique de communiquer \u00e0 distance soit de durcir le morcellement en facilitant et multipliant la formation de groupes ayant des points de vues homog\u00e8nes, et ne communicant que sur un mode n\u00e9gatif avec tout ce qui s'en \u00e9carte.\n\n<strong>Ma d\u00e9marche</strong>\n\nMon hypoth\u00e8se est que ce qui manque pour aider \u00e0 surmonter ce morcellement, ou plut\u00f4t de le transformer progressivement en diversit\u00e9, c'est moins l'information en tant que telle que l'information sous une forme ad\u00e9quate \u00e0 la compr\u00e9hension r\u00e9ciproque.\n\nJe propose d'explorer une piste pour d\u00e9velopper un ensemble de moyens conceptuels coh\u00e9rent, mais non exclusif, facilitant la compr\u00e9hension r\u00e9ciproque entre humains. Ces moyens s'adressent en premier lieu \u00e0 ceux qui ont le d\u00e9sir, au moins th\u00e9orique, de compr\u00e9hension r\u00e9ciproque. Mais je pr\u00e9senterai aussi une perspective qui pourrait montrer, m\u00eame pour ceux qui n'auraient pas ce d\u00e9sir, l'int\u00e9r\u00eat d'un minimum de compr\u00e9hension r\u00e9ciproque. (Je pr\u00e9cise que je n'exclus pas \u00e0 priori l'existence de situations o\u00f9 la non-communication pourrait \u00eatre une attitude ad\u00e9quate).\n\nLa plupart des arguments que je pr\u00e9sente ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9velopp\u00e9s par d'autres, m\u00eame si pas n\u00e9cessairement sous la m\u00eame forme. Au fur et \u00e0 mesure j'ajouterai des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences dans la mesure o\u00f9 je les retrouve ou les d\u00e9couvre.\n\nSi je fais l'effort d'\u00e9crire, c'est que je n'ai pas trouv\u00e9 de texte qui relie le tout \u00e0 ma satisfaction.\n\n<strong>Mode d'\u00e9criture</strong>\n\nQuelques remarques sur le mode d'\u00e9criture.\n\nLa plupart des textes sont \u00e9crits pour public cible de lecteurs assez d\u00e9fini. Explicitement, ou au moins implicitement par l'utilisation de notions sans qu'il soit ressenti comme n\u00e9cessaire de les justifier, car \u00e9videntes pour ce public.\n\nMon public cible est en principe constitu\u00e9 de personnes de toutes cultures et convictions. La limitation, in\u00e9vitable \u00e0 ce stade je crois, est qu'elles soient ouvertes \u00e0 des pens\u00e9es assez abstraites.\n\nMon mode d'\u00e9criture est donc d\u00e9termin\u00e9, \u00e0 part des questions de style personnel, par le souci d'\u00eatre lisible, sans heurter inutilement, quelles que soient les convictions actuelles des lecteurs.\n\nDe ce point de vue le sch\u00e9ma que j'ai adopt\u00e9 n'est pas sym\u00e9trique. Toute la premi\u00e8re partie est exprim\u00e9e du point de vue 'objectif'. Pour des personnes dont c'est le point de vue normal il pourra ainsi y avoir des d\u00e9saccords avec ce que j'\u00e9cris, mais elles ne seront normalement pas 'heurt\u00e9es'. Mais il est fort probable qu'elles le seront par certaines de mes propositions dans la derni\u00e8re partie. Par contre, des personnes dont le point de vue normal est d\u00e9fini plut\u00f4t en opposition au point de vue 'objectif' risquent fort d'\u00eatre heurt\u00e9es par des parties du d\u00e9but, et ne jamais arriver dans la derni\u00e8re partie o\u00f9 je ferais des propositions qui pourraient servir de jonction avec leur point de vue. Je ne vois pas comment actuellement \u00e9viter cette asym\u00e9trie, je crois qu'elle est li\u00e9e \u00e0 la situation actuelle, la globalisation, comme dit plus haut. J'ai essay\u00e9 de l'att\u00e9nuer un peu, d'une part en pr\u00e9venant de l'existence du probl\u00e8me, comme ici, d'autre part par la structure du texte.\n\n<strong>Structure formelle</strong>\n\nLe texte est structur\u00e9 en hypertexte, avec les outils fournis par la plateforme Edgeryders.\n\nA partir de la table des mati\u00e8res globale, ci-dessous, on aboutit a des textes qui contiennent aussi des table des mati\u00e8res locales, qui renvoient \u00e0 des textes plus d\u00e9taill\u00e9, et ainsi de suite.\n\nCela permet :\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\u00e0 la lecture\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>de ne pas entrer dans le d\u00e9tail des parties que vous connaissez et avec lesquelles vous \u00eates globalement d'accord</li>\n\n<li>en cas de nouveaut\u00e9 (pour vous) de creuser</li>\n\n<li>en cas de d\u00e9saccord de creuser jusqu'\u00e0 compr\u00e9hension, ou identification pr\u00e9cise du d\u00e9saccord</li>\n\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n<li>de structurer le dialogue. Vous \u00eates instamment pri\u00e9s d'intervenir, par vos commentaires, au niveau le plus d\u00e9taill\u00e9 possible.</li>\n\n<li>de faire des liens transversaux (ce point sera explicit\u00e9 plus bas)</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nLe tout est dynamique.  Par la formulation progressive de ma pens\u00e9e, par son \u00e9volution interne, et en r\u00e9ponse aux commentaires et aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements, le texte sera modifi\u00e9 et \u00e9tendu. (Dans la logique du dialogue il faudrait une forme d'interaction plus \u00e9galitaire, mais pour cela il faudra sans doute une base logicielle adapt\u00e9e).\n\n<strong>Structure conceptuelle</strong>\n\nLe coeur du texte est une chronologie des \u00e9tapes significatives du d\u00e9veloppement de la vie sur terre, et de l'humanit\u00e9 jusqu'au pr\u00e9sent, avec une attention particuli\u00e8re sur les aspects langage.\n\nCe coeur est pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 par une introduction (cette page-ci), et par une analyse du fonctionnement du langage qui permet de comprendre comment je le con\u00e7ois et utilise, mais aussi explique la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de la chronologie.\n\nTout cela est \u00e9crit, plus ou moins explicitement suivant les parties, du point de vue 'objectif' standard actuel.\n\nJ'explicite, de l'int\u00e9rieur de ce point de vue 'objectif', comment il est advenu et quelles sont ses limitations.\n\nJe propose des pistes pour surmonter ces limitations et ouvrir un dialogue critique entre tous les points de vues.\n\nTout le long du texte j'extrais, ou je propose, des 'principes heuristiques' de l'examen des diff\u00e9rents domaines abord\u00e9s. Ils sont rassembl\u00e9s \u00e0 part et me servent \u00e0 structurer les propositions de la derni\u00e8re partie.\n\nvocabulaire\n\ncontextes topics\n\n(suite \u00e0 venir)", "created_at": "2015-03-20 18:22:21", "updated_at": "2018-04-14 14:26:48.166194", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1663, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 27.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25044, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 6406, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>same hangout link</b>\n\nAdded it in the wiki.\n\nSee you on Tuesday!\n\nLet me know if you need something from me in advance..\n\n", "created_at": "2017-06-24 10:22:04", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:18.558830", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 30, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [24099], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5307, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5274, "post_number": 1, "raw": "We have lost the network.

What follows is an account of what I understood about the initiatives, how they work and the challenges they face [Ulli, Ahmed Rabie and Dina]\u00a0are deeply involved and I hope they can correct me where I make mistakes...\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Mesaha</h3>\n\n... is a mix between a co-working space in downtown Cairo and a community-development collective founded by a group of 28 people after the January 25 revolution. What makes them unique is the a sophisticated business/sustainaibility model and deep involvement with each project that uses the infrastructures. Also, unlike most of the co-working spaces I heard about in Cairo, they are less focused on startups and more on cultural projects <span>(I think)</span>:\n\n<em>\"Mesaha's main goal is to support different initiatives and working groups with providing the physical space, the networking opportunities, and the technical support as well as the learning space. However, startups and companies and individuals working on their personal projects are included in the community as co-workers where we can provide the physical space for them and they contribute with paying some money.\"</em>\n\nDuring our conversation Dina (involved in running the co-working space) tells me there was a feeling that young people were looking for spaces which would nurture their efforts to contribute towards improving their lives beyond personal careers and developing those of their communities. Like many other interesting initiatives in Egypt, Mesaha is a child of the revolution (my interpretation). The popular uprising unleashed a tidal wave of creativity amongst many young people. Even though many of those dreams have been cruelly crushed in the aftermath it is like something came unstuck as a result...a sense of collective agency perhaps?\u00a0A collective of people [all Cairenes?did they know one another? what did they have in common?] decided to get Mesaha going:\u00a0<span>I am unsure as to the step by step of how they took the first steps, and built it to where it is now (any idea <a href=\"/u/hazem\">@Hazem</a> ?)\"</span>\n\n<em>\"we have 28 co-founders, at the very first beginning they were interested to start this project so each of them contributed paying some money to rent the flat and to buy some essentials, they know each other and the thing they have in common is their passion towards helping working groups and initiatives, and their experience in working with youth activists and the problems that they faced finding a \"space\" that acts as a hub for their ideas and activities.\"</em>\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe Mesaha crowd places a lot of emphasis on hosting and personalised matchmaking between complementary projects and people in their community. Which also results in their being up to date with what is happening in all the projects (which is also a necessity to be \"safe\" in the current political climate). They very kindly offered to host an adhoc community get together on the thursday where we convened a small group of people to discuss possibilities of codesigning, prototyping and testing a sustainable model of networked collaboration. Who knows, maybe even getting some kind of network barter going?\u00a0\n\n<em>\"Mesaha's sustainability is mostly depending on the contribution policy that we talked about, different people contribute with different forms to make sure that their space is sustaining, some of them meet at Mesaha but they don't necessarily know each other\"</em>\n\nThe social contract seems to be that people can contribute to maintaining the infrastructures in different ways: it's pretty adhoc. Basically they get to know you and your initiative to understand how they could support you. And in return they ask how you can contribute: for some people it's money, with others it is helping manage the space and taking on community management responsibilities:\n\n<em>\"Trust and transparency are among our values in Mesaha, that's why we care about knowing everything about our initiatives and working groups as well as sharing with them all the information about Mesaha, our commitments, our story, our principals, our rules ...etc.\"</em>\n\nThe main challenge is sustainability as money is really tight and in order to not draw unpleasant attention from authorities it is important for Egyptian grassroots initiatives to steer clear of \"foreign\" money. Right now they have two full time hosts that are employed by a local institution (I think) in a kind of indirect support, resource sharing in a very direct way:\n\n<em>\"We don't have employees as you mentioned, but we're in partnership with some organizations that help us in the placement of passionate workers for a certain period of time at Mesaha to help in managing the space and to work on definite assignments to develop Mesaha. ( Current partners: Action Aid global platform from Jordan - and Lazurd fellowship, Gerhard center, AUC)\"</em>\n\n<span>I'll get back in touch with them and follow up on our conversation, </span>leave questions in the comments please so I can build a good case study to share!\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Rasheed 22</h3>\n\nHazem and I took the metro (works pretty well by the way) across town to Heliopolis where you find \u00a0<a href=\"/u/labanita\">@labanita</a>'s Rasheed22 coworking space in a charming old building. When we walked in Ulli mentioned the space was undergoing some changes as they were in the process of setting up a pickup point for organic farm deliveries in the space.\u00a0\n\nAs I write this I realise I never asked Ulli how they got started, how the space is run and what kind of initatives they run. It's clear they do a lot of different things though: The venue is filled with prototypes of all kinds of products, from locally produced organic energy bars to bags made from recycled event banners (the kind you hang on top of the stage at conferences).\u00a0I'll need to look up the documentation from Spot The Future to see if I can find the basics...\n\nWhat I did gather is that some of the challenges are ones faced by anyone running any kind of community platform, whether it is a physical space or an online one. That of building a shared working culture and sense of personal responsibility for maintaining and developing common infrastructures which enable the work...More soon here\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Megawra</h3>\n\nThe story of reviving\u00a0al-Khalifa area and the community service centre <a href=\"/t/draft-megawra-a-community-onion-with-many-layers/4678\">here</a>.\u00a0\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Cairo Hackerspace</h3>\n\nComing soon...\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">Nafham</h3>\n\nSee Case Study &amp; notes <a href=\"/en/node-4554/draft-nafham-peer-to-peer-online-education-in-egypt\">here</a>\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-09 14:19:37", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:25.591065", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1261, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 66.6, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2565, 2201, 1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 887, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 854, "post_number": 1, "raw": "When doing the research for the current<strong> <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/campaign/we-people\" title=\"We, The People\">We, the People</a></strong> campaign we came across some in some interesting figures; while only 5 percent of Europeans under 30 are active in a political party or organisation, three times more are involved with an organization promoting human rights or local/global community development.\u00a0 It seems many\u00a0 are attempting to affect change directly by getting involved in organizations and or projects that address specific issues, rather than relying on political representatives or institutions to do it for them.\u00a0 And so it makes sense to explore this space in more detail.\u00a0 If you self identify as a change-agent and or are curious about what others are up to I encourage you to participate in the S<a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/making-living/spotlight-social-innovation\">potlight Social Innovation mission</a> .\n\nIt is against this backdrop that I participated in \\#we_b, a workshop exploring possibilities for collaboration amongst different actors i<span>n accelerating social impact</span>.

Below I have tried to summarise the main themes, questions and approaches that emerged during a skillfully facilitated day.\n\n<a href=\"http://edgedev.eu/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Edgeryders_Workshop_We_B.011.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1673\" height=\"768\" src=\"http://edgedev.eu/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Edgeryders_Workshop_We_B.011.png\" title=\"Edgeryders_Workshop_We_B.011\" width=\"1024\"></a>Above is a quick illustration of the broad areas of interest that emerged as being relevant to most, if not all, of the workshop participants as a result of the skillfully facilitated morning discussion. Later in the afternoon we broke off into three parallel sessions, one dedicated to each topic and questions:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Creating <strong>employment for change-maker talent</strong>; is society ready for skills to be deployed in other places than entrepreneurship? If so, where are we seeing evidence of this?\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/christinasworld\">@christinasworld</a>: the We alliance, amplifying collective impact on women, webbed empowerment centers, we-men- how to involve men.</li>\n\n</ul></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Achieving Impact at Scale</strong> : what kind of scale are we talking about? more growth, more diversity? What new perspectives are there on evaluating impact?\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Discussion lead by <a href=\"http://twitter.com/nurturegirl\">@nurturegirl</a>: thrivability- evolving a model that allows us to set expectations and metrics to evaluate actions and their consequences on social systems</li>\n\n<li>Presentation by\u00a0<a href=\"http://twitter.com/christellevh\">@christellevh</a>: how risk management offers a new perspective on evaluating impact</li>\n\n</ul></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Connect &amp; Act</strong>: Building impact on personal relationships, peer learning and peer development\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Introduction to processes, methods and tools for structured and goal- specific exploration and growing of personal networks lead by <a href=\"http://twitter.com/appliedwisdom\">@appliedwisdom</a></li>\n\n<li>Introduction to Edgeryders: Online collaborative policy making and peer-2-peer coaching for change-agents.</li>\n\n</ul></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Social starts with the personal:</h2>\n\nLooking back what is immediately strikes me is the many parallels between the discussions,questions, themes and approaches raised in the workshop- and how Edgeryders is designed (and evolving).\u00a0 What is clear is that there is a need for the individuals active in the Social Impact space to share and learn from each other's journeys and experiences: as well as individuals as well as agents in personal stories.\n\n<a href=\"http://edgedev.eu/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-shot-2012-01-17-at-12.00.05-AM.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1681 aligncenter\" height=\"225\" src=\"http://edgedev.eu/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-shot-2012-01-17-at-12.00.05-AM.png\" title=\"Screen shot 2012-01-17 at 12.00.05 AM\" width=\"1086\"></a> One of the questions that I recieved in response to my tweets reporting from \\#we_b\u00a0 was the one above.

Their concern is exacerbated by the failure of national governments to do so.\n\nTo this end and in that light and in light of the probable weakening of national governance that will accompany the eruption of large scale resilience threats the RF has launched a program centred on cities with a view to establishing a community that will be, at the end of the program, a self sustaining and expanding network of resilient aware and prepared cities.\n\nThey have set aside 100 millionUSD to be spent over a sustained period on 100 cities . A large fraction of this money will be spent on and within the municipalities bureaucracies and infrastructures. An equally large fraction will be spent on developing the network amongst the cities on conferences, reports, procedures, websites, software programs and data sets.\n\nThe principal requirement of each accepted city will be to recruit to a NEW post a full time resilience officer who reports directly to the most senior municipal officer (which in the case of Cork would be the City Manager). The principal direct benefit of the program is that RF will pay the whole of this person's salary and other employment costs for the first years of this post until the value and utility of such an officer can be demonstrated. \n\nYou should be aware that this not a \"cheque in the post\" type lottery. Nor is it guaranteed that 1 million USD will spent in each city. Equally, given the talents and resources available in Cork there is every chance that a significant part of funds could disbursed here.\n\nRegistration and application costs nothing, does not have to be done directly by the city and requires only that the applying city fully endorse the application and commit to supporting and fully participating in the program.\n\nCork's history, current culture and awareness, and topography make it an excellent candidate city. Although Cork is living under the same economic constraints as us all, there is a strong network of colleagues in the city, county, national and international resilence organisations that are eager and able to assist, support and participate in the application process and, hopefully, in the actual program so as to maximise the benefit for Cork and for the resilience movement in Ireland.\n\nThe deadline for registration is Sept 23rd and for application is mid-October. Again, may  I remind you that both are costless and require no ongoing commitment. Clearly, in order to submit as good an application as possible it would helpful if some be travel and accommodation costs could be met but I do not see that any consultancy fees are required.\n\nI am available to talk or meet should you have any questions. \n\nHere is the link to the registration page. The application page is available only to those cities that qualify ( population above 50,000) and whose registrations are accepted. \n\nhttp://100resilientcities.rockefellerfoundation.org/pages/for-cities", "created_at": "2013-09-13 11:49:16", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:52.891798", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 536, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8956, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 2344, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Yaay, well done!</b>\n\nBravo Ilaria and all, super happy to hear this!

Il ne faudrait surtout pas vous fier \u00e0 ce que vous r\u00e9v\u00e9leront vos yeux, si jamais vous rencontrez <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/users/alessia-zabatino\">Alessia Zabatino</a>, qui se passionne pour l'innovation sociale. L'\u00e9l\u00e9gante jeune italienne est gracieuse comme une ballerine. Elle est fr\u00eale. Elle est menue. Mais elle est si vive! Sa force - son secret que je crois avoir perc\u00e9 - ce qui lui permet de reconsid\u00e9rer toutes choses, d'o\u00f9 jaillit sa cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 et d'o\u00f9 provient sa facult\u00e9 de remise en cause perp\u00e9tuelle, elle la puise dans la grandeur de ce qu'il y a \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur d'elle. Car pour arriver \u00e0 faire cela, il faut pouvoir vivre sans limite. Je ne veux pas dire de vivre comme dans un film de James Bond. Vivre dangereusement. Pas du tout. Je parle de la libert\u00e9 de l'esprit, l'absence de barri\u00e8res, l'esprit en expansion.\n\nImmobilisme, corruption, mafia, aversion au risque, sont autant de facteurs qui freinent l\u2019\u00e9volution des gouvernements et des organisations, et qui ont pouss\u00e9 Alessia \u00e0 pr\u00eacher la cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 et la collaboration. Le dialogue entre les acteurs, internes et externes, s'av\u00e8re un incontournable \u00e0 ses yeux. Elle cherche \u00e0 engager les individus dans la transformation. En tentant de motiver l'intelligence collective, Alessia esp\u00e8re modifier les vielles valeurs ancr\u00e9es dans la culture des gouvernements.\n\nComment surmonter les fortes rigidit\u00e9s au changement? Elle a d'abord tent\u00e9 d'influencer les autorit\u00e9s en manifestant dans les rues. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 rudement secou\u00e9e lors d'une manifestation, au point de se rompre les os. \u00ab<em>Je me sentais vaincue, d\u00e9sillusionn\u00e9e</em>\u00bb, a-t-elle confi\u00e9. Cela aurait pu \u00eatre amplement suffisant pour lui couper tout int\u00e9r\u00eat pour l'am\u00e9lioration des politiques gouvernementales. Cependant, l'ardent d\u00e9sir gronde de plus belle en Alessia, qui ne retournera probablement pas dans les rues, mais elle continue n\u00e9anmoins de chercher des fa\u00e7ons d'amener une prise de conscience \u00e0 propos du concept d'intelligence sociale. Pour Alessia, la cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 est le levier de renouvellement des syst\u00e8mes. Elle se distingue par une d\u00e9marche de diff\u00e9renciation. Il ne lui reste plus qu'\u00e0 moduler l'intensit\u00e9 de chacun des volets dans le syst\u00e8me d'imbrication, et de dimensionner au mieux l'approche de transformation vers plus d'agilit\u00e9.\n\nJe comprends Alessia un peu mieux, maintenant que j'aper\u00e7ois son esprit tendant vers l'absence de limites --- ce qui est par ailleurs la v\u00e9ritable nature de notre esprit, et ce vers quoi nous devrions tous tendre. Je comprends pourquoi elle parle de \u00ab<a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/reality-check/mission_case/evaluation-broke-education\">ses prisons</a>\u00bb, et j'entrevois aussi pourquoi elle s'est fait reprocher d'\u00eatre \u00abtrop bonne\u00bb et \u00abtrop performante \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole\u00bb. C'est un reproche que j'entends souvent \u00e0 mon sujet \u00e9galement. Alessia, j'ai envie de te dire de croire en toi.

I started in Economics at Reed College and later was a student in Cognitive Science and Philosophy of Science and Technology. My thesis was a minimalist theory of infrastructures for collaboratively producing our world, with ethical orientation toward radical demographic inclusion: how we can live in a society much like ours but where the neurosurgeon and the toilet-cleaner have equal power and participation.\n\nAfter spending the last couple years dreaming through the more basic features of this problem at an intensive Zen monastery, I decided that my mission now is to grow a robust meta-culture of open-sourcing everything. LOTE people seem like the right ones to work with on this very unknown problem. Open-sourcing everything allows us to fail more, fail faster, and fail together.\n\nThe social forms and mechanics of the open-source mindset make it easy to trace failures, learn from them, and design more robust iterations. I think the really expensive failures, the ones that are most destructive, are the ones that are ambiguous or invisible. Cultivating a culture of open-source everything familiarizes us with common patterns of failure and omission by their repeated appearance.\u00a0\n\nThe culture of an open-source world is fundamentally a culture of rational experimentation and lightweight solutions. It's a method for getting peer-reviewed solutions to any conceivable problem and refining that solution into a reusable working part to be inherited by other systems. But as much as it excels in finding \"optimal\" solutions, it also aids us all in embracing diversity by letting us clearly see how different tribes do things differently for their own good reasons.\n\nI would like to give LOTE participants some simple masscollab/open-source thinking tools and demonstrate practical forms of contribution to an open-source world. I want this session to be a collective realization both of practical forms of open-sourcing in the domains and communities to which we each belong, and of the general principles necessary to responsibly translate the tools and mediums of open-source to the rest of the world.\n\nHere's how the session might unfold:\n\nI'll demonstrate how \"open-sourcing\" anything is the same as \"networking\" it, and I'll convey intuitive proofs of the efficiency and accompanying societal wealth inherent in dot-connecting \"network effects\". I'll frame open-sourcing as a big-minded creative labor that teaches collectivity-consciousness while producing social facilities that increase in value exponentially. Although participants need not have any experience with software development, I will use metaphorical analogies to APIs, protocols, \"forking\"/versioning, and long-term interoperability best practices.\n\nI'll show how to perform this craft of networking the world in forms granular enough and in mediums organic enough to remain usable across time and free from technological provincialization. I'll teach that anyone can \"open source\" what they're familiar with by documenting it in forms and mediums that are \"friendly\" to networked collaboration. And I'll stimulate the imagination to consider open-sourcing places, communities, social forms, materials, learning, and collaboration tools themselves in ways that the largest cross-section of humanity can replicate, localize, and own as both users and designers.\n\nI'll give a simple theory of projects, examining the sources and barriers of expertise, funding, momentum, and localization, as a microcosm of mass collaboration. I'll explore the philosophy of patterns, replication, and the creation of new categories of things in the world by analogy to genomics and ecosystems, and \"impossible scenarios\" that are made possible by radically shrinking the \"transaction overhead costs\" of high-N coordination problems. Finally I'll point out some statistical and imaginative arguments that demonstrate the potential of massive open collaboration to eliminate the causes of myriad exploitative systems by enabling widespread local self-sufficiency.\n\nAnyone with similar interests or a strong intuition about this session please get in touch with me ASAP to help tailor it deeply to the needs of LOTE participants. Ideally this session can hold value to every other social innovation at LOTE since it aims to generalize (or commoditize!) social innovation itself.\n\nI'll reference the work of Bruno Latour, Christopher Alexander, Yochai Benkler, and Alexander Galloway for further reading.\n\nDate: 2016-02-26 08:00:00 - 2016-02-26 08:00:00, America/Los_Angeles Time.", "created_at": "2016-01-30 17:37:08", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:30.328666", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 759, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 90.8, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 41, 3067, 97, 4861], "is_private": false}, {"id": 633, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 600, "post_number": 1, "raw": "**_Available in: :gb: [English](#en) / :ro: [Romanian](#ro)_**\n\n----------\n\n## :gb: **_English version_** <a name=\"en\"></a>\n\nEdgeryders in Romania taking action for change, helping ourselves grow as a community, become each other's resource and build durable projects together.

What we did so far:\n\n* collected beautiful stories of beautiful people and shared them in this group. \n\n* met offline, cooked together, biked together, and supported one another's initiatives\n\n* hosted a [workshop on collaboration](/t/call-for-participation-futurespotters-bucharest-int-l-workshop-9-10-july/4517) in 2015 with 35 community members attending. Everyone contributed to make it happen! Takeaways [here.](/t/what-are-your-take-aways-from-futurespotters-workshop/4645)\n\n* organized more informal meetups on several topics and partnered up with local events like Babele.co and OuiShare drinks, Hey M\u0103rie's Sez\u0103toare, Noaptea Caselor.\n\nWelcome on board!

It encouraged me to think that we would succeed in launching projects. That would be able to create jobs (beginning with our own jobs).\n\nCreate jobs around open government principles and philosophy, we tried to develop this market as much as we could over the past year. At one point, I seriously wondered if I lacked skills in business development.\u00a0 This Summer, I was really upset at myself! The methods I used for many years \u2015 they worked well enough all my life \u2015 have yielded no tangible financial results.\n\nIn Quebec, we can count on the fingers of one hand the number of jobs that exist in this area. Diane Mercier from City of Montreal (<a href=\"http://ca.linkedin.com/in/dianemercier\">http://ca.linkedin.com/in/dianemercier</a>). Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Gauthier from Loran Technologies (<a href=\"http://ca.linkedin.com/in/jeanfrancoisgauthier\">http://ca.linkedin.com/in/jeanfrancoisgauthier</a>), they apparently got a contract with one of the 100 ministries and government institutions. I cannot think of anyone else. Maybe one or two employees were hired temporarily by the Gautrin group?\n\nI asked the government of Quebec to grant me access to its program for self-employed workers, so that I could create my own job in the opengov field. I carefully examined each of the criteria of this program. I thought that I was eligible.\n\nFirst, they ignored me for 3 months. I asked to meet in person with the general director of the organisation mandated for this program management in my area. Their team refused to see me. They set up interviews with all the candidates that apply to this program, but they refused to meet with me. I called Emploi Qu\u00e9bec. They said that I had to get an interview with this organisation, there was no other organisation but this one in charge of the program in my area. Instead of taking a decision, the general director demanded that a member of the National Assembly of Quebec take the decision for him! The MP contacted transfered me to another MP. The final answer arrived on September 1st, twenty days prior to the Open Government Partnership launch at UN in New York: 'The project does not fit entrepreneur criteria'. What?! At the same period, 46 countries have lined up behind the OGP project.\n\nThere is something obviously very wrong here...\n\nI fit the group of 'non-technical' workers, good commmunicator, great listener, and passionate about achieving results. that you mention, John. I believe I have these skills. But this does not lead to any job in my country.\n\n<div class=\"almost_half_cell\" id=\"gt-res-content\"><div style=\"zoom:1\"><span><span>A member</span> <span>of the National Assembly</span> was even asked <span>to intervene, to</span> <span>block me</span> <span>access to</span> <span>employment</span><span>.</span></span></div></div>\n\nWhat to do?\n\n<div class=\"almost_half_cell\" id=\"gt-res-content\">\n\n<div style=\"\">\u00a0</div>I know.

Or if you even acknowledge that. There's no harm is pointing stuff out (the Legals, or many of the like pages, got lost in the various moving around of stuff on the site, you know how it is), just like there's no harm in fixing it in good faith.\n\n<em>Over 2 years, next to no effort has been made to expand the board, or open out the governance structure - I think this is a major contributor to discontent on the part of those who view LBG as wielding too much power.</em>\n\nLote3 session\u00a0<a href=\"/t/hire-yourself-using-edgeryders-as-a-corporate-shell-for-your-projects/2006\">Hire yourself</a>? to keep the doors open for anyone to bring in stuff they care about - including <strong>another company stewarding and helping grow the community - sharing costs, responsibility, resources and \"power\", whatever you mean by that</strong>. Aside from that, the company is so small, what promises can we make if we don't even know if it's viable or not, yet? What stops others from proposing new governance structures, or improvements to this one? I don't understand where the friction is.\u00a0\n\nWhat about the argument <a href=\"/t/a-list-of-recent-acts-of-resources-sharing-and-transparency-from-edgeryders-lbg-to-the-community/4279\">documenting transparency </a>efforts? It seems to me that one is stronger than power \"perceptions\".\n\n<em>Who defines the meaning of \u2018community\u2019 on EdgeRyders? (There has been a continuous shift between representing LBG and community. LBG directors consistently fail to represent the company viewpoint as unique and not necessarily the same as community)</em>\n\nWe know already from past discussions that the effort to define \"the community\" in one unique way is futile (search for \"governance\" or Dante's threads in particular where we clearly disagree).\u00a0\n\n\"consistently fail to represent\" is harsh, even for you since you've been around, we worked together and you bring this up now.. I can only say, where I'm concerned, that if you point me to where I wrote something you disagreed with I will re-consider or change my formulation.\u00a0\n\nFrom someone building community, there is preference for an inclusive language pointing to what unites us- the story of we versus I or you in community building - as opposed to positioning ourselves through differentiation.

Focus on finding resources is not the same as generating revenue for the sake of revenue. Lote hasn't been discarded, I completely disagree with the way you make it sound. Who ever stopped anyone from building Lote or why building it becomes a demand you make from ER LBG is beyond me.. you know we did this together, you know it's a community effort, you know that we are open to ever new formats, and you don't know it's not happening this year (<a href=\"/t/fast-forward-through-community-calls-april-dec-2015/4276\">on the contrary</a>).

The idea I think is that if we in ER LbG operational go cuckoo, the community will walk away, and there will be nowhere to move forward. The fact that people in the board disagree doesn't mean someone is vicious. Asta and Vinay should be in a position to say if they viewed ER LbG operational as being abusive to the community.

Skills required for operational strategies consist of conventional measures.\n\nWhereas <strong>transformational</strong> strategies take place when governments or businesses are able to face significant uncertainty, by aiming to change the game or culture, and therefore must address substantial channel or new types of challenges. By contrast, transformational strategies are much more difficult to achieve, because they require to use insufficient information to take options-based decisions about priorities, investments, configuration of systems, partnerships, etc. <span><span>We</span> <span>have little</span> <span>understanding</span> <span>of</span></span><span> <span>kind of</span> <span>transformational</span> <span>power</span> <span>is obtained</span> <span>where,</span> <span>under what circumstances</span><span>,</span> and <span>by whom.</span></span>\n\n<span><span>The </span>idea of letting go of some of their <span>power</span> to transfer it to grassroots scares many decision makers and officials<span>.</span> <span>Only those</span> <span>at the top of</span> <span>the ladder, in the higher spheres, </span><span>have</span> <span>been entitled</span> <span>to</span> <span>cumulate</span><span> power (and they often get obsessed with it and they want more).

CONFIDENCE\n\nStaying motivated is a struggle. It is likely that drive gets constantly assaulted by negative thoughts and anxiety about the future. Everyone faces doubt and depression, but what distinguishes a motivated individual is the ability to keep moving forward.\n\nThe key is understanding thoughts and how they drive emotions. By learning how to nurture motivating thoughts, neutralize negative ones, and focus on the task at hand, it is possible to pull ourselves out of a slump before it gains momentum.\n\nTo get away from the thought pattern of becoming jealous of competitors and making excuses for why I can\u2019t succeed, I focus on gratitude. This means that I aside time to focus on everything positive in my life.\n\nBy making an effort to feel grateful, it helps me realize how competent I already am. This rejuvenates my confidence and gets me motivated to build on what I have.\n\nIt might sound strange to several people that repeating things you already know improves mindset, but it is amazingly effective! The mind distorts reality to confirm what it wants to believe. The more NEGATIVELY someone thinks, the more examples the mind discovers to confirm that belief.\n\nCONQUER THE FEAR\n\nWe normally think in terms of fear: I\u2019m afraid of being poor. I\u2019m afraid no one will grant me recognition for my efforts. I\u2019m afraid of being alone. Etc.\n\nThe problem with this type of thinking is that fear alone isn\u2019t actionable. It feeds on itself and drains motivation.\n\nBy defining a goal, it helps me define a set of actions.\n\n<strong>I stop thinking. </strong>I just do it.\n\n<img alt=\"\"

THE LEVEL OF JOY\n\nChanging an average life into a passionate, purpose-filled, exciting journey is possible.\n\nI make joy my \\#1 priority. This means that Joy is for Today, not Tomorrow.\n\nThe minute I feel less-than-joyful, I focus on my thoughts, I discipline my thoughts, and I force myselft to return to the state of joy. Contrary to popular belief, joy is not just the result of some sort of mystical coming together of favorable factors, but is the result of continually choosing to be in a certain thought alignment.\n\nI have very simple tricks to constantly be in a state of joy, like singing really loudly in my car. I spend several hours a week in my car. Every time I drive, I sing out loud. Not just in my head, I use all the power of my voice. While I sing, I tend to have less negative thoughts. Spend 20 minutes to sing as loud as you can, then give me some news! You see, you'll probably be joyful...\n\nKEEP GOOD COMPANY\n\nMaking regular encounters with positive and motivated people really help me maintain my self-motivation. This can be as simple as participating to chats with peers or having a quick discussion with a friend, who likes sharing ideas.\n\n", "created_at": "2011-12-20 15:06:26", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:10.274413", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 13081, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [7331], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28597, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4255, "post_number": 11, "raw": "<b>Work is always useful</b>\n\nI never implied your work (or anyone's) is not useful. On the contrary, it is because I appreciate it so much that I insist we stay well away from the <a href=\"http://dilbert.com/strip/2008-10-02\">Dilbert-ish nightmare</a> in which everyone is a supervisor of someone else, and people focus on overseeing others instead of building stuff. Oversight is important \u2013 that's why we recruit nonexecs \u2013 but work is the real scarce resource. Hence the structure we have now, where no one is holding anyone back, and the only sanctioned brake people are the two non-execs<em>.</em> Have you thought of trying a different structure in the newly minted unMonastery LBG? Then, in a year or two, we could compare notes.\n\nThe company's relationship to the projects on the platform is explained <a href=\"/t/edgeryders-as-social-enterprise-what-you-can-do-with-it/1044\">here</a> (2013) and\u00a0<a href=\"/t/administration-er-lbg/335/the-business-corporation-as-a-symbiont-to-a-community-edgeryders-crosses-a\">here</a> (2014). It boils down to the usual \"who does the work calls the shots\", with the additional provision \"no veto power\". Your work, your project, your decision. In more detail:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>If you don't need the Edgeryders LBG corporate shell to realize your project, you have no need to engage the company. You can still tell the world (if that helps you) that you are involved in the Edgeryders (not LBG) community, and use the ER red logo. It is licensed under a creative commons license, so you don't need anyone's permission.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>If you do need the Edgeryders LBG corporate shell (like, originally, Economy App, Viral Academy, and unMonastery in Matera) then you do need to talk to the company, because any contract or other legal document needs to be signed by someone in the ER LBG board to be valid. But even in that case, we would request that you lead your own project (like Matt did for the Economy App and David for VA. In the unMonastery Matera case there was a larger investment from myself and other directors, because no one person or group could or would do the fundraising part. So we did that instead, but Ben still was asked to commit to being on site).\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>If after having been \"incubated\" by ER LBG your project grows so that it needs its own organization, that's good news! You are welcome to set one up, with our congratulations, and again you don't need anyone's permission. This was the case for the Economy App when it became the Makerfox, and now for unMonastery LBG. Hopefully, you will want to contribute back to the community, so that more projects can become as successful as yours. A good way to contribute to the community is by offering opportunities to do meaningful, paid work, and do so in an open way (like public calls). The more community projects become successful and generate opportunities for the community, the better! There can and should be more than one company operating in symbiosis with the community and serving it; the community should be unique for maximum diversity and critical mass.</li>\n\n<li>No, the fact that you have a project group on Edgeryders does not mean you are working for Edgeryders LBG. The GitHub example serves again: I have my own GitHub user, and Edgeryders as an organization is also present on GitHub. You guessed it: we still don't work for GitHub.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n\u200bEdgeryders LBG is not much of a political player. You are now in our admin group, and you see that we talk about client relationships, finding cheaper banking, getting proposals in, preparing reports: necessary work, but hardly exciting. We are doing <a href=\"/t/market-activism/3006\">market activism</a>, i.e.\u00a0trying to generate opportunities to operate the change we want to see <em>and get paid for it</em>. Money changing hands (\"market\") means the force driving change is sustainable over time. These opportunities are not appropriated by the people who generated it, but reshared with the community: the unMonastery residency opportunity are the perfect example.

(It looks like people on the ground need help from their managers, and managers need some gentle oversight from donors.)\n\nIn any case, international agents should end up improving their action. What does it look like? Should they be doing less, more, different? Earlier, later? How? It may boil down to a matter of respect. Respect for the situation's complexity and for the people's agency. The devil is of course in the details.\n\nOn another post, someone mentioned how a political party of young people just left their political action to the side, used their own organisation, and got going. They found challenges in \"shared prioritisation\" which in some circumstances slowed them down. I don't know how they'll be doing the \"after quake\" work.\n\nTo that post, I suggested it might be useful to use some \"language of needs\". A language would be something neutral for all participants. It would allow those in need to express their needs in that language, and those able to help to say what they might contribute. The neutrality of such a language might help clarify the need for respect and make it operational. (Maybe.)\n\nI have personally used such a language in a theoretical (so far) situation, in which state actors would be overwhelmed and there would be a need for those standing up (mostly locals, but with different agendas until the moment the crisis hits) to organise themselves around whatever needs appear (or are clearly visible in the short and medium term) as a result of the crisis. http://www.resiliencemaps.org links to \"pandemic in the macaronesia\".\n\nIn short, imagine we look at what's on the ground, and local leaders say something like this. We've scanned our needs:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>at the individual level, and there's enough water indefinitely because we have a clear river, we need shelter for the monsoon and later for winter for 450 families, and (say) 27 of us need insulin etc;</li>\n\n<li>at the group level, we need a number of solar phone chargers and a way to move stuff across this valley;</li>\n\n<li>at the organisation level, we need (say) Red Cross and MSF to coordinate among themselves because up until now they have duplicated their supplies and not brought some things that were needed.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nIdeally, everyone (locals in need, same-country helpers, international helpers) would be able to work with that information, reducing misinformation (including perception gaps), and fostering a sense of objectivity and people-need centeredness.\n\nI realise SCIM (the language put forward in ResilienceMaps, of which the previous paragraph is an example) is heavily focused on \"vital infrastructure\". There are also emotional needs (PTSD), cultural issues (though \"language\" may fall under \"communication infrastructure\"?), and other issues. But maybe the notion of a \"language of needs\" might help?\n\nIf felt to be so, is there such a language already? Could a light template be designed? Or maybe it's just a matter of linking initiatives like what you've described with the 220 initiatives turned into a database of mutually seeing people? (It does feel like a most interesting approach. Particularly if the less-connected have proxies who help them enter the conversation as fully as possible.)\n\nI feel we're all learning from what works and from further reflection. Thank you.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-13 19:06:03", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:50.841420", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 657, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 6.8, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2551, 2687, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24486, "user_id": 1687, "topic_id": 3779, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>adding another session</b>\n\nHow can I add another session?

But the project is touching almost all the big cities in a first step and aim to become national.\n\nWhat do they do : One of the biggest social problems in Morocco is Education. In poor neighborhoods, the parents do not often take care of their children. The law of the street is the one educating them because they spend a lot of time on it, playing football or just chillig with their mates.\n\nWhat this people do, is that they create illustrated books with usual situations that those childs live every day, and distribute them to the parents and children with a big work of sensibilisation. These books are very close to these people becauses they treat subjects that touch them directly.\n\nThis operation is a big success as the stories in the books are becoming an oral heritage and the parents and childs recognize themselves in those books.\n\nBelow a resume of the interview i had with Mr Driss Massaoudi, a jounalist, activist, and founder of this project. And some links to understand better the project (in Fr)\n\n<strong><em><u>Answers of Mr Driss Messaoudi, on behalf of the cultural and social action Workshop Kenitra, atacs-K, designer and implementer of the project \"Deliver Us to Books / Mothers and Children First! \"</u></em></strong>\n\n\u2022 How did you start and what is the current situation?\n\nI started with the idea that the book could serve as an instrument of social therapy, adopting some features of form and substance. This approach allowed me to give greater breadth and scope to my field actions in raising awareness and guidance of certain population groups: people with disabilities, early school leavers or pre delinquency ...\n\nCurrently, through the partnership with Ecology Action association, cultural, social and online marketing company, the first batch of 5,000 copies of three tracks from this concept is being printed for commercial distribution.\n\nThe books in question treat 1 / of the popular culture of the fishing trips with friends, 2 / the noble tradition of the master craftsman, and 3 / the respect of animals as part of an ecological approach.\n\n<strong>\u2022 Who is involved: Who is in the team? Roles and responsibilities? Skill levels, partnerships?</strong>\n\nThis project is part of an informal structure for now but what is intended, is to be institutionalized as an association.\n\nFor now it\u2019s a \"cultural and social action workshop\", an informal cooperative multidisciplinary, bringing together people of good will, and each one identifying itself the area of \u200b\u200bexpertise and responsibility he is able to ensure and assume, from a comprehensive presentation of the project in all its dimensions and issues.\n\nThe team now has fifteen people and dynamic partnership regularly gains in power, due to a strategy of openness and systematic collaboration.\n\nParticularly with regard to authors, writers, illustrators and graphic designers, to give life to the ideas of books inspired by the guiding concept of the project.\n\n<strong>Short / Medium Term Projection: \"I believe that to achieve x, we must do it through z\"</strong>\n\nTo prove that the book is a better social therapy vector that ICTs, it remains to convince NGOs to adopt it as awareness campaign support or awareness on such a unifying theme as possible.\n\n<strong>What are your main goals / why you do this?</strong>\n\nThe main objective is to make the book a vector of civilization, which involves feeding the book publishing market a sufficiently attractive product concept. A project driven by the belief that the book is actually the best friend of man.\n\n<strong><em>\u2022 What do you enjoy about the job and what you like least?</em></strong>\n\nThe most significant is obviously the wealth of human contact that such social engineering makes living in one hand and capitalize on the other.\n\nThe less pleasant part is to take over the suffering generated by the various social pathologies that this project proposes to deal.\n\n<strong><em>\u2022 What types of tasks you do on a regular basis? Yearly, monthly, weekly, daily</em></strong>\n\nDaily<strong>:</strong> meetings and contacts, identification of needs, case studies, field work,\n\nWeekly: operational briefings and debriefings, design and screenwriting, producing and directing.\n\nMonthly basis: upgrade new employees and team members\n\nAnnual Basis: evaluation of actions and planning.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong><em>\u2022 What, other than money, do you think could help you in your work?</em></strong>\n\nInstitutional and operational partnership with NGOs of international scope; the official government support.\n\n<strong><em>\u2022 What help can you give to others and under what conditions (assuming no money involved)?</em></strong>\n\nDesign and produce books that can serve as carriers and vectors of social and cultural action projects in the conditions of a functional partnership of general interest.\n\n<strong><em><u>WHAT SHOULD KNOW THOSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO REALLY UNDERSTAND YOUR JOB?</u></em></strong>\n\n<strong><em>\u2022 Products or services you produce now?</em></strong>\n\n<strong><em>Illustrated books vocation of social therapy. Social and cultural framework of actions targeted populations.</em></strong>\n\n<strong><em>\u2022 How are you going to lead your project? What are the steps? Technologies or processes used?</em></strong>\n\nProspecting in the sphere of NGOs to establish partnerships aimed at making the book a support vector of cultural and social activities, awareness to therapy.\n\nFirst step, performed: implementation of a cultural and social action workshop service specializing in artisanal publishing illustrated books; along the lines of income generating activities (pilot workshop, reproducible concept on a large scale), allowing its participants to have a professional activity generating income practicable at home (making handicrafts books from boards printed in fashion PAO)\n\nStep 2, being: publication and dissemination under the name of a publishing house partner of the project of a first series of 5000 books, divided between the first three titles of a new concept of popular literature: the books \"imagiques \"that emphasize the image to text so strongly draw the attention by creating an equally strong emotion and reflection, a prelude to the awakening of the acting consciences ...\n\nStep 3 in progress: extension of the pilot area implementation from concept to large areas of population. For example, partnership for with large real estate companies managing \"economic\" housing programs in order to contribute decisively to urbanization projects from rural populations in particular by the widespread dissemination of a \"illustrated Guide of urban life\" under design.\n\n<strong><em>\u2022 Costs: What expenses are involved? Who benefits from the work? Which currently supports, how and why?</em></strong>\n\nThis project have as a goal the creation and entry into service of a team of ten people charged with ensuring the distribution door to door of the awareness books in question, in this case the third book of the first series, devoted to \"wild\" football practiced by children and young adults on street corners, causing more and more trouble to local residents ...\n\nThe budget for this action is 500,000 Dh annually.\n\nThe beneficiaries of this project are first employees.\n\nThe operating budget since the start of implementation to two years ago is powered by : one third in personal funds; another third by corporate sponsorship; third part: private sponsorship.\n\n<strong><em>\u2022 Existing Alternatives: Who else is doing similar or related work / offering similar things- locally or elsewhere?</em></strong>\n\nNo one.\n\n<strong><em>\u2022 Significant actors that affect your work?

I was born in a small Italian city, the kind that many of us want to escape from because they are claustrophobic, conservative, with no real opportunities for people who think \u2018outside the box\u2019. I was always a bit weird, compared to many of my friends, in that I spoke English with my mum at home, an oddity which I was ashamed of at the time, but which became my passport to the world. Since I was a child, I wanted to do something that made me travel and made the world a better place. When I was a little older than a teenager, after finishing my studies at Bologna and Sussex Universities (Erasmus, what a blessing), I decided to move to London and look for work in the international development/NGO field. I had this idea of me working in some remote African village, building wells, teaching kids, distributing food aid. And I am proud to say that - after a miserable start stuffing envelops for a Britsh NGO for 6 months - I had my first breakthrough: an assistant job, working closely with the field officers and the local partners. I started climbing \u2018the ladder\u2019, meaning I started getting better jobs, going abroad, learning new skills in project management, fundraising, communication and whatnot. It was an exciting time, working hard paid off, and I had no one to thank but myself.</span>\n\n<span>However, a little voice in my head started telling me that there was something wrong. I didn\u2019t like many things, from the fact that I was managing projects and handing out money to people who didn\u2019t really want to talk about \u2018participatory assessments\u2019, but wanted a job and live in a dignified way with their families and friends. People who really just wanted what everyone else wants: enough money for food and a nice house, plus maybe a little extra cash for some fun. There was such moralist attitude in many people I met - especially those who handed out the cash for these projects - the kind that goes \u201cYou are poor, you don\u2019t really know what you need\u201d. And then there were the power-dynamics, the politics, the hypocrisy, the patronising attitude ('but they are soooo happy, in their villages! I really wish we could be more like them!\"). </span>\n\n<span>Us and them. The white and the black. The European and the rest. The civilised and the ones who are on their way to becoming so (the fantastic expression \"developing countries\", tinged with political correctedness in opposition to \"Third World\", which was just another way of saying \"c'mon guys, try to be a little more like us and you'll be just fine!\"). Except, that they were not, despite years of \"development\", getting any better - if anything worse - and \"we\" (the rich ones) were just doing the same thing over, and over and over. A little disgusted by it all,</span> <span>I decided to embark on a <em>transition</em>. I still wanted to \u2018help the world\u2019, but I wanted to do it in a smarter way, and I wanted to do it with people who were doing it in a smarter way. </span><span>A lot of stuff was changing in the world at the time - Seattle, Genoa, then 9/11 - which somehow made the world look harder, more hostile and combative. </span><span>This was more or less the time when I discovered social entrepreneurship, this world of people who started companies </span><span>and made money while helping the world at the same time. </span><span> I decided that this was the area I wanted to explore. I left my paid, full time job, started doing odd consultancies here and there, started asking myself questions, went back to school to try to answer some of these questions (didn't, but learned a lot of answers other people had cooked up) </span><span>and then set off looking for adventure. </span>\n\n<span>As it happens, adventure came my way, after a series of twists and turns (if you leave a door open to the world, you never know what might come in!). This adventure was called <a href=\"http://www.the-hub.net/\">The Hub</a>. I became fascinated with the idea of a place where people like me could meet, could come up with ideas, projects, even businesses, that could make the world better. I loved - in the era of technological connectivity - that it was all about the physical, the spacial, the design, the cool things that make people go \u201cWOW!\u201d. I decided my transition challenge was going to be going back home (Italy) but in a different and bigger city (Milan) and see whether I could start a social enterprise called The Hub there. My friends thought I was crazy - why go back to a country you have left and which is far worse than when you left it in the first place? But this was the real challenge: changing the world had to start at home, because this is where it\u2019s hardest.</span>\n\n<span>I did it. I set up the <a href=\"http://milan.the-hub.net/public/\">Hub Milan</a> - in the midst of the worst financial crisis in years - and doing it taught me loads of lessons. There\u2019s nothing like full-on responsibility and entrepreneurial risk to make you feel like you are REALLY doing something. There's nothing like spending all the money you have put aside (or your parents gave you) to make you feel like you are really jumping off a cliff. And there's nothing like being immensely proud about something you are doing to restore faith in yourself and in the world. It was hard, it led to sleepless nights, to worrying about stuff all of the time, to becoming hyper-sensitive to every little mistake, to learning how to trust other people, but also (a first time in my life) to learning that when this trust is not deserved, one should not be afraid to be firm. And now that the Hub is done - it stands beautiful and proud in the middle of Milan, my own social enterprise - I can call myself a social entrepreneur. And what is most: I gained the respect and trust of lots of people, and even though I came back to London when my son was born (wow! now THAT\u2019S ANOTHER TRANSITION!), I still feel completely connected with hundreds of people whose paths I crossed and whose future (I hope) I contributed to reshape. </span>\n\n<span>My greatest lesson? If you are afraid, don\u2019t be. You might get hurt when you jump, but it\u2019s far more painful to live thinking \u201cwhat would have happened if I...?\u201d. This notion made me understand that the future is not a train set in a track that we board at some point. WE are the future, and if we jump we can make of it what we want.</span>\n\n", "created_at": "2011-10-17 19:31:38", "updated_at": "2017-08-31 11:52:47.069804", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1596, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 46.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6845, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 5590, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Nice take on a very specific group</b>\n\nLiked the way you combined a project talk with music and dancing, and with tech - seems like a good recipe for breaking the ice.

We spend lots of money on them on the household and institutional budgets. Several times a day we throw away these 30 cents items, often without needing to. Every human will or have used them for years. For multinational corporations they are the sweet smell of money, for us\u2026well it depends. Surely a disaster for\u00a0the environment.\u00a0\n\nWhat are we talking about?\n\nThis is the situation. You are a caring person and you see tears. What\u2019s the problem?\u00a0Parents know the drill. The usual detection algorithm starts. A check flowchart: pain? hunger? \u2026. or is it the \u2018bottom line\u2019?\n\nThe sweet or not so-sweet smell tells you what you have to do.\n\nYou will also know about the silent-positive; no alarm and no change leads\u00a0to a pain in the bottom. We dry the tears and invest in curing the wounds. Soon this leads you to adopt the institutional approach.\n\nThe institutional approach is to change at specific times, whether needed or not. The vacant slot is usually before feeding and ofthen clean ones goes to pollute our dump-yard. What goes in, must come out and then the sh.t hits the fan. The unscheduled aftermath sometimes goes undetected (silent-positive).\u00a0This scheme goes for our elderly as well. The poor person is left unchanged.\u00a0\n\nYou know what we are talking about here, don\u2019t you? DIAPERS. Those wonderful disposable ones that have released tremendous time resources, given\u00a0mothers time to breathe,\u00a0for which, we gladly pay the price.\u00a0\n\nWhat\u2019s the problem? The issues are 1. many times diapers are changed un-necessarily and 2. many times they are NOT changed at the right moment. First case is a waste of money and environmental resources. Second case is health hazard (especially for the elderly).\n\nThe theoretical solution is simple: Change when needed.\n\nIn practice: you can\u2019t go around sniffing there every 20 minutes, especially not as institutional employee.\n\nSolution:\n\nWith cheap modern technology you could easily make a \u2018pamper sniffer\u2019 (please be aware of active patents). This 10\u20ac sniffer would signal yellow (a drop of pee is absorbed so it\u2019s not yet urgent) red (the sh.t has hit the fan, change now). Those IOT freaks will upgrade to an app telling the carer: what, who, and the GPS coordinates of the sinner.\u00a0\n\nCritical obstacle:\n\nYou think Mr. Pumpers will sponsor a 50% reduction of his profit?\n\nOpportunity:\u00a0\n\nSomeone could get very rich, society will save and environment spared. Personally I would gladly have paid 100\u20ac for a 'pamper sniffer'\u00a0when my kids were small. I\u2019d happily pay 200\u20ac as a gift for my dad and please go ahead charge my children 1000\u20ac when the time comes where I\u2019m in deep \u2026.

There will be mentors (physiotherapists, engineers and designers etc.) and together we will create solutions to personal needs in form of assistive devices. A cooperative model where citizens with various skills can work together on realizing devices for use in everyday life, that will improve or maintain individual functional capabilities. This model will explore ways to transfer research results directly to users (target participants). New and existing ideas will be challenged and transformed into methods and assistive technology for activities of daily living. Initial focus will be to demonstrate how the challenges of mobility can be resolved by helping people's creativity in a social environment. One challenges that people often meet is the need for adaptation of tools to be able to perform day-to-day tasks as .abilities change, In the WeHandU laboratory people will be able (and helped) to implement such changes.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">More participants = more results</h3>\n\nThe basis of WeHandU is to be volitional participation of people with skills in various aspects of assistive technology. Solutions will vary from realizing simple mechanical aids to involvement of expert researchers. The new infrastructures of makerspaces (also known as fablabs or hackerspaces), allowing the do-it-yourself construction of objects, lend itself as a host for the WeHandU initiative. Here sophisticated devices can be prototyped using advanced machining processes (e.g. 3D printing). A lot of individuals create a personal DIY solutions. Those not marketed or provided by the health service can be manufactured in the WeHandU framework. Likewise subsequent modifications can be easily be implemented as new needs arise. People challenged by MS, stroke and SCI will find help in peers, designers, engineers networking with clinicians as well as people with \u2018soft\u2019 skills in the socializing context of a makerspace. One of the concrete challenges to resolve is addressing the problem of dropped foot . With a vast practical experience we can guide people to select, try or even construct their foot drop correcting stimulator. A device that, despite solid proof of efficiency in scientific literature, has not been adopted by the healthcare systems. Another of the most important problems regards the vanishing hand function. Here a recently developed technology comes in. It\u2019s a open source (meaning that all details of how to replicate are publically available) device for strengthening the hand, using FES (mecfes.wikispaces.com). It has been tested clinically for improving hand function in SCI, but there is no contraindications for applying it to people living with MS. Most important of all, this initiative in synergy with OpenCare will challenge the existing healthcare providers to adopt the model and provide a more user centered approach.\n\nThe WeHandU idea is mainly concerned about preserving autonomy by assistive technology for the hand function and walking using state of the art technological inventions combined with simple do-it-yourself manufacturing techniques in a socially engaging environment. Use of nowadays rapid-prototyping technologies(es. 3d printing), allows to bring creative people together for an effective low-cost collaboration process which brings real and efficient industrial solutions in relatively short time.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-08-22 17:33:12", "updated_at": "2018-05-24 10:50:32.854234", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 573, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 86.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1904, "user_id": 9, "topic_id": 1871, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Good morning everyone.\u00a0\n\nI wanted to make a quick post to pull together some of the discussion happening around promoting the unMonastery and getting the word out for the international call and the project at large - lets discuss tactics, ethos and strategy. With <strong>[#329]</strong> and <strong>[#422]</strong> now onboard for facilitating the communication of the project, now feels like a good time to pool ideas.\u00a0But firstly I wanted to highlight the great card designs <strong>[ola-m\u00f6ller]</strong> has put together.\u00a0\n\nThey're designed to be printed as low cost mini MOO cards, for offline encounters. The back and front of each design can be found here:\u00a0<a href=\"http://unmonastery.eu/pdf/MOO/\">http://unmonastery.eu/pdf/MOO/</a>\u00a0- There are 3 in total, aimed at publicising; unMonastery Matera, unMonastery Project, LOTE3. This sort of thing is good for sharing the idea with strangers you meet and makes the project a physical thing.\n\nYou can get 100 printed for\u00a0\u00a312.23 - but also visit <a href=\"http://couponfollow.com/site/moo.com\">here for coupons</a> to reduce the cost. I'm going to be ordering a 1000 for the core team over the next week. Also these files are vectors, so if you feel like printing a banner for a building, that's also an option - <strong>[andrea.paoletti]</strong> potentially we could put one for LOTE on the unMonastery building in Matera? At least create a specific design for it.\n\nBeyond offline promotion a number of approaches have been discussed.\u00a0\n\n<strong>[#45]</strong> has suggested that we reach\u00a0out to universities for those looking for a good context in which to build their thesis.\n\n<span>\"The unMonastery residency program is perfect for thesis projects. It provides a valuable context as you get to take on real challenges that someone cares about seeing solved, surrounded by interesting people from whom you can learn and you don't have to take a loan or starve your way through the thesis work. Even the length of the residency is just about right for doing the field work, developing the prototype and testing it! A perfect fit. So my suggestion is to write a call/ do a video especially for thesis students and get it out to every student at every relevant degree program at every university in Europe and beyond. We write the call in English, and ask the community members to help get the word out in their respective countries &amp; online e.g through Studentcompetitions.com.\" - See more at: /t/unmonastery/315/quick-summary-of-unmonastery-community-call-1#sthash.9mCSkAs7.dpuf</span>\u00a0\n\nIn addition to this, I felt it would make a lot of sense to silo a single residency and promote it as a competition to design and architecture schools throughout Europe, not only will it lead to an interesting project being contributed to unMonastery but will potentially fuel the imagination of reimagining space in the context of the unMonastery project.\u00a0\n\nAnother Idea floated by myself in the last community call was leveraging the mailing lists of organisations that sit within the EdgeRyders network - <strong>[#32]</strong> very helpfully put together a <a href=\"/comment/5928#comment-5928\">list of individuals</a> that may be able to help.\n\nI've also compiled a list of my own press contacts and potential channels for distribution - so I'll be meeting with people over the next few weeks to try and get some extended coverage for the project and LOTE3.\u00a0\n\nWe also need\u00a0to write a press release, I think this is one of the first tasks for myself, Fabio and Ilaria to tackle in the coming week.\u00a0\n\nIn my dreams I think about a crowdsourced book, 20 authors each writing a fictional account of life in the unMonastery and in the world on a 10 year sliding scale - that maps out the potential future of the project on a 200 hundred year trajectory. This is perhaps though is a project for post-Matera.\u00a0\n\nSo with all that said, what have I missed? What else might work?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-08-29 09:00:54", "updated_at": "2018-06-03 05:22:59.150454", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 748, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 20.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13217, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1946, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>Clone the view...</b>\n\n... don't edit the existing one, so you don't break the one I already have in the MB home page :-)\n\n", "created_at": "2013-09-16 15:39:15", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:14.834174", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 28, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [13200], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13360, "user_id": 259, "topic_id": 1248, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Loss of identity</b>\n\nHi Simone\n\nWhile sympathising with your frustration with the way EU funds are mismanaged (I saw it with my eyes in a very different context, the international development one), I also wondered what you really meant by 'loosing your identity'. I feel that a lot of your argument on loss of identity is not just felt by people who live on mountains, shared by millions of people who live in plains, hills and cities across Europe. For some, it's a simple human reaction to a world that is changing rapidly around us. Edgeryders in a way is a response to this challenge, a way to look for answers through the experiences of people like you. Identities are never really lost, they simply change with time, and this change should be managed carefully and respectfully.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://blog.thoughtpick.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Identity_Theft1-550x368.jpg\" style=\"width: 510px; height: 341px;\">\n\nFor some, however, \"loss of identity\" is just a general excuse to reject modernity, diversity, change, a nostalgic idealisation of a past that never existed, and sometimes an excuse to blame others when things are not as we would like them. For example the mountains of Europe - like in the rest of the world - were historically very poor areas, based on subsistence farming and pastoralism, with minimal economic exchanges with the outside world for obvious logistical reasons. Modern development in transportation and changes in lifestyles have brought outsiders and therefore unprecedented wealth to mountain areas until then cut off. Yet, these areas have recently been very critical of migration patterns within Europe, with unprecedented levels of suspiciuos against outsiders (even when from the same country) and with an infamous case of <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3690668.stm\">a country refusing a </a><font size=\"2\"><a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3690668.stm\">proposal to grant automatic citizenship to the grandchildren of immigrants</a>. </font>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://media.salon.com/2009/11/swiss_islamophobia_betrays_enlightenment_ideals-460x307.jpg\" style=\"width: 460px; height: 307px;\">\n\nWhat I am trying to say is this: what I hear from your story is a wonderful personal experience of someone who has found a place that is right for him in this wonderful land, but I struggle to understand what the underlying lesson for many others is... I would be really grateful if you could tell us - even in Italian if it's easier, and we'll translate.\n\nThanks!\n\nAlberto\n\n", "created_at": "2011-12-05 18:15:47", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:15.572642", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 441, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25235, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 2496, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>Hey you, how's it going?</b>\n\nWondering what your feeling is about the responses you have been getting (if any), or from chats with people you know.

I have an chronic asthma since when I was 2 due to a medical poisoning. My parents were there to make me extract some of it out of throat. Few days since those\u00a0moments, when weather will have changing,\u00a0I'm cough early 12 hours before its changing, a kind of meteorological detector :-D More than that, there were 9 people\u00a0leaving in a small house of 10m2.\u00a0Majority of Malagasy people we use charcoal as combustion for cooking like us. So it was more and less enough ventilated for all of us. During my childhood I was suffering of heavy breathing and lungs whistling, the fact that I lived next to a forest having\u00a0fresh air and help me to overcome this asthma until my adult life. I didn't know too much people who suffer with the same illness like mine until now...\n\nMore than the half of the forest in my country has been cutted for combustion, furnitures, slash and burn,... Following population growth from 15 million to 20 during the last 30 years. Public health and sanitation are trying as they can and have to keep us healthy; with this growing population; open fire and carbonic gas are growing following this,\u00a0carbonic gas from factories and cars... Nowadays, 80% of kids under 5 years\u00a0seem\u00a0asthmatic. I know that when I was asking the pediatrician in a pediatric hospital, where I brought my 3 years old nephew for lungs exam. For information, only few people who have enough money can afford treatment like aerosol \"inhale\", medicines,...\u00a0\n\nRich and powerful people control the destiny and future of my country.\n\nFollowing this the Malagasy government has decided to stop using plastic bags last December without alternative until now. This is a good idea but the bad effect is some of our \"ravinala\" considered queen and symbolic tree of Madagascar is taking place of the plastic bags ; I heard a rumor that some people on our government brought back \"biodegradable \" plastic bag made with cassava, It's a kind of bag thick than one before. Without label or information about the factory whose made it, probably from one powerful people on the government.\u00a0\n\nOther than that, without mentioning the massive destruction of large area of primary forest caused by a multinational firm mine project since 2003.\n\nActually it's our future generations lives is on the line metaphorically and literally. Nature and man can't be separated.\n\nAs my thoughts, training for peasants for new method of rice planting unsteady of slash and burn. Biogas can replace the charcoal and wood used as \u00a0combustion of 80% of Malagasy people. \u00a0Education for all and ordinance and penalties can be applied for any means of illegal way. \u00a0It's just a small sand into the gears to overcome or slow\u00a0down this fast truck.\n\nMichel RAKOTOARISOA\n\n", "created_at": "2016-07-13 17:34:32", "updated_at": "2018-05-24 16:09:47.336688", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 522, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 15.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31143, "user_id": 2429, "topic_id": 3943, "post_number": 20, "raw": "<b>Thank you all</b>\n\nI will install the Drupal and the components I need in my virtual machine this weekend and give it a try, with the software installed I will get a better perspective of what and how to do it\n\n", "created_at": "2014-12-04 12:57:49", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:51.366786", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 45, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [31137], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29787, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3367, "post_number": 13, "raw": "Yes, do focus on the long form, please.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-07-24 20:30:33", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:43.942542", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 11, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [29730], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8782, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1243, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Voil\u00e0 en fran\u00e7ais!</b>\n\nMichel, felicitations!

I'm trying to re-organize the several proofs of concept which we put in place with @dora, to have a unified simple tool that we might use to query wikipedia and store responses to a database, for later visualization.\n\nBased on what we managed to fetch via the API, here's what I was thinking:\n\n* we have a list of the medicine pages\n\n* for each page, we can query the pageviews, the links to other wikipedia pages and the translations into other languages\n\n* for each link to other wikipedia pages, we can tell whether they're medicine pages or not; if they are, we can record they're semantically connected\n\n* for each page translation we can repeat the above queries and store the relative data\n\nWith the stored info we could try to analyze:\n\n* which pages are connected, assuming their sub-network might represent a certain topic\n\n* which pages (in absolute and relatively to a certain sub-network) have most views\n\n* for each topic or sub-network, what is the weight of a specific language in the overall page count\n\nThings we might learn:\n\n* higher page counts of certain topics might represent higher interest and/or practice of autodiagnosis for such topics (I'm aware that what's actually relevant is how to tell between the two but we can investigate this further)\n\n* existance of page translations in certain languages might imply a geographical and/or ethnographical relevance for certain areas and/or ethnies\n\n* higher page counts for a certain topic, in a certain language, might be relevant too\n\nThinking of Edgesense and ways to use it (maybe) differently than what it was designed for, we might have nodes representing pages as \"semantic knots\" (more than \"bits of conversation\") and connections representing their semantic affinity. Edgesense could then be used to analyze whether the sub-regions it finds match the ones we found as wikipedia's internal links (mentioned above).\n\nWe could also visualize page counts for each sub-region and each node, both as a global count (including all languages) ans as a \"filtered\" count, per ethnographic group.\n\nFinally, if we imagine this visualized in three dimensions, we might have:\n\n* a planar XY mapping, with all the English medicine pages, where all connections are visualized and semantic sub-regions are highlighted (the distributions of nodes in 2D space wouldn't necessarily have a geographical meaning)\n\n* a Z layering, where at each depth/height we have a \"language plane\" which shows which of the English pages are translated in a certain language\n\nConnections would exists across layers, giving a \"volumetric\" representation of medicine semantic networks.\n\nI guess this last bit might sound particularly abstract or confusing, until I manage to sketch a graphic prototype. I hope I'll be able to do it soon, on paper at least, to try explain the idea a bit better.\n\nIf anything of what I wrote makes sense to any of you, let me know :)\n\n", "created_at": "2016-02-20 14:45:30", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:57.167398", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 564, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 10.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [32201], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6792, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 6271, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Creating the conditions for opencare: in for the long haul</b>\n\nHi @gehan it is a pleasure to meet you, welcome!\n\nI've heard great things about the work in Glasgow from Nadia, and would be interested in zooming in this overarching care theme during our festival later in the year. The reason for me personally is obvious: being a community manager here at edgeryders, the core of my work goes into creating the conditions for care, in a community and organisation: whether it's trying to forge new relationships and learning, creating\u00a0meaningful work for those of us not willing to\u00a0compromise\u00a0to an exploitative\u00a0job market but needing to find resilience in precarity, or just being on the margins somehow socioeconomically but also health wise, or culturally.\u00a0I realise more and more how ambitious this is and how we need to be in it for decades to understand how it can shift things broadly, culturally or in policy, like you say - doing things differently, rewiring ourselves etc.\n\nSome projects and wonderful people I know which you might want to consider connecting with, mainly because they\u00a0go deep into rewiring communities:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><a href=\"/t/woodbine-health-autonomy-center/488\">Woodbine Health Autonomy Center</a> in nyc (meet @Woodbinehealth !) collective and info/educational\u00a0center asserting the need to\u00a0regain\u00a0control over our health, move away\u00a0from institutionalized healthcare which addresses only localised, symptomatic problems in the paradigm of the\u00a0individualist modern society. They are pretty up front: <em>\"We do not reject modern methods of medicine, but rather recognize the need to detach the knowledge from the oppressive institutions that guard it.\"\u00a0</em></li>\n\n<li><a href=\"/t/access-space-a-new-model-for-individual-and-community-development/1677\">Access Space</a> in Sheffield, and more so @James who was part of the early group and now moved on to doing something else.

Again, what stayed with me over the years is this very uncompromising view:\u00a0<em>\"We realise now that the most valuable technology that is being discarded by our society is PEOPLE.

Vow of..., Uniform, 200 Year Plan,\n\nPrivacy and Contemplation\" \n\nI agree fundamentally that it's important to be clear what has and has not been tested, as you'll see on the wiki template I forwarded the other day, each section has a place to express this explicitly, with contact details. However on the subject of 'fantasy' I have some disagreement, unMonastery existed entirely as an idea that we fantasied about for a year, it was through the construction of a narrative that it was bought into existence - narrative is a much more effective tool for development than rigid documentation because it allows the vision to expand and in many ways is what draws a lot of people to the project.\n\nA fine example of this in respect to one of the cards is the 200 Year History session which we ran at LOTE3, which was by far the best, most attended and engaging session - it allowed many to go beyond the bricks and mortar needed to develop the project, bringing to the surface what it is about the unMonastery that draws people in. It also allows for a space where ideas can be more generative and enable those participating to embed themselves in the project based on their wishes and hopes for the future. It's also important to consider that although some ideas weren't tested prior to opening in Matera a lot of conceptual work went into them, like the uniform idea, I don't believe the unMonastery in-a-box should be restricted entirely to the 6 months in Matera but rather span the 2 years we've been working on the project.\n\nRE: Trello, if there was more time I'd like to take this approach but right now we have 2 weeks left to make a decent stab and compiling everything we know.\n\nIn respect to the division and balancing, we devised a similar schema based on; Internal, External, Narrative and Phyical/Logistic and within this reduced and balanced out the cards. As has been highlighted in this thread, there is a slightly philosophical question about what grows an unMonastery and whether we do ourselves a disservice in attempting to create a balanced model for replication - since we haven't defined whether it's the framework dictated by physical space and projects that enables the growth of the unMonastery or the development of the individual as part of a shared consciousness within a group.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-07-16 11:26:50", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:50.441288", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 504, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [30854], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22946, "user_id": 781, "topic_id": 1421, "post_number": 13, "raw": "<b>:)</b>\n\nI agree !", "created_at": "2012-04-18 15:07:14", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:07.448587", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 10.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 484, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 451, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2016-01-16 23:33:57", "updated_at": "2017-07-12 18:19:42.615135", "deleted_at": "2017-07-25 14:03:27.188072", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5899, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 5866, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Do you remember <a href=\"/c/finished-challenges/makerfox\">Makerfox</a>? The moneyless marketplace that we invented, and that let a group of Edgeryders volunteer worktime in exchange for a 800 USD ticket for LOTE3?\n\nWell, the project was never dead, it just evolved. My brother has been working tirelessly on it, while I have assisted with ideas and concept finding. So there was Makerfox, then it evolved into something called Task Exchange, and now finally into <a href=\"https://pay.coupons/\">PayCoupons</a>. It's public, you are welcome to use it. I'll be available in the comments section for answering all questions about functionality and uses.\n\nBut in short, this is what I imagine that PayCoupons can become for the Edgeryders community: a tool that lets us realize many more of the ideas and projects we have in mind. Because it allows a very flexible collaboration: a bit like crowdfunding on steroids. Just like crowdfunding it allows P2P support, it allows everyone of us to pitch in with small amounts of resources and even when they don't have the time or skills to volunteer directly. But unlike crowdfunding, it does not rely on money but on \"coupons\" (rights to a specific person's products and services). While money is scarce, coupons are abundant since everyone can create their own coupons \"out of thin air\". Feels like being your own central bank :-) Actually I'm really excited about this tool: I think it's finally one that can realistically break the power of \"always scarce\" money, which so far has been our only main tool for economic collaboration. (And sorry that I have to break it to you, but Bitcoin is also of this \"always scarce money\" type.)\n\nFor more details, I have written <a href=\"https://pay.coupons/blog/articles/five-use-cases\">this blog post today</a> that explains five use cases in more detail: trading DIY products and favours, donations, collecting funding and investments.\n\nFor those interested in the technology: yes, it's still our original network barter invention that is powering this new iteration. Since coupons are \"fluid\" (able to be split into arbitrarily small parts), network barter performs exceptionally well here, unlike in the Makerforx platform where we also had products and product-like packaged services that could not be partitioned. Now, with 20 people and 4 orders per person, a simulated network barter event will fulfill 70% of all open orders. (\"Order\" means here somebody entering a higher target balance for a specific type of coupons in their PayCoupons wallet.)\n\nAnyway. For now, you may register, look around and explore the PayCoupons platform, and post your open questions here. I'll share instructions (and a real-world example) for how to use PayCoupons to make your own project happen in the next few days.

If we want to be abble to work together inside our value system, we need to understand how we work. If fruitful collaboration means working togheter while feeling good towards each other in a mutual environment of respect, these two thought bubbles could be for you.</strong>\n\nThis article is a more personal post that came to mind after evaluating my own participation in two projects and how horizontal organizations can play mind tricks to your own involvement.\n\nModern organizations, starting as a local and small group of people tend to go fast in an horizontal or flat organization structure. People are seen as equal and every role is important, it helps to feel involved, and makes the range of possibilities bigger. But without a leader the group misses sometimes direction and efficiency is less visible. Roles are then distributed and somebody becomes head of design, head of funds or head of communication. Productivity is flowing again, but for me a subtler barrier is still in the way. From idea to task you still need preparation, and that is something I\u2019m completely lacking of.\n\nYou could argument that everybody needs to do his part of preparation, and you can\u2019t only be the philosopher, but I lean to see a collective as an ecosystem where each other strengths are put up front and we organize ourselves around this.\n\nOften I tend to fill the gaps as soon as I see them. If something practical isn\u2019t been taken care of I jump to do it, because I\u2019m good at last minute problem solving, but with my lack of preparation skills, if it is to much in amount it take all my energy and i\u2019m doomed to fail, followed by personal and collective frustration.\n\n<strong>The Thinkers, the Preppers and the Doers</strong>\n\nSo instead of blocking on my personal incompetence, I try to solve it by what I like doing: systemical thinking. I categorize all work inside an organization in three categories that flow in each other: Thinking, preparing and doing.\n\nVisualize your own strengths and weaknesses as a finite set of skill points like in a video game. In your short or long-lived life you earned skill points through events and big moments. You gathered your knowledge into one of those categories and how more you collect how more you can handle in that category, but other way around: tackling tasks inside a category you aren\u2019t good is time and energy consuming with an inefficient consequence as a a result.\n\nUnless you are a superhuman that can do everything alone, in an organization it is rather intelligent to search for each other complementary skills. A thinker with a lot of energy to give to do will need a preparation master as his right hand. How bigger the group how more difficult it is to find a balance, but have five thinkers and one prepper you will never get the job done.\n\nThe big difference with a vertical organization is that in a flat organization those three categories aren\u2019t intended. Where you have specific roles inside a hierarchical organization build around power the thinker will always be above the prepper that will be above the doer. When you see everybody as equal we try to divide also the categories equal, but there is the catch: not a lot of people have throughout their lifetime chosen to equally distribute their skill points.\n\nWhat we need is better understanding about this kind of dynamic. Knowing this I\u2019m intended to take lesser practical mid-long tasks and preparative tasks on me cause I never trained myself and communicate it with my teammates to see how we can find a better dynamic inside the collective. On the other side, give me a task, well explained that takes a certain amount of time, even repetitive, I\u2019m your guy.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-10-07 11:04:24", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 14:10:33.034484", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 727, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3366, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 3333, "post_number": 1, "raw": "coffee\n\nDate: 2014-10-25 08:00:00 - 2014-10-25 08:30:00, Europe/Brussels Time.", "created_at": "2014-07-15 16:47:56", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:18.476512", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 19, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10288, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 2200, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Community survey:tool to see what other community members think?</b>\n\nHi Dante,\n\nI think it's up to you to make a case for ER being ideological or not, I am not so interested in refuting that (although i don't think a lot of people here claim to know how the society should be organized!).

If they are rhetorical, simply ignore the below ;)\n\nYou ask:<em> Is there anything like \"Edgeryders\", or is Edgeryders just a forum ? </em>\n\nWho should answer that? I don't know. For me it's a community and I build narratives around it, and the results show me that it's in fact a community (good, healthy relationships and collaboration around common goals being key). This doesn't impede you from relating to is as with any other forum.  \n\n<strong>Example of narrative: </strong>\"A community of like minded people experimenting with radical solutions to environmental, social, economic, political crises. ER the social enterprise was founded to keep the community going &amp; growing and collaborating, and support community members in their endeavors\" \n\n<strong>Example of work that proves it: </strong>Organising &amp; pulling off a great LOTE3 with no money and all of us volunteering, except 2 Dutch ppl who got funded because of the social enterprise which was fundraising with minimum resources.\n\nYou<span> keep refering to an indistinct \"we\" and an indistinct third person. </span>\n\n<span><em>\"what are the ideologies being pursued?\"</em> , </span><em><span>\"how can we defend ourselves\" </span></em>\n\n<em style=\"line-height: 1.7;\">If different groups interacting on the Edgeryders forum have opposing ideologies, strategies, goals, </em><em style=\"line-height: 1.7;\">and if one group or set of individuals uses a panel of individuals and projects to promote projects with opposing ideologies, how can we defend ourselves from such political recuperation ? </em>\n\n<span>--&gt; </span><span>so far when there was opposition to something it was solved through arguments (see Eimhin opposing funding from Rockefeller-&gt; more than 1 person wanted to apply for that, so it just happened</span><span>: https://edgeryders.eu/comment/5832#comment-5832</span>\n\n<em>I remember one of the initial approaches of Edgeryders was to study the youth, and their dynamics:\n\nI also see the potential of a public relations / tokenism ( taking a minority ? ) approach by certain institutions, as to show they are actively adressing certain issues. All this may have contributed to the financing of a small group of organizers. </em>\n\n-&gt; the number of words like \"potential\", \"certain\", \"may have\" is making me miss your point entirely, I'm sorry.\n\n<em>what are some of the organizers turning to, to get funding ? How are the people who converge and interact through Edgeryders being used ? Are we becoming the product that is being sold ? By whom ? And for what interests ?</em>\n\n--&gt; who's we? well it turns out many of us - enterprise founders, members, users etc are chasing funding because we think we can make a living out of being part of Edgeryders community and <strong>collaborating.</strong> And that's become clear with the<a href=\"/t/making-lote3/360/hire-yourself-documentation\"> Hire Yourself</a> session at Lote.

I guess I am more like </span><a href=\"/u/marc\" style=\"line-height: 1.7;\">@Marc</a><span>: I am driven primarily by building useful, clever, beautiful things.

If you look at the Edgeryders board of directors (with the obvious exception of the strong pre-existing tie between Nadia and myself) you will see five people that have very little in common, don't hang out together (we must have spent less than ten hours overall in the same room \u2013 and that's one year after starting a company together!) and don't expect to. We bond over common goals and respect for each other's abilities; our social contract is built upon delivering, or \u2013 failing that \u2013 trying to, very seriously.</span>\n\nYou guys went for a different way. And well you did, because it's your way, and hey \u2013 I am not particularly successful with this stuff to begin with, so it's not like my way of doing things is so great. But once you go your way, you've got to play ball. We\u00a0<em>expected</em>\u00a0tensions and glitches, remember? Your application form had a question \"Are you prepared to be challenged, physically and emotionally?\". That was no joke. We knew from the onset that monasticism 2.0 would certainly need more than one iteration, and could well fail altogether. This does not mean there is any blame to around: you, me, Ben, everybody means well. The failure is in the wiring, not in the people. \"It'not you, it's the social dynamics\": if we don't see this, we have been studying network science for nothing.\n\nFaced with relational difficulties, my instinct is to disinvest emotionally: we don't have to like each other to work together, we just need to\u00a0<em>respect</em>\u00a0each other, and respect needs to be encoded in concrete indicators \u2013 like we show up on time, we take good care of each other's work, we don't waste each other's time. This is often easier to do than to be socially cohesive with someone if the chemistry is not there. Then, in my experience (and in Simmelian sociology), this sort of arms length, constructive, respectful interaction builds trust over time, so that people can at least relax, and in some cases even move towards being friends. But that's just me, and once again I am no expert. I am only telling you this because if I were in the building that's what I would do: remind myself and others that we are experimenting; that it is ok to fail; and that, above all, failure can be... incremental. If people fight for lack of privacy, it's probably simpler to bring in partitions and try to spread people across more rooms than to try to enforce communal living \"just\" because that was the original idea. This is what I would do, and if you like the approach you can deploy it yourself. What would you expect from me moving in with you \u2013 other than the obvious tensions with me, like Ksenia, not being a sanctioned unMonasterian?\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-14 10:49:58", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:29.985210", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 664, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [26425], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2641, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 2608, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/3f0d7c674910f73637161554ab36e1b84c90a3aa.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"255\"><br>\n\n<span><span><strong>A new world is being built by people working far outside the mainstream</strong>.

We agreed to openly ask the community to step forward to become fellows. We make it clear that the fellows will be appointed top-down by ScImpulse (they are hired staff, but used for the same purpose for which we had envisioned fellowships in the proposal: field work/assessment work of bottom-up care initiatives). This allows us to be fair and nonextractive to the community, and is likely to boost engagement significantly.

They were promised a better and healthier nation like the one we are being promised, and the recent news reports on the media show how miserably the country has failed to meet the commitment. Even after expending of millions and hundreds of emergency teams being deployed, the cholera outbreak that had begun after 10 months of the quake is yet to be eradicated and has claimed about 9000 lives. Due to poor planning and even poorer execution, thousands of Haitians still live without a roof over their heads, unemployment still haunts the population, development goals are achieved only in papers and reports.\n\n<em>Looking back and forth\u2026</em>\n\nEverywhere was complete chaos, in a matter of seconds you could see your world falling apart. After the initial trauma and fear settled down, something miraculous happened. People finally became people not confined by the barricades of class, caste or religion.\n\nPeople have the propensity to change at the precipice and this was a walking testimony. Suddenly, the world Lennon had imagined was right in front of us to witness, we were all one under God.\u00a0 There weren\u2019t any Brahmins, Dalits, Chettris, Kamis, Damais, supreme or subdued. We became brothers and sisters, all dining in a single kitchen under tarps, in a society that didn\u2019t know any prejudice and our names didn\u2019t hold any weight as long as we were looking out for each other.\n\n<strong>Are we okay?</strong>\n\nWe need to remember a simple fact that we cannot save the fatalities, but we can honor their memory by committing ourselves to saving what has survived. The incognito wound, the struggling state of mind goes beyond simple observation and calculations. Now more than ever, we need to keep our calm and composure and not throw in the towel.\n\nSo, the rubbles are cleared but the troubles aren\u2019t\u2026\n\nThe data and statistics cannot pinpoint the mental scarring. Immediate actions must be taken in order to help people with PTSD. Medical stations must be set up in the crisis hit areas where positive thinking is permeated, sanguine images are imprinted in their mind, sharing is encouraged and medications are provided if necessary.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<em>Time for a change\u2026</em>\n\nThe catastrophe surely has been an eye opener for all of us, a testament to how reckless we have been, paying no attention to the early warnings and living in establishments that put our lives at stake. There were houses built only by piling up stone, mud and thatched, tin roofs which never stood a chance against the disaster of that scale.\n\nWe stand at a crucial point at the moment where opting to look back can cost us dearly. The solidarity people showed, volunteers flooding from every corner to lend a hand in the rescue and recovery operation brought incredible changes in the lives of many but a fortnight of working in unison is barely sufficient to achieve a long term effect. It was the time of crisis and everyone did what was needed to be done. The job is not finished yet. People\u2019s contribution needs to continue for a much longer period and there are several ways to ensure that it does.\n\nInstead of looking at this disaster as something that took away everything, consider it as an opportunity. In order to increase people\u2019s participation in this arduous task of rebuilding our nation, this task must be looked at as a chance to create employment opportunities.\n\nUnemployment has always been a pressing issue in the country forcing many to exit country each day to pursue their monetary dreams so they can secure their latter days. The government and other agencies must seek to launch skill development and training programs to generate a huge magnitude of able and adept manpower. If in the years to come we are to \u2018build back our nation better\u2019, this could be a major step towards it.\n\n<em>Bouncing back\u2026</em>\n\nTourism and agriculture bore the brunt of the catastrophe as the entire economy took a nosedive.\n\nHeritage sites have suffered colossal damage, hundreds of temples, monuments, sculptures have either been completely demolished and many still require repair and adept reworking. The mass media\u2019s coverage of the devastation and the ruins also contributes to the enormous drop in the number of tourists. The restrictions to visit Nepal have been lifted but the increase in new arrivals will certainly require things to settle down first.\n\nThe media needs to assist in emanating information regarding the safety status of favorite destinations and encourage foreigners to enter the country after proper inspection and evaluation.\n\nAs if the loss of huge number of cattle, livestock and agricultural tools wasn\u2019t causing enough inconvenience, the farmers have found themselves in bigger dilemmas after the recurring landslides and erosion washed away the arable soil, spoiled their crops. Moreover, the arrival of monsoon has resulted in further landslides putting many lives at risk and added additional threat to the land, crops and the roads.\n\nExpert monitoring of the cracks and ruptures in the earth must be conducted to help with the reconstruction of the roadways by properly stabilizing the sloppy areas, fixing the highly unsettled soil, evening out the gaps. There are plenty of other options like planting trees such as Pine, Oak that extends deep below the ground and installing of gravel in the rifts.\n\nRuling out politics has become a common practice among the youths developed out of years of falling prey to their beautifully crafted deceptive presentations. People have long lost their faith in politics. The new constitution however is a great opportunity to let our voices make the difference. Some proportion of the driving seat needs to be chartered for the youth representatives, the ones that can well understand the true picture of the young natives and vouch for them, generate opportunities for the active populace.\n\nThe government of Nepal and many other organizations are receiving large amount of funds from foreign nations including USA, Australia, Japan, India, China, England, etc.\n\nTransparency as to where all the funds are allocated, how the means are transported, mobilized and follow up observation and investigation on the results achieved and target that were previously set is a must. Experts must be deployed in respective fields to prepare reports on the efficacy of the programs after having conducted thorough study so that adjustment and changes can be made to meet the requirements and more productive plans can be created so it ensures uniform allocation of the fund in the rescue recovery missions, food services and medical facilities as well as the development of infrastructures.\n\nA body of unbiased professionals must be formulated in each of the organizations working for humanitarian relief to scrutinize the flow of the money and a detailed statement and report must be publicly displayed at regular intervals.\n\nThe topography of our nation makes it more difficult to move things around, mobilize the resources equivalently. We\u2019re looking at a major recuperation here and it is bound to take more than just a few months of running around dispersing relief materials and building emergency shelters. All the spadework must be done beforehand. Bigger plans to build bigger, long term infrastructures must be prepared and executed in due time with diligence.\n\nWith the advent of monsoon, the risky mountain slopes have become further menacing and is likely to put more lives at peril and make the journey of redemption further strenuous. Significant numbers of victims continue to live under tarpaulins and in flimsy arrangements prone to being washed away by the heavy monsoon. It is of utmost importance that the reconstruction projects be brought to the fore emphasizing upon the establishment of firm and taut abodes.\n\nMeanwhile, some are living in unsanitary camps, make-do facilities that are not in keeping with health requirements. Water insecurity and food insecurity are very pressing problems. This may lead to outbreak of diseases like cholera, dysentery, diarrhea which is the last thing we require in the present circumstances.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<em>Spread the word, brag or boast</em>\n\nIt might look like your patting yourself on the back though in actuality, you are helping. Now, it must come to you as no wonder when I tell you that most of the people do not like you posting pictures where you\u2019re clearing the debris out of a decrepit house with a bunch of people, donning a volunteer\u2019s shirt that says \u201cwe will fight back\u201d but while they try to shrug it off, it does the magic, yes the magic of double negative if I may say so.\n\nSo turns out, You , the docile fragment of the populace sitting with their digital acquaintances at seconds length, scrolling through pages of \u2018news\u2019 and endlessly fishing for compliments can come to some avail after all. So, do not forget to share, post, tweet away if you\u2019re contributing something. Just ignore the judgmental eyes. Then again, what else can they do? Comment you to death? Poke you to unconsciousness? Unfriend you for life, unfollow? Hashtag you to hell?\n\nIf only the people were half has concerned about the ones that are still living under settlements that were built to sustain for weeks as they are about Pluto and the name of the mountains there. We concern ourselves with things that do not matter. Our brave ancestors and rich history would be looking at us and saying,\u201d Well, we didn\u2019t fight for that, certainly not for those who spent their good years trying to verify our birthplace but never accomplished a feat that would prove them to be our offspring\u201d\n\nOne thing we should avoid is sharing information hastily without validating where they come from just because they\u2019re some sponsored, popular page with devotees in numbers. Social media authorities must make sure that information circulated are accurate and verified unlike the \u2018bigger earthquake rumors\u2019, fake BBC web pages, \u201815 days of doom\u2019, etc. We have to be careful not to become messengers of unwarranted news that spread over the internet like fire.\n\n<em>Work/pray for Nepal</em>\n\nThe dissension between these two actions \u2018work\u2019 and \u2018pray\u2019 took the whole debate to another level during the very first months of fighting back. \u201cStop praying and Work for Nepal.\u201d Do you mean for us to stop lighting candles, sending out prayers or hoping things to get better. Does it mean that the gleam of diyas perturbs their peace and the incenses we set alight incenses the lord?\n\nGiving up faith would mean surrendering to despair and not many return from that state. Nepal\u2019s a country where there\u2019s temple every few blocks away, shrines, mosque, monasteries, gumbas and families and houses built on faith and religion. To abandon faith would result in a worst case scenario when our insides are ready to concede. Work for Nepal but don\u2019t offer profanities when someone prays or appeals to the heavens.\n\nNepal is in a vulnerable state and it is heartwarming to see many foreign nations come forth to help Nepal dig itself out of this pit. The recovery process can be slow but the sustainability must not be compromised. We must pursue with the same resilience we\u2019re known to display and have faith in ourselves to build a bigger and better Nepal. Consider this as a precursor to a new dawn. Now is the perfect opportunity to carry our nation to a beautiful sunrise where there\u2019ll be only one heaven, the one where we live\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/0/0504602535a82c376336a0f98ece68f39ae3fe4f.jpg\" width=\"689\" height=\"390\"><br>\n\nLittle children back at home who helped us build temporary shelter.\u00a0\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/e/efcf2c3894ffd0ae39fca795ffdcbc42db7b9f5f.jpg\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\nButterlamps, keeping the faith alive.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/8/88a8cc4e28821eec5dbbf9d5daf2af70980e780a.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"477\"><br>\n\nAncient storytelling, along with sermons.

On the one hand I love brevity - it is very important for many in your potential audience. So a short and self-contained document is good from that point of view. It is not easy to write something meaningful and short but I think this was fine.\n\nOn the other hand I very often feel like the most interesting parts almost inevitably get lost. Particularly the pre-startup situation is important I think. As someone said in a call: It is not what you are doing at B, but how you got from A to B. Or why you started heading for B and not C. You did address this, but I think there are always many factors that play into this, which you have to balance. In hindsight we tend to simplify these things - but if we had talked to you one week before and important decision you would probably have all kinds of arguments for and against. Another thing I would like to see more often is how the environment was thinking about the endeavor, then and now. Were the parents supportive? To what degree? How about the friends and other family - did any get on board, or was/is there envy? Is the circle of friends today similar to what it was then? Were there any mentors (academic? business? law side?) - and how did the relationship to them begin and develop over time? Which of these factors would definitely be a show-stopper and which one only maybe? Which factors seem least significant. Is this the same for other participants? Are they involved to a similar degree or are you the lead?\n\nOf course if you follow that direction - there is no chance to make a <em>short</em> interview. So that is a considerable downside. Can someone think of a solution? Perhaps split it into a \"summary part\" and a \"rambling part\"? Put the latter (linked to) in the appendix of the book? I am not at all sure what would be best.\n\nRe differences\n\nYou wrote:<em>\u00a0Collaboration and Mutual Support? \"Not in the business. We're in a 100 % \u00a0capitalist system with a lot of competition and I can't think about mutual support, except for just a few cases.\"</em>\n\nCompare this with the article on silicon valley:\n\nhttps://medium.com/observations-and-thoughts/the-secret-sauce-of-silicon-valley-d152f6dc2dcf\n\nI am not trying to criticize! But it is important that at least their perception of themselves is quite different. But also note that customers did pay upfront, and generously. This may have more to do with how flush you are with money (locally), than what kind of economic system you run in. And as a secondary effect - the diversity of ideas. If everyone is pretty much doing the same thing, you are in direct competition. If every other project pursues a significantly different thing, there is a good chance that they'll create a market for you or you have synergies at some point. However this means you need to be flush enough with money to be doing rather wild moonshots, otherwise you fall back into competing for the fastest ROI in the same market segment as everybody else. At least that is (some of) my take.\n\nAlso if you have the time, I strongly recommend reading the <a href=\"https://medium.com/backchannel/why-silicon-valley-will-continue-to-rule-c0cbb441e22f\">To Invent the Future, You Must Understand the Past</a> article that is linked in the above one as well.\u00a0\n\nI think both articles hit their respective nails smack on the head. However they don't really apply very much outside of silicon valley, for the reason they explain well.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-08 08:19:50", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:58.077042", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 650, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 1.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2201], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4016, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 3983, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<em>Notes transferred from the <a href=\"https://lote4.hackpad.com/Case-Study-Adventures-keynote-session-V5IGwcWwrzJ\">Lote4 hackpad</a>. Anything you took from the session and would like to share with the community? Do add it below in a comment. </em>\n\nDuring the summer, brave people at Edgeryders like @lauren, @hazem, @anon, @mariabyck, and others have collected many case studies of people and communities trying to steward assets for the common good. In this session,they reported on what they found and the people they met.\n\n<strong>Lauren Lapidge:</strong> I moved across Europe (mostly Southern: Italy, Turkey, Greece, the latter turning out to be the best) looking for people and groups doing stewardship projects. I tried to go through social networks of people we knew, but that did not go too well (except in Athens, where Jeff Andreoni's network worked really well). However, I did talk to many people on the street and that way met unexpected stewards, like Constantinou (?), an Athens pensioner who noticed people were struggling finding even money for food. So he started spending all his pension on cooking equipment and ingredients, which he puts in his car and drives to the worst crisis-stricken neighbourhoods to do a sort of instant soup kitchen. It is only supported by donations. He has amazing social skills too, and enjoys a lot of respect. Athens was the most successful.  \n\nA lesson learned for the travel case study: it should take more time in each city and better coordinate in advance; also, Lauren feels it was difficult to navigate new spaces where she didn't speak the language. \n\nRelevance for stewardship: Costantino a good steward because he saw a problem in the community (eg dumpster diving) and felt he needed to help - ended up spending his pension to feed people. he saw a problem in the community tried to solve it. The stewarding component is visible in that he provides for people, creating a sense of community. is that human or stewarding? what is stewardship? it is not about defining stewardship.\n\nWhat are the take away points in Lauren's trip? Found out that there are only a few stewards but they are involved in many many projects. eg Jay Cousins. Ice Hubs: started as a fab lab but they decided it wasn't the best way to spend the money, so decided to get the community involved in skill exchange; inter generational exchange (pensioneer hacker spaces). \n\nStewards should be interchangeable, and documentation is a key part of that  stewards that can move between different areas in working domain, like someone who can talk to government and talk to a small community projects, can speak the 2 different languages. \n\n<strong>Ben Vickers</strong>\n\nMentions an interesting project that sells votes on the web (\"bring capitalism and democracy together\") <a href=\"http://www.vote-auction.net/\">http://www.vote-auction.net/</a> I hosted a couple of meetups around stewardship in London and Stockholm. What emerged is that stewardship is not necessarily resilience. Allotments are seen as a way to discover the values of stewardship. Some people say that stewardship is not a discrete activity, but an overarching philosophy around everything they do. Some people say that they don't necessarily steward one thing, but rather lend a hand to maintaining ecologies. \n\nJordan Lane in Sweden understands well system thinking and applies it to small-scale scenario. He is an urban planner working for the public service in Stockholm. He describes himself as a \"urban shepherd\" (see: <a href=\"/t/the-urban-shepherd-of-stockholm/3581\">https://edgeryders.eu/en/the-urban-shepherd-of-stockholm</a>). This is quite literal: you can use sheep as zoning devices, moving them across the city for various purposes. For example, you can move your sheep to the city center when children go to school, so they slow down traffic and children learn about animal.\n\nThe chicken story was very meticulously planned to get people to interact with each other and depend more on each other. For example, hatch the chicken in somebody's bathtub, so that person has to shower in a neighbour's bathroom, and that creates a tie. He seems to work in an oblique way: not just go out, buy the chicken and build the hatch, but go by a much slower route, distributing the ownership of the process (and therefore stewardship itself) across different people. \n\n<strong>Kei Kreutler </strong>\n\nOpenTech School using agile learning instead of having a teacher in front. Started in Berlin and now has five locations across the world, we know it from the unMonastery. They came up with a hackership program. Pedagogically, they have a \"no keyboard rule\": the teacher can't touch the student's keyboard. All workshops are free and open to everyone, no matter their skills. Also have HackerShip program, a 3 month residency to work on people's projects - with mentors and volunteers. The funding model is this: when people graduate from the hackership program they pledge to give 10% of their salary to the program for one year.\n\n<strong>Jeff Andreoni</strong>\n\nThe Peliti project in Greece (learn more: https://edgeryders.eu/en/lote4-stewardship-case-studies/peliti-seed-bank) stewards legacy seeds from all over the world. Many species are uniquely available in Greece, and that is how they became aware of the issue, but now they are stewarding indigenous species from anywhere in the world. They will give seeds to whoever wants them, so that anybody can become a steward of even just one or two species.\n\n<strong>Maria Byck</strong> enjoyed the process of meeting different people, a lot of people have different perception thoughts about stewardship. Discovered it was interesting for people to think of them as stewards. In UK: system of allotment - lands owned by the state and people can pay small amounts for small parts of the land. In smaller towns - populations losing their lands in the coal mining during the 80s. People began stewarding gardening practices.\n\n<a href=\"/t/interview-with-paul-baines-great-lakes-commons-map/3727\">Stewarding the Great Lake Commons:</a> 5 provinces, 6 states in the US bordering Canada. Idea that came from the first nations, the native American indians \"we take care of the water because it takes care of us\",<span> important concept which is related to the idea of \"EXCHANGE\" </span>\n\n<a href=\"/t/jonathan-ruffer-and-auckland-castle/3810\">Jonathan Ruffer:</a> is a very rich fund manager in London who calls himself  \"a heavy-duty Christian\" and \"an old fart\". He bought a castle from the Church of England and is now buying also a lot of land off the church; sees himself as a steward, he feels he's called to do this work \n\n<a href=\"/t/amber-film-and-photography-collective/3759\">Amber Film and Video collective in Glasgow</a>: they've been collecting stories around the working class and have a huge archive. When the people are documented, for them it's a validation of their work and being part of a bigger narrative. Documentation as exchange, important for an artist\n\n<a href=\"/t/the-pipe-factory-in-glasgow-scotland-beth-dynowsk/3786\">Pipe Factory in Glasgow:</a> a residency and community art center. Huge volunteering efforts and self care as a critical issue of stewardship - people put off their lives.\n\nDifferent from working in a public sector and taking care of assets.\n\nSelf care is an issue in stewardship. Stewards have a constant tendency to overextend themselves and get burned out or disillusioned.  In Scotland there is legislation around letting communities own property (and in fact they have a \"right to buy\" land that goes up for sale). A similar scheme is now up in England (but in England almost no one uses it). The Scottish scheme is much older.\n\n<strong>Nadia El-Imam</strong>\n\nOn stewardship as an idea of exchange, of doing it for others vs doing it for others or my recognition; In order for it to happen there needs to be a feeling of right to take something - involves a transgression of rules eg Pisolino Libero, inhabiting the public space which in turn protected the neighborhood from drug dealers, recognize something as a common (example managing water) growing awareness, its not a given if you walk pass an underutilized building that someone would neccessary take care of it (state or whatever); lake of trust in the system . \n\nA common problem in stewardship is that, once you start stewarding something, everybody expects you to do a lot more, \"you give the community a finger, they take your arm\".\n\nGrowing awareness that things are not necesarily well run - that someone is fixing that.\n\n<strong>Robin Chase</strong>\n\nIntersection repair is a US example that \"forces\" neighbors to interact.\n\n<strong>Hazem Adel</strong>\n\nIn Egypt communities have a high degree of self-organization, and stewardship happens quite naturally. In the Muslim world there is a tradition of religious charity, so money is quite easily found. However, one person tends to be critical: if she leaves the community, that project will fail until someone else steps in.\n\nYoung architects in Egypt lead community efforts (no state intervention at all) to reorganize even the physical shape of the city. In Al-Mutamidiya, Cairo, the community built 4 ramps to the ring-road while the Mubarak government went down (<a href=\"/en/constructing-a-ring-road-exit-by-the-people-egypt\">https://edgeryders.eu/en/constructing-a-ring-road-exit-by-the-people-egypt</a>). It was initially illegal, but then the police decided to sanction and now the four (highly professionally built) ramps are legal, there is even a small police station built under one of them. \n\n<strong>Caroline Paulick-Thiel</strong>\n\nPrinzessinnengarten is a community-run agricultural project in the middle of Berlin. Knowledge transfer seems to be the main problem there, to make more working structures rather than more projects. Documentation is key. \n\n<strong>Nunzio on the way the Sassi were stewarded back in the days</strong>\n\nI was born in the Sassi, and was evicted as a child in the 1960s. I care about traditional pharmacology in the Sassi. This way of healing is based on the social structure of the Sassi, whose basic unit is vicinato. That is: several dwellings overlooking a very small square with a well and a tub for washing clothes for common use. Commonalities arise around the scarcity of water (three public fountains for 17000 inhabitants in the Sassi, as late as 1930!). The need to share water is the basis of vicinato; then, vicinato becomes a social cell, building in a very cohesive micro-society. Families in the same vicinato help each other economically, but also by caring for each other's health. That's how we get into traditional medicine. Things that were exchanged: tools; herbs spices (parsley, garlic); food (tomatoes); ingredients (yeast). As all communities, vicinato had to manage conflicts. Those were mediated by elders, generally quite successfully. People lived in relative harmony, helped by a very strong sense of belonging.  Women were central in the vicinato. They were \"ageless\"; much the same wrinkles at 25 or 70. Their needs were met by the vicinato (gossiping, emotional support, knowledge sharing). They were of course mothers, and families were very big in the Sassi; my family, with five children, was seen as not that big\". Women would rule the home-cave, where the bedroom, the kitchen and the stable were.&amp;nbsp Medicine was administered by an older, charismatic woman, the comare (co-mother). Illness was understood both religiously and magically: you are ill, it's either divine punishment or evil eye. So healing was done via a maciaro (sorcerer) as much as a doctor.

My feeling is we stick to LOTE to have continuity of event name/brand identity, but we subtitle it something like The Edge of Care. So. LOTE6: The Edge of Care. However if we need to call it Caring on the Edge to fit into the OpenCare structure\u00a0then we use that, but have to make a effort to use that in all our comms. If we use LOTE then we can tap into the heritage of the events that have come before and how they have led us to where we are now.\n\nFinally we want to talk about the central prototype plan:\u00a0<strong>The OpenCare PopUp village.\u00a0</strong>This is the interesting part that we really want to pitch. It's what makes LOTE/COTE 6 special and different from before. It combines everything that has been learned from 5 LOTE events as well as from the Open&amp;Change workshops and the Open Care process. This is our core pitch to cities and what we want them to get excited about.\n\nI would structure it like this: (in brief)\n\nHi City.\n\nWe want you to help us run and host our next <strong>LOTE</strong>, an international unConference and meeting of people from around the world who are exploring the leading edge of science, social policy and living. This one is about Care. We have spent the past 18 months studying cutting edge aspects of care from around the world. We want to come together to discuss, learn and investigate our findings, and we want to do it in your city.\n\nWhat's so great for you? As part of LOTE/COTE we want to set up a brand new idea:\u00a0<strong>The OpenCare PopUp village.\u00a0</strong>This involves reaching out to local initiatives in your city and providing them with a chance to showcase their work in action as part of the big event. We have experience of connecting to these initiatives through our work with the Open&amp;Change project that brought initatives together in Belgium, USA, Greece. We are looking to extend our network and also help you raise international awareness of the great work that citizens and organisations are undertaking in your city. We have a skill of finding and reaching out to organisations and initiatives that operate\u00a0on the fringes as well as in the mainstream.\u00a0\n\nWhy are we doing this/Why your city? This is where we explain the idea of <strong>The Reef</strong>. How it's about creating a physical network that matches our online network. How it's about creating relationships with local governments and citizens. How it's about being hyperlocal and globally connected.\u00a0\n\nThat's my view.

I was surprised by how clear a story it tells, even as I have been using basic analysis techniques. I was interested in two questions:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>During the Twitterstorm many of us experienced effortlessness, even joy in collaboration. Where did it come from? It is not obvious, since we tended to know only some \u2013 or even very few \u2013 other people in it. Effortless collaboration among complete strangers?</li>\n\n<li>Did we build community somehow? Did this sort of flash mob leave behind a permanent trace?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>In a nutshell, what seems to have made collaboration effortless was network architecture.</strong> The overall network partitions naturally into three subcommunities.\u00a0The green people on the left are almost all Italians, living in or near Matera, or with a strong relationship to the city. The blue people on the right are mostly active members of <a href=\"http://ouishare.net\">Ouishare</a>, a community based in Paris. The red people in the middle are the Edgeryders/unMonastery community. Coordination across different subcommunities is achieved by information relaying and relationship brokerage at two levels:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>At the individual level, some \u201cbridging\u201d people connect subcommunities to each other.</strong> For example, alberto_cottica, noemisalantiu, i_dauria and rita_orlando all play a role in connecting the Materans to the edgeryders crowd. On the other side, ladyniasan and elfpavlik are the main connectors between the latter and the Ouishare group.</li>\n\n<li><strong>At the subcommunity level, the ER-uM subcommunity is clearly intermediating between the Materans and Ouisharers</strong>.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Each subcommunity is held together by some locally central, active individuals</strong>. You can see them clearly: piersoft, matera2019 and ida_leone for the Materans; edgeryders and unmonastery for the ER-uM crowd (these have many edges connecting them to the Materans): ouishare and antoleonard for the Ouishare group.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f4b74f25b4df3910ea5a6fd117641773ceba266d.jpg\" width=\"625\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\nAlso in a nutshell, it seems that we did indeed build community. To explain why, I start by resolving the overall Twitterstorm network into a \u201cstatic\u201d network\u00a0 of follower relationships \u2013 representing more or less endorsement and trust \u2013 and an \u201cinstant\u201d network of mentions and retweets \u2013 representing more or less active collaboration in the Twitterstorm. Both partition naturally into the three subcommunities, just as the overall network.\u00a0 Let's look at the action network, and color the nodes: redder nodes have been more active in mentioning and engaging the nodes they are connected to. <strong>The redder areas in the network are not within the subcommunities, but across them</strong>: most of the orange and red edges connect the Matera subcommunity (i_dauria, matera2019, rita_orlando, piersoft) with the ER-uM one (edgeryders, alberto_cottica). On the right, elfpavlik is busy building bridges between Ouisharers and ER-uM. So yes, we did build community. You are looking at community building in action!\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/af94e5b3643e62a73db87f42fe33f6956adf23dc.jpg\" width=\"448\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\nSee a deeper analysis with more visuals at <a href=\"http://goo.gl/5wSYvS\">http://goo.gl/5wSYvS</a>.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-10-22 14:30:30", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:13:58.675188", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 547, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 62.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5279, "user_id": 854, "topic_id": 5246, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/2/22a77a075cf30a309414fe5ca7449edacf2c5b4d.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"377\">\n\nIt is not a huge hyperbole to state that health- and social- care are subjects often wrapped in mistery for most, even for the very beneficiaries.\n\nPoliticians talk of cost savings, and optimization of the throughput, opinion leaders and policy makers of commoditization and user satisfaction, \u2026but is welfare actually a production ecosystem?\n\nAnd what to do of the right to self-determination, in contrast with public health?\n\nOne could dwell ever deeper: have you ever wondered how is the cost of care determined, and how is the effectiveness of an intervention or quality of a provider measured? And deeper yet, how do we know what is acceptable health, and what a disease is? Can we make social wellness really apart from health?\n\nWHO defined health in 1948, as follows: \u201cHealth is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity\u201d, and this definition has never been amended so far. Not too shallow.\u00a0But what does that really mean?\n\nWithout getting too philosophical, I would like to walk with you through some paradoxes of today\u2019s welfare, to figure out how the system makes sense of them, and whether and how this sense making could be reframed to work on alternative solutions.\n\nThis session will feature a provocation from @markomanka followed by an (hopefully) embarrassingly interactive\u00a0Q&amp;A session.

Some of the protagonists are grassroots activists, social innovators, cultural practitioners and successful entrepreneurs. Others are deep state actors, veteran politicians and experienced civil servants. I have no idea what will happen when we come together at \\#lote4 next month but everyone is welcome to <a href=\"/welcome-to-lote4\">join us in shaping it here</a>.\n\nAhead of our gathering to share experiences and forge plans, I think it is important to flag that <strong>we need to learn new ways to think and talk about \"the future\".</strong>\n\nThis all came to a head last month during the KnowLab, an event organised by Unesco, supported by the Rockefeller Foundation and hosted by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (I was there as a participant and Edgeryders is involved in the project design and execution).\n\nWhat came out of the Knowlab is a powerful insight: not everybody can use the future \u2013 in fact most people cannot. The ability to do foresight, and learn from foresight done by others has to be forged. So I'm facilitating a session at LOTE4 on futures literacy.\n\nI have identified five waypoints on the way to <strong>futures literacy</strong> \u2013 each of them an ability itself. For each waypoint, we could interview wise or remarkable people ahead of LOTE4 and ask them how they acquired that particular ability.\n\nThe first ability is the ability to <strong>learn to look beyond one's construction of reality</strong>. One person we could learn how to develop it from is network scientist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_J._Watts\">Duncan Watts</a>. Watts is the author of a book called <em>E</em><em>verything is obvious (once you know the answer),</em>\u00a0in which he passionately and convincingly argues that common sense is lousy at navigating situations that feature a great many agents interacting with each other. In those situations \u2013 which, not coincidentally, include <em>almost all</em>\u00a0real-life business and public policy decisions \u2013\u00a0common sense is actually a liability, and we need to learn to mistrust it and, instead, \"trust the data\".\n\nThe second ability is the ability to <strong>understand that the outlook on the future is contestable ground,\u00a0and why that matters for the present</strong>. We could ask how to do this to <a href=\"http://www.rielmiller.com/\">Riel Miller</a>, head of foresight at UNESCO. Riel has long cultivated a \"militant\" approach to foresight, and is convinced that the way we see the future will reverberate on present decisions, therefore <i>changing\u00a0</i>the future itself.\u00a0\n\nThe third ability is the ability to <strong>think like a complexity scientist</strong>, leaving behind narrativised accounts of reality and teaching oneself to recognise emergence\u00a0and self-organisation. We could ask how he did that to <a href=\"http://www.unep.org/champions/laureates/2012/Leeuw.asp\">Sander van der Leeuw</a>, archeologist of innovation, Santa Fe Institute scholar, and Dean of the School of sustainability at Arizona State University, who has relentlessly pursued a <em>very</em> long-term view on social and economic system dynamics \u2013 \u00a0and this has recently led him to conclude that \"innovation is a Ponzi scheme\".\u00a0\n\nThe fourth ability is the ability to <strong>learn from others already using the future</strong>. Here we draw on the experience of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiNc2ArMGck\">Giulio Quaggiotto</a>, currently heading the UN Pulse Lab. He has systematically worked to build an ecosystem of colleagues and practitioners of foresight (and other things) to learn from, with particular attention to outliers, radical experimenters and, recently... big data.\n\nThe fifth ability is the ability to <strong>manage the tension between the need for sense-making and the need to act</strong>. Perhaps we could ask <a href=\"http://re.silience.com/\">Vinay Gupta</a> how he developed his. He is a scholar and a practitioner of foresight, but he is also a doer, spearheading his own game-changing effort in the resilience crowd, particularly with the <a href=\"http://hexayurt.com/\">Hexayurt project</a>.\u00a0\n\nYes I know it's all men and predominantly from certain parts of the world. I got the ball rolling now I need help from you to make this more diverse :)\n\nDo you have other people you would like to learn these abilities from? Why? Let us know who they are and what your reasons are for wanting to learn from then, and we will see what we can do to accommodate you.\n\nPlease share your thoughts in a comment below or email nadia@edgeryders.eu\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\nDate: 2014-10-25 13:30:00 - 2014-10-25 13:30:00, Europe/Brussels Time.", "created_at": "2014-09-23 13:32:29", "updated_at": "2017-09-15 09:41:24.885116", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 914, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 60.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1541, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8544, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 5885, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Reportage au Logement 123  (l'habitat collectif)</b>\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/GzdpYXGmiYc\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-25 11:41:32", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:49.349298", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 27, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25843, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 4139, "post_number": 25, "raw": "We have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/matslats/status/562090925602504704\">talked a bit before</a>, right? So, hello again, welcome to Edgeryders, and thank you for contributing! I value your opinion a lot, esp. because you have a different take on the alternative economic exchange topic.\n\n&gt; Are you looking to support the government, and if so, have you enquired what the government intends for economic development?\n\nThis one. Or rather, to support the Greek people, but in this case the difference is (hopefully) not big. I don't care about funding here \u2013 if this works, it will be an honor to support the Greek people. And if I believe this idea can work to help them, I have kind of a moral obligation to tell them, no?\n\nSo, it's \"just\" an experimental, radical proposal to contribute to the discussion, like Yanis Varoufakis' just-as-radical <a href=\"http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/2014/02/15/bitcoin-a-flawed-currency-blueprint-with-a-potentially-useful-application-for-the-eurozone/\">FT-Coin proposal</a>. It's <em>not</em> \"ready\" to try on national level in a conventional sense of \"ready\". What does \"ready\" mean under crisis conditions though? Purely from an innovation perspective, WW2 was a fruitful time because lots of outlandish ideas were tried and some turned out to work well.\n\nYou're right to relate the proposal to multilateral circular barter: it's a generalization of that, working with networks rather than circles / loops, which improves market clearing. It can work without credit, though adding a bit of either P2P credit or currency / currencies helps quite a bit.\n\nWhen using a barter / currency hybrid system, it can connect multiple complementary currencies / community currencies into an intra-community trading system. Currencies are simply traded as commodities, like other products. One would simply order only the currencies one trusts in, from everyone who offers them and whom one trusts to deliver. This respects the requirement of local trust within each currency community, while still allowing to trade with people from other communities using inter-community network barter. For Greece, it could look like an ecosystem of 100 or more local currencies (most of which probably exist already), connected with a credit-free barter system between them. Sounds like yet another radical proposal: a way to make complementary currencies applicable for nation-wide trading. It seems to solve the challenges that a single national complementary would otherwise have (as stated by Yanis Varoufakis ... ah, here, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3uNIgDmqwI#t=5448\">this part of his \"Erratic Marxist\" speech</a>). What do you think, is there a need for a community currency clearinghouse like this? And, could it work?\n\n", "created_at": "2015-02-26 10:01:03", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:22.662932", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 463, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [23986], "is_liked_by": [2500], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1354, "user_id": 605, "topic_id": 1321, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hello everyone,\u00a0\n\nmy name is Chara and\u00a0I come originally from Athens, Greece. Even if I love Greece and especially my city, I prefer to refer to myself more as a European citizen rather than Greek. This is not a statement about anti chauvist feelings but it is a way of life and routine.\n\nI grew up quite internationally, or better say \"Europeanly\". When I was a kid and a teenager, I went to a Franco - Hellenique school and all the summers I was sent in summer schools around Europe. Later, during my first university years when I did a BA in Business Administration and Management, I joined AIESEC, the biggest student association in the world in which I remained a very active member and leader (Local Commitee President) for three years. Being a member in AIESEC meant also participating in international conferences and connecting with people from abroad. After these three years, I took the desicion to go on Erasmus for six months in Belgium where I had some of the nicest and happiest moments of my life ( I could keep talking for ever about my Erasmus but not so relevant I guess..). I could refer to my Erasmus time as \"the connecting and meeting people\" time when I made some of my best and life lasting friendships at that period. When I finished my BA, I decided to do a Masters on International Advertising in Paris and London (cooperational schools) because I have always been fascinated about the cross cultural education, marketing and advertising. How different people get the stimulus to act and how that does affect on their minds. How copy writing and colours create different feelings in different nations and other cultural differences' issues.. This degree made me think about my general attitude towards the new, the different and unexpected information.\n\nI am generally so much into the different and the strange that I am always looking for it. I believe that you can find this element only if you are very open to all the new. If you experience new things and different situations, if you get involved with the people you meet, if you really \"live\" the city you are and not just being a tourist. I like to experience a situation as much as I can and I think that on every occasion and from every single person you meet, you have something to take out of it/him/her.\n\nThe thing is that as I am always looking for the new and the different, sometimes I ended up a bit lost and undecided about what to do with my life and especially when it comes to professional issues. What I really want to do if I always want something new and something to keep me exhited and motivated? Which is the best way to deal with the question \"what do you want to become when grow up\"? I still dont know the correct answer... But I want to keep eyes and ears open to all the possibilities coming up.. At the end we should give ourselves the chance to learn more about this world and its people.\n\nMy life moto would be: keep asking questions, get inspired by the unknown, meet better the people and environment that surround you :)\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-02-16 12:31:15", "updated_at": "2018-06-03 07:24:21.632654", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 568, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 751, "user_id": 3418, "topic_id": 718, "post_number": 1, "raw": "HELLENIC ASSOCIATION FOR MOOD DISORDERS \"MAZI\" (\u201ctogether\u201d in Greek), is\u00a0a non-profit organization established at 2010 by the majority of people with personal experience (patients and relatives) with Mood Disorders, friends of these people and professional experts with a special interest to participate in the effort of the association.\u00a0The aim of the association is to support, empower and inform people suffering from mood disorder, their families\u00a0and friends.\u00a0The main vehicle for achieving this goal was the creation and support self-help groups for people with Mood Disorder.\n\nIn various foreign countries such groups (self-help or support groups) already count several years of experience and have proven their importance for effective self-management of Mood Disorders (in addition to any treatment). MAZI aspired to fill this gap in Greece.\u00a0At this moment there are 3 groups in Athens and one in Thessaloniki.\u00a0The ultimate goal is the creation and support of a nationwide network of regional annexes empowerment of people with mood disorder and mental health promotion.\n\nDuring the meet ups of MAZI\u2019s self-help groups, the participants share their experiences, personal feelings, information and strategies that have been developed to deal with mood disorder and live a fulfilling life. These sessions are about peer-support through sharing personal experiences, knowledge, concerns, worries and strategies.\n\nParticipants are people who have been diagnosed with mood disorder (Major Depressive Disorder, Dysthymic Disorder, Bipolar Disorder I and II and cyclothymic disorder). The groups often include relatives and friends of people with mood disorder. These groups do not have a therapeutic clinical role and therefore do not replace or supersede any medical, psychiatric or psychotherapeutic treatment that the participants may receive.\n\nThere are no expert lectures and no self-pity parties. These self-help groups are meet ups of optimism, hope and encouragement. The specific objectives of the programme are:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\tto support and encourage members in regaining control and improving the quality of their lives and their relationships.</li>\n\n<li>\tto provide an environment of emotional support, which reduces isolation and alienation, moderates despair and increases optimism, personal responsibility and self-acceptance.</li>\n\n<li>\tto help members extract greater joy and satisfaction from life, in spite of difficulties, obstacles, frustrations and setbacks.</li>\n\n<li>\tto help members learn and practice new, more effective and satisfactory ways of relating to others.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nIt is a collective and individual responsibility of each group member to make the discussion a safe place for sharing. We respect confidentiality, treating each other with respect, courtesy, understanding and compassion. Anyone wishing to share something has the opportunity to do so, with no participant monopolising the group\u2019s time. The group allows each participant to speak without interruptions and side conversations. Everything said there, stays there, following the prime rule of confidentiality which must be respected and observed by all. This rule is only lifted when a member declares that it intends to do harm to himself/herself or to others.\n\nIt is OK to share, but whoever doesn\u2019t want to, is not obliged to do it. We are all equal, and no distinctions are permitted on the basis of gender, race or age. Everyone has the right to their own opinion and tries not to impose the accuracy or uniqueness of these views. We use the \u201cI\u201d language (or \u201cI message\u201d), we don\u2019t teach, command or advise others. We only share our experiences, ie. \u201caccording to my own experience, it is very helpful to\u2026\u201d rather than \u201cwhat you should do\u2026\u201d\n\nThis is not a program based on the \u201c12 step\u201d principle (ie. Alcoholics Anonymous). MAZI holds that each person has the knowledge and ability to find his personal path to \u2018cure'. Hence, the groups are not based<b> on any particular theoretical approach, except the value of established self-help and peer-support in a safe and non-critical environment. </b>\n\nFrom October 2014 until April 2016, MAZI\u00a0participated as\u00a0main partner in the program ''Citizens against depression\".\u00a0The Programme aimed to strengthen civil society and enhance the contribution of NGOs to social justice, democracy and sustainable development.\u00a0This project was\u00a0funded by the Greek NGO Programme \u201cWe are all Citizens\u201d which is part of the EEA &amp; Norway Grants for Greece.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/qIdMwF4KMUw\n\nOur main problem is the lack of our place. And this prevents us to carry out many other goals we have in order to fill the ever increasing needs of greek\u00a0society on mental health.\u00a0It is known that the financial crisis in our country makes it even more difficult. We need all the assistance that could be given in every way.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-18 18:27:57", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 04:59:47.240249", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 859, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 28.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11038, "user_id": 82, "topic_id": 1552, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>That is exactly why I'm going:</b>\n\nbecause, Web conversation goes nicely with real life event, and usually gives more buzz and more results\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-04 00:04:38", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:03.624354", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 31, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27449, "user_id": 3374, "topic_id": 691, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>Thank you!</b>\n\n@Noemi, Thank you for clarifying that!
