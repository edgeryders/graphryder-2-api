Some heavy recruiting has been done offline, taking advantage of being in Matera live and streaming in order to understand what was the perception of the unMonastery and the LOTE3\u00a0<em>in situ</em>. Back in Brussels, on with spreading the buzz once I finally managed to read all that has been produced during this month. First of all: WOW! Seriously, this is getting big. However, I felt like sharing some thoughts and ideas which matured while benefitting from exchanges\u00a0<em>de visu</em> with Nadia, Alberto, Rita and others very interested in the LOTE3 + unMonastery... some of this stuff confirms some of the observations that have been developed online during these weeks:\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>the <a href=\"/t/lote3/312\">LOTE3</a> <strong>website </strong>appears hectic to those who come for the first time. Personally, I also think that this is because people ar used to associate the communication of an event with a premade package of \"about/program/info\" ecc. This is not what the LOTE is about. However, maybe it could help to have - on the program page - a grid with the days and the proposed sessions up to now, with a distinctive picture, a link to the threaded proposal, the person \"in charge\" to contact and a place where to sign up and meet. This would automatically register you to the event.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>The <strong>program grid</strong>: there are the 3 main sessions, in each of them you have different panels. Some of them superpose, some not: we will not all be attending everything - because so much stuff will be proposed. From the <a href=\"/t/making-lote3/360/skilling-up-for-online-collaboration\">online upskilling</a> to the gureilla knitting, to the <a href=\"/t/making-lote3/360/crowdfunding-doing-by-learning/learning-by-doing\">crowdfunding </a>session, passing from the <a href=\"/t/making-lote3/360/photoshooting-how-all-edgeryders-watching-matera-territory\">photoshooting </a>and the pasta party... (as I write this I'm looking for Valentina's and Rita's posts on the pasta and knitting but cannot seem to find them on the Tracks and track proposal part...). Having this grid would also enable us to fuel people whom we might think could be interested in the session and get them to register and participate. This would also start setting the rythm to the whole event: it is important for logistics: for example if we get the Lucanian cooks and the coldiretti to support the pasta party, we will have to start blocking the session now (date, hour and place) in order to start checking out who's available and who is not. We are in the South of Italy. To much of the DIY spirit on one side can bring to uncommitment on the other :-)</li>\n\n<li>while speaking in Matera, this great idea came up for the <strong>plates, cutlery and cups</strong>: there is a (small) budget for the unMon's software however we will need stuff for the LOTE3 so why not use the LOTE3 to initiate the making of the plates and cups by local artisans - the budget would pay for the raw material. I spoke directly to some artisans, who were ready to take up the challenge... however said that October was way to early. I was thinking maybe we could test 2 ways: on one hand have some of the artisans make 5 plates for the unMon, on the other one could use the recollection of objects and needed material as a way to pubblicize the event:\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Alice nel paese della Marranella is a good exaple of this (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmdjKTg9JLE\">video</a>): in a very densely populated neighbourhood of Rome, with many different nationalities, <strong>the organization of the \"festa della Marranella\" becomes a way to communicate the event</strong> to very diverse people and situations: food, pans, plates, tables, ecc. are given by the shopkeepers, neighbours, schools, ecc. who then ensure their presence since they have contributed to the making of. The Sassi are filled with restaurants, some families live there: we could involve artists and inhabitants in the walk to recollect the material necessary for the LOTE inviting everybody. The video shows how initial individual suspicion gets overcome by group dynamics. If every restaurant in the Sassi gives out 2 plates, we would have a number :-) same with the ingredients...\u00a0</li>\n\n<li><strong>accomodation</strong>: Rita and I have been brainstorming and we wanted to highlight that sleeping at a Materano's home might not leave you all the autonomy of movement you might be expecting. We wanted to make this clear, although we don't want to alarm you guys. Since we know the city, and the neighbourhoods, we just wanted to send a quick reminder that sleeping at someone's place might lead bring you to have to cope with other issues. We are going to publish a list of b&amp;b's which are willing to do a special price for those who spend more than 3 nights in a row .</li>\n\n<li><strong>transportation </strong>from Bari to Matera. brainstorming with Rita again, we are going to publish the hours of buses and trains (4\u20ac one way)</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nI've been speaking to Giuseppe (post on photoshooting), <a href=\"http://laurenttrezegnies.blogspot.be/\">Laurent Trezeignies</a> (wants to tape the Sassi), Jean Amoris (<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/44326279\">Echoes from the future</a>), <a href=\"http://www.officinecargonauta.it/\">Luisa Lapacciana</a> (scrap books of Matera while walking) about the LOTE3: Giuseppe made it to the post (hurray!) the others got a bit lost on their way (somewhere between threads and registration :)... However, I was wondering: there's all this creative stuff popping up, do you think the best session would be the Unconference on the Edge?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-09-04 22:49:56", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:08.214235", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1021, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24139, "user_id": 2687, "topic_id": 4525, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>Great leaders</b>\n\nI personally think that the key for the three issues that <em>Meenabhatta</em> presents, lies in the leaders.\n\n<em><strong>First:\u00a0 how to keep the existing community spirit alive and mobilize it for the purpose of reconstruction activities;</strong></em>\n\nSome leaders must remain after this \"momentum\", and they will be mostly the ones who keep the spirit alive and think and act beyond the reconstruction.\n\n<em><strong>Second, how best can international community help to reconstruct Nepal and maintain community resiliency at the same time;</strong></em>\n\nIt seems quite obvious that the current Nepali maximum leaders will not be a motivation for the International communities to keep making efforts for Nepal, once the situation gets back to \"normal\" (if we can even call it normal). We need then other people, reliables ones, who call for regular aid from the International community and give reports and accurate information in exchange, in order to maintain the credibility and enthusiasm.\n\n<strong>Third and perhaps the most important one is can these groups of \u2018island of civility\u2019 be trusted enough to take up broader responsibilities in shaping Nepal\u2019s political future and civil society?</strong>\n\nIf we get to \"produce\" great leader, yes, they will be able to do so.\n\nAnd why do I use the word \"produce\"? I propose to select a limited number of those people who are showing to have the skills and, mostly, the willingness and attitude for being a leader. And then teach them, create an especial (ad-hoc) education program that turns these \"amateur\" leaders into \"proffesional\", greatest ones. Based on the know-how of the International and local experts, and also well advised by locals to use the most understandable language, we can create a kind of master degree to become a leader.\n\n1. So, first, what kind of attitudes, skills and characters should we consider for making the previous selection of the leaders? (preferably locals)\n\nSome such as\n\n- Honesty\n\n- Communication. For this, sense of humor is more important that it may seem to be (\"If you want to tell people the truth, make them laugh, otherwise they'll kill you.\" - Oscar Wilde)\n\n- Confidence\n\n- Commitment\n\n- Positive Attitude\n\n- Ability to Inspire\n\n- Creativity\n\n- Ability to Delegate\n\n- Etc.\n\nOf course the previous experiences in leadership will be valued.\n\n2. And what to teach them?\n\nA) Personal values and skills. Subjects like:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Personal Self-Confidence\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Enthusiasm - Inspiration\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Self-Control\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - The habit of saving\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Gratitude\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Doing more than getting paid for\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - The gap between Ideal and Reality\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - The 80% model (Pareto principle)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Pleasing personality\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Accurate thinking\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Concentration\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Cooperation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Tolerance\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - The Golden Rule: what you give, you will get (call it the law of Cause and Effect, or just karma, if you prefer)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Desire (success always begins with strong desire)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Faith\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Autosuggestion (how to convince your own subconscious mind that you are capable to do what you are intending to do \u2014 never forget that everything is potentially possible)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Imagination / creativity (\"Many people think they are thinking when they are merely rearranging their prejudices.\")\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Intuition (how to get the knowledge/wisdom without having to be processed by the mind, meditation is a great tool for this)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Organized planning\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Decision\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Nothing is more difficult, and therefore more precious, than to be able to decide.\"\u00a0\u2014 Napoleon Bonaparte\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Once you make a decision, the universe conspires to make it happen.\" \u2014 Ralph Waldo Emerson\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Persistence\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - The power of the Master Mind. This is concept introduced by Napoleon Hill in his famous book \"Think and Grow Rich\". The Master Mind Alliance is the union of two or more powerful, complementary minds, that are able to reach much greater results than a single mind (something like what we are doing in edgeryders)\n\nB) Some necessary disciplines\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Team management\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Project and time management\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 - Psychology\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 - Emotional Intelligence and NLP (Neuro Linguistic Programming)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Coaching and mentorship\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Metaphysics\n\nC) More specialized knowledge, such us:\n\n- Social/politic sciences\n\n- Economics\n\n- International protocol\n\n- Laws\n\n- National and international geography\n\n- National and international History\n\n- Health\n\n- Etc.\n\n--------------\n\nA) are the core values that every \"good\" leader should assimilate into his/her character and consequently convey to the people, even unconsciously.\n\nB) are some disciplines that I consider very valuable for a leader.\n\nC) consist in more specialized knowledge that the leader will require once she/he start taking over of posts of greater responsibility.\n\nI suggest also that the selected leaders are regularly monitored by edgeryders and untimately by UN, in order to:\n\n- Make sure they are performing in the expected way.\n\n- Assist them psychologically and spiritually, something necessary when the people face new situations and tasks, especially for positions of big responsibility. It is not rare in those cases that the person experiences stress, anxiety and other potential deseases.\n\n- Advise them in terms of protocol, clothing, etc.\n\n- Keep a constant education, whenever it is necessary \u2014 mostly the list C)\n\nIt is proved along the History that the greatest Human achievements have usually a common factor: a great leader.\n\nJust to mention two: Leonidas I king of Sparta (epically portrayed in the famous film \"300\") and, in a more pacific and advisable way, Mothama Gandhi.\n\nTherefore, taking advantage of the unconventional current situation in Nepal, let's \"produce\" great leaders from people with the proper character, then support and monitor them in a regular basis, and we can reach amazing -till now unimaginable- results.\n\n<div id=\"stcpDiv\" style=\"position: absolute;

In one project taking place at the lab, members are engineering yeast to express milk proteins from non-animal sources - next generation of vegan cheeses and milk. Others are busy developing an eco-friendly bacterial sunscreen.\n\n<a href=\"http://openinsulin.org/\">Open Insulin</a> is one of these projects, and its goal is to make it simpler and less expensive to make insulin, starting by investigating some novel ideas for making insulin in e. coli using fewer, easier steps than in common industrial protocols. If successful, the members hope it can be a step towards making generic production more economical, and might also enable more participation in research related to insulin, or production of the medicine at smaller scale, closer to the patients who need it, further reducing costs and giving access to more patients who lack it.\n\nCounter Culture Labs was founded by a group of hackers with diverse backgrounds and interests in the period from 2011 to 2012, with some members coming from <a href=\"https://sudoroom.org/\">Sudo Room</a>, another hackerspace in Oakland that I participated in founding. Many were also involved in Occupy Oakland, and wanted to establish a more permanent organization with the same community spirit and values. Other members came from <a href=\"http://biocurious.org/\">Biocurious</a>, another biohacking space in Sunnyvale, in the southern end of the Bay Area. I became involved both because I shared the desire to build a community-focused institution, and because I have diabetes type 1 myself, which means I live with the frustration of costly and tedious treatment regimens day in and day out, and I know how much the standard of care for diabetes patients lags behind what recent research suggests might be possible. So, for my own sake, and for the sake of the others with the condition, I sought to take whatever steps I could to close the gap between the research and what is available to patients on the market right now.\n\nAbout a year ago, some long-standing discussions around making a bioreactor to produce insulin, which had inspired a few previous attempts, turned more concrete when Isaac Yonemoto, another independent researcher of medical treatments, made <a href=\"http://blog.indysci.org/insulin-is-hard-but-not-impossible/\">some suggestions to us</a> about interesting possibilities for innovation and improvement in existing protocols. We started organising regular meetings, and out of those we then organized <a href=\"https://experiment.com/projects/open-insulin\">a successful crowdfunding campaign</a>, which then opened up connections to professionals who work on various aspects of the problem, both the science and engineering around insulin, and the questions of access to medicine. Through this it came to our attention that access to insulin lags far behind the need even now, and even in the most developed countries - costs of insulin are prohibitive even to many people in the US - and all in all, roughly 50% of those in the world who require it have no access to insulin at all, according to the <a href=\"http://www.100campaign.org/\">100 Campaign</a>, a group working on improving access to insulin around the world. There is almost no generic insulin on the American market at the moment - the first one appeared on the market about two weeks after we finished our crowdfunding campaign last year, but it is a long acting type, which is only part of the therapy required by people with diabetes type 1 (about 15-20% of diabetics in USA have type 1; the rest have type 2). And for those who use an insulin pump, short acting insulin is necessary.\n\nThe general problem in the first world is that the incentives and interests of producers and patient communities are not aligned.\n\nRight now we\u2019re focused on achieving the first scientific milestones, which is to produce proinsulin, the precursor of the active form of insulin, in e. coli, in our small-scale community lab. Our lab runs mostly on donated and salvaged equipment and reagents and might be comparable in its capabilities to a lab in a less-developed area of the world where there is the least access to insulin. If we succeed, it would show the possibility that small-scale producers in remote areas might be able to make insulin to satisfy local demand, in places where centrally-manufactured supplies can\u2019t reach due to lack of infrastructure - where what roads there are, if any, do not let refrigerated trucks pass to ship needed pharmaceuticals in. Once we have a protocol that embraces everything from production to purification to near the level of purity of pharmaceutical grade insulin, we plan to approach established generics manufacturers with a case for the economic feasibility of serving the unserved market for insulin, and to partner with them to do the rest of the work of achieving sufficient purity of the product and scaling the methods to production. As we proceed with our work, the main batch of patents around the various forms of insulin are expiring, which will further help us make the case for a comprehensive portfolio of treatments to potential generics manufacturers.\n\nProvided all this goes well, we might then pursue another idea, closer to our original hope of a bioreactor that produces insulin, and a kind of \u2018holy grail\u2019 goal in the DIY bio world, which is a desktop biofactory, an analog of desktop 3D printers, but for proteins and biologics, which we might develop to first execute one of our protocols to produce insulin, but which we might also design with more flexibility in mind. This would consist of a bioreactor portion that could grow a culture of e. coli or yeast, and then extract and purify a product from it - very roughly speaking, the union of a fermenter with an FPLC, a piece of equipment that purifies proteins. If that is possible, supply of insulin could be placed very close to the demand of the diabetics around the world in a simple, economical package, and reliance on distribution infrastructure would be minimized. It would also reduce the need to have skilled technicians with years of lab experience to execute these protocols by hand.\n\nUltimately, I hope that opening up the tools for research to more people can help to bring research on cures to patients, and not just treatments. Let me mention a few of the more promising ideas that have had some success in research settings. One approach is to implant functioning pancreatic cells from a donor and protect them from immune attack by various means - hard to scale if you need a constant supply of donors,but it might be possible to grow cultures of the cells in vitro to address this. Another approach is to get the immune system to cease its attack on pancreatic cells, and promote the regrowth of the body\u2019s own insulin-producing cells, either in the pancreas, or in another tissue via gene therapy - a simpler approach to apply once it is developed. Some of the ideas use very inexpensive supplies such as adjuvants, the materials in vaccines that provoke an immune response - and there has been some success using adjuvants alone, or with carefully chosen additions, to get the bodies of diabetic patients to reduce or cease their autoimmune attacks. Other concepts address the metabolic changes behind type 2 diabetes. Several drugs between the research and commercial worlds of medicine can act directly on the metabolic control mechanisms of the body, changing its pattern of energy use and other aspects of metabolism back from the pathological state of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes to the normal, healthy base state. Some of them are small organic molecules, easier to make than proteins such as insulin, but due in part to reasons of cost and incumbency, are not mainstream treatments yet.\n\nAt the most general level, what we seek to prove is that if an order of magnitude more people get involved in research and development of science and technology, medicine can progress much faster, and might no longer be held back by institutional constraints and perverse incentives in the economics of the institutions. Right now, we\u2019re a group about half a dozen people working regularly on the project, with a few dozen more people in touch every now and then to help out, and a hundred or two in the extended community, ready to answer a question or call for help. Every week or two, someone new comes to the group, who just learned about the project via the media or our regular meetups, and wants to help. Some are complete beginners and end up taking our introductory classes to biohacking, some already have experience but got tired of the limits of the institutions where they worked, or have relatives with diabetes and want to contribute to progress. Though we\u2019re building up a broader community of participation in research slowly, we hope our efforts can plant many seeds out of which future innovations will grow.\n\nMeanwhile, we are looking to broaden a circle of people who can advise us, experienced scientists and engineers who can help us troubleshoot issues that inevitably come up when investigating the unknown, but we also hope to inspire other groups to work independently in a broader community of innovation. We would like to set up a network of both institutional and DIY researchers living all around the world who have different approaches and ways of making insulin as well as tackling other diabetes and health related issues. Beyond producing drugs, participants might research questions of access to medicine, investigate what patient communities need the most, look at academic publications to identify the most promising research that is not making it out to serve patients, or help establish the effort to build the desktop biofactory. Part of our goal is to prove it\u2019s possible and worthwhile for people outside institutions to take the initiative on these questions, and inspire others to take the lead in their own efforts and bring about the broader changes we seek.\n\nDo you have any projects in health, medicine, or biohacking that you\u2019d like to work on, but lack people, knowledge, or resources to make it happen? Are you working on a diabetes-related solution? Or do you feel like a network of care biohackers is something you\u2019d like to get involved with?

Libraries were subsequently established to provide\u00a0<strong style=\"border: 0px; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">access</strong>\u00a0to learning and advancement for people who would otherwise have limited opportunities for education or self-improvement. Their purpose, then, was educational and they were to be spaces open to everyone in a community who wanted access to books and learning. The provision of access to information, knowledge and learning continues to characterise public libraries in the twenty-first century. Nowadays, however, libraries are fast evolving to become what some have termed \u2018read/write\u2019 platforms that provide access to broad-ranging media as well as multi-media manipulation tools. The information with which they\u2019re concerned increasingly includes data that is stored electronically, and library services themselves straddle the offline/online world.\n\nThe emergence of \u2018library-hack-makerspaces\u2019 is, then, very welcome \u2013 not least, insofar as they harbour the potential for STEAM skills development at the very heart of our communities, in keeping with libraries\u2019 educational remit. And, yet, we\u2019ve still to witness a thoroughgoing disruption of libraries\u2019 twentieth century institutional boundaries \u2013 ideally, to establish knowledge production on an equal footing with knowledge consumption, reflecting the democratisation of the means of reproduction in the Western world. That is, we\u2019ve still to see twenty-first century libraries established as bona fide peer-to-peer platforms for the purposes of facilitating knowledge\u00a0<strong style=\"border: 0px; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">exchange\u00a0</strong>founded upon Commons principles.\n\nWe believe that library services should provide access to and enable development of a multimedia commons. Our modest team is using its expertise in design, technology, community engagement and enterprise to work closely with library service users and providers.\u00a0We are empowering x3 prototypes at present to co-design and deliver activities that are responsive to evolving needs, and always with a view to rendering library services more sustainable in their appeal to broad-ranging audiences. And, we\u2019re game to help prototype most things \u2013 from community publishing platforms to \\#opendata access points.\n\nBut, we\u2019re also eager to work with people who are interested in exploring the potential for peer-to-peer knowledge exchange to be underpinned by adaptation of the \\#blockchain used by cryptocurrency developers - where the introduction of an oracle machine might make it possible for \\#humansearch to once again add value, albeit in more of a virtual library context...\n\nOur team benefits from extensive experience working with the public and third sectors as well as with creative industry professionals.

People can hang out in Matera for longer anyway if they so wish.

Second, work to renovate the unMon building is finally starting.\u00a0The caveat is that if the building wont be fully equipped in time, other than water supply, heating, electricity, etc: it\u2019s us who\u2019ll need to get a hold of equipment, chairs &amp; tables, and all we need to be confy in our sessions and larger activities. If you want to get very cheap - as in free - accommodation and sleep right in the building, don\u2019t hold up great hopes! yes there;s still a chance people can sleep on mats, but KEEPING IN MIND the high humidity in the place, and the late autumn temperatures!\n\n<a href=\"/t/making-lote3/360/summary-of-lote3-community-call-12\" style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 23px;\">Community Call \\#12, Sep 6th</a>\n\n<span>the number of registered participants:\u00a0104, but not everyone is sure to attend.

Thank you Gazbee!</em>\n\nHey everyone!!!!\n\nSo instead of preparing and thinking long and hard about what I'm about to write, I decided to just go for it and let the words flow by themselves.\u00a0\n\n<span>For the workshop in <span>Cairo</span>, I honestly had no idea what to expect or what the outcomes would be. I remember Nadia saying she was purposefully vague about everything so as to let everyone decide for themselves which path the workshop will take. And this notion of 'minds wide open' is definitely what led to the success of the two days.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>The idea of just opening yourself to others didn't seem like it could really be achieved in just two days, because it's very hard to build trust. But it turns out that it's not that you have to build trust first and then honesty follows, it's actually the opposite..if you're honest trust will be built quickly.</span>\n\n<span>In<span> Egypt</span>, (and this is my personal opinion; which was also reflected by others at the workshop), skepticism and individualism are two barriers to collaboration. People tend to value their own work greatly, are generally skeptical of other people's intentions and are afraid of losing grasp or control of what they've been trying to achieve. Therefore, collaboration is very rare, and if it happens it's usually between people that already know each other very well, even though they may lack a lot of the needed resources, hence slowing the road to success.\u00a0</span>\n\nBut, <span>what I discovered or learned is that why waste time doing things by yourself that you may not be able to handle, and look for others that have the capacities, expertise and resources that you lack and you can feed off one another to build something amazing. If skepticism is removed from the equation, people will really work together well and if you put your ideas out there, the one's that are trustworthy and truly care for the cause will show interest. So simply, by sharing your ideas without any limits you'll attract the right people. Collective action is key, and that's why I chose to quote Nadia in the title for this blogpost because '.....we have to remind ourselves that we can be giants together' perfectly sums up everything i'm trying to say.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>I think for me, that was the most important outcome from the workshop. To raise the idea of collaboration to truly have an impact on the society that you live in and care about. There should be no skepticism because at the end of the day it's in the whole community's best interest that we work together. I was also very surprised as to how all the talented and creative attendees were so open to changing their mindset, were honest, and are truly willing to work together.</span>\n\n<span>It was mentioned more than once by different participants that they have forgotten how to communicate and that they've missed that feeling a lot and were happy to meet so many like-minded people. So as a follow up to the workshop, the first step would be\u00a0<strong>communication.\u00a0</strong>Don't lose interest, don't lose trust in yourself and others, and don't wait. What we tend to do, is get so excited during an event, workshop or whatever and then completely forget about it. Trust in the fact that there are some people out there that really want to help, so stop wasting time and go for it. Everyone's here on the platform for the same reason and intentions, so whatever is on your mind just put it out there and let the magic happen :) Also, take a look at what other people are doing and you might find something you never knew you'd be interested in and YOU could be of help to them, and you really can create amazing things. Finally, accept criticism because at the end of the day it leads to real improvement and impact.\u00a0</span>\n\nSecondly, from an institutional perspective, <span>I understand that a lot of people don't want to work with institutions for their bureaucratic processes, top-down approach, and that they see little impact from implemented projects. But this is not necessarily the way things have to continue, and this is why we are taking part in this. We're in a new era where citizens are realizing that monetary resources aren't a necessity, there is no need to rely on big institutions and that we can just do/make things for ourselves with the support and resources of one another...and this is what leads to grassroot communities formulating such as on EdgeRyders.\u00a0</span>\n\nBut the truth is that we really want to help and genuinely care, if we didn't we wouldn't be experimenting with this new methodology and wouldn't be here trying to reach out to you.<span> We want to keep up and we really want to be part of the big changes happening in our societies. We want to work more closely with citizens who have the solutions to their own problems, because we won't always know the answer. So many people are coming up with really cool and effective solutions for our deepest challenges and frustrations, and we need to put our 'minds' together to see how we can support each other. Collaboration doesn't have to happen at the personal or individual level, but between individuals and institutions. I am certain that we will have resources and capacities that would be of great benefit, and vice versa. Therefore, we have to put our heads together and really think about how we can help each other out. We have to build trust with one another and COMMUNICATE. We believe it's important for us to reach out to different channels and to those we normally don't work with so as to widen the possibilities for great things to happen; this is what we've been trying to do!</span>\n\n<span>As<span><span> UNDP</span>, we are open to any suggestions or ideas of what you would like to see happen as the next step, so please feel free to share any thoughts. We already discussed the possibility of replicating these workshops in different governorates throughout Egypt to spread the culture and to see what other ideas people have. But that will be in parallel to seeing how we can move forward with the already-existing participants in STF and finding ways in which we can support each other. If you need any help, know that we want to help you. We are here to learn from you, and we hope that you can also learn something from us</span>.</span>\n\nI<span> think it was more of a conceptual and mental journey for all of us, where we were reminded of things we\u2019ve forgotten and learned about new things that we might have not believed in before or even thought about. We were reminded to dream big, and those dreams can become reality of we collectively dream. We changed our perceptions and mind-set of working individually and being skeptical of others, we learned that there are genuine and like-minded people out there who share the same aspirations, we learned to open our minds and ourselves to one another and that sharing resources, capacities and experiences will lead to faster and greater results. This is just the beginning of our journey TOGETHER, and we are excited to see where we go next! Don't let the conversation stop!!!!!</span>\n\nP.s. Thank you Nadia for being passionate about what you do; very inspiring! and thank you everyone for believing in change, and contributing with your hearts and souls. Finally, thanks to Ice Cairo, Ahmed and Hazem for all their efforts in making this happen..awesome job everyone!!!!\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-28 12:02:50", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:15.806876", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1602, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 342.6, "like_count": 12, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 5, 1935, 1818, 1988, 2077, 1856, 2053, 1861, 2095, 2201, 3964], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4499, "user_id": 2580, "topic_id": 4466, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://heymarie.ro/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/WORKSHOP-poster.jpg\" style=\"width: 80%; height: 80%;\">\n\n<em>We\u2019ve got quite a diverse local crowd gathering on Edgeryders, guys, so it\u2019s time to start designing a workshop to address the <a href=\"/t/discoveries-in-the-community-so-far/4461\">pains</a> we raised when joining Spot the Future.

That\u2019s why a workshop that explicitly focuses on <strong>resource mapping, pooling and match-making</strong> could be the action based format we\u2019re looking for.\n\nAs the call to action for the workshop, we\u2019re considering \u2018<strong>what\u2019s your project\u2019s pain?</strong>\u2019 because we want to make it clear that beyond meeting up and socialising, the goal of the workshop is to come up with needs-based workable solutions.\n\n<strong>What do you think?</strong>\n\nThis is a starting point to build on - looking for your input too!

All of the members of our global collective want to see that happen. </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>The FairCoop Thessaloniki is a local group linked to the global movement. We\u2019re all dealing in different ways with the establishment of tools and processes that would bring about alternative, cooperative economies. </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>In the case of our city, to some extent, it\u2019s done by implementation of alternative cryptocurrency, faircoin, developed by the FairCoop. We try to understand ways in which this currency, and a local currency introduced after the crisis, can coexist and supplement each other. In any case, the goal is to free ourselves from proprietary technologies and capitalist banking systems - by creating a parallel circular model, ideally connecting and supporting a whole ecosystem of projects locally and globally. </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>There is also the ambition to create a health care system within the communities by implementing the same solutions and building autonomous, community managed and driven scheme, highly independent from the existing one. For example, it could be done by using the percentage of community\u2019s income to fund health care. It could even in the future take shape of an autonomous security system. Considering the increasingly ubiquitous 3D technology, many of the medical tools can be soon printed cheaply by anyone. Small ethical pharmaceuticals will be able to produce their own medicine. And all the wealth that is sucked up from the communities will stay there, making them stronger and independent. It is already the case in Spain, where after 6 years of experiments in the communities of all kinds a lot of generated income has been fed back and used to build, support projects, create systems of all kinds. </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>We also plan to replace the public system with a cooperative one. For now, it\u2019s a hurdle - but in the future, it will be possible. The condition? The strong community behind it. </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>FairCoop exists since 2 years, and in Thessaloniki, it started a few months ago. We have links with dozens of cooperatives, organizations, initiatives and communities - such as Bitcoin community, P2P foundation, Catalonia Cooperative, etc. We\u2019ve brought on board more than 1000 people so far. Yet, there\u2019s still a lot to be done. We need to connect and build stronger alliances even in the cities - in Thessaloniki, many existing initiatives remain disconnected from each other. We need to develop models of integral cooperation on different levels. Bring decentralized technologies to local communities to make them more resilient. And seed the idea of cooperation, which will replace competition. </span>\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-12 16:26:33", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 04:52:40.331255", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 848, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 35.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14233, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1639, "post_number": 3, "raw": "It's all good Arthur.

Enrico from WeMake has brought support and enthusiasm in printing assistive prototypes like the one you see in the above picture.\n\nNow, we are collaborating online (Google Calendar and Google Docs mostly) and offline, meeting quite often at WeMake to design and deliver a local project with common goals....more to come :)\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/1/11b18ce0e7c5f041d4de559873588ee8a046f08f.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"367\">\n\nIs interesting to remark that we are -more or less- following the trajectory represented in the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZCQL-PmMKQ7pX6Kqj1JTI0mGZGZHt_1tI7VyrOIU_30/present#slide=id.p\">matrix</a> developed during the meeting in Geneva, with the different steps going from 1A to 6F.", "created_at": "2017-06-07 14:35:21", "updated_at": "2018-05-21 16:18:50.479532", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 425, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 63.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4934], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1840, "user_id": 81, "topic_id": 1807, "post_number": 1, "raw": "The first thing that keeps on stirring in my mind is this: you want to be as big as email? You want to change the model of Economy?\n\nWell then start building on what you have so far, do all it takes to protect it and don't take anything for granted.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Do not forget you're amazing</strong>: this is not about a scrappy start-up. The Economy App is THE winner of the EU Social Innovation Prize. This is really appealing. Play on it, use the contacts, keep the momentum and use whatever you can to get the best outcomes from the negotiation procedure with the hosting commnuity (whether it be Matera and/or another city or an online barter community).</li>\n\n<li><strong>Do not take anything for granted</strong>: you might be used to the Economy App because you're plunged in it for quite some time, but most people have never heard of it and in their eyes it's THE winner of the EU prize, and the first algorithm that figures out how to manage network barter.</li>\n\n<li><strong>You are giving the opportunity</strong> to host the first networked barter community, <strong>not the opposite</strong>: do not underestimate the appeal of this EU Prize, the interest of it being the first social prototype and the trend of social innovation. You are offering an existing platform an incredible chance to position itself in an innovative way or giving a city a great potential to solve issues linked to market exchange. Put all the chances on your side to negotiate all you need from your counterpart. Which means, first of all, figure out what you need very clearly.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Do not be scared to raise the bar of requirements</strong>, when needed: map out all the resources that are needed to seed and grow the local barter community. Another thing you do have on your side is that it's not about asking for money (although it's always welcome, to a certain extent). It's about services and human resources: that's stuff a city council can get you. Media partners, communication, service-design, visibility, recognition. It's about <strong>facilitation </strong>more than financial support.</li>\n\n<li>Bear in mind the <strong>balance between revenue and social impact</strong>: bootstrapping is the 1st step, but is it sustainable on the long run? If it's not about fundraising (in the beginning), what is the mechanism to keep it sustainable not only for you (% of the turn over in barter + \u20ac which circulate) but for those who will collaborate and commit to this?</li>\n\n<li><strong>You can choose</strong>: Matera is not the only place. It is important for negotiations: you can go in other places. Keep in mind that developing the local barter community there will determine some of the choices. Scaling, when correlated to density, will be harder in an underpopulated region: What does your coutnerpart give you to counterbalance this difficulty? Internet penetration is limited, therefore you will have to develop a mobile application: this means time, skills and resources you will have to take away from something else. So, here again, what does your counterpart have to say on this? Also, you will be creating a new mentality, but this will need effort and translation (not only language issue): you could be doing this in London or infiltrate other existing online barter networks. This is the kind of negotiation I would go through, of course in order to get what you need. <strong>So, what do you need? </strong></li>\n\n<li>Network bartering is (also) about <strong>community sustainability</strong>: can you <strong>demonstrate the need</strong>? All innovations are disruptive in the value chain, but not all are capable of pinpointing whos toes the innovation will be trading on. These toes will be different depending on where you will seed the community: do you have a good vision of the local user community? If not, what do you need (in terms of community development and management) and what are the ways to understand from now potential end users?</li>\n\n<li><strong>Social prototyping is about impact assessment: </strong>do not be scared to change your strategy in function of what the data tells you.<strong> \"Fail faster, succeed sooner\"</strong>: do not underestimate the importance of benchmarking and reporting. What tools are needed? What is the time sequence you are giving yourself? What are your objectives?</li>\n\n<li><strong>Community development is one of the steps of the growth strategy</strong>, not the final objective: what comes before, what comes after?</li>\n\n<li>Who are your <strong>allies</strong>? Whith whom will you want to build a <strong>coalition</strong>? On what terms? Matera2019? Volunteers?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nSo here comes the time sequence, IF this is going to happen in Matera (as I said, I really wouldn't take stuff for granted: this is about making the Economy App work)\n\n\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><u>From now until end September</u>: CALL + NEGOTIATION + COLLABORATION FRAMEWORK. Work on the call as if nothing else existed : the Winner of the EUSocInn Prize Economy App is searching for a community to be embedded in. It's not about money, it's about finding the most fertile land possible to plant the seed and grow it. What do you need?</li>\n\n<li><u>October</u>: service-design, communication strategy, team building</li>\n\n<li><u>November-December</u>: soft launch</li>\n\n<li><u>January</u>: build on significance of subscribing during January (all the people who do it get something). They arrive on the platform and the softlaunch will already have created some traffic.</li>\n\n<li><u>February - July</u>: social prototyping</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<u>What expertise is needed to manage the innovation? The heavy way...</u>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>3 developers</li>\n\n<li>1 service-designer</li>\n\n<li>1 communication &amp; marketing expert</li>\n\n<li>1 translator</li>\n\n<li>1 community development</li>\n\n<li>2 community managers</li>\n\n<li>1 accountant</li>\n\n<li>1 fundraiser</li>\n\n<li>volunteers</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nOne could start testing Matera in the following ways:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>post a mission on the community and push through SM to get answers to question on what community could best be the end-user of the Economy app: what is the need?</li>\n\n<li>Facebook can be another good way of asking the question (if this is done by someone with a good reputation)</li>\n\n<li>Letter written to Committee: this is not about the unMonastery, this is about the Economy App. It has, in my view, a different procedure.</li>\n\n<li>The community mt2019 has already 200 users. They could be the first to test the Economy App: but I find this premature, and I don't believe that there is a strong need (organizing events, yes but...)</li>\n\n<li>Allies such as Angelo Tosto (the Berlusconi guy that owns both football and local TV)</li>\n\n<li>Think about small companies</li>\n\n<li>Old people which could get some care by swapping what they don't need anymore.

Mind you, not a normal one. It's myself, the author and -hopefully- the readers. That's all. Nothing else. No infrastructure, no distributors, no nothing. Setting upt the website, by the way, hope I can update this with a URL soon enough :D.\n\nUntil recently I've been working with a publishing project (<a href=\"http://editorialtria.com/\">http://editorialtria.com</a>) that used several ways to improve the usual backward feeling in the publishing sector in Spain, such as PoD books (thus, no stock to take care of), direct sales (thus, no distributors that bleed away most of the cover price for themselves), and a supposedly great deal for the authors (that is, a higher royalties rate than usual in the Spanish market).\n\nSounds good, right? Well, it is a nice project in general, but I have several issues with the way things are done inside and formally, so I decided enough was enough and quit. The next day I was already planning on how to do something that I felt comfortable with. Thus was Knitting Guns Press born.\u00a0\n\nThe name is not only a provocation, no matter what people think (and if they think that, and they talk about it, brilliant). I do sincerely believe that, in this day and age, words are powerful weapons, the ones that inspire minds and make creativity emerge in people. The knitting part is related to the creation process. Yes, knitting can be fun (been there), but it is a laborious process, and a minefield of frustration for someone (like me) who is basically an all-thumber. Publishing a book, by comparison, is just a highway to instant success... not. Same there. So, knitting it was.\n\nThe Knitting Guns Press project has a few basic concepts that will be applied:\n\n1. CC - copyleft contents\n\nIf you buy a book from Knitting Guns Press, it's yours. Thus, the content needs to be useable by you, however you see fit. All authors know, and so far have accepted, that their content in the e-books we'll be publishing can and will be reused, redistributed and shared. This, aside from being a 180\u00ba turn from the usual publishing take on the issue, is based on a fundamental idea: we do not take, nor will we treat, readers (please substitute for customers or consumers as needed) for crooks. Any use you can make of what we publish, short of re-selling it (project sustainability and all that jazz) will make us happy.\n\n\u00a0\n\n2. All books will be digital. No dead trees.\u00a0\n\nThis means, I won't \u00a0publish your book on a nice, softcover edition that you can sign. Why? Well, reach for starters. My take on the publishing industry is that, when you go the atoms way, several creepy humans who happen to have so-called \"logistics\" appear and demand 40% of the cover price to move your books around. I'm very sorry for bookshops, but that's an extorsion I won't be part of. Obviously, the book will be available (from the website, from ibooks, from amazon, you name it), but no, there is no way of getting a printed book unless you DIY.\n\n\u00a0\n\n3. All authors are those left out by the system.\n\nYes, no Dan Brown, no Carlos Ruiz Zaf\u00f3n. That doesn't mean we won't publish best-sellers (as if that depended on the publisher, ever), it means that if you have an idea and we like it (a fundamental element for me to be able to work on the book), we'll publish it. We don't care about an author's name, we care about the text itself.\n\n\u00a0\n\n4. No book over 5 Euro\n\nWell, as we are doing e-book, and under CC on top of that, it would be idiotic to try and get 15 Euro per sale. Unless selling is not the idea, as those prices are usually the best way of getting a nice, round zero on yearly results. Books are meant to be read, not luxury items. Thus, yeah, dirt cheap, as much as we can.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n5. 50/50 income deal\n\nAs an author, you have put a lot of effort in your work. As an editor, so have I. If we understand the creation of a book as a partnership (and it is, or something is very wrong with the ways things are going), we'll split the profits from each book with its author.\u00a0\n\nThese are the five pillars (and no, there is no Islam connection here, it's just that 3 is too small and more are difficult to remember in the mayhem of day-to-day life), and this is the project. I hope I'll be able to update it with good news veeeery soon.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-07 17:25:45", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 09:20:53.071609", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 915, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2572, "user_id": 1938, "topic_id": 2539, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<span>A couple of months ago a number weird stencils started to appear in the streets of <span>Tbilisi and other cities of Georgian </span>making <span>gender discriminative and quite stereotypical statements including \u201cWomen should not be in politics\u201d, \u201cGirls don\u2019t need higher education\u201d, \u201cOnly men should provide for family\u201d, \u201cWoman is not a leader\u201d, etc.</span></span>\n\n<span>From the very beginning it became apparent that it was not some dubious group of chauvinists spreading their hatred through wall or street art. It was apparently a kind of a campaign promoting gender equality, but was the message clear enough?</span>\n\nBefore discussing the given campaign further, I would like to describe the attitude of Georgian society towards gender equality in a nutshell. G<span>eorgian society has been strictly patriarchal across the ages, although the situation is in the process of advancing in terms of gender equality. Number of reliable researches shows the persistence of gender inequality in Georgia, including alarmingly low prevalence of women in politics and violence against women (1 out of every 11 women has been a victim of verbal/physical abuse from his husband/partner), which to me sounds pretty dramatic.</span>\n\nI don\u2019t intend to write a lot about facts and figures from different sophisticated sources; I want to bring an example from my friend\u2019s personal experience, which displays that yes, gender inequality is still here and yes, people still suffer from so \u2013called \u201cproblem unawareness\u201d.<span> A friend of mine is a 25 year old Georgian female and at the age of 18 she was kidnapped. In case if you have not heard of it, Georgia was and at some point still is the society where the concept of \u201cbridenapping\u201d is accepted and practiced by certain social groups. She was \u201cbridenapped\u201d by a young man of her age, claiming to be deeply in love, who intended to force her to marry him. To cut a long story short, thanks to responsiveness of girl\u2019s parents and her personal capacity to endure the toughest 2 days of her life full of threatening and brainwashing, she survived. Her folks found her in a god-abandoned village in western part of Georgia and brought her home safe and sound. As for the kidnapper and his accomplices, who committed a criminal act, they also returned home with scars on their souls, tortured by the evil witch, who could not appreciate the act of true love. Yes, that\u2019s it. End of Story! No one went to police, no one was punished, no one paid for what they had done; except for the girl of course, as she could not sleep for months and developed disturbing claustrophobia, which she still has, by the way.</span>\n\n<span>Back in my parent\u2019s student times bridenapping was almost an everyday case. You know what happened next? <span>The girls\u2019 parents denied their daughters of coming back home, as they most probably were not virgins anymore; girls had literally nowhere to go \u2013 unfinished college education, no sources of income, no place to stay, no friends or relatives standing by their side. And they got married to the criminals, they lived with the people they did not love, raised their children, washed their dirty laundry, cooked their meals and watched husbands cheat on them because, still, they had nowhere to go. And society thought and still thinks that it was right, people cannot be punished for committing \u201cacts of love\u201d, man does not deserve to go to prison just because he wanted to marry a woman he was in love with; even women used to agree with this statement, they still d</span>o.</span>\n\n<span>Bridenapping is not a frequent case now, but in regions and scarcely even in big cities, it still exists and the attitude has not changed significantly. Maybe women are not being kidnapped and enslaved by men anymore but according to United Nations Population Fund in Georgia 65% of males and 53% of females agrees to the statement that \u201cwomen should tolerate verbal (with lower percentage on physical) abuse by her husband, in order to maintain the family integrity\u201d. And the saddest part is that it\u2019s the women themselves, who make this legit.</span>\n\n<span>Getting back to stencils \u2013 after a little while the stencils were painted over with a phrase \u201ccrash the stereotype\u201d. Soon it was revealed that the campaign was initiated by UNDP Georgia and implemented by the movement \u201cChange Your Opinion\u201d, aiming to alter the societal attitudes and opinions linked to the gender specific distribution of roles and responsibilities</span>.<span> Their work did not end at the point of repainting the stencils</span>. <span>A number of women empowerment events were held in the country shortly afterwards, including paint bombing of gender stereotypes, open discussions on gender topics, youth conferences, gender equality awards, photo exhibitions, et</span>c.

The hackathon group to help setup the space on the 20th (Alberto confirmed for this, Dorotea perhaps).\n\nPeople are coming that we don\u2019t know. How to make sure they are accounted for? Invent a way for people to come onboard at the last minute without breaking the social contract. A part of it needs to be that people let us know they are coming with a 2-click procedure, then we give them something to do once they are here. At that point it is realistic to say \u201cif you are not on this list, you are not coming\u201d). We also need to account for the local people in Matera, who are telling each other they will come but are NOT signing up. Maybe we could ask someone from Matera to coordinate on this, come up with a number of people from Matera who will be coming, and hopefully a list. Maybe a week ahead of time close signup.\u00a0\n\nNeed to be in contact with Natalia if you want to stay at unMon during Lote4\n\nHow to organize kitchen and meals?\n\nKatalin: it\u2019s not really unMonastery Lite, it\u2019s unMonastery guests; she\u2019d like it to be a place hosting those who arrive late or don\u2019t have accommodation; cooking frugal dinners (\u201cnomadic dinners\u201d). Important: all these initiatives need to be on the platform somewhere.\n\nSomething to do for people who come: Garbage Teams. Garbage is very visible, and needs to be disposed of several times a day during a conference.

Here we need to make a decision on whether the unconference part is one day or split in time slots across all days. Bembo wants to be involved: but everybody will be, as the framework will start as a stub and be plenty negotiable.\n\n<strong>Everyone</strong>: Good idea to go to a few session proposals and leave some comments, give presenters/hosts feedback and support.\n\n<strong>Bembo</strong> to write a guide to LOTE discipline. Making sure that people are aware of cultural differences and respect them.\n\n<strong>Actionable</strong> (unassigned): create briefs for curators once a first version of the program is up (what is expected of them); pair seniors with an Edgeryder - curation would mean thinking ahead and pinging session leaders to talk about key things. Who does this?\n\n<strong>Katalin + unMonasterians</strong> to write a detailed plan for staying at the house. Start by getting in touch with Natalia and put up a list of people to be hosted there? 4-5 unMonks (Katalin, Kei, Ben, Bembo, Maria, Lucia, Emanuele) + hackathon group (Leo, Remi, Marc) + others participating, potentially leaving room for late arrivers;\n\n! The issue of who stays there is important, many people are looking to book in Matera or have limited resources, better to know this ahead.\n\n<strong>Dorotea</strong> to get in touch with list of Berlin crew coming to Lote4 &amp; practical arrangements\n\n<strong>Nicola</strong> to open a session on the very politically hot problem of oil extraction in Basilicata.

With 75000 inhabitants the City,\u00a0together with Galway County and the Islands, is currently shortlisted for becoming <a href=\"http://galway2020.ie/en\">European Capital of Culture (ECoC) in 2020</a>.\n\nStarting this March, we are joyful and excited\u00a0to kickstart a\u00a0collaboration between the Edgeryders organisation and Galway City Council\u00a0leading the Galway 2020 bid. Our mission is to support the team by working\u00a0with\u00a0local groups\u00a0to identify <strong>citizen led initiatives\u00a0in civic,\u00a0social,\u00a0tech innovation and areas in between</strong>; help\u00a0projects\u00a0make it into the bidbook before June 2016;\u00a0and infuse them with deep European/\u00a0global thinking.\n\n<strong>What it means </strong>\n\nIf you participated at Living on the Edge in Brussels last week, you may have met Niall O'Hara (<a href=\"/u/nialloh\">@NiallOH</a>)\u00a0and <a href=\"/u/thom_stewart\">Thom Stewart</a> in our session about <a href=\"/t/unfailing-european-capitals-of-culture-into-platforms-for-citizens-initiatives/5074\">ECoCs</a>. They made a case for opening\u00a0up the city's bid to the many interested citizens and groups that risk falling off the radar during such large scale, programmatic cultural planning. A lot of <a href=\"http://galway2020.ie/en/visions/\">great ideas</a> get lost and don\u2019t make it into the bidbook because there are no consistent feedback loops to support them evolve\u00a0into full fledged, well planned\u00a0projects with capacity to deliver.\n\nEdgeryders is a good ally in this situation because we speak the language of skilled communities: we like to go to the very isolated places where radical innovation is born. We don't ask about organisations and paper partnerships, we want to shake hands with the people in the trenches and work together in open, cheap, effective ways. What we bring is an outlet that is bigger than the sum of individuals and projects - the Edgeryders network (digital and physical). Being a connected node in this environment lowers the costs of forging\u00a0collaborations\u00a0and makes it easier for ideas to find good matches and kindred spirits across the border. Having worked in Matera, Tbilisi, Cairo, Bucharest etc, it appears that\u00a0change makers on the ground have much more in common with each other than with their respective local establishments. We learn a great deal <em>together</em>. For the cities that fund collaboration, the added value is fulfilling two important conditions in the ECoC grid: (1) projects be participatory and engaging many\u00a0citizens\u00a0and (2) projects be European e.g. in conception and scale. This and the possibility of\u00a0winning helps\u00a0raise the profile of their city.\n\n<strong>What are we going to do over the next three months and how you can get involved</strong>\n\nHow this will play out is that myself and @Alberto will each be spending a few weeks in Galway to meet people with ideas and projects in the region that can grow into solid collaborations across the borders. It is hard to say now what those\u00a0will be, but essentially we\u2019re on the lookout for cases where\u00a0citizens\u00a0take the lead in making innovation for the common good - whether it's solutions to social challenges, pieces of new cultural infrastructure, novel methodologies and uses of data and technology, or intersections between these (did you know that\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/know-the-code-the-rise-and-rise-of-the-coderdojo-movement-1.1774135\">CoderDojo</a> is Ireland\u00a0born?!). Once we find them, we will help\u00a0frame them in programme language and structure, show\u00a0compatibility with the bid concept and themes, and offer a credible delivery model\u00a0with\u00a0European partners and scale.\n\nWe will be blogging and calling for help all the way!

I am 25 years old, I have studied Business Administration and Management and I have a Masters in International Advertising. I consider myself as a huge fan of social media and I am passionate about young entrepreneurship and innovation. At the moment I am having an internship at Hub Vienna and my main responsibilities are on communication, social media and hosting.\n\nThis is how I got to know Edgeryders and got involved as an engagement manager, connecting with the community and spreading the word. When Alberto contacted me and talked to me about this platform I thought that it is a very big opportunity of sharing ideas and opinions around youth problems and thoughts. I come from Greece and I am a \"professional immigrant\" in Austria because my country couldn't provide me a healthy start up in my \"adult life\".\n\nI know from inside what it means having transition problems from student life to the professional one. We face problems in political life, in getting into professional life, in fulfilling our dreams... I have the impression that everything in my country is falling apart and I have to do something about it, if us, the new generation, give up then we are almost lost. I keep saying to myself that the only way to make a change is to take action!\n\nI am happy that through Edgeryders I can contribute by communicating all of my thoughts and supporting others and also exchange ideas and learn more about youth policy and peer-to-peer communication. My expectations from this platform is to see many young people from different countries engaged and connected. I would like to see more Greek people taking part because I believe that they have a lot to share and take back from the platform and the community of Edgeryders. At the end of the day, we all come through the same challenges and insecurities and if we want to make a change in our future we need to collaborate on this.\n\nWhat I like the most about Edgeryders is that it covers a big range of interesting topics. For now I am very interested in this campaign \"<a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/campaign/making-living\">Making a Living</a>\". Just today I was reading the <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/making-living/spotlight-social-innovation\">mission brief on social innovation</a> and I was impressed on how some young people deal with finding work: by creating work themselves. So, let's connect and make a change ;) You can read <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/share-your-ryde/mission_case/looking-new-different-unexpected\">my transition story</a> and if you're not an Edgeryder yet <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/user/register\">sign up here</a> and do get in touch by writing on <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/users/charaoikonomidou\">my profile</a>!\n\n", "created_at": "2012-02-20 11:54:51", "updated_at": "2017-11-13 16:41:06.117613", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 561, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 50.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1481, "user_id": 127, "topic_id": 1448, "post_number": 1, "raw": "It's very hard to do this without feeling vaguely like I'm rolling up a Dungeons &amp; Dragons character. I know, my geek is showing. But here goes.\n\n<u><strong>Historian</strong></u>\n\nI don't think I need to state further that the past has always fascinated me. I have spent literally half of my life learning about and sharing my knowledge of the past. It is, to me, of vital importance that we understand where we came from.\n\nI have acquired these skills through both formal and informal means. I have completed a BA and an MA, both slanted towards History. I have also read, researched, and explored on my own initiative. Furthermore, as a curator and antiquarian, I place a huge emphasis on physical objects that are connected to the past.\n\nSince I have made my living in the museums and heritage world, my knowledge of History has done me a great service. It is only very recently that I have begun to explore the potential non-academic applications to my historical knowlege. Time will tell.\n\n<u><strong>Swordsman</strong></u>\n\nThis, I can fully admit, was a childhood fantasy that, somehow, I managed to pursue into my later years and even get paid for. My good friend Vinay Gupta is very fond of highlighting the hilarious fact that someone who had their beginnings as a 'sword carnie' managed to attain a curatorship at the Tower of London taking care of Henry VIII's armour. And yes, this is pretty much what happened.\n\nI began training in swordplay at 15. Given that, in the Middle Ages, this training would have begun between 12 and 14, I'm not too far off the mark for keeping up with squires from that period (minus, you know, horsemanship and actual combat experience). I was part of a stage combat troupe that did fight shows for the Renaissance Festival circuit around New England (for those not familiar with this peculiarly American phenomenon, imagine an historical re-enactment event combined with an element of interactive theatre and a slightly more... liberal approach to historical accuracy).\u00a0 Through this I slowly met up with people who were studying and practicing 'Western Martial Arts' through the use of the few surviving early European manuals of combat that have survived. This ultimately became my main area of research, and I am proud to be a recognised name amongst a very small number of individuals in the world engaging in this field.\n\nIt is more than just a martial art for me. It is, in the Eastern sense, a 'Way'. I have applied swordplay and the study of arms/war into a greater philosophy, much as many previous strategists and masters-of-arms have done before me. It has taught me the importance of observation and <em>appropriate</em> reaction.\n\n<u><strong>Singer</strong></u>\n\nAs I mentioned above, I started off as a performer. I have always loved to sing and have enjoyed being on stage and in front of an audience. I have been performing since I was about 5 and, although I don't 'tread the boards' nowadays as often as I once did, it is something that has never fully left my life.\n\nI have in recent years focussed primarily on folk music. If I do say so myself, I am quite good. One of the most empowering experiences for me is when, standing before a crowd and beginning a song, I slowly perceive the normal bustle begin to die away until, by the time I finish, you can literally hear a pin drop. That is how I know I have done well. That something like a song has the power to affect people that way is something that I find fascinating. Whatever it is, it is old and powerful. And, as you can imagine, such a knack has come in quite useful in a field where giving talks and tours is expected.\n\nAlthough I am primarily considered a scholar nowadays, there is more than a little of the bard still in me.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-03-26 16:30:17", "updated_at": "2018-06-03 05:55:36.555119", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 711, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 60.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25518, "user_id": 1442, "topic_id": 5437, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>when was agreed?</b>\n\nunfortunately\u00a0i'll never be able to participate\u00a0because I have a similar call for another project on the same day of the week at same time :(\n\nwhen did the decision take place\u00a0and in which thread?

I think it would make sense to work out the differences to old fashioned canning - which is probably a likely alternative in most cases. I have to look a little more closely at the energy before I can comment on that critical bit though. In general I guess it'll work for you that you don't produce a lot of excess heat that isn't terribly useful anyways around harvest time (this applies more to berries than to meat of course).\n\nOne doubt I have is why invest into 1000 W of electrical PV power so you can convert it back to thermal (when the sun is shining)? Why not use a solar thermal method with (or without) pumped down pressure? If you <em>already have</em> the PV this does sound like a nice way to store some work in the form of prepared food.\n\nTechnically a concern would be clogging &amp; hygiene of the low pressure system with vegetable &amp; meat juices in them if the cold trap is not perfect.\n\nA smaller issue would be if you can trust the compressor to run continuously at relatively high power. <s>(Those units typically get rather warm - perhaps add a heat pipe into the vac chamber and couple\u00a0 the food plate(stack) via an oil interface?</s> &lt;- Probably not a good idea as most heat pipes use metal and that would not play well with your microwave - at least it could end up conducting the heat out into the compressor. Bad idea. Ceramic may work, but more likely will break).\n\nOne more point with heating vs drying is that heating deals with bacteria better I believe. This could be important when you are dumpster diving and this or that bit already has started to rot.\n\nFrom a barter perspective drying is really good of course because you usually save 50% of product weight by not carrying water, and you probably can package much lighter, perhaps ending up with a end weight of 1/3 - 1/4 compared to canning.

if so, please post them below and we can, y'know, share.\n\n<strong>open-source tools have been around for a long time now. </strong>i remember early shareware and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeware\">freeware</a> from a couple of decades ago - it was pretty cool at the time to think that there were people out there, on the early internet, who were making things that were genuinely useful (and sometimes just fun!) and then giving them away for free. open source software is completely different - it's much better, both because it's genuinely 'free' (as in 'freedom', rather than just 'no cost'), and also because giving access to the source code means many people can improve it, which wasn't possible with freeware. it's not just 'free stuff' - it's a genuinely new way of doing things.\n\nwe all use programs like firefox, openoffice and the like as part of our everyday lives, but <strong>until recently i didn't hold out much hope for open-source filmmaking</strong>. i'd tried a few programs but they were pretty basic and, apart from occasional incorporation, i couldn't really use them for paid work - they just weren't powerful enough. the reason is simply that a lot of the most successful open-source programs (firefox is a case in point) were created when companies went down and released their code for free online, usually in the hope that they might still hurt their rivals, from beyone the corporate grave. film programs are so massive, so powerful and dominated by so few players, that it seemed impossible that it would happen there (by 'film programs', i'm talking about non-linear editors, 3D modelling packages, image manipulation, that sort of thing). all of that's changed over the past few years and, fingers crossed, it's going to get a lot better soon too.\n\n<strong>here's a list of really awesome film-related programs to check out</strong>, if you don't know about them already:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.blender.org/\">blender</a> is an <strong>open-source 3D modelling package</strong>. it's incredibly powerful, and at the time of writing, is on a par with the big, paid-for programs. this is massive news. all of the big programs are different, and each, including blender, has its area of specialism, but the others (like maya, 3DSMax etc) cost thousands of pounds/euros to use commercially, whilst blender is absolutely free! blender was created when a big 3D suite's owner went bankrupt and the dutch government bought the code, got some really amazing people to do some work on it, and then released it to the world.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.gimp.org/\">the gimp</a> is a <strong>photo manipulation package</strong> - like photoshop, except more awesome. as well as typical photo manipulating, the gimp has a lot of animation features - i once used it to create an animated music video, which was a commercially-funded project, and only used paid software to assemble the video file at the end.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.lightworksbeta.com/\">lightworks</a> is a <strong>non-linear video editor</strong>. now, this is the big one, in my view, and it's worth mentioning with some trepidation, because it doesn't quite fit into the same mould as the programs mentioned above. but if things pan out it <em>could</em> be really awesome.<em> </em>lightworks<em> isn't open source</em>, but should be very soon. basically, other NLE programs like avid and premiere have gone from being high-end, industry-only suites to relatively mass-use programs because the amount of people who now have access to filmmaking equipment has hugely expanded. lightworks is old-school - it's used in big hollywood facilities to make features that you watch on cinema screens. that places it in a possibly weak position, because if nothing changed, it would never have the user base of other programs, and might die out. the program's owners' solution is quite innovative for their industry: release the source code under an open license, and make money by charging for really specific services that most video editors just won't need, but which production companies will. these are all things that the program's owners have to pay to incorporate into lightworks also, so it doesn't seem unfair. and they're planning to charge very little for even that, especially considering that their rivals' software can cost many thousands of pounds/euros. we have to hold our breath though - they've promised to release the code, but haven't done so quite yet (though you can download and use it for free already!) - the final proof will be when the code's out there.\n\n<strong>anyway:</strong> i hope somebody reads the above, and finds a program that they didn't know about, because i think they're all amazing. <strong>if they're all new to you</strong>, though, i'd say one thing: you'll have to put in a bit of effort to migrate to them from whatever you use at the moment, but it'll be worth it. moving from final cut to lightworks is no harder than moving from final cut to premiere, for example, but the reward is much greater because you've just saved yourself a grand or two, and much, much more in the cost of upgrades over future years. as well, of course, as the awesome feeling from knowing you've made the switch from an old way of working to a new, radical ecology.<strong> these programs are complex and powerful</strong> and, just like their non-free counterparts, take a lot of learning, experimenting and getting used to. if you need inspiration along the way, check out some of the things people have made using them - there are some pretty impressive <a href=\"http://orange.blender.org/download\">short films</a> on blender's site, for example.\n\ni hope some of that's useful and, whether it is or not, <strong>post any similar projects you know about below</strong>, so everyone can benefit (including me!)\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-05 18:20:20", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 10:59:45.997369", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1104, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32225, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5879, "post_number": 25, "raw": "<b>Apologies everyone</b>\n\nMy flight into Brussels\u00a0was delayed.

My impression is that it was percieved as credible, engaging and clear as 1) the CEO of Ericsson in SA validated the process even mentioning a case study of their investment into mobile phones 2) A CEO of another company asked me how they would build this for their organisation and clients \u00a03) The\u00a0Director of operations for Mistra\u00a0approached me and booked a meeting to take place tomorrow to explore how we might work together.\n\nKey: Solid\u00a0information and facilitation in an environment of trust- The presentation took place in a private lunch held at the\u00a0Swedish Ambassador's residence and\u00a0the Ambassador briefed me well about the perspective, priorities and percieved difficulties of the CEOs in the room ahead of the meeting. During the lunch he ensured everyone introduced themselves to one another, and then introduced the two participants the Director of Mistra and myself and how he thought our work was relevant to the other participants. After the presentation I got a lot of feedback from the rest of the Embassy staff and they made me aware of the dynamics in the room of which I was not aware. In this case they were positive, but note to self: important to get better at reading rooms and subtle signals- how to learn?\n\nFollow up: <span>In order to be able to deliver what generates revenue, we have to take into account the cost of maintaining the social and technical platform that keeps the community going and thriving.

And make it clear that developing a solid project proposal is a participatory process that requires those who wish to access the benefits to share the costs of making happen (they pay us\u00a0a retainer/ for set deliverables/ to sponsor an unMonastery). Does\u00a0the\u00a0entry-point\u00a0offer need to be different for the corporates and for the foundations/think tanks?

I was already involved in the <a href=\"/t/the-edgeryders-guide-to-the-baltic/781\">Baltic Edge project</a> some time ago, in early 2013, then some other projects took over, and finally I was able to be back to the community and offer my time to work for a few months. It was in a way a completely fresh start, requiring doing some reading, meeting people online, participating in discussions, and eventually getting involved with community management tasks.\n\nThese few weeks in Matera were magic - full of interesting encounters with people dealing with arts, programming, social work, running tiny shops in the caves, working at the University, making the ECC 2019 bid do its magic in the competition, and so on, and so forth. If I ever thought of solitude and slow, independent work on organising this event from the empty at that time space of unMonastery, I couldn't be more wrong. It took me two days to meet dozens of people and get wired into Matera's vibrant life. Language knowledge helped a lot - even though my Italian is far from perfection, it allowed me to handle a conversation and coordinate organisation of the event. In the south of Italy that seems to be one of the essential skills - people love to talk and interact, and it helps a great deal to be able to participate in their social life.\n\nFrom my side, the organisation involved social media and communication presence; helping with great part of the logistics, such as transportation, distribution of grants, communication with the participants, sometimes helping with their travels arrangements and searching for available beds in town. I prepared the tickets, kept track of who contributed to the event organisation (and also prepared together with the rest of the team the list of tasks, which completion was rewarded with the tickets and travel grants), helped organising VIP's arrangements, and so on.\n\nBesides, I also took part in curating the program and providing space to sessions, keeping track of the scheduled sessions, merging them in some cases, and so on.\n\nMoreover, with help of wonderful people, we arranged all the logistics for the event on the spot - such as fantastic Italian catering, with tons of great food every day both brought from local producers, but also preparing the shopping (or sometimes doing it myself) and making sure that all the ingredients for the event are there when needed. What was important is that we managed to prepare a special kitchen and cleaning schedule. Besides all the meetings and a great program, it was one of the top aspects of the event: kitchen full of people who escaped for a moment the intellectual debates and decided to take on the simple daily tasks - which were not always so simple, and quite often provided with enormous amounts of joy and satisfaction. The kitchen was the heart of the event. I also made sure there will be enough chairs, beds, toilet papers, projectors and other utensils necessary to facilitate an event.\n\nFinally there was a lot of hard work of community engagement and outreach, maybe not the most succesfull aspect of my work - but that was forgiven, as many people even though they promised to come, never showed up. Part of the local climate, where plans change in a blink, depending on the weather and what else is happening in the city at the moment. Nevertheless, I managed to create some space of interaction between some of the Materani involved in social and cultural work and the edgeryders/unMonasterians. And that required weeks of making friends and convincing them it would make sense. Not sure if it it bore the fruits (or ever will), it was still worth trying.\n\nSo, as LOTE5 is coming sometime in the second part of the year, Edgeryders will be looking now for a person who'd like to do some of this magic this time - still a lot remains unknown about where, when and how the event would look like, but that is always part of the work with this community. Good to be prepared for some hard work, a lot of creative and independent spirit, energy and enthusiasm to meet the wonderful nomads in the real life somewhere around Europe. What I can tell, is that I have learnt a lot doing it the last time, and it was a fabulous experience.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-04-23 18:19:20", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:24.475569", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 798, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18078, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5782, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Yes please!</b>\n\nPlease, do that.

Mind if I think out loud then summarise?</b>\n\nOk, so - worst case scenarios. I come from the flubie world: folks who were alerted by the World Health Organisation and more directly by a bunch of bloggers who wrote from a deep knowledge of epidemics and also from a condition of anonymity, which allowed them to truly speak their minds when those in official positions couldn't. I'm thinking about the revere(s), one or more bloggers under one pen name, expert(s) in some aspects related to flu science, who wrote extensively about flu preparedness. A small but ilustrative sample - oddly appropriate to our subject, given that I just googled for \"revere pandemic flu\" - is here: http://scienceblogs.com/effectmeasure/2007/07/25/pandemic-flu-preparation-small/\n\nGathering some good concepts from that era, I think of a few, and I can then expand: \"staff and stuff\", \"three family tribes\", \"citizen manual\", \"supply chain fragility\", \"the role of the county\", \"discovering real needs\" ... and maybe a few other concepts.\n\nSorry if this gets messy - unpacking long-time-packed concepts here - but then I can summarise and we can think more clearly about where we go next. Thanks!\n\n---\n\n<strong>\"Staff and stuff\"</strong> is what it says. In a crisis, for health care, you need to have people who can treat patients, and those people (health-care workers or family members or patients themselves, collectively called \"staff\") need devices and supplies (a machine to analyse sugar in the blood, and also the reactants). In a bad pandemic flu scenario, both might be missing: healthcare workers may be \"hit\" (ill or taking care of their own families or frightened to go out), and supplies might be stuck somewhere along the supply chain because the truck drivers are \"hit\" too. (These problems go from 0% to 100% depending on the severity of the pandemic. At a certain point there are systemic effects added on: I could go to work but the bus driver is \"hit\", therefore I'm \"secondarily hit\".)\n\nNow, what happens in a financial collapse (aka collapsonomics) scenario?\n\n- Buildings and devices stay. Lack of maintenance is an issue later, not at the beginning. (Repairing needs supplies so it's a supply issue, see later.)\n\n- People (and their knowledge of science and each other) stay, at least at the beginning and in most instances. Some doctors (health-care workers in general, let's talk about docs-etc) may flee to find jobs outside the country, but it's not as if there are many jobs in those other countries, and language is an issue for many. If there's no way to pay the docs-etc, we have a problem. Maybe we can just go back to mutuality: we feed the doc-etc, they treat our injuries-etc, we're all better off.\n\n- Supplies are the hardest issue here, because lack of money may mean stocks are not replenished. It's happening in Greece, and again it's may be 0% to 100% important, depending on the severity of the situation.\n\nSome supplies are more vital than others. Diseases and injuries that kill the \"young and otherwise healthy\" - substracting many years from potential life - are a big priority. Insulin is a good example of that.\n\nSome diseases or areas are more fragile than others, and the range is wide. Insulin-dependent diabetes is rapidly deadly in the total absence of injected insulin (3 days). (It's like water to you or me. Can't do without it, period.) Lack of medication for high blood pressure may mean a certain percentage of those with high pressure will have heart or brain complications and some of them might die in the next few months. At the lower priority end, some levels of anxiety can be treated with relaxation, exercise, food and meditation, maybe even showing how medication was not even the best solution to start with.\n\nSo, the model should include numbers, right? We'd need a list of prioritary diseases, with some numbers in a spreadsheet, so that supplies are sorted in terms of their priority. I think a good start would be the list of essential medicines published by the World Health Organisation (somewhere else on this page), with data from a specific country, and some knowledge about doses-per-day etc. I did that for insulin in the Canaries, as an exercise, and if my numbers were right we'd need maybe a couple of cubic meters of storage per million people and per month. In any case, those numbers are doable.\n\nOk, I'll be back later, to add to the list of long-packed concepts. Please add your thoughts!\n\n---\n\nOk, <strong>\"three-family tribes\"</strong>. This was a concept ideated by a fellow flubie (for the UK, where many people live in houses, but I don't know if that's needed).\n\nIn a bad pandemic, you don't want flu to multiply like a wild fire - you want to slow it down. (That way, hospitals see how the severe cases are evened out over more weeks, so the same number of resources can cope better. You also buy time for other things, and maybe even reduce the total number of infected.) And one of the tools - talking bad pandemic here - is asking parents to keep kids at home for several weeks. This was explored by flubies - which, not taking into account that they are more worried about pandemic flu than most people, are also members of their own families - and the conclusion was that it was, erm, hard.\n\nSo one idea that came out was, let's form tribes. Imagine 3 families, each with mom, dad, boy and girl - in 3 houses. Maybe they could split up: 2 adults and the 6 children go to the larger house, and don't go out much. 4 adults stay in another house, go to work with facemasks, somehow buy food for the stay-at-home group.\n\nBut we're not in a pandemic! Yes, sure. The concept is, form small tribes where people take care of each other. And this scenario is _weird_ enough that we find other ideas more _normal_. (It's what's called a \"provocation\" in lateral thinking.) What would we do in an economic meltdown scenario?\n\n---\n\nI'll cut it short here.\n\n<strong>\"Citizen manual\"</strong>: http://fluwiki.info/ has a link to <span><a class=\"urllink\" href=\"http://www.fluwiki.info/uploads/Main/FluManual_revised.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"color: blue\">Influenza Pandemic Preparation and Response - A Citizen\u2019s Guide version 2.0</a></span>\n\nThe idea is a manual gives people ideas on how to be a good, safe citizen in a bad pandemic. I wonder what that would look like in a bad economic scenario. What would be in that booklet? What would we want to see? How would we get someone to write it? Would we trust the content?\n\n<strong>\"Supply chain fragility\"</strong>. We've looked at that. A tough one. Supplies - of any kind - are produced, moved, stored, used. So we can act on any of those levels: produce more locally if you can, make sure it moves, store some just in case production or movement fail, and use less (or different) if you can. Easier said than done, but that's the basic _model_.\n\n<strong>\"The role of the county\"</strong>: some \"flubies\" approached pandemic flu as a \"yoyo\" (\"you're on our own\") situation: the state will be unable to help you deal with this, take care of your family, stock up and shelter in place. Others explored the \"wowo\" (\"we're on our own\") approach: we'll work as communities and take care of each other. No community can produce their own insulin, but if the community is large enough there are doc-etc and maybe many other roles.\n\n---\n\n<strong>\"Discovering real needs\"</strong> ... this was a big one for me personally. After looking at how systems would crumble down under the weight of a \"bad enough\" pandemic, you realise you're left with _needs_. (I learned this through Vinay's SCIM framework.) A \"need\" is something that doesn't go away when the system fails. Thing is, before the system fails, needs are mostly invisible.\n\nWhen talking about bad scenarios, I'm still surprised at how stbonrly we cling to our systems. \"We _need _supermarkets, hospitals and schools to keep working.\" Wait, we're in the middle of a bad pandemic, right? What we _need_ is food flowing to mouths, health needs taken care of as best we can, and kids growing as kids and into adults.\n\nWhat I do is draw a very simple mind map. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map A very simple one, with the system that's about to break in the center. First order branches will have \"needs\": what we want that system for, in terms of what breaks when the system breaks. Second order branches will have \"substitutions\". An example would go like this:\n\nIf electricity fails at the hospital then these things fail:\n\n- machine for killing germs in surgical knives. Need is \"sterilisation\". So maybe we could boil them? Or use some chemicals? Or both? Then we set out to find someone who knows about these solutions and who can help us write a one-page document which we can distribute to hospitals.\n\n- diagnostic devices like x-ray etc. Need is \"diagnosis\". So maybe we could have solar panels for these devices alone? Or maybe we can use other ways to diagnose? What did retired doc-etc do when these devices hadn't even been invented? Is there a multiquestion tool to help us diagnose when a specific device fails?\n\n- Phones, email, etc. Need is \"communications\". Can we use walkie-talkies? Walk? Send someone with a piece of written paper?\n\n- etc.\n\nSo, <strong>what are \"real health needs\"</strong>? Could we brainstorm a list of 50-100? If we solve many of them without money, we'll be healthy without being rich.\n\nOk, done for today. Thanks!\n\n", "created_at": "2012-07-28 19:37:05", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:53.276031", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1756, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [12294], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 543, "user_id": 3338, "topic_id": 510, "post_number": 1, "raw": "My studies in biology, agriculture and sociology took place in a time where the environmental, social and ethical problems related to the broken food system started becoming visible to more and more people across the world. Since about 10 years ago, food activism raised as our generations Woodstock, something that some of us like to call \u201cFoodstock\u201d. Therefore, the lines between political activism and an academic life started becoming very thin, and in times it felt -indeed- awkward to interact with two environments that hardly communicated to each other. Maybe for a good reason.\n\nIn 2007, I travelled to India for the first time, to do my MSc thesis in the Central Indian Himalayan belt, in collaboration with <a href=\"http://www.navdanya.org\">Navdanya</a>, an NGO founded by renowned food and seeds activist, Dr. Vandana Shiva. In 2008, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.de/Local-Plant-Knowledge-Livelihoods-Ethnobotanical/dp/382361519X\">I published my first book</a> on human-plant relations of tribal hill communities on the noble mountains of the Garhwal Himalaya. At the same time, returning to my university in Stuttgart, Germany, I helped found <a href=\"https://fresh.uni-hohenheim.de\">F.R.E.S.H. - the Food Revitalisation &amp; Ecogastronomic Society of Hohenheim</a>.\n\nF.R.E.S.H. was one of the very first student initiatives in Europe, trying to engage young agricultural students in a new, holistic, and self-reflective thinking about the future of the food system. We organised conferences, peaceful protests against unsustainable practices in the university\u2019s canteens, a student garden and we even designed and fundraised for a new academic module on the Ethics of Food &amp; Nutrition Security. Through community work in the campus, a group of young students from more than 15 countries from around the world, started building these much needed bridges between analytical thinking and solving the world\u2019s problems.\n\nAround this time, in 2008, I attended Slow Food\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWlBg9nr-HE\">Terra Madre</a> in Turin. This was a game changer, which allowed my friends and me see the wider picture, and to connect with hundreds of other youth. We saw the rise of the urban gardening movement and the food waste movement. We spoke of the need for intergenerational renewal in the agricultural sector, and we started connecting the dots. For us, good food and good farming almost became an obsession, and a latent hope that maybe we can manage to improving the world, by improving our food and our quality of life.\n\nAt the same year, still a student in Germany and doing my ethnobotanical research for my PhD in India, Thailand and China, I founded a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/slowfood.thrace\">Slow Food Convivium in Thrace</a>, my home land in Northern Greece. Well before the financial crisis and the social havoc it evoked hit home, we started discussing about resilience, an organic transition, urban gardens, quality food production/consumption systems. Early days for such ideas in Greece, this action has raised plenty of scepticism, as no-one would expect what was coming. Our actions ranged from organising public social meals in squares in streets, campaigns, food fairs, etc. I have organised three delegations of small Greek producers to Slow Food fairs in Italy and Germany, and as the crisis was unfolding, I wanted to show that a difference Greece exists -other than the one presented by the media and blamed by politicians- and it was here.\u00a0\n\nIn 2012, I produced an award winning short documentary, called \u201c<a href=\"http://www.vimeo.com/foodpolitics\">Farming on Crisis?</a>\u201d. This was the untold story of the Greek countryside, unfolding through a man's journey across the crisis-stricken country, uncovering the stories of young farmers and the prospects of revamping the economy through good farming and sustainable rural development. Building a bridge between the small and the large; the urban and the rural; the local with the global, the film used the case of Greece in order to touch urgent global challenges like food security, the environment and the future of our food. This movie travelled around the world, screened in several film festivals and opened a new dialogue: what future can we hope for, with only 6% of Europe\u2019s farmers under the age of 35? We even got an award in Hollywood.\n\nAs my life proceeded into this environment, I started venturing into good food entrepreneurship. From one side, I was launching global petitions for a better agricultural food system, to be presented at Rio+20, on the other hand I started discussing with my parents plans about revamping our family\u2019s traditional olive grove in Northern Greece. At 2012, we created <a href=\"http://www.calypsotree.com\">Calypso</a>, a single varietal extra virgin olive oil made inside the ancient grove of my small village, Makri. Our purpose was (and still is), not only to produce a product of the utmost quality, but to champion <a href=\"http://www.arc2020.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/arc2020-brochure-5-with-hyperlinks.pdf\">innovative agroecological practices</a>, trying to invite more farmers of the region in our journey towards sustainable quality. Soon after, I joined forces with another Italian friend from my former Slow Food years, and then we joined by another one, and another one, and we created <a href=\"http://www.wedelivertaste.com\">We Deliver Taste</a>. This is a small consultancy company connecting agriculture with gastronomy, hospitality and marketing. We are consulting good farmers and help them access new markets, while working with restaurant owners and chefs in order to close the loops in the \u201cbroken food system\u201d that we all new is a major part of the problem. This is of utmost importance for <a href=\"/t/transforming-food-systems-in-post-crisis-greece-conversation-with-pavlos-georgiadis-part-one/669\">Greece and its post-crisis future</a>,\u00a0 since the country has one of the largest per capita agricultural populations in Europe. We are now establishing new partnerships, working with ICT developers and experimenting on open data systems, with the aim of creating tools that bring more transparency and education in food supply chains, and shorten them in terms of communication and enhanced interaction among all peers.\n\nHaving experienced these transformation at the personal and social level, I still continue doing a lot of community research in Greece. To me, my country has emerged as a testing ground for <a href=\"/t/greece-as-a-hot-spot-of-transformative-future-conversation-with-pavlos-georgiadis-part-2/671\">a new transformative future</a>, what I like to call the \u201cPlan C\u201d. That is, if the \u201cPlan A\u201d is a Grexit, and \u201cPlan B\u201d is a devastating bankruptcy, then I think there is also space to investigate the possibility for another plant. <a href=\"http://www.ipsnews.net/2015/08/time-to-work-out-a-plan-c-for-greece/\">The \u201cPlan C\u201d has to do with the design of a roadmap for advancing towards a real transition back to the Commons</a>, based on civil engagement for participatory mapping and collective management of the assets that influence what is currently under attack: the everyday lives of the people.\n\nInspired by the many different communities on the rise throughout the country, and concerned about the lack of resources and the disconnection between them, \\#BackToCommons is my latest project. This is not an organisation (I don\u2019t think there is a need to be one - there are so many organisations which we work with), but rather an informal network of young researchers who are trying to pull resources for creating systemic infrastructure in Greece. The aim is to give a new hope to a desperate society, but also connect this action with the world, knowing that a lot of people in the ground don\u2019t have access to resources, due to many known barriers. Lack of funds and language are only two of them.\n\nI am not sure where the journey of \\#BackToCommons is going to end, but I am convinced that it is heading towards the right direction. More and more people in Greece start believing on the power of commons-based action, and what is considered an \u201calternative\u201d in other, more affluent economies of Europe in the world, over here is pretty much the only way forward. Despite the discontent, this offers a significant opportunity for working out transition solutions that I am sure are going to prove very useful for the international community.\n\nI know that given the political, organisational and financial support, realising this type of transition is\u00a0 one of the few chances we have in order to achieving the very possibility of realising the Sustainable Development Goals and the objectives mapped out at COP21. More importantly, as extremism is on the rise across the continent, what is needed more than ever before, are new narratives that connect our societies - not separate them. And in the absence of political sense, I think that we the people can still continue building them.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-29 09:33:55", "updated_at": "2018-05-24 12:33:28.513158", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1539, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 536, "user_id": 2569, "topic_id": 503, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<strong>What follows is a long story documenting some of\u00a0my experiences working as a caregiver on the Calais camp during March - May 2016.</strong>\n\nThe first thing that strikes you about the Calais camp is the smell. In the beginning you assume it comes from the camp itself. After prolonged exposure to it you realise it comes from the chemical plant next door. It pours a strange chemical tang over the surrounding area. I will never forget that smell. It masks the true nature of the camp.\n\nI use this image to emphasise the unsanitary conditions of the site, and how you become desensitised to them.\n\nEach morning at the l\u2019Auberge des Migrants Warehouse between 40-200 volunteers arrive to help with the day\u2019s tasks. It is one of 2 or 3 three aid organisations in the area serving the needs of the camp.\n\nThe number varies depending on the day of the week or the time of year. The tasks at the warehouse vary in difficulty and duration. Some people may find themselves chopping firewood for a day, or sorting through clothing donations. Those that can only volunteer for a day or two will do these jobs that base them at the warehouse. Volunteers that are available for a week or more will join the clothing or food distribution team. This involves spending a lot of time on the camp working face-to-face with refugees.\n\nVolunteers available for a month or more find themselves joining the 'Aid Distribution' or 'Vulnerabilities' team.\n\nThese teams work on the camp every day. Travelling from shelter to shelter to assess aid requirements and taking clothes and food to vulnerable people (children, elderly, injured). When i started at the Calais camp these teams didn\u2019t exist. I helped to set up, test and structure the team program. Now, 5 months later the teams are indistinguishable from the basic structures that i helped to set up.\n\nWorking days are long and filled with waiting. Long-term volunteers have to balance time considerations to get the most work done. Volunteers arrive early. UK volunteers have early Channel ferries to pack a full day in. Or the locals from Belgium and France are more balanced towards early starts. As a result the warehouse opens early with many arriving around 8am to start working.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum the refugees on the camp rarely rise before 11am. Many have been up for most of the night; making attempts to get into the port area, travelling to lorry parks nearby; etc. The camp itself comes to life at about 4pm with the most people around between 4pm and 10pm.\n\nThis means days often start with a lot of waiting. They often extend further into the evenings for the long-term volunteers. 12hr+ days without proper breaks are par for the course, particularly for the volunteers working on the camp with the refugees.\n\nThose working in the Aid Distribution team have to work in intimate personal spaces. The role requires you to enter into the shelters and tents of refugees to communicate with them. Preferably, this requires a translator, but most communication is through non-verbal, gesture and eye-contact. Even with a total language barrier, the way the refugees welcome you into their personal space is heart warming. The experience is unlike anything I have experienced elsewhere. For many British volunteers this immediate intimacy from strangers can be strange and disorienting. It feels odd to accept food, drink and hospitality from people who have so little already. Yet, rejecting the offer also seems heartless. It is difficult to balance these conflicting emotions. I often struggle to balance my desire to be \u2018efficient\u2019 at the task, with being \u2018friendly\u2019 to the people I\u2019m helping. I could spend a whole day working with only 10-15 people: Eating food with them; making notes about vulnerabilities; listening to the needs of their community and drinking sweet milk chai. Then I remember that there are thousands of people on the camp. If I spend the same amount of time with each group it would take years to finish the simple tasks.\n\nIn these small, intimate moments people open up to you. Some share stories, opinions on the camp or photos from their phones. Some photos are of family and home. Some photos are graphic images of violence and bloodshed. You never know if these images are from their own experience, or if they are from external sources. Almost every refugee can connect to the internet and people share images amongst groups. You know it would be rude to ask for verification. You are frequently reminded not to push anyone to tell you about their life before, or their journey. You are not a therapist and reliving traumatic experiences can re-traumatise them.\n\nThese moments also show you how angry people are. Refugees stop you in their shelters, or on the paths around the camp. Inter-community tensions seeps out through small cracks. The walls and fences of the Calais port don\u2019t discriminate between nations. So neither does the camp. Afghanis rub up against Iranians, Indians, Sudanese and Syrians. Some communities are better established on the camp. Some manage their resources and people better than others. Some communities have established 'leaders' who act as a lynchpin for fellow countrymen. I met a young Indian refugee who was angry there was no Indian community leader. I explained to him he was the first refugee from India i had met on the camp. He was de facto the community leader for his nation.\n\nRace, religion and resource issues overlap in a fraught and challenging space. It is surprising that it doesn't descend into violence more often. The fact it doesn't is a testament to the work done by volunteers, and faith and community leaders on the camp.\n\nWhen it does break down like this it is scary and totally unexpected. You can never relax into to the role. Every day demands that you prepare to be surprised. You can be disarmed by a moment of pure joy and positivity from a happy young man. Around the next corner you could be challenged by an angry refugee, or a major medical injury.\n\nSometimes the pressure comes from the armed police that surround the camp. At every entrance a bus full of armed police waits. They stop all vehicles going on to the camp. Sometimes they're friendly, sometimes officious, always confrontational. When there are problems on the camp or the nearby Motorway they respond with CS gas canisters. They fire them at will over the whole camp. Dispersing refugees into shelters. The canisters overheat when they let the gas out, this causes fires in the camp. Often the police target refugee communal areas like restaurants and shops. They try to use the gas to burn them down. I will never forget walking through the camp, under a thick fog of CS gas, my throat raw, shielding my watering eyes from the gas with a scarf.\n\nIn the end you start to live like the refugees on the camp: day-to-day, expecting the unexpected, desperate to get away to the \u2018real world\u2019 but somehow unable to move on.\n\nYou find yourself under the same strain as the refugees. You get emotionally attached to their quest. You want them to succeed at making it across the Channel. But when they leave the camp to try you feel a gut-wrenching fear for them. You\u2019ve heard too many bad stories \u2013 about the armed police; about the fascist skinheads that patrol around the ferry ports; and refrigerated lorries. Whilst I was there I met two people I later found out fell under the wheels of a moving lorry, or became trapped in airless lorry containers; suffocating to death.\n\nSometimes you hear someone you work alongside for months has made it across to the UK. You feel overwhelmingly happy for them. Then you feel sad and angry that you don\u2019t get to see them anymore. Then you feel guilty for being selfish.\n\nIn the end there is either hope, or hopelessness; Chance or no Chance. Both suffocate you and the refugees. It clouds all your conversations and interactions.\n\nMentally, the camp comes back with you into the volunteer spaces. Most volunteers are young people between the ages of 18 and 25. They are mostly students and temporary/seasonal workers. A lot of long-term volunteers work in the UK music festival community.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMental health for the volunteers is a concern. Everyone lives on a knife-edge. Most volunteers self-finance their time working in Calais. They live frugally, stretching their money out. This means they end up living on top of each other. The warehouse team has a caravan park attached to the building. Volunteers with no money can stay there. Living up to 6 people in a caravan, with limited access to hot water and personal space. Volunteers who live in this enclave have a different experience to those who stay in private accommodation or hostels.\n\nEveryone experiences some form of trauma. Most experience exhaustion. Often trauma comes from being in scary situations that you aren't trained to deal with. Occasionally volunteer social workers, therapists and psychologists stop by the volunteer camps. They offer their services for free. As always, the people who need it the most are most likely to not take advantage of these services.\n\nI met a few long term volunteers who had become caregivers 24/7. They would work long hours on the camp or managing the warehouse. In the evening they would sit listening to the emotional and personal problems of volunteers. They might operate on only 5-6 hours sleep per night and then do another 18hr day of work. Every day. Every week.\n\nDays off from the work of the warehouse and camp are encouraged, and even scheduled. But they are ignored, rescheduled, or simply don't happen. People feel responsible for the people on the camp. They can't switch off.\n\nThe management team at the warehouse made some great improvements even in the short time I was there. More training for long term volunteers on conflict resolution and dealing with difficult people. More training on how to self care and look after each other. The warehouse caravan park was designated an alcohol-free zone. Resident meeting were set back up. A weekly 'safe space' for free and open personal discussion was created in the warehouse. Weekly film screenings were restarted.\n\nOver all this positive improvement still hangs the uncertainty of the future. Volunteer numbers have decreased. Aid donations have slowed. Some organisations struggle to fundraise the money needed to provide services on the camp - for the first time since last year refugees on the camp report hunger and malnutrition.\n\nIn the face of this adversity volunteers get up every day and go onto the camp to help. They meet people new and old, hear new stories, discover new problems and show a friendly face to those in need. Not because it's their job, but because they feel a duty to help.\n\n\u00a0\n\nA 16yr old Afghani boy i worked with every day for 2 weeks asked me a question one night: \u201cWhy is the world so faithless?\u201d\n\nI didn't know how to respond at first. What did he mean? Was he asking about religion? I couldn't answer. So i thought for 10 minutes\n\nFinally, i responded:\n\n\"I don't think it is. The world is full for people who are scared. This fear drives their actions. But there are always others who respond to fear with love. This love is faith.\" He gave me a look that said 'strange European man, you know nothing of the world!'\n\nYet i stand by my answer. Every day hundreds of volunteers from all over Europe travel onto the Calais camp to show this love. They come with gifts and open hearts. They leave exhausted, frustrated and heartbroken. And they come back the next day, and the next. That has to be something positive.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDo you have similar experiences working with refugees in other parts of Europe?\n\nDo you have any useful experience that might help the volunteers at the camp?\n\nDo you have any ideas for how the Calais refugee situation could be re-structured after the evictions?\n\nAre there any other parts of my experience that you would like to learn more about?\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe production of this article was supported by <a href=\"/t/the-opencare-community-fellowship-program/5296\">Op3n Fellowships</a> - an ongoing program for community contributors during May - November 2016\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-16 14:35:13", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 02:33:56.559741", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2293, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 48.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2095], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2652, "user_id": 1935, "topic_id": 2619, "post_number": 1, "raw": "hi all ,\n\nhere is my contribution for the article about Egypt .\n\nWhat I had in mind that I can talk about 4 different not connected scenes in Egypt so as not to make the call for action seems to be limited to some target groups , I tried not to talk alot also in order not to make it big and boring .I only completed 2 scenes and the other 2 will be finished soon and for the arabic speakers on the site I wrote in egyptian arabic \" ammia \" in order to make it less formal do u think it 's ok or not please give me feedback about so we can all make a better final version --------------------------------\n\nscene 1\n\n<span>If you are moving on the ring road in the area between \"26 of july \"and \"Saft Ellaban\" you will pass by Al Mu'tamidia exit ramp .

Now Hany's kids are homeschooling with the help of \"Atef Rostom\" -hany's friend who is responsible for guiding and helping the kids and his daughter karima in their studies- and this gave them more time to play sports and interact with the \"real world\" more ,even Ahmed -Hany's older son - is interested in mobile and computer apps and tries to see lectures and read about it and Hany is helping him by getting him access to a programming company where he tested some of their apps as a user and saw how the process of programming is done.\n\nThe Kids faced some problems at first about the change in the way of learning and mainly because of the english language level but they are improving in a good pace. The idea of homeschooling in Egypt -in the words of Hany- is scary for some people like the idea of revolution and for others they don't have time to think for a solution for this problem because of the daily tiring work they do in order to make a living. but on the other hand there people interested in the idea and always asks how to do it. This was a another scene in the homeschooling community in Egypt which is growing and have different directions and systems\n\nsource :interview with Hany Elgamal\n\nscene 3\n\n<strong>In the heart of

To honestly explore our place in the world through a vision of stewardship is uniquely brave, some would say audacious.\n\nSince the formal closure of the unMonastery \u00a0Prototype Matera doors at the end of July, Katalin Hausel and Bembo Davies have spent the months compiling an extensive evaluation report /recipe book from the virtual dust of the unMonastery archives. \u00a0Cheekily dubbed \u201c<em>the Book of Mistakes</em>\u201d in a collective brainwave at LOTE3, <em>The Book Of Greater and Lesser Omissions</em> pieces together in a meticulous, albeit non-linear fashion the history of the triumphs and failures of the Matera prototype from LOTE#1 onwards. \u00a0It is not always a pretty sight. Our central conclusion: Follow-up is everything.\n\nAmong the mountain of documentation that the modern unMonasterian creates, the <i>principles</i> are clearly stated, there is plenty of <i>evidence</i> that good thinking has occurred. \u00a0What is more revealing is the gap that the challenge of unMonastery Lite illuminates: \u00a0true, responsible Stewardship is unRelentingly difficult.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://unmonastery-wiki.mirelsol.org/doku.php?id=book_of_mistakes\"><em><strong>Book of Greater and Lesser Omissions</strong></em></a> is expanding daily. \u00a0\u00a0Although its first public expos\u00e9 is at LOTE4, you are \u00a0perfectly welcome \u00a0familiarise yourself with its central arguments.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-10-28 12:22:22", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:21.078797", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 349, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13127, "user_id": 3074, "topic_id": 6091, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>link to opencare</b>\n\nby the way there is already a link to opencare (landing page for opencare on edgeryders.eu), we are right now live-promoting the project at the DSI fair, no need for \"what the hell\". :)\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-02-01 18:28:44", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:14.395121", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 45, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [12999], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11114, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 5501, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Hi, switched wires</b>\n\nI thought Noemi was going to be on and Noemi thought I was going to be on.

All the members of my family decided to spend part of their lives working hard for their community: two of my grandparents joined the Resistance against fascism. The brother of my grandfather was caught by the fascists during a fight, tortured and killed. He was only 16. My grandparents were poor workers and, after the end of the war, they lived out the changes of the 1950s and 1960s: they decided to fight with the Trade Union for their rights, they joined strikes and protests. Italy was changing, the economy flourished, but they stood up for a better life for everybody, as our Constitution says. My parents lived another important period of transformation: the 1970s. In these years, the Italian governments adopted some of the most important laws of modern history: the Workers' Statute, the law that built the national and public health system, etc. My family was part of these goals.\n\nI have breathed this tradition and these values since I was born: my parents were involved in a party, so it was easy for me to learn the importance of policy and participation. When I was 14, Italy was living a restless moment: Silvio Berlusconi became the Prime Minister with several proposal of changing, for example about public school. He decided to cut the public fund for the school system while his Government approved more for private schools. I attended my first year of High School and the effects of these decisions were terrible: for the first time our school was poorer than ever. Students decided to stand up against: strikes were organized and students took part in public demonstration with their own teachers. We were worried about our future because we soon understood that politics can really change our lives. For me it was a period of discover:y I swiftly grew up and I decided to do something. I became a member of a Party (Left-wing Democrats). At the beginning it was quite difficult to understand how a political party lives and works because political relationships were something new to me, but I felt that I was in the right place. I joined the Left-wing Youth, a political organization for young members of the Party, and I begin my activity in my school: we printed a small newspaper in which we wrote about wrong decisions of the Government and about our aspirations for the future. We organized several protest against Government's laws, especially about justice and workers' rights. We were young, but we were diligent, careful and really impassioned. I admit I was also idealistic, because policy was a lot for me: it meant culture and activity, but friendship too. In a couple of year, the leader of the organization asked me to coordinate the activity in all schools of Modena: it was exciting, but it was also a small sacrifice. The life of a teenager is quite complicated and it's easy to understand that her political life is a mess! The general absence of comprehension was a real limit: lots of adults and teens didn't really understand the meaning of our activity and it was difficult to me to explain them. The primary enemy of participation is resignation: Italian people very often think that policy is something bad, dirty and useless and there is no chance to change the situation. My passion was only a drop in the sea of mistrust.\n\nWhen I was almost 18, I quit the activity among the school world and I began a new experience in my city. It was a turning point because for the first time I faced the meaning of governing. Modena is a rich 180,000 inhabitants city, but there were lots of problem: Modena is situated in a polluted area and a huge part of the population consists in elderly people. Issues like the protection of the environment, policies for young people, welfare policy, etc. switched a meaningful debate among the citizens. My feelings about policy became more and more mature: I deeply understood that policy was a complicated matter and a political party must consider all the request from society and bring them to a synthesis. It was difficult for me to conciliate my own values and the need of the majority, but it was great to follow the continue effort to questioning my certainties about everything. One of the best aspect of policy is living in a persisting doubt about what's right and wrong and about the quality of your vision.\n\n2007 was an important year of change: for the first time in Italian history, two political party decides to unify their structures in order to give another party birth. My party deliberated his own extinction and this was the birth act of the Democratic Party (PD). There was a great popular movement for the choice of the first Democratic leader: 3 millions of Italian people spontaneously voted in these election. I remember it as one of the most beautiful pages of my political path. I had been elected in the first Democratic assembly. A few months after, I had been elected as local secretary of the Party in my neighborhood: I was only 19, I was excited, but also a little bit scared. My neighborhood is characterized by several problem about environment (it's the location of an incinerator) and racial hatred because of the high presence of foreign citizens. It's a complicated territory but I caught the challenge: I did my best to create participation and to restore a confident relation between citizens and politics. I organized public meeting and debates, trying to involve a crescent number of people. I admit that my activity collected also some moments of disappointment, but I was faithful and the passion of the other members of my group was an important thrust.\n\nIn 2009 I was candidate as member of the City Council at local elections. It was my first real political competition and I remember that it was really tiring: as a young woman, it was very difficult for me to affirm my ideas and to be taken seriously. With no famous supporter and no famous curriculum, it's difficult to win an election. I moved from house to house trying to spread my ideas and my program; I met lots of angry people, angry with politicians and I first of all tried to listen because policy has a real need of understand what people ask for. The coalition of parties that I supported won the election and I have been elected as a member of the Council. I was the youngest member in the history of Modena. Now I'm still working for my city: my favorite issues are social policy, protection of the environment, workers' right, multiculturalism, civil rights and rights of prisoners in the local jail. My activity is completely voluntary and I am proud and honored to work for the community that I love.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-02-24 20:13:18", "updated_at": "2017-09-20 17:21:40.016633", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1210, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27487, "user_id": 3310, "topic_id": 6059, "post_number": 15, "raw": "<b>geen probleem!</b>\n\nDat valt mee.

They will be invited to co-design sessions.\n\nMoreover, co-design meeting will be open to everyone (registration required) and also people from the community of WeMake will participate to the activity.\n\n<strong>Program Schedule</strong>\n\nFirst Session | Wednesday, May 4th, 2016 | 6 p.m. - 9.30 p.m\n\nSecond Session | Wednesday, May 11th, 2016 | 6 p.m. - 9.30 p.m\n\nThird Session | TBD, june 2016\n\nAll the sessions will be hosted by WeMake\n\n<strong>First meeting |Wednesday, May 4th, \u00a02016 | 6 p.m. - 9.30 p.m</strong>\n\n<strong>Opencare staff:</strong>\n\nGisella Bassanini (Architect, Facilitator) \u00a0\n\nCostantino Bongiorno, Roberta Ribero, Alessandro Contini, Chiara Ferrero, Silvia D\u2019Ambrosio (WeMake)\n\nRossana Torri; Alberto Simonetti, Annacristina Siragusa (Comune di Milano)\n\nAndrea Balossi - video operator\n\n<h4>Specific attention paid to \u201cethical considerations\u201d:</h4>\n\nParticipation was voluntary. The Opencare team have carefully explained rules and privacy implications for participants, which gave consent for the treatment of their data and anonymously sharing their stories on the web. Participants have been asked to sign a consent form well-prepared and shared with Marco Manca, Scimpulse.\n\nThe collected data and information coming from the discussion will be treated confidentially and will be not linked to any named person.\n\n<strong>Working method:</strong>\n\nParticipants have worked in small groups. One facilitator has assisted each group, in order to create an environment for effective communication, keep discussion focused, keep people engaged, provide opportunities to all voices to be heard.\n\nAudio and video of the meeting has been integrally recorded.\n\nWhat we asked participants to do:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\tto focus on one or at most two practical needs in the sphere of daily care activities;</li>\n\n<li>\tto \u201cvalidate\u201d them through a group discussion and choose one for each group;</li>\n\n<li>\tto present the concept of the selected need in a plenary session.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\u00a0\n\nWELCOME AND INTRO (6.15 TO 6.45)\n\nRossana - City of Milan: Opencare approach, partnership, goals\n\nAlessandro Contini - WeMake: Examples of community-based solutions\n\nCostantino Bongiorno - WeMake: Co-design process at whole and single steps\n\nAs usual, when the practical examples are presented people start to understand better the project and to interact, also commenting the cases. The Edna\u2019s case (<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/59575065\">clip</a>) seems to be inspiring.\n\nWhen Costantino talks about the different working groups, the man in wheelchair comments in an ironical way that he cannot go upstairs to work.\n\nTalking about personal examples can be a good way to engage the audience: if participants see that you open yourself, they will feel more comfortable to open themselves as well.\n\nAn old lady asked to use only Italian words (\u201cplug in\u201d is avoided). She is very proactive.\n\nGROUPWORK (6.45 TO \u00a08.00 PM)\n\n3 groups with altogether 27 participants (15 women and 12 men) joined the co-design session. The groups have been pre-formed in order to ensure a balance of genders, age and background.\n\nThe groups were called \u201cHammer\u201d, \u201cPincer\u201d, \u201cScrewdriver\u201d, to evoke object's most common use in a manufacture. Each participant received a sticker to mark the affiliation to a specific group.\n\nThe reaction of people after receiving the sticker was really good, as they showed appreciation to have a role (they said \u201cAh! We are in the same group, cool!\u201d). The grouping of people seemed to be like a head count in school, and participants were looking forward to start working. It appears that they like the idea of working with new people.\n\n<strong>The tools:</strong>\n\nInstant Report Sheet\n\nAt the start of the session, each person received a pen and a paper with plenty of space to answer to the question: \u201cPlease, describe one (at most two) needs/obstacles related to daily care activities and/or the need for care for affected family member(s)\u201d, eventually suggesting solutions you have already attempted\u201d\n\nThis phase lasted 10 minutes.\n\nWe adapted the Open Space Technology (OST), as suggested by Gisella, in order to have the possibility of creating instant proceedings of the session.\n\nBecause the participants are not equipped with PCs, hand-written sheets have been fully transcribed.\n\nThese are collected in an \u201cInstant book\u201d of the session.\n\nThe original \u201cstories\u201d will be posted on the Opencare Platform as \u201cChallenges\u201d\n\nExplanation of the tools, and they are immediately starting thinking about the possible need that they have. Most of them have difficulties to think about a need, so they stay for a while looking at the paper.\n\nParticipant with \u201cphysical\u201d disabilities discusses with her tutors/friends about their possible need. A man, after finishing writing, clicks the pen on the paper and breathes in a satisfied way.\n\n<strong>Group discussion:</strong>\n\nParticipants have been then asked to discuss their individual issues with the group.\n\nThe purpose of the discussion is to share and select one (at most two) individual needs/obstacles to be submitted to the plenary.\n\nThree to six of the emerging problems will be the subjects of the next co-design session, which aims at the co-design of feasible solutions.\n\n<strong>Plenary restitution:</strong>\n\nThe groups have presented at the plenary session their arguments, summarized through a slogan, a description of the need/obstacle, and a \"target population\u201d.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\tNo sbatti (don't\u2019 fucking crash) - The autonomy is better if it is outside, so is strongly related to accessibility/mobility. A big problem is therefore that of the physical barriers that prevent those who are not entirely autonomous to move around the city freely and safely.</li>\n\n<li>\tStai Sciallo (Take it easy) \u2013 represents the need to recognize panic attacks and something that can help to face them.</li>\n\n<li>\t\u201cMezzo vuoto, mezzo pieno\u201d (Half full, half empty) \u2013 represents the need of something that can prevent throwing things in toilets, but can help Muslims to wash themselves (as the Islamic faith has particular rules regarding personal hygiene when going to the toilet).</li>\n\n<li>\t\u201cOPS\u201d (Need help): People suffering from epilepsy and sometime have seizures, run the risk of falling down or become confused/only partly aware of what is happening around them. Surroundings could be a safety risk.</li>\n\n<li>\t\u201cLet's share information and good practices to support autonomy\u201d. Autonomy concerns both the private and the public dimension. A big issue is the lack of interconnection and sharing of information and expertise.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThe co-design second session will start from this point to develop possible solutions to prototype.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b0f4a89b964b44f43a2015247b4066a52bd034ac.jpg\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/2/229f57a2a350994014ff36a5c98e64c58eb42151.jpg\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\">\n\n", "created_at": "2016-05-10 14:13:08", "updated_at": "2018-05-26 05:35:49.458110", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1746, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1003, 3074], "is_private": false}, {"id": 866, "user_id": 3596, "topic_id": 833, "post_number": 1, "raw": "After the first submission, our original project \"doc.doc\" (https://edgeryders.eu/en/node/7847) got some feedbacks and contributes that conviced us to implement those inspirations that eventually\u00a0turned out the early project in ResQ!\n\nIn particular was pointed out how the core concept of our proposal could have been way more effective if applied in critical healthcare context (such as\u00a0emergency hospitals and refugees reception centers) where the language barriers affect the quality and efficacy of the medical treatment.\n\n\u00a0Following is the brief description of our updated project, ResQ, we would love to hear your thoughts about it!\n\n\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t<strong>Our project in a tweet</strong>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nResQ is an app for physicians working in emergency contexts, that digitalise the health information of patients, so to make them easily available for colleagues.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t<strong>Problem that our project\u00a0is willing to solve</strong>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nCurrently, the first aid provided to refugees arriving in Italy is effective in terms of solving the main health issues (healing of hurts due to the journey, or state of fever), but at the same time is not very efficient because of the superficial anamnestic research that physicians are compelled to make in such situations.\n\nIn addition, the information gathered about the health state of each patient, are stored in simple paper sheets, preventing a further the potential of a pervasive sharing that a digital format would easily allow.\n\nThe current way of working shows the following problems:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>\tThe language barrier prevent a proper communication between the physician and the patient. Is usually delegated to the patients the duty of providing the accurate information about their health condition every visit.</li>\n\n<li>\tThe missing digitalization of the gathered health data and the consequent discontinuity of the healing process.</li>\n\n<li>\tThe limited precision of the anamnestic research due to the high number of patients and the short time available.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t<strong>Final User, individuals and\u00a0community target</strong>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nResQ is conceived to ease the communication among physicians (involved in critical context such as emergency hospitals and refugees reception centers) regarding the health state of foreigner patients who don\u2019t know the language of the hosting country.

Also, the digitalization of such a document would make possible an extensive sharing with colleagues that later will take care of the same patient.\n\nTherefore the physician will have the chance to communicate autonomously among themselves without misunderstanding through the management tool.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/59d8988ca8044f14d29e58fa6f64cd86cf635ad8.jpg\" width=\"409\" height=\"500\">\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t<strong>Technologies we will adopt</strong>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThe tool we are designing will be developed in order to be accessible from the main devices available on the market.

This is a very good sign I'd think. Now I'm not trained in the field but I'll throw around my 2 cent:\n\nI haven't read the paper yet (will certainly do so later).\n\nThe part of the maps that is directly important to 95% of the people are the 3-4 rings at the center. Unfortunately these can hold the least information space-wise. The higher levels are likely to be (also) addressed by slightly different tools anyway (though I think there is merit to the stactivism approach - even though I'd call it (socio-)tech-mesh). The other issue is that it asks for a pretty high level of abstraction, which you cannot expect to meet in many subsistence based villages (geographic maps can be a real challenge). It'd be worth a try to see what feedback you get though, these things can be hard to predict. I think you'd ideally have a couple of examples on hand that explain how to fill out\u00a0 the maps in various ways (without introducing ambiguity). My gut feel is that you'll at least want to have pictos for the basis, and perhaps also as sort of stickers to place on the map. There could be a sort of legend that can be used for detailed explanations. I would try to push for a color coding of the segments that could also be used in marking problem sites in conjunction with the orange/triangle symbol and not mess up established color codes.\n\nOne fundamental issue I have with the map is that it lacks a \"contribution/action potential side\". Here I'd propose something like this https://edgeryders.eu/en/comment/17284#comment-17284 (criticism welcome!). Perhaps it would make sense to fill out a few of them at the same time doing a \"status quo\" and also a, say, 1 month forecast.

Thank you also for sharing the story of your great-grandma and grandma - that's very powerful indeed.\n\nI must apologise for not being clearer in my original post. While the concept of discovering, telling and sharing stories about our older members of society underpins Remarkable Lives, the enterprise I am building is a social networking platform.\n\nTo clarify, the current phase is where I am interviewing older people and publishing their stories on the photoblog - the purpose of this is to raise awareness and a sense of community appreciation around the Remarkable Lives project. If you like, what I am doing now is trying to get people tuned in to the idea of celebrating the life stories of their older relatives by actually telling some stories myself.\u00a0\n\nWhen my social networking platform (or application - hence sometimes referring to it as an App) is live, that will be like me handing it over to society, to the public, as in: \"Here you are. I've been telling some stories to give you a flavour of the rich and diverse lives older people have led. Now it's over to you to discover the stories in your own families and share them with each other.\" And for the general public\u00a0the platform will be free to start creating Remarkable Lives profiles.

(i.e. the space experience in life)\n\nIn Addition:\n\nThere could be symbolic ratings alongside each paragraph in the 'Mainstream' for promoting Plain English (1 - 5 crystal glasses?) and a tick box for 'English, she not my mother tongue!'\n\nSimilarly, the 'Margin' column of images and imaginative responses could have symbol ratings (1 - 5 cloudy-to-clear skies?) denoting whether the responding image, poem, physical gesture, joke or juxtaposed bit of 'beyond-rational' was found to be evocative, humorous or have resonance.\n\nOpt in or out\n\nWe could each choose the option to receive existing traditional text communications without a complimentary column, or instead to receive the dual track with an extra column of off-the-wall expressions. (Bring on the app that turns copy into comic!)\n\nRationale\n\n1. There is an appetite in people for non-verbal/non-literate expression beyond words and proposals. Why not give this actual space?\n\n2. A certain proportion of people who we meet and enthusiastically encourage to check out ERs come back and say, \"Great concept but found the language a bit hard to connect with\".\n\n3. Many individuals in ERs are from the margins, the place where almost all progressive social change has emerged, but when we get together through ER on-line, in Hangouts or at Lote, we are then creating a mainstream.

My name is Eka,\u00a0I have been working aas a journalist for about 12 years. During the years I have been working as a newsmaker, a reporter, wrote analytic articles, and covered issues in conflicting zones and also investigation stories. Nowadays, I work as a journalist; consultant and media trainer.\n\nThe following story is an article that I wrote about a situation in Georgia which needs attention: internally displaced people. As some of you might know, they live in horrible circumstances and face major difficulties. As a journalist, I am one of the few who tries to pay attention to this. You must understand, most georgians don't know and don't really care what's going on with IDPs (internal refugees), but their story needs to be told, and tnat's what I am trying to do. So, to be frank, and this might be a bit arrogant, this is a story about me, how i try to change the livelihoods of the IDPs through media. I hope you will either accept this story, or another story, from me. I would also love to participate in the workshops you have planned.\u00a0\n\n<strong><em>Journalistic investigation</em></strong>\n\nAn IDP, a socially vulnerable body, mother of a little boy Luka who has passed through 12 surgeries threatens with committing suicide.\n\n<strong>\u201cThe Ministry of IDPs gave me 100% guarantee that I would receive a living flat, but they left me without shelter again.\u201d</strong>\n\nDiagnosis \u2013 hydrocephalyd,<a name=\"_GoBack\"></a> 12 times operated, including bypass surgery of \u00a0the head, chained to the bypass apparatus which due to a \u201cvagrant life\u201d and abnormal conditions often breaks down. Operations are needed in succession. No shelter, no hygiene, no treatment, no rehabilitation, no wholesome food; medicines \u2013 only sometimes. This is a current state of a 3,6 years old Luka Maghlakelidze. The first operation was made in 1 hour afterthe birth. Since then he needs operations several times per annum.\n\n<strong>\u201e</strong><strong>Mother of invalid child was left without shelter. We can\u2019t overcome illness\u2026\u2019\u2019</strong>\n\n\u201cYou started distribution of flats in Temka and didn\u2019t call me, do you? You can\u2019t imagine the extent of such impact. Tomorrow I will go on hunger strike in front of the Ministry of IDPs with my ill, with fevered child . . . How do you behave? I am very irritated and want nothing except for death . . . The whole Georgia will get about my story when I burn myself with my ill child in front of your Ministry. It seems that you don\u2019t evaluate amicable relations. I have been tired of praising and what have you done? I pray for surviving today and tomorrow I know what I should do . . . I hoped that humane people came to the government and we are rescued. . .\u201d This letter was composed by mother of a 3,5 years old Luka, - 24 years old woman InezaGigani and sent to the Ministry of Internally Displaced Persons from the Occupied Territories, Accommodation and Refugees of Georgia.\n\nI was one of the addressees of this letter being a former employee of the Ministry of IDPs. I replied on the letter. She was astonished by the fact that she received a humane response. To tell the truth I haven\u2019t written \u201canything especial\u201d; simply I put myself in her position. According to her, she didn\u2019t expect that somebody would reply. She expressed her gratitude many times, asked for meeting with me and I agreed.\n\n<strong>InezaGigani:</strong> \u201cTogether with a status of an IDP, I have a status of a socially vulnerable body. We live in very poor conditions. . . We have been looking forward to paying attention on us and resolving our problems for many years. Before distribution of flats in Temka among IDPs, I had completed a special questionnaire form. I had a meeting in the Ministry of IDPs with the Deputy Minister and a Head of Department as well. All of them were informed about my state. They gave me 100% guarantee that I would be the first in the list of beneficiaries.\u201d\n\n<strong>\u201cJournalist\u201d:</strong> Mrs. Ineza, you are in extremely poor conditions. However, the MRA couldn\u2019t provide you with a 100% guarantee for providing accommodation as distribution of flats depends upon the scores fixed in the IDPs Questionnaire Form proceeding from a state of the applicant . . .\n\n<strong>I.G.:</strong> I was promised by the Deputy Minister that, due to my state, in the process of distribution of flats, I would be the first in the list. I had a meeting with him and even submitted a letter for the Minister. He promised me to hand it to him. I was pregnant that time, and after going there many times I got recurrent miscarriage. I was looking forward the distribution of flats. Counted days, planned a design of a child\u2019s room. I had a hope of his recovery. I hoped that he would live in normal environment, provided with relevant hygiene. I would take care of him and my state would be improved. However, as it was informed by the Ministry, the flats had already been distributed without me.\n\nThe letter sent to the Ministry and to other addressees was written exactly that day when she heard about distribution of flats from mass media. She, as she promised in the letter, couldn\u2019t come in the Ministry next day as the state of her child had beenworsened, he had convulsions.\n\n<strong>\u201cMother of an invalid child is left without shelter again. We can\u2019t overcome the illness . . .\u201d \u2013 InezaGigani once again.</strong>\n\n<strong>-------------------</strong>\n\n<strong>\u201cHe can\u2019t stand up, can\u2019t eat, can\u2019t talk\u201d</strong>\n\n<strong>------------------</strong>\n\nLuka had his first surgery on the head when he was only 1,5 months old. Extract from the medical conclusion: \u201cExternal by-pass operation on the ventricle system was made to the 1,5 months old patient due to ventriculitis on the left side, and when he reached age of 3 months \u2013 on the vps right side. Additionally, on 13.01.11 invasion of a by-pass was made due to formation of a cyst. A detailed medical research revealed a 32-33 mm neoplasm on the right ventricle.\n\nGeneral illnesses: \u201c prenatal sepsis, ventriculitis, congenital hernia of umbilical cord, lagging in psycho-motoric development\u201d, \u201cmeningitis in the age of 3 weeks\u201d, \u201cwas born with gastroshisis, passed a neurosurgical operation\u201d, \u201csince then the child had 5 neurosurgical operations . . . \u201c\n\n\u201cHe can\u2019t hold his head, can\u2019t eat, can\u2019t talk, has his vision worsened\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a life of vagrants; due to our inhuman conditions we needed so many surgeries. A 3,5 years old child lays all the time. I have no even a baby carriage . . . We need inhaler as problems with breathing were added. But nobody pays attention on us,\u201d \u2013 says my respondent.\n\n<strong>\u201cJournalist\u201d:</strong> Does a police help you as to a socially vulnerable body?\n\n<strong>I.G.:</strong> We have made 12 operations by that police. We couldn\u2019t finance any of these operations by any way proceeding from lack of recourses. Actually, we grew in the hospital. The child requires rehabilitation but because of the lack of financial resources we can\u2019t start it. Problems with gastrointestinal tract were added as well because of immobility of the child, but we can\u2019t treat it.\n\n<strong>\u201cJournalist\u201d: </strong>Why did the child need 12 operations, were the illnesses inherent?\n\n<strong>I.G.</strong> The child was born with gastroshisis (opened stomach). It doesn\u2019t represent a serious problem. The first operation was conducted in one hour since the birth. Later he faced with neonatal sepsis in the hospital which was followed by staphylococcus, and meningitis. And all this resulted in the current illness.\n\nAn IDP from OchamchireInezaGigani narrates that she was hiring a flat in Gldani but she couldn\u2019t pay a rent and was forced to leave it. She got married to a non-IDP who is currently unemployed. They have another child. He doesn\u2019t go to kindergarten as after eviction from Gldani they were sheltered by parents settled in Vaziani military settlement. She adds that taking the child to a kindergarten located in Gldani is impossible and the Vaziani kindergarten has no vacant places.\n\n<strong>\u201cLuka can move his hands and feet but can\u2019t sit, can\u2019t talk, can\u2019t chew. We take antibiotics all the time. We needed 12 operations due to absence of elementary conditions. An apparatus inserted in the head often breaks down. The child is catching colds and viruses all the time\u201d, - says Ineza.</strong>\n\n<strong>----------------------------------</strong>\n\n<strong>Reason for refusal of the MRA</strong>\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nAs for the process of distribution of living flats conducted by the Ministry of Internally Displaced Persons from the Occupied Territories, Accommodation and Refugees of Georgia, this process is provided according to special criteria. An IDP is obliged to fill in a special questionnaire form indicating the whole information which reflects a current state of that IDP. All this is evaluated by scores. At the first stage are satisfied the families having the highest scores received.\n\nWe checked information about InezaGigani in the Ministry of Internally Displaced Persons from the Occupied Territories, Accommodation and Refugees of Georgia. The Ministry confirmed that InezaGigani had really participated in all procedures necessary for receiving of a flat, and was evaluated by 7 scores. However, at this stage she hadn\u2019t been provided with the flat.\n\n\u201cInezaGiganicompleted a questionnaire form designed for receiving of living flats, with two children and the non-IDP husband. The form was considered by a relevant Commission and awarded with 7 scores. Socially vulnerable family \u2013 3 scores; a child-invalid of II group \u2013 2 scores; lives in rent \u2013 1 score; often changes living flats \u2013 1 score. While consideration of the questionnaire forms for the Temka site 90 families were awarded 7 scores, among them the Commission selected 11 families.InezaGigani didn\u2019t receive a priority as she delivered a false information concerning to her incomes. In addition, parents of her husband has an own living house located on GiorgiAghmashenebeliave. 33a. Information about number of scores of InezaGigani is already sent on the address indicated in the questionnaire form,\u201d \u2013 this was an official information provided by the Ministry.\n\nAccording to InezaGigani, she can\u2019t understand and nobody explained to her what does the \u201cfalse information\u201d mean. The Ministry of IDPs explained in words her husband possesses his own flat.\n\n\u201cThis is a lie; my husband doesn\u2019t have any flat. If you consider my father-in-law, I and my husband don\u2019t have any relations with him. The space which was recognized as a \u201cfalse information\u201d by the Ministry is owned by my father-in-law and is burdened with hypothecs; later it was rented by another family. If my father-in-law has something registered, why should I and my children be responsible for this and punished? Besides, we aren\u2019t married officially, and in case of my desire to submit any false information I wouldn\u2019t disclose any information about my husband. As I didn\u2019t follow a false way, fixed actual state why have I got such a result?\u201d \u2013 asks Gigani.\n\nAs it was investigated by us, several years ago this family was given a living space by the former Government. They lived in Isani military hospital. However, life in the hospital and conditions existing there is another problem, but they were satisfied with obtaining the shelter, but even in such case they weren\u2019t lucky. They had been living there for 6 months and later they were settled out from that shelter.\n\n\u201cThe state of the child was worsened and \u00a0spent 2 weeks in the hospital. Then we moved to parents for rehabilitation for some time as I couldn\u2019t take care of the child in the military hospital due to unsatisfied conditions. When we returned to the military hospital other family had been settled in and our belongings thrown out. I was explained that as I hadn\u2019t been living there I didn\u2019t need it. I don\u2019t know what to do, where to appeal for help . . .\u201d \u2013 says Ineza.\n\nRegulation of living conditions is significant in addition to the Luka\u2019s treatment as these problems are interconnected. He doesn\u2019t have conditions necessary for rehabilitation.\n\nAs it was stated by InezaGigani, there is no importance of where they will live, she will agree even for a village if there hadn\u2019t been one problem: \u201cLuka often suffers from convulsion. In Vaziani he had lost consciousness two times before emergency came. We met the emergency in Lilo. We are chained with hospital. We will live in any place but because of the state of child we can\u2019t live in a village. Luka will celebrate his 4th birthday soon but his weight is only 9 kg.\u201d\n\nLuka\u2019s medical documents, receipts, prescriptions, researches cover tens of pages. All sheets are started with the following words: \u201cconducted . . .\u201d, \u201cdiagnosed . . .\u201d, \u201cneeds . . .\u201d. The most painful for parents is the part of medical conclusion where recommendations are indicated for the child as they preliminary know that they won\u2019t fulfill prescription of the doctor. They also know that they will buy medicines only when they will have money, or, buy them only for some days and then terminate the treatment again.\n\nConcerning to the above-stated history we appealed to the apparatus of the Public Defender of Georgia. According to the Deputy Public Defender PaataBeltadze, monitoring of distribution of flats among IDPs will be intensified: \u201cIt is very complicated history. The apparatus of the Public Defender often receives similar applications. The family should appeal to us with a letter describing a concrete history. The issue will be considered by specialists and we will be involved into settlement of this issue as much as possible. The apparatus of the Public Defender is going to intensify monitoring of the process of distribution of flats among IDPs and to take more efficient measures from the viewpoint of its monitoring and justice.\n\nP.S. Due to our assistance, one of the non-governmental organizations assigned means for procurement of medicines and food for Luka which will be enough for one month. We will make all efforts to pay more attention on regulation of the stated problem\n\n", "created_at": "2014-03-19 15:07:03", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:13.643455", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2482, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 20.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856, 45], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23464, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 1501, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Follow up to your contribution? </b>\n\nHi Jane!\n\nLong time since we last heard from you, how are things, any improvements since you wrote this post?

So after reading and thinking through itI, I thought to contribute my take on it.\n\n<strong>Quoting Nadia:</strong>\n\n<span>\"[...] my access to all of those things I care about is determined by changes that happen on a global scale. And my mind also knows that unless I get in the game and try to affect change so that life doesn\u2019t completely suck for those of us who are in the proverbial middle class, there\u2019s a node missing in the needed network.\"</span>\n\n<strong>Same start, but ... .</strong> Yea I pretty much came to the same conclusions: that the world won't become any better place if not everybody, including me, jumps in and makes it so. But then it totally frustrated me to see how best efforts can be undone by others' selfish acts and everybody's carelessness.\n\n<strong>For example,</strong> positive feedback loops are great while the self-enforcing process works, but \"in the wild\" one cannot do anything against negative mechanisms interfering and potentially destroying them. Real-world emergence has not just the peaceful, benevolent LumiBots, but also <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T500ecHP3pE#t=00m40s\">these guys</a>. Sad as that is.\n\n<strong>\"Global\".</strong> There's no way for anybody in a globalized society to create and maintain any improvement ... if it happens, it's chance. Even social movements cannot maintain their own cohesion and continuity - large systems just have too big momentum for any individual to steer their course. Globalized society is just unmanageable, in my view. Some try to occupy their node in the global network as good and responsibly as they can, without knowing if they will succeed in improving anything. I've got deep respect for these folks (like Nadia), but am too frustrated about uncertain and temporary success to join in.\n\n<strong>\"Local\".</strong> My view on things brightened again when I read resilience thinker John Robb say \"Globalize information, localize everything else.\" Local autarky is a kind of practical philosophy for me now - I envision living in a 200 people autarkic, sustainable, self-directed commune (<a href=\"http://opensourceecology.org/wiki/Global_Village_Construction_Set\">hint, hint</a>). And if that falls apart or surrounding policies go mad, all my personal equipment is (already, right now) in a truck to just leave. And if that fails, I should have survival skills and a backpack of good equipment. This is not being antisocial: I'm happy with sharing everything that enables such localization for free, for the world to replicate it. I'm just not happy with an unmanageable world, interfering with my life. Localization is just better systems engineering, in my view - compare it to cells in a body. More on that in an upcoming mission report.\n\nOn another note, Nadia: About being poor, I very much feel with you. And in retrospect, it's good ingredients for understanding the world by experience, isn't it? Had such poor times myself. I remember myself spending my last 15 EUR for food, and everything I needed was offered as a bargain that day. Felt like a miracle, and I attributed it to Jesus :-)\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-23 22:14:14", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:14.055287", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 568, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 45.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3791], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33025, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 4192, "post_number": 46, "raw": "<b>Looks cool!</b>\n\nthanks @emkay, nice idea :) Am racing towards some deadlines this week, but will put post some comments as soon as I have a moment.

They gave me a 'diploma' at the end of the 2-month training, although I found no job.\n\nEveryone from there had no clue what open government is about. They had never heard of it before.\n\nFurthermore, these women told me they had never seen a resume like mine. They said that I am a special case, a sort of strange phenomenon. Out of the box. These women did not know what to do with me.\n\nI had to do a recruitment simulation, as part of this program. They set me up with the ex woman director of their center. They called someone of a high caliber to interview me.\n\nShe probably did not understand what is the open government philosophy, but she told me that I can convince. She said that I have these skills. I felt relieved by this comment, because I do not talk much in real life. Besides my strong presence in social media, I can go days without opening my mouth, and it's fine with me: I like just Being. I can spend hours with someone without saying a word, just observing this person, listening to her talk and enjoying her presence. This is not really the kind of individual found in the sphere in which I would like to be successful. So I had very serious doubts about me.\n\nThis recruitment experience and job training center did not help me to get a job, but it gave me wings.\n\nTwo weeks after completing the training, I spent my savings to go to Edmonton, Alberta, and meet with open government advocate, Adriel Hampton, and several other advocates and government officials.\n\nAnd shortly after that, I met John F Moore, CEO of Government in the Lab. I ended up doing a lot of volunteer work for TheLab, because we couldn't find the money to pay for my work.\n\nI was getting increasingly nervous, I thought that I did everything the wrong way, because I could not come to reach any financial success in my numerous business development efforts.\n\nTo make a long story short, in September 2011, I decided to enroll in a second training program. There must have been something that I had not learned well yet. So I went back to school.\n\nThis program was different from the first. It was more condensed, and it was open to both men and women. We had to follow a strict procedure. There was a strict scenario for everything, and they made sure we were respecting it. When I made a phone call - I tried my luck with municipalities in my area - I was transferred directly to the mayor of the city. The proposed scenario was not designed for self-employed or consultant workers. It was for employees, such as secretaries, salesmen, mechanics, etc.\n\nFurthermore, mayors did not know about the open government philosophy, and they did not know that the provincial government was studying and analyzing possibilities of open government policies. I ended up having to do free public relations for the government, before getting the chance to introduce myself. \u00a0I failed respecting the scenario code. I was unable to convert my story into their given script.\n\nParticipants of this program had to do a filmed interview (simulation of a recruitment). I was asked to make a simulation as if I applied to a Communications Officer position. Something I did at the beginning of my career.\u00a0 Sweeping away my professional experience of the past 20 years. All the questions revolved around 'how do you get into the mold'. I was not able to answer. I realized that all my life, I was out of the mold. After failling at this recruitment simulation, I am a little ashamed to admit it here, but I was promptly fired from the training program. They said that they have only one approach, and that I do not fit.\n\nI applied to another program, for self-employed workers in a precarious financial situation. My application was rejected for the following reason: \"I am too good and authorities do not know how to handle me.\" They changed their answer, three months later, after I tried to convince several members of the National Assembly, to \"the project does not fit business criteria\".\n\nIn my previous attempts to find a job in the pandemic preparedness field, I was told (from a government stand point), in recruitment processes that \"only the government is allow to think about these things\", and that \"only the ideas proposed by the people on their committees are retained\". The last word was that these things were immature and not credible. A consultant firm, located outside the country, hired me as a pandemic analyst, and ended my term for lack of contracts, a similar situation that repeated itself with Government in the Lab (although this time, there was no money to hire me).\n\nI would like to be able to stop being out of the box. But it's too difficult. It seems impossible. After my 2 job training fails, <span><span>I was so</span> <span>discouraged</span> <span>with myself that </span></span>I saw a social therapist. She explained me about spiral development, and told me there was nothing wrong with my brain, nor my choices. I followed this path for a reason, that goes back to the day I left Architecture school at McGill University. She showed me that I did this for a good reason. She recommended me not to accept any job, just for the money. She said that it would be a bad idea to let go of my open government dreams. She suggested to go back to school a couple of years, do a masters or phd, the time that the situation at the government evolves. Uh. More school hey. <span><span>I have exhausted</span> <span>a large chunk of my savings</span><span>.</span> <span>Unfortunately, I can</span><span>not afford</span> <span>this option.</span></span>\n\n", "created_at": "2011-12-07 18:21:32", "updated_at": "2017-08-29 07:08:40.558915", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1132, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1287, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1254, "post_number": 1, "raw": "BRING ON THE ALLIES (Making a living Campaign)\n\nI think I can be described as a free standing being in terms of energy.

They probably think I am not very smart. For 90% of my professional life, they haven\u2019t been able to explain what I do. It started with my art work, and then it naturally extended to what I do for a living. I do not speak much, and I tend to be satisfied with people, the way they are (unconditional love).\n\nHusband\u00a0: left me the day the doctor signed me off work for 3 a month rest, during my pregnancy (when I became vulnerable, unable to take care of everything).\n\nMy big pale Golden Retriever dog has been my best companion these past 4 years. He\u2019s always happy to see me, jumps in an elegant frantic dance of joy, does zero whining and... doesn\u2019t talk.\n\nPeople who inspire me (without their necessarily being aware of it) play an important role in my life. I\u2019ve had a picture of the Dalai Lama and Ty Pennington (change agent from ABC, Extreme Make Over Edition) next to my computer for several years.\n\nSome of my inspiring models have joined my network (Dr Deepak Chopra), and they regularly encourage me (Lolly Daskal).\n\nSome authors are my mentors, even if they are dead. Baird T. Spalding has been a guide. I read quotes from Albert Einstein every day.\n\nPhilosophers and sociologists play a role too. I\u2019ve been reading essays as long as I can remember. I read almost all the books of Pascal Bruckner.\n\nI regularly consult with professional therapists: psychiatrist, psychologist, and social workers.\n\nArt has always been a great source of inspiration.\n\nBut my social media network has been my main source of support. I met a lot of great people, thanks to social media.\n\nIn the sphere of Flublogia, I had the opportunity to discuss with fantastic people like David Nabarro (Senior UN System Coordinator for Avian and Human Influenza at United Nations Headquarters in New York): he been a beacon for me.\n\nProeminent members of the \\#Leadfromwithin community, very positive minds, are of a considerable source of inspiration, like John_Paul, Tara Markus, MargotThompson, LollyDaskal, PDGProactivite, Strategiklead, Leadershipfreak, etc.\n\nNumerous government officials, and open government advocates, scattered all over the world, also encouraged me. Many have recommended me for jobs, have written me letters, introduced me to other people, have given me advice, etc.\n\nBut my main source of support, contentment, feedback, and yes \u2013 much bliss of my brain from great conversations -, certainly comes from open government people. A medal of kindness goes to<strong> John F Moore</strong> (also a very positive generous mind) and Adriel Hampton: without these two men, I do not know where I would be today.\n\n", "created_at": "2011-12-07 23:25:51", "updated_at": "2017-09-20 17:55:00.404065", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 648, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1341, "user_id": 23, "topic_id": 1308, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<em>We\u2019</em><em>d all like to vote for the best man, but he\u2019s never a candidate-Frank McKinney.</em>\n\nI joined the party (a local branch of a Romanian party) in the spring of 2008, but it was not this moment which was my first contact with party life. I was a student in Political Science, which motivated my decision to join in. I always thought parties should put into practice what the books said. Secondly, I chose an opposition party, because I thought being in the opposition would make it put all force and energy to identify the most efficient resources to reach its goal. But eventually it turned out the nature of politics is different from theory.\n\nBack to joining the party. I was starting from the bottom, with no kind of support. I participated in campaigning activities, worked almost 2 years as a volunteer for the party. The atmosphere seemed friendly and favorable. I didn\u2019t meet party leaders at these events, since as a beginner you don\u2019thave any voice. After 2 years I got a job in one of the youth party organizations. It became a faster pace. During these last years I noticed that elections are mostly pre-settled. Long before them, you used to know who will fill in those positions; this stands for all types of elections, no matter what level.\n\nThere would be, however, 3 more possibilities to gain access as a candidate: 1)\u00a0 2, maximum 3 places are kept for those members unsatisfied, but without the majority support; the majority is priorly taught into how to vote; 2) financial means, that is, if you can afford to support all sorts of party actions; 3) lastly,but secondary, is if you\u2019re the kind of person repeating everything you hear, loudly echoing what others are saying even when not understanding \u2013 the \u201dspeaking trumpet\u201d man; otherwise, you just leave yourself to the system and accept to be pushed away.\n\nVolunteering as a first level in the party hierarchy can sometimes turn into a job, but even at this level chances to chance or influence how things are going are minimum. There is a second level \u2013 people who own financial resources and can influence things. But they are interested to promote and help grow their own businesses. Although they\u2019re participating formally in decision making, in fact they\u2019re only interested in some things, and that\u2019s when they have a voice of their own.\n\nThe third level would be the board of directors. Important stuff is discussed here, positions are negotiated; also, quiet people are appreciated, those that don\u2019t go against the system. The party doesn\u2019t care much for its own critics. For 2 years and a half I could notice this from close. Some people here do have a possibility to change things, but these are risky. However, some proposals are appreciated, others are ignored. This level of decision-making either pulls away the whole party towards a good change or when bad decisions are made, they can ruin it for everybody.\n\nTo conclude, I haven\u2019t really met people in the party who put energy into winning votes. The functioning generally closely follows the national policy and directives. The principles are sometimes good but don\u2019t work how they should. One\u2019s opinions are not important no matter how well founded, the system doesn\u2019t let you make a difference.\n\nIn order for the young people\u2019s voice to be heard and respected in a party, a change is needed; just like Weber described it, a change towards a vocational aspect of politics and parties, but not as long as parties are setting to distribute positions and money benefits, in the absence of ethics. <em>I have came to the conclusion that politics is too serious a matter to be left to the politicians- Charles de Gaulle</em>\n\nAfter more than 4 years volunteering for the party, I\u2019ve reached a general conclusion: parties want \"their people\" \u2013 when you want change you\u2019re not \"their people\", you\u2019re not well intended, even when some appreciate your opinion. My advice for youth is to choose volunteering in non-governmental organizations, much more efficient and could change things towards the good of society. The chance to change something in a party as a young person is low, although sometime it\u2019s there. Although I\u2019ve worked for a political party, and now I\u2019m doing research in the political field, the party is no place where skilled youth should put their energy. I suggest following the American model and joining NGOs, use our energy to have a loud voice, to be a force when politics fail. This would be better for us, for society, for our towns and countries, for all.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-02-02 17:38:22", "updated_at": "2018-06-05 08:18:26.481645", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 829, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 55.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3596, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 3563, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<strong>1.

Khan has since quit his job in finance, is generously funded by Google and others and attracts 3.5 million monthly users. This mission is a test drive of KA as an education institution.\n\nI picked the above video on Conditional probability and combination (<a href=\"http://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/v/conditional-probability-and-combinations%E2%80%9D\">watch it in the KA website for Q&amp;As and goodies</a>). I picked this because:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>math is the traditional area of strength of KA, and a traditionally badly taught topic in many countries including mine.</li>\n\n<li>probability theory is a very interesting and useful part of math, but many, myself included, find it counterintuitive and need to make a conscious effort to teach themselves to think in probability conditional probability is a topic I have been taught at university, but that I am not at all confident with. This means I can compare classroom teaching with KA, while still needing to learn the damn thing.</li>\n\n</ul><h2>How I did it</h2>So how do you watch a video of a math lecture on the Internet? I armed myself with notepad and pens, just like in a normal classroom, and opted for a very active approach: this is math, and I like to scribble, not just to listen. As I dived in:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>I made extensive use of the pause button</strong>. Remember how you would scramble to keep up with the teacher? How you would need to make real-time decisions of whether to sit back and listen carefully (helps understanding) or scribbling frantically (helps memorizing) at any given time? That\u2019s gone in KA. You can do both: you listen, pause the video and write down your notes. Missed something? No problem, just backtrack. The video never gets tired of repeating, so you can replay it until you get it right.</li>\n\n<li>I took my time, and as a result spent <strong>about 30 mins to go through the video</strong> (which is only 17 mins), while still going through all the steps myself and checking that I was getting the same results as the teacher. That\u2019s super-cost effective, given that I am going through an example problem that combines conditional probability and combinatorics, with a great final two minutes of exploring the intuition of it at the end; and given that I spent no time at all traveling to a classroom. I guess that the one- or two-hour lessons we are accustomed to are the result of constraints imposed by the adoption of the classroom technology: teachers and students need to get there, take off their coats, take out their notes, find seats etc., and 15 mins are gone. At this point, you try to make the most of it by spending 40 to 100 minutes actually lecturing. KA videos use the topic, not the hour as a unit; most are 6 to 12 minutes long, at least in math.</li>\n\n<li><strong>what about questions</strong>? You can ask them in the comments. And people do, and other people answer them. The quality is amazing! Here\u2019s your peer-to-peer element in KA.</li>\n\n<li><strong>gamification</strong>: KA awards points and badges for taking lessons, asking and answering questions. I got a \u201cNice Listener\u201d badge for Probability because I watched more than 15 minutes of video in the same topic. :-)</li>\n\n<li><strong>added goodies</strong>: there are transcripts for the whole lecture; the community is also involved in sharing notes and creating the subtitles in different languages</li>\n\n</ul><h2>Results?</h2>Full success. Need to impress a girl with conditional probability and combination? I\u2019ve got you. Most importantly, if I should forget it and need it at some point in time, I know where it is, and I can refresh it in half an hour. And, man, Khan is an outstanding teacher. For the kind of learner that I am, this is way, way better than school, or even university.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-03-22 11:41:58", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:04.791066", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 738, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 35.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7393, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 4398, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>nice to meet you</b>\n\nHi Laura, welcome to Edgeryders!

This was considered to be a natural network of collective support. The demand for professional care health care, social care, day-care for children and elderly care seemed infinite, but the resources the economy allocates towards it clearly are not enough.\n\nIf we try to rationalize the system and extract more out of it, it only seems to dehumanize the people in need of care. The people in need of care end up getting treated like a number in a manufacturing plant. Is there a solution that combines access to modern science and technology whilst creating a more accessible and human touch of community provided care?\n\n<strong>Embracing a collective approach</strong>\n\nOpenCare offers a solution with promise of bridging the gap between mainstream health care and community health care through embracing a collective approach. Recently, being granted 1.6 million euro for research to design and prototype new care services that directly effects humanity\u2019s growth, expansion and well-being.\u00a0\n\nThe Opencare project started in the first quarter of 2016 and is preparing for execution. However, we hope to see results this year after the online platform has generated meaningful conversations and researchers have documented their findings. The call for participation to enter proposals in underway. \u00a0The vision behind OpenCare is an alternative to the way patients and health providers interact. Health and social welfare as we know it is broken, squeezed between rising costs and impersonality, if not dehumanisation, of their provided services. OpenCare aims at deploying collective intelligence to design, prototype and evaluate care services by communities, for communities.\n\nThe human right to health means that everyone has the right to the attainable standard of health and social care, which includes access to all medical services. Hospitals, clinics, medicines, and doctors\u2019 services must be accessible, available, acceptable, and of good quality for everyone, where and when needed. This is a logical solution to reform health care; by creating a system that is guided by universal access, availability, acceptability and quality. Whilst remaining transparent and non-discriminatory.\n\nThis is the typical pattern of acknowledging failure and trying to be constructive and do something about it that permeates the culture of so many dwellers of the edge of societies. With the assumption that state and private institutions will be unable to meet the demands for care in the 21st century and that new, more open, participatory, community-based methods are needed.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n<strong>Health and social care commands change in Europe</strong>\n\nWhat is health care? Who gives it? \"The state is the main health care provider\", say many Europeans. And sure, the welfare state is a major safety net in their societies. \"Business is the main health care provider\", reply many Americans. They have a point too: their insurance companies, hospitals and clinics \u2013 most of these are businesses.\n\nAnd yet, that's not the whole story. Health care models are failing: per capita health care expenditure is growing fast. We need to spend an ever-greater part of our resources just to stay well.\u00a0Pervasive healthcare technology is one of the methods for meeting the challenges of an aging population in many countries, as well as an expected major shortage of healthcare personnel.\n\n<strong>Collective intelligence brings wisdom to health care</strong>\n\nThe topic of health and social care is human and should be handled in a humane way. We want to understand how collective intelligence can be used to solve social and health care problems.\u00a0Clearly, the time has come to take a fresh look and an alternative approach to healthcare. This is not a question of injecting more technical know-how. The world is changing and we can\u2019t build walls around ourselves. We need to make space for new visions and create a fundamentally new approach to healthcare.\n\nThe OpenCare Research Project consortium consists of a partnership with The Scimpulse Foundation, Edgeryders, the University of Bordeaux, the City of Milan, WeMake, and the Stockholm School of Economics. \u00a0The consortium consists of members with different backgrounds, radical thinkers and doers, and just normal people that want to make a difference. With the support from the European Commission OpenCare is moving forward under the Horizon 2020 EU Research and Innovation programme. OpenCare - a solution on the horizon to access and humanize European Health Care.\n\nTo find out more about the OpenCare: <a href=\"/t/project/4861\">https://edgeryders.eu/en/opencare/project</a>\n\nJoin our Facebook community \u00a0<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/op3ncare/?fref=ts\">https://www.facebook.com/op3ncare</a>\n\nFollow us on Twitter:<a href=\"https://twitter.com/op3ncare\"> https://twitter.com/op3ncare</a>\n\nMaria Habets | \u00a02016 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/2/25498d8abf810bab005091367bb1c2f4b33a0858.png\" width=\"200\" height=\"51\">\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-05-30 14:47:29", "updated_at": "2018-05-26 04:37:45.026006", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 958, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25976, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 4766, "post_number": 13, "raw": "Even if you are \"a registered independent worker with a VAT position\", <em>usually</em> you will not have to put VAT on this invoice, since it is an <em>international</em> invoice (not within the European Union) for <em>services</em>.

Expecially because working with space and people requires full attention, observation and constant listening! \u00a0Working as waiter gave me the opportunity to notice that they were selling very bad food and a service not sustainable at all. So I suggested to the company to design\u00a0a new systemic approach of the entire chain. But they answered me that they were a start up and it wasn't the right economic time. In that moment i decided that I couldn't work anymore for someone I wasn't sharing some very important values with. I put together my own family creativities and we enjoyed a lot starting a very small business made in the way we really believe in. And we spread around our passion with small success (not only economic...you have to see people faces when they put in their mouth my mum's parmigiana!). At the same time I was running a project, creating a eco-hostel on the mountains but I gave up when for economic reasons I heard to say that the client chose me just because I was young, with no experience and so cheap! That was really a pity and it hurted me a lot beacuse of the efforts and passion I put on the project. But it gave me the idea and the strengh to evolve it and it has been becoming the new idea of taking people working in the nature. It is difficult to meet people that want to invest on young architect like me, with many ideas and innovative approach. They are scared. I have worked on many different projects satisfying clients needs investing my own money. Can you believe that I still have some money (very small amount now) that I saved when I was working in London? I was working there from 9am to 5 pm from monday to friday with a lot of free time but no satisfaction at all, without sharing values with the office. When they made me redounded it was one of the luckiest moment of my life even if it gave me a feeling of insecurity ( I was earning a lot of money ..for my normal standard). Now I am running my ideas, using all my energy, trying to transform ideas in reality, in order to help people connecting, collaborating and creating something that can be shared for the whole. That's my life now. And I really hope to find on the way, very soon, people that want to invest and help me develop part of this path. Shared experiences are easier and with more meaning! Let's make it real!\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2011-11-20 20:36:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:37.084715", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 683, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28517, "user_id": 120, "topic_id": 1479, "post_number": 11, "raw": "Hey!Yeah, these new online social platforms could be an alternative but as you said it's quite difficult to replace that feeling of 'togetherness' given by facebook.

The reason things like incense or candles or moonlight or what have you are often enlisted as ingredients in ritual is because they circumvent the mind and directly impact your senses to tell you that you have entered\u00a0are in a special space, not regular space. Ritual\u00a0immediately enlists the body, which we so often neglect when we conceive of our brilliant ideas and debate, defend, implement, etc etc. Whether it is yoga or meditation or guided meditation as in the core of this paritcular ritual, it is all the same process of getting out of the mind and allowing conversations with\u00a0the body and soul/spirit/heart to happen. And like yoga or meditation, the ritual I\u00a0proposed involves mostly\u00a0individual personal journey/ experience, not sharing or interacting, although there is one dance\u00a0at the end. I'd\u00a0envisioned doing it inside with a small interested group of perhaps 10-12 people, not processing through the town. But I would rather not, at this point. I certainly do\u00a0not want to offend the people of Matera or cause tensions between the unmonastery and the town.\n\nI have worked with many truly brilliant organizations and leaders over the last 10 years and it is often a challenge for them to step out of the intellectual mode and into a more visceral mode. Rituals work, that's why we keep falling back on them or experimenting with new ones, and dogmatic atheists would do well, as de Botton notes, to embrace some, somehow or other.\n\nI am an equal opportunity co-opter of rituals that work, whether they are originally Muslim or Native American or Christian or from my psychotherapist.\u00a0\n\nThis whole thread pains my heart a little, but I'm releasing that and determined to just come to Matera and listen and offer my reflections, as ever.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-10-24 11:06:39", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:34.616757", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 379, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32496, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3706, "post_number": 28, "raw": "<b>21 comments on T-shirts!</b>\n\nAnd 6, of which 3 my own, on a <a href=\"/monastery-vs-unmonastery-reflecting-on-a-deep-conversation-with-father#comment-13960\">thoughtful post on meeting a Benedictine superior</a> that it took two days to write, three to journey to, and several months to organise.

As a tribute to the community spirit Vinay mentioned, I'm backing off. No unMonastery fleeces are forthcoming.\n\nHowever, a word about licenses is in order.\u00a0A license is not some legal gibberish that a lawyer told you to put on your website. It is a social contract. An open license, says: here's something I made, come play with it! You are free to do as you wish, you will have essentially the same rights of access as me, its creator, because I trust you, whoever you are, <em>even if I have not met you yet</em>. Its purpose is to draw new people in, not to ensure a stable dominant position of the people already in. We have copyright for that, and it works.\n\nWhen you suddenly change the social contract, people get hurt. If you don't change it, but don't embrace it either, and treat it as some boring detail that the cool kids need not worry about,\u00a0people are at least wrongfooted and feel cheated. \u00a0\n\nA social contract is no joke. Where did you, Ola and Ben, get the idea that invoking it was a \"businesslike\", \"unemotional\", \"inappropriate\" response, contrary to \"the vision\"? This stuff is important to a lot of people. To Sam, who generously gave us the first batch of unMonastery videos during LOTE3: he spent <a href=\"http://yearofopensource.net/\">a year living his life using only open source tools and techniques</a>, going to considerable inconvenience. To Matthias, who generously built the Edgeryders website and runs it daily, and assembled a <a href=\"http://ma.juii.net/ma-documents/main/EarthOS.pdf\">800+ page document</a> containing open resources on everything from learning Spanish to <a href=\"/idea-how-to-build-a-diy-microwave-vaccum-dryer#comments\">vacuum drying with a microwave oven</a>. To Rysiek, who generously mobilized the Polish hackers to take up the fight against ACTA. To Asta and Amelia, who generously fought the fight in the European Parliament against the copyright lobby. To Simone, who generously co-started OpenStreetMap \u2013 without it, unTransit would have been impossible or illegal, because Google and Bing maps are not open. To Piersoft, who works to open building ownership data in Matera as well as mapping his city \u2013 and the two lead to a map of unused assets, which can be used by all because \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 it is open. To Marc, who spent his time in the unMonastery building an open version of something that already exists, the solar tracker, but is closed, and so when it breaks you can't fix it. It is important to the whole open source and open data movements, both well represented in Edgeryders \u2013 we fight for stuff to have certain kinds of licenses and not others, <em>because</em>\u00a0<em>different licenses encode different worlds.\u00a0</em>\n\nOn this, I do not see myself back off in the foreseeable future. Open is the only way I can even\u00a0<em>breathe;\u00a0</em>Edgeryders is going to take open very seriously as long as I am involved in it.\u00a0Anybody who wants to have a discussion about this in Matera is welcome (not a session, though, not worth it.

(Our share of volcanic activity in the Canary island of El Hierro was completely different: lots of media noise, loss of fishing and tourist activity, but no casualties or homelessness.)\n\nRegarding the roles of governments ...\n\n<span>I've done some work for my (regional) govt in resilience, very specifically regarding pandemic flu.</span> I can't talk about other people's opinions, but mine are my own, and as such I offer them.\n\nBob Dylan said something in 1964 that still resonates: <span>\"Come mothers and fathers througout the land, and don't criticize what you can't understand.</span><span> Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command - your old road is rapidly agin'.</span><span> Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand - for the times they are a-changin'.\"</span>\n\nSome parts of the govt are very specialised and may have resources (staff and stuff) and plans (to be used as resources = elements to improvise with, not rules to replace your thinking).\n\nMuch of the action is taken by citizens ourselves.\n\nThe role of the govt is (a) lend a hand, (b) get out of the way.\n\nThe nature of challenges is \"rapidly changing\". Govts have taken their time to learn how to react to fires and road accidents - so much so, that there are specific bodies trained to deal with that kind of issues, and kids in school practice walking slowly out the door if there's a fire alarm.\n\nHere we're talking about a disruptive earthquake in Europe, which is not such a frequent event. Or about the effects of economic hardship as in Greece, which is an event where the cause is still going on, and harm is still happening, and in which for part of the population part of the govt is part of the problem.\n\nSo what's a govt to do? How can we citizens help govts do better for us? That's what we'll be exploring over at the <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/resilience-session\">Resilience Session</a>. And of course has a lot to do with the commons, and with learning, and with this whole govts-citizens enchilada.\n\nFirst lesson is <strong>people can do things that govts are not (yet) agile enough to even envision, much less facilitate</strong>.\n\nSo what govts can do is run a <u>\"lessons learnt\"</u> session, and humbly admit what has worked well. Please, someone tell the Italian govts to do that, and to say what is it that they may think about contributing next time. If the \"lessons learnt\" session is done openly, then citizens themselves can add to the learning, and participate in it.\n\nHere's a lesson for us small guys: don't wait. Don't expect the govt, a slow-working dinosaur, to be as agile as we can be. We need to grow a culture of taking at least part of the work in our own hands. Easier said than done, but my sad guess is there'll be plenty of opportunities to practice.\n\nSecond thing is, <strong>govts can do things no-one else can</strong>. They have physical, personel and regulatory powers. Does the military count? They could do worse than look at <a href=\"http://www.star-tides.net\">http://www.star-tides.net</a> for information on what can be used in a catastrophe. As citizens, we could look into what we demand from them: stuff that's strictly in their power to do, and that they should be doing.\n\nIt's not a matter of politics or elections. The state has (is?) a set of organisations. Some organisations can do things we citizens can't do.\n\nThird thing is, <strong>govts can do things they themselves didn't even know they could do</strong>. They can facilitate the next one, open up conversations, put real risks on the table. Even when money becomes scarce, there are things govts can do. While on the \"money\" issue, we've identified four sets of actions:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Some that are very specific and costly. For a flu pandemic it was buying antiviral drugs, which are pretty useless in an earthquake.</li>\n\n<li>Some that are widely useful, but still costly. Having an alternative communication network that's good for all emergencies is an example.</li>\n\n<li>Some cost no money and are very specific. Get people to meet on what works and what doesn't work, and produce lively documentation that can be spread widely and save lives if and when needed. (An example with pandemic flu was looking at school closure. Not expensive to plan for, useful if needed.)</li>\n\n<li>Finally, you guessed it, the low-cost, widely useful stuff. The key example we can think of is EdgeRyders, and in general facilitation, but there's also some regulations, and probably other actions - which we'll have to think about, unless you already have some ideas.</li>\n\n</ul>Fourth thing is, and that's a rule in good old <a href=\"http://www.openspaceworld.com/users_guide.htm\">\"open space technology\" (which we'll be using in the weekend after days 14-15 June)</a>, <strong>\"if you're not learning or contributing, go somewhere else\"</strong>. How does a govt learn to \"just freaking get out of the way\" is probably an impossible task. So the kind way to suggest this is tell them to, well, <strong>focus</strong>. :-) But some examples of what _not_ to do might be, say, over-regulate, try to keep peace by force when nothing brings peace better than having food at the table, etc.\n\nFinally, a note on Lyne's \"open\" word. We need to have an open-content, commons, <strong>wiki</strong> for this. For pandemic flu there was fluwiki.info (a structured information space with a conversation space on the side, called newfluwiki2.com - a forum, really). For flu and other things there's towardsasaferworld.org (with David Nabarro of the United Nations). Is resilience.eu taken?\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-30 13:23:11", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:39.351876", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1079, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 10.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [9210], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1792, "user_id": 4922, "topic_id": 1759, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"imagecache-Featured\" src=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/sites/edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/files/imagecache/Featured/learn.jpg\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" title=\"photo by VanHallyn at flickr.com\"><strong>Education systems fail to deliver on their promise. </strong>Having educated citizens is a necessity for any thriving society: education creates human capital needed for social and economic development and for a long time policy-makers saw investment in education as an effective way to reduce inequality. Over the past fifty years education systems in  the developed world have grown more inclusive. Almost everybody has now a secondary school degree; 30% of citizens are university educated (<a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/document/2/0,3746,en_2649_39263238_48634114_1_1_1_1,00.html\">OECD</a>); the EU aims for 40% by 2020. Over 80% of European students are enrolled in public institutions.For all their past successes, education systems appear to be shaken to their core and in need of structural solutions:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>faced with budget cuts, governments reduce public spending on education. This risks making access harder and creating larger inequalities.</li>\n\n<li>a higher education diploma doesn\u2019t make one automatically employable, as used to be the case for our parents; this is particularly controversial in countries where the cost of education is high, such as United Kingdom.</li>\n\n<li>it is difficult to anticipate the labour market\u2019s future needs and build them into existing curricula. Many observers think there is a necessity of vocational education that fosters practical skills and can smooth transition to employment; they look at <a href=\"http://www.cedefop.europa.eu/EN/Files/8021_en.pdf\">Germany</a> as a positive example.</li>\n\n<li>traditional teaching and learning formats need to adapt to new ways of processing information; this is especially challenging given the <a href=\"http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/education/eurydice/documents/key_data_series/134EN.pdf\">reported</a> lack of qualified teachers, in addition to the teaching profession being less than appealing.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/sites/edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/files/oecd_stats.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"589\">\n\n<strong>Learning outside the classroom.</strong> Many have observed that it is not just formal education, but the skills acquired through lifelong learning that make us knowledgeable citizens, or bring whatever value we expect to get out of learning experiences - personal growth, marketable skills, entrepreneurial thinking, job experience etc. The European Union in particular has been very active in promoting lifelong learning, vocational training, transnational student mobility (with programmes like the popular Erasmus or Youth on the Move). On-the-job learning schemes are also being actively promoted, though unscrupulous employers tend to use interns as low-paid or unpaid labour instead. The European Parliament has tried to ameliorate this problem with a recent <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&amp;reference=P7-TA-2010-0262&amp;language=EN\">resolution</a> .\n\n<strong>Innovations in learning. </strong>Outside public policy space is emerging a new paradigm of learning models in which content delivery mechanisms are flexible, interactive and cost-effective. With the Internet potentially becoming the great <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/conversations/6037/is_the_internet_not_formal_ed.html\">new equalizer</a>, some talk about an<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/college-inc/post/guest-post-an-arab-spring-of-free-online-higher-education/2012/02/03/gIQAXiOFnQ_blog.html?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter\"> Arab Spring of higher education</a>, proposing a disintermediation of learning: replacing universities with cheaper technological tools that enable access to knowledge based on individual needs. Online courses, either free or low-cost, are coupling technological advances with the need to lower the cost of education: see the<a href=\"http://www.khanacademy.org/\"> Khan Academy</a> website hosting 3000 free educational videos or the <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2011/mitx-education-initiative-1219.html\">MITx courses</a> as innovative learning venues. These have grown to be more than experiments: as of November 2011 the Khan Academy had reached <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/19/khan-academy-triples-unique-users-to-3-5-million/\">3.5 million unique users per month</a>, with a 300% increase over 2010. Hacker- and Makerspaces, with their ad-hoc, intergenerational, trans-disciplinary approach to learning, are also <a href=\"http://npugh.co.uk/blog/spaces_for_learning/\">being proposed</a> as a general model for learning.\n\nWhat will take the place of tests, exams and marks for these online learning environments, so that students can be certified as having completed a curriculum? This is still a work in progress. Among others, The Mozilla Foundation launched its<a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Badges\"> Open Badges Project</a> as a proposal to systematically certify informal online learning and make it an equivalent to college degrees.\n\n<strong>Room for EdgeRyders. </strong>We set out to discover what knowledge, skills and values help us make the transition to rewarding adult lives. What learning aspirations and experiences are creating value for young people and should be counted in by policy designers?\n\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center\">Help the Council of Europe and the European Commission think\n\nabout the issue in new ways and come up with innovative policies!</h4>\n\n<strong>Good for you:</strong> Reflecting on this can bring to the surface new questions that you need to ask inorder to better connect your learning journey with your personal aspirations in life. For example,knowing that specific work requires specific competencies will push you towards redesigning your learning experience.\n\n<strong>Good for everyone: </strong>Your contribution can help others improve their transition from education to a rewarding adult life: if they know what skills are needed and valued in the contexts that appeal to them, they will know where to look for and how to grow those skills.\n\n \n\n<strong>Count me in!

I will start with saying that part of why we choose to use the type of media we are, including photos/internet/art, for this project is because we think it\u2019s the easiest and most effective way to reach a lot of people from different backgrounds. Since we are talking about alternate ways of viewing identity which claims certain amounts of thinking outside the box (system) - ness, I don\u2019t expect people to understand all levels of it at first sight. For me myself it nearly took 15 years... It\u2019s an on going project, and it's still at an early stage.\n\nThe idea is to fill \u201cthe library\u201d with tons of stories of the 2FACED1s, and then with tools of statistics be able to direct you, the reader, to the stories that will resonate with your life/your identity. But all the 2FACED1 stories are still important, since they showing a similar take on life/identity; it doesn\u2019t matter where your start (in a certain country, ethnicity, gender etc) - it\u2019s the journey, and the understanding of the own and other people\u2019s positions within a structure, double perspective, that is important.\n\nAt the moment we've hand picked interessting people that some of the us in the crew knows / know of, thanks to Internet and our own pop cultural networks with people from other parts of the world, the plan is to do shoots in other countries too. But it\u2019s really often that I read an article and just goes \u201cOMG this person is such a 2FACED1\u201d... \u00a0In the future I love more people to themselves contact us and telling their story,\u00a0 add another one perspective.\n\nMost of the current 2FACED1s every-day-appearance is a \u201clight\u201d version of the one they want to be perceived as in the photos, either because the\u2019ve just started the journey to what they dream of becoming but also because they maybe lack some of the tools to express it visually.\n\nImportant to know is also that FACE2 always contain a little something of the person too, otherwise it wouldn\u2019t be addressed as an antithesis at all, which you realize when thinking a bit about it. And usually each 2FACED1 has more than one character they\u2019re trying to stay away from.\n\n2. We just need to keep in mind that we are part of a system where we are seen as consumers in first hand and be aware that being a consumer goes hand in hand with stereotypes and stereotypical behaviours. I won't develop this thought here, cause it will take too long...\n\n3. In my way of seeing it you are not the norm in the society if you are a woman. If one breaks it down women has been labeled as \u201cthe other\u201d, a vessel that's been filled with everything opposite of what the idea of \u201cMan\u201d is, for centuries, just as every other minority up in a battle against the Norm. What I am criticising once again is the dichotomizing ways of viewing identity. And with that we are back on it; identity has to be more fluid.\n\nFor the ones actually being the Norm, we wish this person would see their own position in a structure and understand their privileges, like a true 2FACED1. It can be really hard on yourself esteem when you realize how your talents are based mostly on the cultural capital you got from mom\u2019s instead of some divine talent, but it will on the contrary increase the understanding for other peoples actions and situations, and give you a feeling of coherence. And finally, now you can start to think about what you really, really can achieve from your privileged platform, that also can be of good for other people.\n\nPs.Also see the 2FACED1 STATE OF MIND tag on my blog: http://2faced1.com/tags/2faced1/2faced1-state-mind\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-07 20:44:43", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:19.711276", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 698, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1710, "user_id": 14, "topic_id": 1677, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Based in the heart of Sheffield, Access Space is the UK\u2019s longest-running free internet learning centre, with thousands of participants making use of it every year \u2013 and it has achieved this without spending a penny on computers or software. Its model has inspired centres across Europe, while MetaReciclagem \u2013 a Brazilian initiative directly informed by Access Space \u2013 has now grown to a network of almost a hundred centres.\n\nI founded Access Space in 2000 - but I had the idea in 1996 - when I started an arts project called \"Redundant Technology Initiative\". I'm an artist, and I wanted to use my art practice to show the true situation in Sheffield, the city where I live. Sheffield has suffered structural problems from massive industrial change - the city used to be based on Coal mining and the Steel industry. Now the coal mines are closed, and the Steel mills are manned by robots. There is a very high level of unemployment in the city, and much of the employment that there is is in the public sector - most adults work for the government!\n\nWorking as an artist, I saw that the city was failing to adapt to the emerging information economy - South Yorkshire had the lowest uptake of information technology in the UK. Meanwhile, I was making art from trash that I found in skips. Not only was the trash free (yes!) it seemed to me to be the most suitable material with which to make art about urban decline.\n\nThen I started to find computers in the trash. I collected them, with the idea that I would make robot sculptures and other crazy artworks. I was amazed to discover, after some experimentation, that most of the PCs I recovered actually worked! I started to think about why people were throwing these machines away - when the city had a low level of engagement with information technology.\n\nSo I started an arts group, \"Redundant Technology Initiative\" with one rule - we would be the people who would be creative with trash computers. But ONLY trash computers! We would refuse to pay for any technology, and only use what we could get for free. (This was lucky, because me and my friends were unemployed or unpaid artists, and thus completely skint.) We had a few exhibitions, and each time we exhibited, people brought us more computers. Being artists, we made them into \"an art installation\". (Other people might think, with some justification, that what we had made was was just \"a huge pile\".)\n\nBy 1998 we had rented a warehouse which was scheduled for demolition. One good feature of industrial decline is that space is cheap. We had more than 1000 computers (!!!) some of which worked, some of which could work, and some of which were broken. We made a HUGE installation for a digital arts festival... and then more and more people gave us computers. After a few weeks we had more than 2000 machines.\n\nWe started to realise two things:\n\n(1) We didn't have any shortage of computers.\n\n(2) We did have a shortage of skill, expertise and creativity.\n\nWe learned how to rebuild and reprogram computers really fast, and we found students who also wanted to help. A local college sent us their trainees on \"work placement\" - and they learned as they helped us to repair the massive numbers of machines. But we then had a very embarrassing problem for an art group. We just weren't creative enough. We couldn't think of cool things to do with more than about 100 computers - we needed to think of cool things to do with 100 computers PER MONTH.\n\n<strong>So we designed \"Access Space\" - a digital lab where people can walk in and show us how they could be creative and productive with trash technology.</strong> It took 2 years to raise enugh money to start, and after we started, we managed to get ERDF funding to match our initial funds. (NOTE that there was no way we could have accessed ERDF funding with our levels of experience. We came in as a minor delivery partner, insulated from the frightening bureaucracy of the project by more experienced lead partners. This was very lucky for us - and could start a whole new conversation.)\n\nSo, in 2000 Access Space opened. We believed it would be a good model to help people get engaged with technology. We invite every visitor to define their OWN objectives with trash technology - it could be making images, sounds, music, robots, websites, designs, photo galleries... It could be building a business, making new networks, rebuilding computers, or whatever. Our key test is that people THEMSELVES set their agenda. We don't work with a curriculum. And we don't have teachers. Instead, we ask participants to help each other - and because they're all working on \"cool stuff\" not \"boring stuff\" then people are usually happy to help - and maybe gain ideas, skills and expertise from the experience.\n\nWe provide a free, open access digital lab, doing all sorts of things, from computer analysis, repair and recycling to art exhibitions, workshops, peer-learning activities, enterprise incubation, social support and more. We set up this lab as a response to unemployment, urban decline and the transformation of the job market. What we've established is an innovative methodology to invest time, not money, in ICTs. This has huge potential to address worklessness and lack of opportunities. It's worth reflecting that many of our participants in Access Space experience the kind of precarity which you are investigating with Edgeryders.\n\nAccess Space has a very wide range of participation.\n\n* If you split them into three groups, &lt;25years, 25-50years, &gt;50 years, then those groups are roughly similar in size.\n\n* Roughly 1/3 of our participants are from minority ethnic backgrounds.\n\n* Around 1/3 of our participants have a university education.\n\n* Almost 2/3 of our participants are unemployed, or under-employed.\n\n* Around 1/5 of our participants have some form of disability or long-term illness - particularly learning difficulties, like Asperger's Syndrome (associated with high intelligence) and mental health difficulties, such as depression.\n\n* 1/10 of our participants have a serious problem with housing. Either they're homeless, or they are living in insecure, or temporary accommodation.\n\nWe had more than 2000 people use the space in 2011, which added up to more than 12000 hours of usage. Helping and facilitating this number of people, particularly when some of them have difficulties, is a huge job.\n\n<strong>When it comes to funding, the significance of Access Space's budget is how small it is for the outcomes it delivers. </strong>Access Space principally sustains itself by saving money. A typical annual budget is only around \u00a3100K. We have survived by raising funds, and by saving money. We save around \u00a330000 each year by only using recycled computers and free, open source software. We have a very small core team (now usually 6, now 7 people, mostly part-time) who are on short-term contracts.\n\nOur special power with funding is the huge range of benefits that Access Space brings. We help people:\n\n* Make creative progress - by engaging with digital creativity.\n\n* Make technical progress - learning new high-tech skills.\n\n* Make social progress - by helping each other, and by working together, people learn crucial soft skills, and develop more useful networks.\n\n* Make progress with employability and enterprise. (These we see as the ultimate extension of all the types of progress people make.)\n\nThis means that we have a<strong> wide range of stakeholders</strong>. We have been funded to:\n\n* Increase high-tech skills for local enterprises.\n\n* Get people involved with the digital arts.\n\n* Help people become \"digitally included\".\n\n* Research and test new models for peer learning.\n\n* Develop and incubate micro-enterprises.\n\n* Develop high-tech skills with innovation potential.\n\n* Help people to become included in mainstream society, and become more employable.\n\n<strong>What do we want? </strong>Funding, of course! However, we are aware that models based on funding are becoming increasingly under pressure. So we have started a \"Friends\" scheme, to ask our participants, and anyone else who thinks that the free opportunities we deliver are a good thing, to contribute.\n\nBut we also need more participation by people who understand the challenge, and want to help. We want people who are interested to help us facilitate the community, build functioning social and economic networks, and experiment with how we can mobilise the talents and skills of the larger and larger number of unemployed people we encounter.\n\nWe realise now that the most valuable technology that is being discarded by our society is PEOPLE. We are seeing talented, skilled people unmobilised, and we think that this is a criminal waste. We also see deeply uninspiring, value-free jobs (like working in call centres) as the only structural answer put forward by mainstream business and industry, and we want people to work with us to develop more inspiring, creative, engaging, and socially valuable jobs as an alternative.\n\n<strong>We need:</strong>\n\n* More volunteers who are interested to work with a wide range of people, and are interested to challenge social exclusion and division.\n\n* Enterprising people who are interested in starting their own business and can see the potential to work in a social, creative and technical context.\n\n* Open source software enthusiasts who want to help us spread the word. We have a number of specific software and hardware challenges which we could use help with.\n\n* Other spaces across Europe who would like to collaborate with us to develop a network of social, technical and creative spaces. We have contacts already, but many spaces are just \"technical and social\" or \"creative and technical\" or \"social and creative\". We are looking for groups that want to be \"technical, social, AND creative\".\n\nThis would be the gist of what we're doing with this project. If you are passionate about techs and open source software, let me know and maybe we can collaborate.

The occasion was the need for blood by the grandmother of a friend. The inability to find blood in the hospital on the island of Lemnos, made me realize the problem. Through this incident, I realized that although all people have blood in them when someone needs it, it is too difficult to find.\n\nAt university, I found another two friends that helped me create Blood-e in 2014. We are all graduates of the department of Management Science &amp; Technology, each \u00a0one with a different specialization. Our training helped a lot as a starting point because we knew about the management of an organization, and how we can make use of new media and technologies. But we also encountered difficulties. It took us a lot of time at the beginning, to see how we can technology meet our purpose. Also, we were only 19 years old and, as students, we didn\u2019t know so much about the complexities of our cause. In times, it felt like we were on a ship in the middle of the storm, and didn\u2019t know where we were going.\n\nAll of us come from families that communicated the values of volunteering from a very \u00a0young age. Therefore our families were our first recruits. We started by organizing a series of blood donations in Athens and then created a digital <a href=\"http://bloode.org\">platform</a> where people who with a need for blood can notify suitable donors. Slowly, we started having a better understanding of how to motivate people and cultivate the culture of volunteering and donating.\n\nGreece is not the ideal environment to start something, but there are people in the public and private sectors that will listen and can help. Unfortunately, the legal framework for social entrepreneurship is very cloudy, resources are limited and opportunities for fundraising are minimal. There is, of course, huge bureaucracy, with regard to information about how to establish an entity. Over time, though, we have managed to overcome internal organizational issues, but also to find some resources to start our action.\n\nBlood-e has to do with the motivation to get someone out of the house and go give blood on a voluntary basis. Hence, we work with various organizations, communities and the National Centre for Blood Donation. We try to create synergies and collaborations, aiming to maximize the value and social impact of the project.\n\nBlood donations is an official responsibility of the Ministry of Health. The collection, testing and transfusion is only possible in public hospitals. When someone needs blood, he/she usually invites a relative or friend. Apart from the moral aspects, this also has some safety implications. When somebody gives blood with motivation other than volunteering, it is easier to lie to medical questions on medical history that made the donation. As a result, there are many patients who cannot find suitable blood, and receive infected blood.\n\nThrough Blood-e, human needs are met in real time. The donor knows where his/her blood goes. The contact with volunteers continues after the donation through the digital community, where everyone can find material on blood donation and blood. The environment in which someone gives blood is also important. Instead of the sterile hospital environment, we organise collections at working space, or along with friends. This generates an experience that people will want to repeat at some point in their life.\n\nCompared to these rates existing in the country, where only 50% of total blood needs are covered by voluntarily donations, we feel satisfied with the results of Blood-e. Certainly, it could be much better. We are trying to see what new things emerge, in order to create a culture around blood donation, aiming to grow the \u00a0rates of blood donations coming from volunteers, while striving to cover the needs.\n\nFrom the very beginning, there was a positive response from the public. Eighty percent of our volunteers are young, and give blood for the first time. in their life. We especially target young people and students, who have never given blood before. We are very satisfied with the response, which is not in line with the percentage of blood donated in the country. Our goal is doubling every six months the volunteer base that we have in our platform.\n\nWhat we propose is different and changes the mentality of the public hospitals. Our initial thought was to integrate this information system in the official health care system. This means that the hospitals would notify any needs, rather than the patients. This requires, of course, the collaboration of public hospitals.\n\nIn the future, we want to launch a series of games in schools for children. Beyond that, we wish to continue growing the number of volunteers. We approach this through partnerships with companies and organisations, which can unite our message, to strengthen voluntary blood donations.\n\nWhat is missing in our team, are people with a medical background, who are willing and want to engage with new technologies and such initiatives. Due to lack of resources, we cannot support more staff. Most young people also imagine themselves in a for-profit environment, rather than a social enterprise. They believe that either you have to be a volunteer, or to make money. Therefore it is difficult to find people who fit in our philosophy and our own needs.\n\nWe have a demanding job, where we talk with people who fight very difficult diseases and a blood donation might be their last hope. Especially when talking about platelets or bone marrow. Some of them die. In our everyday lives, we are facing very difficult circumstances. But the feeling that remains at the end of the day, is fulfilling for what we do and offer. This balances the psychological stress and bad feelings that arise in times.\n\nWithin Blood-e, we have created a philosophy of continuous education. We started something that we did not have the knowledge to implement, but eventually learned to do. As for skills, we have developed whatever has to do with digital marketing and communication and how to run a business. As well as the psychology of how to contact volunteers, patients and partners. Beyond that, we created a lot of soft skills. Namely, how to persevere, to have audacity and tolerance. To ignore those that say that \u201cthese things cannot be done\u201d, to respect that many partnerships will not be successful, but always keep on.\n\nThis is necessary for operating in a country that huge institutional gaps exist. Social entrepreneurship in Greece is a concept still quite unknown. There is no much public understanding of its benefits, but it is something that is slowly growing. What we do is to look at things with optimism. The country is missing optimistic voices, that -while recognizing that things are difficult- they strive to change things.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-20 13:12:27", "updated_at": "2018-05-24 13:11:19.115214", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1217, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20205, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 3906, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Reopening</b>\n\n(forgot that above)\n\n", "created_at": "2015-01-07 02:15:43", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:52.514613", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 8, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26230, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1298, "post_number": 11, "raw": "<b>Great idea, let's improve execution</b>\n\nI went in and played with the CommunityWalk map (by some miracle I remembered my login! I was using it in 2006, a couple of lives ago), adding Spaghetti Open Data. The idea is obviously appealing, and I would like to play ball. Before we launch into an all-out campaign, however, I would like to take a moment to wonder whether we can make it better. After my (admittedly short) test drive, here are my observations:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>Scope</strong>. Is \"Citizens for change\" too broad? That's almost everybody, from the Salvation Army to Anonymous and the people involved in the GOP primaries. It risks being supercrowded and losing cohesion and legibility. Also, and critically, it is not clear what could be the initial core of users that add stuff to it. You even included government initiatives like dati.italia.gov - hardly \"citizens\", and even the \"change\" card is played in an understated kind of way.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Location</strong>. So where is something like Spaghetti Open Data? On the Internet. Its address is its URL. Putting it on an actual map is not an intuitive exercise: there is no office, and given cloud computing we don't even know where the servers are. I ended up selecting the caf\u00e9 in Rome where it all began in 2010, but good luck to somebody who wants to talk to SOD and goes to that address!</li>\n\n<li><strong>Ontologies</strong>. Those who know me know that I have an issue with ontologies. I fully agree with Shirky that <a href=\"http://www.shirky.com/writings/ontology_overrated.html\">they are overrated</a>. Lyne's difficulties with finding a category that fits with her are a symptom of a global disease. Like Shirky, I find an approach by tags more realistic and appropriate.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Tool</strong>. I know we all have our pet tools and all that. Just curious: how deliberate was the choice of Community Walk? It is not the most intuitive tool of them all. The reason why I used it back then is exactly the color-coding of the markers, which makes for intuitive visualization when you are dealing with, well, ontologies. On top of that, it looks a bit derelict: it was one of the early movers on crowdsourced geotagging but now it looks exactly as it did in 2006, and I wonder even how long it can stay in business. The blog stops in August 2011.</li>\n\n</ol>Summing up: I propose John rethinks his idea a bit, in particular designing a pitch that we can push out, starting from Edgeryders. What exactly is this thing? Why should people collaborate? Once we are sure of what we are doing, and by what means, we roll it out. What does everyone think?\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-31 10:46:00", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:50.120372", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 481, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7859, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 2931, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Can you upload video into our youtube accounts post a link to it here?\n\n", "created_at": "2014-05-05 11:03:51", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:45.751675", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 16, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 10.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2095], "is_private": false}, {"id": 686, "user_id": 3310, "topic_id": 653, "post_number": 1, "raw": "The World Wide Web is increasingly useful to experiment, produce and research for identities, relations and objects in the field of \"Healthcare &amp; Innovation\" such as Open Source, Open Access, <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2015/547425/EPRS_STU%282015%29547425_EN.pdf\">3D printing and Additive manufacturing</a>, <a href=\"https://noharm.org/\">HCWH</a> (Health Care Without Harm), Augmented and Virtual Reality, Co-Working, <a href=\"http://www.jaycross.com/Workscaping.pdf\">Workscaping</a> and other important and emerging issues.

Ils ont peur de donner l\u2019ordre d\u2019abattre les murs \u00e9pais et opaques de leurs institutions pour les faire remplacer par du verre transparent, afin que tout le monde les voient \u00e0 l\u2019\u0153uvre, sans rideaux pour les cacher.\n\nPreuve justificative de ceci: avant m\u00eame de songer \u00e0 lib\u00e9rer des donn\u00e9es, ils dressent d\u2019abord la liste de ce qui n\u2019est pas lib\u00e9rable.\n\nIl arrive souvent que les projets exp\u00e9rimentaux de portails de donn\u00e9es ouvertes comportent peu d\u2019ensembles de donn\u00e9es \u00abnouvelles\u00bb. Par exemple, le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral du Canada a lib\u00e9r\u00e9 peu de ce type de donn\u00e9es, lorsqu\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 lanc\u00e9 un projet exp\u00e9rimental en mars 2011.\n\nDavid Eaves a fait ce constat: \"<em>Probably the most important thing about data.gc.ca is that it exists</em>.\"\n\n\"<em>The number of \"high value\" datasets is, relatively speaking, fairly limited</em>.\" (R\u00e9f.: Canada launches data.gc.ca, what works and what doesn\u2019t work, 17 mars 2011 <a href=\"http://eaves.ca/2011/03/17/canada-launches-data-gc-ca-what-works-and-what-is-broken/\">http://eaves.ca/2011/03/17/canada-launches-data-gc-ca-what-works-and-what-is-broken/</a> ).\n\nLe nombre d\u2019ensembles de donn\u00e9es de \u00abgrande valeur\u00bb sont, relativement parlant, assez limit\u00e9s. Cela revient \u00e0 dire que la plupart sont de peu d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat.\n\nPrenons un autre exemple. La ville de Rennes, en France, est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un pr\u00e9curseur en R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise, avec la lib\u00e9ration des donn\u00e9es du service v\u00e9lo STAR: disponibilit\u00e9 des v\u00e9los et des bornes, possibilit\u00e9s de paiement, actualit\u00e9s. (R\u00e9f.: Rennes et Keolis, ils ont os\u00e9! Libertic, 1er mars 2010 <a href=\"http://libertic.wordpress.com/2010/03/01/77/\">http://libertic.wordpress.com/2010/03/01/77/</a>).\n\nTant mieux s\u2019ils ont os\u00e9! Pourrait-on oser un peu plus que cela svp? Depuis mars 2010, des donn\u00e9es concernant le budget ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9es par Rennes. Il faudrait maintenant v\u00e9rifier et analyser si ces donn\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appropri\u00e9es par les citoyens, et si cela a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer la gestion administrative de cette municipalit\u00e9. (Entre vous et moi ---- j\u2019en doute fort.)\n\nIl est \u00c9VIDENT que des tentatives de donn\u00e9es ouvertes NE R\u00c9PONDENT PAS encore tout \u00e0 fait aux aspirations des citoyens. Il doit y avoir des milliers de probl\u00e9matiques, qui rel\u00e8vent de la responsabilit\u00e9 d\u2019un gouvernement, qui ne sont pas solutionn\u00e9es. Ne pourrait-on pas en prendre une, ne serait-ce qu\u2019une des moins criantes, pour tester un projet exp\u00e9rimental de gouvernement ouvert?\n\nJe reviens encore et toujours sur l\u2019exemple de Open Ideo. Cette plate-forme, a su int\u00e9grer dans un processus de participant et de collaboration, une place de choix \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9.\u00a0 <a href=\"http://www.openideo.com/\">http://www.openideo.com/</a> J'aimerais tellement voir un gouvernement oser mettre sur pied un projet semblable, et utiliser une plate-forme de ce genre, en la liant avec des ensembles de donn\u00e9es lib\u00e9r\u00e9es pour l\u2019exercice, et demander l'aide et la collaboration des citoyens.\n\nMais pour faire cela, il faudrait d\u2019abord reconna\u00eetre que la gestion gouvernementale n\u2019est pas parfaite, qu\u2019elle comporte des lacunes, et que les \u00e9quipes en places ne sont pas parvenues, \u00e0 elles seules, \u00e0 g\u00e9rer certains dossiers. Il faudrait par ailleurs que des dirigeants admettent qu\u2019ils pourraient avoir commis des erreurs, ou encore que le gouvernement ne poss\u00e8de pas toutes les r\u00e9ponses. Cela exigerait par cons\u00e9quent un grand acte d\u2019humilit\u00e9 de la part des dirigeants (qui ont peur de ne pas \u00eatre r\u00e9\u00e9lus s\u2019ils ne d\u00e9montrent pas qu'ils sont infaillibles). Et cela exigerait aussi que les dirigeants r\u00e9alisent que les citoyens ont des capacit\u00e9s et qu\u2019ils peuvent contribuer (trop souvent, les citoyens sont per\u00e7us comme des imb\u00e9ciles, ou encore comme des enfants qui sont incapables de penser par eux-m\u00eames).\n\nIl y a beaucoup d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments qui font obstacles au d\u00e9veloppement des donn\u00e9es ouvertes et du gouvernement ouvert. Cela revient toujours plus ou moins \u00e0 la peur du changement, ou encore est li\u00e9 au c\u00f4t\u00e9 sombre du pouvoir.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-21 17:26:10", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:59.833637", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 792, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14888, "user_id": 1687, "topic_id": 2270, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>thanks</b>\n\nThanks, Noemi!

Although I found most of the ideas in there quite characteristic of Edgeryders community as a whole, it made me think a lot about people that may also find it hard to recognize themselves in certain ways of making a living, or find that those ways are beyond their reach.. My understanding is that people aiming to have the freedom to choose their work by becoming self-employed or entrepreneurs are trailblazers, but not at all a sample of European youth. Recurrent (ad-hoc) solutions Edgeryders found are the ones we\u2019ve seen: self-employment, entrepreneurship, navigating different economies -alternative currencies e.g. bartering of skills.. they all require some creativity, open mindedness and a way to get around that\u2019s Edge Ryders specific.. am I wrong?\n\nFor those of us lacking the skills or readiness to create their own work setup are left with the normal directions of constructing a career, albeit an unconventional one and still a portofolio career \u2013 less focused, not hierarchical, and a degree of uncertainty which is structural, after all going for a career is risky in itself. Through portofolio careers we tend to develop some competencies that are harder to map and interdisciplinary skills that make us T shaped employees or hybrids (<a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/where-edgeryders-dare/mission_case/paid-work-challenges-path-forward\">Charanya was talking about it in this post</a>).\n\n<u>Personal example:</u> I\u2019m heading towards the end of a job which is only slightly connected to my university qualifications, and as I prepare for job hunting, I find it difficult to write a summary of who I am professionally, or even harder to define my profession: I am equally an early stage researcher in political sociology and a young online community builder. I have a university affiliation, but at the same time I am a communicator. I have 1-3 yrs experience in both, thus I am a learner still. The interdisciplinary competencies that I supposedly have are: peer learning, intercultural communicating, online content managing, thematic networking rather than just social. How can you sell this in traditional settings?\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>So my questions for you guys who recognize yourselves in this scenario is: how do we make the most out of a portofolio career? How do we make our path valuable from a market point of view, and recognized by potential employers? And are there ways of curating your curriculum by making sense of it and providing a direction, even a multidimensional one? \u00a0</strong>\n\nApparently some people in the <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/where-edgeryders-dare/mission_case/paid-work-challenges-path-forward\">Making a living session at LOTE</a> found as a general solution <strong>opening up dialogue, </strong>but what kind of framework can we use to do that? Conceptually and in view of some experiences detailed in here, I think this could be done by:\n\n\u00a0\n\n(personal strategies):\n\n<strong>- making a case for intrinsic motivation and passion, for the potential to learn that one has.\u00a0</strong>I think you can do this successfully in a job interview \u2013 I\u2019m a strong believer in charisma and one on one face interaction, but to get there you have to go through a recruitment process that\u2019s most often faulted. Which means you might have to\n\n-<strong>go around \u00a0formal \"job ad\" recruitment if needed.</strong> <em>You</em> <em>pick</em> your potential employers pool and be pro-active in pursuing a specific job with a specific offer of skills. Even when that job\u2019s not on the market yet. Curious if you have experience in this area.. ? I remember Alberto mentioning this strategy.\n\n-<strong>build up and be aware of your social capital outside the usual suspect allies like family and friends. </strong><a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/making-living-session/mission_case/making-living-and-social-networks\">Nadia\u2019s report on social networks</a> is a great reading of this and I distinctly remember what <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/making-living-session/mission_case/making-living-and-social-networks#comment-2829\">Ksenia said</a>: \u201csocial capital at the moment seems to be the safest currency\u201d; this one I find the hardest and I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s slightly innate.. but nevertheless there are quasi-professional networkers out there that improve their chances of getting work.\n\n(at societal level):\n\n- <strong>redefine the term JOB</strong> so as to move towards what we understand as PAID WORK: not necessarily long-term, not necessarily repetitive, not associated with routine, not associated with security. And while we do that we might think of ways to\n\n- <strong>improve the explanation and understanding of project based life-styles: </strong>what you do today may not be linked to what you do tomorrow\n\n\u00a0\n\nDo you have your own answers to the set of questions above? More importantly, how can something like this move towards the policy level? Or can it not? (I\u2019m asking this because for me personally, new funding approaches \u2013 Edgeryders one policy idea that\u2019s becoming more and more concrete - don\u2019t appear so useful; of course in the long run I may benefit by being hired by more open minded employers or people with interesting projects that understand where I come from and have the money to hire). \u00a0But I would suggest also coming up with a proposal that may invigorate current recruitment processes, by redefining the understanding of the meaning of job and competencies.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-07-04 15:05:13", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 00:30:23.787640", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1114, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 11.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27715, "user_id": 680, "topic_id": 1316, "post_number": 17, "raw": "<b>Bene</b>\n\nOk Maria Chiara, sentiamoci privatamente per definire meglio qualche dettaglio e poi ci riaggiornamo anche su questo spazio.

This prompted me to look into that particular piece of history in search for good stories and inspiration \u2013 therefore proving that you don't need to be religious to be inspired by the lives of the saints!\n\nI eschewed Francis (too charismatic for comfort) and zeroed in on St. Benedict, regarded by many as the founder of Western Monasticism. And sure enough, Benedict's life and times provide plenty of good advice to anybody wishing to start or join an unMonastery. Even a cursory glance will tell you that:\n\n<strong>1. Benedict was evidence-oriented</strong>. He did experiments and trusted their results. Far from being entrenched in his belief, he appears to be worlds away from a bureaucratic style of management: his leadership style is nothing if not adaptive. According to St. Gregory, he first tries to live in a cave as a hermit; later accepts to become the abbot of a monastery in the neighborhood, but does not do such a great job (\"the experiment failed: the monks tried to poison him\" \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02467b.htm\">source</a>); he then proceeds to establish his own first monastery at Subiaco, fragmenting the community of monks into 12 independent mini-monasteries of 12 monks each; later yet, he organizes the Monte Cassino monastery on completely different principles, with all monks under the same roof. Modern-day unMonasterians can do worse than copy his try-fail-mutate-iterate heuristics.\n\n<strong>2. Benedict valued and prioritized action</strong> over idle disputes. <em>Ora et labora,</em> pray and work, was his precept. Working is, for Benedict, the only possible path to a good, meaningful life; anything else has too much temptation and restlessness in it. When in doubt, his followers are given tools, shown a lawn to trim or a tree to fell and told to get on with it. Good, solid people don't set out to Change The World: that would be an arrogant stance, surely inspired by the devil (I'm looking at you, Silicon Valley). God can flatten any work of man at any moment by crashing a comet onto planet Earth or something, so Benedict's crew works for the inherent pleasure and meaning of making good, clever, beautiful things. This strategy ended up giving them (and the Western world) monasteries as centers of production, healing, learning and hospitality; monks came to be regarded as the Christian ideal. Nowadays, unMonasterians toil away to build hacks not because they really think they can defeat the apocalypse, but because it's the right thing to do and it's fun. And you never know, we could even win.\n\n<strong>3. Benedict protocolized</strong>. While at Monte Cassino, he writes the <a href=\"http://www.osb.org/rb/text/toc.html\">Rule</a> as a guide to people wishing to live together in a monastery. The Rule is really a remarkable document, that unMonasterians (especially those leading new settlements) would do well to spend some time brooding over. If you have any experience with online community management, you will find the Rule eerily familiar: it has roles with different levels of access and authorization (abbott, cellarer, brethren); a moderation policy to prevent flame wars from distracting monks for doing God's work (and their own); a very modern idea of the higher echelons as a <em>service</em> to the rank-and-file monks, rather than as their lords. Most importantly, the Rule does not specify a set of goals and activities to reach them: it never says \"build a library and a scriptorium and start copying manuscripts to preserve knowledge as the Roman Empire goes down in flames\", or \"build extra space to lodge travelers, since the Early Middle Ages are low on inns\". Yet, benedictine monasteries did end up doing those things and others: following the Rule can result in many outcomes, all beneficials from the point of view of Benedict and his crew. Most of them could not possibly have been foreseen by Benedict himself. Since it is a document of instructions, the Rule is software; since it does not carry out a specific task but enables a variety of mutually consistent outcomes, it is not an app. <strong>The Rule is a protocol</strong>. And what a protocol! It spread all over the world; arguably transformed (mostly for the better) Middle Ages Europe; is still in use after a millennium and a half; and has spread beyond the Catholic church (it is used in some Orthodox and even Lutheran contexts). I can't think of many other protocols with that kind of track record. Benedict may have been the Supreme Ninja Mage Lord Protocol Hacker of all time.\n\n<strong>4. Benedict decentralized</strong>. Consistently with the protocol nature of the Rule (and, one suspects, with his own mindset as a protocol hacker), Benedict never actually founded an order. Benedictines are not an order in a strict sense; each monastery is a sovereign institution, with no hierarchy among them. The Rule acts as a communication protocol across monasteries. As a result, many flavors of benedictine abbeys evolved over the centuries (for example the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camaldolese_Congregation\">Camaldolese</a>) by mutation and natural selection \u2013 this was explicitely enabled by the Rule, which declares itself as \"only a beginning\" in its final chapter, much in the fashion of TCP/IP being \"only a beginning\" for, say, video streaming. Mutation, however, did not always result in outright speciation. Most benedictine houses federated loosely into national or supra-national congregations starting in the early 14th century; and in fact Pope Leo XIII was able to establish a Benedictine Confederation chaired by an Abbott General without the whole thing blowing over. This happened in 1893 \u2013 1300+ years after the writing of the Rule!\n\n<strong>5. Benedict avoided sterile conflict \u2013 and so went viral</strong>. My research has been very amateurish \u2013 literally a day's project, but I could not find evidence of power struggles between the early monastic movement of the 6th century and the Church's hierarchy. Instead of going for Vatican politics, Benedict appears to have focused on running things at home in Monte Cassino and distributing copies of the Rule to whoever wanted one. As a result, more and more people adopted the Rule for their own monastery projects. This way, no one had to waste time negotiating who would be in whose order, who would be the Abbot General and who a second-echelon abbott and stuff like that. The Rule was (still is) good, solid, open source software. People obtained a copy and went about their way. People who used it were more likely to run a successful monastery than people who did not; and so, by the time of Charlemagne, all Europe was infrastructured with successful monasteries running on the Rule. Unlike what happened, say, to the Franciscans, there was no need to do politics to get the church to accept the new movement. Indeed, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Gregory_I\">Pope Gregory I the Great</a> (got the top job in 590, a mere 50 years after Benedict's death) was himself a monk and endorsed liberally monasticism (he is often called the co-founder of Western Monasticism). This adoption pattern will be familiar to the likes of (Linux's) Linus Torvalds and (Wikipedia's) Jimmy Wales.\n\nThere is something in studying the lives of saints, after all. UnMonasterians could do worse than devote some serious time in studying the benedictine ways as a protocol for societal impact in social innovation. This consists of the Rule (software), the physical arrangement of the monasteries and abbeys (for example, single cells for monks to sleep in are a part of the protocol governing monastic life that is encoded in stone walls rather than in the Rule), and the history of how it all played out. The church has had hagiography (literature on the lives of saints) for a long time as a path to inspiration, and it might be unMonasterians could use their own unHagiography. Something for a session at \\#LOTE3, maybe?", "created_at": "2013-09-03 06:42:41", "updated_at": "2018-07-31 22:14:29.657741", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1402, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 131.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1680], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3397, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3364, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a537a0e96b9b998be7c9b70ace32d0399c0e47e5.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"461\"><br>\n\nWe in Edgeryders do a great many things with technology, lifestyle, politics and just plain fun. \u00a0But where does it all go? Since we have no hierarchy and no formalized goals, it is not clear in which direction our activities and interactions are taking us.\n\nI am seeing a pattern. <strong>I think we are on our way to becoming the first-ever community to develop its own collective intelligence based on a proper data strategy</strong>. Let me unpack this statement.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Edgeryders is an engine of collective intelligence</h3>\n\nWe use open online conversations to explore issues and produce new knowledge around them. The idea is to seed a conversation on some issue of interest to people on the edge; place it on the Internet, where it is relatively simple and cheap to communicate; and throw the doors wide open for everybody to step in. Self-selection attracts people who are interested in the issue in question; skilful community management incentivizes high-quality contributions; and a large social media footprint helps recruit a continuous flow of new people. Then ethnographers go through the content and construct a synthesis of what is being said. <strong>This invariably produces surprises and important insights: the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.</strong> Collective intelligence is at work.\n\nWe have done this from the start. Here's the news: we are taking it to a whole new level. Both the technological and the human subsystems have undergone a major upgrade.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">The Edgeryders conversation is encoded in structured data</h3>\n\n<a href=\"/u/matthias\">@Matthias</a>\u00a0has come up with a way to enable ethnographic coding directly on the Edgeryders platform. It works like this: a researcher highlights a snippet of text and select an ethnographic tag from a drop-down menu of pre-loaded list of tags. This tells the software that this particular quotation is about, say, \u201cbicycle collective\u201d. The researchers visualize this text as bracketed between small triangles, color-coded for categories. Like this:\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5f8efa196064ff8b87f1a309132bc5ae3ef56931.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"432\"><br>\n\nSimple, right? And yet, <strong>this move transforms lumps of text on Edgeryders into well-structured qualitative data.</strong> Because:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>Content in Edgeryders is associated to people and to other content</strong>. Tagging it on the platform does not break those association links. Researchers can ask the database questions like \u201cshow me which participants are talking about, say, \"bicycle collective\" in an interactive conversation\u201d. This tells them whether the talk about bicycle collective tends to be in solitary rants (not much community validation) or in participated conversations (high community validation). Or they could want to know what else the same people mentioning \u201cbicycle collective\u201d are <em>also</em> talking about. Or whether there are clusters of people forming around <em>groups</em> of issues. When we have fully developed the tech, this will be way more powerful than standard software-powered ethnography.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Tags and categories are themselves database objects</strong>, and they are formed according to an algorithm that makes them compliant with a standard called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa\">RDFa</a>. <strong>That means our ethnographic codes are part of the Semantic Web</strong>. We may have our own SPARQL endpoint a year from now! And <em>that</em>, plus our open data policy, means that researchers anywhere can run their own analysis on our data, proposing new interpretations and enriching the conversation with them.</li>\n\n<li><strong>We have built social network analysis capacity and awareness</strong>. Thanks to <a href=\"http://edgeryders.edgesense.spazidigitali.com\">Edgesense</a> (a <a href=\"http://wikitalia.it\">Wikitalia</a> project), we now have real-time social network analysis of the whole Edgeryders conversation. This enables community managers to detect disconnected individuals and emerging clusters of conversation; plus, it augments semantic data. For example, network scientists consider a measure called eigenvector centrality to be a marker of authoritativeness in some circumstances. We can check for the eigenvector centrality value of people writing about \u201cbicycle collective\u201d, and give more weight to what they say.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/77c2de340e8e19daca88647e73366c9da36b0892.jpeg\" width=\"690\" height=\"295\"><br>\n\n<em>Network analysis in Edgeryders: The Spot The Future conversation (orange) shows structural coherence, while still connected to broader community</em>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Edgeryders are master collaborators</h3>\n\n<strong>Technology is nothing without the people driving it</strong>, and sure enough the world is full of empty platforms. In Edgeryders, we take great care of upholding a culture of collaboration and sharing. We do that because we are fully aware that most people in the community have very little in the way of money and power: <strong>the most precious resources the 99% can deploy towards our vision of change is each other</strong>. The ability to collaborate is a key enabler, perhaps <em>the</em> key enabler. So, we insist on tasks and issue tracking; we properly document offline meetings so that people who are not in the room are included and can jump on board at any time.\u00a0\n\n<strong>Our vision is to train each other to become the best collaborators/sharers in the world</strong>. Collaboration comes down to doing things that make <em>others</em> better and faster as we work towards a shared goal. One of those things is taking time to share some insights or information. If everyone around us does the same, we are all better off; but it is not easy to maintain such generous behavior. Like all humans, we are short on time, biased and lazy. In Edgeryders we try to incentivize collaboration by investing our own time to make people better at collaborating. We do <a href=\"/t/weekly-community-call/2778\">onboarding community</a> calls, <a href=\"/t/swarmcomms-harnessing-our-collective-online-presence-to-support-one-another/3154\">upskilling sessions</a> at our event and our world-famous Call a Human button (bottom of the home page). We are also working on an community-scale takeup of <a href=\"/makerfox\">Makerfox</a>, with its network barter algorithm, as a way to allocate tasks in massively collaborative efforts.\n\nThere is a price to pay for all this: we have to interact on the Edgeryders platform for the magic to happen. <strong>Fragments of conversation that default to email, or bleed onto Facebook, are lost, or sequestered in proprietary corporate datasets</strong>. They will still be analyzed, but the purpose of that analysis will be to profile you and sell you stuff. We cannot use them to make sense of it together. We cannot use them to generate results that we can package and sell, to pay for your expertise. They are back to being inert lumps of text, except where selling you stuff is concerned.\n\nPeople complain to us at times. They find Edgeryders big and messy, difficult to navigate, occasionally buggy. We work hard to hunt down bugs, improve user experience and keep good documentation, but let\u2019s face it: we will never be able to throw at the website amounts of manpower comparable to Facebook or Linkedin. You have to make some small extra efforts.

After exchanging some emails, I finally met Armine, one of the co-founders, as Vachagan the other founder is away till the end of July (I did ask him several key questions via email though). </em>\n\n<em>Armine was very positive and welcoming. She showed me UtopianLab which is located in an apartment turned into co-working space in a building located in the downtown Yerevan. They have 2 rooms with desks (around 15 spots in total) and a meeting room, which is isolated and convenient for making calls/conferences. </em>\n\n<em>UtopianLab started a year and half ago when Vachagan and Armine and Lilit (a former colleague of Vachagan) decided to create a special  place for freelancers to work and create. Vachagan was a Wikipedia editor since 2007 and he says most of the things he learned in life was through editing Wikipedia (not just reading). He co-founded Wikimedia Armenia (an NGO) in 2013, andit was a valuable experience that he also used later for co-founding Utopianlab. Wikimedia projects are also about sharing: sharing knowledge and media, while Utopianlab is about sharing workspace.</em>\n\n<em>Currently most of the members are using the space full time paying on a monthly basis and they are mostly males - freelance IT specialists, designers and translators except a couple of females, but Armine notes that it is changing slowly and more female freelance workers join the team.Trying to register in Armenia Utopian Lab is facing a dilemma, as they do not fit in any of the available formats suggested by consultants: they are neither an NGO, nor a foundation or a company as they do not have profit but would still have to pay taxes. </em>\n\n<em>The price for a monthly use of the space is some 45 Euros per person and Armine says they only manage to pay for their expenses - fees (rent. electricity, water, etc) and the credit they took to equip the space with Air Conditioning. As the space is small, they can not afford to hire someone to stay there all day, so each freelancer has a key and a free access during the whole day. As most members are full time, they all have their own desks and can leave their stuff there while the part time members share the tables.</em>\n\n<em>Armine told me they do not have an income and are doing this voluntarily as whatever they earn pays the communal fees, the rent and the credit they took from a bank to buy air conditioners and repair the place.There is also a kitchen where members can get tea, coffee and other drinks.</em>\n\n<strong>How you got started and current situation.</strong>\n\nVachagan: \u201cWe started Utopianlab in March 2014, but the process started in mid-2013. I had a full time job then, but wanted to be independent and do what I thought was meaningful. However I did not want to work from home or from a cafe, I wanted to have my own space as a professional which first seemed a little bit Utopian, until I heard about co-working spaces. Currently we have around 12 full/part time members and we are thinking of renting a bigger space but for the moment we haven\u2019t found anything affordable.\u201d\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/58113f40d96d2dafaf205029497733b6f76d3354.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"150\"><br>\n\n<small>Coworkers at UtopianLab. (Photographs: Lusine Bekaryan)</small>\n\n<strong>Who's involved:  Who is in the team? Roles and responsibilities? Skillsets (what are individual team members good at?)</strong>\n\nArmine: \u201dWe are basically doing everything alone with Vachagan. Vachagan is responsible for PR, general strategy and management while I take care of events and manage everyday activities. We used to have a paid employee who would help us but she left. Somehow we haven\u2019t yet found the right person with the right mindset.\u201d\n\n<strong>Any partnerships?</strong>\n\n\u201cWe do not have any long term partnerships but we do collaborate with some other projects during events.\u201d\n\n<strong>What your main objectives are/why you do this? </strong>\n\nVachagan: \u201cOur objective is to become a community of independent professionals. This we succeeded to do on a small scale, now the main objective is to move to a larger space where we can grow as a community, in the broad sense of the word 'grow'. This however seems to be quite a challenge for us, maybe even more difficult than starting the co-working space in the beginning.\u201d\n\n<strong>What you enjoy about the work and what you enjoy less? </strong>\n\nVachagan: \u201c I enjoy taking care of logistics, finding partners and friends, social/digital media, events, management. I think I enjoy everything I do for Utopianlab, I just don't have enough time for everything (I have a study and freelance jobs beside Utopianlab).\u201d\n\nArmine: \u201dI enjoy our diverse community of people, the fact that I can have a relatively free schedule. I enjoy less the bureaucracy connected with the formalities of registration of our project, the criticism of people who do not understand and accept what we do.\u201d\n\n<strong>What kinds of tasks do you do on a regular basis? Yearly, monthly, weekly, daily </strong>\n\n\u201cDaily: keeping the space clean, buying supplies. Sending news to members with our internal newsletter. Receiving guests or new members. \n\nWeekly: Updating website/social media. Discussing strategy and future plans with Armine. Research.\n\nMonthly/Yearly: Buying furniture. Relocation.\u201d\n\n<strong>What, other than money, do you think could help you in your work?</strong>\n\nVachagan: \u201cPeople (members, or friends/partners, or just visitors) who have a strong sense of community are very helpful. Those are people who come with interesting ideas and those are people who want to organize events which are in line with our values/vision. In fact we don't really need much money, the money that we generate with membership fees are more or less enough, our only problem is to have a space, and if we rent a space: to be able to pay the rent (that's when money becomes an issue).\u201d\n\n<strong>What help could you offer others and under which conditions (assuming no money is involved)?</strong>\n\n\u201cWe are open to exchange experience with similar projects from abroad, offer our connections and networks for collaboration. We can offer our space for meetings and events, as well as provide information about Armenia and promote Edgeryders\u2019 concept.\u201d\n\n<strong>How do you go about doing this- what steps are involved? Technologies or processes used?</strong>\n\n\u201cWe try to use as much open source as we can (mediawiki, WordPress, diaspora social network, jabber...). We also hope to convert to solar energy as soon as we can afford that (or at least buy solar heaters). Those are mostly my own preferences in life. As for now, there are not many technologies in Utopianlab, that I can tell about right now. I think that will come later, when we hopefully will expand.\u201d\n\n<strong>Costs: What expenses are involved? Who benefits from the work?</strong>\n\n\u201cWe pay the rent, electricity and other communal fees monthly. We also pay the credit we got in order to install air conditioning. Freelancers are the target audience benefiting from our work.\u201d\n\n<strong>Existing alternatives: Who else is doing similar or relevant work/offering similar things- locally and or elsewhere?</strong>\n\n\u201cThere are a few initiatives which are commercial (Eon, Loft) but those are not really co-working offices. In the past 1-2 year we saw a number of initiatives to open co-working spaces in Yerevan, most of them did not survive. I think Impact Hub will be an exception (they are expected to  open later this year and mainly focus on NGOs and entrepreneurs). \"\n\n<em>As Vachagan likes to say</em> \u201cCo-working spaces do not compete with each other but with the old-fashioned offices\u201d.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7c33e9005f90d718b8b0ab5b2c081b7f1625170e.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"153\"><br>\n\n<small>Comix: a comics event organized by Utopianlab. (Photographs: Lusine Bekaryan)</small>\n\n<strong>Important players affecting the work? (locally and internationally)</strong>\n\n\u201cAs for the local and international influences: this is a very broad question, all I can say is that we are a small community and we don't feel affected by other organizations yet. I think once we grow, we will get a better sense of that. I think, for instance, <a href=\"http://tumo.org/en/\">Tumo</a> will affect us hugely, because basically it prepares freelancers and creative professionals. IT companies will influences us as well: many of our current members worked many years in large IT companies and bring their experience to our coworking space. I think expats and repats in Armenia are going to be a community which will affect us as well: about one half of our members are from this community. They bring their experience and culture from other countries.\n\nWe also are in contact with some other local organizations in Armenia/Yerevan, who somehow influence, inspire us because they have a similar mission, like for instance<a href=\"http://www.techtension.am/\"> TechTension</a>, <a href=\"http://kolba.am/\">KolbaLabs</a>, Microsoft Innovation Center and others. Furthermore I visit co-working spaces abroad each year. And we also are in contact with<a href=\"http://cospot.ge/\"> CoSpot </a>a co-working space in Tbilisi\u201d\n\n<strong>Long term perspective: any Business or sustainability plan?</strong>\n\n\u201cWe see our future as a social enterprise. Important decisions might somehow change the business model we have now (low membership fees, payable for almost all freelancers in Armenia). In the near future we are also going to offer volunteer work for members who might be willing to do that and don't pay or pay less membership fee. We also hope to have a cafeteria that would cover some of our fees.\u201d\n\n<strong>Regulation and policy affecting this?</strong>\n\n\u201cWe have consulted several lawyers and we still can not decide which format suits us to register under as we do not have any profit now but we are not exactly an NGO or a foundation. \u201d\n\n<strong>What do you believe are the most important projects locally that are relevant to the work you are doing at this moment?</strong>\n\n\u201cThere is <a href=\"http://yerevan.impacthub.net/\">Impact Hub </a>collaborating mostly with NGOs.\u201d", "created_at": "2015-07-20 08:57:43", "updated_at": "2020-07-09 10:28:46.590844", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1775, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 20.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22791, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 2871, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>its ready</b>\n\nping <a href=\"/u/saidhamideh\">@saidhamideh</a>\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-29 16:24:23", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:06.706738", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 13, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 1.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [22525], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31544, "user_id": 2609, "topic_id": 4517, "post_number": 16, "raw": "<b>Yes, I'm coming!</b>\n\nHello,\n\nAs I discovered, the\u00a0workshop will give me the opportunity to meet persons who want to make the city more friendly for the people, so I'm looking forward to be there.\n\nSee you soon!\n\nAna\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-01 18:38:52", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:53.389977", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 52, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 1.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19517, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1303, "post_number": 10, "raw": "<b>Enterprise = revenues</b>\n\nYou say\u00a0 RAG is a social enterprise.

The facebook group is just one of the means/tools of the group. As a group, with the resources available for us and the main gaps identified at the national level, we focus on promotional and preventive care. We concentrate in this group, global and local evidence relevant for anyone to prevent cardiovascular diseases. \u00a0 Beyond the key \"theoretical\" principles of WHO, we try to find out, how to raise and to support the motivation of people to change sustainably their dangerous behaviors. There is a need to find the right balance between specificity (focus on the main purpose of the group) and attractivity (diversity of topics and angle of view, pictures, news etc..) in such a way that users have a feeling of distraction while they are exposed to the key messages of prevention of CVD. I perceive that in my context, Facebook is first of all used in for distractive purposes.\u00a0\n\nThe online facebook group, is not a tool for curative or palliative care such as online consultations with drug prescriptions. Medical doctors are involved in the discussions and if required, they can give offline, specific orientations to go for curative consultations; but discussions in the group, do not involve curative or palliative care.\n\n2- How do we collaborate? Online, each member has the right to share what matter for him, that is related to the focus of the group. This can be\u00a0a question, a picture, a video, a comment etc... The use of this right of free expression in such a group is not so high everytime of the year. If you scroll down further, you will find periods of high participation \u00a0on some specific subject with high interest and\u00a0later some period of low or no engagement. This depends on several factors, that we are still learning about. I attach to this comment a screenshot that presents a collaborative construction of an answer to a question raised in the group. I can send to you the whole power point if you want.\n\n3- Dealing with the traps of facebook, how? Facebook is the social media that lot of people use in sub-Saharan\u00a0Africa. The way they use it, seems to be more diversified and intensive than in Europe for instance. Other social media like twitter have a much lower audience in sub-Saharan Africa. So we use Facebook as an important collaborative platform in Coeur d'Or, with the risks that you mentioned including spams. The facilitation team has a critical role to cure the wall of the group. This team has to approve\u00a0all the primary posts, but can not approve comments before their publication. The team has, however, to be vigilant to remove all the inappropriate comments regularly. Private birthday posts are treated as not alway treated as inappropriate. We tolerate them some time for active members as a mean to reward them and to sustain their motivation to collaborate more in the group.\u00a0\n\n4- Offline events. We realized early in our learning process in the group, that online presence alone is not going to help us reaching our goals. We organize collaboratively offline events: physical activities (walks), risk factors screening, interactive conferences and\u00a0workshops. All those events are organized by members of the group. We use the online tools to recruit members who want to collaborate in the organization. We share with them some key principles and support. We use the online tools as well for advertisement of the events. The access to all the physical\u00a0event is free of charge. We use a collaborative process to raise the funding, using members of the group that has skills and key positions in potential funding structures. By doing so, we were capable of raising up to 25000 dollars in 2015 to organize physical events. This is happening in a context where the ministry of health do not have any internal budget for this kind of event. The local representation of WHO makes about 2000 dollars only available for this kind of event. In the organization of those offline events, community members hold\u00a0a lot of power in the process.\n\nWe still have a lot to learn, about this experience. Thanks for your attention. I'm very interested in learning from your reactions, analyses, and suggestions.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/2/2f15a353e15f4f5942a755fe733e2ba5812d020c.jpg\" width=\"678\" height=\"500\">\n\nThank you for being here with me.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-05-01 17:13:43", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:59.626998", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 816, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 10.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30492, "user_id": 243, "topic_id": 5044, "post_number": 16, "raw": "<b>sure </b>\n\nwould be great :-)\n\ndo you still have the extra ticket ?\n\nsome people ( actually many) are still looking\n\nping @ kate\u00a0\n\nit's just one ticket but hope it can help :-)\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-12-27 13:07:12", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:47.876102", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 46, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [30468], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17643, "user_id": 11, "topic_id": 1706, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Last but not least...</b>\n\nFor sure: I also want to thank Nadia for her reflections.\n\nAnd I hope that soon, from the Kyopol project, we will be making a contribution to address some of the issues Nadia mentions (agenda-setting, prototyping culture, institutional innovation, etc).\n\nkind regards,\n\np.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-09-19 11:32:10", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:38.452214", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 58, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16768, "user_id": 82, "topic_id": 1209, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Thanks for the\u00a0update.

It\u2019s called Edgesense and it\u2019s a Drupal module for social network analysis build by no others than @Alberto, @Luca Mearelli and the Wikitalia team. It runs on the Edgeryders database starting 2012 to date, and returns results in the form of network visualisations \u2013weekly captures of the network shape.\n\nSo I started by going to http://edgeryders.edgesense.spazidigitali.com/\n\nThe first thing you see is the slider to navigate the timeline of Edgeryders from its beginning \u2013 so two and a half years of network evolution. Click on the Lock red icon to enable zoom-and-drag on the network and untick the moderators box if you want to remove them from the network.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9e5e0255e0eac4d3a2ff49a5116b86ea1dacea5c.PNG\" width=\"498\" height=\"403\"><br>\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/f/fa6f44e8453aa4402856d17fda43dfd57f526ea4.PNG\" width=\"690\" height=\"414\"><br>\n\nOn the right you immediately see the key network terms helping you understand what you\u2019re looking at, with explanations available under the ? icons: <strong>Nodes</strong> are active users in the network. <strong>Edges</strong> are relationships between users, counted both when user A comments user B and viceversa. Edgeryders had 1200 registered users at the end of 2012, but only 260 active ones in the sense that they have written or received at least a comment. Today we have over 2000 registered and 400 active, so an average of 20% engaged, which is not at all bad for an online network.\n\nThe colors you see mark the emergent subcommunities \u2013 groups of people connected to each other more than they\u2019re connected to the rest. The degree to which subcommunities can be safely assumed to exist is measured under <strong>Modularity</strong>. The higher the coefficient between 0 and 1, the more specialized the subcommunities in the network (ours is 0.3). To date we see 6 big sub-communities, with Edgeryders 1 at the Council of Europe easily recognizable if you zoom in the light orange colored edges; same if you look closely at that in dark blue - Futurespotters.\n\nCheck out below how Futurespotters evolved from mid March when there was just me and disconnected members like Labanita or Ale Mambelli, who had yet begun to interact -&gt; to July, when we have a full fledged community, and country community builders (eg @Inge, @Hazem) are well immersed in the network.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/65279cd43c89065b334f770d7859eb0d0ebadd78.PNG\" width=\"436\" height=\"452\"><br>\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1db3570df71ca5a0968ddc9ad44ed5b635195caf.PNG\" width=\"466\" height=\"476\"><br>\n\nThe timelines below visualize posts, comments and shares of the two, divided by who wrote them: moderators and non-moderators in the network. The bigger the share of the content written by non-moderators, I\u2019d like to think that the more resilient our community is (not sure resilience falls under any term in network analysis?), because it\u2019s less dependent on moderators eg users like myself, Inge, Hazem etc. I\u2019m satisfied to see the share of community posts from 2013 to this year has been growing steadily (20%).\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/3728976dd77067ec0eab6b8dbef96eacae3d3655.PNG\" width=\"690\" height=\"260\"><br>\n\nIf you look at the upper right hand corner of the page you see a link to Tutorial, which contains 5 questions to help us learn to interpret network analytics. I got 4 out of 5 right, so I\u2019m pretty satisfied!\n\nKey take off points for me personally about Edgesense:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>A very intuitive tool to see network growth at clicks distance, especially for someone who doesn\u2019t understand the diversity of our thingy here that is Edgeryders. Navigation feels natural, a bit like child play.</li>\n\n<li>Lets one see emergent social dynamics - just by browsing the users you can see who is more central in the network and has more authoritativeness, or who is the broker type - the connector with other networks whose members might also enjoy being on Edgeryders</li>\n\n<li>It\u2019s especially useful for community managers who may not be well versed in network analysis \u2013 the tutorial is in fact a crash course helping us get the gist of the terminology and check points in 30 mins max.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThe above is more of an airplane view of what Edgesense shows, so don\u2019t count on it, rather take a tour yourself and see what you discover. BIG thanks to @Luca Mearelli, @Matthias and of course @Alberto for the <a href=\"/t/edgeryders-dev-testing/331/say-hi-to-edgesense\">efforts</a> to build and integrate it with Drupal \u2013 these guys have built a new drupal module!

Because they only make sense when you keep trying what you tried before, as otherwise you need other metrics. However failure in development is more often than not hinting that <em>you might be trying the wrong thing</em>. As a simplistic example, building strong social movements and civil society in Nepal is the <em>wrong thing</em> at the current time, as the first thing to deal with would be enabling a decent surplus in the rural economy that will grant villagers the time needed to engage deeply into civil society building. So metrics of movement building would be abandoned when understanding this \u2026\n\nIn the reflections that Noemi linked to, I argued for introducing network bartering in rural Nepal to grant some people a \"full-time equivalent job\" in movement building where monetary funding is not sufficient for that. I abandoned that idea, based on first-hand experiences in our project about how difficult introducing a digital platform is even in urban centers in Nepal. So, I learned from failure, right? Yes, seems like. But it won't be obvious, since I'll not publish the 60-80 ideas I abandoned in idea stage, and will instead fail <em>differently</em> with the next idea I think is great.\n\nSo the question remains, why won't I get it right about ideas for development? Why don't I simply learn from the failure of others? In my current view, because that's not \"simple\". It's not the stuff you can learn from books: you can't use a theory, but you need a truckload of experiences and memories to be able to explore in your mind if a certain idea would work in a certain development context. A theory only <em>really</em> helps to solve problems if you can use it for calculations. If we can ultimately have that for development, fine, but until then: How about \"immersive failure experiences\" \u2013 invite people to join the late stages of failing projects where it's about talking to locals, understanding the failure, and wrapping up. That's the brain fodder on which to build own expertise, without having to do <em>all</em> the work to create a failing project on your own :P\n\nExpertise in a development context means <em>understanding</em> the people you want to serve. How their mind works. Finally, close to five months after leaving Nepal, I made progress in trying to understand village people in Nepal. What helped? Talking to a friend who grew up in a small village in Nepal and made the transition to the West, now living in a major city for over a decade. She's expert in both cultures and could finally answer my questions. This would not have worked by me asking a local person in a village in Nepal. It needs somebody who became the expert by being exposed for a long time to both cultures, allowing to build a mental model of both from inside and outside of both cultures.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-01-23 03:28:06", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:13.529574", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 578, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [12657], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32769, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 4433, "post_number": 33, "raw": "<b>Could it be?</b>\n\nMaybe <a href=\"/t/title-missing/2219\">this</a> is what you're looking for <a href=\"/u/thejaymo\">@thejaymo</a>?\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-27 14:17:08", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:59.907651", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 36, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 6.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [32739], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27746, "user_id": 82, "topic_id": 1712, "post_number": 29, "raw": "<b>platform for a webinar</b>\n\nI been using this couple of times: http://www.blackboard.com/Platforms/Collaborate/Overview.aspx\n\nThere is a free demo.

The work that I do must be something that I enjoy doing. Usualy, I love my work so much that I do not even feel like it is work.\n\n<strong>CONTRIBUTE</strong>. In recent years, ever since I became a mom, my life has changed tremendously. I underwent a radical transformation, step by step. I was a chrysalis for 2-3 years, and I turned into a butterfly. People who knew me once no longer recognize me. I really changed a lot (inside), which means that the kind of work I would like to have also has changed. Contribute to society is now a big indispensable component of my life.\n\n<strong>POSITIVE MINDS</strong>. People around me are very important. After my divorce, I made considerable efforts to end all toxic relationships in my life. Negative people deplete energy. I promised myself not to allow the creation of negativity in my environment. Therefore, I look for people with positive attitudes, positive minds. \u00a0\n\n<strong>INTEGRITY</strong>. \u00a0\"<em>There can be no enthusiasm in anything that you are promoting, projecting, planning, or striving toward unless it has total intergrity</em>.\" (Robert H. Schuller, <em>The Peak to Peek Principle) </em>It makes no sense for me to promote transparency and collaboration, if there is a lack of integrity. I prefer environments where people are guided by core values: compassion, love, loyalty, honesty, integrity.\n\n<strong>GOOD LISTENING</strong>. I find that there can be not real collaboration if listening isn\u2019t there: people showing empathy, understanding the context of the other person and listening from all levels (body, mind, heart, and soul). This means look and listen to situations, but also look and listen inside.\n\n<strong>EMOTIONALLY CLOSENESS</strong>. \"<em>Empathy, the capacity to feel with another in his suffering, is born first of awareness, then of sympathetic connection</em>.\" (Daphne Rose Kingma, <em>The Men We Never Knew) </em>I look for shared enthusiasm, genuine caring for others, willingness to build a relationship, reinforcing the strenghts of others, increasing self-esteem of others.\n\n<strong>CREATIVITY</strong>. I must admire what the group stands for. The rules are loose enough for me to breathe. I am appreciated. There is minimal pressure to conform. Things are not too organized. People are having fun around me. New ideas excite those in charge. New ideas move up the ladder quickly. I am allowed to be independant in choosing assignments. \u00a0\n\nWHAT I DID TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES\n\n<strong>I AM PASSION. </strong><strong>I don\u2019t let the train of life pass by me. I mean to board it\u2026 and I want to contribute to make a better world. With passion, obstacles, challenges and adversities only make the journey more exciting and accomplishments become even more thrilling. </strong>Passion helps me search for the deeper meaning in everything I do. I learn from sorrows: I don\u2019t get roasted in suffering. I learned to develop awareness of the pain, track it down to the learning hidden in its roots, and persevere to take appropriate action to leap out of it. Kundalini has been a real blessing for me, because no-thing seems to affect me anymore: I found a way to conserve passion.\n\n<strong>I DESERVE IT</strong>. I believe that this universe has only one purpose: to plant desires in our mind and help us to fulfill them. My dreams are good dreams. I deserve to see them fulfilled. I tell myself that I deserve to be given whatever I ask for! I want to believe\u2026\n\n<strong>I BALANCE BEING &amp; DOING</strong>. They constitute an inseparable whole for me. I like being a lot, but I am attracted to people who like doing a lot (like John F Moore, for instance, we have complementary skills). The more I am with my being, the more clarity I get about what I am. The more clarity I develop, the more conviction I grow about why I am here, and what I ought to be doing with my life. On a scale of one to ten, I give this a 10.\n\n<strong>I AIM HIGH</strong>. So many people tell me to aim low. It bothers me. I would like to undertake only jobs/projects that are high-scoring and highly meaningful. I think big!\n\nTHE ROADBLOCKS STANDING IN THE WAY\n\nUh. So depressing to answer\u2026 The list is way too long. When is it gonna end? How will it ever go away?\n\nRisk aversion, locking processes, fear of the unknown, power-hungry leaders, excessive control, lack of awareness, <strong>design flaws that discourage public utilization and engagement, corruption and non-transparent rules, culture of silence, </strong>governments who see open government as a threat, <strong>legal constraints </strong>limiting the ability to create tools and services useful to the public, public distrust.\n\nLack of open government market, very little job opportunities in this field.\n\n", "created_at": "2011-12-08 04:01:08", "updated_at": "2017-08-29 07:03:27.928575", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 877, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25499, "user_id": 1839, "topic_id": 2470, "post_number": 19, "raw": "<span>\"\u00a0got someone in the European Commission\" - thats really right direction.

Chase Buzz terms: Try new technologies out and become proficient at using them\n\n2. Do temporary jobs to pay rent and bills (how much do you need/ month &amp; what\u2019s minimum wage?)\n\n3. Experiment with different forms of self-expression to tell stories about who you are and the worlds you live in till you find your style that resonates with more people- especially writing. Pick something which you can do consistently over a long period of time so people can find you and you can develop an audience: \u201cIt's about taking control and responsibility for your activities and presence and not complaining that the system doesn't let you do that - forget the system, I'll make my own way\u201d\n\n4. Be open and social: make it easy for others who might be interested in what you do to find and engage with you. Pete did it by telling people where he would be on a regular basis and inviting people to come meet him there to talk about social media, offering to help newbies get started, or those curious to explore it a bit without a major commitment.\n\nOk so it seems you can make a living by doing a combination of temporary work to pay the bills and creative exploration of your environment to move you forward in the long run. My big question here has to do the time frame- Cash in hand, Short term, medium term, long term work- Highly specialised or skilled vs generic, specific vs fuzzy descriptions. How to find it as individual, as group as community? I\u2019ll take my own example: At a certain point in my working life I ended up working as a cook in restaurants. I only did it for a while, and didn\u2019t have any professional training- but I did get it through a job centre. Turns out the job itself was over hyped- all it really required was that you show up, peel a lot of vegetables, heat and serve pre-processes foods and clean up meticulously after each working day. The job description made it out to be a highly demanding job requiring specialist skills but it really wasn\u2019t, they could just have said: We\u2019re looking for person to mostly prepare pre-processed foods and a couple of salads every now and then. You need to be clean, have high work ethic and be willing to do repetitive tasks but on the upside the money\u2019s not bad. There is no way from the description I could have guessed what it was about, and if they had asked about qualifications I would have been filtered out as a candidate even though the job certainly didn\u2019t require it. Long term is off- I don\u2019t believe it is possible to plan long term anymore, not when it comes to paid work. So I am asking myself what cash in hand or short term work is out there? Babysitting, gardening, selling stuff on the beach. There never seem to be enough plumbers and electricians around. Especially at odd hours. And Estheticians/ they often seem to be booked days or even weeks in advance. Any more? What kinds of odd jobs have you done in the past and how did you get them?\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-28 20:55:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:55.409934", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 601, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3386, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 3353, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-full\" style=\"margin-top: 1.7em; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 23px; background-color: rgb(255, 244, 244);\">\n\n<div class=\"field-items\">\n\n<div class=\"field-item even\">\n\nWe're really outdoing ourselves with the fourth edition of \\#LOTE, the annual gathering of Edgeryders from around the globe.

I think that is especially true in the online world.\u00a0\n\nThe way we educate our children definitely needs a thorough overview and a prompt change. Although reforming the system of education will not only require transforming relevant legislations, curriculum, retraining of teachers and changing habits of schools but also changing habits of politicians and actually of all citizens :) \u00a0\n\nWe have a good track record of identifying the differences and thus we tend to develop an identity of being different than others which is many times interpreted as a \"bad thing\" in Europe. Our history has shifted us towards this approach.\n\nOne of the toughest habits I have been coming across as a child as well as a father of three is discrimination in school. The current educational system and the educational methodology used provides a real chance to less than 1% of all Roma/Gypsy children. Extreme right wing thinkers argue it's for the bad genes Roma/Gypsy (hereinafter referred to as 'Roma') have and when it comes to judging Roma than 6 to 8 ppl out of ten would think alike irrespective of political, religious background in all Central and Eastern European states. The same applies to media too.\n\nThe very first thing a Roma child is confronted with on the first school day in his/her life is that s/he is different, comes from a criminal group that lies, cheats and is stinky. These are the first attributes associated to our ethnic group. So how enthusiastic will you be with any kind of reform when you get this from school mates and many teachers also contribute to deepening the stereotypes against Roma kids in the class (Roma children sit in the last row in the class, they have a permission to miss out certain classes so they do not disturb the others, Roma children are overrepresented in special schools for physically and mentally disabled children etc.).\n\nSo I am definitely FOR changing the educational system but it should be done in a way where stereotypes are challenged and kids are completing projects in groups where they are always asked to join new and new groups.\n\nJust to show you guys how deep stereotypes are, check out <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peCv90NYoSY\">this video</a>. THis is 'Robika', a 7 year old Roma kid who just got featured in the Hungarian version of the x-factor talent program. In the last couple of days, he's been receiving a vast number of racist comments from tens of thousands of people across the country. Now you can imagine what this kid may expect to receive from the other pupils when walking in the classroom on his first school day.\n\n-----------------------\n\nP.S.

Building our own tools. Potential is we could end up iwith community which can share resources without need of finances in order to realise projects Explanation step by step how we do this. Ruxandra: Im enthusiastic because thinking about brainstorm at ouishare and it's cool it's becoming a reality. putting it into action is difficult but normal for creative projects Rux: if you want to participate in lote you need to be more involved. do something for organissation. Create your ticket on makerfox and then based on actions you get your ticket. 1. go on the edgeryders site look at tasks to be done 2. register for difft teams 3. then go on makerfox and create account, make same account s you have on Edgeryders.E.g. rucxandra has this account of edgeryders, and this is account makerfox.\n\nNoemi Salantiu 11:37 I've listed on each task on Edgeryders: value of ticket: 1/2; or 1/3 or 1 lote3 ticket\n\nme 11:37 4. Then buy ticket. 5. The more tasks you do on edgeryders, the more makerbux edgeryders community managers give you on platform. I don't completely understand the takss: it needs to be more clear what to do...e.g. who has to twewet, who has to curate...the tasks need to be more clear: who, how what where\n\nDorotea Mar 11:39 agree about the currency name too\n\nme 11:39 Makercoins default currency\n\nDorotea Mar 11:39 I just created a makerfox account and ordered the ticket works smoothly\n\nme 11:40 the reason we have dollars is because people take time to get used to a new currency\n\nBen: what if it said 1000USD/1000 Makercoins Market logic - Scarcity Logic: Maker coin logic Makercoin logic= Market logic - Scarcity logic + social logic Ben Vickers 11:46 silence = yes?\n\nme 11:46 LOTE Logic.\n\nMatthias Ansorg 11:46 lotic Ben Vickers 11:47 tricky i think you do that through groups and communites that use the platform i.e barter parties on others services when people give away fridges to their neighbours on grindr\n\nme 11:48 Can we make the logic for any project/ trader explicit and visible?\n\nMatthias Ansorg 11:48 that's social agreements to put on Edgeryders platform, no?\n\nme 11:49 social protols! protocols\n\nRuxandra Creosteanu 11:49 I agree with Matthias\n\nme 11:50 If people don't do the pre-event tasks but show up, they can do the on location tasks Latecomer tasks: documentation, setting up charis, cooking, cleaning\n\nNoemi Salantiu 11:52 @Lauren: https://edgeryders.eu/task-3553 me 11:54 get rid of video? I dont understand can you give an example?\n\nDorotea Mar 11:55 one idea is that maybe people could propose the task if there is not enough tasks or someone just wants to propose something different me 11:56 E,.g You're doing fundraising, it takes time, it generates value. Can you add it to the tasks? Matthias: usually tasks set up by LOTE4 team ccordinators\n\nDorotea Mar 11:56 yes this is more engaging for the community\n\nme 11:57 @Noemi: we need to create a task for team coordinators! Ben: I get the impression there are a lot of people eager to get involved, and eager but are struggling. They see a task, not sure if it's still active, not clear how to do it.\n\nMatthias Ansorg 12:00 /t/lote4-the-stewardship/359-dashboard\n\nDorotea Mar 12:00 some people like to take on the tasks, some people prefer to define their own tasks, we can open the door to both kinds of contributions , yes call a human is a great way to unconfuse confused people who have motivation to be involved and contribute me 12:00 SO how can we communicate ? Interested? Not sure what to do?: 1. Add a Call a human Block on every task. 2. Create overview of what you can do and what is it's status\n\nBen Vickers 12:01 Place 'Not sure how to get involved, but want to help, call a human, or comment on this post'\n\nme 12:01 3. Weekly google hangout / team\n\nDorotea Mar 12:01 something like 'github' for tasks - whats the status , whos involved\n\nMatthias Ansorg 12:02 yep you can assignto multiple people\n\nme 12:04 4. Connect each team page to the tasks: On each team page add list of tasks (just copy paste from the lote tasks wiki )\n\nBen Vickers 12:05 Another suggested quick fix, on 'Join a team' page, have an explanation of steps to getting involved. 1. Want to get involved and work on LOTE4? The quickest route is to join a team and pick up a task. 2. Tasks can be found here, if a task isn't already assigned to someone, assign it to yourself. If you're not sure the status of something, comment and @noemi or someone else will get back to you. 3. You can also create new tasks and take the lead on doing the work that you think is it important. 4. LOTE4 like EdgeRyders is driven by social interaction, things only become active when you post, EdgeRyders is a 'No Spectators Sport' - if you think something should happen, drive it and others will likely join you. 5. If you get really stuck, Call a human.\n\nDorotea Mar 12:05 ok i can volunteer to check if people want to show up in those calls and motivate people to contribute : )\n\nNoemi Salantiu 12:06 I disagree with large no. of calls 1 weekly call every thursday - Q&amp;A, working together, human etc\n\nme 12:06 Nothing happens until you say something on edgeryders. In a comment. Then people say something back. NOW THE TOUR: Lauren is taking the lead, others go to other places, and then meetup in some places August and September. Needs 1. Engage people to fill in the spreadsheets to get overview and plan som routes.\n\nBen Vickers 12:09 https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cov7n7xqqQbGYRqUSQxHd-3ksrBfbRUrVdYFL8lPoOg/edit#gid=0\n\nme 12:09 2. Produce an interview template so we can get one cuts video shots\n\nBen Vickers 12:10 https://edgeryders.eu/interview-framework-for-case-studies-adventure me 12:13 In next 48 hours. Good examples of projects that make a good tour route. These are the key 5-6 projects that bring you to each project. Simple call to action: Each person in call sends out personal emails with link to spredsheet asking them to fill in 3 key projects. Ok, Noemi can we send out a newsletter with a call to action on this? Other need video production: Sam and Nico need to help with concept, filing directions, equipment suggestions. http://europetour.ouishare.net/ Dorotea Mar left group chat.\n\nme 12:16 Set up events on FB in all the cities, get people to invite more people Dorotea Mar joined group chat.\n\nDorotea Mar left group chat.\n\nRuxandra Creosteanu 12:17 I will have to leave. Sorry for leaving before the conf call ended, was great! And things are more clear now, and they will become more and more.\n\nRuxandra Creosteanu left group chat. Dorotea Mar joined group chat.\n\nme 12:21 IN parallel to setting up stewardship FB events in different Discussing Stewardship hangouts: 1. Calls with the curators: could be very simple, hangout...or display some of the interviews. Structured (4 people) 3 minutes this is what my project is about. IM ben, ive been doing x or x time, these are key things we're tacking, these are questions Im asking. People invited: People we meet on the tour, Curators, community. Nadia goes to Detroit. Find out what they really think about stewardship\n\nBen Vickers 12:26 STEWARDSHIP SUMMITS ?\n\nAlberto Cottica 12:26 Nice\n\nme 12:27 Stewardship Summits: Lauren had something written up in a proposal something about a tv show we dont need to do totally open. This can be small and intimate. On demand.\n\nBen Vickers 12:32 1. Case Study Adventures 1. Case Study Adventures Matthias Ansorg 12:33 ((I'm about to leave, will care for LOTE4 task list and Makercoin price tags from Sunday on))\n\nNoemi Salantiu 12:33 guys I gotta run. talk soon! happy holiday Matt\n\nAlberto Cottica 12:34 Matt, can you open your personal chat? I got a question\n\nMatthias Ansorg 12:34 sure\n\nNoemi Salantiu left group chat.\n\nAlberto Cottica 12:35\n\nMatt: posted on GChat 20.00 people it in my part of the world Matthias Ansorg left group chat.\n\nAlberto Cottica 12:37 9/11 It's ok, guys\n\nBen Vickers 12:40 1. Case Study Adventures / involves: itinerant travel, meetups in each city, short interviews, 2.

Guess I should speak up here :)</b>\n\nTaking part in the subtitling exercise was a useful excuse for me to learn a new tool: <a href=\"http://www.amara.org/en/\">Amara</a>, the subtitling tool I had heard about but never used. Would I be supposed to help with subtitling regularly, it is just as you say:\n\n<em>\"The main roadblock is, as often with open networks, that it is hard to come up with an a priori way to incentivize and compensate participants.\"</em>\n\nEnabling compensation for P2P support in cash-scarce environments is exactly what we try to solve with <a href=\"/economy-app\">Economy App</a>. With its first public release coming up in January or February (see <a href=\"/economy-app/breakthrough-in-algorithm-development\">latest progress</a>), it may be a good time to evaluate a collaboration. Edgeryders is a very attractive first user community for the Economy App since they are (1) tech savvy, (2) can give valuable feedback in testing, (3) all have their own creative projects and skills for mutual support and (4) are patient with less-than-finished websites :D\n\nHere's what our first public release will have on offer: exchange of tasks and products using the network barter algorithm, and a buy-now feature.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Tasks</strong> allow to outsource something like \"subtitle this video into English\". Multiple Edgeryders would apply to do a task, and the user for which the network barter algorithm can find a fitting network barter exchange would get to do the task.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Products</strong> allow to barter physical or digital items in exchange for receiveing other tasks and products at the same time. This can include pre-packaged services like \"I would translate up to 500 words from English to Italian for 7 EUR\". In contrast to tasks, where you have to wait for others to apply, there will be a buy-now feature for products.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Buy-now</strong> are similar to the regular network barter deals, but selected by a user who wants a certain product to be included in the deal, right now. To make this possible, the user has to \"catalyzing\" a network barter deal with a bit of money (say, paying in 5 EUR in money and 45 EUR in barter for getting 50 EUR worth of things). This is needed to fill potential \"gaps\" in the network barter deal which prevent it from happening on its own.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThe software will be a separate platform, but all its tasks and products can be linked to for integration with another site like Edgeryders. Note that all value will be measured in EUR, but means barter value: no cash money changes hands. Economy App will try to become self-sustainable by charging a commission fee for deals it finds: but like everything else on the platform (except the buy-now feature), this is charged in barter value, so should not hurt. Its core algorithm will be released as open source software, but not (yet) the user interface, since it relies on a SaaS business model.\n\nDoes that sound interesting, Edgeryders?

Then decided to create a poultry farm with a capital of EGP 2000, and this was the beginning of the transformation. While writing the company's contract they decided to allocate 10% of the profit to be spent in the \u201cfaces of his goodness\u201d and called it the \"share the greatest partner,\" and when they found the profit was higher than they expected, the increased the percentage to 20% of the profit, until it reached 100% of the profits of ten farms (a sort of endowment). Over the years, beside the farms, number of factories were set \u2013 up to feed the cattle. They traded in agricultural products and exported citrus fruits, potatoes and onions to several countries outside Egypt. They established a bigger farm outside the village in a Tal El Kebeer, and the size of investments has reached 35 millions pounds, and three companies. </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>An \u201cIslamic Center\u201d was founded to implement the charity \u201cZakat\u201d projects agreed upon through several committees: Committee for Education; Committee for agriculture; Committee for Youth; Committee for Health; Committee for the reconciliations and the Commission for Zakat. </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>In few years, there has been four Azhar colleges: Sharia, education for boys, trade, and human studies for girls, students dorms, a nursery that accepts 350 children, a central hospital, a railway station and Central Communications, and Islamic complex services. The residents have established these projects by their own efforts, and without depending on the Government, in the framework of a series of annual projects that did not stop, but tended to increase after that they decided to engage in two major projects each year. They were able to eradicate poverty and extended their work in neighboring villages. </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>The students are given free subscriptions to the railway, a free uniform, and two days before Ramadan flour and margarine containers are distributed for free on each of the village's houses, around 1000 houses including the mayors house.</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><b>Strategy for poverty eradication </b></span>\n\n<span>Zakat Committee began to collect Zakat of the population according to their activity farmer gives of his crop, a trader gives goods, doctors in the village agreed to treat and follow \u2013 up specific cases of patients for free. They committee found that the poor tend to spend the money where given to them.m consequently and after sometimes this did not solve the problem of extreme poverty. They then decided to distribute 40 ewe on widows. The following year 20 buffalo calf for poor men. They let them men cultivate food for the calves, giving each men the right to use six carats of a land they had bought for the construction of educational facilities. They provided the unemployed youth with machines (carpentry, mechanics or blacksmith), and to older people kiosks or vehicles to sell home made food, they also helped with the health certificate (micro \u2013 loans). Girls who have not completed their education where trained on sewing beside managing the house and preparing sweets, and literacy classes. They then got a sewing machine, four cloths, four reels thread for free to begin work. As uniforms were distributed for free, girls could work from home to produce three thousands uniforms for the children of the village and the neighboring village. </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><b>Commission civil dispute resolution:</b> </span>\n\n<span>No issue of the village goes to the police, all is solved by the reconciliation committee. s established </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><b>Commission of Health:</b></span>\n\n<span>They established a central hospital and in the process of establishing a health insurance hospital to serve people from surrounding villages as well. </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><i>All the projects are based on the collective action of </i><i>the various professions in the village. </i><i>They build the buildings themselves with their tools and manufactured their furniture themselves to reduce the cos</i>ts</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><b>Boom extends to the neighboring villages: </b></span>\n\n<span>Many homes has established an additional floor to rent chambers to expatriate students, which range of an average of 100 per room per month, the number of shops has also increased as a result of the movement of transport vehicles dealing with the factories, as well as the presence of student.

Per questo, quando si \u00e8 scelto di lanciare il primo prototipo a Matera, ho pensato che fosse una buona notizia: lo sguardo esterno \u00e8 utile perch\u00e9 ci permette di vedere cose che noi non vediamo pi\u00f9, o che vediamo con occhi disillusi. Io credo che il valore aggiunto dell'unMonastery a Matera sia quello di incoraggiare chi opera sul territorio da tempo ad andare avanti, rafforzando cio che gi\u00e0 c'\u00e8 con ulteriori contatti, con progetti simili. Credo che alla fine, l'innovazione fatta al Sud sia molto pi\u00f9 vicina al metodo hacker di quanto non pensiamo: forse non abbiamo l'abitudine di chiamare le cose per nome, e per di pi\u00f9 con nomi che suonano strano, ma chi giorno dopo giorno lotta per realizzare il proprio progetto sa che l'innovazione e la creativit\u00e0 non sono cose che si imparano: \u00e8 un approccio alla vita, \u00e8 una forma mentis.\u00a0\n\np.s.

The idea is that, in humans, culture and biology intertwine dynamically: evolutionary pressure makes us evolve mixed packages of genes and culture that make us fitter for survival. These packages repurpose and harness pre-existent packages. If you want to know more, <a href=\"http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10543.html\">this book</a> is a fantastic introduction.\u00a0\n\nResearchers in this area have figured out why humans have evolved rites of passage, which can be very costly (in some tribes, young men especially have to go through gruesome trials to become full members of the tribe). So where's the benefit? The benefit is that these rituals cement the tribe's cohesion, making it more fit to withstand intergroup competition, a major driver of human evolution (and suspected to have been a driver of non-human primates before we came around). How can rituals cement cohesion across participants? They harness certain biases in human cognition. For example, it has been found that doing things in sync enhances the propensity to cooperate. Consider the following\u00a0experiment.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Participants are randomly\u00a0divided in two groups. People in group A are asked to perform a simple physical act in sync with each other, like clapping hands. People in group B are asked to per form the same act, but not in sync.</li>\n\n<li>All participants are asked to play a simple\u00a0game where they need to choose between a \"cooperate\" and a \"defect\" strategy, like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma\">Prisoner's dilemma</a>.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Members of group A have a measurably higher probability to cooperate.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nSo, to make strangers connect, a sensible strategy seems to be to \"think like a hacker\" and\u00a0exploit the biases in human cognition, such as the tendency to cooperate more with people you have done something in sync with. A major bias is that we seem\u00a0to be hardwired for forming groups. It is very, very easy to make humans behave like a group \u2013 check out <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilfred_Bion\">Wilfred Bion</a>'s work for that.\u00a0\n\nObviously, this same kind of hacking is successfully used every day by racist groups, who succeed in making people hate and despise other people just like them, who have never hurt the haters and whom said haters do not even know anyway. Like the Force in Star Wars, human cognition has a dark side... but you guys, I',m sure, will stay away from it.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-07-09 19:16:45", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:51.050680", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 492, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1646, "user_id": 1057, "topic_id": 1613, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"imagecache-Featured\" src=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/sites/edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/files/imagecache/Featured/depassement2.jpg\" title=\"\">\n\n<strong>Framing of problem</strong> \u00a0So far, the decisions makers have been taking the decisions. They have thought about what policies and projects should be created and have implemented them. The citizens did not really have the opportunity to collaborate (except perhaps for voting for the policy makers). Do these ideas and directions correspond to people's deep aspirations and vision of the future of society?\n\nIn \"<a href=\"http://www.deloitte.com/assets/Dcom-Canada/Local%20Assets/Documents/Public%20Sector/ca_en_ps_unlocking_gov_fullreport_032310.pdf\">Unlocking government: How data transforms democracy</a>\", Deloitte predicted that governments will need to approach data analytics as a new core competency. \"<em>Organizational competencies, cultural norms and management processes all need to be rethought if the power of the analytics is to be exploited</em>.\"\n\nThe experimental Edgeryders project demonstrates that it is possible to probe\u00a0into the population's mind by collaborating with a group of self-selected citizens.\n\n<strong>Value proposition / Short definition</strong>\u00a0 \u00a0The data from the Edgeryders project can be used to make further analysis, and help identify issues with missing parameters, for which further collaboration with citizens and various experts (scientists, specialists) could take place.\n\n<strong>Features </strong>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Edgeryders data continuity.

Its goal was to think hard about a very difficult problem, transitioning from youth to adulthood in a time of crisis, and producing policy recommendations. <a href=\"http://t.co/Tj0N9JVT\">And we did that</a>. But since the early days it was clear that some of the more creative members of the community \u2013 while certainly willing to discuss and advise \u2013 focus most of their passion in doing things. This became impossible to ignore in December 2012, when we discovered that Edgeryders had submitted seven projects to the <a href=\"http://www.socialinnovationcompetition.eu/\">European Social Innovation Competition</a>. This is an outstanding number: the total number of submissions, <em>for the whole of Europe,</em> was 606. Does our community really have more than 1% of a whole continent's socially innovative potential?\n\nWhatever its precise measure, we do seem to have a large potential. Many of us are good at thinking way outside the box; and the incredible diversity (of age, country, gender, net worth and walks of life) of this community is a powerful boost to such challenging, radical thinking. We find it quite natural to look for ech other's collaboration \u2013 I have seen several projects spin off involving Edgeryders from different countries, and I myself have involved @Anthony and Gaia in <a href=\"http://www.insiteproject.org/2012/10/25/proudly-presenting-masters-of-networks/\">Masters of Networks</a> and Ben and the unMonastery crowd in the <a href=\"http://www.matera-basilicata2019.it/en/news/240-unmonastery-pr-matera-2019-si-parte.html\">unMonastery prototype in Matera</a>. So here is my proposal: our projects can benefit from being somehow linked to each other. \n\n\"Linked\" does not mean \"set in a hierarchy\". You have your project, you are the only one that has any hope of seeing it through. I am not thinking of an army, rather of a weather front: no cloud formation is subordinated to any other. There are no vetoes, not tune to march on. But there is plenty of interaction, and the result is a big storm. If you feel you are on the same front; if you, like me, can't unsee society undergoing terrible strains, and smell big (and not always pleasant) changes in the air; if you have a vision you are trying to make come true, and could use some smart, generous people as sounding board and collaborators; then you might consider adding your own projects to the about ten <a href=\"/groups\">already listed on this website</a>. \n\nHere's what's in it for you: give each other advice (according to time and competences); recruit each other (some of that going on already); use Edgeryders social media presence to promote your idea as part of a powerhouse of bottom-up socially innovative projects; link the projects side of things with the knowledge work side of things \u2013 because it seems that the distributed think tank is also here to stay, at least for a while, and @nadia has already secured a first project <a href=\"/t/the-edgeryders-guide-to/327-the-baltic\">to investigate the Baltic Region</a> (some of you have already been involved).

Try to stay light and open-minded about everything.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.immaginoteca.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/tokyo.png\" style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 23px;\"><br style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 23px;\">\n\n<span>PHOTO ABOVE : Palais de Tokyo by\u00a0</span><a href=\"http://www.archdaily.com/248026/palais-de-tokyo-expansion-lacaton-vassal/\" style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 23px;\">Lacaton &amp;\u00a0Vassal</a>\n\n<h3><strong>2 - FOOD MAKE PEOPLE PARTICIPATE</strong></h3>\n\nAt the beginning, it was difficult to make people engaged about <a href=\"http://dreamhamar.org/\">dreamhamar</a>, until when\u00a0we decided to make a collaborative breakfast/lunch\u00a0(photo below)\u00a0for citizens and students, and it was great!\n\nPeople started to meet, discuss and share their ideas.

Through our experience working with community gardens, we founded Common Grounds in order to develop a forum that encourages ways of more sustainable thinking and acting. Our focus lies on identifying the potentials and needs of local, participative projects, primarily urban gardens, in order to formulate policy recommendations. Here we not only look at what these projects need while they commence, but specifically what they need to proliferate, and how these project can be incorporated within city planning and environmental strategies.\n\nBut let\u2019s start from the beginning\u2026\n\n<h2><strong>Prinzessinnengarten: Making gardens from wasteland</strong></h2>\n\nAt Moritzplatz, a busy roundabout in the center of bustling Berlin-Kreuzberg, well over a thousand supporters have helped the site to grow, turning a lot that was vacant for 60 years into a flourishing garden. Without specific expertise, with little money and motivated by the idea of a communally used garden in the center of the city, we began in summer 2009 to put down the first roots of a flourishing garden between cement and rubble. By now, a huge diversity of plants is growing here as well as a diversity of social relations. People of different origins and of different ages meet and exchange their knowledge and their experience.\n\nThe Prinzessinnengarten is a communal project; our vegetable beds are shared without anyone claiming individual ownership. Over the course of four years, supporters from the local community have dirtied their hands in order to help the idea of social and ecological urban agriculture become real. This social and ecological engagement takes place in a neighborhood that is one of the most densely developed and socially most vulnerable in the city. Here a garden evolved that can sustain itself financially and that grew into a locus of social exchange and mutual learning.\n\nUrban gardens inspire sustainable and locally grounded urban development. Prinzessinnengarten, as well as other urban gardens in Germany, have been able to develop small economies around its activities. Prinzessinnengarten has been able to support 15 full-time jobs during it seasons, being financially independent through its economic activities such as horticulture, the tending of a small caf\u00e9, selling its products, as well as giving training in gardening, ecology or the planning of further gardens. At the same time it has been able to offer high quality, healthy and ecological food at affordable prices.\u00a0\n\nIn cooperation with local institutions, with universities and international partners, the Prinzessinnengarten became a laboratory for socially and ecologically resilient forms of urban development. In a pragmatic manner we ask questions on how to deal with urgent issues such as climate change, dwindling resources, food sovereignty and the loss of biodiversity. The answers being experienced and experimented on all strive toward the creation of a resilient city, not only taking global challenges such as climate change into consideration, but also incorporating local actors in the building of practical and local solutions.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThe success of the garden has been vividly mirrored in vast press coverage: Since 2009, well over a thousand supporters have helped the site to grow \u201efrom an ugly vacant lot to a paradise\u201c (Die Zeit). 50,000 visitors come to Moritzplatz each year to see this \u201ebiotope and sociotope with a model character\u201c (Tagesspiegel), this \u201eutopia in miniature\u201c (Berliner Zeitung), this \u201elaboratory for the sustainable city of the future\u201c (Wirtschaftswoche). The value for the city of Berlin that comes from the Prinzessinnengarten and similar projects is undisputed, even by official sources. Experts see it as a laboratory for socially and ecologically sustainable forms of urban development. Internationally, whether at the EXPO in Shanghai or in the New York Times, the Prinzessinnengarten exemplifies a Berlin of open spaces for social and cultural engagement. The Berlin Senate has now announced the promotion of urban gardening as part of a sustainable urban policy.\n\n<h2><strong>Making urban gardens more than just an \u201cexceptions to the rule\u201d</strong></h2>\n\nDespite the garden being a celebrated pioneer project, last year the Berlin Property Fund was commissioned to sell the plot of land on which the garden stands. \u00a0We only had an annually renewable lease, leaving no prospects for long-term planning. Through the immense support of our public and an increasingly motivated government, the Berlin government decided to return the property the Borough of Kreuzberg-Friedrichshain. The Prinzessinnengarten has been able to establish its model character as locus of social, ecological and urban change.\n\n<h2><strong>Urban gardens \u2013 here to stay!(?)</strong></h2>\n\nIt is within this context that Common Grounds e.V. has emerged. Together with Prinzessinnengarten and the foundation anstiftung &amp; ertomis \u2013 a foundation working nationwide on researching and supporting new practices for sustainable lifestyles, like <a href=\"http://www.null-euro-urbanismus.de/?p=804\">DIY-cultures</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_commons\">commons</a> and urban agriculture \u2013 Common Grounds e.V. is building a platform for technical and political assistance to new garden initiatives. The idea of the Prinzessinnengarten is cross-fertilizing: in many other places in Berlin (with the building of school gardens, or gardens in universities or other institutions), as well as in cities like <a href=\"http://www.gartendeck.de/\">Hamburg</a>, <a href=\"http://www.garten-leipzig.net/stiftung/2012_Annalinde.asp\">Leipzig</a> or <a href=\"http://www.neuland-koeln.de/\">Cologne</a> and also <a href=\"http://matparken.se/\">internationally</a>, people have started to build urban gardens in their neighborhood, inspired by the Prinzessinnengarten. Often, however, their work has been put under strain due to conflicting interest between investors, housing and privatization goals of its own local governments. Taking the recent challenges facing Prinzessinnengarten into account, we see that the needs of garden initiatives surpass merely assisting them during their start-up phase. \u00a0We also have to find policy solutions for the proliferation of urban gardens.\u00a0 This platform will, together with other gardens, take the first steps toward a nationwide network supporting urban gardens and their existence in our cities. This will not only have a local impact on our neighborhoods, but can also be an important instrument in the creation of resilience in our cities, both environmentally and economically.\n\n<em>Elizabeth Calder\u00f3n L\u00fcning, Caroline Paulick-Thiel &amp; Marco Clausen, February 2013, Berlin</em>\n\n", "created_at": "2013-02-18 16:08:02", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:33.982125", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1123, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8048, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1944, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>So, you'd need... </b>\n\n...classrooms!

The <a href=\"http://unmonastery.org/\">unMonastery</a>, born out of <a href=\"https://edgeryders.eu\">Edgeryders</a> and prototyped in Matera, Italy, as part of its winning bid for European capital of culture 2019, prompted me to think some long, deep thoughts on the monastic movement as it emerged in Western Europe starting in the early 7th century. My provisional conclusion is that <strong>the dizzying scale, scope and impact of the monastic movement owes much to St. Benedict's Rule, which I interpret as an open source protocol for human-to-human interaction</strong>. I have developed these reflections <a href=\"/t/unhagiography-what-modern-day-social-innovators-can-learn-from-the-life-and-times-of-st-benedict/1882\">here</a> and <a href=\"/t/monastery-vs-unmonastery-reflecting-on-a-deep-conversation-with-father-cassian-folsom/3610\">here</a>.\n\nEver since we started researching the Rule, <strong>the question always has been: can we do better?</strong> Can we apply what we know now about complex systems to write a version of the Rule that would nudge <em>open</em> <em>networks</em> of people, rather than cloistered communities, towards producing the common good (whatever that is), while respecting the freedom of individuals? And can we do that without a transcendent God underwriting the whole effort, endlessly regenerating our motivation? For over one year now people have been speaking of writing a document called <em>Protocol</em>, by analogy with St. Benedict's Rule and Neal Stephenson's (fictional) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anathem#The_.22Discipline.22\">Discipline</a>. But so far, nobody has done it: even a sandboxed sketch <a href=\"/t/process-map-2-generating-protocol/4266\">has proven unexpectedly hard to do</a>.\n\nIn this post, I have a first go at Protocol. It's nothing more than a sketch, very likely unworkable. But I had fun thinking about it, and I believe I have captured a sense for what the architecture of a fully developed Protocol should look like. I already live according to it, so I know it is sustainable even when no one else adopts it \u2013 a necessary requisite of Protocol, whose early followers are doomed to live in a world that does not itself follow Protocol.\n\nA word of warning. Protocol is obviously not enough to make a successful community, just as the Rule is not enough to make a peaceful, thriving Benedictine abbey. Communities need many other things including physical and virtual spaces, databases, economic models, nice people who can tell a good joke, and, most important, shared values to preserve their cohesiveness along the journey. I focus on Protocol here because I am trying to design a setting with the absolute minimum of cohercion. In communities, it is probably inevitable that people must be able to \"throw the Book\" at each other if something goes wrong; but then, the Book should be minimal and focus on enabling rather than forbidding. Protocol focuses on <em>interaction,</em> and in so doing takes away the incentive to question each other's motivations; orthodoxy (\"the why\") does not matter, all that matters is how we interact. \n\nI proceed as follows. First, I state the fundamental units of Protocol, which I will call <em>algorithms</em> (the Rule is divided into chapters; Protocol is divided into algorithms, to follow our computer science analogy). Next, I look at it from an architectural point of view, providing an explanation for its structure. Finally, I discuss each individual algorithm.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Protocol 0.1 as a whole</h3>\n\n00. Who does the work calls the shots.\n\n01. Be open, also in the way you think of \"open\".\n\n02. Never use rhetoric on your brethren.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Architecture</h3>\n\nMy inspiration for the architecture of Protocol is complex adaptive system dynamics. Complex systems are interesting because they change, yielding perpetual novelty; but their changing is somehow constrained. They don't fizzle out nor explode, but hover, as per Doyne Farmer's beautiful expression, at the edge of chaos. For this to happen, <strong>complex adaptive systems must be subject to two opposite forces; one that produces variation, and another that reduces it.</strong> Too much variation, and the system \"explodes\" and becomes chaotic; too much variation reduction, and it becomes static. The most familiar example of such forces at work is, to many of us, Darwin's theory of evolution: mutation and sex are engines of variability. Natural selection is an engine of variability reduction. The first engine produces novelty (innovation); the second engine gets rid of anything that is not advantageous. Taken together, these two independent forces make species fitter and better adapted to their environment over time.\n\nIn Protocol, algorithm 01 is the selection engine; algorithm 00 is the variability engine. Algorithm 02 is there to make sure that algorithms 00 and 01 can function properly, and are not hacked into impotence by gifted rhetors. It is necessary because Protocol applies to the social world, and we social agents behave strategically and are prone to bias \u2013 in other words, we lie, often to ourselves, and we come with nasty cognitive biases that make us easy to deceive (vanity, for example). Benedict must have been keenly aware of this issue (Catholicism was never too starry-eyed about human nature) so the Rule contains provisions that essentially forbid any monastic politicking, by placing conflict resolution firmly in the hands of the Abbott (himself subject to the Rule).\n\nI have deliberately tried to keep Protocol minimal to avoid feature creep.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">0. Who does the work calls the shots.</h3>\n\nAn Edgeryders classic, algorithm 0 was dreamed up several years ago as a talisman to ward off whining, complaining and sentences that begin with \"We should...\" or \"We must..\". What it means to say is that there is no entity called \"We\" listening to us. <strong>If you want something to happen, you have to make it happen yourself</strong>. Only then you will have earned the right to demand that others follow your lead and help you. In my experience, most people who say \"we should do X\" mean that <em>you</em> should do X, and their contribution is in telling you what to do. Such behaviour is clearly undesirable in an unMonastery, or any environment attempting to get things done.\n\nAlgorithm 0 is an engine of selection. It is intended as a way to choose, among many possible courses of actions, those that are followed and those that are not. This does not happen by voting, because voting generates losers (this point is argued brilliantly in Rick Falkvinge's <a href=\"http://falkvinge.net/2013/02/14/swarmwise-the-tactical-manual-to-changing-the-world-chapter-one/\">Swarmwise</a>). It does not happen by consensus, because consensus wastes inordinate amounts of everybody's time and gives the complainers the power to veto the doers.<strong> It happens by action: if at least one person believes something is important enough to warrant her work, that thing gets done</strong>. If not, it does not. This makes a community of followers of Protocol a firm do-ocracy.\n\nIf two unBrethren want to follow opposite courses of action, and they are both prepared to put in the work, both are free to do so. It's not inconsistency, it's prototyping, or hedging your bets. If both solutions are successful, they will co-exist. If they are successful and incompatible, the community forks. This is not disaster, but a success: it happened innumerable times in the history of the monastic movement (as well as open source software). Several long-term successful orders, like the Camaldolese or the Cistercians, derive their names not from a founder like Benedict, but from a monastery: the order crystallised around a successful variant of the Rule adopted in that specific abbey, and spread out from there as a fork of the Benedictines.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">1. Be open, also in the way you think of \"open\".</h3>\n\nDo-ocracies are a good thing, but they risk a sort of lock-in phenomenon known as \"dictatorship of the active\". People who get an early breakthrough at doing things acquire valuable experience, that makes them better at doing more things in the future. In small communities (unMonasteries will be small for the foreseeable future), this might lead to insufficient diversity: a small number of capable people do most of the work, so they call most of the shots. Over time, the community becomes narrow-minded and fixated, a mere extension of the few active people; with not enough thinking minds, it cannot really draw on collective intelligence; it becomes a simple system, not a complex one. \n\nAlgorithm 1 is intended as a way to bring in novelty in any network or community that runs on Protocol. It does not<em>, </em>per se, <em>generate </em>novelty the same way that mutation does in evolution theory; what it does is explicitly allow <em>people</em> to bring in novelty. It does so by giving everyone permission to reuse, remix and repurpose everyone else's ideas or content. <strong>It implies that knowledge in an unMonastery should always be open, in the strict sense of the <a href=\"http://opendefinition.org/\">Open Definition</a>.</strong>\n\nAlgorithm 1 is recursive: you should be open about what \"being open\" means. I put the recursion in because I mistrust human nature's tendency to entrench and exclude (or, if you prefer, the fact that <a href=\"http://people.hss.caltech.edu/~mshum/ec105/matt5.pdf\">cartels are Nash equilibria</a>). To counteract it, the recursion in algorithm 01 recommends questioning the nature of openness, always pushing it in the direction of more of it. Being open about being open, I find, makes me think of non-strict, but fruitful ways to think about openness: for example, it tells me that diversity is inherently positive. Communities who live according to Protocol will actively seek out people who are different, because in an open world difference fuels recombination. The more diversity you have access to, the more free you are.\n\nIf an unMonastic community gets stuck in a low-diversity \"dictatorship of the active\" situation, algorithm 1 does <em>not </em> place the responsibility of getting it unstuck on the people who are currently active. Those people do what they do, and who does the work calls the shots. Another way to look at it is that the community's function is not to restrict, but to enable, and active people are <em>already</em> enabled! Instead, algorithm 1 points to the freedom that <em>everyone</em> in the community or network enjoys, and insists that we all have more space for action than we think we have. It is our common responsibility to use that space to get unstuck.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">2. Never use rhetoric on your brethren</h3>\n\nOne of the less pleasant experiences of these two years of unMonastery has been the all too human bickering and politicking. Like most people, I got my share of bruises, but try not to take it personally: like everyone else, unMonasterians are people, with all their human fallibility, and we have no Benedict's Rule to guide our steps, no superior to bring us in line. Some of the discussions got quite ugly and insincere, and that really brought home how it is impossible to make any progress without a commitment to seeking the truth, <em>especially</em> when it is uncomfortable.\n\n<strong>There are two ways to think about debate: as a common search for the truth and as combat.</strong> The conventions underpinning the scientific community, for all their faults, attempt to make debate into a search tool:  peer-review, bibliometrics, high tolerance for strong and explicit disagreement, zero-tolerance for unsubstantiated claims. On the opposite side of the fence, politics has often wielded debate as a tool for aggression. Rhetoric emerged as a technique to argue and persuade. White hat rhetors use it to make their argument clearer and more transparent; black hat rhetors use it to confuse, hurt, undermine and prevail. \"Never mind the truth \u2013 pursue probability through thick and thin in every kind of speech; the whole secret of the art of speaking lies in consistent adherence to this principle.\" <a href=\"https://mcl.as.uky.edu/glossary-rhetorical-terms\">writes Plato</a>, with obvious contempt, in <em>Phaedrus</em>.\n\nIt is unlikely that rhetoric can (or, indeed, should) really be expunged from speech; this point was made forcefully already by classical authors, from Aristotle to Cicero. Algorithm 2 is therefore not an unrealistic ban; what it does is <strong>give brethren who take part in a discussion the right (and indeed the duty) to protest if they think rhetorical techniques are being used to defeat someone, rather than to seek the truth with them</strong>. Someone will shout \"Rhetorical question!\" or \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slippery_slope\">Slippery slope fallacy</a>!\"; the person guilty of using rhetoric on her brethren will then need to apologise, and probably do the dishes that night. For this to happen, it is advisable that all unMonasterians study the art of rhetoric, with the same attitude that monks and priests employ towards sin.\n\nThat's as far as I got. It's rough and minimal, but I cannot think of any compelling argument for Protocol 0.1 to be fundamentally flawed. Can you? I will be grateful for any feedback.\n\n<em>Photo credit: alex_inside on flickr.com.

The aim of the project is to reconnect the two by promoting dis-intermediated interaction and building of shared approaches to youth policy.\n\nThe Policy Hero Challenge starts as a facilitated online conversation on the Edgeryders interactive platform, casting young people as citizen experts on youth policy. They will be invited to spot key education, work and social inclusion challenges and the solutions experienced first hand. During two 4 day physical events in [City 1] and [City 2], 30 citizen experts from across Europe will meet and engage in a direct, honest, solution-centred conversation with policy experts from various decision-making levels. The goal will be to harness participants' individual stories into realistic policy proposals enabling European youth to live more fulfilling lives. Throughout the project, young participants will co-design event agendas, actively report outcomes from the sessions, therefore learning how to integrate political information and better articulate policy opinions. They become policy heroes, acknowledged and highlighted by the promoters through active community building and social engagement. The results of this exercise will be aggregated in an online Policy Hero Handbook to be distributed freely among broader communities of practice across Europe.\n\n<h3>Operational capacity</h3>\n\nEdgeryders formed in 2011 to work on a Council of Europe report of practical policy recommendations. The goal was to have young (mostly under 25) Europeans take part in a collaborative policy process, acting as advisors to policy makers. After six months, we had collected 1,700 pages of high-quality ethnographic data (500 posts and 4,500 comments by 1,200 users in more than 30 countries). We then employed young ethnographers to \u201ccode\u201d the material and run results by a panel of academics. We also wrote software to map interaction patterns in the Edgeryders platform, and ran network analysis to detect and enhance emergent social dynamics that could be relevant to the task. The project ended with the delivery of \u201cEdgeryders Guide to the Future: A handbook for policy makers and managers of policy-oriented online communities.\u201d http://www.scribd.com/doc/116463853; http://edgeryders.wikispiral.org/\n\nThe team behind Edgeryders also has a good record of designing and organising events. Our former community events, Living on the Edge, took place in 2012 in Strasbourg and in Brussels. 150 participants attended the first, and over 80 participants came from all corners of Europe and used personal finances to reach Brussels for the second. Many of them took an active role in organizing the event on a volunteer basis.\n\nFinally, the Edgeryders social enterprise is aimed at building generative relationships within the policy space. Collaborations with Swedish think tank Global Utmaning (/t/the-edgeryders-guide-to/327-the-baltic) and the United Nations Development Programme (our team was invited to hold a webinar and participate in a consultation exercise on the 2015 development agenda) are further evidence of demand for first hand knowledge that Edgeryders-like citizens have, as well as potential impact through policy consultations.\n\n<h3>Relevant fields</h3>\n\nGeneral:\n\n-youth participation\n\n-cultural diversity\n\n-inclusion\n\n-fight against poverty and marginalization\n\nSpecific:\n\n-<span>\u00a0to promote young people\u2019s active citizenship in general and their European citizenship in particular</span>\n\n<span>- to contribute to developing the quality of support systems for youth activities and the capabilities of civil society organisations in the youth field\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>-</span><span>\u00a0to promote European cooperation in the youth field</span>\n\n<div>\n\nWe think the more stakeholders are involved in policy making, the higher the chances to achieve better policies -generating better support mechanisms for youth.\n\nBy highlighting participants\u2019 views on policies as active factor in decision-making and validating this through the presence of policy makers at The Policy Hero Challenge events, we believe youth's level of knowledge and reasonable expectations regarding policies will increase and will generate longer term effects through future participation. Moreover, we are reversing the idea of citizens as passive recipients of policies and making them protagonists - policy heroes in our project, therefore strengthening their sense of citizenship and empowerment.\n\nYoung people from the Edge (referencing EdgeRyders ethos) are often those living in precarity or economic instability as they try out new, sometimes radical solutions. By bringing the Edge closer to the centre, as opposed to the society\u2019s tendency to marginalise its most radical members, we make a contribution towards increased social cohesion.\n\nThe Policy Hero Challenge happens in international contexts fostering dialogue and cooperation among people coming from diverse backgrounds and experiences, and a variety of European countries; especially its informal workshops are fostering mechanisms of peer to peer support, by encouraging young people to get inspired and learn from one another, as well as develop collaborations outside the project framework.</div>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<h3>Thematic concept</h3>\n\nThe Policy Hero Challenge:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\tInvolves citizens in participatory exercises to design realistic, ready-to-roll policy measures, to debug Europe's next generation of policies around education, labour and employment, social cohesion.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tAllows participants to engage with their representatives in a respectful, non-mediated context.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tPromotes mutual understanding of challenges faced by policymakers as well as young people, not only one way.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tMobilizes the creativity of citizens to route around roadblocks currently preventing public policies to be the tool for collective changemaking Europe wants \u2013 and deserves.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tTackles the complexities of policy making full-on: vested interests, inertia, leads and lags in political processes all need to be taken on board and hacked in search of solutions.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tPromotes a narrative of result-oriented collaboration between citizens and institutions, where the former are not merely \u201clistened to\u201d but are enlisted as active collaborators \u2013 and the latter are acknowledged as powerful tools for collective action and not dismissed as irrelevant or worse.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Partnerships and Activities/ Project design</h3>\n\nEdgeryders have collaborated previously with founders or members of other partner organisations as they joined conversations on our online platform. Together, the promoters in this project have access to a wide human resource and potential participants in The Policy Hero Challenge (TPHC), distributed across most European countries.\n\n<strong>Preparation:</strong>\u00a0<span>The Edgeryders team will be in charge with launching communications, internal coordination and organizing online planning meetings. All promoters commit to launching and translating TPHC call to their networks to ensure participation of youth from diverse social and cultural backgrounds - most of them can recruit 2 to 5 participants. Following its previous experience, the Edgeryders team will actively involve both citizen experts and policy makers early on, to codesign the content of the sessions and workshops, using the online platform to host the conversation and generate input on youth policy ahead of the events, therefore raising visibility of the project. Edgeryders will recruit a community manager and two engagement managers charged with facilitating the online conversation and outreach and (media) partnership building, respectively. The technical director will create a dedicated web space on </span><a href=\"https://edgeryders.eu\" style=\"line-height: 1.7;\">https://edgeryders.eu</a><span> where young participants can share their contributions.</span>\n\n<strong>Activity:\u00a0</strong><span>The promoters agree to recruit key young contributors to seed the discussions in the initial phase. Later on young expert leaders will prepare each challenge at the event and coordinate the work of transforming it into concrete steps for policy action. This is part of actively engaging young beneficiaries not just as recipients of travel grants, but also as builders of the events. [Partner in City 1] and [Parner in City\u00a02]</span><span>\u00a0will be creating small location teams tasked with technical and logistic support, as well as welcoming participants and assisting them to the venues and accommodation locations.</span>\n\n<strong>Evaluation</strong>:\u00a0<span>The major output of the project is the collaboratively build Policy Hero Handbook containing all policy proposals and a curated summary of the overall online and offline conversation from both events. This will also be an indicator of the vast number of people we reach through the project, plus it is a gift to them as protagonists of the project, rather than remaining traditional beneficiaries.\u00a0</span><span>During the pre-event two months long conversation on the proposals and one month follow up, online traction - event page and Edgeryders website visitors, number of posts and comments - will be used as indicator of the project\u2019s success.</span>\n\n<h3><span>Project content and methodology</span></h3>\n\nYoung people are expected to become educated, make a living and turn into active citizens against a backdrop of rising unemployment, high costs of housing or increasing ranks of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/newsnight/paulmason/2011/02/twenty_reasons_why_its_kicking.html\">graduates with no future</a>. Tentative policy topics to be explored are: having a job versus making a living, the social cost of being an entrepreneur, online courses as vehicles for cheaper education, recognition of informally acquired skills, reducing unpaid internships, and building personal and community resilience. All these are examples of how the real individual trajectories can be better supported through adequate policy, rather than being unable to fit existing institutional frameworks.\n\n<em>- the working methods</em>\n\n<strong>Integrated research:</strong> The Preparation phase will include integrating information from existing surveys, collecting information from the grassroots organisations and young people themselves, analysis of youth media, and direct input from the promoters\u2019 communities.\n\n<strong>Open design process: </strong>The event agenda is built in a highly participatory way, where anybody wishing to contribute with input can do so. Depending on what participants deem as most pressing policy issues, the project organisers will incorporate that into the final agenda.\n\n<strong>Narrative weaving</strong>: The citizen expert narrative emphasizes how, unlike traditional experts, \u201cyou do not have to have a PhD in the humanities or science to be able to participate meaningfully: your experience in a specific area qualifies you as a citizen expert\u201d.\n\n<strong>Engagement strategy:</strong> This refers to community management and efforts to generate excitement, such as assemble a social media team, set up weekly online calls with participants, create a collaborative workspace, give proper recognition to all volunteering efforts.\n\n<strong>Collaborative writing:</strong> The Handbook resulting from the project is a product generated by many people and brings together a richness of expertise, a variety of experiences, yet shared worldviews.\n\n<strong>Euro-English:</strong> We will prepare communication prior to the event in English and translate it into different languages for outreach. Onsite the language will be Euro-English, the lingua franca a lot of young Europeans use when they move about; it is an inclusive, connecting language that most youth speak enough to communicate. We will publish guidelines in advance, making it clear that participants agree to be tolerant of each other's mistakes.\n\n<em>- how the planned activities and working methods will contribute to the process of non-formal learning and to the promotion of social and personal development of young people involved in the project.</em>\n\nMeeting policymakers face to face and engage in the discussion of pressing issues will enable better understanding of policy making processes; moreover, youth will learn to represent themselves and express their ideas convincingly as active citizens who don\u2019t experience challenges in isolation, but see the more complex picture.\n\nWe are taking responsibility to not alienate those wary of the shouting match of mainstream politics and bridge the expertise that is often discarded with the institutional feedback drops. If lack of clarity arises related to specific terminology or processes of policy making, those with a background in law or social science will facilitate understanding between policymakers and young people.\n\nThe building of social capital is pursued at all stages of the event, by creating an interactive, open dialogue space both online and offline. The two days of unconference will create a context for peer to peer learning.\n\n<em>- how the young people will be actively involved in each stage of the project.</em>\n\nThe Policy Hero Challenge is designed in a participatory way, assuring that the participants put their effort in preparation of the topic they the most interested in. They will also be invited to help organise the project events which we will frame as \u201ctheir own\u201d, developing skills for: blogging, photography, video, sound, graphic design, surveys, sharing information and tips on logistical organisation.\n\n<h3>Impact, Multiplier and Follow-up</h3>\n\n<div><span>Participants are those young people critical of the current state of affairs and are at risk of turning their back on mainstream society. Considering their recurrent depictions in the mass media as \u201cradicals\u201d or violence-prone, this is worrying for both governments and the society at large. By playing an active rather than reactive role, they raise their stakes in it instead and are part of the solution.</span></div>\n\n<div>\n\n<span>The skills and capacities of people lacking a by-the-book professional status - for example, the incomplete formal education or being on unemployed benefits - often go unnoticed and not fully applied. Linking young people with fewer opportunities together in multidisciplinary teams supports the accumulation of social capital and increases their opportunities, both personal and professional.</span>\n\n\u00a0</div>\n\nAs mentioned above, participants from different countries will be able to stay in contact through social networks, and will be able to exchange knowledge and ideas about the possible usage of their skills, and possibly create projects which can be run online, such as ones related to blogging. On top of that a pan European social capital is an asset, especially if one considers the currently increasing mobility.\n\nLastly, the participatory nature of the preparation stage of the Policy Hero Challenge also opens up a possibility to improve organisational skills through volunteering of participants.\n\nThe Policy Hero Challenge does not end with the events. With the help of partner institutions and youth communities, we will engage more people in fleshing out the measures that come out of the project. This is part of a wider attempt of our organisations to build networks of institutional actors who are willing to come closer to the lived impact of their policies and adopt better ones.\n\nIn terms of impacting local communities, local policy discussed during the events can further be developed into prototypes and projects, with only local organisations, authorities and youngsters involved, without direct participation of promoters and organisers. They can however make themselves available for free consulting. The Policy Hero Challenge can be also replicated easily after the event has been prototyped, engaging more young people and local facilitators (for example students with political science background). Organisation process, including logistics and actual sessions will be documented, therefore facilitating event replicas or even scaling the current format.\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>", "created_at": "2014-01-14 11:22:31", "updated_at": "2017-10-02 15:11:34.728534", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2815, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 25.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23230, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5596, "post_number": 10, "raw": "<b>Not from friends...</b>\n\nNo, we cannot find friends to do this.

Impressed by the number of warm replies and offers from Materani!\u00a0If you could create an account on that website too and say hi, or even simply retweet it/reshare it, that would be hugely appreciated.\n\nEnglish version:\u00a0</em><a href=\"http://goo.gl/h6fGtS\">http://goo.gl/h6fGtS</a>\u00a0\u00a0\n\n<em>Italian version:\u00a0</em><a href=\"http://goo.gl/W9xQqB\">http://goo.gl/W9xQqB</a>\u00a0\n\n<strong>An Invitation to Live on the Edge [LOTE]</strong>\n\nDear citizens of Matera,\n\nWe are Edgeryders, an informal group of hundreds of people coming from all over Europe. We have in common the idea that we can contribute to resolving big problems (like global warming or the increasing precariousness) even if we aren\u2019t political leaders, industry heads or famous academia people, but simple citizens like you. It is very ambitious, but we work hard and have willingness to learn.\n\nFrom 29th of October to 3rd of November we will be your guests. Our common work happens almost always on the Internet, but a couple of times a year we meet physically at events that we call Living On The Edge (part conference, part party, part practical work). After Strasbourg and Brussels in 2012, the third Living On The Edge will take place in your city.\n\nArriving to Matera from places like Bergen, Lisbon or Cluj-Napoca is neither simple, nor cheap \u00a0(we don\u2019t have big sponsors, and the majority of us aren\u2019t wealthy). But we come willingly, because a project born out of Edgeryders, the unMonastery, is taking root in Matera. During these latest months some of us have had the chance to come to your city because of this project, and everyone has become enthusiastic about the beauty of the place and your hospitality and kindness. We have decided a trip is worth the effort, and besides, this way everyone gets to see the unMonastery!\n\nThe most important lesson we are learning from the unMonastery group \u2013 who are learning it from you \u2013 is how important a cohesive local community is for the success of a project. In Strasbourg and Brussels we didn\u2019t have a real connection to the people living there: in Matera, on the other hand, we would like to invite you to share with us Living On The Edge. We are certain that we can learn a lot together, from one another, and \u00a0maybe even collaborate in the future. There will be language barriers, cultural barriers and other barriers of all kinds, but don't worry: we are used to those, as we ourselves are nothing if not a diverse group (we come from 30 different countries!). We are sure we\u2019ll understand each other.\n\nThere are a lot of things we could do together. For example, you could collaborate with us to build Living On The Edge; there are a lot of activities where you could help make the event nicer. You can put yourselves forward as speakers, to talk about something close to your heart, or take pictures to help document the event, or do some translation so that no one has to feel excluded. If you have a little extra space, you can accommodate one of us for the duration of the conference \u2013 for some Edgeryders a place to stay can make the difference between being able to coming to the conference or not. Or you can simply join us at Palazzo del Casale, in the heart of Sasso Barisano, to meet up and spend some time together. We are also considering organizing a Halloween party, and of course you are invited!\n\nIf you are interested in any of these things, or just want to learn more, write to\u00a0Ilaria\u00a0or Noemi, in Italian or English, as you prefer. We would be thrilled to meet you! Thank you again for the opportunity that we have to visit your city.\n\nAndrea, Andrei, Alberto, Auli, Bembo, Ben, Bridget, Dorotea, Noemi, Nadia and many others\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-08-02 10:24:20", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:09.423151", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 751, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2037, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 2004, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Yesterday evening we held the first Edgeryders workshop in South Africa, held at Jozihub with the kind support of the Swedish Embassy in Pretoria.

I think three things are crucial to this taking off in SA:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><span>Place-makeing: creating context for engagement, asking questions and exploring themes that matter to many people in a deep way</span></li>\n\n<li><span>Town(ship) calling: Bridging online &amp; offline interaction.

Here someone raised the point that part of what makes Edgeryders work is that we have developed a writing culture and that getting ourselves and others to develop writing and documentation skills is crucial. As I walked past one of the groups I overhead a discussion around education, skill development and use of skills. There were a number of examples of pedagogics and effective learning methodologies e.g. hole in the wall, the Equal Education Project, etc.</span>\n\n<span>What\u2019s an effective pedagogical method for improving reading, comperehension and writing in a relatively quick time frame?

Most people find their way to the right places in through links via social media. So\u00a0<strong>when we do outreach campaigns we build minisites to aggregate links to where the relevant discussions, collaborations and events are happening.</strong>\u00a0There are three options for getting this done. In all three cases I suggest having a look at <a href=\"/t/spot-the-future-is-designed-for-emergence-any-thoughts/2506\">how we are building the project as a whole</a>, and how we are setting up\u00a0<a href=\"/t/spot-the-future-tour-info-pack/2524\">the tour</a>\u00a0and the l<a href=\"/t/working-out-loud-on-spot-the-future-what-we-are-doing-this-week/2496\">ast week's Working Out Loud post</a>.\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Option \\#1: In the past we built\u00a0<a href=\"/t/lote3/312\">minisites within the site like for LOTE3</a>. As you see the output is more functional than glossy.\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Advantage: you learn to shape your working environment and take control over the tools we use by\u00a0<a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/build-your-own-home-why-the-user-experience-on-the-edgeryders-website-is-worse-than-on\">building your own home</a>.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Disadvantage: you operate within the constraints of drupal and have to take responsibility for ensuring it all comes together. \u00a0Also [Matthias], Edgeryders Tech lead doesn't like this option. \u00a0I would not go for this option to be honest.</li>\n\n</ul></li>\n\n<li>Option \\#2: I've tested\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.squarespace.com/\">squarespace</a>\u00a0to produce the\u00a0<a href=\"http://company.edgeryders.eu/\">Edgeryders Company site</a>\u00a0and the experience was very smooth. \u00a0I would go for this version and <a href=\"/t/spot-the-future-team/357/spot-the-future-funnel-website-started\">Matthias has already set it up</a> so we are ready to just enter content.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Advantage: very quick and nice finish.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Disadvantage: it's a commercial service but since we are running on a tight deadline for the delivery I think this is less of a concern. Also, you can export all the contents into a wordpress site so we needen't be dependent on them for long.</li>\n\n</ul></li>\n\n<li><strong>A third option which is halfway between but which I like the best is</strong>\u00a0<a href=\"http://unmonastery.net\">unMonastery.net</a>\u00a0that [Ben] and [elf Pavlik] have set up. The main issue is that it is not fully integrated with the Edgeryders.eu backend which leads to fragmentation of the community and conversations and makes it hardfer for us to build more community-powered initiatives like the unMonastery. It's fully decentralised and people have to learn the markup language to be able to edit its contents. Also Elf put in a nice little feature he can tell you about in person :)\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Advantage: if we put a little extra effort into building the bridning, we have closer to an out of the box option for community members who need website for their projects - but want their website to talk to the rest of the community and other community members project websites.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Disadvantage:\u00a0<u>A LOT</u>\u00a0more work this week :)</li>\n\n</ul></li>\n\n</ol>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>\u00a0</h4>\n\n<h4>As usual in Edgeryders, those who do the work call the shots.\u00a0</h4>\n\nSo pick whatever you want to work on, assign it to yourself as a task in the Spot the Future group (there is a \"tasks\" button just below the group summary) so others know what is being taken care of, and run with it.

The initial goal was to create free software with education and academic programs embedded into it, which would be accessible to remote areas in Latin America for example (I have worked there for many years). </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>The longer I worked in some of the poorer countries, the better I understood that the pressing need is actually more basic - kids need good nutrition before they can go to school. And the ever present reductionist Model of Disease has to be changed into a holistic System of Health Promotion and Disease Prevention. There are various reasons why countries fail at providing the best care possible: too much privatization, too much technology supplanting good, basic policies. Doctors being more drug sellers than anything else. Omnipresent micro-specialization, which pushes medicine even more towards seeing a person as particular organs instead of a whole, complex, bio-psicho-social-spiritual being. </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>And so we shifted towards the creation of the System of Health, a system that would integrate care providers, institutions, individuals. A system rooted in the idea of Social and Integrative Medicine, which promotes education, good nutrition, family affection, physical exercise, and sanitary housing conditions, along with the state of the art innovations in the areas of precision medicine, (epi)genetics, bioinformatics, as the best and most sustainable public policies one can make. With this concept in mind, \u00a0</span><a href=\"http://health.gnu.org/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span>GNU Health</span></a><span> (any pronunciation is OK, but I like the concept of \"new\") was born in 2008.</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>A little bit later, GNU took its recent shape of </span><a href=\"https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/GNU_Health\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span>The Free Health and Hospital Information System</span></a><span>, which is available in a form of wiki - dynamic as the health (care) itself and consistently updated. It can be installed and used by hospitals, governments, institutions, under a free license. As health and care are parts of a complex, multi-etiological and anthropological issues, the system we\u2019ve created allows management and analysis of a huge amount of data and aspects: </span>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t<span>Individual and community management: demographics, domiciliary units, families, operational areas and sectors, ...</span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t<span>Patient management: Socioeconomics, lifestyle, encounters / evaluations, hospitalizations, lab reports, genetics, clinical history, ...</span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t<span>Health center management: Finances, stock, pharmacy , laboratory, Dx imaging, beds, operating rooms, appointments, supply chain management, human resources, \u2026</span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t<span>Information management: Reporting, Demographics and Epidemiology</span>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>Access to this information and ability to interpret and understand it is a precondition to an effective (health) care system, and it has to complement the work of nurses, teachers, mothers and fathers, social workers and doctors\u2026 Our role is to provide these institutions with a system capable of handling and processing huge amounts of data, and based on these findings - craft optimized prevention and deploy effective teams to tackle challenges. Our maps, for example, can show in real time spots in which the outbreaks of dengue happens, allowing for fast reaction. But it does much more than that - it shows the relations between health and family violence and teenage pregnancy. It underlines social determinants. It grasps the relations between economy and well-being. </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>Later on, we have added more functionalities, for example, Universal Patient\u2019s ID that supports centralisation of information about a person - this way you\u2019re not a new patient to each one of your doctors, but your story is accessible to health professionals.The ID does not allow the duplication of either individuals or patient medical history at the health center. On the upcoming features, the GNU Health Federation, will allow to aggregate information coming from multiple contexts, and </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>GNU Health is, in fact, a philosophy. It is about multidisciplinary communities with various tasks that contribute to more effective, more empathetic, more patient and health-oriented care. It\u2019s about a new mindset and a new attitude of health professionals, whose work cannot be efficient without a human approach to the patients and a deep understanding of their condition. Nutrition, exercise, prevention, information, empathy, affection, family, hygiene, education, technology, housing conditions - these and many more aspects have to be taken care of and supplement each other. </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>The system is being used in various places. In Argentina and Laos, it has been implemented by neurological and trauma rehabilitation and centers a few years ago. It is being installed in Argentina in districts to manage primary health centers. The Ministry of Health of Morelos, Mexico for the province. The biggest hospital in Laos, a reference in tropical diseases, runs on it as well. The government of Jamaica started a couple of years ago the implementation project for managing the Public Health system of the island.</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>These institutions and countries are independent now from proprietary solutions, which should be the integral principle in health care.

It's kind of working but I haven't yet established a decent workflow with it.\n\nI also tend to record a lot of conversations and have been paying for transcription at a reasonable rate but tend to only do this for things that make sense to publish - but that also requires substantial editing time.\n\nHaving grown up using a laptop (at the age of 11 I was told I was dsylexic and given a laptop as a *cure*), so I've always spent a lot of time online sharing my thoughts and engaging in online dialogue - but at some point in the last year I moved away from this. I find the information overload of platforms like twitter, slack and also at times EdgeRyders to be massively exhausting, and a cause for fragmented thought, both in terms of emotional intensity but also that a constant feed often infers an illusion of progress.\n\nI've found of late that a staggered trajectory of: informal conversation over time &gt; curated structured conversation on a subject derived from a longer running thread &gt; distilled into notes &gt; shared notes with time for reflection &gt; structured 2-3 day meet up focused on prioritisation and alignment &gt; assignment of tasks &gt; 1 week sprint &gt; publish. Derives much more successful results than the previous mode that I was operating in. This though obviously has it's pro's and con's.\n\nBy way of example this is an approach that has been taken with The unMonastery BIOS, and I anticipate with publication in a month or so time, we will be able to judge whether this process can yield sufficient results to justify it's relatively closed nature.\n\nAlso there's something worth noting that would benefit from more thought, there is clearly a problem within the transfer and distillation of tacit knowledge from those who do the heavy lifting in networks such as EdgeRyders and unMonastery. That due to the high workloads of those doing a substantial chunk of work from the start there is rarely time to skillshare, teach and pass on knowledge to newcomers, and this seems to grow exponentially overtime. This from my perspective is one of the main contributors to the concentration of power that (accidently) forms in networks that aspire to decentralisation and any form of horizontality. Classical institutions rarely suffer from this because clear hierachy also enables a structured means of transfering knowledge over time, we've also had many centuries to figure this out.\n\nToo often it seems that networked and distributed organisations form and grow around a set of personalities that hold everything together by maintaining an overview - as communities or responsibilites grow, the pressure intensifies and it becomes increasingly difficult to hold up the structure. Observing this from my experience with organisations over the last few years, I've begun to try and factor in an exit strategy as a part of the workload that is accounted for from the start. Whether that be through teaching, documenting specific aspects of great important or making sure to share external relationships key to the initiatives survival.\u00a0\n\n**Not as brief as I intended, hopefully it doesn't read as a ramble ;)\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-29 18:37:03", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:26.944164", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 709, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2551, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17088, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 6058, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Maybe a spreadsheet of funding opportunities with deadlines?</b>\n\nLike this it's hard to know how to allocate time... maybe people can tweet us using a hashtag (or we can tweet when we come across something elevant)?\n\n", "created_at": "2017-01-11 15:46:12", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:35.422994", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 41, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 1.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [16258], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31571, "user_id": 196, "topic_id": 1782, "post_number": 30, "raw": "<b>DREAM MATERA</b>\n\nHi Guys, as suggested by Ben I wrote a <a href=\"/t/dream-matera-5-things-ive-learned-about-codesign-from-norway-to-south-italy/1840\">post</a> about my thoughts.\n\nDo you think it is published in the right group?\n\nPlease let me know.\n\nThanks,\n\nFrancesco\n\n", "created_at": "2013-08-05 16:07:01", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:53.596192", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 59, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9509, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1507, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>This could actually work!</b>\n\nVery elegant solution!

I'm from a roof and three meals, though there were times when they had to come from the family garden. I came to discover EdgeRyders thanks to a series of unlikely events which began with the publication Aaron van Wirdum's interview with Vinay Gupta. I didn't know either of them but it was dropped on a mailing list and when I got through reading it the only word on the tip of my tongue was \"Hallelujah\", finally someone to speak reality to these people who think markets will fix everything. A few days later and almost entirely by accident, I heard about an event called SquatConf - a tech conference hosted in a squat, and it was right in Paris where I live! Looking at the list of names, I sensed an imminent party and there was no way I was going to miss it. I shot down to the IRC channel where the event was being organized and who do I meet?\u00a0Aaron van Wirdum and he's looking for a place to stay, I said sure thing and not one week later we were sitting in a proper squat and art\u00a0gallery. I had been reading everything I could about Vinay, being the first person I'd ever seen who was both compassionate and had an understanding of infrastructure, that lead me to discover EdgeRyders and at SquatConf a blond guy with piercing eyes sat down next to me and as we were talking, I asked him if he'd ever heard of EdgeRyders ... dumbest question in the world ... I was talking to Elf Pavlik.\n\nI describe myself as a \"protocol guy\". I spent the past 3 years developing cjdns routing protocol and I have come to see all human interactions as well as all machine interactions as matters of protocol. From Ethernet to \"thank you\" and taking one's shoes off at the door, every place where humans or machines interact with other humans or machines, we standardize protocols. Through this lens we can see politics, economics, law, language and everything that makes our world what it is, as a protocol.\n\nWhat excites me about EdgeRyders is that here there is a fundamental understanding of the necessity of management and infrastructure. Previously I have seen mostly libertarian orientated people who were capable of management and systems thinking but felt entitled to own everything they participated in building. Also there were communistic people who wanted a good world for everyone but, and there's no way to dress this up, could not manage their way out of a wet paper bag. Here it seems that people are having serious discussions about how we want to raise children and take care of the ill and elderly and also how we are going to get from where we are now to where we want to be.\n\nFundamentally I do not know where we want to be, I know we're going to need to try things for a while before something stands out as really working. What I do know is that in order to get anywhere, we are going to need to define protocols; systems of law, systems of economics, be they money based, reputation based, gift based or some combination of the three. This is what I do. Imagine the world you want, down to the most minute detail, understand the world you have without allowing your emotions to cloud your perception, then create a social virus which converts one into the other.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-11-21 07:18:03", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:22.014451", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 616, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856, 3, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22255, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1467, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Bring it on</b>\n\nThanks Andres.

It could do many things, but let's follow James's advice above (be sure to read his great comment)\u00a0and bootstrap it. This means focusing first on the thing that we can do <em>right now</em> \u2013 and in fact we are already doing; and expanding its scope later.\u00a0\n\nWe can manufacture (since Edgeryders 1) and sell (this only started in 2013) a novel\u00a0knowledge product, which is focused as consultancy, but open (hence legitimized, and truthful) as public consultation. I think this has a lot of potential to be\u00a0scalable, because it empowers individual edgeryders to steer the whole community into new projects.\u00a0\n\nLet's have an example here. Suppose you get interested in energy-independent communities. You get in conversation with, say, the City of Dublin, or an Irish energy utility company. The idea starts to develop to \"do something\" about the matter. Now, energy policy is the typical \"big government\" top-down kind of thing, crafted by professional experts at the top. It leaves no space for hacking \u2013 so, in a complex society, it has a high risk of being broken from the get go. At this point, you make your move: would you, City of Dublin or whatever,\u00a0be interested in an ethnography of energy-independent communities? We can drive a conversation between the best energy hackers in the world AND the\u00a0smart young citizens that would be the early adopters of any new way of doing things. We can figure this thing out in a way that marketing surveys and opinion polls can't, because we collectively turn the thing around in our head <em>and that generates new knowledge</em> \u2013 not just validates the existing one. Plus, we won't lie. If we think your idea sucks, we'll just tell you.\u00a0\n\nNow let's suppose the City of Dublin goes for it. At this point, you have made a sale. You have become the project leader of one Edgeryders campaign (or whatever we call them). You'll write a budget, accounting for your own time and that of people that need to be recruited (for example, en engagement manager: somebody with social media traction in that community, that can cnnect you to it). You will also account for a quota of the Edgeryders core services: the community website, community management to make sure the broader ER community gets on board, \\#LOTE etc. If you have paid gigs, you try to look within the community first for suitable candidates (without it being contrived, of course). You can \"be\" the Edgeryders social enterprise in that context \u2013 we found it gives an individual credibility when they present themselves as spearheading such an cutting-edge\u00a0and international community. I have seen this very clearly in Stockholm.\n\nThe beauty of this model is that we can do many of these things at once. While you work on energy, I could tackle a regional development issue. Matthias could get in the social currencies space, etc. Then, individual edgeryders will contribute according to their passions, knowledge and time \u2013 as always.\u00a0\n\nThis is for starters. Then, I don't see why \u2013 given the right circumstances \u2013 we could not do other things \u2013 European projects, for example.\u00a0\n\nBut all this needs me to complete the model, explaining what roles can individual edgeryders play in this story, and why they might want to do so. Have a little patience...\n\n", "created_at": "2013-03-28 10:52:28", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:37.005668", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 610, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 1.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [27917], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25689, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2121, "post_number": 14, "raw": "<b>Here's why</b>\n\nBecause, Michael, unMonasterians are to receive a per diem against their living expenses. This was baked in the proposal so that people could not have to think about making ends meet and focus on their journey in and with the unMonastery. Per diems are to be financed with a grant by Comitato Matera 2019, hence taxpayer money. So, we need to be seen as 100% fair and transparent in allocating these benefits. We created a public call; put it out there <a href=\"/t/unmonastery-matera-now-accepting-application-for-residencies/1804\">four months ago</a> on all relevant websites (ER, uM, MT2019) and pushed it out as best as we could. And indeed, applications flowed in \u2013 including some from the community: [elf Pavlik], [immaginoteca], [Kathleen], [mstn] and others. If we were now to say \"wait a minute, we did not want applications for <em>these</em> people, we wanted applications from <em>those other</em> people over there\" we would look like using public resources to distribute among our friends. If we keep applications open forever there is no way to defend ourselves from accusations of self-referentiality, if not discrimination. We did keep them open a good three months.\n\nAnd there needs to be an unAbbott for the same reason. No, the unMonastery is not \"a group of people coming to live together\": that would be any squat. The unMonastery is that, plus a social role: the local community, through the endorsement and support of the city hall, LOTE3 and other gimmicks, recognize unMonasterians as innovators-in-residence trying to solve problems of the local community itself. Back in the day, Ben, Nadia and others (mysel included) thought this would be crucial for the local context to embrace, rather than reject, the unMonastery transplant. So, to make this happen, we needed a local partner. We found one in Comitato Matera 2019; they are trusting us with a building, which is city property; cash resources; and legitimacy. We are accountable to them, and that means there needs to be someone that takes responsibility for the residency, and that someone needs to be paid and commits the full four months. Also, in the spirit of Benedict's rule, an unAbbott is a valuable service to the unBrethren (see the <a href=\"/t/the-unmonasterian-s-expectation-management-primer/1902\">unMonasterian's expectation management primer</a>).\n\nThese are all conditions for MT2019 stepping in with a building and resources. They (and I personally) did the work of digging out resources, therefore we called these shots.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-11-11 09:36:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:21.842201", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 433, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [25677], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28547, "user_id": 1487, "topic_id": 1934, "post_number": 12, "raw": "<b>purpose</b>\n\nI've been following your writings from Africa and they seem to be resonating with newfound clarity.\n\nI understand and agree with almost everything you've written ... there's much we can talk about ... but it already feels like a mature direction and I believe that further refinements will come through more and more doing.\n\nHowever I feel there is one aspect that is still missing. You've spoken of what EdgeRyders IS but I would like to talk about the PURPOSE of EdgeRyders. This isn't a dialectical excercise. I offer this for reflection:\n\n<blockquote>\n\n\"The purpose of EdgeRyders is to make cutting-edge knowledge available to mainstream society.\"\n\n</blockquote>\n\nA lof of the things that \"EdgeRyders is\" are not unique to EdgeRyders ... people are doing and researching and collaborating and communicating all over the world. However I believe that the effort to bring all this into mainstream society (the business model discussion) is a unique cutting edge of EdgeRyders. Speaking from personal experience, I live kind of like a monk in my unofficial unmonastery. I do lots of applied research however I do not (for numerous reasons) make an effort to make it public knowledge (other then publishing it online). That is where EdgeRyders comes in with a unique offering to both me (being part of a commmunity, make a living, etc.) and to mainstream society (finding ways to connect, organizing information and knowledge, creating circumstances for relevant applications, etc.).\n\nI believe that a clear purpose (the one above is just my suggestion) can offer loads of guidance and clarity into decision making. Here are some examples, based on this purpose:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>The public website should appeal first and foremost to the kind of people who we believe we can reach and work with in mainstream institutions.</li>\n\n<li>The public website is a tool to support the work of people like you Nadia who are trying to find a business model that will provide the financial breathing space needed to sustain EdgeRyders.</li>\n\n<li>The public website is not just a side-effect of leaking information from the internal platform.</li>\n\n<li>Maybe we can call these mainstream people \"potential customers\"?</li>\n\n<li>Maybe we need to all (as a community) care about potential customer - to remember that maybe they are not EdgeRyders (though they may be perceived as such within their context of life/work). Maybe we can adapt and moderate our internal forms of expression when expressed externally so that potential clients can better connect with us.</li>\n\n<li>Maybe we need to figure out (or make assumptions) about what we can gift to potential customers that will make it easier for them to digest EdgeRyders and to \"sell\" (on our behalf) it inside their organizations.</li>\n\n<li>Maybe projects that we do inside EdgeRyders can be considered for their value in the context of this purpose. Compatible projects can be presented with more focus and clear presentation to the outside world.</li>\n\n<li>Maybe this purpose can bring clarity and guidance to projects taking place within the community?</li>\n\n<li>Maybe there are projects that we can initiate - such as tools that enable our customers to interact with our community? Maybe such tools can empower our community AND create a unique value offering to our clients AND in doing so create income to sustain ourselves?</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen I moved to living in a Romanian village I was worried about money and so are a lot of people who I've spoken to about making a similar transition. The underlying question of this view is \"how/from where can I get money\".\u00a0 I didn't have and still don't have answers to that. But once here we launched a CSA (community supported agriculture project) with some features unique to the cultural setting we found here ... and the project has created a small, reliable, growing (with much potential) revenue stream for us. So now, when asked, I offer this as a reflection: instead of asking what you can take ask yourself what can you bring and offer to the village?\n\nAlmost everything you wrote was self-serving - the self being the EdgeRyders community. Yet you have been investing quite a lot of work in serving those that are outside the community - reaching out to our potential customers - but that part is not reflected in what you wrote and I believe that is the core of EdgeRyders and the key to its abundant sustainability.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-10-05 07:46:29", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:37.250043", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 773, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [28029], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28243, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 5938, "post_number": 11, "raw": "<b>Happy to ditch it </b>\n\n:)\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-10-22 20:36:38", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:35.693739", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 9, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20853, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 3269, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>bi weekly meet-ups!</b>\n\nHi Andy!\n\nSorry that I missed this post (I was a bit out for the past 3 weeks).

This is bringing business approaches, business technologies, to government.</em>\n\nCitizens throughout Europe, throughout the world, are engaging with government leaders to build solutions to problems that impact citizens in their home towns. The motivation is to improve the lives of citizens, the efficiencies of government, locally, where the impact can be most strongly felt.\n\nIs your community already leveraging open government practices or technologies?

Examples of such practices are publishing public sector information (budgets, salaries, environmental data etc.) to their web sites, especially if this is done in reusable formats such as XML (open data); encouraging ciizens to use these data to build solutions and apps; deploying free software solution, like <a href=\"http://www.fixmystreet.com/\">Fixmystreet</a> or <a href=\"http://ushahidi.com/\">Ushahidi</a>, to allow citizens to report upon anything from job opportunities to potholes on city streets; using Internet technologies for leveraging high quality citizen participation to public decision-making.\n\nSome websites with useful information to get started:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://govinthelab.com/government-in-the-lab-open-government/\">Govinthelab</a></li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://personaldemocracy.com/europe\">Personal Democracy Forum Europe</a></li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://govinthelab.com/gobierno-abierto-et-datos-publicos-2/\" target=\"_blank\">Goberno Abierto y Datos Publicos</a> (Spanish)</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://www.gov20.de/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.gov20.de/</a> (German)</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://okfn.org/\">Open Knowledge Foundation</a></li>\n\n<li><a href=\"https://groups.google.com/group/spaghettiopendata?hl=en\">Spaghetti Open Data</a> (Italian)</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nIf you need additional help with this mission, don't hesitate to contact the team by leaving a message on the Edgeryders profile of the person you want to address.

We had the pleasure to meet Guido ( @GLS9000 ), who produces\u00a0scientific content at the <a href=\"https://www.diabetes.be/\">Diabetes Liga</a>.\u00a0\n\nGuido:\u00a0Insulin is very well organized in EU. Belgium is 14<sup>th</sup>\u00a0(out of 30) in the European index. The medicine doesn\u2019t cost much here. Pumps, sensors etc. come with the package patients get from convention centers. The Diabetes Liga\u00a0sells some stuff like glucometers, sensors, strips. It doesn't make sense to sell other stuff, since they get it cheaply from convention centers. The convention centers are an intermediary between hospitals and the government health services.\n\nMaria (@mboto ): it's the same in Spain, it's almost free.\n\nGuido: The problem is clearly different in the US vs. here. In the US the price is a problem. Here the problem is more type 2 diabetes, specifically the\u00a0prevention, as it's a lifestyle diseases. Many organizations work on that. Diabetes still costs the government way too much money because of it: checkups, dietary stuff, ... Type 2 diabetes here is also tied to poverty. The best way to reach these poorer people is the doctor, but they usually have no time.\n\nMaria: it would be best to focus on this type, because it\u2019s an actual problem here. It\u2019s hard to reach these poor groups, we could help there. An art project would be a good medium in general to spread awareness to the public.\n\nThrough the non-profit Ekoli, we do come into contact with poorer and vulnerable groups of children in Belgium. This ties in with the idea of @NiekD \u00a0for <a href=\"/t/open-insulin-educational-outreach/6201\">educational outreach</a>. It would be a way to assist with the pressing matters here.\n\nVincent: <em>someone</em> is paying for the insulin here. Probably tax payers. Guido: yes, there are intermediaries that gain a lot from the government. In the US that is much more. There was a scandal not too long ago: big companies were making deals. Walmart is now also bringing back an old version of insulin to sell it cheaper. People here are spoiled though:\u00a0they are always asking for faster, better insulin. They wouldn\u2019t settle anymore for older types.\n\nOther info around the Diabetes Liga. They have about 80.000 patient members and 2.000 professionals. The members determine what the organisation does, and cheaper insulin simply isn't a policy point here. Guido mentioned the Open Insulin project at the office, but it was not a priority at all.\n\nPieter will design some infographics that can be used for communicating about the issues surrounding diabetes/insulin. The International Diabetes Foundation has some good ones already, these can be used as well or serve as\u00a0a starting point.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>Thanks a lot\u00a0Guido for the interesting input! I'm\u00a0interested to hear what others think. How can we shape the project so that it also meets the needs of the Belgium situation?</strong>\n\nThe next gathering is in two weeks: Wednesday 10 May at 8pm @ ReaGent\n\n<a href=\"/t/openvillage/788\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/ad08bad218fe3b37bf9f66ec63da8536160ba284.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"85\">\n\n</a>", "created_at": "2017-04-28 07:43:21", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 04:53:58.336046", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 593, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 2725.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2551], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14349, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 4393, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Updating with changes:</b>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>2 - 4 June: Alberto's meetings in Cairo</li>\n\n<li>4 June afternoon: small community event in Cairo</li>\n\n<li>6 June fly out to Rabat</li>\n\n<li>8 - 10 June: Alberto's meetings in Rabat.

See below for details and initial thoughts. All comments, remarks, suggestions, questions very welcome.\u00a0\n\n<strong>UNBREXABLE: CONNECTIONS AND CARING IN EUROPEAN SCOTLAND</strong>\n\n<strong>Overview</strong>\n\nIn the post-Article 50 period of political upheaval and uncertainty, actively forging and nurturing connections between communities and social movements is essential, both within Scotland and across the rest of Europe. In doing so, we affirm our status as part of the European community of nations, and explore the alternatives to a neoliberal and British nationalist hard Brexit.\n\n<em>Unbrexable </em>is an active response revolving around supporting and strengthening the kinds of emotional connections and caring- and grassroots European solidarity- which are too often left out of political debates. Human-scale intimacy and relationships have been diminished in current political and mainstream media discourse, with European Scots reduced to 'bargaining chips' with uncertain futures instead of valued and loved citizens with a right to belong. It has led to a coarsening of debate, and an understanding that we can no longer take for granted the kind of inclusive welcoming European Scotland we desire and voted for: we have to actively co-create it.\n\nIn this series, we offer a place for reflection, analysis and action, with an emphasis on effective collaboration and hospitality. From our base in the diverse community of Govan, Glasgow, we will carry out a series of roundtables, cultural happenings, and a one-day conference. All events will be documented by video or audio outputs and blogposts which will be disseminated. This will ensure a) each session is summarised and shared, and b) European Scots (those who hosted/ spoke or performed at roundtables or cultural events and conference) are invited to reflect on what connections and caring mean to them in a European Scotland today. The desired outcomes will be not only the events and an archive of digital resources documenting the activity, but an increased sense of care and connection, and an understanding of possible ways to effectively move forward, for the participants and attendees.\n\nThe series will have a strong emphasis on being led by European and other migrant Scots, especially those marginalised and most affected by Brexit: 'nothing about us without us is for us'.\n\n<strong>Events/Timeline</strong>\n\n<strong>May-July 2017</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>three roundtable discussions led by European Scots or colleagues from elsewhere in Europe offering valuable and unique insight into our current situation</li>\n\n<li>two cultural happenings/ arts workshops with or by European Scots, curated to reflect intercultural connections between societies and bioregions in Europe and celebrate the encounters between European traditions of art and music</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>August 2017</strong>\n\n\u00a0A one-day conference \u201cUnbrexable: Connections &amp; Caring in European Scotland\u201d held at the Pearce Institute in Govan.

As a listening experiment Edgeryders has already achieved more than we formally set out to do. <strong>On behalf of everyone on the team, thank you from the bottom of our hearts to everyone who contributed towards this!!!!</strong> Every mission report, every comment, every tweet makes a difference. <strong>By being on the Edge, people are providing valuable service to society.\u00a0 This service does not go recognised.</strong>\n\nThe Edgeryders project started with the Council of Europe and the European Commission wanting to understand one of Europe\u2019s most pressing set of issues: young (and not so young) people who navigate unstable environments, who question the return on investment of formal education, who don\u2019t have a space in labour markets or simply step away from traditional channels of political participation; basically those who do things that don\u2019t show up in statistics or official reports because there aren\u2019t instruments to measure the type of work they do. And so the Edgeryders distributed think tank was born: an open, online, highly interactive platform where people from all corners of Europe and beyond come together to meet one another, share their struggles and equally the creative solutions they find; and collect everything into a fresh vision of what the future may hold for young Europeans if the right instruments are in place to support their work. Over the last year we have come across multitudes of initiatives with experimental and alternative answers to the question of how we want to live in the future while facing enormous challenges (climate change, lack of resources, new forms of mobility, gentrification, unequal chances in the educational system\u00a0etc). We all agree that we need a lot of innovation to solve large urgent challenges like global warming,\u00a0ensuring food security, dealing with the fallout from financial crisis, upgrading our educational systems to better prepare our young. <strong>Radicalism is a cheap way to try new things that with small probability may work. But it costs a lot in personal terms to the individuals engaging in it.</strong> I have done many presentations like this one at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5ffVJRLAdk\">TEDx</a>\u00a0 where I mention some of the community members and initiatives we have come across. These initiatives are often precarious and lack long term perspectives. Most of the time they don't have access to political decision-making influencing their fate or even to a contact person in the political system.\u00a0 We are seeing this situation all over Europe with different levels or areas of government setting policies that fail to join up. The result being that citizens AND people working for institutions are trapped between policies that make competing, often contradictory, demands.\n\nRecommendations to policy makers are all good and well. However we cannot ignore the fact that <strong>policy instruments and processes to support the adoption of radical solutions to our most pressing issues are just not in place.</strong> If we want to be able to ensure that citizens and institutions have the means to be able to affect change and implement much needed creative solutions, we need to be sure that the processes and policy instruments that enable this are there. And If they don\u2019t exist we need to build them.\n\n<strong>Edgeryders came to play ball and we are not asking for permission.</strong>\n\nIt may not seem like it because institutions are slow and resistant to change but the Edgeryders project has already had an impact. So much so that the European Commission and Council of Europe are giving us a formidable challenge: <strong>breaking new ground in the fight against precarisation, social exclusion and poverty.</strong> This time the community is setting the agenda and pace, and are summoning the policy makers and other stakeholders to get in the game. It\u2019s really very simple: They can talk to people who are actually willing to engage constructively to serve the common good. Or they can deal with the other radicals when people lose patience with institutions' inabilities to deliver results.\n\n1) We\u2019re going to figure out how the community and different institutional actors including the Council of Europe and the European Commission can help individuals achieve local acknowledgement, unlock local resources and diffuse their ideas internationally.\n\n2) We\u2019re building a new platform driven and implemented by the community to better support the community members needs and facilitate collaboration on concrete initiatives. And to inspire and support those who are not yet aware of their capacity to improve conditions for themselves and others.\n\n3) We\u2019re going to position Edgeryders as a viable alternative for generating independent, democratically legitimate, high quality knowledge work on wicked problems. Bottom up.\n\n4) We\u2019re going to surface policy technicians who can help flesh out general recommendations into technically sound, pragmatic policy measures that cannot be dismissed for being unrealistic.\n\n5) We\u2019re going to turn Edgeryders into a powerful machinery for generating proof of concept of radical solutions. For getting them on the policy agenda and for creating the political willpower amongst competing politicians to adopt them.\n\nSave the date for the first week of December, let us know if you want to participate and if you\u2019re up for volunteering around one of the 5 goals above ( email us at edgeryders@gmail.com). Welcome aboard Edgeryders reloaded! It\u2019s going to be a wild ryde. \u00a0 <em>P.S if you're in the SPIRAL community of practice, this could be a great opportunity to put forward some challenges in your local environment that you would like the Edgeryders to help address.</em>\n\n", "created_at": "2012-10-26 09:55:34", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 17:02:30.892374", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1086, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 15601, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3043, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Live!</b>\n\nThe installation is live at http://edgeryders.edgesense.spazidigitali.com\n\n", "created_at": "2014-06-24 18:41:03", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:27.744437", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 15, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7910, "user_id": 1450, "topic_id": 3991, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Actually, this isn't so bad.

This is a company with members but no share capital, and is the classic form used by charities but also by trade associations and other membership organisations.\u00a0 It is as easy for someone in a different country to be a member as for a UK-based person.\n\nIf the organisatoin was going to be more entrepreneurial, then you could use a simple company limited by shares but this would probably create a barrier if you want grant funding.\u00a0\n\nThe Limited Liability partnership is also an option but I am not sure I would recommend it. I know Chris Cook is veryt keen on them and I believe he has identified very exciting uses for them but for mainly a membership organisation I am not convinced they are a good idea. And you would have the same issue with potential grant funders since the LLP is a \"for-profit\" form. Also it isnot geared up to be a membership organisation. Apart from anything else, if someone from outside the UK is a partner they'd be expected to file tax returns in the UK. Might not be a big deal but do you need it?\n\nAs for decision-making, this is a whole field of study. In brief, I would say this:\n\nThe limited company carries lots of historical baggage since it has been used for centuries for capital to dominate labour and the planet. Yet it is very flexible - you can use it for all sorts of purposes, and tweak the governance in all sorts of ways.\n\nThere are lots of ideas around \"decision-making withour hierarchy\", as embodied by Linux, for example, or perhas Wikipedia, or W Gore (makers of Gore-tex). To summarise this vast area, t<span>he underlying theme seems to be a recognition that individuals are capable of responsible, autonomous behaviour, without external control. This points towards: </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:\n\nArial\" lang=\"EN-US\">\u00a0<span><span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span></span><span>minimal, and flexible, hierarchy;</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:\n\nArial\" lang=\"EN-US\"><span>-<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span></span><span>no or few managers;</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:\n\nArial\" lang=\"EN-US\"><span>-<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span></span><span>leaders, and groups, appear and disappear as the need requires;</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:\n\nArial\" lang=\"EN-US\"><span>-<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span></span><span>information flowing freely; and</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:\n\nArial\" lang=\"EN-US\"><span>-<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span></span><span>a \u201chigher authority\u201d, having legitimacy amongst the group, holding everything together through application of wisdom and moral authority, without ego and without controlling anything. </span>This is about servant leadership, or trusteeship perhaps.\n\nIf you were to use the company limited by guarantee, you could certainly tweak the governance to encourage the development of this sort of culture of decison-making.\n\nI trust that is of some help. As a member fo the community I support what you are trying to do. I am afraid I don't have a lot of time to commit but am happy to chip in with advice from time to time.\n\nPatrick\n\n", "created_at": "2012-11-17 05:31:11", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:59.714747", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 874, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19491, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 3027, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>I don't know.</b>\n\nThe questions you pose are deep and very important.

In it I presented two areas where I believe culture can play an important role. The first is in helping us to succeed in undermining the rise of authoritarian movements in our societies. This in turn is depends on the second area: helping use to bridge the gaps between need for making a living and need for meaning. I believe that successfully addressing both is a key to getting us out of this mess we are in.</span></span>\n\n<span><span>Poverty of imagination in combination with lack of access to working models for how people can sustain themselves outside the full time long term employment paradigm creates a vacuum. A vaccum which authoritarian leaders can fill with whatever empty promises they like.

If we don\u2019t find new ways of sustaining ourselves that don\u2019t contribute towards people having to flee their countries in the first place, then we will never get out of the international cycle of stupidity. But change is hard. This is established by now. What is not so obvious is<em> how</em> culture can be channelled towards helping fix the problems. I\u2019d like to propose two statements as a starting point for a conversation: </span></span>\n\n<ol style=\"margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>Through culture we can shape new understandings of value, meaning, and work. Which in turn can improve our ability to use innovation against systemic crises.</span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>Through culture we can also influence how politics is done, where and by whom. Which in turn can build  the political and institutional demand for innovation against systemic crises.</span></span>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\"><span>Let me try to unpack this.....</span></h2>\n\n \n\n<h2 class=\"rtecenter\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:18pt;margin-bottom:17pt;\"><span><span>Change often begins at the edges of what is deemed acceptable - culturally, economically and legally</span></span></h2>\n\n \n\n    <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://designobserver.com/media/images/37567-chart_525.jpg\" style=\"width: 525px; height: 388px;\">\n\n<span><span>Image source: the German Advisory Council on Climate Change (WGBU)</span></span>\n\n \n\n<span><span>Even though this initial input is needed by the mainstream in order to adapt, our societies seem to be moving towards increasingly authoritarian cultures which react aggressively towards any kind of departure from the norm. This aversion to new alternatives seems to get worse when people are scared about their personal socioeconomic security. </span></span><span><span> And it makes sense. In our contemporary lives everything is defined in relation to work.</span></span>\n\n<span>Culture guides our behaviour. </span><span>You need to have the cultural space for something to exist in order for us to be able to recognise, interact with, and shape our values around it. If you want to very tangible example of this, have a look into the relationship between futurism and the rise of facism in Italy. </span><span><span>This is why I believe our ability to use innovation against systemic crises is limited by our ability to shape new cultural understandings of value, meaning, and work. </span><span>If you adopt this view, one conclusion is that responding to global systemic crises boils down to coming up with new ways of <a href=\"/en/the-edgeryders-guide-to-the-baltic/the-regeneration-of-meaning\">bridging the growing gap between the need to make a living and the need to create meaning</a>.</span><span> </span></span>\n\n \n\n<h2 class=\"rtecenter\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:18pt;margin-bottom:17pt;\"><span><span>Our ability to use innovation to resolve systemic crises is limited by our ability to influence </span><span>how </span><span>politics is done, where and by whom. </span></span></h2>\n\n<span><span>In this </span><a href=\"http://motherboard.vice.com/read/swedens-minister-of-the-future-explains-how-to-make-politicians-think-long-term\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span>Vice interview with Kristina</span></a><span> Persson, the current Swedish minister of Nordic cooperation and Future Issues, it is clear that she is interpreting her ministerial role as one that strives to </span><span>change the culture within which political and institutional decision makers act</span><span>. This is not a coincidence. Three years ago, Kristina commissioned a project from Edgeryders: an open conversation around issues of employment, migration and political participation grounded in first hand accounts of self selected participants living in different parts of the Baltic Sea region. We then had scholars point to the ruptures between how insitutional culture understood and approached challenges...and the lived reality of those whom they are meant to serve. My summary of Edgeryders contributions is available </span><a href=\"http://documents.mx/documents/the-baltic-edge-pre-print-draft-excerpts.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span>here</span></a><span>. When we did public talks about this, our conclusions seemed to resonate with people regardless of age, profession etc. More recently I heard jesper Christiansen who heads Mindlab\u2019s research work describe something similar- that their role was to drive a change of instutitonal culture. </span><span>Culture can be seen as a key enabler in shaping the political and institutional demand for alternative solutions.</span><span>.</span></span>\n\n<h2 class=\"rtecenter\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:18pt;margin-bottom:17pt;\"> </h2>\n\n<h2 class=\"rtecenter\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:18pt;margin-bottom:17pt;\"><span><span>Culture is a powerful carrier signal for deeper changes in a community.</span></span></h2>\n\n<span><span>https://www.youtube.com/embed/RYl3kTkO8Mk?rel=0 </span></span>\n\n \n\n<em><span>Video of the announcement of the city of Matera as winner of European Capital of Culture 2019.</span></em>\n\n \n\n<span><span>It is also cheap and fast in comparison to other kinds of intervention. So it makes sense to better understand how we can work effectively with and through culture to \\#unfail our approach towards dealing with the rise of authoritarianism and violent extremism. A first step is to push for an interpretation of the</span></span><span> <a href=\"/t/8-moves-that-worked-for-matera-to-win-the-european-capital-of-culture-2019-title/3959\">production of culture as a participatory process</a>. </span>\n\n<div> </div>\n\n<h2 class=\"rtecenter\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:18pt;margin-bottom:17pt;\"><span><span>Once you are on board with the thinking- </span><span>how </span><span>do you translate it into effective investments of time and money? </span></span></h2>\n\n<span><span>This requires</span><span> </span><span>widespread knowledge of administrative plumbing and workflows that allow for new ways of doing things. Brickstarter produced this report in which they describe really well why we need to shed light on what they call the \u201cdark matter\u201d around doing anything new if it involves dealing with large organisations (in their case public administrations). Meaning: we need to learn from previous efforts to hack administrative processes and introduce new ways of working. </span><span>Do you know of individuals who can share their experiences of having to come up with new administrative workarounds to implement relevant polices? </span></span>\n\n \n\n \n\n<h2 class=\"rtecenter\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:18pt;margin-bottom:17pt;\"><span><span>Wait but what happens in the long run? Oh oh... the stewardship problem</span></span></h2>\n\n<span><span>In order for us to be able to really tackle major challenges that require long term work we need to figure out how to improve the odds of creative initiatives being around long enough for us to see the results. Clearly, an initiative is a lot more resilient if it has a community behind it. Even though we know that networked communities are capable of tacking large and ambitious tasks like providing care services, or caring for public assets there is a huge market failure when it comes to stewardship:</span></span>\n\n<iframe class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"600\" id=\"doc_54620\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.scribd.com/embeds/263421647/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=slideshow&amp;access_key=key-nsc4DqPeVgaG5GC7o0G1&amp;show_recommendations=false\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n\nEven when it comes to culture in the form of immaterial assets, there are many examples of how quickly achievements can be unravelled without provisions being made for stewardship. Exhibit At being what happened in Matera in the aftermath of the elections. I'll leave it to @ilariadauria  to explain this if anyone is interested :)\n\n<span><span>One of the key obstacles to sustainability of creative initiatives, and the individuals who drive them, is lack of access to permanently affordable spaces for living and working in urban environments. If we could come up with credible models for securing and stewarding material assets then that can unlock a lot of creative resources and investment. So we ought to bring together people who have hands on experience from relevant initiatives: both failed and successful ones.</span></span>\n\n<h3 style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:16pt;margin-bottom:17pt;\"><span><span><em>This was a first attempt at weaving together insights from different discussions we have been having in Edgeryders over the years into a coherent idea for how culture can help us unfail in our response to terrorism and authoritarian movements.
