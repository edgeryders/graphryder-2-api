It feels to me hard to think about large scale change, but seeing a progression makes me more hopeful than at time zero, if that means much.\u00a0If Edgeryders is anything of a counter culture movement, than it is also true that from the beginning the position was to open\u00a0channels for collaboration between very diverse people.

Do you think that studying (and therefore having a decent job as you said, a decent income) can make you happy eventually?</strong></div><div>N: Not necessarily.

Why I do study is to show other people that I have a certain intellectual \"luggage\", to be acknowledged for what I'm worth.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div><strong>Me: But you just said that you study because by studying, you are confident that one day, you'll afford what you can't afford today. Isn't that a question of happiness?</strong></div><div>N: Umm..I don't jump with joy, but sometimes I wish my parents had more money to let me go on trips abroad or buy many things without always checking the bank account. Actually for me, higher education=good income. And with that, I could for instance buy myself a big house, where I feel good and where I feel happy.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div><strong>Me: so is it a question of happiness or not?</strong></div><div>N: It's more or less linked to it, but it's most of all a question of financial comfort.

Stronger than mine, in any case. I uploaded Maslow's pyramid of needs in order to show you that N's esteem needs are probably more important than the basic ones: the psychological and safety needs. Does this come from an inner lack of confidence? Was he intimidated by the way that I lead the conversation? I agree that I might have slightly manipulated the dialogue in order to get where I wanted.

Questo protocollo diventa una non-Regola, ma anche design (modellare gli spazi in cui avviene l'interazione significa influenzare le interazioni che in quegli spazi avvengono), le tradizioni di [Bembo Davies] etc.</li>\n\n<li>Alla domanda sui bisogni risponderei con le challenges, raccontando la storia dei workshops fatti in primavera. Di nuovo: concretezza e non fuffa, e in pi\u00f9 dai l'idea che il progetto lo stai gi\u00e0 facendo senza aspettare i loro soldi.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nPer ora mi fermo qui. Ma serve una riscrittura profonda IMHO.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-11-28 22:58:58", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:13.824561", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 452, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2752, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 2719, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<div class=\"node-content\">\n\n<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-full\">\n\n<div class=\"field-items\">\n\n<div class=\"field-item even\">\n\nThis is an overview of what came out of \\#futurespotters workshops in the form of rough documentation posts and video interviews.\n\nIf you were there and/or are thinking of ways to move forward and collaborate, don't hesitate: leave a comment in the posts below or upload your own reflections in the <a href=\"/t/futurespotters-workshops-the-aftermath/567\">#futurespotters workshop aftermath group</a>.

href=\"https://maps.google.it/maps?q=matera+sassi&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=40.669151,16.610553&amp;spn=0.00861,0.021136&amp;sll=40.672566,16.60429&amp;sspn=0.068874,0.169086&amp;t=m&amp;z=16&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=40.669151,16.610553&amp;panoid=qENRZXO2go37qA_qynh4EA&amp;cbp=12,326.56,,0,-9.78\">Matera</a>. OTS is\u00a0a community initiative offering free programming workshops and meetups to technology enthusiasts of all genders, backgrounds, and experience levels.\n\nDuring this time many workshops have taken place - in fact as I write this the space is being set up for a workshop focused on mapping tools. We'd like now though to expand its potential by bringing people with different skills to teach lessons and workshops. So if you've been thinking about visiting the unMonastery in Matera, perhaps now's the time?\u00a0\n\nThere are a few caveats, although we teach some workshops in part English and broken Italian, it's obviously a huge preference that you're capable of speaking some Italian, fluency is a major plus point. Next, the unMonastery is a heavily bootstrapped project meaning at this time we have enough budget to keep the lights on and stay fed but sadly we can't assist with travel expenses - you have to want to come :-). What we can offer though is food, a comfy bed, friendship and an interesting time at an exciting project only in its infancy.\u00a0\n\nIf this is something that appeals to you and you've got a skill to teach please get in touch through this <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1imDqSKQwlEMWzmSOAktbGhXyw3C7aPxAklIrayNPMa0/viewform\">visitors form</a> telling us what you could offer, we're thinking May, June and July - and if you've got questions please don't hesitate to comment here on EdgeRyders.\u00a0\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3730/12019558163_e651f82f16_o.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 398px;\">\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-26 14:06:07", "updated_at": "2018-06-01 06:17:39.292100", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 423, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14473, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2021, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>This looks like fun!</b>\n\n500 words for decade?

After some back and forth we came to the conclusion that what drives a lot of this happening is clear aims- things that people get excited about getting involved in. At first we thought about just printing talk to me bubbles, but realised that If you ask me what I want at the beginning of the event, it\u2019s probably very different from what I would say after. Because of all the new impressions, conversations, connections etc.</span>\n\n<span>So we are thinking of the printed materials as support to all the participants in a process that leads to our leaving the unMonastery already collaborating in realising things we are super excited about. Both with people who were physically there AND online with others who couldn\u2019t make it this time. We have come up with a list of materials to produce with links to the files to modify if we have them (from previous events). While in South Africa I came up with a visual metaphor to <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/177697673/Edgeryders-Business-Presentation-PostSouthAfrica\">explain what Edgeryders is/does</a> that is also consistent with the logotype.

That means 25-28 February 2016.\n\nWhat's missing is a schedule of our activities, and time is getting tight if we are to engage with other people out there (and we are). I propose we do two things.\n\n<strong>One day of talking</strong>. This would be a closed-door meeting for the consortium only. Closed-doors means we all are welcome to invite external people (for example with a view to future partnerships), but other than that we will just have a regular meeting. We will cover collaboration procedure and tools; admin; and detailed planning on the first six months of so of the project. We will also schedule the second consortium meeting.\n\n<strong>One day of doing</strong>. This would be an open-door event scheduled within LOTE5, which anybody can attend \u2013 the more the merrier. Call it the first of the OpenCare onboarding workshops. Here we have several possibilities. I see at least three very attractive things we could do:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>\u00a0<strong>Masters of Networks</strong>. A hackathon based on network methodology and data. <a href=\"/u/melancon\">@melancon</a>\u00a0and myself have some experience in delivering those \u2013 of course we would need care-related network data. See this short video to get an idea of what happens at Masters of Networks events.\u00a0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/2-9z0i5fuvE?rel=0</li>\n\n<li><strong>A workshop on designing community-driven care services</strong>. This could be led by <a href=\"http://www.shareable.net/blog/design-for-social-innovation-an-interview-with-ezio-manzini\">Ezio Manzini</a>.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li><strong>One or more talks to present the project by conveying the urgency of the issue</strong>. I would love a talk by <a href=\"/u/markomanka\">@markomanka</a>\u00a0on healthonomics, for example \u2013 how incentives are very seriously warped in this field. <a href=\"/u/lakomaa\">@Lakomaa</a>\u00a0might also have something to say in this respect: additionally, in Italy we found a health economist (works as a comptroller in the Italian public health system) called Simona Ferlini who has a lot of insider knowledge to contribute.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nMy preference would be for doing all of the above, and perhaps even more. Maybe <a href=\"/u/costantino\">@Costantino</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"/u/zoescope\">@zoescope</a>\u00a0can think of some maker-related stuff to do? But of course these things eat up time. There is no point in doing a hackathon in less than a full day's work, for example.

I'm still not sure how to summarise accurately my thoughts but I'll try to do my best.\n\nThe global financial system is agonising. This mass slavery monster is going to an end and i don't think that those who were part of it, and especially politicians who were supposed to protect us from such threats, will do anything else than doing something like the fake french revolution in 1789. They will build some other institutions, make some policies but they will not touch their own thrones. I mean they will make sure they can continue to have some control, some power.\n\nThe only thing i'd like to see Europe institutions do is to push forward a worldwide open debate about the real issues, the real problems which are at the core of our society. Something like : \"hey, we screwed up somewhere, we don't know exactly how or why, can you help us building something where these horrors would be structuraly impossible ?\"\n\nIt's something we've humbly tried to do with <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/spotlight-open-government/mission_case/d%C3%A9mopolitique-crowdsolving-tool\">d\u00e9mopolitique </a>: debate about the core of the society like capitalism which fuels our economy, our lives. I mean... Profit is something like the condition sine qua none to any business. If you just wanna help others, go volunteer and live in poverty, or get in a structure with less and less money each day and mountains of paper to fill in hope to get some cash.\n\nIn a discussion, we came to <a href=\"http://demopolitique.com/node/119\">conclusions and small proposals</a> meant to deal with roots of the problem at political levels. Proposals that have long been reclaimed by many citizens that only a few politicians voiced, because they are directly concerned by these.\n\nEurope is the birthplace of democracy. It's been an ideal for a while but I think it has failed its duty because of power. Our governments have not been strong or efficient enough to protect us from the greed of a few. We need to make sure this never happen again, and no law, policy or structure would be anything else than another bandage to temporarly stop the bleed.\n\nWe need to grow up as a society.\n\nWe can do better. We must do better.\n\nCitizens around the world are already building the future, preparing for the worst and dreaming for the best to all of us.\n\nOur global system is made of beliefs, it's a man-made structure.\n\nThere's nothing but ignorance that separate us from a society where money would be replaced by the intimate knowledge that we are One and that love is the most valuable thing.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-09-20 17:27:19", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:56.003235", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 516, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 574, "user_id": 3310, "topic_id": 541, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<span><strong>I</strong>n the following months few makers, designers and innovators will be invited as temporary collaborators to the project opencare and will live at <a href=\"http://wemake.cc/\">WeMake</a>. In the upper floor of the building there are two rooms, two bathrooms, a big open space with the kitchen and a balcony. The idea about <a href=\"/t/maker-in-residence/6148\">Maker in Residence</a> (MIR for short) is that -after a selection- chosen candidates will join WeMake and will get the proper on-site support to develop and accelerate their own project, if it fits to the opencare world.</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>So, here is a brief ethnography about some talks that emerged during the meetings to organize and plan MIR.</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/672786ee3eac7febd235c45007e3e36a9d2e473c.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"487\">\n\n<small class=\"noclass\">A meeting of the staff - from left to right: Alessandro, Chiara, Costantino, Francesco and Silvia</small>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>In the past weeks two of the most recurrent questions by the makers and the staff of WeMake have been: \"what is opencare? What does fall under this category?\" </span>\n\n<span>This came out during the drafting of the call and after reading the applications. You can read more about the call here: </span><a href=\"http://wemake.cc/opencare/maker-in-residence-en/\">http://wemake.cc/opencare/maker-in-residence-en/</a>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>Since the beginning it was clear that either designing an object, like doing \u201ccity guerrilla\u201d was certainly not corresponding to taking action about care.</span>\n\n<span>But \u201cif such an object is loaded by local care is opencare\u201d.</span>\n\n<span>Both have an impact on care about the territory, but the second does it with such a goal. It's not a matter of considering shared and open means, or connecting the health and the social.</span>\n\n<span>\u201cIt's a matter of meaning for us\u201d.</span>\n\n<span>\u201cWe found ourselves in many situations where this was absolutely not immediate to be understood\u201d.</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>About the call.</span>\n\n<span>During the early meetings the staff of WeMake discussed some issues came to discussion. The first one was: \u201chow broad is care?\u201d</span>\n\n<span>Understanding and agreeing on the extension of the concept of care seemed a very important point to put into achieve the MIR project. Although it seems quite a philosophical question, this had a very functional consequence: it made possible to draft the call and also to select the candidates.</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>A second discussion came on how much physical should have stayed the designed object.</span>\n\n<span>The call itself is based (it has a record) on the physicality (fisicit\u00e0) of the object, as it was a result of the main experience of WeMake with opencare, given that all services needed new design and that service and hardware may reach a ratio definitely in favour of the services (service 90%; hardware 10%).</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>\u201cEven if the prototyped object is not material, in a makerspace, a dash of impact for completeness is however needed on the project\u201d It has to do with the way makers think; very creative and very material thoughts are always in the air here. I feel lucky to follow and take notes and records of what is happening and how things are in the making about MIR initiative. I'm looking forward to discussing with the coming makers in residence about it.</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-08 09:51:10", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 04:38:26.084449", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1455, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12113, "user_id": 422, "topic_id": 1260, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>It's a Shine Some Light</b>\n\nYep, wrongly filed.

Ainsi suite \u00e0 cette r\u00e9gularit\u00e9 d'implication, mais \u00e9galement en m'investissant dans les AG (Assembl\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale) et dans les travaux, je suis \u00e9galement devenu membre du CA du Centre Autonome Jeune Molodo\u00ef depuis 1ans.\n\n<strong>Le Molodoi, c\u2019est quoi\u00a0?</strong>\n\nLe Molodoi ne se revendique pas comme une salle de concert, c\u2019est une salle auto-g\u00e9r\u00e9e associative qui a vocation \u00e0 d\u00e9velopper des activit\u00e9s culturelles et sociales. On peut r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement y voir\u00a0: des projection-d\u00e9bats, des discussions, des ateliers jeux, des repas mais aussi des pi\u00e8ces de th\u00e9\u00e2tre et principalement des concerts de tout genre (du post-rock en passant par le hiphop de l'electro en revenant sur la musique du monde, ou encore du reggae jusqu'au hardcore). Le lieu vie en fonction des projets des diff\u00e9rentes associations, ainsi tout type de projet tr\u00e8s \u00e9clectique y sont r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement propos\u00e9s. C\u00f4t\u00e9 du public, il peut autant y avoir des enfants qui viennent faire un spectacle que des personnes qui font la f\u00eate jusqu\u2019\u00e0 4h du matin.\n\nLe Molodo\u00ef accueil r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement plusieurs associations qui travaillent dans le social ou sur des projets humanitaires qui en organisant des \u00e9v\u00e9nements \u00e0 Molodo\u00ef r\u00e9cup\u00e8re des fonds pour leur propres projets (des assoc\u2019 comme CASAS ou Abribus...). En contrepartie Molodo\u00ef leur demande un retour direct sur les actions men\u00e9es avec les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices r\u00e9colt\u00e9s pendant leur soir\u00e9e.\n\nA Molodo\u00ef, tu ne loues pas un espace, le lieu est mis \u00e0 disposition pour un projet et en fonction de ton \u00e9v\u00e9nement tu fais un don \u00e0 la salle : \u00e7a peut \u00eatre un don financier (g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement 1/3 des b\u00e9n\u00e9fices) ; un don mat\u00e9riel (racheter du mat\u00e9riel cass\u00e9 \u00e0 Molodo\u00ef, lampe ; aspirateur...) ou un don humain (participation aux journ\u00e9es de travaux qui on lieu tout les derniers dimanche de chaque moi.\n\n<strong>Comment \u00e7a fonctionne\u00a0? </strong>\n\nAu Molodo\u00ef, il y a des AG [assembl\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale] tous les 1er\u00a0et 3e\u00a0mercredis du mois o\u00f9 des associations peuvent pr\u00e9senter leur projet. Pour pouvoir y proposer un projet, il faut s'investir et s\u2019int\u00e9resser \u00e0 Molodo\u00ef.\n\nLe Molodo\u00ef est en constante \u00e9volution parce que \u00e7a fonctionne avec les personnes qui sont l\u00e0 au moment o\u00f9 les choses doivent se faire. Il y a deux entit\u00e9s de d\u00e9cision. Il y a le coll\u00e8ge administratif compos\u00e9 de personnes avec des parcours diff\u00e9rents qui ont comme passion commune de d\u00e9velopper le lieu. Pour \u00eatre membre du CA [conseil d\u2019administration], il faut faire preuve d\u2019implication au lieu. Il y a des ouvertures du CA une fois par an \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re AG du mois de juin.\n\nN\u2019importe qui peu se pr\u00e9senter, en expliquant ces motivations par \u00e9crit et par orale assemble g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Le CA se r\u00e9uni en interne 1 fois par mois pour les d\u00e9cisions concernant la comptabilit\u00e9 et le salari\u00e9.\n\nSinon, toutes les d\u00e9cisions sur le fonctionnement sont partag\u00e9es avec le \u00ab\u00a0coll\u00e8ge de personnes\u00a0\u00bb ou CP qui est constitu\u00e9 de personnes qui s\u2019investissent dans la salle et sont pr\u00e9sentes dans le lieu r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement en tant que personnes et pas en tant qu\u2019association. Le CP est compos\u00e9 d\u2019une vingtaine de personnes. Au total, c\u2019est donc une trentaine de personnes qui dans les AG vote les projets, se met d\u2019accord sur la ligne de la salle, son d\u00e9veloppement, les choses \u00e0 faire...\n\nUne fois un projet accept\u00e9, il y a des r\u00e9f\u00e9rents (g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement une personne du CA et une autre du CP) qui accompagnent l\u2019association dans la r\u00e9alisation de son projet mais \u00e9galement pendant son \u00e9v\u00e9nement.\n\n<strong>Il faut s\u2019impliquer\u2026</strong>\n\nMolodo\u00ef fonctionne avec des b\u00e9n\u00e9voles et pour que \u00e7a puisse perdurer, il faut que des personnes s\u2019investissent. Lorsqu\u2019une association vient et qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas un projet bien ficel\u00e9, elle ne peut pas le pr\u00e9senter directement \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re r\u00e9union. Il faut d\u2019abord qu\u2019elle rencontre les personnes du lieu, pour discuter du projet. C\u2019est pour \u00e7a que l\u2019investissement dans les assembl\u00e9es g\u00e9n\u00e9rales est tr\u00e8s important. L\u2019autre chose importante, c\u2019est qu\u2019apr\u00e8s chaque projet, un bilan soit fait dans les trois mois qui suivent la soir\u00e9e, que les personnes reviennent en assembl\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale pour qu\u2019on puisse savoir comment \u00e7a s\u2019est pass\u00e9. Pour Molodo\u00ef il est tr\u00e8s important d'avoir un retour des associations. Et en fonction de comment c'est d\u00e9roul\u00e9 l'\u00e9v\u00e8nement, tu fais un don \u00e0 Molodo\u00ef.\n\nSi tu peux pas faire un don financier parce que ta soir\u00e9e n'a pas march\u00e9, tu peux venir aider \u00e0 changer des ampoules, repeindre les murs, refaire la toiture. On invite tout le monde \u00e0 venir les derniers dimanches du mois pour nous aider \u00e0 maintenir le lieu en \u00e9tat et ainsi le faire perdurer.\n\n<strong>Rendre les \u00e9v\u00e9nements accessibles, \u00e7a se traduit comment\u00a0?</strong>\n\nD\u00e8s le d\u00e9part, l\u2019id\u00e9e \u00e9tait de faire que la salle soit accessible pour tous donc il y a une barri\u00e8re de 50 francs qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9e comme prix maximum pour les entr\u00e9es. Maintenant c\u2019est 8 euro.\n\nA Molodo\u00ef la moyenne des prix est r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement autour de 5\u20ac mais il y a une pratique r\u00e9guli\u00e8re du prix libre pour les petits \u00e9v\u00e9nements.\n\n<strong>Qu\u2019est-ce que tu vois comme limites\u00a0?</strong>\n\nLe Molodo\u00ef est la seule salle, ouverte de cette mani\u00e8re au Association local, il y a donc beaucoup trop d'asso qui demande \u00e0 faire des \u00e9v\u00e8nements qu'il n'y a de jour dans un week-end.\n\nNous sommes souvent confront\u00e9 \u00e0 faire des choix entre 3 chouette projets et donc 2 qui ne verront pas le jour.\n\nL\u2019autre probl\u00e8me, c\u2019est qu\u2019il y a pas assez de personnes qui s\u2019investissent, par exemple, au niveau des travaux. Les gens ne se rendent pas toujours compte qu\u2019il y a des probl\u00e8mes de financement. Il y a r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement de la casse qu\u2019il faut remplacer ou r\u00e9parer (lampe/ toiture/ serrures/ toilettes...) et l\u2019ensemble de ces travaux sont r\u00e9alis\u00e9s par des b\u00e9n\u00e9voles. Les dons qu\u2019on re\u00e7oit permettent de g\u00e9rer le quotidien, acheter un frigo, un aspirateur, des tables...\n\nMais il y a certaines r\u00e9parations qui demandent un investissement plus lourd (sol / toit / \u00e9lectricit\u00e9...), et pour cela nous avons clairement un manque de financement.\n\nLes gens qui viennent en tant que public per\u00e7oivent parfois le lieu comme une salle o\u00f9 tu consommes les choses, alors que pas du tout, elle fonctionne avec les gens. N\u2019importe qui du public peut venir en AG pour lancer des id\u00e9es ou participer \u00e0 l'am\u00e9lioration du lieu.\n\n<strong>Un mot de la fin\u2026</strong>\n\nMolodo\u00ef \u00e7a demande beaucoup de temps, beaucoup d'investissement et il y a et aura toujours des petits soucis. A Molodo\u00ef, tout ne roule pas sur des roulettes mais ce lieu est une vrai chance \u00e0 Strasbourg, son fonctionnement est unique. Il dynamise aussi le tissu associatif, il y a beaucoup d\u2019associations qui voient le jour en organisant des\u00a0 projets \u00e0 Molodo\u00ef et en organisant des projets inter-associatifs, ce lieu favorise clairement l'\u00e9change et le partage des id\u00e9es et des connaissances de chacun.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-03-22 09:19:42", "updated_at": "2018-06-03 07:30:59.957840", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1451, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1311, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1278, "post_number": 1, "raw": "According to the following article by Colin Horgan (see the article below), I must be in the category of \"insiders\", although I do not really feel as being one.\n\nI have been passionate about politics for a long time. During my childhood, I watched the passion of my father. Later, politics caught up with me.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.corpothanato.com/photos/2009/2009-04-02/39301.jpg\">\n\nYves Robichaud (1930-2009)\n\nMy father, Yves Robichaud, was a general contractor in excavating. He build the Highway 40 connecting Montreal to the City of Quebec, over 300 kilometers of road. He build the concrete pylons that support the Laviolette Bridge, which links Trois-Rivi\u00e8res to the south shore, from one bank to another of the beautiful St. Lawrence River. My father, besides being passionate about Caterpillar, John Deer and other heavy machinery, talked about politics all the time. I grew up listening to stories of politicians. I used to visit shops of construction equipment around the country, where I accompanied my father in his business trips, from the age of 8 years old. Of course, the favorite topics of conversation were politics, along with heavy machinery, and hunting. I know as many good stories of caribou and bison as of politicians. Government officials were often invited for dinner at our house or for weekends at our chalet.\n\nMy father had three large garages for his excavating business, on top of owning a gas station, dozens of machines for excavation, and about half the land in the city of Trois-Rivi\u00e8res. He employed about thirty men, in addition to the contractors, such as 10-wheel trucks that carried day and night sand and rocks on construction sites.\n\nI realized from a very early age, that in order to earn a living, entrepreneurs in construction had no choice but to stay very close to the politicians. My father attended many political events. He knew the Prime Minister of Canada and of Quebec, MPs, and was aware of every government decision. General election days were very dramatic in my family. I cannot forget the day when the Liberals lost their elections, and the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois won in 1976. I thought my father had turned mad, mad with rage.\n\nI have never built links with a political party in particular. However, I developed relationships with all parties at once.\n\nWhen I became an adult, I wanted to make art. Not politics. I became interested in government business the day I received a tax bill of $ 3000 for an artist's studio of 300 square feet. I lived in this small studio, and was taxed as a business. This is how my relationship with elected officials began, and they never really stopped since.\n\nSince I have been 25 years old, the people I think about the most, who are constantly before my mind as a kind of screen saver, have been politicians. They are so close to my thoughts that I can almost read their minds.\n\nI have always gone directly to the elected members of parliament or of city council. Most of my interventions aimed at this audience, not to government managers, who have little room to maneuver.\n\nIn the past, I was able to influence enough to change the law. Although I am not a lawyer, I can read the legislation and see where are the 'holes'. Intuitive in nature, this played me tricks more than once, because I demanded changes even before having the arguments to explain my complaints. Often, I gathered the pieces of the final arguments through my discussions with officials, members of the community and reporters.\n\nI continue to act in the same way I always acted. But this does not give anymore results.\n\nBefore, I managed to achieve goals by obtaining the support from organizations. For example, an artists' association elected me as their president (I was therefore the designated spokesperson), while another association hired me to financially support my lobbying.\n\nIn the case of open government, there is nothing, no group, no institution, which exists in this area, which could be contacted and asked to provide support and funding. There is nothing at all.\n\nAs a simple citizen - just a citizen, it is beyond my financial capacity to fund the development of open government throughout Francophonie out of my own pocket. I would love to be able to do it. If I were a millionaire, I would happily build structures for development of open government everywhere. But this is not the case, unfortunately, I have no personal fortune. My father lost everything he had after the 1976 election. Such a financial burden should not be carried by the citizens. The government should invest money towards its own transformation into a new form of governance.\n\n************************\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>Politically disengaged Canadians not apathetic or uninformed, study finds</strong>\n\nWed, Dec 7, 2011, 12:45 pm by Colin Horgan, iPolitics\n\n<a href=\"http://www.ipolitics.ca/2011/12/07/politically-disengaged-canadians-not-apathetic-or-uninformed-study-finds/\">http://www.ipolitics.ca/2011/12/07/politically-disengaged-canadians-not-apathetic-or-uninformed-study-finds/</a>\n\nPolitically disengaged Canadians may seem disinterested, apathetic or uninformed, but they are actually politically aware, but believe the system doesn\u2019t work for them, according to new research from Samara.\n\nThe study,\u201dThe Real Outsiders: Politically disengaged views on politics and democracy\u201d, was released by the citizen engagement research organization Wednesday.\n\nWhile Samara admits that \u201cno study, no matter how nuanced or far reaching, can fully explain all the complex factors that determine how we relate to our political system,\u201d its research shows a \u201ctroubling situation.\u201d\n\nCanada\u2019s political system has, according to Samara, \u201cseparated the Canadian public into insiders who have the capacity and energy to fight and remain engaged in the system, and outsiders who simply walk away out of frustration or disappointment.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe study was based on eight focus groups, two made up entirely of women \u2014 one of Francophone women from Quebec, and another of English-speaking Quebec women. The researchers also spoke with groups made up of lower-income Canadians, less-educated young people, urban aboriginals, new citizens and rural Canadians. A group of engaged Canadians was also included for comparison.\n\nSamara asked why and how individuals became disinterested in the political process.\n\nBoth engaged and disengaged Canadians were found to have a negative view of politics, and used words including \u201cboring,\u201d \u201cgreedy\u201d or \u201cuntrustworthy\u201d when describing Canadian politics. Similarly, politicians received the same treatment.\n\nAt the same time, Samara found participants still liked democracy and the rights and freedoms that come with it.\n\n\u201cEven disengaged participants, who admitted they did not regularly exercise their rights, described democracy in terms of freedom of expression and their right to vote,\u201d the study found.\n\nThe problem is, those concepts remain abstract and Samara found that disengaged Canadians see no place for themselves within the political system.\n\n\u201cThe disengaged never spoke of the political system as if it belonged to them,\u201d says the study. \u201cThey never felt that they had any power to influence or control what happens inside the political system. Instead, they viewed themselves as passive observers of politics \u2014 not by choice, but simply by virtue of their place as outsiders.\u201d\n\nFor the disengaged, politics is not a priority and not worth the energy when there are other personal matters to deal with. It\u2019s rendered effectively irrelevant.\n\nWhile some of those who were disengaged became that way after a bad experience \u2014 for example, attempting to affect change locally and finding little progress by contacting politicians \u2014 the study found others who were \u201ctaught the futility of engagement before they even had a chance to engage.\u201d That was particularly true among less-educated youth.\n\nThat feeling, says the study, was reinforced by messaging that failed to speak to them. As a result, they expect little from their government.\n\nAs for the solution, it\u2019s complex, the study said.\n\nThe study admits a solution will \u201cnot likely come in the form of a silver bullet.\u201d However, it points to the media, Parliament and political parties as all having a role to play in reinvigorating the system, based on the findings.\n\n\u201cThere is a silver lining to our research,\u201d says Heather Bastedo, research and project director at Samara. \u201cDisengagement is reversible given the right conditions, and Canadians told us they are not asking for much. They simply want to feel heard, they want their problems to matter and they want promises kept \u2014 they want to feel represented.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-16 21:20:50", "updated_at": "2017-09-21 11:42:46.251188", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1539, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 20.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32251, "user_id": 1933, "topic_id": 2953, "post_number": 36, "raw": "welcome @saidhamideh,\n\nsure I can, here it is:\n\n\"\u054a\u0561\u0570\u0561\u0576\u057b\u057e\u0578\u0582\u0574 \u0565\u0576 \u0570\u0561\u0575 \u0576\u0578\u0580\u0561\u0580\u0561\u0580\u0576\u0565\u0580\"\n\n", "created_at": "2014-05-23 17:52:10", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:57.223216", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 18, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [32230], "is_liked_by": [115], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18896, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 4546, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>I can make you one :)</b>\n\nEdgeryders style :) Just remind me.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-30 06:02:12", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:45.311850", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 14, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [18789], "is_liked_by": [2201], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24074, "user_id": 514, "topic_id": 4118, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Political level - How do we build a political case and sell it</b>\n\nHi all,\u00a0\n\nIn response to <a href=\"/t/shaping-a-new-agenda-for-europe-promoting-investment-in-distributed-architectures/4126\">THIS</a> post on Edgeryders I think building a political case is very important. We need to make it real, to show how p2p makes a difference in people's lives. I have more than 5 years experience in peer production, as a practitioner and as a designer of new economic models and of the infrastructure to support commons-based peer production. I know first hand what works, as well as the areas that need attention. I can also help in explaining and demonstrating how peer production helps the local economy.\u00a0I operate within www.sensorica.co and I am one of the main architects for the open value network (OVN) model.\u00a0\n\nI can associate with\u00a0open knowledge,\u00a0open hardware, open networks (as in value networks).\u00a0\n\nOne of our biggest challenge is to put in place processes to transfer global digital commons into local economies, in a sustainable way: open source innovation, which is a global process, produces digital commons in the form of designs, methods and protocols, etc. which can be used to solve local problems. Currently, the economic activity generated from the global commons is enclosed within classical organizations and the benefits that are generated are not redistributed back to the global open innovation network. There is a problem with the value flow between open source innovation and the economic activity that results from it, and that makes open source communities struggle to stay alive. Our understanding of the current reality is obscured by some very large and healthy ecosystems like Arduino (in the hardware realm), Linux and Android (in the realm of software). The truth is that most open source projects are supported by a small number of individuals who are struggling. The sum of these projects represent the bulk of open source development. The problem is that these open source initiatives lack effective mechanisms to capture the value they create. This value is captured by classical entities that are essentially parasitic to the open source movement. This is not sustainable. The tension between open source communities and corporate structures that capture the value they create is real, as it is illustrated in the <a href=\"http://printthefilm.com/\">case between RepRap and Makerbot</a> (3D printer manufacturer). Some see open source development and business as two separate things. Some can't see beyond classical business models and think that the conflict between open source innovation and classical ways to monetize that value is just normal. We think that this is only a transient\u00a0anomaly during a phase of economic transformation. We think that the new open source mode of innovation is currently evolving its own means of sourcing (crowdsourcing), production (extreme manufacturing and other distributed manufacturing models) and distribution, as well as its own mechanisms for redistribution of benefits (the <a href=\"http://valuenetwork.referata.com/wiki/Main_Page\">open value network model</a> and others like it).\u00a0<span>\u00a0</span>\n\nThese new economic models to transfer global commons into local economies in a sustainable way need to be refined in pilot projects, and they need infrastructure. The <a href=\"http://www.p2pvalue.eu/\">p2pValue</a> project is a good step in that direction, but only the first one. \u00a0This issue was also at the core of the\u00a0<a href=\"http://p2pfoundation.net/FLOK_Society_Project\">FLOK society project</a>.\n\nI can also associate with the Internet of Things (IoT), since SENSORICA's mission is about sensing and sensemaking. We advocate and help build a distributed IoT.

Did you take any decision at the end of the workshop?\n\nEach partner has its own perspective and one of the challenging aspects of the project is \u201cmultiplicity in unit\u201d, as Alberto wrote some days ago. <span><span>For this</span> <span>I am trying to</span> <span>imagine how we could</span> <span>better</span> <span>position the</span> <span>perspective</span> <span>of each of us </span><span>within</span> <span>the common frame of OpenCare.</span></span>\n\nIf I look at the \"local activities\" we have developed in Milan during the previous month I would start from these points:\n\n- What could be the added value of adopting a \u201cmaker/fablab\u201d approach to \u201creframe\u201d care systems pushing this kind of tools/skills/places into \u201ccommunity-driven\u201d care systems?\n\n- Which role can play the public actor?\n\n- Which are the favorable conditions (context, type of communities, types of problem/demand of care\u2026) in which this approach can be helpful and generative of innovation?\n\n- Other\u2026.\n\nIn my opinion, and adopting the perspective of Ezio Manzini (networks of care), the \u201cfablab concept/approach\u201d that we are following in the \u201cmilanese pilot\u201d (which intersects care; skills/education (learning by doing); sustainable development, and surely other things\u2026) could be one of the strategic assets within a broader ecosystem where more actors are included and play different roles (citizens as care recipients and care-givers, administrations, public health institutions and professionals, no profit organization and so on\u2026).\n\nFollowing this argument, the \u201cartefacts/services/devices\u201d that WeMake will prototype at the end of the co-design sessions are not the final result of the process. In my mind final results (to be evaluated) are related to the questions listed above.\n\n\u201cCommunities\u201d (and here I have in mind: something that is not \u201cfamilies\u201d, not individuals, but people linked by a common interest/purpose; so I would say \"elective comunities\") are the propulsive force and nodes of the ecosystem. People act together as they are moved by a common challenge (not \u201cneed\u201d if you don\u2019t like the term) which is not answered by traditional/closed systems.\n\nPlatforms (not only digital, but maybe also physical) could help to organize and improve the ecosystem (I\u2019ll come back to this point using the example of \u201cWelfare di tutti\u201d in Milan).\n\n\u00a0\n\nThanks to Ezio and to all of you for the challenging discussion!\n\n...and sorry for the amount of errors that you will find in this text.\n\nI'm going from one plane to another and I have no time for check :-)\n\nRossana\n\n", "created_at": "2016-06-22 16:58:16", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:11.482370", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 659, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28745, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1206, "post_number": 13, "raw": "<b>Go!</b>\n\nJay, you rock.\u00a0\n\nThe budget we do have is for unMonastery (starting February).

Many of us are working, often behind the scenes, to curate content, document location needs or keep track of registrants, so it just makes sense to back this up with high powered exposure to drive more participation and rise up to the challenge of hosting the coolest event Europe has seen. Seriously.\n\nSurely one person behind any Edgeryders official communication channel can\u2019t compete with a collective effort distributed across many countries! We need someone to gently herd a growing number of enthusiasts who are up for promoting LOTE in their own tribes, at a low cost (click &amp; share style). Tentatively, this would involve:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\tassemble a volunteer social media team: for team members this is an entry-level effort in Making LOTE</li>\n\n<li>\t\tdevise a strategy to drive engagement, registration to LOTE and traffic on edgeryders.eu platform</li>\n\n<li>\t\tcraft \"atoms of content\" from the LOTE/Edgeryders/unMonastery experience that are amenable to resharing by the team</li>\n\n<li>\t\tdeploy appropriately the official Edgeryders Facebook and Twitter presence (currently at 700 and &gt;1000 followers, respectively)</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nWhat\u2019s in it for you? For starters, you get to work with lovely Edgeryders, which is no small thing \u2018cause we\u2019re fun and easy maintenance. You also get free social media consultancy from your peers as part of a learning experience: that\u2019s a skill everybody needs nowadays, especially if you\u2019re jumpstarting your own project, with limited resources. We are happy to give you a <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/company/edgeryders\">Linkedin recommendation</a>. And lastly, you\u2019ll be a core part of an awesome event bringing together change makers from around the globe.

Just wrote a text that I lost due to bad connection+ typing directly in the platform. Will mention the main points and will elaborate if needed tomorrow.\n\n1. Yes, ENA is owned by a Russian company but its manager could as well be Armenian so our protest is not anti-Russian in any way. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/25/armenia-yerevan-protests-kremlin-ukraine?CMP=share_btn_fb\">Here's a good read</a>. It's the Armenian government that failed to manage it properly and is in debt now and tries to get the money from people which is not fair. We demand transparency, investigation and punishment of the ones who are responsible for this. Some 200. 000 Euros are missing and this money did not just evaporate.\u00a0\n\n2. Indeed, there are lots of provocateurs \u00a0hidden in the crowd and we expect them to act accordingly so as to trigger the reaction of the police and start a conflict. Lots of undercover police among us. The president just got back from Brussels, let's see what he has to say tomorrow.\n\n3. Electricity rates have risen already 3 times in the past 4 years! We used to pay 20AMD and we pay 40AMD now which is the double of what we paid a couple of years ago and if they apply the new rates we will pay 17% more, i.e. 48 AMD.\u00a0\n\nConsider the salary in Armenia(an average of 250 USD) and what we pay for electricity in a month in winter(120$) and the increase of some 40-50 USD would be totally unaffordable for the majority. Please, note there are the pensioners receiving only 70$ per month and many other disadvantaged classes who would need to starve to have lights and warm their houses.

Here, people can find at a short distance Chinese takaways, Italian pizzerias, Japanese all-you-can-eats and Indian restaurants (just to name a few).\n\nUnfortunately, the wide geographical network does not convert into effective connections.\n\nThat\u2019s why we asked ourselves:\n\nHow may we foster cultural exchange and engagement among different nationalities?\n\n<strong>FACT 2: Bovisa is undefined.</strong>\n\nIn the past, it was an industrial powerhouse. Today it\u2019s something different, difficult to define.\n\nIt lacks the identity that other areas have successfully established,\u00a0\n\nwhich also reflects on the feelings that people share towards their place.\n\nFor that reason, we believe that Bovisa needs to state new, authentic values\u00a0\n\nto make its way to the minds and hearts of people.\n\nThat\u2019s why we asked ourselves:\n\nHow may we shape a relevant and unifying image for this area?\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/663a0acb8980006a37c73d111e4861deef1d50f8.jpeg\" width=\"667\" height=\"499\">\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>Day 2</strong>\n\nDEFINING AN IDENTITY THROUGH CO-DESIGN\n\nMost social innovation projects start from the bottom-up, engaging communities by leveraging common interests.

I\u2019m really happy to have found this cool and engaged community of change-makers.\n\nI'm a interdisciplinary artist and independent researcher. Essentially self-taught, I've initialized the <a href=\"http://www.ampliativeart.org\">Ampliative Art</a> procedure. As filmmaker, I've made \u201c<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/69195707\">Vestiges</a>\u201d, an essay-film presented in various international film festivals and co-produced by the renowned avant-garde filmmaker Pere Portabella (I will be really glad to share with you my film if you want). I have also collaborated in the last film of Pere Portabella, which will be released soon and which I encourage everyone to see as it is a film on the current socio-political proposals of change in Spain (I will notice you).\n\nOn Ampliative Art project, my work consists of contribute to create new dynamics of social autonomy and try to offset systemic inequalities by making possible different socio-political conditions through art. For this question, I have had some problems to getting started the project. I\u2019ve tried it through different ways, including through a crowd-building web platform called Assembly.com (now modified and lost) where I learnt a lot from all those collaborators who joint to the project. Here I was project manager and product designer of two projects, an art web platform and an app for gifs. The issue on that attempt was that the collaborators where focused on the revenues and progressively changed the project to do a marketplace, which was the opposite of the open art and culture principles I believe.\n\nSo my work on Ampliative could be the following:\n\n- Motivator, full time\n\n- Facilitator, full time, I\u2019m here to do my best and help in whatever I know\n\n- Design, I can design the user-flow and all sites, but I don\u2019t know to code. To see an example you can check out www.ampliativeart.org/en/example but take note I want to make a more discrete and soft design for respect more the art works inside.\n\n- And I will also look for more people who wants to enjoy with us!\n\nAt this time I\u2019m the only person involved in the project, but, being that its manifesto was published recently, it has received signatures and acceptation of really interesting and awesome people :)\n\nAs you see, my English is a bit poor, but I hope to learn more with you. I should say I don\u2019t feel comfortable in Skype calls, but I will do my best if required.\n\nYou can write me to ampliativeart@gmail.com or ask me whatever you want here.\n\nAh! and would love to be in any Unmonastery \u201cretire\u201d!\n\n<a href=\"http://www.ampliativeart.org\">\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/907fb05d82107e4e302dd3df7674866d9dc21faa.gif\" width=\"360\" height=\"300\"><br></a>\n\n", "created_at": "2015-11-03 11:20:59", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:28.193637", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 511, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10256, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 4458, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>confirmed?</b>\n\nAre these dates final (confirmed) dates?\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-26 11:09:53", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:59.153895", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 12, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13296, "user_id": 1457, "topic_id": 3429, "post_number": 7, "raw": "No problem, easy to correct the dates and the text!\n\nPing @alberto, \u00a0would like to ear you too.\n\nwhich option\n\nwhat info should we put on the poster\n\nany other comments?\n\n", "created_at": "2014-09-18 08:43:42", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:15.221998", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 39, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [12185], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19615, "user_id": 2330, "topic_id": 5132, "post_number": 12, "raw": "<b>Need to make an estimation</b>\n\nBy this week community call - Wednesday 13th.

Feel free to comment, I would like to start designing this Wednesday, Thursday.\n\n<strong>Title: So what do you know about \"The Sugar\" ?</strong>\n\nIntro: The number of people wih diabetes has doubled in the last decennia.\u00a0Everybody knows someone that is suffering from\u00a0diabetis but do you know what is really happening inside the body of someone with diabetes? Do you know what to do when someone gets a hypo?\u00a0In this infographic you will find some basic info about diabetes and how you can prevent it.\u00a0\n\n<strong>1) What is diabetes?</strong>\n\nDiabetes is a chronic condition that increases blood sugar levels. This can have two causes: either the insulin is insufficient or the insulin produced is insufficiently effective. In both cases, the cells can not absorb enough sugar (glucose), which accumulates in the blood. There are two types of diabetis:\n\nType 1: Occurs\u00a0usually in children or adolescents and affects less than 10% of all people with diabetes.\u00a0Body does not produce enough insulin.\n\nType 2: Over 90% of people with diabetes have diabetes type 2. This occurs especially from the age of 40 years.\u00a0Body produces insulin but can\u2019t use it well.\n\n<strong>2) How many people have diabetes?\u00a0</strong>\n\nThe number of people with diabetes has risen from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014.\u00a0In 2012, an estimated 1.5 million deaths were directly caused by diabetes and another 2.2 million deaths were attributable to high blood glucose. WHO projects that diabetes will be the 7th leading cause of death in 2030.\n\n<strong>3) What are the complications? How can you prevent them?</strong>\n\nDiabetes can lead to complications in many parts of the body and increase the risk of dying prematurely.\u00a0\n\nIntestines &amp; stomach problems, heart attack, kiney failure, blindness, hearing loss, stroke, damage of nerves and blood vessels, amputation of feet or leg, fatigue,..\n\nEat and drink healthy, quit smoking, keep your weight under control, exercise, keep the sugar levels in your blood under control, check your feet, get a check-up on a regular basis, keep learning about diabetes!\n\n<strong>4) What is\u00a0gestational diabetes?</strong>\n\nA special form of diabetes is gestational diabetes. This occurs especially in the second half of pregnancy. This calls for further follow-up to minimize risks during pregnancy and at birth. Usually the diabetes disappears after childbirth. The diagnosis of gestational diabetes is an alarm signal. It means that you have a high risk of developing persistent diabetes in the first 5 to 10 years. Pregnancy diabetes occurs in 5 to 20% of pregnancies, usually in the second half of pregnancy.\n\n<strong>5) What do you need to do when someone has an attack?</strong>\n\nIf your blood sugar levels fall below 4 mmol / l, you have a hypo.

For example, six to eight tablets of grape sugar.\n\nIf your blood sugar exceeds 10 mmol / l, you have hyper.

It seems humans have always adjusted their activity within economic systems in attempt to evade regulations, by not paying taxes, not being monitored by any government and therefore not being included in the gross national product (GNP). The global informal economy accounts for:\n\n- $10 trillion = second biggest GDP in the world,\n\n- in emerging markets, it employs up to 80% of the workforce,\n\n- and is the fasted growing economy in developed and emerging markets.\n\nIn the early 1970's, money promptly became ungovernable due to neoliberalism and the privatization of public interest, resulting in the creation of multinationals corporations that introduced complexity in the system. As anthropologic economist Keith Hart supports, informality is a product between bureaucracy and people. Political policies and global money face an evermore worldwide labyrinthine challenge, probably why experienced Keith Hart advocates, \"regulation is a joke now!\".\n\nLearning from complex adaptive systems, dialectics of forms between de-localized and re-localized contexts, ecosystemic models based on incentives and organization, living in extremely fast environments generally outpacing humans, is not a smooth task. Experts claim it is crucial to converge efforts in recognizing social forms or patterns inside the organized chaos. To some extent a Gestaltist approach, allowing the breakup of elements from the whole situation into what it really is, finding the variables in the invariable.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe informal economy often takes place inside a flexible trusted network in which flexibility comes from negotiating the limits of mutual trust. Other primary variables are time and money, as Niti Bhan eloquently adds, \"the only certainty is uncertainty\". Thus, unlike industrialized contexts of long-term planning, emerging informal markets often rely on short-term risky investments for survival. However sustainability, simplicity and collaboration are key assets of informality while complex systems have no space specific rooted local norms.\n\nOn another note, we should benefit from the world's \"meta-instability\" to renew ourselves. According to Scott Smith, demographics are the main drivers to go \"from growth, to functional innovation towards resilience\". Maybe corporations can face disruptions by setting the stage, creating minimum infrastructure and letting society participate and build upon. Besides, there is great importance in the \u201cmaking\u201d, according to Richard Tyson, \u201cit is not about solving complex problems but negotiating with present environments\u201d. Indeed organizations made possible prosperity, we shouldn't turn our backs on them, instead we should look for the right environments in which shifting from an informal economy to a human economy is achievable. Quoting John Thackara, \u201cfrom control to stewardship\u201d.\n\nStudies show that many of the bottom of the pyramid (BoP) are on top when it comes to happiness index despite consuming 20 times less resources than industrialized countries. Knowing the emerging countries represent 80% of the globe's population, who has to learn from who in order to change?\n\n<span>Thank you for reading!</span>\n\nTiago\n\n", "created_at": "2012-10-18 15:51:05", "updated_at": "2017-10-04 10:48:54.628019", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 549, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 15.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21250, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2928, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>The Artefact Fallacy</b>\n\nGuys, let me say this bluntly: you run the risk of crashing into what I have decided to call the Artefact Fallacy.\u00a0\n\nIt works like this:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>All social systems have a \"human\" part (tacit knowledge, orientation, values of the people manning them) and a technology part (you seem to be very clear on this, no need for me to delve on it). \u00a0In<em> online</em> social systems the two parts are particularly easy to distinguish.\u00a0A fancy and formally precise way of saying this is that they exist in agent-artefact space.</li>\n\n<li>They need to be designed (or evolved, if you, like me, take a complex systems perspective) very interdependently from each other.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nAlmost no one disagrees with the above. But in practice almost everyone ends up focusing on the technology part and ignoring the social part, hence falling prey to the Artefact Fallacy. The result is fundamentally crippled systems, that can't help living in agent-artefact space but, having been designed as \"empty\" technologies with some idealized user \u00a0in mind, don't work. Hence: lots of empty platforms.\n\nAt the risk of bringing back painful memories, the unMonastery founders ran into the Artefact Fallacy once already (I write this for <a href=\"/u/nathanairplane\">@nathanairplane</a>\u00a0who did not participate in that discussion). unMonasterians elected to build their own tech stack over using this platform, mostly on user experience considerations. I pointed out that a larger and more vibrant community with worse (but improvable) software was likely a better situation than fragmented subcommunities on better (largely NOT improvable) software. We ended up having <a href=\"/t/build-your-own-home-why-the-user-experience-on-the-edgeryders-website-is-worse-than-on-the-commercial-cloud-and-why-thats-good/2404\">a passionate conversation</a> with sleepless nights (in the comments) \u2013 which, of course, solved nothing.\n\nThis was OK, though. There was no need to solve anything, because in due time the problem solved itself. The Edgeryders platform got better. The unMonastery website, as I write this, seems not to be updated all that often: maintaining tech, even at the level of updating the content, is hard. The last news on the unMon website dates April 4th, 42 days ago; meanwhile, Edgeryders collected on average 20 comments <em>a day</em>. This platform, for all its shortcomings, has emerged as an essential way for unMonasterians in Matera can stay close to the Edgeryders community, recruit new people, build alliances. This is not because of anything magic in Drupal Commons, but because this particular instance of Drupal Commons as customized by <a href=\"/u/matthias\">@Matthias</a>\u00a0and all of us lives in symbiosis with enough smart and dedicated people to make it worth it to hang on to.\n\nThe Artefact Fallacy does not kill the unMonastery-in-a-box project, but it does constrain it. For example, moving from Drupal to BuddyPress (very similar functionalities, if memory serves) would be a spectacularly bad idea from a social standpoint. Taking the Artefact Fallacy seriously means that it makes way more sense to replicate on Edgeryders whatever it is that people like about BuddyPress, so that the community can be kept together and disrupted as little as possible. And taking it\u00a0<em>really</em>\u00a0seriously means that even introducing new functionalities should only happen after making sure that there is a dedicated group of early adopters.\u00a0\n\n",

esistenza.\n\nI giovani, fulcro di una sana societ\u00e0 democratica, scevra da qualsiasi infiltrazione cancerogena, hanno bisogno di contribuire alla costruzione di un\u2019Europa moderna e indipendente, e credo che non si possa realizzare al di fuori di soggetti organizzati, come ad esempio i partiti.\n\nLa politica pulita \u00e8 l\u2019unica via maestra per contribuire e realizzare una societ\u00e0 che valorizzi ogni individuo con le proprie specificit\u00e0, rendendolo parte integrante, e rafforzare quel senso di unione collettivo che da molto tempo \u00e8 trascurato.\n\nLa forza

basta delegare agli altri.\n\nBisogna incalzare e trasformare i partiti, per una reale rivoluzione democratica, i giovani, rispettosi delle istituzioni, e all\u2019interno di organizzazioni regolamentate, devono progettare e diventare attori di una nuova societ\u00e0 solidale.\n\nParlando di Europa Unita, ormai \u00e8 noto a tutti, non basta avere una moneta unica, \u00e8 indispensabile mettere un serio freno alle banche, alle hobby economiche, che si faccia un\u2019attenta ed equa gestione delle risorse.\n\nAgire in prima persona significa mettersi in discussione, questa \u00e8 stata la molla che mi stimola continuamente, il confronto si deve considerare un\u2019opportunit\u00e0 di crescita. I partiti non devono, in nessun modo, delegare il proprio ruolo, sperando di ottenere forse qualche consenso in pi\u00f9, l\u2019assunzione di responsabilit\u00e0 deve essere piena e partecipata, diversamente sarebbe il fallimento.\n\nVoglio affermare un ultimo concetto, soffermandomi sull\u2019importanza del ruolo della \u201cconoscenza\u201d, della \u201ccultura\u201d tutto ruota intorno alle proprie e le altrui capacit\u00e0 culturali.

There was a great consensus among the audience on the strong support and commitment offered by the political leadership in the country to the values\u00a0embedded\u00a0within the open government initiatives such as transparency,\u00a0citizen\u00a0<wbr>participation and government accountability. The country's top national agenda as identified in the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.uaepm.ae/en/index.html\" style=\"color: rgb(204, 102, 0); line-height: 1.5; \" target=\"_blank\">UAE Vision 2021 and UAE Government Strategy (2011-2013)</a>\u00a0clearly calls for such practices. \u00a0You can follow the\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/HHShkMohd\" style=\"color: rgb(204, 102, 0); line-height: 1.5; \" target=\"_blank\">Twitter\u00a0</a>and\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/HHSheikhMohammed\" style=\"color: rgb(204, 102, 0); line-height: 1.5; \" target=\"_blank\">Facebook\u00a0</a>accou<wbr>nts of\u00a0His Highness Sheikh Mohammad Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai to see how he himself provides \u00a0practical examples in this matter.</wbr></wbr>\n\nIn addition, many federal and local government entities across the country have already started adopting the open\u00a0government\u00a0practices such as publishing open government data and engaging citizens in designing\u00a0government\u00a0policies and services. Only a few days ago, the\u00a0Federal Authority for Nuclear Regulation (FANR)\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.fanr.gov.ae/en/mediacentre/news/pages/uae-regulator-invites-public-comments-on-nuclear-power-plant-guide.aspx\" style=\"color: rgb(204, 102, 0); line-height: 1.5; \" target=\"_blank\">published\u00a0The draft<span>\u00a0</span>Guidelines for the Design, Construction and Operation of Nuclear Power Plants</a>\u00a0for \u00a0public consultation. Several government entities have started sharing good amount of their data in open format on their websites, this includes the national portal of the UAE (<a href=\"http://government.ae/web/guest/uae-data\" style=\"color: rgb(204, 102, 0); line-height: 1.5; \" target=\"_blank\">government.ae</a>).\n\nOn the other side,\u00a0the attendees discussed the noticeable changes that are taking place in the UAE society (comprising citizens and expatriate residents) when it comes to\u00a0the perception of government's responsibilities\u00a0towards them and how it should fulfill these\u00a0responsibilities. Most of the audience see a shift towards a more proactive and interactive culture where citizens take actions to engage with government authorities and participate in designing its policies and programs. Social media is\u00a0believed\u00a0to be \u00a0an enabling tool used by the public in smart and effective way to promote this shift. In my presentation I showed the case study of \\#CleanJumeirah initiative, you can read about it in my\u00a0<a href=\"http://ibadawi.com/?p=388&amp;lang=ar\" style=\"color: rgb(204, 102, 0); line-height: 1.5; \" target=\"_blank\">earlier post</a>\u00a0(in Arabic).\n\nSo all these are enabling success factors for the open government data in UAE to flourish and grow horizontally and vertically. But we shouldn't overlook the challenges and risks that might hinder the progress of the initiative. Key challenges identified by the audience include the need for delivering this message to decision makers and policy designers across government entities, lack of enough awareness and education on the topic \u00a0on various levels including business and technical levels, some legislation barriers \u00a0and the culture of government entities that\u00a0considers\u00a0information as classified assets by nature even if they aren't. Other less-concerning challenges include practical and technical issues related to data exchange across government information systems and the design of open data portals.\n\nThe audience have suggested and discussed several valuable approaches to tackle these challenges. However, in my humble\u00a0opinion I see building up a community of possible open data stakeholders across UAE as a crucial success factor.

The initial crew of unMonasterians that slid through the recruitment process and landed pounding at the gates, were a super selection of adult human beings.  With small variations in individual strong points, we proved willing and able to exhibit understanding and patience in the face of several frustrating factors. Not only was not every last detail in place for the theoretical Feb.1st moving-in-day, but several key systems exhibited signs of cantankerousness within days of the upstart. Faced with this quirky beginning, our crowd showed themselves to be generous, creative and not the least, flexible. Our working principle was soon articulated as \u2018We Trust in the Process\u2019.  It was clearly preordained that as an unmonastic order \u2018unaided by precedence\u2019 we would be fated to 'compose tradition' as it became necessary. However to serenely surrender to the prototype variant of our Vow of Poverty has prompted some heroic effort. In his characteristically flowery opening speech at the inaugural press conference, our belov\u00e9d committee chairperson Paolo Verri seemingly waxed on a bit about giving us life-stimulating \u2018difficulties\u2019. Some of us may have hoped that these collective difficulties had been a little less thorough, but it is through living the \u2018interesting times\u2019 of our first days that we as novices have built the foundation of our unSister/unBrotherhood. The inevitable structural disappointments may have been tailor-made for fertilising our prototype. They have demanded that we begin at a conceptual zero; abandoning our dreams and building upon reality as it has presented itself. This embracing of on-the-ground reality is a central key to good project design. It requires a willingness to leave behind the rhetoric of the project proposal and build one\u2019s work in situ -- one human contact at a time.   To help stir up a ground-swell of enthusiasm just prior to the March 2013 Meet the Community gathering at the Mediateca to chart out the main concerns of local citizens that might be appropriate for the unMonastery to address, I stepped forward for an online interview with Carlo who posed a typically gracious and diplomatic Matera-style question. Accounting for several generations of translation and the vagaries of my memory it popped out something like: \u201cHow should the Materiani prepare for your arrival?\u201d -- I tried to summons my line as a realist. I requested that above all that they try not to be perfect. We were coming to make mistakes and to learn from them. It would suffice that they were customary fallible human beings much like those whom we find in our home countries. As I recall, I even suggested that those among them with bureaucratic tendencies be allowed to exercise them... Our unVow of Poverty has several unavoidable structural components. The absence of personal space has shown that different people have different levels of adaptability. Sleep deprivation has long factored in the mandatory ecstasy of monks and nuns. Rising for \u2018early morning\u2019 prayers was a way to put the adaptive skills of both novice and initiate to trial. The Saga of the Snorers is worth an illuminated manuscript by itself. The total effect of the dormitory experience designed to resurrect fallen urbanites and to rewire any residue of a decadent lifestyle -- seemed to work; although it has been noted that some centuries of similar experiments led the Benedictines to adopt the more satisfactory recipe of each monk to his individual cell.   It seems that within the initial constellation of unMonasterians a collective sleeping arrangement successfully established itself in the Western sleeping hall. However, the rest of the anticipated floor plan has yet to be realised. Not accustomed to fungal incursions, we have been left to mediating upon the expanding splotches of off-colour wall growth as if they were a fearful Shroud of Turin. It has been implied that this is a harmless blessing of the Sassi, but that no information on either the high-tech (silica gel) or low-tech (vinegar) solutions employed by our neighbours was included in our guidebook has awoken creeping concern - when our core exercise of \u2018Listening to the Stones\u2019 becomes breathing in the lichen, the not yet acclimatised Northern Europeans may ask can this be healthy to share ones life with such mould? Currently only one of our kind dares brave this environment, although perhaps this is a self-imposed penance spurred by serious snoring infractions...  The Year of Flexibility  Although the premise of the unMonastery has long been based upon a three-year cycle, the clever ploy of a 4-month condensed prototype has brought a valued extra pressure. As was always the case in the generic three-year unMonastery model, the \u2018in-house\u2019 activity would constitute a large proportion of our Landing Year. The 4-month compacted version of the Matera Prototype has always invited to the inevitable frustration of compromise. Our perhaps protracted initial adaptive phase may appear from the outside as excessively introverted, but is in fact an essential gestation period during which we explore fault lines and distill leadership.    Have we ridden dangerously into the forest of burnout? Yes, indeed. It remains to be seen if we have the balancing skills to negotiate ourselves beyond the feeling that we are stuck in the establishment phase. However there are strong indicator that this should be possible...   The Daily Liturgy  UnMonasterian Cristiano Siri has contributed greatly to our mental well being by providing a solid fundament with several small daily ritual elements culled from his work with The Art of Hosting. These provide a secure window of opportunity to allow everyone a chance to personally get up-to-date with how the process may be wearing upon them. Each morning, after both our morning practice sessions on the terrace overlooking the best view in the city and after our cross-cultural breakfast, we religiously meet in a circle of at least two orbits. The second orbit is the predicable planning circle of what each person is currently engaged with and their plans and commitments for the coming day. The first circle is more subjective: How are we feeling? People may be hopeful and energetic, or sleepy and discouraged; there is room for us all. A version of this question is repeated just before bedtime.   Together these two ritual daily meetings provide an agency for keeping each other visible. The inevitable psychic strain of so radically altering one\u2019s life patterns and subjecting oneself to a collective rhythm and reasoning requires compassion and listening. Pain in the Language  A second factor in our newly acquired poverty involved abandoning all our wordly possessions. For many of us this has included our greatest treasure - our verbosity. Embracing \u2018virulent linguistic helplessness\u2019 has been an additional challenge for the far afield. Not all of the unMonks have previously digested the experience of second language acquisition in their adult condition. Facing the surrender of a hard fought for functional lingua franca only to begin again at the primitive phrase book phase can also easily provoke an allergic reaction. An additional cost of this chronic infantile condition was too much reliance on bilingual local speakers as functional interface. This inevitably stretched this resource too finely.   Conventional and unconventional attempts to speed the acquisition of Italian have been integrated into our daily liturgy, but again we are squeezed by the condensed time factor. It is bad pedagogy to jump into premature language use before one is acquainted with the basics. In the three year model : year two and then year three would involve considerably more cross-fertilisation. The frustration level is currently being addressed to the degree that individuals have the imaginative resources, but it is only time that will relieve the more acute symptoms.  \ufffc  It is written somewhere in the Lore of the unMonastery that the Kitchen shall be the Queen of the House. This was most clearly voiced in preparatory discussions between Rita Pacheo and Antonio Elettrico. In the face of subjectively perceived poverty, solace would inevitably be sought in the creative act of creating and sharing meals. The sensuous quality of fresh local produce has brought us great satisfaction. For one habitually living further up the food chain, and therefore being routinely fed by agro-bizniz, it has been a liberation to share my greens with an occasional snail. That some of the late winter local vegetables don\u2019t immediately awaken the warmth of familiarity, can also challenge the taste buds and digestive juices; sometimes our cooking committees can be accused of substituting quantity for quality. However, early on in the group process we elected to outlaw the natural human psychic ventilation system of the complaint [ Note: the above statements are pure fact; the author is not indulging in hidden complaining.]  At the same time, others of our crew have been subject to the most cruel \u2018Tyranny of the Oppressed Minority\u2019; accepting imposed levels of vegetarianism that go unnoticed by the adherents, but that push the digestive tracts of others into virulent rebellion. Surrounded by old-fashioned shops offering short-journeyed meat, and magnificent fish counters laden with enticing often unknown species, this easily amounts to culinary torture.   The delicate balance of the Healing power of Mealtimes is dependent upon several factors. We feel that we have secured a satisfactory source of quality raw materials. We have a healthy competition to create works of art in a room that was long unheated and upon a brand new obsolete technology of the first generation of induction stove. That we are still under equipped with basic tools like soup spoons and chopping knives that chop and that would make life a touch more civilised, should soon rectified. What is harder to see the solution for, is the projected life of the kitchen as a functioning unit for more than two cooks and more than ten eaters. The need to model this our primary source of harmony upon large scale cooperative kitchen operations was spoken about on the ER platform prior to the LOTE and, as the meeting that commissioned this emotional health report clearly indicated, it remains the one place of recurrent frustration -- the unMonastarians are willing to use their outreach project budgets to rectify matters, but feel that hidden criteria for what is an acceptable solution that pit beauty against functionality are being employed. That this has dragged out into our second month of residency and until our second wave of unMonasterians has cost us much valuable time and psychic resources. On another level the ceremonial surrender of our worldly goods for the greater enrichment of the unMo has not yet occurred. Many Materan bistros accept our credit cards without question, some of us can still inadvertently employ the possessive pronoun \u2018mine\u2019 about the laptops that accompanied us into the house. Perhaps we have been too generous to one another (and ourselves) by restricting the push into our discomfort zone? Contemplating a harsher climate might induce greater degrees of ecstasy and revelation, but in the service of our perpetual prototype we tend to keep our ears tuned to what the inner community can safely tolerate. At our harshest we have debated restricting our connectivity - but the organic enforced periods of internet shut-down have already proven so traumatic that the resident unMonasterians practically resorted to non-stop analog discussion with one another. Internally we refer to this our time surviving an enforced Vow of Internet Silence as the five days of \u2018sucomunicatto\u2019 = excommunication.  One valuable tool developed by the early unMonks has been the dramatic use of inflated language. We often employ unNormal degrees of politeness and concern. When one of our number was inadvertently forced into exile for a period of days, the welcoming committee who welcomed him back into the fold at the bus station was quickly dubbed the \u201crescue mission\u201d. Are we reduced to psychic wrecks a mere three weeks after our first nights in our traditional home? Signs of strain are apparent, renewal is still possible. The characteristic unMo stress response has been to work harder: \u201cIl nostro duro lavoro sar\u00e1 tanto leggendario quanto i nostri baccanali.\u201d With the pivotal resource of the Queen of the House hopefully soon in place, we exhibit all signs of acclimatising with considerable success until at least the next wave of initiates makes their appearance...   \n\n", "created_at": "2014-03-07 17:52:00", "updated_at": "2017-10-02 14:47:19.018917", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2065, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27456, "user_id": 162, "topic_id": 1279, "post_number": 18, "raw": "Nice.

My life has been and continues to be full of journeys of all types, and every time I wake up, I am just as glad to see whatever weather and challenges the day will bring, as I am to see if I can get online (or not...).\n\nFor me, life is interconnected. Online and analog; sand, compost-soil-building and xeriscaping; humans and the multi-million other species also called \"earthlings;\" crisis-management, sustainability, and humanitarian projects; energy, the arts, memory and the future. I think the \"Golden Rule\" is a good thing; I wonder, if Archimedes had known about the relative powers of electricity, if he would have used a rod and fulcrum, or waves and a source-point?\n\nEnglish is my first language, the one I can usually spell properly. I have learned, of necessity, to communicate in various other languages, but do not claim to spell properly, nor always to use the most appropriate phrases. For me, language is like cuisine-- every nation, region, town, community, family has their own special ingredients to flavor their daily fare. Asian cinnamon is somewhat different from south American cannelle; the spice can be used in entrees, drinks and desserts, in dishes savory and sweet, or to preserve, scent, or color. The shades of flavor, scent, of words and intent, vary by culture, by access, by necessity.\n\nAnd this potpourri of ingredients, the colors, sounds, scents, flavors, the memories certain incidents or articles evoke, make up the life I live, the lives we share-- here, in Edgeryders, here, online, here, on Earth. People have many pasts, many needs, many dreams for their futures. Our evolutionary paths have enabled us to visualize change, verbalize desires, achieve goals far beyond the capabilities of many of our fellow \"earthlings.\"\u00a0\n\nWith capabilities and action come agency and culpability; with choice and access comes responsibility; with life-- knowlege that we have a past, must live through our present, and... expect, hope, dream for a future. People, indeed, all creatures with socially-organized instincts, seem to crave play, as well as survival-- of all species, we humans have found myriad ways to play, share, build, dream-- and as many or more to dis-include, denigrate and destroy. Even our games utilize destruction, and our arts and music, our myths, our media-- illustrate the depths of the human experience, as well as celebrate the heights.\n\n\"Lest we forget\" and wreak such destruction against ourselves in reality that life becomes unsustainable, imperiled, extinct-- my \"ryde\" combines all that I can learn and do, to try to understand, bring peace, to reach, bring equity, to act, and bring... as full a life as I can, for myself and for those whom I meet on my journey. The flavors of a life-- dependent, interdependent, independent-- learned from local and global custom, leavened with individual creativity; the sun shines on us all, no matter how or where we spend our days.\n\nSo I try to remember my journey is both my own, and shared, in ripples near and, perhaps far. In the immediate-- I hope my children are enjoying this part of their own life-travels, as they share their time with me. And I hope I can teach them an appreciation of life, what it is, what it can be, what it might be.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2011-10-18 21:43:05", "updated_at": "2017-09-21 13:50:29.863143", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 583, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 15.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3027, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 2994, "post_number": 1, "raw": "We are building \\#futurespotters event <a href=\"/t/futurespotters-workshops-the-aftermath/567\">here</a>.

I had heard other people had used the space and so asked landlady if there was space- she charged 200 pounds for a week and 4 us did a show there. A few of us thought it would be great as studios, and so approached landlady.\u00a0 Lots of people got involved, around 15 of us. At the time we were living in a house\u00a0 with a lot of us, so that was good that we could work a lot together. It was always a little bit tricky because she was a private landlord, and she was not sure what to do, there where no facilities to use for studios\u2014it was extremely cold, only one sink\u20144 floors in total that we could use. Retrospectively thinking about it was a gradual turning from studios into this space. Everyone had different layers of involvement. What was nice and flexible was that we were all able to leave at certain moments. It was definitely a considered move to create a new space within Glasgow, a space that did not exist, and a way for thinking together around what those kind of spaces would be, and what an artist run space would be in the community, particularly where we were placed. I was living in the East End which is like where I grew up in Dumbarton both of those areas are in the 0-20% most deprived areas on the SIMD (Scottish Index of Multiple Depravation). There became an interest within the community for us to be there. Over the years got more I got involved in that. What became interesting is looking back on all those issues around stewardship that is a key term for it, which I had not really thought about before. I guess I thought about it more as volunteering and public services and who is responsible for those kind of things. The building now is going ahead with big changes where they can have improved facilities, running a program with residencies, exhibitions and events. Still have a floor of studios with capacity of 12-15 and a committee of 5 running it and will probably have some external board members coming in, to help during that process.\n\nI definitely had the experience of talking to people finding out that they thought it was important for us to be there as an alternative to traditional education. For young people in the community to be exposed to artists and architects working in their neighborhood as a way of seeing that that kind of work as possible, as an option.\n\nThere was a large group of people, then it went down, and then it went back up within the committee. Looking back it was not egalitarian enough. I definitely drove a lot of the developing it into a space and having a business plan. There were only a few of us involved at a certain point and there was a moment of do we just leave or do we keep going. I think it became difficult to distinguish growth for growth sake or that it was definitely a good idea to do that, to open up. You just keep it in a small community. In the state that it was in, it was always going to be for a special interest group. The drive to improve the facility came from the drive to create a space for public use. We had different ideas within the committee. You have to be on same page for it to work, I started by doing classes in the community center, because our facilities where not adequate, and they were looking for activities. That was successful. Artist organizations are normally for a special interest group, the majority being art graduates.\u00a0 Having seen history of galleries in the area, where learning departments get tacked on the side, I was interested in starting something where those things were intrinsic to one another, have a program that was not just exhibition, if you were having an exhibition to make an attempt to have the conversations to reflect the things that really matter to people. Kind of mixing up who is the producer and who is the audience and who is the specialist and who was not. I don\u2019t believe in notions of talent. I think it is having a space where you can consider all kinds of productive labor and bringing those things to the table.\n\nFor me it was also tax payer money so that become important. Everyone gets into the role of becoming a gatekeeper, because there is only so much space, you get 300 people applying for a show, and it becomes more difficult for people to share their work. There is a huge culture of finding a place to show work, we were adding to that an option for the community and a space for artist studios for only 50 quid. I was interested in serving the community group and thinking horizontally about that, the arts community is served well. It was a private landlord as well, with a 25 year lease what happens after that? after all that public investment? It could literally go into private hands when lease is up\u2014so thinking long term are there better ways of working insuring that goes to public benefit- organizations have to be accountable. And also what is relevant to what is happening in their city and what is going to be happening in the world. Even thought you might build great things together there is a point where it becomes I think people come together, that is why should have funding for arts so people can do this kind of thing. It was easier than I thought, we got full funding within three years, for work in the area and we were allocated money to help with the building. It is possible but you have to give up working full time and get yourself a cheaper place to live. Living cheaply\u2014it is all these kind of informal economies that you have that make it possible to do these kinds of things. That would not be possible in the long term for some of us.\n\nThese issues really matter. It leads to lots of problems, and good stuff as well. There are definitely things you can do to help people along the way so that it does not lead to overworked, overwrought individuals, trying to look after themselves and trying to do decent stuff to make life a wee bit better in certain places. I noticed that in US- I am thinking about people I met doing great work. The difference there was, some people are well cared for and well looked after but it is questionable how much for the public good it is- it is a deep issue. A place in Greensboro (North Carolina)- it was for women specifically \u2013 has a group for people running non profit on low wages or no money along side rest of their lives, great place to discuss these things and receive advice and share common issues so you don\u2019t feel on a limb. It was not just for people working in the arts.\n\n<img alt=\"pipefact1\" class=\"psp-active\" height=\"440\" src=\"http://www.thepipefactory.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/pipefact1-1024x682.jpg\" width=\"472\"><img alt=\"image\" height=\"442\" id=\"irc_mi\" src=\"http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l243/garrymcc/Clay-Pipe-Factory-2.jpg\" style=\"margin-top: 3px;\" width=\"338\">\n\nThey should have allocated funds available \u2013 public servant are often paid to do these things, if there was something set aside for people, so they could put in for in grants and assistance in order to carry out this kind of work. And if the community has say in how services are run. This is where the community empowerment stuff comes in. If you hand more responsibility to the people working there, you don\u2019t have these strange systems where you have these people making decisions who are paid enormously, everyone in middle who is paid a living wage in the public sector and in your non profit sector which is low paid and always in these weird one or two year funding cycles and all the folk at the bottom who are dealing with all the mess and they are doing it for free, they are actually the ones using the services, so it does not really work. So if they pushed more readily available funds and resources that are available through an application process to be able to do that within your local community. In smaller communities and rural spaces and smaller towns, Scotland is not that big, if you have places where people can go to share knowledge and help one another, sound out ideas and problems. Extremely useful for people looking to do these things, some kind of support group and central point of information for these resources. And if possible more funds towards people on ground coming up with ideas and possible have ways to do it. Just need tiny bit of help to do it themselves. In wealthy city if there is a way for people to put in to a pot. Even if local patron thing, even if that is facilitated, it generally comes down to having development worker or central pool, or access to people in local government to help- streamlined funding not potlatched together. \u00a0\n\nI researched self-organization and public resources in arts, democratizing cultural programming within institutions and what could be useful for groups self-organizing and making recommendations in relation to that issue.\u00a0 This was in response to 2012 and David Cameron\u2019s Big Society, which was all about volunteerism and community doing things for self while making huge cuts-- austerity measures. I wanted to know what are the politics of DIY culture in Arts, what are the consideration for us doing this. Are we making less of a case for support of the arts and making a drive toward volunteer and private funding, or do we want to keep public investment in these kinds of things, and we make a case for state support.\u00a0 One organization in New Orleans- were providing arts education in schools, without it there would be none. That was one guy working three jobs- the people running these organizations, parents running day care in morning to make money, being on boards and applying for grants, non-stop you know. It was strange to see. I think the question came: it is the political economy of what you do. Relating that to how you look after your household, not just financially, and how that radiates out in to your streets, your city, your country and the world. What is the thread that runs through or are you acting in different ways in those spheres. Big society has dropped of the language of the conservatives- what consequence does that have for children, what is available to them in school and communities.\n\nThe community empowerment bill will make it easier for people to take over spaces that they would have no chances of previously. I have already seen that in my own council (in Aberdeen).\u00a0 People are much more aware. If people call up to say what is happening with that building they don\u2019t just get the phone put down on them, with the legislation that kind of conversation will have to be followed up on. That is exciting. It is just now more how to get people aware, to get literature out and support around that and conversations about what that can be. It is quite often elderly people that run the community centers; there is already a lot of knowledge around there. We have cultural assets map, but a lot of property is not on there and I am not sure how publicly available that it is.\u00a0 That will open up some doors.\n\nBeth is still formulating some of her thoughts around these issues and will be sending me her final report- which I will post in a few weeks.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-10-13 13:18:47", "updated_at": "2017-10-02 10:23:05.197266", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2216, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 105.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1784, "user_id": 21, "topic_id": 1751, "post_number": 1, "raw": "We want to provide the way to reach us, crossing the gardens of our city, heading towards the natural world wild, will achieve the culture of ' fire.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-10-11 13:21:47", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:08.914774", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 29, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32706, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1675, "post_number": 42, "raw": "<b>That's the spirit</b>\n\nHey Yatan, good to meet you!

Hattest du vorher schon mal Kontakt zu China?</strong>\n\nNein. Ich fand\u2018s gut \u2013 eigentlich. Meine Br\u00fcder fanden es richtig schei\u00dfe \u2013 haben geheult und hatten gar keine Lust. Ich war traurig mein Zuhause zu verlassen, aber habe es auch als M\u00f6glichkeit gesehen Neues zu erkunden, neue Sachen, neue Sprache, Kultur und so. Was kann ich noch sagen? Es gibt so vieles. Es war auf jeden Fall schwierig sich dort einzufinden, weil der Alltag und die Einstellung sehr anders waren als in Deutschland. Also insgesamt, wie die Leute gelebt haben. Kultur bedeutet ja nicht nur Tanz und Musik, das schl\u00e4gt sich ja \u00fcberall nieder: wie die H\u00e4user aussehen, wie das U-Bahnnetz aufgebaut ist, wie sich Leute begr\u00fc\u00dfen\u2026\n\n<strong>Hat man gemerkt, dass das Alter einen Unterschied macht? Deins und das Alter von deinem Vater, also wie man verschieden den Alltag wahrnimmt und sich integriert als Erwachsener und als Kind?</strong>\n\nDer gr\u00f6\u00dfte Unterschied bestand bei mir und meiner Mutter. Mein Vater hatte ja dort schon Kollegen/Freunde\u2026sein Alltag war nicht so anders. Meiner Mutter fiel es schwer Kontakte zu kn\u00fcpfen. Wir Kinder sind ja \u00fcber die Schule eingebunden worden. Aber die Erwachsenen mussten sich selbst zurecht finden. Es gab auch Support -Organisationen, aber das waren dann kurze Willkommens-Veranstaltungen und dann ging es nicht weiter. Zudem ist es f\u00fcr \u00e4ltere Menschen umso schwerer die Sprache zu lernen. Als Kind geht das noch leichter.\n\n<strong>Ich wei\u00df nicht, ob das jetzt zu pers\u00f6nlich ist\u2026aber was hat deine Mutter dort gemacht? Dein Vater hatte den Job und ihr Kinder die Schule, aber wie war das f\u00fcr deine Mutter?</strong>\n\nSie hatte keine Arbeit\u2026.jetzt speziell. Aber \u00fcber die Jahre hat sie sich selbst integriert in die Gesellschaft der Eltern, Nachbarschaft und Schule\u2026sie war z.B. im Elternbeirat. Und sie hat dann viele gemeinn\u00fctzige Projekte angefangen selber zu organisieren, selbst angefangen Willkommens-Treffen f\u00fcr neue Leute an der Schule zu organisieren, Wochenendausfl\u00fcge f\u00fcr Eltern und Kinder und eine Fu\u00dfball-Liga. Au\u00dferdem hat sie B\u00fccher geschrieben, so Guide-Books, die die wichtigsten Dinge erl\u00e4utern: \u00c4rzte, die Englisch sprechen; wo man Schuhe findet, die gro\u00df genug sind, weil die Asiaten ziemlich kleine F\u00fc\u00dfe haben, 38 findet man noch, aber mit 42 hat man kaum eine Chance, da muss man die Insider-Tipps kennen.\n\n<strong>Warst du auf einer normalen Schule?</strong>\n\nWir waren auf einer internationalen Schule, als experts und sehr abgeschirmt von den locals.\n\n<strong>Was war das f\u00fcr eine Erfahrung? Gut oder schlecht?</strong>\n\nBeides! Ich fand es immer schon einen krassen Unterschied zwischen der chinesischen Kultur und meiner eigenen. Irgendwie ist es schon auch schade, dass man nicht so viel interagiert hat mit Chinesen. Aber durch die Schule habe ich auch die Option bekommen ganz viele verschiedene Kulturen kennenzulernen, auch die chinesische. Man ist viel rumgereist und hat auch schon einiges angenommen. Man hat sich aber schon \u00a0auch als Fremder gef\u00fchlt und wurde auch als Fremder angesehen. Ich wei\u00df nicht ob das deine Frage so beantwortet\u2026\n\n<strong>Hast du denn dann China generell als Land empfunden, das offen f\u00fcr sowas ist? Oder eher als ein nicht so offenes Land f\u00fcr Fremde?</strong>\n\nMein Eindruck ist nochmal ein ganz anderer, als der meiner Mutter. Sie hat viel mit chinesischen Organisationen gearbeitet durch ihre Projekte. Ich hatte nie das Gef\u00fchl, das wir feindselig angeschaut wurden, aber es gab auch nicht nur Offenheit. China hat geschichtlich gesehen nicht nur die besten Erfahrungen mit Ausl\u00e4ndern gemacht: Im 20 Jahrhundert wurden sie von verschiedensten Kolonialm\u00e4chten ausgebeutet.\n\n<strong>Wie war es f\u00fcr dich dann nach Deutschland zur\u00fcck zu kommen?</strong>\n\nIch bin ja gar nicht direkt zur\u00fcck, sondern erstmal nach England. Aber es war eigentlich, als w\u00e4re ich nie weg gewesen, weil wir auch immer in den Ferien in Deutschland waren. Deutschland ist irgendwie immer mein Zuhause gewesen.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<em>Reflection - Care on the move\u00a0</em>\n\nGesundheit war ein Thema, bei dem der kulturelle Unterschied besonders offensichtlich wurde. Die Auffassung von Wohlbefinden hat sehr spirituelle und traditionelle Z\u00fcge in der chinesischen Medizin. Man h\u00f6rt von riesigen Schwarzmarktgesch\u00e4ften, die Haifischflossen und Teile anderer gef\u00e4hrdeter Tierarten f\u00fcr medizinische Zwecke anbieten. Auch andere \u201aalternative\u2018 Heilpraktiken wie Akupunktur, Massagen, Pflanzenheilkunde und bestimmte Bewegungsformen wie Qigong sind sehr beliebt. Es ist ein ganzheitliches Konzept von Gesundheit verbreitet; alles h\u00e4ngt miteinander zusammen, Balance ist ma\u00dfgebend. Die meisten Leute folgen Prinzipien der traditionellen Chinesischen Medizin, obwohl diese nicht auf wissenschaftlichen Fakten beruht und oft ineffektiv oder gar sch\u00e4dlich sein kann. Was hier manchmal als Aberglaube oder Hippiequatsch abgestempelt wird, wird dort weitgehend praktiziert. Weiter noch wird eher der westlichen Medizin und industriellen Pharmazie misstraut.\n\nAls Ausl\u00e4nder in China war es nicht immer einfach, die richtige Pflege zu bekommen. Kommunikation war die erste H\u00fcrde. Das Gesundheitssystem war ganz anders aufgebaut. Zudem musste man sich neu orientieren: man konnte nicht mehr einfach zu seinem altbekannten Hausarzt gehen, sondern musste erst mal neue Anlaufstellen finden. Es gab gewisse Kliniken und Zahn\u00e4rzte, die unter den Expats verbreitet waren, wo die meisten hingingen, weil dort Englisch gesprochen wurde oder man gar international \u00c4rzte hatte. Doch gr\u00f6\u00dfere Operationen lie\u00df man dann doch lieber in Deutschland machen oder holte sich zumindest eine zweite Meinung in Hongkong ein, dass durch seine britische Besetzung einen sehr starken westlichen Einfluss aufwies. Wieso diese Art Missvertrauen zu den chinesischen \u00c4rzten bestand, wei\u00df ich nicht. Lag es nur an der Angst, sich nicht richtig verst\u00e4ndigen zu k\u00f6nnen oder gab es generell kulturelle Unterschiede im Umgang mit Krankheit? Wie unterschiedlich war der Stand der Technik?\n\nWas ich wei\u00df ist, dass meine Mutter bestimmte Medikamente zum Beispiel nur in Deutschland kaufen konnte \u2013 auf der anderen Seite waren in China Pillen ohne Rezept zu erstehen, die in Deutschland gar nicht verkauft werden durften. Die Regulationen und Kontrollen waren generell anders. Zudem hat man erfahren, dass Chinesen aus H\u00f6flichkeit nicht gerne \u201anein\u2018 sagen, auch wenn sie wissen, dass sie etwas nicht k\u00f6nnen. Wenn man sich verl\u00e4uft, weil jeder, dem man nach dem Weg fragt, dich in irgendeine Richtung schickt, wenn er die richtige Antwort nicht wei\u00df, ist das nervig. ALs Arzt k\u00f6nnte so etwas jedoch sehr gef\u00e4hrlich sein.\u00a0Wie flie\u00dfen\u00a0solche Gewohnheiten in die\u00a0Pflege\u00a0ein? Wie kann man solche Verst\u00e4ndnisl\u00fccken identifizieren und \u00fcberbr\u00fccken?\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-04-12 18:43:12", "updated_at": "2018-05-26 05:21:11.719229", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1510, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 15.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20119, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1347, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Channel inertia?</b>\n\nThis may be my own \"everything is a network\" bias, but communities are people somehow connected. Can we agree on that? If so, then it is safe to state that they will learn to connect to each other in a certain way, and that there will be a certain reluctance to shift from that channel to another. So, I meet my friend Vincent at the climbing gym, and I phone my sister regularly. Of course I could phone Vincent too, but I don't, because, you know, he is the climbing gym guy. Interacting with him in the context of the climbing gym now comes naturally to me: we know that we will take turns in securing each other, that we will speak mostly English but occasionally French, that it is okay to shout suggestions to each other when we are up there. I could go on, but you see where this is going. It's like a river that digs its own bed; a dramatic event (an earthquake or a major flood) could alter the course of the river in principle, but it really takes something big for that to actually happen.\n\nSo, MC for Makers had a narrative of being a great meetup in Berlin. That's the context . Email, not so much. This is why, insofar as possible, I try to \"fold communities onto themselves\", to use the normal community channel to plan the next step, to collapse into the same space the planning and the execution. A great example of that is Wikipedia: log in and go to the community space. What are they writing the encyclopedia with? A software called Wikimedia. What are they using to coordinate, write guidelines, raise funds, organize parties? Wikimedia again. Easy.\n\nI guess this leads to what I am going to call Cottica's Conjecture:\n\n<em>Online communities are intrinsically more sustainable than offline ones other than at the small scale</em>\n\nBecause online coordination/communication is just orders of magnitude cheaper. :-)\n\n", "created_at": "2012-03-22 13:12:31", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:52.034663", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 346, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24203, "user_id": 1974, "topic_id": 3008, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>reflexions</b>\n\nThank you!

It's not just a question of considering the perspectives of the administration/decision-makers on one side, and the citizens on the other. You have to consider the perspectives of all possibly involved actors, to stablish the requirements.\n\nFor example: the perspectives of the media (local/alternative/civic media) with regards to civic engagement are different from the participants or the promoters. The same can be said for the \"facilitators\" of the processes. And actually, by definition... it is completely wrong to speak of a \"bottom-up\", because always there are a lot of \"bottom-ups\", different citizens and citizens groups with competing interests and views, that will have different desires with regard to any participatory decission.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo... we think that we need to move further from the dualism expressed in the \"top-down\"/\"bottom-up\" opposition, and go in the direction of a \"kaleidoscopic governance\", with multiple actors and stakeholders involved.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHaving said that, and comming back to your question: once you leave behind the dualist distintion between top/down... and start designing requirements from a \"governance perspective\" many of the requirements and tools needed to support participation... start to converge. It is not much a question on \"WHO\" is doing the things, but of \"WHAT\" they aim to achieve: actually, the utility that they want to extract from the participatory process.\n\nFor example: a municipality could be intereested in performing a \"deliverative poll\", or some kind of sociologically advance poll of the citizens of a neighborhood, to orient their policy making process. But... this can also be useful for an NGO: to ask in the same way to citizens to orient their actions and their demands to the executive. And it can be useful for a political party. Or to a social movement that is organising \"popular assemblies\" in the neighbourhoods.\n\nSo... yes. When you move from actors to intentions... you discover that very different actors can share some intentions. And thus... they can benefit from similar tools.\n\nRegards,\n\nPedro\n\nPS: We are planning to release soon in PeP-NET blog a conceptual tool we have created: the matrix of civic implication. This matrix helps to conceive Civic Engagement as something that grows much richer and powerful when it goes beyond the top-down/bottom-up mentality.\n\n", "created_at": "2011-11-12 12:03:03", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:04.439985", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 528, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26422, "user_id": 9, "topic_id": 2871, "post_number": 11, "raw": "<b>:)</b>\n\nThis is really beautiful and important.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-29 06:48:56", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:26.389750", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 10, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24278, "user_id": 2754, "topic_id": 520, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Thanks &amp; tickets</b>\n\n<a href=\"/u/winnieponcelet\">@</a><a about=\"/en/users/winnieponcelet\" datatype=\"\" href=\"/u/winnieponcelet\" property=\"foaf:name\" title=\"View user profile.\" typeof=\"sioc:UserAccount\" xml:lang=\"\">WinniePoncelet</a>\u00a0Thanks.

Thanks a lot for being there for everyone though!\n\nLet me think out loud about the list a little.\n\nYou need to give a lot of information in very little time. It is important that it can be understood quickly. It is also important that people understand why some things are better than other things. Here is what I would try:\n\nTry to use a combination of images and text, a little like a meme. The image is most important (says more than 1000 words) and will ideally explain most of the things that have been discussed in many hours before. Ideally the people who are really deep into the topic do a thorough image search and you pool them together, and then photoshop or redraw. Of course one image (even if it is very good) can't explain everything, that is why you need a little text (english, greek, arabic probably). Similar to <a href=\"https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.proprojectorsllc.com%2Febay%2Fshop4cap%2FParts%2FLP820%2Flp820shem.jpg&amp;f=1\">this</a> (called \"exploded view) or <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/9832302@N08/3916003365/\">this</a> (but so you can photocopy it - so brighter and increased contrast) or <a href=\"https://starfishtherapies.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/backpack-safety1.gif?w=500&amp;h=336\">this</a> (the words explain the \"why\" not the item, if it is too difficult use another illustration). You may want to have one page for as a sort of inventory and one page as a sort of manual (e.g. there is <a href=\"https://youtu.be/dOAD5nr4IgM?t=416\">a lot</a> you <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5E2rjakS60\">can do</a> with the <a href=\"http://seattlebackpackersmagazine.com/50-uses-for-an-emergency-blanket/\">space blanket</a> that needs <a href=\"http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/22%C2%BD-uses-for-emergency-mylar-space-blankets-03242014\">a little extra info</a> (maybe Lizzie could also check the list?)).\n\nSome more things I thought of:\n\n- It is much easier to get kids to wash their hands while they play with something. Small pebbles or pearls also rub the hands so they get cleaned much better. Kids are big bacteria spreaders. More on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L25C768kkK4\">hygiene</a>. You can make a sink with the space blanket and duct tape, or an old plastic ice cream package (1L weighs 30g).\n\n- for washing clothes you can use the space blanket.\n\n- I would recommend 3 (ziplock?) plastic bags with sugar (perhaps with stevia - more weight efficient), salt, and a piece of soap. One bag big enough for <a href=\"http://thenaturalpenguin.com/2015/11/how-to-make-an-alternative-hot-water-bottle/\">this hot water \"bottle\"</a>. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xV2gsWHhDhY\">Heating</a> or use hot rock or sand.\n\n- <a href=\"https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.briggscorp.com%2Fimg_catalog%2F16_909_Lr.jpg&amp;f=1\">sterile saline solution</a> (smallest possible), if you need more desinfected water, you can also boil\n\n- a comb (or just half)\n\n- vasiline (part for real use, but more for \"magic cream\" placebo effect)\n\n- kids earplugs (use alcohol to desinfect!), probably smart to tie in a piece of string for safety.\n\n- antiseptic wipes (can be \"refilled\" with alcohol)\n\n- in terms of clothes I would try to reduce cotton. Wool is fine for warmth if you have a windbreaker, if you can have at least one set of synthetic undergarments as they dry much faster than cotton.\n\n- personally I love wool leg warmers combined with short wool socks in the outdoors. Socks can be swapped and kept dry without much extra weight. The warmers can be regulated while walking and can be also used in many different ways. I'm not sure if they work well for kids though.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-11-09 09:56:58", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:11.577977", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 698, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 6.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [11600], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2272, "user_id": 1561, "topic_id": 2239, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hi all\n\nJust wanted to share a couple of thoughts with you all.\u00a0\n\n<span>I think that right now\u00a0Africa is the most exciting continent in the world!\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Cellphone penetration and internet access have never been higher;\u00a0the rise of the<span>\u00a0</span>African middle class,\u00a0the growing number of African graduates and the return of younger generations of the African diaspora\u00a0are factors that are\u00a0driving business and economic development in new and dynamic ways;\u00a0and</span><span>\u00a0African innovation</span><span>\u00a0</span><span>in science, technology and medicine is changing how we farm, how we communicate and how long we live.\u00a0</span><span>\n\n</span>\n\n<span>What we are experiencing is a\u00a0surge in the\u00a0spirit of possibility,\u00a0driven by young people across the continent.

In an urban garden in Bucharest, Crina is growing something else: corn, herbs, broccoli or goji. She is splitting her time between freelancing and tutoring as an art graduate, gardening and raising her three year old as a single mom. She earns around 120 eur/month, dismal even for Romanian standards, although Crina insists that for someone becoming self-sufficient this is enough. She lives with her parents at the edge of the city on a road called Gura Siriului. Her parents\u2019 big victory was to obtain from the City hall ownership of the land nearby their apartment which they had been stewarding for years as Crina and her four brothers were growing up. Upon splitting it, Crina is now the proud owner of 400 sq metres and finds herself vested in this heritage: \u201cIt\u2019s the only fortune I ever got\u201d, she told me.\n\n![img](/uploads/default/original/2X/c/cd0449e8a022f611f745f4735d5abaec1aa5cafa.jpg)\n\n[b]Slowing down at a young age?[/b]\n\nC: \u201cIt sort of came together even from being an arts student, you know, in that environment with a lot of mini-egos making believe everyone they\u2019re different, myself included. And then having grown up with parents who were forcefully relocated in the city by communists.. they felt the need to re-connect to the countryside and used to come here in the garden after work to grow potatoes, corn. While growing up, we the children were also doing stuff like this, also hanging with goats.\u201d\n\nCrina doesn\u2019t have a plan: \u201cYes, I\u2019d want to be able to support myself out of this, but if it doesn\u2019t work out I\u2019ll have to change path. But of course I\u2019d love that..  The plan is turning the garage into a ceramic workshop, and build a small house. I wanted an earthship house if you know what I mean, a passive house consuming very little, with an interior garden.. well, a live organism. Afterwards the idea changed, because Romania is too exotic for the idea of earthship. I still hope to build my own house but for this I need money, and currently I only do gardening to get a sense of it.\u201d\n\nShe dreams of making permaculture more accessible to her neighbors, and through her actions make others understand the logic of the earth: \u201cthey go on and on with digging and delving. That\u2019s why people say wow, Monsanto, because they see how from a bug rotted, sunburn seed they get corn. They\u2019re unaware of the force, that there are drought times when maybe one doesn\u2019t need to eat as much. Our society has lost the notion of hunger, the one that makes you save.\u201d\n\n![img](/uploads/default/original/2X/f/fdfffb2d700332c3fe550ea15e5c7205419ddd45.jpg) \n\n[b]How do you make urban gardening sexy?[/b]\n\nCrina wants to be part of a community, and for a couple times the more known groups in the city (e.g. folks at Gradini urbane comunitare) came and helped improvise a vertical parcel for growing corn. Other people occasionally drop by, like the young couple who came in at the same time I met Crina to ask for a small parcel where they could extend their own apartment experiment into something outdoors and more spacious. They and Crina will be sharing the crops 50%-50%. Even with ad hoc encounters like this, Crina admits her biggest challenge is to bring people in to help her organize and make the gardening work more efficient.\n\nShe is aware any proposition to potential guests should be convincing about what their own benefits would be. In a city where people are eager to get behind initiatives branded as cool, inviting them all the way to the margins is challenging. At the idea of land sharing that I suggested, C. responded that her mom isn\u2019t ready to cede ownership of the land, having been so hard to acquire it in the first place.\n\nSo without a plan but however part of a movement of sorts, it made me think that Crina can\u2019t afford to take it upon her shoulders and turn her lifestyle into a mission for the sake of it; she is also awaiting an opportunity to go completely rural. There is nothing that her own land and kid whom she\u2019ll be homeschooling could not make up for.\n\nI will end with something Crina said which sums up a collective tragedy: \u201cThe land is worth around 40K eur, but people don\u2019t want to buy it, so it\u2019s worth nothing\u201d. Apparently the lack of asphalt to connect the road to the garden entrance is driving down interest and is also a signified of distanced communities inhabiting different cities in one. So I would keep in mind a question I overheard from the two visitors of Crina\u2019s who were eager to experiment outdoor gardening: Do watermelons grow in an apartment?

When ever an adolescent brings up a topic around \u00a0reproductive health or sex \u00a0education, they are usually severely punished \u00a0and regarded as been disrespectful to their elders. Due to this absence of discussion on sex education, many adolescent young girls face lots of challenges and stigma at their puberty stage, especially during menstruation.Most parents in Cameroon especially in the rural and grassroots areas, don't know that they have to provide pads for their girl children during menstruation. They don't even give their girls advice when these children even summon a little courage to inform them that something abnormal is happening with them .According to many parents, these children are very immature and still very young to be able to handle understand and process issues on puberty , reproductive health and menstruation. Because of this lack of discussion between parents and children on sex education, many of these girls, during menstruation are forced to stay away from school because of stigma from boys who often notice blood stains on their uniforms and also the unpleasant odor which \u00a0cames out of the bodies as a result. \u00a0Their staying away from school, makes them not to be performant as they ought to be like the boys and this plays a key role for their poor performances. Some stay away for two weeks and others for a month, just to avoid this stigma. As a youth advocate to encourage parent children dialogue on sex education and advoacting for Access to reproductive health knowledge, i have had time to hold some trainings with a few groups of adolescent girls to tell me about their experiences. \u00a0As a result of lack of menstrual hygiene, due to absence of \u00a0dialogue between them and their parents, \u00a0i was amazed by the stories i got. Some said, as they approached their parents \u00a0when\u00a0they noticed boold stains on their pants, they were thoroughly scolded and driven away and warned never to discuss any thing on menstruation. Some said, they were forced to carry dry dust and sand to\u00a0insert into their vaginas in order to stop the bleeding as they knew not what was happening to them. Other stories came up like using \u00a0dirty clothes to pad themselves, which was very in hygienic and gave them some genital infections. \u00a0As a result of this lack of knowledge on reproductive health for adolescent girls, many have dropped out of school because of unintended pregnancies, some have contracted sexually transmissable infections and others have been forced into early marriages , to the boys that impregnated them. Many of these \u00a0adolecents have lost hope for a better future, because they are now in condtions due to necglect and lack of reproductive health knowledge. \u00a0so i am hoping to enlightened parents and the community about the importance of sex education and also advocating for this curriculum to be taught in primary and secondary schools in Cameroon. I am hoping, to equally train these adolescent girls on matters of gender equality, menstrual hygiene , family planning and reproductive health as a Whole. In Africa, there is an ardage which says \"Charity begins at home\" if \u00a0discussions between parents and children are initiated at home on sex education, it will go an extra mile to enable parents understand their daughters and support them effectively , so that they will not be statistics of unwanted pregnancies , school drop outs and poor academic performance in school. If Access to knowledge on reproductive health is improved upon \u00a0for parents and adolescent girls, then sustainable development will be ensured. I believe that women and girls form an essential link in sustainable development.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-24 00:22:06", "updated_at": "2017-10-06 15:09:16.187951", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 632, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 236.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7289, "user_id": 1003, "topic_id": 5021, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>pinned!</b>\n\nhttps://www.pinterest.com/costantinob/opencare/\n\n", "created_at": "2015-12-07 14:27:38", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:42.848732", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 11, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32963, "user_id": 2657, "topic_id": 4370, "post_number": 58, "raw": "Dear Nadia,\n\nthanks for the quick reply.

Could tell me, what's your idea to use social media to engage people in this online platform - first to bring them here, and them make them use it on a longer term? How do you make connections with people most effectively in your country?

Would be great to establish social media groups and great interesting cases forwarded via posts within the social media community. Good idea is to make some short video as to the projects and enhance discussions (a la kickstarter page, with description of the project, some videos of the projects, some video conferences for those interested to partner, contribute or being involved. Good enough would be to establish separate section that will include news, interesting articles and reports or researchers on social programs, activities or enhancement of needed skills, expertise for the social project development. It can be a separate media project for social projects functions, skills, news within the platform (with interesting video reports, video/online text discussions etc</span>\n\n<span>I would be happy to discuss these ideas and more via skype and email.

(! very cool idea, endorsed also by hosting team who\u2019d be arriving to Matera early to help)\n\n<strong>On venue &amp; capacity:</strong> the number of registered participants is now at 104, but not everyone is sure to attend. Starting <strong>September\u00a025th</strong>\u00a0we\u2019ll reach out to see who is definitely coming (community management task assigned to myself). The unMonastery building is far from being able to attend to this many, but either way, we want and we will manage to get everyone in. To do so, Ilaria and Rita will be booking additional venues nearby. Some options that have been mentioned: Palazzotto: hosts 10 people, Incubatore: 30 people, Le Monacelle: 30 people, Casa Cava: 80 people.\n\n<strong>Accommodation</strong>: although the intention was there to collect information about everyone\u2019s arrival and match people\u2019s dates with available B&amp;Bs, we agreed the organizational effort is too big, people are planning their trips at different moments. So in the end we\u2019ve decided to publish a list with places and the cheapest rates negotiated and encourage everyone to book on their own. More on this as soon as we have the list. Thanks to Giuseppe for helping out with ideas!\n\n<strong>Event agenda:</strong>\u00a0<span>Bembo and\u00a0Dorotea in particular are in favor of having a very loose program framework, with many empty slots and possibility to come up with topics ad hoc, like at past Lotes.

What we do need as soon as possible is an aggregated, easy to read table view of the sessions and their coordinators so far, and how much time is required per session.\u00a0</span><span>An internal deadline to arrange all existing sessions in a very tentative timeframe has been set to <strong>September 15</strong></span><strong><span>th</span></strong><span>. Alberto, Ben and Noemi \u2013 the three track coordinators will take care of this, unless someone else wants to coordinate the tracks.</span>\n\nAm I missing something? Lots of things are happening in Matera and getting an overview on all the loose ends there is getting difficult, so all efforts to communicate that are highly appreciated. That way many more Edgeryders could help, even from the distance! :-)\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-09-06 11:16:31", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:09.891577", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 627, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 15.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9214, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2840, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>I'm impressed!</b>\n\nVery good work, everyone, and thanks <a href=\"/u/inge\">@Inge</a>\u00a0for such a comprehensive writeup.\n\nI would like to engage on everything you said, because the conversation feels like it was so vibrant and relevant! But I will limit myself to a couple of points.\u00a0\n\n<span>The discussion on zero-sum competition amongst NGOs, <a href=\"/u/nadia\">@Nadia</a>\u00a0tells me, was replicated almost word for word in today's workshop in <span>Cairo</span>. I have found this before, for example in the art world: I have found it to depend not on people's individual attitudes, but on market structure. If NGOs are \"spenders\" - i.e. they do projects that do not generate any revenue \u2013 and the funders are few, competition is perforce zero sum. One lari given to NGO A will not go to NGO B. Over time, NGOs come to perceive each other as enemies.</span>\n\nHowever, we could try to disrupt zero-sum by trying to build a small prototype that would be funded elsewhere. Here's what I can propose:<span> Georgia, it turns out, can participate at least in some of the European Union's funding programmes under the Horizon 2020 umbrella (<a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2014_2015/annexes/h2020-wp1415-annex-a-countries-rules_en.pdf\">source</a>). Edgeryders is itself a EU company; a couple of months ago we did the paperwork to be a sanctioned participant in Horizon 2020, as several people in the community are interested (this conversation is in the <a href=\"/t/horizon-2020-collaborator/347\">Horizon 2020 Collaborator</a> project; in fact, just this week we submitted our first proposal). We might help in finding some other like-minded partner in the EU \u2013 I would love to work with <a href=\"/u/lasindias\">@lasindias</a>\u00a0in Spain, for example.</span>\n\n<span>So, if you guys want to consider having a few Georgian NGO collaborating on a meaningful project, we could offer ourselves as EU partners and try and find a suitable EU call. This way, you can collaborate without risking to jeopardize your existing sources of funding. Then, if you like the experience, you may decide to try and collaborate some more. I am sure the <a href=\"http://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/georgia/index_en.htm\">EU delegation to Georgia</a> would be happy to help. How does that sound? We could even do a project on boosting adoption of open source software, a topic dear to our heart and on which there is plenty of expertise in the community.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Moving from open source to <em>very</em> closed source and proprietary software and data, I appreciate you want to stay in touch through your tool of choice, Facebook. Edgeryders, however, will not follow you there. We are not being territorial; on the contrary, we believe Facebook is not conducive to sharing knowledge.\u00a0 We have learned the hard way how disempowering it is to commit your precious data and relationships to a large, for-profit corporate with which you have no personal relationship. This conversation we are having here stays with us. We take care of it, make sure it stays available and indexed by search engines. When you look for something on our platform, the search function is simply there to try and help you find what you are looking for, whereas on Facebook what you see is filtered by what Mr. Zuckerberg thinks will make him the most money. Good luck finding a conversation like this on Facebook two years after it has happened.\u00a0</span>\n\nWe hope that in the end your wish to collaborate with us will be strong enough to draw you to the place where we meet and work together. Meanwhile, be well and be strong, for many great things await.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-25 23:16:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:53.034140", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 720, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16572, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1307, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Feedback is ready!</b>\n\nSo, Carlo, here I am again. I browsed briefly opinionage (and even took part in one of the voting arenas) to get a feel for it. It is very professional and smooth-running, congratulations!\n\nHowever, are you sure you wanted to build an instrument for political participation? The framing of \"choose A or B\", in fact, lends itself to all sort of stuff, and not just public decision: marketing polls (select the voice for our video), prediction markets (is the price of gold going to go up or down?), playful interaction (which dress should I wear to the party?).\n\n\u00a0 In my understanding, public decisions are made in the context of administrative processes. Think of administrative processes as computer programmes: they call subroutines that run and move the process forward. For example, \"decide the priorities for vocational training in Friuli\" could be a subroutine of the master programme \"7 year Framework Programme of the European Commission\", to which many administrative levels, from the European to at least the regional one are called to contribute over several years.\n\nGiven all this, you need a lot of sheer luck for a decision maker to stumble into citizen input that fits exactly the decision she has to make, exactly at the right time. Normally this will just not happen: citizen input will accumulate and, typically, lie unused. At this point, citizens will become disillusioned and impatient, and leave the process.\n\nPerhaps the only way to solve this is for an institution to adopt opinionage as its own tool, and push out exactly those questions that they are addressing at the moment. This would make it open government, something that at the moment opinionage is not (open government, after all, is still government, and as such requires public sector protagonism). Should you decide to frame it this way, I would suggest you consider a few improvements. First of all, there is the issue that some administrations are not at ease with software-as-service. And rightly so: if civil servants engage with citizens during their working hours, it is only fair that the institution owns the database where those interaction are recorded.\n\nSecond of\u00a0 all, in my experience most administrations are intimidated by citizen engagement, which can be quite aggressive, and look for mechanisms to steer the social dynamics towards constructive outcomes. The core social dynamic of opinionage, unfortunately, is \"for or against\", which by definition tends to polarization rather than convergence!\n\n", "created_at": "2012-02-15 17:56:13", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:32.770436", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 426, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31452, "user_id": 243, "topic_id": 5044, "post_number": 34, "raw": "<b>server error </b>\n\nwhen I enter your profile I get server error so can't easily find ways to send you private message with the number ...\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-12-27 14:56:01", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:52.955139", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 30, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [31402], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18691, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1246, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Verrouillage</b>\n\nLe seul mod\u00e8le que nous poss\u00e9dons, dans toute la Francophonie (et c'est tirer par les cheveux, car il s'agit d'un gouvernement anglophone dans un pays bilingue), et qui fonctionne admirablement bien, qui produise des r\u00e9sultats rapides avec tr\u00e8s peu de moyens financiers, et qui est louang\u00e9 par tous, c'est celui du gouvernement de la Colombie-Britannique.\n\nAvant d'\u00eatre premi\u00e8re ministre, Christy Clark a annonc\u00e9 pendant sa campagne \u00e9lectorale son intention de devenir le premier ministre le plus branch\u00e9 au Canada, et de faire un gouvernement ouvert.\n\nUne fois \u00e9lue, Christy Clark a simplement dit, 'Bon, j'ai dit que je ferais cela, on fait cela.'

Bucharest is a capital city, home to around 2 million people, and caters to 6 sectors, each with its own city hall. You can imagine we can only start small. Spot the Future Bucharest is an <strong>open experiment to discover citizens who wholeheartedly try to improve even a tiny aspect of their community\u2019s life: cultural organisers, artists and activists, also hackers, social innovators, people in sustainability and new lifestyle movements</strong>, and so on. We expect a lot of them to be the Edgeryders kind. For those who don\u2019t know us yet, Edgeryders is a community of people across the world who build, invent, connect, map, grow, occupy, all for the better cause - to create value in the environments in which we move. \n\n##Whatever path you are walking, whatever risk you are taking, we want to meet you!\n\nA European capital of culture is not just about cultural institutions, or culture as arts. On the contrary, a city belongs to all its citizens, and the fact that Bucharest is running for the ECOC title is most attractive not for the win itself, but for the chance to (re)position with respect to its strategic future. See this as a door open to make yourself and promising projects in the city/neighborhoods visible to people who could join your efforts, even if the city doesn\u2019t win.\n\nSpot the Future lives here on Edgeryders, as it is part of a bigger story of working in global networks via open collaboration. We use the Internet because it is (still, somewhat) free-as-in-speech, it\u2019s cheap, and enables people to connect beyond borders. Which is why in this project we welcome anyone and everyone. See it as an invitation to share your story with your peers, get advice and connect to initiatives globally.\n\n* what projects are you currently involved in?\n\n* what future do you see coming into play in Romania and who is driving it?\n\n* who else should we meet that is doing inspiring work?\n\n##It\u2019s radically open. How can you get involved?\n\nSpot the Future Bucharest starts from a blank page, which means we build it together:\n\n* [b]Online[/b]. In the next following weeks, we are going to meet each other [here in this group online.](/en/spot-the-future-bucharest) Start by introducing yourself, your work, your life, by [creating a post](/node/add/post?og_group_ref=4581).\nThe group is entirely open, the more diverse people join us the more honest the conversation will be. We will be coordinating so that any news or opportunity comes in, it is shared with everyone via this channel.\n\n* [b]Offline[/b]. We will do physical meetups in Bucharest, also in the following weeks. These are as informal as it gets, mostly a chance for quality conversation over beer. If you would like to host one, it would be great, let us know?\n\n* [b]Collaboratively.[/b] In July we get to design a workshop to show the world what our vision of the future is: it can be a projects fair, a hackathon, an unConference, whatever the community wants. If you want to partner up and join a team of organisers, tell us know how you see yourself involved.\n\n* [b]Join the nascent Edgeryders Int\u2019l Cultural Team! [/b]Working the second time around with a candidate city for European Capital of Culture (ECOC) is not a happy accident. In Matera we succeeded to signal that connecting social innovators can weigh in the bid process and radically help re-think culture by running open processes and building alliances with international movements. Matera ended up running with a concept around \u201copen future\u201d.  As we wait to be involved in the next phase, now that it won, we want to pursue more work in the field of ECOCs as a distributed team, and Bucharest is a live test bed. We can bring networked social change at the forefront, while giving community members opportunities to act as conveners in their towns, access paid work and travel in ever new places. If you want to get involved, you\u2019re most welcome to come visit, I have a spare room. Every year cities in Europe are applying for a cultural capital title, maybe you would like to approach your own? Get in touch, we think we can help!\n\n\nAnything else you have in mind? The easiest way to get something started is by leaving a comment below (you need to be [signed up](/user/register) on Edgeryders).

The way the meeting was managed made also a difference. In fact City of Milan started \u201cadmitting\u201d that the law (see above) was created without enough stakeholders\u2019 engagements and it resulted in limited compliances. The meeting was the occasion to amend the situation by experimenting a talk at a different level based more on moral suasion than power games.\n\nWhen @Rossana introduced the Open care approach and @Costantino talked about the co-design method, people were interested as well as suddenly engaged. It seems it worked. Since we announced we\u2019d organize a couple of co-design sessions, we\u2019ll see how many people will actively engage.\n\nIn her introductory speech, the City councilor Cristina Tajani\u00a0said that helping enforcing this law isn\u2019t just fair and mandatory, but it may also turn economically profitable for local businesses. Implying that more accessible businesses might have more clients among disabled and caregivers, but also among people that favors living in an equal opportunity neighborhood. This is the point to me. I have the feeling that this initiative is going to be successful here (a track of what\u2019s going on will be provided as it happens) because of the nature of this area.\n\nThis place, even if it\u2019s recently gentrified, succeeded in keeping its original community spirit. There are plenty of small independent shops, recreational spaces, associations and spontaneous groups. People who cares. In other words it doesn\u2019t take a single specific reason to wish shops and restaurants to be accessible for all. People, at times, might just follow their sense of community and contribute. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-04-21 12:40:37", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:11.446754", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 406, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 11.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28232, "user_id": 2569, "topic_id": 5801, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>i can do tomorrow 9:30 CET</b>\n\nWorks for me here.\n\nOtherwise we can look at a time on Thursday\n\n", "created_at": "2016-08-09 19:28:39", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:35.640194", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 26, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6708, "user_id": 10, "topic_id": 1066, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>See you in Paris!</b>\n\nHey Nadia, it looks like there's a big Edgeryders crowd gathering!\n\nYou, Kat, Max, Elf, Helene...\n\n...any one else...Alberto, Matthias, Ben?\n\n", "created_at": "2013-04-29 16:32:42", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:39.435161", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 34, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1885, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 1852, "post_number": 1, "raw": "In attendance: @Alberto, @havartu, @Dorotea, David, Michael, @Elena_Karlsen, @K11, @Nadia, @Angela_Radford, @Joecorneli, @Noemi\n\n\n## Logistics\n\nOpportunity: people in Matera are making offers for free accommodations! We need to build on the momentum and come up with a process and algorithm to allocate a limited number of places as fairly as possible.\n\nThreat: the upcoming unMonastery has a limited capacity and there won\u2019t be enough room for hundreds of Lote participants. A guesstimate is around 50 places for sure in the space, but need to check with [andrea.paoletti]. We expect the number of registered participants to double in upcoming months, as well as the number of people actually joining to drop down at about half. <span>** Tentative</span><span> extra capacity for Lote venue(s): Comitato Matera has some meeting rooms, also the Incubator across the street from the unMonastery.</span>\n\n\n## Fundraising and partnership building\n\n<span>We need to secure at least some resources to support participants\u2019 travels and conference costs. This service is currently ran by Nadia, she\u2019s been in touch with several organisations but needs help in:</span>\n\n<span>1. identifying relevant organisations able to get involved right now</span>\n\n<span>2. preparing an offer that could be relevant in a format that they recognize</span>\n\n<span>3. build a template with our general offer that appeals to entities who come across Edgeryders by chance</span><span>.</span>\n\nInsight: Even when organisations have a declared goal of e.g. tackling youth unemployment, they are skeptical to shake hands and buy into a novel methodology. A considerable effort is being put into getting key people into the right room and context where you can pitch Edgeryders.

That was my foundation. I moved to Galway City when I was about 8. I was lucky to go to an alternative 'Educate Together' primary school. They teach people to care about people and planet and to think for themselves. I went to a typical Irish secondary school which I left at 16 to do a horticulture course for two years.\n\nI then took a variety of courses, trying to figure out what I wanted to do. I studied massage for two years and practiced for a while but I took a step back from that. I hope to get back to it one day, I like healing people.\n\nWhen I was 22 I started volunteering in the Galway Community Circus teaching kids contemporary circus arts (no animals!) and learning skills myself. I taught and learned there for two years. It was so important in my journey; I discovered my first hobby, first sport, my circus freak family and my love of working with children. I'm massively interested in 'Social Circus'. I believe recreation activities, hobbies, and the social and personal development aspects of these are hugely beneficial to people.\n\nFor a few years friends and I trained together. We occasionally did circus shows and workshops at festivals and events.\n\nNow we have a performance group in training called Hoopla Troupla. We have performed and done workshops at a number of charity and community events and festivals in Ireland. My favourite disciplines are fire dancing and being a human puppet. I also practice/teach hula hoop and poi. And I dance. A lot. My stage name is Dancing Duey.\n\nI started doing social media work 5 years ago. One of my creations is a facebook group 'House Hunting Galway (for sound people)\u2019, facilitating people to network to find housing and house mates. It\u2019s really important to have a safe space to live with people who suit you. The group grew to 26,000 people and counting. Another facebook group I started is Galway Underground Gigs, which has 6,000 members. I\u2019m always connecting people with the right people, projects and events. Galway is a magic place that draws people here from all over the world, and I get to meet the most inspirational people.\n\nI worked as a youth work assistant for a year and now I\u2019m doing a degree in Business, Enterprise and Community Development. I never thought I'd do third level education, being a more practical, hands-on learner, but this degree is helping me to merge my ideas and skills with community development, enterprise, youth work and circus.\n\nMy dream is to create an alcohol-free social and entertainment venue in Galway. Ireland desperately needs alcohol-free spaces. An inclusive space for people to come together with music, dancing and activities, with rooms for workshops, classes and meetings.\u00a0\n\nFinally I really want to get back to nature for some grounding and get back to my roots. Taking part in An \u00c1it Eile\u2019s pre-unMonastery event, a \u201cRural Reconnaissance\u201d at Cregg Castle reminded me of that. Nature is life.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-01-12 21:19:00", "updated_at": "2017-10-06 08:12:47.112347", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 599, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 12.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21132, "user_id": 1450, "topic_id": 3940, "post_number": 5, "raw": "oh, hang on...if we aren't showing comments or comment cloud, we should also turn off the 'add comment' tab in the tagging interface.

You have designed an elegant system in your head (\"all tools are interoperable, so each person can use whatever she wants and still communicate with every other person\"). Since it is elegant, you are sure that if you build it they will come. Everything is artefact-driven: who has the best tech wins.\u00a0\n\nI don't believe that is true. If humans are out of the picture, the picture cannot help be incomplete. The most obvious example in your post is the case of Piersoft, who I know reasonably well by now. In his case, I am pretty sure it is much more a case of English vs. Italian than it is a case of Facebook vs. Edgeryders. I know this because we interact on other channels, including the MT2019 one: a Drupal platform explicitly modelled on Edgeryders. Other things you overlook include lock-in effects, idiosyncracies, and predictions. Example of prediction: how likely is it that Loomio (or Drupal, or anything) will be around in five years? And in ten? The rational thing to do here is to go for multipurpose tech (so you can hack it around to do whatever you want) that has a large user base and a large developer community.\u00a0\n\nI think it is moot to try to fix our internal comms from the top. You will not succeed, because comms are about the people, and their maddening and endearing imperfection. What you can do is try things out <em>yourself</em>. And if they work, people will use them, and they will spread. Engaging lots of smart people in the community in a sort of engineering effort? I don't think there's likely to be a payoff. I am out.\u00a0\n\nPS \u2013 I also think that collective deliberation is way overrated, as it gets people debating rather than getting things done. Occasionally it is is needed. But, as Rick Falkvinge likes to say on swarms, \"you must under no account let the swarm discuss its purpose. If people don't like what the swarm is doing, they will simply walk out and join another swarm, or start their own\". It is the same principle that makes \"voting with your feet\" at unconferences get things done, and political assemblies... not.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-05-18 17:01:10", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:00.022405", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 406, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19697, "user_id": 3686, "topic_id": 734, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>similarities </b>\n\nthe medical issues \u00a0seem to be the same as the golden foot collective.\n\nworking in the migrant crisis. any thoughts on how to deal with scabbies in precious situations?\u00a0\n\nbe well\u00a0\n\nMd\n\n", "created_at": "2017-07-05 11:15:17", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:49.716905", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 46, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 1.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19766, "user_id": 1003, "topic_id": 4977, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Thanks!</b>\n\n<img alt=\"yes\" height=\"23\" src=\"/profiles/commons/libraries/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/thumbs_up.png\" title=\"yes\" width=\"23\">\n\n", "created_at": "2015-11-17 16:22:28", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:50.082739", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 27, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29981, "user_id": 1687, "topic_id": 3624, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>true</b>\n\nMaybe you are right.

Which becomes problematic in the long run for making the case for artists being paid. We never had that conversation when I left; it was always an inner thought process.\n\nI left to go to Berlin for 6 months, to clear the plate and try something new. I though if I continue doing this it is not sustainable in my life because I had to find paid work to keep me fed and pay rent. I am 30 year old female, and me and my partner are thinking about children, something has got to give because I can\u2019t do this anymore, so I made the decision to leave around that and to find paid work to do what I wanted to do. What I was always interested in was where we were placed and what we could do in that location.\u00a0 Although there is a massive drive forward with education departments, and most arts and cultural organization have those. That is where the thinking happens, how do we work with local groups that are coming out of local governments being under-served. I think for me that is where I was interested, how the building could be used by all members of the public, how it could be used regularly with people becoming more involved in making themselves and learning how artist could be more connected with working in the area.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/d/da6a994bed5d3081a49b4597d2c6bbe65707da4f.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\"><br>There was quite a lot of interest in the community center there and us being able to come down and volunteer and help. I remember at the time people mentioned that their interest in having us there: they could see it being a re-generation project and they wanted to essentially tart it up before the Commonwealth games. And revamp the Barrows market. There are complicated issues. We were there for a long time and it was, I only speak for me in relation to this, from the community there was a couple of people who expressly stated that having artists and architects working in the area and it being seen as achievable, as that being that an option, was something that was attractive for them to be able to think about with their own family members. As that might not be seen as a viable option, or done normally, or have been encouraged in school et cetera<strong>.</strong> I definitely was not encouraged to do it in school, to take it to an art school level. Just us being there and doing things could potentially be another option and another way of going in life as opposed to what was being cooked up in career fairs and job centers. That is what I was interested in.\n\nI now work in the public sector and look at employment for artist and expressive arts in schools and in adult education.\u00a0 In the city I am now doing it in, the public sector it is a whole, massive different ball game.\n\nI have seen it from both ends in terms of stewardship, where going from being a group of people who decide to taking over an asset that is clearly crumbling. It was a private landlord, she has 4 kids, she did not have the capacity to do that kind of thing on her own that was her interest she always wanted to save this beautiful building and put it to public use.\u00a0 We were running that, but as certain points we were doing that 30 hours a week alongside some of us having children and I was doing paid work, also trying to keep your own (artistic) work going, which generally does not happen. And the point is, you are trying to make space and time for people to think and suddenly, it is the classic thing, you end up having no time or space to think. So you enter a cycle which you trying to stop. I don think it is necessarily how it has to go, I definitely think organizations like that can be helped massively from the start by seeking out external help and advice. And balancing it and going at a pace that is fine for everybody. I was kind of going full throttle at different stages. I would say as much help you can get at that stage from elsewhere. Or if there is anyone who can help with the development work, who has that capacity within the local government or in another organization. We definitely had some help both public and private bodies that made huge difference. And some kind of support network would help.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c04666f2a5dcc9069a793658c4f9d486fd9fe1c4.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"458\"><br>When I think about stewardship, I relate it to public services catering or providing funds and infrastructure and resources to provide for all the needs of its public, its community. And where those services perhaps are lacking, stewardship has to kick in from members of the community to take it upon themselves to provide those things. One of them is voluntary and one is paid. Questions come to who is it that is able to do that. Who is in the position financially to do that, who is in the position time wise, who is in the position physically or mentally to do these things. The difference now in the kind of programs I was trying to run and the research I was doing. There are things that now coming at it from the end of the person who is supposed to provide that service and figure out how you do that looking at community centers and village homes, libraries; lots of empty homes and empty spaces. We have programs to help people create creative spaces. \u00a0I am in a city that is not like Glasgow, it does not have artists creative centers at all. You then have to make decisions about what you fund and whose culture it is that you are funding and whose is it that you are championing. And how is it that you are defining what that is and where are those ideas coming from. Are they coming from people who live there or where are they coming from? Are they coming from my own homogenized art school vision of what art is? There are a lot of complicated questions in there.\n\nWhat I am talking about a lot is cultural democracy. And also around the labor issues around who does those things. If you work on your own back and you think it is great to have a space, maybe why should anyone pay you until you have proven your worth? You can definitely get a non-profit and still get a wage for directors, I have seen that work, and it was not something that was available to us at the time. What has become interesting to me, working for public service and coming from working off your own back within the community from the ground up, is the difference in the level of motivation, and autonomy and responsiveness, you have personally in doing it. The massive shift that has happened is you kind of lose the ability to put your own stamp on things and externalize your ideas as much because you do have to play an intermediary role and what is interesting, the difference in intrinsic or extrinsic motivation, where when you are doing for yourselves your doing from your projection forward and when you begin to work within a very large organization that seems to become dampened down a little bit. I have only been in my new role for a few months, but when it comes to thinking about how we work with other people, I would definitely say the best people to work with are those who are intrinsically motivated towards doing these things and being involved in these things because I don\u2019t think you would really do it because its hard work taking on buildings and doing them up, essentially you are on call 24 hours. I don\u2019t think you would do it unless you were doing it for the love of it. So while we are seeking out people like that to work with up here, we are trying as much as possible to not having to get them to pay for things, and potentially to be paid and to set up a model so people could be paid and to look in to the sustainability of it because you don\u2019t want to be leading people into a situation where they are just going to burn out.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know, you can tell I am in the middle of trying to figure out these things, I am all over it with my thoughts really. \u00a0There is a lot of tension in all those decisions and these issues.\n\n\u00a0\n\n",

background is in architecture) and decided on doing something more creative and with an impact in the society.\n\nMy first chance was in a project called <a href=\"http://hof.criticalcity.org/\" target=\"_blank\">CriticalCity Upload</a>,\u00a0an urban transformation game, that i developed with a\u00a0 friend (and now a partner in all my professional adventures) <a href=\"/u/augusto_pirovano\">@Augusto_Pirovano</a>.\u00a0We started with a cultural fund, we design and put online the project, we hit some success, and we find a way to keep alive the project for 4 years, instead of 1 (the only funded).\n\nBusiness model and revenues weren\u2019t a thing to pay attention:\n\n\u201cWho cares, we are having an impact, somewhere we will find a way to survive!\u201d\n\nOur business model became a split one, from one side we were developing games and experiences with impact on people\u2019s lives, mostly based on cultural funding, public tenders with a cyclic trend (design the project / get the fund /realize the project / close the project / wait / starve / design a project /and so on\u2026), on the other side it ended up that our only way to pay the bills was to do consultancy works for companies, some of which we were \u201cfighting\u201d with our social game actions.\n\nOvertime we didn\u2019t properly value (except from the know-how) our previous experiences, and after every project we have to dismantle our small company (and lose amazing people) in order to survive without fixed costs and start again looking for new tenders.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that is only an environmental issue, but it\u2019s hard, especially here, to find a company that can survive, in the cultural field, without a continuous help from the public sector.\n\nLong story short.\n\nLast year we finally decided to move to a business model ticket based:\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s ask the money to the people that already loves us!\u201d\n\nWe started an acceleration process and we found some (again private) fund to start our new cultural company.\n\nThe idea was to create the Urban Games\u2019s Pixar, in Italy (<a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/matteouguzzoni1/urban-games-factory-final-presentation\" target=\"_blank\">here is a presentation</a>).\n\nIt ended up that after our first production (<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/24273957@N05/albums/72157657981315616\" target=\"_blank\">a very good looking one </a>) we run (crazily) out of money and the project is now in standby mode.\n\nAgain, we made a lot of mistakes (hell yeah), but somehow I think that cultural and creative industries are by definition on the edge of innovation (and they go further sometimes), so how can we find a right balance to try &gt; fail \u00a0&gt; (but still) survive?\n\nAnd overall, which kind of ways do you see in the next years that will run in this field?\n\n(e.g. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/amissingham?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" target=\"_blank\">Andrew Missingham</a> told me in a workshop that Music had 5 revenue model, now just one is still working and it\u2019s Live Events).\n\nDo you have stories from which we can see how cultural and creative industries are evolving in your country, and if there are models that can be replicated?\n\nBut what i'm interested the most is to hear from your failure, as pioneers and gold-diggers i think we have to develop an obsession from maps (designed on failures) that can help us to imagine what is still unexplored.\n\nOf course this is my narrow point of view and the topic is wide and wild, so please feel free to add your story or suggestions or propose a session. Just post here or write me an email <a href=\"mailto:matteo@focuscoop.it\">matteo@focuscoop.it</a>.\n\nThanks again,\n\nciao!\n\n", "created_at": "2015-11-27 22:31:34", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:29.161605", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 714, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30987, "user_id": 2464, "topic_id": 5571, "post_number": 21, "raw": "<b>Please be specific about your schedule and availability on site</b>\n\nWhen you say booking already made:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>what day/time of arrival</li>\n\n<li>what day/time of departure</li>\n\n</ul>", "created_at": "2016-06-01 00:13:18", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:50.479053", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 36, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [30874], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3151, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3118, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Calling all futurespotters here. I have the honour of being asked to give a talk about Spot The Future at an event called <a href=\"http://europeandcis.undp.org/blog/2014/04/04/the-future-is-now-heres-how-were-planning-to-catch-up/\">Foresight for Development</a>. It will take place in Istanbul on 16-17th of June, under the banners of UNDP-CIS. I am excited about the opportunity to meet people who do good work in foresight, like <a href=\"http://noahraford.com/?page_id=370\">Noah Raford</a>: however, the timing is not right. @Inga Popovaite and <a href=\"/u/brenoust\">@Benjamin Renoust</a>\u00a0are hard at work, but the draft reports will only be ready at our <a href=\"/t/futurespotters-event/410\">Futurespotters event</a>\u00a0at the end of the month.\u00a0The final ones will be then written on the basis of the focus group work we will carry out in Tbilisi.\n\nI will focus mostly on the methodology, of course: but still, it seems like a shame not to give any hint at what is coming through the data. After a conversation with <a href=\"/u/nadia\">@Nadia</a>, I propose to say the following:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>STF methodology has been surprisingly successful in digging out interesting people and projects at the edge that were not on the radar of UNDP country offices. Examples are Jumpstart and the open data scene in Georgia; the tactical urbanism scene in Egypt, as well as individual innovators like <a href=\"/u/abdo\">@Abdo</a>\u00a0with his <a href=\"/wood-works-from-palm-midribs-jozour\">Jozour project</a> or <a href=\"/u/amiridina\">@amiridina</a>\u00a0with her <a href=\"/futurespotters-workshops-the-aftermath/thoughts-for-the-future-from\">Oasis Game</a>. The surprise element comes from the fact that we were able to do this without ever having been in the country and without speaking the language, just working with local connectors. The exception seems to be Armenia, where <a href=\"/u/george\">@Lurglomond</a>\u00a0and his crew already had a good network and we were not as successful as making additions to it (<a href=\"/u/saidhamideh\">@Said Hamideh</a>\u00a0is now running a new outreach operation on Armenian Facebook, let's see if we can make some new discoveries).</li>\n\n<li>There is a clear cross-country thread: everybody seems to perceive the need for more collaborations and better information spread across the three STF countries.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Efforts in fostering collaboration seem to have high returns. Following the physical workshops, we have seen a wave of collaboration and scheming, certainly in-country (Georgians have been holding <a href=\"/t/georgias-futurespotters/575\">bi-weekly meetings</a> ever since), but also with some spillover \u2013 check out <a href=\"/t/carpool-community-in-armenia/2967\">this Armenian-Egyptian conversation</a> about carpooling. \u00a0It will be interesting to see if more cross-country collaboration spawns at Futurespotters in Tbilisi.</li>\n\n<li>Foresight done the Edgeryders way seems to be biased towards action. People are happy to talk about what they do, and that their experiences are used as datapoints for foresight. But, in return for their involvement, they ask for action opportunities. A fairly concrete <a href=\"/georgias-futurespotters/the-viral-academy-georgia-learning-open-source\">project about open source software</a> is being discussed in Georgia, with the involvement of edgeryders from Egypt, Sweden and the UK.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nIf confirmed, these data could be interpreted as a sign that innovators at the edge are reorganizing to take advantage of collective intelligence phenomena, working in a distributed but more informationally connected way. Policy implications would be clear: efforts in bringing people together, building community scaffolding structure, seeding skills, and fostering horizontal community-to-community relationships are likely to help changemakers doing whatever it is they want to do, which will differ from country to country.\n\nDoes this make any sense? Pinging Inga, but also <a href=\"/u/noemi\">@Noemi</a>, <a href=\"/u/inge\">@Inge</a>, <a href=\"/u/vahagn\">@Vahagn</a>, @Hazem, @AhmedMRabie,\u00a0<a href=\"/u/gazbia_sorour\">@gazbee sorour</a>, <a href=\"/u/khatuna\">@Khatuna</a>, <a href=\"/u/george\">@Lurglomond</a>...\u00a0\n\nIn case you are wondering about the photo, it is there because I am riding my motorcycle to Istanbul.

There wasn't any real attachment to keeping it up other than the fact it was meant as a friendly invitation.\u00a0\n\nOn the subject of signage I've been turning this over for the past week since it became a point of controversy, I think I've come up with something interesting that aligns well with the ethos and ideas the unMonastery strives for. For lack of photoshop, I've mocked it up quickly and attached below, using on an online editor. The basic concept is to create a modular and adaptable sign that can evolve as the project does - the main organisational symbol/sign sits in the centre, whilst the supporting organisations or networks fill in the surrounding circles. In this instance of unMonastery it will be MT2019, EdgeRyders, Open Tech School. The fundamental design principle being that it broadcasts to those encountering the building that there is still capacity for additional collaboration - it also allows for icons to be removed to reflect changing relationships, including the lead organisational.\u00a0\n\nIn the next week I'm going to approach local artisans to see if something like this could be produced by someone living in Matera. What are you thoughts to this approach?\u00a0\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b430f4997bbf1478065cd27a4fc7efdf5d769df5.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\nOn the broader subject of strong branding and uniforms etc - this was something that I purposely didn't push myself in the lead up. Although it certainly is tradition to leave ones identity at the door upon entering the monastery, and giving up all wordly possesions. This is borderline cult territory in contempoary society and would scare people, justifably.\n\nSo\u00a0I felt it better to broach this as subject during the prototype and assess how it could be deployed in a future iteration. I've been reading this book recently by Adrian Hon, [thejaymo] has previously referenced it in relation to EdgeRyders.

I temi che mi piacerebbe innestare in tale \"laboratorio\" sarebbero, per esempio, la realizzazione di ausili personalizzati, l'avvio di progetti di vita indipendente, la progettazione e la realizzazione di soluzioni residenziali avanzate, la riqualificazione del tessuto sociale e la co-realizzazione di iniziative con le pubbliche amministrazioni (vedi <a href=\"/t/in-2017-were-pushing-the-community-further-with-the-reef-and-the-pop-up-village-want-to-join/6064\">https://edgeryders.eu/en/the-reef/in-2017-were-pushing-the-community-further-with-the-reef-and</a>).\n\nVorrei inoltre comprendere se, nel corso del primo anno di vita del \"prototipo\" a Bruxelles, sia stato quanto meno ipotizzato per gli aspiranti \"fondatori\" un percorso informativo e formativo, da realizzare sopratutto attraverso una opportuna piattaforma digitale, sugli aspetti internazionali europei riguardanti i finanziamenti internazionali e la disciplina unitaria del crowdfounding e crowdsourcing agevolata da forme di imprenditorialit\u00e0 sociale transnazionale, sulle modalit\u00e0 di adesione ad iniziative di ricerca e sviluppo tramite clustering tecnico scientifico che preveda la costituzione di realt\u00e0 permanenti ad hoc oltre che considerandone tutte le implicazioni giuridiche e legali.\n\nGiungendo infine ad un livello pi\u00f9 pratico, sarei inoltre interessato a comprendere meglio i meccanismi sin da ora solo ipotizzati per ciascun fondatore per sostenere economicamente ed operativamente l'avvio ed il consolidamento di OpenVillage.\n\nImmaginando che tutto ci\u00f2 sia gi\u00e0 stato discusso nella videochat, sarebbe interessante accedere alle registrazioni Hangout in modo da garantire un allineamento informativo in merito ai progressi ed alla programmazione da parte di tutti.

There is a story to go with it. The post is long, but mostly pictures. You can reproduce the steps yourself by using <a href=\"http://164.132.58.138:9000\">the GraphRyder dashboard</a>. \n\nThe story: I am a senior-level decision maker, maybe the minister of health or something. I am examining the output of the collective intelligence process in interactive form. I need to use interaction to make sense of it: reading the whole corpus is out of the question. Even reading the report is quite unlikely.\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>I call up the co-occurrences graph. Too messy! Unreadable. \n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e57dd6d31cd0c912e14bba9f2632f69cb21c4052.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"406\">\n</li>\n\n<li>I filter down (k = 6). Now I have a clear picture: the main conversation is divided into 2 groups of codes. A smaller one is clustered around \"mental health\", and it is connected to a larger one, clustered around <code class=\"content-output\">legality</code>, <code class=\"content-output\">community based care</code>, <code class=\"content-output\">resource strain</code> and <code class=\"content-output\">migration</code>. I am ignoring <code class=\"content-output\">case study</code> and <code class=\"content-output\">research question</code> because they are non-semantic markers. The story here is this: community-based care is a set of solutions that the community sees most connected to two large care issues, <code class=\"content-output\">mental health</code> and <code class=\"content-output\">migration</code>. <code class=\"content-output\">Resource strain</code> and <code class=\"content-output\">legality</code> might be interpreted as conditioning factors relevant to deploying those solutions.</li>\n\n<li>I (the minister) am looking for technological solutions. So, I notice <code class=\"content-output\">existing systems failure</code> in the graph and I decide to look around it: hopefully somebody will have suggested solutions for systems failure. I open the ego network view of the code co-occurrences graph and center it on <code class=\"content-output\">existing systems failure</code>. Again: too many connections. \n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/33e7826ebd314e60790020a2c908082bb5548634.jpg\" width=\"555\" height=\"500\">\n</li>\n\n<li>I filter all the way up: the single strongest edge remaining connects \"existing systems failure\" to \"legality\" (k = 8). I start filtering back down in search of technological solutions. When I am down to k=3, \"care networks\" appears. \n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/acd5cd8063b5c6a1d1eded77bc75fa75654a1a3d.jpg\" width=\"557\" height=\"500\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/d/d145a5ec09ade14b4da3f66fc8d212d15fc94898.jpg\" width=\"561\" height=\"500\">\n</li>\n\n<li>This looks promising, so I click on the <code class=\"content-output\">care networks</code> code and get access to all the content (9 posts, 6 comments) that encode it. This allows me to learn how the community thinks about this thing called <code class=\"content-output\">care networks</code>. \n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/701bc613d4ad2af2338e7ad6c45d0c759e4892ec.jpg\" width=\"539\" height=\"500\">\n</li>\n\n<li>But now I actually got curious about this very strong connection with legality. What is the nexus between systems failure and legality in the context of care? I can click on the edge between <code class=\"content-output\">existing systems failure</code> and <code class=\"content-output\">legality</code> to ask the community how it sees that connection play out. This gives me access to the 8 contributions associated to both codes. I do not even have to read the full content: titles like \"Mortal issues for humans helping out\", \"No humane ghost in the machine\", \"Health Autonomy Center\" and \"Greece's shadow zero-cash health care system\" tell me that sometimes the legal system is an obstacle for communities trying to solve care problems. There are problems with over-regulation, and now I understand that even though I might have a genius idea for an Open Source technology that will fix the problem of not being able to see my son's insulin levels, I will have other barriers to get through. Good to know--- I will certainly do research on how to bypass this. It turns out it is a major leitmotiv of the OpenCare research, as @Lakomaa can explain. </li>\n\n<li>So now I decide to explore \"legality\" itself. It is a highly connected code. \n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9d740e87f69faa1701b1ed4d7987b9245ae78947.jpg\" width=\"556\" height=\"500\">\n\n I filter back up again, then gradually down. At k=8 I see \"regulation\". At k=7 \"safety\" appears, also connected to \"regulation\". It seems that perhaps legality isn't just an obstacle, but brings up important considerations for me when I'm trying to make my technology. Let me research legal barriers, but let me also research what kinds of protections are in place for existing users of (failing) systems, so that I might not throw the baby out with the bathwater --- so I can keep the good stuff, the safeguards (which, I now recall, are often the concerns people raise about Open Source) while getting around the obstructive regulation. \n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c12a800dd62d36a59232a55f9e4b0953c9b89208.jpg\" width=\"576\" height=\"500\">\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nNow I have a top-level view of the problem; also, I have been able to zoom in onto a subset of it that is particularly actionalble for me. This knowleds was co-produced by myself (I was the one doing the driving of the dashboard) and the collective intelligence oif the community. None of this came from one person---- it came from an extended conversation and debate over a number of threads! \u200b \n\nWorks? @melancon | @Noemi | @Federico_Monaco", "created_at": "2017-03-06 21:42:14", "updated_at": "2019-08-24 11:24:58.366217", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 929, "wiki": false, "reads": 26, "score": 275.2, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3310, 5, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 813, "user_id": 3340, "topic_id": 780, "post_number": 1, "raw": "THE OPTIONS EXPRESSED IN THIS PAGE ARE ENGAGING ONLY THE AUTHOR. The Malagasy people seem to have lost the desire to resist standing up to defend their rights, even though they are being trampled on a daily basis. According to statistics, 92% of Malagasy lived below the poverty threshold but no one rose up. When social pressure is too much, the point of rupture is not far, and the accumulation of frustration and deprivation often results in bloody explosions. However, this can be avoided. Just put yourself to nonviolent civil resistance! Nowadays, the Malagasy people are tired of going down to the streets to claim their rights as citizens. Why make the strike if it is to have each time the same scenario: Teaser bombs, lost bullets and blood flowing, as was the case in 1972, 2002, or in 2009? Why manifesting because it is the politicians who benefit in the end? Today, people prefer to stay at home and rant about the social network instead of expressing their frustration in public and questioning their leaders. And yet, it is not the subjects of contestation which are wanting. Traffics of all kinds, corruption, bad governance, lack of accountability of elected officials, non-respect of laws, hamper development of the country. It is now essential that the Malagasy rediscover that power belongs to them and that they learn how to fight against injustice, without dilatory maneuvering of the politicians, and without violence. As Martin Luther King Jr pointed out, active nonviolence is not a method for cowards. On the contrary, it is a real resistance. It is the art of using non-violent power to achieve sociopolitical objectives, especially through symbolic protests. This practice was popularized from 1921 by exemplary personalities like Gandhi in India, by Nelson Mandela and Steve Biko in South Africa, or Martin Luther King Jr in his fight against segregation. The Malagasy also experimented with nonviolent civil resistance, for example through publications in satirical journals under colonization, but the practice gradually lost face to the rise of the military and police repression, but Also facing the weariness of the main concerned - the citizens. Contemporary movements such as Wake-up Madagascar are now trying to awaken citizens' consciences and to revive non-violent civil resistance. Short-lived symbolic actions that do not create crowds and are therefore not illegal are regularly organized to denounce the fact of society that make jasper. Expose empty plates to say that the Malagasy are hungry, to walk in the streets of Antananarivo to demand the ratification of a charter on democracy or to make the dead on the place of independence in the city center of the capital to denounce the words which undermine the country are for example, part of the non-violent civil resistance. It is precisely to spread this philosophy on the desire for change through non-violent actions that many projects such as LIANA or Learning Initiative Aiming at Non Violent Action which was initiated by Wake Up Madagascar, Liberty 32 and the WYLD program Women and Youth's League for Democracy with the support of the International Center for Non-Violent Conflict. Since the 70's during the 1st Republic in Madagascar, Malagasy people have been manipulate and influenced by politicians who wants a place on government by force.

No rest for the wicked, it seems! While this is good news, we need to allocate some bandwidth to it in order to take full advantage of it.</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>It all starts with Riccardo Luna, the highest-profile journalist covering innovation in Italy. He was the first chief editor of Wired Italia (which was a big success); he is now covering innovation on Repubblica \u2013 more or less the Italian equivalent of the Guardian, as well as being the chief editor of CheFuturo . Riccardo runs for Repubblica something called\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.repubblica.it/la-repubblica-delle-idee/\" target=\"_blank\">Next - La Repubblica delle idee</a>: it's a sort of TED-like event that aims to open windows on future-building stuff. This event is televised and streamed through the home pages of the highest-traffic websites in the country.\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>Paolo negotiated that one of this year's events is run from Matera on April 11th. Riccardo called me to tell me that he reserved a slot for the unMonastery; this slot could also be much longer than the others; 10 or 15 minutes instead of the standard 3 to 5. This is a great opportunity because it generates a high quality video that we can re-use to show people what the unMonastery is and convey its magic and sense of urgency.\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>Riccardo asked me to run this, acting as narrator/MC, but he is flexible on the format. I promised to think about it and come up with a proposal. The context \u2013 constraints and affordances \u2013 are as follows:</div>\n\n<div>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Italian language. We have to use it.</li>\n\n<li>Big stage. The event is run off a theatre, so there is a large stage. This does not need to be a TED style one-person show, though it can be. We can bring people and artefacts.</li>\n\n<li>Megascreen. It's there \u2013 we can use it or not.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n\n<div>To these constraints I am going to add one more: I am putting this opportunity out here so we all can collaborate to make something beautiful, but I am claiming last word on it. It is a benevolent dictatorship, not a democracy. This is based on competence: as a regular at Riccardo's events, I know what works (and what works not) in that space probably better than most of us. It is also based on responsibility: the invitation was made to me personally, and I have no choice but to accept it and bring on stage something that I am proud of, or refuse and distance myself publicly from whatever happens, good or bad.\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>I already know I don't want to focus on the unMonastery's internal process, but on the social dynamics that generated it and with which it interacts. So I want to give adequate visibility to the Edgeryders community as its forerunner and \"parent\", to MT2019 as its partner and local enabler, and to the things large and small that unMonasterians are cooking up with Materans.</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>The fallback position is a TED-style presentation with nice slides. But I am sure we can do better. Riccardo, easily the best communicator I know, told me something interesting: he said \"The point of engaging in an exercise like this is to communicate something very well\" and \"I recommend you make the unMonastery pop\". He clearly thinks we can break into mainstream level.</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>Here's what I would like you to do:</div>\n\n<div>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>decide whether you want to participate in making this artefact, the unMonastery presentation at Next. This entails signing off to the above.</li>\n\n<li>if you do, work with me, from concept to delivery. We start with the concept: the fallback position \u2013 if you all disengage \u2013 is a TED style presentation by me, but I am sure we can do better. For example, I would like to physically show people and things, conveying the idea of the unMonastery as a space for interesting people and their artefacts.</li>\n\n<li>once we agree on a concept and high-level scripting, we will iron out the details and produce materials as needed.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n</div>\n\n<div>With [Ben], [Nadia] and any willing unMonasterians we now turn to do this together.\u00a0</div>", "created_at": "2014-03-21 20:02:25", "updated_at": "2018-06-01 08:40:11.963875", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 764, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 20.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2817, "user_id": 1877, "topic_id": 2784, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hey Edgeryders!\n\n<span>We are here to call for support for something we care about: <strong>to inspire<span> Armenians</span> to find the work they really love!</strong></span>\n\n<span>We recognise that unfortunately not many here have the privilege to be able to choose the job they like.

Here's my take on it. I have followed Vinay's work from afar and found it bold and provocative. Reading this brief about how he currently lives and what got him to this point was particularly instructive for me: Currently a PhD student in anthropology, whether I will one day be employable and what for is an important issue I have to deal with. At the same time, I am currently trying with a few friends to get a contract from the local territorial planning agency to influence future public policy and how it impacts the Shuar, a native Amazonian people who has been dealing with heavy colonization for a century. Right now, teaching and free-lance consulting are the two main possibilities for employment that I see for me in the near future. What can Vinay's experience teach me, then?\n\n1- Self-employment is not the answer\n\nVinay says that he came to realize employment was a problem, but that self-employment did not solve it. Having a boss telling you what to do is bad enough, but having to be that boss yourself is even worse: You work more without necessarily getting more stuff done, and you end up exhausted. That's also the big discovery of pretty much any PhD student: You have freedom to do what you want, sure, but you also never stop working and end up internalizing all sorts of criticism: You become an obsessional paranoid. The paid acadmic life doesn't seem a whole lot better: A big chunk of your time is spent doing admin work, and are continuously frustrated by how you are made to teach and how little use your students will ever make of it. You get paid enough to pretend you don't care about wordly stuff, but end up fetishizing books, betting on the stock-market, and wanting the latest iPad, just like everyone else. But man can you quote Marx and Zizek! Clearly, that's not the best of plans for me, I might as well get an office job and really be like everyone else. But the free-lance stuff is not better, it leads you to participate in the very things you'd like to fight (helping oil companies get an ethical image, helping UNESCO transform people's lives into museums).\n\n\u00a0\n\n2- Chosen poverty, the tough path\n\nVinay then chose to refuse to get paid for something he would not do for free. That's a pretty paradoxical statement, especially if you believe, like most economists, that people get paid to compensate for the waste of time their job is. It also does mean\u00a0 that you don't get paid a lot. On the one hand, it looks like a radical version of self-employment: I'm my own boss, and on top of that I'm a picky boss. But it is also a radical reversal of that: Work is not anymore evaluated in relation to freedom/leisure time, and payment does not compensate for the loss of time. Instead, work is a gift, and payment is a counter-gift. I find it important to note that this choice comes and i sustained not only by political ideals, but also by a series of spiritual practice, from meditation to psychotherapy. I know too many friends who've slipped i nto depression once university was over because their political ideals forbid them to accept most forms of employment whilst they still wanted a decent place to live in, a tv to watch, and all sorts of luxuries. The guilt created by their inability to live up to their dreams made their life even more difficult. In my experience, meditation and psychotherapy don't make you feel good so that you can bypass the need for material stuff, they make you see the traps you get yourself into and help you not fall into them, one of these traps being desire. So that encourages me in my current practices. Let's see his 4 more specific tricks:\n\na- Minimizing needs helps maximising freedom: The sort of freedom he talks about here is very different from the classical economics understanding of freedom. Minimizing needs is what allows you to not need a job and focus on what you think is right. And, for me at least, meditation and psychotherapy look like some of the best ways to get to that point.\n\nb- Speculate: I'm less sure about that one, especially the betting on technology part, but I imagine it comes from Vinay's brand of work, the construction of cheap and easy infrastructures to deal with catastrophes. I do know that I enjoy science fiction a lot because it helps reveal latent tendencies in the present world and trains the imagination into seeing other possible presents and futures. Continuing to focus on that, on keeping open many options for the future and looking at big trends rather than focusing on daily news, that's my take on Vinay's second trick.\n\nc- Deliver: Working without a boss means you're more vulnerable, and doing that with principles means you need every job you can get in what you'll accept to do. Because you cannot rely on institutions, you need to rely on networks, and that doesn't mean \"networking\" and twittering like crazy, it means being yourself a reliable part of the network. Getting the job done and being realistic about what job you can do, how well and in what amount of time are crucial here. That's the hard stuff, because that means being very realistic about one's capacities and failings. I imagine that's also the reason why the \"productivity\" and \"networking\" industries work so well, because insecurity leads a lot of people to try to fake it. Again, meditation and psychotherapy should help with getting real, not with the becoming perfect part that a lot of people aim for. And I know this is a difficult part for me, I tend to deliver just on time, or a little late, but products of a far lower quality than I could because of anxiety-fueled procrastination. So that's where I need to work.\n\nd- Give: Because, once again, a radical free-lancer like Vinay cannot rely on the stability of institutions, he must rely on his friends. The capitalist model would ask you to save money, or even invest it, so that you can even out the accidents of life. Vinay's experience points, once again, towards Potlatch: Give to your friends when you have money, and hope that they'll help you out when you are in need. This is not careless generosity though: Give to the friends who you know value friendship. SOme don't and value family more, and that's fine with them, but that means they won't be as likely to help you out. Like the previous one, that sounds like a very good, and a very difficult advice. I imagine that that's because I've lived all my life in one institution or another, and my friendships have mainly been very abstract ones that do not involve money or working for one another.\u00a0 But I'll keep my eyes open for that in the future.\n\nAll in all, Vinay's statement is both inspirational and tough on the ego. It tells me that I could actually live the good life, but that I should get a grip, and that it won't be easy on \"me\". Unlike the monks who retreat from the world on top of a mountain, Vinay chose to live in the midst of it all and at the same time to offer himself as an example of how one can livedifferently in this world. The alternative he gives is not utopian, and the criticism he offers to capitalism are not those of a \"good soul\": they come from the practical experience of another way of life folded inside this. That's as inspirational as it gets for me!\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2011-12-12 19:29:56", "updated_at": "2017-09-21 13:32:48.197523", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1399, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25071, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 1772, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Oooh awesome!</b>\n\nSam, thanks for suggesting this, personally I'm jumping through the roof as I would soo very much enjoy a session like this. we can do it in the track of <a href=\"/t/making-lote3/360/lote-organizational-architecture-a-proposal\">Upskilling (not sure you;ve been following how we intend to structure Lote)</a>.

I felt NGOs just worked to get grants, rather than working on what they once were founded for, loosing their initial goals and aims out of sight. After that I worked at the European and Dutch parliament, and a similar feeling creeped over me: reading boring reports, trying to write up an advice, but not feeling actual change occurred.\u00a0\n\nI continued writing my blog, picked up some journalism gigs and studied russian in Ukraine, after which i decided to go for an MA degree in politics in Sweden. I kept on writing, but still didn't know what it actually achieved. And after finishing my MA I realized how closely knit the media environment is and how uninterested they media was in covering the Caucasus, my area of expertise. It was frustrating.\u00a0\n\nAlso graduating at a time when the economic crisis had hit the hardest, I was - as many of my generation - a bit lost. I worked hard to become a professional for 10 years, but a professional in what? Not only where there no jobs out there, I also felt uncomfortable working again in a civil society that just applied for grants to stay alive, working in politics hadn't worked either for me, and the media gigs I got were so minor I couldn't survive on it.\u00a0\n\nI started teaching English. But after one and a half year I realized that if I wouldn't quit, I would get stuck in teaching. Although it did give me some fulfillment, as I was actually working with youth and could see change in them, it was not something I wanted to do my whole life, the impact seemed to small. So I quit. With only one small freelance gig to go on.\u00a0\n\nHowever, it was the best decision of my life. A few months later, after doing minor freelance gigs and teaching private students, Edgeryders was introduced to my life, and by that I mean: alternative ways to change the communities around you.\u00a0\n\nYesterday I organized the first georgia futterspotters meeting after the conference, and I was sure it would be a really small group: I was wrong. Every other person that came in put a smile on my face: six months of working with Edgeryders had actually made some impact, people were willing to sit down together and discus issues, come up with new ideas, and as Khatuna put it \"trying to find a way to get these talks turn into real actions\".\u00a0\n\nThe Futurespotters conference was great in a sense that it brought inspiration, at least for me. To see all these people from different places do different things, not to make money, but to make a change.\u00a0\n\nPersonally for me, it would've been better if - besides the final report - some \u00a0more concrete actions would've been crystalized during the conference. However, after the meet-up yesterday, I am certain that for georgia good things will happen.\u00a0\n\nMy story is a very interpersonal story, I am aware of it. However, I felt the need to share my own journey. Through edgeryders I have gotten three new clients that all work with passion, who are not grant eaters. Who want to take a new approach. Their enthusiasm ignites enthusiasm within me. And through edgeryders I have realized that, as Nika from Guerrilla Gardening said it: \"the government is the child and society its parent, the parent has to tell the child what goes well and what goes wrong.\"\n\n", "created_at": "2014-07-19 04:27:40", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:18.616795", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 645, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1006, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 973, "post_number": 1, "raw": "The Cooperation Commons is an interdisciplinary study of cooperation and collective action.

Starting from the second half of the 20th century, developed countries switched to systems where the care providers were professionals, working for the government and modern corporations.\n\nThis new solution has achieved brilliant results, based on the deployment of scientific knowledge and technology.<strong>\u00a0</strong>However, over the past 20 years it has come under growing strain: the demand for professional care (health care, social care, daycare for children, care for elderly people\u2026) seems limitless, but the resources our economies allocate to it clearly are not. Additionally, any attempt to rationalise the system and squeeze some extra productivity out of it seems to dehumanise people in need of care, who get treated as batches in a manufacturing process.\n\n<strong>What if we could come up with a system that combines the access to modern science and technology of state- and private sector-provided care to the low overhead and human touch of community-provided care?</strong>\n\nWe are attempting to do just that. Meet the OpenCarers will showcare the results of OpenCare, a two-year, 1.6 million euro research project to design and prototype new care services. \u00a0By the end of this project we will have:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>collected experiences of community-driven care services</li>\n\n<li>validated them through open discussion, both online and offline.</li>\n\n<li>augmented them with state-of-the-art maker technology (3D printing, laser cutting, biohacking\u2026)</li>\n\n<li>combined everything we learn into the design and prototype of next generation community-driven care services.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThis is way too ambitious for us to do alone, so we are doing it with everybody, leveraging collective intelligence. The whole process is \u2013 and will stay \u2013 open to anyone who wants to participate. We operate under a social contract to acknowledge each and every contribution; we do not make participants into a crowd of rightless volunteers.\n\n<strong>Care is deeply human. Everyone has\u00a0</strong><strong>first hand</strong><strong>\u00a0experience of it. Even those of us who are not doctors or nurses or caregivers are occasionally patients (even doctors!); we all have first-hand experience of giving and\u00a0</strong><strong>recieving</strong><strong>\u00a0care. So, everyone is welcome to join the conversation and the subsequent\u00a0</strong><strong>prototypes.</strong>\n\nIn Meet The OpenCarers, a track within the OpenVillage Festival, we will:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Participate in community care-related talks, debates, workshops &amp; business development</li>\n\n<li>Explore new technologies, methodologies &amp; collaboration opportunities in community care</li>\n\n<li>Discover innovative new technologies, products and services in the exhibition.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>To get a ticket to this part of the OpenVillage Festival is easy:</strong>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Create an account on edgeryders.eu</li>\n\n<li>Read 3 conversations about how others are innovating in care &amp; leave thoughtful comments\u00a0<a href=\"/all-responses\">here</a>\n</li>\n\n<li>Submit a proposal for a session, or tell others about your experiences of giving and receiving care.\u00a0Share this\u00a0as\u00a0a story\u00a0<a href=\"/node/6146\">here</a>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<h2>\u00a0</h2>\n\n<h2>Partner organisations</h2>\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c42df3dd45f23cced18fc0ddc2e5bfac811942cf.PNG\" width=\"690\" height=\"71\">\n\nThis track of the OpenVillage has received funding from the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 688670\n\n<img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://opencare.cc/assets/OC-EC-H2020.jpg\" width=\"50%\">\n\n<section>\u00a0</section>\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-04-11 08:40:25", "updated_at": "2017-09-19 14:58:35.071524", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 818, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 1.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9069, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1275, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>What do you mean \"no breakdown\"?</b>\n\nBridget, I don't know you, but it may just be you are an unassuming person. Leaving a management job at a prestigious cultural institution to start a company (!) to consult for good ethical business (!!) in culture (!!!) would look like a triple breakdown to many people in this little space.\n\nWhich is oddly common - and this commonality is very refreshing in itself, because it points to a view of European youth as busy tackling some very large societal problems instead of sitting back and complaining about the government (though they do that too, and rightly). This may be obvious to many people here, but as a temp Eurocrat I can assure you that it is NOT the way most policy makers see it. When they look at young people, they see mostly problems: unemployed, undercapitalized, lazy, selfish, violent, dangerous. As they struggle for a solution, they look everywhere except to the people already blazing trails. Here we try to build a safe space for policy makers and trailblazers to interact respectfully. I guess this would win us honorary membership of the League of Pragmatic Optimists (you lot seem to have a knack for great names)... except our pragmatism has not been recognized yet. We'll see.\n\nMeanwhile, as I read your story I find it very clear that you are almost a one-woman Edgeryders.

I am looking forward to know more about your experience in these areas. \u00a0I am curious: what kind of background produces someone like you? You mention, in passing, being from \"the greenest family in Norfolk\". What does this mean? Were your parents famous ecologists or environmentalists?

The ethos is if you are interested in something, want to see something improved, or feel something is missing... get involved. In Edgeryders nothing happens till you say \"I would like to do x\" :)\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">The big picture: What we agreed on</h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">1. A key aim of Edgeryders is to facilitate and encourage mutual support between community members and collaboration on projects.</h3>\n\nSo over the next year we are going to focus energy on\n\n<strong>A. Harmonious Hackathons:</strong> making them happen on a regular basis (several times a year) and making them an economically sustainable line of activity (ensure people organising them are paid). We would do a number of themes one of which could be \\#HackCare continuing on <a href=\"/t/notes-from-the-lote4-session-on-the-future-of-care-in-the-hands-of-hackers/3920\">foundation set at lote4</a> by <a href=\"/u/remy\">@R\u00e9my</a>, <a href=\"/u/ben\">@Ben</a> and everyone who participated.\u00a0<a href=\"http://edgeryders.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2426561089e1f5ab32da252cd&amp;id=859867d716&amp;e=a971924c53\" target=\"_blank\">Interested?</a>\n\n<strong>B.\u00a0Building an Edgeryders home base.\u00a0</strong>We also agreed that we need \"our own\" space to run events regularly,\u00a0as hackathons need weeks rather than days to \"complete\" work. This will make it easier to\u00a0keep money and time costs at an acceptable level.\u00a0\n\n<strong>C. Edgeryders.eu/ Makerfox integration:</strong> the experiment with using barter to build \\#lote4 using makerfox produced promising results. In order for us to use it for more activities the integration with Edgeryders needs to be smoother, so we need to specify what needs to be done and find resources to cover the cost of the work. Ping<strong> </strong><a href=\"/u/matthias\">@Matthias</a> in the <a href=\"/en/makerfox\">Makerfox project</a> if you want to help..\n\n<strong>D. Building stronger community ties:</strong> We aim to grow the number, thickness and quality of Edgeryders community members social ties with each other, members of other communities and networks and with members of organisations with resources and need for their skills/projects.\n\n<strong>We will do this online </strong>with regularly updated content like <a href=\"/en/blog/get-back-in-the-box\">Get Back in the Box!</a> and the <a href=\"/t/making-space/3896\">Making Space</a> series curated by <a href=\"/u/anon\">@Bezdomny</a>. If you enjoy writing and editing for the web, please do step forward- we're trying to build editorial team to create something interesting and economically sustainable together.\u00a0\n\n<strong>When I organise/ participate in physical meetings</strong>, I commit to ensure they are properly documented here on the platform so as not to fragment the community or exclude others from the conversations. If you can do the same it would be much appreciated.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">2. The unMonastery prototype was successful and we want to continue developing the existing site and set up new ones.</h3>\n\nThe unMonastery was again a highlight of Lote4, with\u00a0<a href=\"http://edgeryders.us2.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=2426561089e1f5ab32da252cd&amp;id=99f782a23c&amp;e=a971924c53\" target=\"_blank\">a</a>\u00a0<a href=\"http://edgeryders.us2.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=2426561089e1f5ab32da252cd&amp;id=e0243ee650&amp;e=a971924c53\" target=\"_blank\">lot\u00a0</a>of\u00a0<a href=\"http://edgeryders.us2.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=2426561089e1f5ab32da252cd&amp;id=e5603396f7&amp;e=a971924c53\" target=\"_blank\">reflections</a>.\u00a0It was agreed that the time is not mature for setting up a separate unMonastery organisation and that Edgeryders LBG should continue to be the \"home organisation\" for the unMonastery project.\n\n<strong>A. Continued presence in the Palazzo Casale complex:</strong>\u00a0 We agreed that the next step would be to produce a credible plan for running the space including revenue streams/fundraising activities in order to present to the Committato Matera2019 before they are dissolved (i.e. before end of the working year). For those interested,<strong> </strong><a href=\"/u/mariabyck\">@mariabyck</a>, <a href=\"/u/katalin\">@katalin</a>, <a href=\"/u/nicobis\">@NicoBis</a> and <a href=\"/u/ritao\">@RitaO</a> are exploring this.\n\n<strong>B. New possible unMonastery sites:</strong> Edgeryders LBG has been approached by with two requests for new development projects which could involve setting up new unMonastery sites. After discussing the matter with community members in the room one proposal was sent off to Fabrizio Barca.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">3. We would like to experiment with different formats for community events</h3>\n\nLote4 was\u00a0generative at many levels\u00a0<a href=\"http://edgeryders.us2.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=2426561089e1f5ab32da252cd&amp;id=f52c055417&amp;e=a971924c53\" target=\"_blank\">(documentation is available</a>), yet it\u00a0is an annual sprint of 3 months with over 50 community members collaborating on it and there's some risk of burnout in the core team. The question is can we look for lighter\u00a0event formats and teams to drive them?\n\nProposals ranged from piggybacking existing events\u00a0and making ourselves visible as \"Edgeryders\";\u00a0to making them more harmonious hackathon focused;\u00a0to doing a walking format (a long trek and people host conversations while walking or during breaks). The key thing being that whatever the format it has to not exclude people with disabilities if they want to join, and honour the commitment to great documentation.\n\nWe have started participating in events where we can support others, and draw support for community members work.

Jimmy, an element seems to be missing from your analysis: <em>what it is </em>we are trying to exchange. This is not a matter of taste or ideology. We have established markets work really well for private goods with no externalities \u2013 say, potatoes. Not much debate there. However, they don't work as well for collective goods, or private goods with externalities \u2013 say, clean air or the continued existence of the Welsh language. More debate here, but I am hoping the \"Einstein test\" (only a fool keeps doing the same thing expecting different results) is enough to at least agree that <em>in practice</em> markets that do not work on their own cannot be made to work.\n\nThere are other two interesting things that I think merit consideration:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Markets do have an ethical value. In most of the philosophical literature I know of, that value is overwhelmingly positive. John Stuart Mill <a href=\"http://www.econlib.org/library/Mill/mlP46.html\">thought</a> commerce to be \"the great permanent security for the uninterrupted progress of the ideas, the institutions, and the character of the human race\" and that it would \"rapidly render war obsolete, by strengthening and multiplying the personal interests which are in natural opposition to it\". Graeber agrees, and raves about the civility of the muslim trading cities of the Indian Ocean pre-Reconquista. He also adds an interesting spin: in those cities, what passed for the state (armed desert bedouins who mistrusted city life and culture) refused to enforce contracts. If your business partner screws you over, that's your problem, you are on your own. This ended up fostering a climate in which reputation capital was very important, and commerce never led to violence, public or private.  Now that we have translated <a href=\"/t/selling-out-is-a-misnomer-how-communities-are-transformed-from-making-the-sale/4068\">his masterful piece on merchant communities</a>, I would love to have the opinion of @lasindias on this.</li>\n\n<li>However, market logic tends to \"bleed\" out of its original context. Graeber (again) has a very interesting story about the Nuer, a tribe of pastoralists originally from Southern Ethiopia (coincidentally, I am in Addis Ababa as I write this and I see the occasional Nuer on the streets \u2013 they are hard to miss, very tall and almost black-skinned, many Ethiopian models tend to be Nuer). The Nuer, as many African tribes, had a currency that was <em>not</em> used to buy everyday things, but only offered as compensation for what can never be fully compensated: human life, specifically the life of young women of fertile age. The idea is: you can't buy a bride, if you marry my sister you have to offer me yours. But then, market logic kicks in: suppose I don't like your sister, or she is three years old. What happens then? You give me some copper rods, symbolizing the debt of one young woman your clan has with respect to mine. I can then go to your second cousin and reclaim <em>his</em> sister. But then what happens is: someone becomes economically successful in \"normal\" goods, and accepts payment from a struggling partner in copper rods. At this point, the crafty businessman owns a woman from a clan without having to give one. Fast forwards ten generations, add European- and Arab-led slave trade to Africa and \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 you get a full fledged market for human lives. Some stewardship! Graeber's argument is complex, and my stickman rendition does not do it justice. But it did leave me wary of applying market logic to anything that is not a private good, no externalities.</li>\n\n</ol>", "created_at": "2015-01-30 13:13:00", "updated_at": "2018-03-03 07:30:24.436751", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 631, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 11.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [30743], "is_liked_by": [1012], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11120, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 3649, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Invitation text missing the engagement offer</b>\n\nHi Riel,\n\nMy reasoning around your comment is\u00a0 the kind of persuasion you want participants to experience is something that happens as the result of a longer learning process.

I do not understand everything, though. In particular, I would be interested to knowing the answer\u00a0that\u00a0the panel gave to the title question. Some people said \u00a0\"private sector\" (Mango, Galliano). Some people are saying \"makerspaces/fablabs\" ( @Costantino ). Saying \"everyone\" is not good enough \u2013 too vague. Generically naming \"civil society\" is also too vague. We are all (or at least we claim to be)\u00a0civil society, from established NGOs to hackerspaces. Heck, the Cooperativa 29 Giugno claimed the same, until Mafia Capitale came to the light.\n\nThe idea behind opencare, as I understand it, is to go beyond methodological individualism, and say that the agent of care is a community. A community is not \"a thing\", defined by its legal status. It is an emergent property of the patterns of collaboration, sharing and exchanging of many individuals. So, to address @Ezio_Manzini 's highly relevant question,\u00a0the \"open\" in opencare has to be in the how: how this cooperation actually happens.\u00a0\n\nIn communities of makers, as we discussed many timnes with Costantino, it would work by blurring the line between care provider and care recipient. People would have skills and needs, and they, collectively, would \"balance the books\". An experienced maker is better at building, but a person with a disability is a better designer if the solution has to serve her personally.\u00a0Additionally \u2013 and critically \u2013 the ethics of the maker movement is that people can be makers\u00a0<em>in part:</em>\u00a0I can do some simple things, and need help for the difficult ones. You can write Arduino code, but someone else has to build. She is actually a good maker, but she specializes in electric stuff, and nees\u00a0help for the hydraulics. In this way, a community pooling its skills can take advantage also of small lumps of works, just like it happens in Wikipedia.\u00a0\n\nAny thoughts on that?\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-10-20 19:30:11", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:40.145527", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 344, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 54, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 38, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2017-07-08 23:46:14.761916", "updated_at": "2017-07-08 23:46:14.761916", "deleted_at": "2017-07-09 23:00:33.476567", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13615, "user_id": 1547, "topic_id": 1976, "post_number": 6, "raw": "That's me, I was the one calling Fabio.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-10-01 16:00:37", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:16.951429", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 11, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [6909], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16771, "user_id": 82, "topic_id": 3048, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Access denied, did it move?\n\n", "created_at": "2014-06-30 18:36:52", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:33.826367", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 7, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5772, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5739, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Our <a href=\"/t/the-opencare-engagement-strategy-at-a-glance/5545\">engagement strategy</a> has been in part \u2013 at least temporarily \u2013 modified by a decision of the Stockholm consortium meeting, as we wait for answers to some administrative questions. As far as I know, the fall will be characterized by a focus on\u00a0events organized by almost all opencare\u00a0partners.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">Focus in the fall: offline events</h3>\n\nPlease remember that events should produce data. What constitutes good\u00a0data for opencare is outlined in our <a href=\"/t/revise-and-ok-the-data-management-plan/5701\">data strategy</a> \u2013 we have already submitted its first version to the EC. Slides 10-11 describe an ideal case and suggest mitigation measures in case the situation is not ideal. I stand ready to discuss with you any situation not contemplated by the data strategy.\u00a0\n\n<strong>Edgeryders</strong> will be organizing three events, all in collaboration with Opencare fellows (people we have already engaged). Fellows will tap into their networks to draw in more practitioners. Each event will specialize in an area that seems to be \"hot\", as demonstrated by the presence of several interesting initiatives working on it. Dates and themes below are subject to variations. At a later date we will announce a partnership with a local open care initiative in each city.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Brussels, 10-11 September. This event will focus on intergenerational care (pensioners living with students etc.)</li>\n\n<li>Berlin, 17-18 September. This event will be dedicated to \"Caring for carers\": support systems that prevent burnout and help community carers to keep doing their work sustainably.</li>\n\n<li>Thessaloniki, 24-25\u00a0September. This event focus on\u00a0nutrition, and specifically DIY/community ways to produce healthy, cheap food.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nTo make participation more attractive, Nadia has come up with a great idea: we come together to build a decentralized proposal to be submitted to an initiative called <a href=\"https://www.100andchange.org/\">100 and change</a>. In order to do that, however, we need to gather information about the existing initiatives of open care on the ground, which is exactly what the opencare project needs to do. The final details of the process are still being worked out, but I think it is a solid idea. We are shooting for 50 new challenge responses and 150 new comments.\n\n<strong>UBx</strong> will be involved in <a href=\"http://hackinghealth.ca/fr/event/hhbordeaux-fr/\">Hacking Health Bordeaux</a>, 21-23 October. @melancon , any instructions on how to participate? Do we need to pay the ticket, and is it only for the hackathon or for the conference too? Any thoughts?\n\n<strong>ScImpulse</strong> is preparing an event in Geneva at\u00a0CERN. There does not seem to be a date yet (<a href=\"http://scimpulse.blogspot.be/2016/07/the-call-to-hack-open-care-system.html\">ScImpulse blog</a>).\u00a0\n\n<strong>WeMake</strong> and the <strong>City of Milano</strong>, I think, will continue with their event program. @Costantino is working on a calendar.\u00a0\n\nSo, this is not so bad. We are looking at 6-7 events in 6 countries. Of course we maintain a common opencare calendar, to make ti easier for people to engage with us offline, by attending the event nearest to them. Each partner will take charge of communicating her own event, as per the communication plan contained in the proposal. Good work everyone! Please keep us updated, by posting even short updates on the stuff you do.\u00a0\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">Other things you can do to help engagement</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Read and comment the challenge responses!

Before the explorer was categorized in this way, I was going in\u00a0chronological order (but sticking with challenge responses once they became codable, and coding posts with at least one comment).\n\nI don't partially code any posts, so if there is a comment in a coded post left untagged, it is because I did not find anything in the comment that I thought needed a tag assigned. With one notable exception of course ---- if the comment is more recent than when I tagged the post. (side note --- if we could create a notification system to let me know when posts I've already coded get a new comment, that would make for more thoroughness, but I understand our resources are not unlimited :) )\n\nI am happy to change the criterion if it would make for a better graph sooner --- I figured the more interactions I could code\u00a0(e.g. more comments) the more robust of a graph we would have. I can do a double limit (coding posts with the most comments in one particular challenge response category, for example).\u00a0The categories have overlapped a great deal however (lots of migration-related stories in categories other than people on the move!) and one category has far more responses than the others. Thoughts on how else to limt would be welcome.\u00a0\n\nAs for hierarchies, I am keeping a list but have not expressed the hierarchy in the taxonomy manager. That was my project for today, but I seem to have lost access to the manager (see screenshot below). Can someone return access to me? If so, I can formalise the hierarchies this weekend so they are visible to all. As well as merging/forking\u00a0some\u00a0overlapping codes that I have kept a running list of.

Unfortunately, it\u2019s more difficult that we think, because our brain does not like uncertainty and risks. It likes to imprison us in a \u201ccomfort zone\u201d.

Please feel free to join us next time! Below you wil find what happened this meeting.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo, I will shortly explain you what we talked about, what challenges we face, and what kind of help people in this community might need.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>What did we talk about?</strong>\n\nWe saw a lot of new faces, such as <a href=\"/u/vano\">@Vano</a>, who runs <a href=\"http://cac.org.ge/\">the DRR Center\u00a0</a>in Georgia. We also met Richard, who facilitates several different interest groups on facebook, such as the language exchange group and the Georgia Hiking group. And Remi, who has a company which brings foreign IT specialists to Ukraine and Georgia, where they keep on continuing their own work abroad, but at the same time contribute to their new communities sharing their skills and knowledge.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>Our talk started discussing the problem of the use of <strong>open source software</strong>. In Georgia, people mostly illegally download pricey software, only because they do not realize there is open sourced software out there which does exactly the same. Solutions talked about were mostly education based, perhaps we can think of a concrete action plan to make this happen?</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>A second issue which came up again (and again) was the <strong>competitiveness within the NGO world</strong>: how can we change this? We haven't come up with an actual solution, but any ideas are welcome! We understand civil society has become competitive, as all are competing for the same grants; however, people don't become active because they want money, they become active because they want to change their community! How can we make well established NGOs realize that by co-working with whomever is working in the same field, that the aim and goals they set to achieve, are actually easier to achieve together, rather than excluding everyone out of 'spite'? This is a well-known issue, raised often, but hard to solve. We need to create an action plan for this, perhaps there are some 'best-practices' out there people are willing to share?\u00a0</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>Our third topic at the beginning of the meeting regarded the <strong>FB group</strong> for georgia's Edgeryders and moving this to Edgeryders completely. Altough the group understood the importance of the edgeryders platform (<a href=\"/spot-the-future/why-we-dont-use-facebook-twitter-etc-in-spot-the\">this post</a> was read and mentioned), the general consensus was to keep the facebook group. I will ask the people posting in the group, friendly but urgently, to repost it in this group (link to it included). As FB is THE main communication channel in georgia, the group was afraid to loose the interaction if it would be completely removed. <span>Uli also mentioned he would not register on Edgeryders, as he spends already too much time online, but he will contribute to the physical meetings as he does believe in the project</span>.\u00a0</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>Projects</strong>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>\t\tRemi told us about a girl in<span> Gori</span> (a middle-sized town) <span>who would like to do a project on \u00a0<strong>prejudices of Georgians towards Ossetians</strong>. <span>Basically, do research on preceptions between ethnic groups in Georgia (in Gori).</span> She is currently looking for any help she could get in realizing this. Remi told us he will introduce her to Edgeryders, so she could share her story and get feedback. In response,\u00a0<a href=\"/u/khatuna\">@Khatuna</a>\u00a0mentioned that at the UN they are changing their research methodologies (please explain in the comments Khatuna!), something which this gril might benefit from.</span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<a href=\"/u/vano\">@Vano</a>\u00a0told us about several projects he would like to introduce to us. First of all the several <span><strong>youth groups</strong> they have set up in different regions. He was very surprised to see how active they were, organizing flash-mobs, asking funding from local municipalities, etc, to change their local communities. They need a platform where they can share information, Edgeryders could be perfect!</span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\tThe second project <a href=\"/u/vano\">@Vano</a>\u00a0mentioned were the<span>\u00a0<strong>Community Access Centers</strong>: training centers in IDP settlements. A few years back they started these with USAID/UN funding, and some local people were trained to give IT related workshops. The centers were open to everyone to use. However, in 2011 it was handed over to the local communities, unfortunately the centers were shut down right away. No-one took care of it, neither community nor local municipalities, and the centers were looted and damaged.<span> DRR center asked for ownership again and they got it. They repaired everything and are trying to bring back life to the centers again. They decided to have a local tv group, to show success stories</span>. <a href=\"/u/cristina_maza\">@Cristina_Maza</a>\u00a0right away mentioned that<span> Jumpstart is doing a project reporting on initiatives just like this! </span><span>Another thought that came up: how about creating an unMonastry in one of the communities</span>? Remi, who has a business which brings IT people to Georgia to experience life abroad, might also be able to help out once his project has been running for a while. Also,\u00a0<a href=\"/u/vano\">@Vano</a>\u00a0said he would share this himself online.</span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<a href=\"/u/inge\">@Inge</a>\u00a0took of her Edgeryders community-builder hat for a second to put on her IFLRY hat, asking if anyone would be able to help <span><span>creating a website and <strong>app to instantly monitor election fraud</strong> during Georgia's June elections</span>.\u00a0<a href=\"/u/khatuna\">@Khatuna</a>\u00a0<span>mentioned that Tamar Zhvania, of the chairperson of <a href=\"http://www.isfed.ge/main/447/eng/\">ISFED</a>, would probably very willing to help in any election related issues.\u00a0<a href=\"/u/cristina_maza\">@Cristina_Maza</a>\u00a0added that perhaps <span>Jumpstart </span>could help out as well. Richard showed the following app:\u00a0http://www.free-and-fair.org/. Uli mentioned a project from Germany, which he will share with us soon.</span>\u00a0</span>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nOur bi-weekly meet-up finished after this, as most of the participants wanted to go to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/289813194519016/?ref_dashboard_filter=upcoming\">Coop.ge's exhibition</a> on recycling and littering.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-25 16:48:56", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:15.619825", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1591, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 25.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4101, "user_id": 1012, "topic_id": 4068, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<em>(Translated from the <a href=\"http://lasindias.com/como-transforma-a-una-comunidad-salir-a-vender\">original Spanish text</a> by <a href=\"/u/alberto\">@Alberto</a> and <a href=\"/u/noemi\">@Noemi</a>)</em>\n\nIn a working productive community, it is everyone's responsibility to go out and \"make the sale\". Selling is, to most people, the scariest form of communication there is. The culture in which most of us are raised radiates fear to go out to the market. It is yet another residue of the authoritarian society. In this case, our \u201cconscience\u201d and the \u201cprivate logic\u201d will join forces to tell us \u201cwe are not good at it\u201d, and that this \u201cit\u201d \u2013 selling \u2013 is very close to deceiving. But this is false. <strong>Selling is a radical act of empathy</strong>: it requires us to put ourselves in the other's shoes, understand her needs and honestly explain her why and how we think our work can help her in what she is trying to achieve.\n\nBut it has another side, which is even more difficult and intimate: <strong>face our own fear to be rejected</strong>, to not be given value to. Our products are a projection of ourselves, of our values and of our work. They have value, and in the end this value is instantiated as a price. Defending a reasonable price, that covers all costs and reflects the value to be received by the client, is not easy. We need to empathize with the person we are dealing with. At the same time \u2013 and quite reasonably \u2013 she attempts to make the most of her money, that is, in the end, the result of the effort of her work or that of her organization. For her, trying to reduce the price, is her way to show respect for herself and her colleagues. For us, showing firmness in the value of our offer, reducing the amount of work associated to a reduced price is the way we, as sellers, respect our own work and that of our partners. But it is not easy. Our sense of inferiority will surface in the tension associated to the negotiation, and our fear to be discarded will try to take control to achieve \u201ca sale at any price\u201d or, even worse, \u201ca pilot\u201d, \u201ca free sample\u201d... to convert a sale in an involuntary gift will only make things worse.\n\nThe trouble with selling is not in the act of selling itself, it is in us. <strong>Selling requires courage</strong>. Courage to be firm in our honesty, to not doubt the value of our community's work, and our own. <strong>Selling requires us to be moral</strong>.\n\nThe salesman of the folk tales, the charlatan, the word-quick manipulative person that \u201csells a comb to a bald man\u201d reflects the archetype of another counterproductive strategy: the survival instinct. Speaking without pause, constantly trying to take the buyer by surprise, offer her something different at the first sign of doubt... all these are expressions of fear. And no, they don't work. As many combs as we might sell, can you think of any charlatan that ever managed to achieve a comfortable life?\n\nWe live in a society where the word \u201cmerchant\u201d is derogatory. Like many derogatory words rooted in tradition and in religious culture, it is really trying to achieve a sort of exorcism. Demeaning the basis of one's personal autonomy in an area so important as the market, allows the person pronouncing it to escape a challenge he or she is scared of. The more desirable she, deep down, sees this autonomy, the more she will be comforted by demeaning it.\n\nA small or medium enterprise, a family business, a community that starts producing, needs to secure as soon possible a diverse client base, but selling is also a true test that challenges everyones's moral fiber.\n\nSelling honestly and respectfully, selling with meaning, attaching the appropriate value to human labor, <strong>is an act of self-improvement</strong>. It requires confidence in ourselves. It requires consistency with our own compromises. It requires we overcome our fears. And in a community, or a SME trying to bootstrap itself, it simply must be a shared responsibility, something that everybody needs to be able to do, with everyone else's support. So, nothing reveals the solidity, the intimate strength of a community like its positive attitude towards its commercial, mercantile activities.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-01-29 14:53:28", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:23.072059", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 760, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 66.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 3613], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16861, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2015, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Works for me</b>\n\nWhat time are you thinking about, Lucas?\n\n", "created_at": "2013-10-06 06:51:46", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:34.275670", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 14, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 508, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 475, "post_number": 1, "raw": "", "created_at": "2016-06-15 21:28:47", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:00.934034", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25212, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2385, "post_number": 10, "raw": "<b>Is this a change of direction?</b>\n\n[Simonedb], I have been following this thread, thanks for your input.

Even if you do it in Italian, even if we need additional visuals, we can add translation and beautification later. What matters here, it seems to me, is the value proposition.

They are intimately tied to the two areas touched on in Jonathan's post: language and community.\n\n<strong>A little context.</strong>\n\nAt the moment we are preparing the Edgeryders annual community gathering, called LOTE (Living on the Edge) taking place in October ( <a href=\"http://docs.google.com/file/d/0B81XQfRCH7JmRFlSNXFRM2xPbTg/edit\">Sneak preview</a>\u00a0of work in progress, 23-26 October, save the date!). This year's format is different from previous ones: the physical gathering is part of a long and slow solutions-oriented conversation around community stewardship of physical, digital and sociocultural assets. Rather than a mad sprint towards an event as the endpoint.\n\n<strong>Why slow?</strong>\n\nMaking sense of any complex issue requires diversity. If you care about it being evidence-based, rigorous and effective, you need to give yourself time to ensure a critical mass of people find their way to the conversation. There is a less obvious aspect to this which is tied to language. If we are to build real understanding and cooperation, we need to learn each other's languages. As well as be able to read \u00a0and translate between contexts within which we live and work. \u00a0\n\nI think here a key issue is language dexterity. Being able to pick it up, make it your own... even develop different languages. Even in the same language there are many different worlds, like business speak or street slang or artistic experimentation. Language shapes our thinking and if you do not command that language you are often rejected in that context.. And so on. Translation or interpretation services just are not feasible in our context, we never have the resources to cover those costs to begin with. No, what we need is for a critical mass of community members to be able to move between languages.\n\n<strong>Where to begin.</strong>\n\nI think there could be a lot of benefits of us exploring this as a community, maybe set it up as one of the goals for Edgeryders: promoting and supporting language dexterity of members, conversations, relationships and projects. It will require us to explore and build effective tools and processes in a culture that takes these needs seriously.\n\nPerhaps one way to get this going is to include posts around this theme in a monthly newsletter to the community?\n\nAnother possibility is to engage on a community learning journey where we commit to learning one other language in the community and test and develop further the various parts of the learning package you develop as a collective. \u00a0Perhaps we could even discuss this in a session at the <a href=\"/t/futurespotters-event/410\">#futurespotters event in Tbilisi on june 24-27</a>?\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>https://www.youtube.com/embed/hwlqUremx4Y </span>\n\n", "created_at": "2014-06-13 10:08:59", "updated_at": "2020-02-07 07:10:36.593725", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 703, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 261.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27659, "user_id": 551, "topic_id": 1298, "post_number": 15, "raw": "Hi Alberto,\u00a0 thanks for your constructive and pertinent observations.\n\nI already posted some other positive comments about that on the ER mission started by John.

In which I posted quite clearly that I was attempting to engage capable facilitators before anything would begin. </span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>I appreciate the need to consider the \"goodwill\" of ER LBG but not at the expense of a community led initiative.</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>Instead what happened is that you accelerated the process, and put in place Dorotea as the sole facilitator and pressed go. </span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>It gives off the perception that there is no patience, or real investment in the process\u201d </span>\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>---- </span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>There were some basic requirements; neutral facilitation, level playing field, external support with experience in conflict resolution, </span><span>time</span><span>.</span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>Given this wasn\u2019t acknowledged and was met with a counterproductive attitude, approach and the use of technical admin rights on the platform to force a specific situation (quite counter to the original proposal) only really capable of generating conflict, I chose to take a step back, and let Alberto run things as he saw fit; assuming if there was no respect from the start, it was unlikely to manifest later in the process. </span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>I\u2019m not interested in engaging tribalism, I\u2019m interested in creating space for everyone to have a voice and since that didn\u2019t seem an option, I chose to invest my time in reading over the EdgeRyders documentation, with a view to helping build new processes within EdgeRyders, identify problems in need of fixing and to raise a series of legitimate questions about the governance of ER and how certain events and changes have negatively impacted the development of EdgeRyders as a community. </span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<a href=\"/t/how-edgeryders-has-changed/4260\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span>None of which</span></a><span> have been acknowledged or responded to, which is quite surprising, isn\u2019t it? </span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>---- </span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>Again in the comments made on this thread there are a number of aspersions cast - which I suggested should stop, whilst ER LBG figure out it\u2019s accountability/oversight mechanism and how it should relate to the community. </span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>Talk of non-exec\u2019s having any kind of real oversight, feels to me to be a farce at this point. </span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>---- </span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>On the curious use of the rhetoric of unMonastery vs Community on the part of ER LBG.

Dividing the life into different periods: education, non-work (5-10 years), work, non-work (5-25 years). Talking about young people is also about old people, how the generations can fit together.\u00a0\n\n<span>Challenges on youth unemployment have people with different contexts: disabilities, drop-outs from schools \u2013 mentality, identity, maybe not skills; young people with skills but without jobs or with \u2018bad\u2019 jobs. The new context situation in many countries, is not the underclass, is the change in the society. \u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Nadia\u2019s text on independence and connection to work. Proletarization of work studies \u2013 discussion about what is a good work? Could be the polarization of work \u2013 good versus unsecure work. \u2018Skitliv\u2019 \u2013 insecurity on the labour market. EU-project looking for unemployed young people \u2013 non-work, e.g. ESF. \u2018Jobbskaparna\u2019 \u2013 created jobs to people with disabilities. \u2018Key-figures in Europe\u2019 \u2013 the difference between the different EU-countries. What are the options for policies? EU \u2013 youth guarantee program etc. also in Sweden. Should we then have a citizen salary if you haven\u2019t got a job? Or could you have a kind of model with apprenticeship, learning focus etc., contagious model. Self-employment a second approach. The alternative \u2013 could there be other activities in the society to find own solutions, networks etc.? What could you do? What is an alternative?\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Non-work in-houses very different activities and different people. Three conventional ways: train yourself more &amp; get more employable, apprenticeship \u2013 controversial, self-employment \u2013 problematic that people need to already have a foothold in the labour market.

There is so much expertise out there, how do we organize this? Expertise in new ways. Youth as active! Youth as passive is a false myth. Young people try to fix every people\u2019s problems. To move away from statistical representatives. Looking at the young people that will be the future leaders \u2013 the future representatives. The people that are exploring. The vision was to build a think tank with these people \u2013 only on internet \u2013 accessible: self-selective \u2013 all interested can join, experienced based.\u00a0\n\n<span>The outcome:\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Act 1: the seed: wrote questions that everyone can select the details they find important depending on skills, time etc. Framed the questions in a way that allow inference of effectiveness of education system etc., e.g. \u2018where did you learn your most important experiences\u2019. Campaigns: e.g. learning; mission; mission reports. The person is answering the questions that are right for them.</span>\n\n<span>Act 2: grow: to get people to interact. Used mainstream social media, initial contact with social media and then share this on the social media. It did grow. Started on twitter. Was getting a thick ground.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Act 3: the harvest: how do you do the selection progress? Can gather ethnographic data on a low cost \u2013 were coding the data.

If removing the animators the connections are longer. Could see who is leading the conversation and who they talk with. To figure out what people are mobilizing the others and within what subjects \u2013 what sub communities talk about. To visualize the topics \u2013 how deep the discussions are: how many comments they have.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Result: Built a \u2018novel-space\u2019 for discussing and looking up social problems. It\u2019s inclusive, diverse, open, effective \u2013 relative results, a lot of attention, a way to push the commission etc.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>The future? Might be building the new knowledge product \u2013 between consulting and consultation. If you want to hear what people really want. Giving legitimacy to people buying the consultancies.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Detecting social change. E.g. invalidating standardized thoughts about education \u2013 a diploma is not a guarantee for a good job anymore.

Feedback on the Edgeryders research findings starting with the ethnographic part.\u201d</b></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<b>With: Alek, Alberto, Ola, &amp; (Latvia)</b>\n\n<span>What is the Baltic Sea region? What do we have in common? The region does not really exist in people\u2019s minds.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Poland (Alek): The situation in Poland is quite specific: Poland has experienced a growth, youth unemployment lower than in the south of Europe for example. The big protests were about ACTA, not employment. In public debate is not that significant. Large education boom in the 90s \u2013 more quantity than quality. Tipping point. Poland has pretty high regional differences. Brain drain. South-east of Poland one of the poorest region in Europe, while Warsaw is going better.</span>\n\n<span>Latvia: unemployment is not about young people not getting jobs, it\u2019s about uneducated people not getting jobs. It\u2019s more a problem of retirement. People with higher education tend to get some kind of jobs. The main problem is young people that neither study nor work. People with resources and background and people with no resources: polarization, local metropolis.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Sweden (Ola): 90s education boom. People don\u2019t start university immediately. No bridge between schooling system and work. People don\u2019t feel that they belong in the systems \u2013 people born in the 70s had it easier. Schooling system is less relevant now.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Poland and Germany - IT-people more into societal change, social development innovations. Societal entrepreneurship, alternative currencies, anti-ACTA movement, how to make democracy work better. Why are the Scandinavians not participating? E.g. civil society much stronger in south of Europe.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>A lot of these discussions: the alternative model is maybe not only a separate model, but included as a supplement.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Credit is important to discuss. Two levels: policy level \u2013 the educational system does not work: what to do about it? Individual level \u2013 what is a smart thing for me to do?\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>How to make radical ideas supportable? How to institutionalize innovation? E.g. by income support. The system limits innovation.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Can\u2019t generalize from the Edgeryders members? How to scale up to a broader scale?\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Get out of the grid? Build common goods?\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Non-market measures are considered as not the best way, sometimes even hurting the markets. Failure of only thinking in market terms. Capitalist approach.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>What could we do: rise skills? Lowering costs? The common take over the markets.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span><b>Discussion following the group discussions\u00a0</b></span>\n\n<span>How to sustain the meaning when you are unemployed? Identity. The extent to how we look at jobs regarding identity. The state is normally providing you with money, but substitute for what the meaning of work means \u2013 form a platform from where you reintegrate meaning \u2013 self-unemployment. Graduates without future \u2013 education not connected to jobs. How can you create a meaning? Industries stick in \u2013 the drug industry make profit of this. Have an idea, competing model is still to adapt into the system to increase the costs. Much of the future will lie in the third sector. Caring sector \u2013 the future labour market need hands as well as brain jobs. Hand-jobs would be worth more in the future. It\u2019s worth looking at McKnight (80s) service provision for self-production, risk that there is a mismatch provide the needed thing within the normative framework.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Discussion about the values of contributions outside the labour market?\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Kenneth: transition jobs might be permanent jobs. \u201cThe good work\u201d what do you contribute with? The good working environment, the salary and the contribution to the society. But this is not so much involved in the policy level and the unions don\u2019t want non-profit jobs to take over the employed jobs.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Alek: Work as a category for a good life. People are having problems with not having a job \u2013 apathy etc. a social thing, that you have to work to fit within the system. The educational system - changing now.\u00a0 \u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Daniel: construction with the education. In network society people will have different educational experiences.\u00a0 \u00a0</span>\n\n<span>What is the value of education? Policy discussions see education as training and university education. Education can be something that provides something personally for the individuals, understanding what\u2019s happening in the world.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Caroline: education should prepare young people for labour market, but this doesn\u2019t work if the labour market doesn\u2019t exist. With the competencies you can take on problems, manage different jobs and use these on a scale outside the frame.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Does standardized education lead to employment? In Estonia this is the case.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Christopher: the value of the university degree lowers when all people have it.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Kenneth: benefit more or less for education.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Dougald: To what extent do we deal with a secular crisis: is this a temporal or a permanent crisis? Do we see that everything changes? E.g. China, less GDP per capital but Europeans have an outdated welfare model promoting laziness. What is the natural order of things? Talking about graduating without a future \u2013 we are talking about a reality when young people grow up in societies where they have a worse situation than their parents.</span>\n\n<span>Deeper structural change or temporal stage?\u00a0 Good reason to say that it is not simply about business cycles. It\u2019s how much things have already changed already during the boom \u2013 the debt has been hidden.</span>\n\n<span>Nadia: How much does awareness about the situation play in?\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Kenneth: one way is to include work in education \u2013 get a work experience. If you take care about your future you will be better off.</span>\n\n<span>Christopher: it\u2019s cultural to think that if you are qualified for a job you will get a job.\u00a0 \u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Kenneth: matching problem: maybe the reason for the unemployment is bad matching.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Christopher: what to choose to get a job?

Started in 1957. Structural funds. In 2007 to 2013 600 mn\u20ac. Want to fund projects. Norm instructing. Want to work where innovation takes form. ESF have the instruments, and those that apply are composed of governmental institutions and small companies.\u00a0 1200 projects; 170 working with young people not included in the system. They are trying to apply a bottom-up approach to find their way to an independent living, which is difficult. Combination of bottom-up with more instructive actions to help young people. The young are excluded from the structures they live in. Want to go beyond the thoughts about that you have to go 9 years in schools to be profitable to the society. Want to change the structures because they do not fit with the reality, it is made for one type of person. Believe in help for self-help. Want to make the institutions aware about where they are failing.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Dougald: we know that the institutions like to define people by what they haven\u2019t got. But there is a potential by looking at the target group. The secondary effect is to reproduce the exclusion. Are there ways where we can help the interfaces to build this with the knowledge that we have? Can we use the fly road model \u2013 loose networks connecting to strong institutions such as ESF?\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Nardin: you can\u2019t structure the programs towards a \u2018group\u2019 of people. The targeting is into these walls that we try to rebuild. Those who apply for the money are within the structures.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Alberto: lock-in problems: lobby that does not want to change the situation. Serious large companies are more reliable and the EU wants to support only these kinds of programs.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Nardin: we want to find informal networks.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Nadia: the rules are designed so that you have to be under the umbrella of organizations.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Dougald: we can create a cooperation to achieve what we want and you (ESF) want together?</span>\n\n<span>Nardin: we want to have a mixed \u2018target group\u2019. But then the commission has to ok that. We are still going to have a lot of money and want to find smaller projects, but the government decides on it. Youth initiative by the EU. Transnational networks: to focus on mobility.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Alek: in Poland the funds are more significant. Individual bravery, empowerment etc. hard to do in large scale projects. Have to be brave in order to try new things.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Nardin: the funds are distributed depending on needs. In Sweden ESF wants to work innovative, because it is a small part of the budget and therefore they want to use the money to change things. Achieved regionally but not nationally. Simplicity projects \u2013 how to simplify the funding?\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Kenneth: the co-funding problem.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Direct intervention or social innovation is the way of changing.

One message: world doesn\u2019t change in one day. Real is different.</span>\n\n<span>Threat that you are not reforming it, but become a part of the structure. The main point is therefore to remain outside the political institutional life and to try to impact from the outside.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>The questions are that if they had any impact on campaigning?\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Also to kidnap the concept of patriotism and nationalism in order for the other parties to not go this path.</span>\n\n<span>Very context sensitive thing.</span>\n\n<span>If you lose a job, you lose your identity somehow, and nationalism is easy to fill the whole.

All three are tools, i.e. they are an object, a concept or a pattern that organizes and/or extends our natural abilities and allows us to achieve something that would be difficult or impossible using only our natural abilities without the tool. A business is a tool that allows us to organize our activities in a more or less decentralized way to make use of scarce resources in competition with others who want to use those resources with the same or different purpose. That does not mean it is always the best product that wins getting the needed resources, but generally we can say that this way of organizing our activities make the products improve and that they are offered more efficiently as time is going on. All this while at the same time this way of organizing our activities is made without an excessive centralized control and creating the highly complex and rich contexts that our society is showing (contexts as for example are allowing the current dialogue).\u00a0\n\n<div>\u00a0</div><div>In short we can say that the real tool is the pattern that the business are representing, and this pattern is basically the having to compete for scarce resources based on who generates more value for the use of these resources, while this value exceeds the value of resources used to generate it. And we can say that compared to others, this tool has proven an effective way of innovation and is offering a kind of decentralized organization (almost self-organization) capable of creating rich and complex contexts.The problem is not the tool itself, which has shown to be effective. The source of the problem lies in who owns the tool and how is using it. And using the tool involves defining what is value, because it is what is guiding the tool use, and later is this concept of value which is permeating the contexts created with the tool. Then, speaking from the perspective of balance, we cannot go to the extreme and say that everything in business is bad, cause the pattern being represented by the business is a good tool, what is wrong in business is their current form of ownership (who owns the tool) and their definition of value (how is using the tool).</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>Being the owner \u00a0means having the control and the responsibility by the use of this control, with the value definition guiding this use. Our current lack of social and ecological sustainability comes from a mix of a pathological form of ownership with a pathological value definition. Pathological ownership cause our current forms of ownership doesn't take in account the interest of all those involved in making the business works (workers, providers, customers and the society as a whole), but only the owners interests. And our current forms of ownership ensures that the owners have limited liability. So business are motivated to go against the interest of the whole society if their pursuit of value maximization is leading to that, even if it hurts society and its environment, because their liability is limited. And in fact our current value definition is guiding business against the interest of the whole society, cause we have a pathological value definition, one in which the value is defined by the short-term financial benefit and that is basically all that matters, period! A vision of value completely dehumanized and indifferent to the balance with the Earth system (despite some recent cosmetic changes).\u00a0</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>And now the situation can get even worse, cause more and more value is being based on the expropriation of the \u201csocial intelligence\u201d, i.e. the short-term financial benefit is generated through all of our social interactions, that is our life. And, if the goal is to maximize value, then the traditional procedure for that is to take control of what is producing value with the goal of maximizing that value. Therefore the next logical step is to take control of our life (as is the main input of the current value production), starting with the control of the means for generating the knowledge (education), and our networking mechanisms.Then as the the process of creating value is becoming less and less limited to the single \u201cworking sphere\u201d (in the traditional sense), but extends to more and more to encompass all the entire human existence, we have two paths; or permanently lose control of our lives giving them to businesses that will make use of every moment of our 24 hours. Or take for us such control, i.e. redefining the ownership concept and we all becoming the owners of those businesses. But businesses that are not more business in the traditional sense of the word, but which are becoming services through a value redefinition that puts the welfare of the people and their environment as its maximization goal. Services that continue using the pattern being represented by the businesses for innovation and self-organization, but where the owners are all the involved with the service operation, and where that operation is guided by the welfare of the people and their environment, not by short-term financial benefit. To these kind of services is to what I'm calling <a href=\"http://jcouchet.wordpress.com/2012/07/04/ecoservices/\">eCoServices</a>, which are defining a new form of ownership and are following the guidelines from the <a href=\"http://jcouchet.wordpress.com/2012/07/03/obediential-framework/\">obediential framework</a> to define value.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>So Noemi, after this long introduction, I can say yes, that the <a href=\"http://jcouchet.wordpress.com/2012/07/04/ecoservices/\">eCoService</a> breakthrough comes from the ownership redefinition, cause as I was explaining above, on the ownership issue lies one of the sources of our current lack of social and ecological sustainability. And yes, you are basically right about the 'voting power' concept, but I want to make clear that the \"points\" you are receiving as a user are coming essentially by the use of the service, because in using it, you make the service not only possible but more valuable, and that service does not necessarily have to be an online platform (*). Then the <a href=\"http://jcouchet.wordpress.com/2012/07/04/ecoservices/\">eCoService proposal</a> is that both founders and users are owners of the service and this ownership implies that both are allowed to participate in the decision making process involved with the service operations (**). The ownership is defined by the 'voting power', that is meaning real ownership with real control over the business, and also as in the society where the power to vote is equal for all regardless of the resources a person is having, the 'voting power' is also equal for all. The difference is how the founders and users are acquiring the 'voting power'. The founders as are those who initially created the service and launched it, at the beginning have a lot of 'voting power', basically in relation to their level \u00a0of contributions made \u200b\u200b(although the use of logarithms make the difference becomes smaller), but as time passes, their 'voting power' is decreasing until to be constant at 1, one person, one vote. For the users is the opposite, they are starting with a zero 'voting power', and as time passes and they are using the service, their 'voting power' is growing in relation to their \u00a0service 's use level until to be constant at 1, one person, one vote.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>Then an online community as Couchsurfing -of which I'm myself a member - does not work in this way, just Couchsurfing is an example of how badly things can go with the current forms of ownership, and in fact it was Couchsurfing which inspired me to the definition of ownership stated above. In Couchsurfing, although mostly of the full value of this service at this time is created by users, who are the people who receive the guests (the surfers) in their town and that are giving them company and housing, those users have no power to decide on the operations of Couchsurfing (you can read some more <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/mine-becomes-ours/mission_case/tale-about-basic-human-decency\">here</a>).</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>(*) For example, in a medicare service, every time a person is using the service, the person is making the service more valuable, because the person is improving in health and the service aims to maximize the welfare of the people and their environment, so the service by improving the health of a person is maximizing its value definition. But there are different types of use for \u00a0the same service (I'm calling to each type of use: <a href=\"http://jcouchet.wordpress.com/2012/07/04/ecoservices/\">service contribution</a>). As for example, it isn't the same type of use the fact of using the service for a surgery to correct something acquired through bad habits, that using the service for a preventive purpose, such a routine medical checkup or requesting to the nutritionist a diet in order to have a healthier diet. Then each service must intelligently define the types of service contribution and the value of each one, where for example such assistance for the surgery to correct something acquired through bad habits may be worth 0.01, and the assistance to a routine medical checkup worth 1.\u00a0</div><div>So, where is really the crisis? Where we are placing the value, i.e. in our minds. So now we are saying that we are in crisis because there are not enough short-term financial benefits, but changing our definition of value it is changing our definition of crisis, and the measures to attack it, for example, not cutting the health expenses, but rather by increasing the resources allocated to health. That is, the crisis is a state of mind, because in both situations really there are not shortage of resources (the real resources aren't money), and the amount of resources are the same.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>(**) \u00a0We cannot forget that next we must define - based on this definition of ownership - the <em>governance</em> process that is responsible for defining the decision making process. But trying to avoid the current problem of our society where the way to institutionalize the power makes it far from its true source and prone to become fetishized. And to avoid that in addition to designing balanced governance structures according to the <a href=\"http://jcouchet.wordpress.com/2012/07/03/obediential-framework/\">obediential framework</a>, we must experiment with the technology in order to take advantage of its undoubted capability to increase communication, direct participation, transparency and decreasing bureaucracy.</div>", "created_at": "2012-07-08 17:16:25", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:20.788947", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1845, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [22579], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20570, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1272, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Super</b>\n\n<span><span>It's great to</span> <span>see this list</span><span>.</span> <span>Really relevant</span><span>.</span></span>\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-10 04:58:52", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:54.540264", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 38, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32064, "user_id": 1933, "topic_id": 2692, "post_number": 39, "raw": "<b>shorten your links here</b>\n\nHi @dorotea,\n\nI guess you know about this one:\n\ngoo.gl\n\nit's really helpful for me.", "created_at": "2014-05-05 05:17:53", "updated_at": "2018-03-03 10:00:41.662589", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 23, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [32039], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29265, "user_id": 1825, "topic_id": 2434, "post_number": 18, "raw": "<b>CURRENT SITUATION</b>\n\nJust wanted to share with you the story that appreared in our local newspaer about the said land. they are talking about compensation but this will be to only those who had builed semiparmnanet houses\u00a0 in other part of the land but not necessarily the displaced persons camp. see below:\n\n<table align=\"right\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td>\n\n\u00a0\n\n</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\n\n\u00a0\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n<div>\n\nBottom of Form\n\n</div>\n\ntoday's Pick\n\nNHCC to compensate Kasokoso residentsPublish Date: Mar 13, 2014\n\n<img alt=\"NHCC to compensate Kasokoso residents\" src=\"file:///C:%5CDOCUME~1%5CGuest%5CLOCALS~1%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_image001.jpg\" style=\"height:332px; width:500px\">\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>\u00a0</li>\n\n<li><img alt=\"http://www.newvision.co.ug/images/print.jpg\" src=\"file:///C:%5CDOCUME~1%5CGuest%5CLOCALS~1%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_image002.jpg\" style=\"height:25px; width:59px\"></li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://www.newvision.co.ug/news/653500-nhcc-to-compensate-kasokoso-residents.html\" title='\"Email\" t '><img alt=\"mail\" src=\"file:///C:%5CDOCUME~1%5CGuest%5CLOCALS~1%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_image003.jpg\" style=\"height:18px; width:55px\"></a></li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php\"><img alt=\"img\" src=\"file:///C:%5CDOCUME~1%5CGuest%5CLOCALS~1%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_image004.jpg\" style=\"height:20px; width:49px\"></a></li>\n\n</ul>\n\nAn aerial view of part of Kasokoso which is located in the Banda and Kireka areas, sitting on a hill off Kampala-Jinja highway, 5km away from Kampala.

The residents were protesting the plan by NHCC to survey and demarcate the land.\n\nThe residents later petitioned Parliament, through their MPs Rosemary Sseninde (Wakiso Woman, NRM) and Ibrahim Ssemujju Nganda (Kyadondo East, FDC) requesting the House to investigate how the land in question changed ownership since 1966.\n\nWanangwe dismissed reports that NHCC plans to forcefully evict the residents. He said the residents will be given the first opportunity to be part of the project but \u201cin case they don\u2019t want to, they will be paid and allowed to leave peacefully.\u201d\n\nAnswering the MPs\u2019 concern on the cost of the new Houses and whether the residents will afford them, Wanangwe said the houses will be affordable to all classes.\n\nAccording to him, the Houses will comprise of those for low income earners, lower middle income, middle income as well as high income earners.\n\n\u201cNHCC and Government will help the poorest people access affordable mortgages which can be paid over an agreed period with banks. After this payment, the person will acquire a title,\u201d he said.\n\nMP Waira Kiwalabwe asked the officials to explain how NHHC came to own such huge chunk of land and also clarify the reports that the land belongs to the Kabaka of Buganda.\n\nThe officials explained that NHCC acquired the land through a lease of 99 years in 1966. They also presented letters from Buganda Land Board clarifying that the land in question neither belonged to the Buganda land board nor the Kabaka.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-03-20 06:56:19", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:41.010711", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 826, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6329, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 6296, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/e/ee2d9ae8b7b48ddaeb18b1604e9a3a688cbfc2d0.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"362\">\n\n<strong>\"We know, the pitch looks better than reality\"</strong> \u2013 says Marten Kaevats. \"But we're working on it.\" I look around.

We were born as the project of a supranational institution, the Council of Europe. We developed as an online community, with members living in 50 countries. When we built a company on top of that community, the six members of the board were citizens of six different countries. Our first clients were global too: the United Nations Development Programme, UNESCO, the World Bank.\n\n<strong>Our loyalties are to Planet Earth, and to each other.</strong> From a legal point of view this does not fly: a company has to incorporate in one country (and almost all countries design for traditional companies, and make no provision for businesses like us). In 2013, we chose the United Kingdom. It seemed, and was, a natural choice. It has a great ecosystem of services to business. Government services are well thought through, well documented and online, from HMSC to the Information Commissioner's Office. The main black spot is banking: expensive, dysfunctional service, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financial-crime/9736167/HSBC-pays-1.92bn-to-settle-US-money-laundering-claims.html\">ethically dubious banks</a>. But the advantages outweighed the disadvantages.\n\n<strong>And then Brexit came</strong>.\n\nThis is not the place to discuss the political hows and the whys, nor am I particularly qualified to do it. I want to look at Brexit and post-Brexit from a risk management perspective. There are two kinds of risk here, and both were obvious even before the vote.\u00a0\n\n<strong>Risk number one: becoming a bargaining chip</strong>. Over 3 million EU citizens living in the UK were not allowed to vote, or even consulted. They were, in the political jargon of the time, \"a bargaining chip\". The UK only cared about nationals. We are not nationals. What if the government decided to play hard and fast with the assets of companies owned by foreign nationals? Freeze our bank accounts, for example? Could we be the next bargaining chip to throw on the negotiation table?\n\n<strong>Risk number two: taking collateral damage because of the government's incompetence</strong>. No one knows for sure what the consequences of a hard Brexit will be. What happens to the treaties on double taxation, within Europe or outside? What to VAT on cross-border transactions? What are the consequences of the UK not being a member of WTO anymore (its WTO membership went through the EU's collective one)? These would be hard questions for anybody. But the British establishment keeps going through \"oh, shit\" moments. Wait, what about the Irish border? What about Gibraltar? What about funding to research? What happens to trucks queuing up at Calais and Dover in the case of hard Brexit? All this handwaving\u00a0has not done much to reassure us.\n\nSo far, I have given you\u00a0the rational argument for not being comfortable as a business owned by EU nationals but incorporated in a post-Brexit UK. We also have reasons of the heart: we are not big on nationalism. Nationalisms killed a hundred million people in Europe during World War 2 alone.\u00a0<strong>We believe, instead,\u00a0in\u00a0peace, peace\u00a0and prosperity through trade</strong>. Trade is communication: to sell something, you have to put yourself in the shoes of your client, to empathise. <strong>This vision is clearest in the project of a united Europe, the more united the better</strong>. We\u00a0<em>feel\u00a0</em>united in Edgeryders: we hail from every nation in Europe, and many outside it. <strong>We enjoy our unity in diversity, and will allow no one to put us against each other.</strong>\u00a0\n\nOur minds and hearts, this time, were in agreement.\u00a0We have become Brexit refugees. And we need to do what refugees do: move.\n\nWe applied to Estonia's <a href=\"https://e-estonia.com/e-residents/about/\">e-residency programme</a> before the vote even happened. <strong>We chose Estonia because</strong>:\n\n<ol data-offset-key=\"6704s-0-0\">\n\n<li>\t<strong>It is in the EU and runs the Euro</strong>. We don't risk losing\u00a0access to our major market. We are protected against currency turbulence.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>\t<strong>It makes explicit provision for location-independent businesses, like us</strong>. E-residents are <em>meant</em>\u00a0to be foreign nationals, or Estonians abroad. \u00a0</li>\n\n<li>\t<strong>The game theory checks out</strong>. Look: Estonia is a tiny country, with only 1.3 million citizens. They aim to have 10 million e-residents by 2025. And that's the entire country's business plan right there, because 10 million e-residents translate into 100,000 good jobs in finance, insurance, accounting, real estate. If the e-residents are unhappy, they will go somewhere else, and Estonia can't afford that. So, they will keep us happy, and we will keep their business plan humming along.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nAs Marten admits, the system is far from perfect. For example, the Republic's banks and accounting firms are subject to international anti-money laundering regulation, aka \"Know Your Customer\". So, the government allows e-residents to incorporate a company from a web page... but then your accountant will ask you for a utility bill as proof of residency. Banks are even firmer: either you show up in person, or no account (regulation is in the pipeline that should solve this). Estonian professionals are still new at this game, and it can be difficult to get information.\n\n<strong>But Marten is right: it will get better.</strong> Estonia wants to be a \"pathfinding\" country. Given how small it is, this makes sense in a way that it would not in Germany or the UK. They have plenty of vision (\"country as a service\", \"zero-legacy policies\", \"accounting 3.0\"). They have a young, energetic ruling \u00e9lite. They can do this. We look forward to be part of it.\n\nSo, say hi to Edgeryders Osa\u00fching. It is an Estonian private limited company, incorporated as of March 30th 2017. We will be phasing out Edgeryders Limited By Guarantee in the course of the next year.\n\n<em>Photo: Troy David Johnson on flickr.com</em>\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-10 19:56:56", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 18:44:45.744816", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1335, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 473.2, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 8, 2915, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29563, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 5102, "post_number": 11, "raw": "<b>Thanks for the heads up,  got in touch</b>\n\n...let's see what they reply :)\n\n", "created_at": "2016-01-17 14:49:44", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:42.744313", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 18, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [29131], "is_liked_by": [2201], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26057, "user_id": 2551, "topic_id": 520, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Thanks for sharing!</b>\n\nThese stories here are so well written and impressive - and this one particularly so.\n\nIt still took me a few attempts to endeavour it, because more often than not it'll tempt you to throw everything down and want to help with what the author is working on. This one is no exception.\n\nHowever this time I've been busy with something that could make a contribution that is interesting to your case ( @kate_g ) . I've been meaning to do it as a little story aswell but it really is only hobby format now - and I'd need someone with other background to apply it.\n\nTo keep it really brief I'll just lay out the bare bones, though in application it could be tweaked in very different directions (education, journalism, anthropology/ethnography).\n\nIn terms of concept think the opposite of broadcasting*, where one signal (on one schedule) goes out to everyone. Here I try to reach niches, perhaps indirectly, as much on their schedule &amp; terms as possible, and I listen to them (ratio of listen/tell can be tweaked).\n\nIn terms of hardware I am currently sitting on 10 cheapo mp3 players and some mp3 voice recorders. The idea is to put some audio content on a small memory card (perhaps also some visual content e.g. on playing card size). This costs 2-3 $ and can hold days worth of structured audio content. The strucure of the content is important because I hope to turn the play+listener into a temporary agent (a little tolkeen's ring style). So you would have incentives there for the player (or several) to traverse the community networks in a mix of chance, human behavior, and programming, and hopefully end up in someones lap who may have been incredibly hard to find using other methods.\n\nYou can then get the recorder to this person (or have the person respond via a phone recording in a \"relatively 1st world context\") and document things in long form (8 GB - up to a week). Parts of this will be amiable for speech to text conversion. ( @brenoust that is why I asked the last time we talked)\n\nOnce you get the text corpus you can open it up the the digital domain ( @amelia can then probably mine this from an enthnograpic/anthropologic perspective) while it can remail fully anonymous. I also have a concept in mind for quantitative feedback which is similarly simple tech for users (colored beads on a string) but machine readable.\n\nThat way you get quant + qual abstractions but you can still jump to the original content fairly easily (provided you speak the language). It ought to scale quite well, especially if you can reuse some of the players.\n\nThe motivation for this came from a number of directions (OLPC griping, importance to capture emotion in human interaction, World Bank issues/capability building (two way!)) so I've played through a couple of different concepts that can perhaps be divided by organizational/technical aspects, content/didactic aspects, and info flow direction/volume.\n\nI'm currently working on putting together a prototype kit that could plausibly run for a couple of months (and with minor support perhaps years) as a replacement for a \"sit-in school\" in remote areas that have trouble with teacher absenteeism ( @nadia perhaps interesting to Olivier @ Co - also best of luck in Paris!) and people being too poor to abstain from manual labour for so long (and of course blind, illiterate, etc.). At the moment I'm checking the recharge curves to see how long the cheapo players will survive before someone needds to know how to fix/replace/work around the battery. If any of you see potential there I'd be happy to discuss it and set it up as a proper story.\n\n*that is why the working title is currently \"small casting\". Suggestions welcome :)\n\n", "created_at": "2016-11-23 15:27:59", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:24.029525", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 671, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30454, "user_id": 217, "topic_id": 2070, "post_number": 20, "raw": "<b>thanks!</b>\n\nI hadn't read up on the unDojo yet. cool!\n\n", "created_at": "2013-10-25 10:10:32", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:47.689009", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 15, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [30345], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2938, "user_id": 1935, "topic_id": 2905, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<span>\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/755fc867dbf9d494bde2591b8e5fa588fd604355.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"387\"><br>\n\nHello future spotters !!

It's difficult to know what's appropriate, what's essential, what can take us forward to the next step!\n\nBut as Alberto has <a href=\"/t/last-push-unmonastery-lite-unmonastery-summit-at-lote4/3621\">prompted</a>, there is obviously a desperate need for reflection and action - so I wanted to get a post going to discuss this. Certainly we will live the unMonastery, be it lite or not, <a href=\"/u/bembo_davies\">@Bembo_Davies</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"/u/katalin\">@katalin</a>\u00a0have stepped up to lead on this - with details to follow.\u00a0\n\nI've shared below some initial ideas for sessions - please suggest others and tweak these but lets aim to solidify at least 3 sessions by Friday, latest.\u00a0\n\n<strong>Going Global:\u00a0</strong>\n\nIn January 2015, we will host the first of a series of events; large scale unMonastery Summits, designed to grow and build on what we have learnt - in each instance we will live variations of the unMonastery life, quick sprints on rules from the rule, summits will act as labs for revised iterations on the protocol.\u00a0\n\nBut going global isn't easy, when we started unMonastery the sense was that property and land was beyond our reach, having now completed the first iteration of the never ending prototype - we find ourselves with a glut of offers and possibilities - from existing monasteries, to Greek land, buildings and small settlements in Spain. The issue of expansion is no longer a material one but a capacity one, who will lead future unMonasteries? Where will they draw their brethren? What are the unseen stumbling blocks of growth?\u00a0\n\nThis and many questions pervade the future development of the model. We say 200 years but do we know what the first 5 looks like? Should we rush to start more? Is the unMonastery a slow growth model? Should we limit the total number to roll out? What are the permission mechanisms needed to help others initiate? Is there any element of the model that's centralised?\u00a0\n\nThe questions role on and there are many we must face if we are to commit to the claims we've made.\u00a0\n\n<strong>The Materan School of the unMonastery:</strong>\n\nPrior to our departure from Matera, we declared in earnest that the city be our natural birth place, that any continuation of the unMonastery be unthinkable without the location being the bedrock of our 200 year march - but how can we return? And what in our absence have we neglected?\u00a0\n\nLOTE4 presents a unique opportunity to interrogate and evaluate what we did in Matera, how we might do better - but most importantly it puts everyone in the room who is capable of bringing the unMonastery back to the city, and assessing if the deep desire to do so is enough to ensure it becomes reality.\u00a0\n\n<strong>unMonastery in-a-box, does it work?: </strong>\n\nFrom the start we stood in the shadow of giants, firstly the monastic path we drew on, secondly the hacker spaces we'd learnt from. Replication was always the goal and we presumed the tool kit could be conceived of replica tools from that which we knew; the book of mistakes, the draft protocol, a wiki full of learnings and pattern languages, a card deck to hold bind it together and a talking piece to ensure all voices might be heard.\u00a0\n\nBut what state is this in? Where did we get to and is what we have even legible?\u00a0\u00a0This session would focus on interrogating our work, bringing in outside but invested voices to perform an autopsy on our work and feed back to us the results of their post-mortem examination.\u00a0\n\n////////////////\n\nIt goes without saying that there will be a series of public sessions detailed on the LOTE4 program, but like the life of unMonastery, much of our work will be processed over the dinner table and in clandestine night time gatherings in the caves of Matera. But no one should forget that LOTE presents us with a special opportunity to progress our work in the presence of others, an opportunity that cannot be missed.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-09-21 15:50:56", "updated_at": "2018-06-01 03:52:18.669068", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 782, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30651, "user_id": 3559, "topic_id": 869, "post_number": 12, "raw": "this is the most dynamic one", "created_at": "2011-10-11 10:17:17", "updated_at": "2017-09-10 23:40:21.610867", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 6, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26478, "user_id": 2320, "topic_id": 3715, "post_number": 7, "raw": "hey daniele, what's the password to view the video?\n\n", "created_at": "2014-10-02 10:46:30", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:26.738053", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 12, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26812, "user_id": 3074, "topic_id": 5658, "post_number": 11, "raw": "<b>Got the extension too</b>\n\nfor luce.chiodelli@u-bordeaux.fr\n\n", "created_at": "2016-06-06 08:22:58", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:28.326412", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 14, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18633, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 1991, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>thanks Ronen.</b>\n\n...\n\n", "created_at": "2013-10-09 13:45:34", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:44.010498", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 6, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [18340], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22165, "user_id": 3271, "topic_id": 645, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>Thank you for your kind words</b>\n\nThis\u00a0talk is very intersting\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-05-14 14:08:32", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:03.523986", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 17, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [20198], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10554, "user_id": 1629, "topic_id": 2350, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Speakers</b>\n\nCan't have a good party without speakers.

We have been trying and achieving promising results, mainly by growing <a href=\"/t/a-list-of-recent-acts-of-resources-sharing-and-transparency-from-edgeryders-lbg-to-the-community/4279\">the number</a> of projects and people involved in running them. \n\nEdgeryders never had a development model. Both the company and community evolved through trial and error, and a lot of experimentation. It became obvious ever since last year\u2019s LOTE4 community event that we need some fixes in housekeeping and information management in order to move forward and preserve health. The challenge brought forward repeatedly is: clarify how anyone can use the platform as a common resource and where the entry points into formalized roles are; spell out mechanisms to protect anyone from abuses (newcomers and community members doing regular work altogether). \n\nTo give you an idea of how this year unfolded in response to the above: in March we were launching a process for <a href=\"/t/stewarding-ourselves-2-non-executive-directors-wanted-for-edgeryders-lbg/4255\">two community elected</a> board members in order to join the company and do oversight on behalf of the community; in April one of the operational directors at the time resigned from the board; we welcomed Patrick Andrews as the new (interim) director, unfortunately not without <a href=\"/t/beginning-of-a-great-adventure-patrick-andrews-joins-the-board-of-edgeryders-lbg/4433\">fallouts</a>. Egos were hurt and some people took a step back in their own ways. Others decided to fail forward. During May-September us directors had to reassess, do a lot of admin cleanup and also run projects, hence the delay in making faster progress. Where there seems to be agreement is on the need to maintain a healthy environment for a growing number of community members using Edgeryders to work on projects in different parts of the world. Not everyone has the same historic knowledge of the community, nor the same expectations or even demands. One thing I've learned is that we should be designing for diversity and on a basis of mutual trust.  \n\nSo here\u2019s where we are, hopefully we're moving somewhere better. Whatever your thoughts, please stay constructive and back suggestions with an offer to take responsibility for making changes happen.\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Housecleaning and written policies. <a href=\"/u/alberto\" title=\"Alberto\">@Alberto</a> in particular has put in quite some work in outlining the social contract between company and community in clear words, particularly by explaining how the company works and makes use of this platform. You can find the description of roles, the ER statute of incorporation, financial report for 2013-2014 (we haven't closed accounts for 2014-2015 yet), the brand use, social policies and how to navigate roles from community member to company member in the <a href=\"/edgeryders-lbg/help-info\">main menu  - under Help/Info</a>. This link now goes into the welcoming message of every new platform user, particularly the <a href=\"/t/edgeryders-lbg/351/privacy-policy-and-terms-of-use\">terms of use.</a> </li>\n\n<li>Hosting the first annual general meeting of ER LbG. It happened on August 5th in Brussels and we voted Patrick Andrews in as a new director. Yay!</li>\n\n<li>Changing the structure of the board. Because there was no leadership from the community as to who the non-executive directors would be and their role, we are trying out a new structure with a board of directors (all executives) and a board of advisors (who are not necessarily members in the company), the latter appointed in the persons of @Emkay and @Dorotea. This is for 2015-2016, and they are mandated to come up with a process for next year selection of advisors. Both Emkay and Doro have full access to company administration and will be interfacing gracefully with whoever needs information or support. Read more about the advisory board <a href=\"/t/edgeryders-lbg/351/advisory-board\">here.</a>\n</li>\n\n<li>Enlarging the core. For the future we dream of large numbers of networked Edgeryders driving their own ER related projects and enterprises, under \\#newwork headers compatible with own style and aspirations. We're starting this by writing highly collaborative projects like in <a href=\"/en/opencare\">OpenCare</a>, working our strategies for <a href=\"/t/so-how-do-we-learn/4829\">growth</a> with folks eager to get more involved in Edgeryders, or making an investment in the upcoming <a href=\"/c/workspaces/lote5\">Living On The Edge 5</a> coordinating team at Antiheroes, without so much dependency on the usual organisers. Taking on themes such as failure and fuckups is not coincidental, we have lots to share and learn from.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nThis is pretty much it, keeping up the work and searching for ideal protocols!\n\n<small style=\"\"><em>Image credit: </em>http://www.thisbusylife.com/</small>", "created_at": "2015-10-14 09:27:36", "updated_at": "2017-11-14 18:46:18.030040", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 874, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 21.6, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2551, 4, 2201], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19329, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 1084, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Welcome!</b>\n\nAnd thanks for your offer :) We're happy for having more helping hands.

This is bringing to light many tensions and discomfort, some of which can be attributed to growing pains. Others come down to failings of a number of individuals, myself included, due to egos and misaligned expectations as well as cultural differences. I think it is important to acknowledge this and for everyone who cares about Edgeryders to exercise both restraint and kindness in how we deal with one another in the coming months.\u00a0\n\nNone of this would matter if it were not for the many remarkable achievements that are cause for celebration. The biggest of which is that we are all still here- the number of members and projects that use the common infrastructures we have all built together is growing. This is cause for celebration. It also gives rise to a growing number of demands to accommodate with very limited resources. There are many unanswered questions as to how we can sustainably accommodate the growing number members and projects using the shared infrastructures in a way that is aligned with our values, sustainable and fair.\n\nA key condition for meeting the new challenges is establishing a process that ensures any and all demands of the shared infrastructures are backed by credible commitment of resources by those who are using them. Another one is ensuring there is a clear, and structured process for interaction between the members of the community in a shared online platform, as well as between the community at large and the directors of the <a href=\"/en/company/home\">company</a> that has been sustaining Edgeryders and providing resources and both to support community members with opportunities and for building, developing and maintaining the Edgeryders online ecosystem.\n\nThis is not something that will happen overnight nor can it if we really want to do this well, while learning from our mistakes and taking enough time to fully explore and understand different options for moving forward together. Rather this is a process to pursue over next 1.5 years starting from January 2016 in order to allow for sufficient time to honor existing personal and professional commitments as well as to facilitate participation of the whole community.\u00a0\n\nIt is against this backdrop that the executive directors of Edgeryders LBG make a majority decision to welcome Patrick Andrews into the board to help with this transition. We are very pleased that he has chosen to accept the invitation and look forward learning with and from one another as we embark on a new journey together.\n\n<a href=\"/u/caroline\">@Caroline_Paulick-Thiel</a> has very kindly stepped forward to facilitate this process, and we are exploring how we can support her in practical terms. Once we have established a clear timeline we will reach out to all the members with the invitation to participate. We look forward to learning from and with everyone who wishes to contribute to what looks like an interesting and turbulent next phase of the Edgeryders story.\n\nWith love,\n\nNadia, Alberto, Matthias, Noemi and Patrick\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-28 12:59:58", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 23:38:00.483153", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 595, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32850, "user_id": 3310, "topic_id": 6059, "post_number": 41, "raw": "<b>first draft for a abstract</b>\n\nHi there,\n\ni've just written down a first possible abstract we can shape according to the ideas and backgrounds of all the people involved in the paper.\n\nSee you in Rome.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-01-22 17:46:37", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:00.309757", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 45, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17559, "user_id": 1450, "topic_id": 3620, "post_number": 4, "raw": "alberto, thanks for this.

Les souvenirs d'antan, les bons moments pass\u00e9s ensemble, sont ce qui motivent les gens \u00e0 reprendre contact avec d'anciennes connaissances.\n\nEdgeryders est une premi\u00e8re, en termes de communaut\u00e9 en ligne de citoyens, ax\u00e9e sur la collaboration avec des institutions gouvernementales. Il s'agit de la toute premi\u00e8re fois qu'une telle communaut\u00e9 peut se rencontrer en personne, d\u00e9passant les fronti\u00e8res du virtuel pour se consolider dans le r\u00e9el, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le Conseil de l'Europe a eu la g\u00e9n\u00e9rosit\u00e9 de d\u00e9frayer les d\u00e9penses de d\u00e9placement de chacun des participants.\n\nMorgane, merci de penser \u00e0 la p\u00e9rennit\u00e9 de la communaut\u00e9 Edgeryders. Nous ne pouvons pas d\u00e9cider et agir pour les autorit\u00e9s du Conseil de l'Europe et de la Commission. Nous ne pouvons que les encourager \u00e0 agir.\n\nMais nous pouvons faire des petites choses simples, pas compliqu\u00e9es, comme consolider nos r\u00e9seaux, nous relier les uns aux autres sur LinkedIn et dans les m\u00e9dias sociaux. Nous pouvons d\u00e9velopper des amiti\u00e9s solides entre nous, appr\u00e9cier ce que font les autres participants, et continuer de nous int\u00e9resser \u00e0 eux, apr\u00e8s que la conf\u00e9rence ait eu lieu.\n\nAvec les d\u00e9cideurs qui participeront \u00e0 la conf\u00e9rence, nous pouvons tenter de garder contact \u00e9galement, et sauter sur toutes les futures occasions de collaboration qui se pr\u00e9senteront, tout en maintenant la mobilisation entre nous.\n\nSi les liens sp\u00e9ciaux que nous ressentons pr\u00e9sentement se maintiennent dans le temps, les participants et les autorit\u00e9s sentiront cela. Il est probable que la plate-forme Edgeryders soit gel\u00e9e d'ici la fin du mois. Je me demande jusqu'\u00e0 quel point il sera possible de maintenir les liens du groupe, en absence d'un espace virtuel commun. Il faudrait peut-\u00eatre songer \u00e0 cr\u00e9er un lieu parall\u00e8le de rencontre, apr\u00e8s le 30 juin 2012?\n\nQuelqu'un --- un(e) participant(e) devrait recommander que soient \u00e9valu\u00e9s les possibles m\u00e9canismes de p\u00e9rennit\u00e9 de la communaut\u00e9 Edgeryders, dans un des 6 groupes de travail. (<em>Moi, je ne compte pas, je ne suis qu'un engagement manager.</em>) Quel groupe serait le plus appropri\u00e9 pour cela? \"We the people\"? \"Caring for Commons\"? \"Living Together?\" Humm. Il y a 6 groupes de travail, et plusieurs facilitateurs pour chacun d'eux. Voici ci-dessous les liens pointant vers ces groupes.

los indignados refined their strategies or went home to Mamma.\u00a0 Several creative wars decimated traditional buffer states.\u00a0 Bolivia continues to get its act together; Turkey doesn\u2019t.\u00a0 It feels as if it is business as usual -- only much more severe for a significant percentage of the world\u2019s population.\u00a0 Meanwhile, personal survival reared its familiar head. \u00a0 The Edgeryders became less about the greater we, and more about economic strategies for a generation of upstarts trying to make their way as\u00a0 <i>Social Capitalists</i>. \u00a0\n\nI miss the open horizon.</span>\n\n<span>This is not a case of \u201cEdgier than Thou\u201d - these things have to be cyclical.\u00a0 Everyone brings their own individual amount of angst and imperatives. Should we wish to avoid despair and paralysis we have to incorporate individual survival strategies and denial mechanisms.\u00a0 However, neither Edgeryders nor its unHoly unRepresentative on Earth is an entertaining role play.\u00a0 Hikmet says it all, it must be taken with great seriousness.\u00a0 Vinay\u2019s take on WW III is apt enough:\u00a0 having been cuddled by favourable citizenship and a well-fed past cannot be allowed inform our choices.\u00a0 Our mission is to locate the edge and to ryde it at its most dangerous.</span>\n\n<span>This radical portrait of the core operation may not be a universally shared view of the impulse behind the unMonastery movement.\u00a0 People were recruited from various channels; is there anything else that would better illuminate our operation ?</span>\n\n<span>Writing a list of what the unMonastery isn\u2019t could be equally misleading as any of the flowery descriptions of its promise.\u00a0 Let it suffice to paraphrase an old quote:\u00a0 \u2018not another little residency for urban refugees nursing their gluten intolerance\u2019. \u00a0 To couch it in positives, we were a workshop that confronts the self through relevant service.\u00a0 I would underline the word relevant.\u00a0 If we learned anything in Matera it was that it is only by strategically negotiating this relevance within the human environment that surrounds us that we can obtain anything nearing social sustainability.\u00a0 Our service must be tangible, our self-sacrifice evident to all.\u00a0 The ryde is serious.</span>\n\n<span>Team building is essential.\u00a0 Before we do almost anything else, this requires meticulous meetings that produce profound, visceral agreement. \u00a0 Beyond coordination of the physical plant, we must address strategy and objectives in a manner that cements the group rather than one which feels like a compromised maze of intellectual fence building.\u00a0 For many raised in a competitive school system this takes comprehensive re-education.\u00a0 Listening and comprehending are not necessarily innate skills of the modern, impatient human.</span>\n\n", "created_at": "2014-12-15 16:04:48", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:22.565274", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2236, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2377], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33191, "user_id": 1658, "topic_id": 3351, "post_number": 46, "raw": "<b>15 euro a day hostels!! :)</b>\n\n<a href=\"/u/jamesl\">@JamesL</a>\u00a0and others I have three friends with hostels up for 15 euro a day for Edgeryders.\n\n1.

This has been consistently effective for short term collaboration.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tEdgeRyders.eu/unmonastery : The page you're looking at now, which has become the most used space for developing and sharing unMonastery.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tSunday Google Hangouts: We did this for several months and then when I stopped organising them they stopped, weekly was too much. This should be revived but it would be good to share responsibility, running them on a fortnightly/monthly basis.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tThe Website: Again has become an archive of sorts, despite the implementation of a super friendly CMS.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<b>Issues: </b>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\tTransparency\n\nThere is a clear lack of transparency and protocol for new comers or existing EdgeRyder members getting involved. This isn't because unMonastery is a secret society but rather, it's not clear what needs doing and how to start.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tDecisions\n\nare having to be made that effect the future shape of the project. This for the most part is happening in a centralised way, participants and collaborators are too distributed, so key questions have to be answered by me, in the moment.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tHorizontalism\n\nOnly works if individuals take responsibility for the way they wish the project to exist.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tExtended time\n\nunMonastery Matera was set to open in September of this year, if not earlier, in this moment the first iteration is the core engine of the project, as the project has been drawn out maintaining the momentum has been hampered.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tZero Resources\n\nWhilst the Matera side of the unMonastery project has some resource (a space, some administrative support, occasional flights and accommodation for events), the overall project has to date been run on community energy alone, much like the EdgeRyders platform.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\u00a0\n\nThese observations are clearly drawn from my own perspective as a facilitator of the project, I'd be curious and keen to know how the project is perceived by those reading this post \u2013 what issues have I potentially missed? Also where could I have personally done better? Lets be transparent.\n\nMy motivation for writing this post is to put everything out there in the hope that collaboratively we might begin to think up some smart design solutions for the future development of the project, since this will be crucial to success in the lead up to LOTE3 and the February launch.\n\nYou may have worked on similar projects or in familiar ways, and already have the solutions we need. To get the ball rolling, I've outlined a number of things below that I believe would help the project \u2013 feedback and suggestions always appreciated.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>Some potential solutions:</strong>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\t<strong>Call for participation within defined roles.</strong>\n\nI've written a <a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/unmonastery-roles-a-call-for-participation\">separate post here</a> calling for individuals with an explicit set of skills to join the project \u2013 there are many people out there that are excited about the unMonastery but may not be able to join us in Matera. It's my hope that by posting these positions we might expand the core team in a concrete and sustainable way. If you know anyone who might be interested please direct them towards the post.</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<strong>Adopting the EdgeRyders task model.</strong>\n\nAlberto recently wrote a brilliant post (<a href=\"/t/making-lote3/360/lote-organizational-architecture-a-proposal\">/t/making-lote3/360/lote-organizational-architecture-a-proposal</a> ) proposing a framework for delivering the next LOTE, focused on decentralisation and the packetisation of tasks. Should we adopt this for all aspects of unMonastery? Or is there an alternative route? How well has it worked for EdgeRyders so far?</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<strong>Landing strip.</strong>\n\nunMonastery needs a place where individuals who are new to the project can get an overview at a glance, as the project is highly distributed and difficult to understand at times. What's the best format for this? I had started to produce a popplet \u2013 but perhaps there's a better approach! What would be a smart way of integrating calls to action into such a thing?</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<strong>Informal discussion space.</strong>\n\nDo we require an alternative discussion space? Posts created here hold a certain weight as do the considered comments members of ER and unMon make on each one. UnMonastery suffers at times due to the geographically distributed nature of its contributors. I feel personally that we need something <b>like</b> a google group for experimental, not yet fully formed ideas and musings. Would you participate were it to exist?</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<strong>The website.</strong>\n\nRequires design solutions, perhaps just in the form of a committed web editor, who can filter content from here to there.

It was a Friday night. Loud electronic music came out of the speakers, a surrealistic video played on the wall. The Georgians here looked quite different from the people I saw on the streets. I felt like I was in an underground club in Berlin, or New York. But no, it was Tbilisi. And this was one of Wato's projects.</em>\n\n<em>Wato is an artist, and has been actively trying to change the world around him. In 2009 he founded the <a href=\"http://www.cca.ge/\">Center of Contemporary Art (CCA)</a> in Tbilisi, the first of its kind. Last year, when Edgeryders came to town for the first time, I was hoping to organize the international conference at CCA. Because we speak the same language. Because at CCA, they use artistic mechanisms to tackle social issues: they collaborate with a biological farming organization, they stepped away from traditional education and offer an informal master's degree, and they research self organizational systems in Georgia before communism came and destroyed the practice.</em>\n\n<em>Wato and I met at CCA, on possibly one of Tbilisi's hottest summer days. Hidden in a courtyard with large factory-like buildings, the center is not easy to find. Only a small sign on the door gives away what the building hosts. The staircase is old and untouched, the details tell stories. </em>\n\n<em>It is quite a surprise when you walk all the way up the stairs and enter CCA's space. </em>\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f0e9014dba725403060e084270fb05db8abe8486.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"459\"><br>\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6283e323fd40111cb26e59654aaa5dd13f06e6ab.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\"><br>\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Wato explains me that CCA's core direction is education. They have an independent study program for 9 months, an informal master program. It's near masters level, but they don't have a license, no accreditation.</h3>\n\nIn Georgia if you have more than 9 months education program you need to have a license. And a license means that you are controlled by the state basically, and that you can't do many experiments. Because it is difficult to articulate this.\n\nSo we found this niche to have a program less than 9 months. It is a new type of profile, which we offer, and this profile is something hybrid between artistic practice and being a producer.\n\nHere students are doing different artistic disciplines, starting from cartography, video, installations, and more.\n\nStudents also do social studies, where they contact closed circle societies, which are closed in their own area and not really interact with the world around. We want the students to individually go inside these societies and invite people from there to be part of a project. And invite other artists, to form a group, on an equal level of creativity. And together with socially disadvantaged people and artists, realize different projects.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">The educational program is very successful, Wato tells me.</h3>\n\nNow it's vacation, but generally it's very busy with students. We have now 20 students. So it has been growing and we have more and more people who want to be part of this study program. Also, because they see that people from here, when they finish their studies, they really get connected to the art world, not the commercial art world, but the institutional art world. They get residencies, for example.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">One of their alumni, <a href=\"http://anachaduneli.tumblr.com/\">Ana Chaduneli</a>, is in Zurich for 4 months, she won the Tsinandali art price, was in Norway, in Nice in France, and currently is invited to participate in the Istanbul and Kyiv Biennial. There are others as well, for example <a href=\"https://www.behance.net/giorgimaghradze\">Giorgi Magradze</a>, who is traveling around Germany at the moment.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Wato taught at the state academy of art when he realized it was not working, that is when he founded CCA. He tells me about the differences he sees between art academy students and the students at CCA.</h3>\n\nTwo years ago, the final show of our students took place in <a href=\"http://www.villa-arson.org/\">Villa Arson</a> in Nice, a very prestigious art school and gallery. Art academy students could not dream of it.\n\nWe don't have accreditation and we don't give diplomas, but for us it is still possible to do such kind of large scale exchanges, with academic institutions in Europe.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/f/fe5fb39238f19ebc1dd08275a7e0b554afe64170.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"459\"><br>\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnother example is also quite telling, I think:\n\nThere were six artists invited to France, chosen by an international jury. Five of them were our alumni and one was from the art academy. I mean, if you compare, the art academy has thousands of students and more than a 3 million GEL budget. We have 20 students and a 70.000 GEL budget per year. These are numbers, but I think they speak for themselves. It means something, right?\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">But education is not all CCA is involved in. They have been working on agriculture for several years already, which they call Artistic Thinking in Relation to Organic Culture.</h3>\n\nIt's about implementation of artistic practice inside other fields of our life. In Artistic Thinking in Relation to Organic Culture, we talk about everything related to farming:\u00a0composting, cooking, anything related to nature basically, the environment.\n\nWe collaborate very strongly with NGO <a href=\"http://www.elkana.org.ge/index.php?action=0&amp;lang=eng\">Elkana</a>, it's a bio farming association, for years already we work with them. This is a core part of our work.\n\nIt is natural, if you look at art. Art thematically can cover everything, it can be about psychology, it can be about family, it can be about nature, it can be about architecture, it can be about war, it can be about everything, refugees, immigration.\n\nIt means that art has, in fact, the potential to generate some position towards anything in the world.\n\nYou know, art is always about enlarging the borders of what art was before. We have this term called relational aesthetics. If you don't know you it, should read it: there is a book called <a href=\"http://www.kim-cohen.com/seth_texts/artmusictheorytexts/Bourriaud%20Relational%20Aesthetics.pdf\">Relational Aesthetics</a> by art theoretician Nicolas Bourriaud. It is seen as one of the most important books after the second world war. Relational aesthetics means, that art work is not necessary something that you produce and hang on the wall, but it can be a situation. It can be a social setting, it can be some kind of niche you find in the society, it can be a construction. I call it social architectures, some kind of opportunities and possibilities to be among the different social layers.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1c6c26ea63b6c005f5ea6c2129e9d3c91532f275.jpg\" width=\"333\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd art is kind of a mode of thinking. Basically. A mode of producing. Other people use only rational thinking mostly, artists are trained to use accident, mistake, contradiction, intuition. So artists have different modes of arriving to a result, from different ways, and everybody has it, you know. But artists are professionally trained to cultivate all these different skills, so that's why they can also have different solutions, or different ideas about anything in our society, in the world.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">As a result, CCA collaborates with several different organizations, both in and outside of Georgia.</h3>\n\nWe work with the <a href=\"http://icomos.org.ge/betlemi/betlemi3/\">Betlemi Information Office</a>, which is ICOMOS representation. We work also closely with people in psychiatry, there is an institution called <a href=\"http://empathy.ge/en/\">Georgian Center for Rehabilitation of Torture Victims</a>, we have been doing shows together.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Wato is interested in giving artists in Georgia a frame of reference. That is why they organize exchange programs, and that is why they also want to explore what history teaches us. Communism destroyed systems of self organization, it also rewrote art history. Both are detrimental in building an artists self-esteem. Because if someone else from Georgia could be a part of large international art movements, if someone else from Georgia could built a theater together with their peers, than why can't you?</h3>\n\nMost important artists and tendencies were not accepted by the communist regime, they were killed or deported, they did not become part of art history basically. So now we don't have really art history that is reflecting real processes going on in the 20th century.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/8/82f33cb6cec6b04c11094c22e24058de56daa34b.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"459\"><br>\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe have a project to make a book about 20th century art history. We have divided it into 6 different chapters, the 20th century, the communist times. The first chapter was published already, about the end of the 19th century, before modernism. Now we got funding from the ministry of culture and Soros foundation to do modernism, which will be a very large issue. Bilingual, in English and Georgian. And so we will make 6 publications, which will become six chapters of the book.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Self-organization systems seem a large theme at CCA today. And rightly so.</h3>\n\nOur students formed <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/newcollectivetb/timeline\">The New Collective</a>, maybe you've heard of these girls. Eleven girls. They participated in a workshop by Nina Henrickson, a swedish artist, on self-organization, And after the two week workshop, the eleven girls, the participants, decided to form an association. We supported them with a small fee for the foundation, and now they are already really well known. They were invited to Manchester to open a festival. <a href=\"http://georgiatoday.ge/news/436/When-Fiction-Meets-Reality%3A-Georgian-Artists-Refused-Visas\">They didn't get visa though</a>, but they work now on this issue of migration.\n\nAlso, in October starts the second edition of <a href=\"http://www.biennialfoundation.org/biennials/tbilisi-triennial-georgia/\">Tbilisi Triennial</a>, which we organize. The name of it is S.O.S.: Self -Organized \u2013 Systems.\n\nIt is about mechanisms and tools of self-organization.\n\nWe identified three: agricultural, village community, how is it self organized? Another is about professional unions, like guilds. And the third is the self organization around a common interest.\n\nFor example in Kakheti, in kvemo machkhani, we found a theater. It was build in the 19th century, by just the will of the people in the village, everybody, farmers, aristocrats, united their energy. They wanted to have a theater, and they build a theater. It is still standing now, quite intact, a European style theater. It is absolutely a unique case.\n\nWe got money from Soros foundation and\u00a0the community development foundation\u00a0to research and publish a book. About ten cases of self-organization before the communist regime.\n\nIt is very strange that nobody else has researched this idea before. Of how Georgian, or any post soviet countries, had these systems of self-organization before communism.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">And that is the reason Wato started CCA.</h3>\n\nWhen people ask me, why did you start it, what was the trigger, I say the trigger was frustration. Because I was working in the art academy, the state art academy, and I saw how this institution is anachronistic. And instead of developing people, they are mutating people.\n\nBecause their programming is really beyond any context, there aren't any contextualized curricula and strategies.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/4/4346ec248badde837b781428203ea7029bfcc086.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"459\"><br>\n\n\u00a0\n\nI started this in 2010, I was still working at the art academy.\n\nAnd I observed how our students here were literally flying to other places, to show their work and resonate outside of their homes in Tbilisi. And art academy students were standing still in one place.\n\nBasically, on one hand it was a lack of relevant art education, on the other hand there was no platform of contemporary art. Because, before if you would come to Georgia, and you were interested in contemporary art, you would arrive into some artists kitchen or privately. And there was no place where you could come and connect. A platform, use it, or work with it, or get some advice or support.\n\nSo this is like, a station I like to say, for contemporary art, which works in many many ways.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI must say one thing, that from my kind of temperament and my education, I am an artist myself. If you are once artist, you can not change.\n\nWhat I do now with any kind of work I do, like administration or organization, still somehow, everywhere I seek creativity, it is all the result of creativity.\n\nIf you ask me: \"what is CCA for you?\" my answer will be that it is an artistic work. Because we invent things. We invent a new profile for studying. We invent artistic farming. We have other things we invent, social settings, like having a school without credits and without points and without exams.\n\nIt is how you kind of create and balance social settings. In this case about knowledge production and knowledge transfer.\n\nOf course, most boring is to deal with project proposals and reporting, but it's also not so heavy that you would say I can't do it.\n\nAnd what I mostly enjoy is, that when the students make a first exhibition, and I enter the space and I feel a good atmosphere, this is the most, biggest, I don't know how to say, happiness.\n\nBecause it is a compliment. Because when we know that our students get scholarships, get residencies, then we know it makes sense what we do. It is not like we spend energy and it is for nothing. So that is feedback from their side.\n\nAlso, when we have exhibitions and people are coming and visiting and staying. You know, sometimes, everything is finished, three hours past, but people wont go away. Because they feel good here, this is also a compliment. The atmosphere is in a way that is magnetizing people to be here.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/4/4fca3b65c1d3051e282bd1ea0da23790d7c7ba16.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\"><br>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">CCA is lucky to be funded for three years by the Deutscher Volkshochschul-Verband (DVV) for their informal master, as it as a core maintains the whole institution.</h3>\n\nBesides DVV, we are project based funded. Now the ministry of culture is also changing their strategy, they will have program funding. This means that you can propose one year in advance, and you can get funding for this program, and you execute this program later.\n\nWe also don't pay rent for the space, which is a very important starting point. We work with the museum of medicine history and we develop this museum. We bring so much input in the museum that it would be much more if we would just pay rent. This is a win-win situation, where our creativity and our experience is used for the development of the museum. And we get space in exchange for it.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">The daily practices at CCA are also mostly focused around the educational part, but not only.</h3>\n\nUsually, on a daily bases, there are 4 hours a day different lectures. We have many artists and people from theory and history which are rotating, in blocks, 8 lectures, 4 lectures, sometimes 1, masterclasses, workshops.\n\nWe work also weekly, we have meetings. Today we had a meeting about the triennial.\n\nBut it is very informal, everything. It's very important to keep a balance between informality and responsibilities, because you can totally loose your community if you're not careful. We also have the understanding we have responsibilities, we have to keep things going, it needs effort.\n\nI think that most important is that people coming here feel themselves well. Many young artists, young students, come from different milieus. The come here and they feel as if they are elsewhere, being in another space you know. And they feel well.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">And what support, besides money, could CCA use?</h3>\n\nMoney, it has never been a sensory point for us to work. Very important, what we would really need, is to get a good structure, get a better structure.\n\nI think what we have to learn from the western world, Georgians and other post soviet people, is how to work in a structure. How to be more efficient with a structure. Because that's why there's a structure, to make things effective, to make things efficient.\n\nAnother thing is of course that we could use more international partnerships. We have a lot of international partners. I mean, if somebody is tells me 'I will contact you and you will have new contacts', I am not sure.\n\nWe have many contacts, I mean.\n\nBut most important I think is to have partners which you personally know and which really have interest to work with you.\n\nEastern European countries \u2013 except Poland maybe \u2013 look to the west, so they are not so much interested in the East of them.\n\nIn our case we are interested in, 360 degrees, everywhere around us. Because I think it is stupid to just look 1 degree.\n\nFor example, CCA is part of the Asian Art Network, it took place in Korea where I was invited to represent CCA. It was very interesting to work with partners from Iran, India, China. These world are very interesting.\n\nSo, I think that the most crucial for us would be on the one hand structural advices, development, and on the other hand also to have opportunity for younger colleagues to have short internships, to visit other institutions where they can learn from practice, how things work. I think those two things are the most important.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5c3556beebc05de155334966fafdbe08717ee486.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"459\"><br>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">And what can CCA offer?</h3>\n\nWe are very open.\n\n<span>What we can offer. We can offer residencies, we can offer a change of opportunities, we can offer exhibition practice, anything which is relevant.</span>\n\nWhat we can offer, also, is that we can have interns here, for example. We have one girl here now from Paris, from Sorbonne, studying museum studies. She's for two months on internship here. She's doing many different things for us, and for the museum of medicine history, which we are cooperating with.\n\nI get really hundreds of emails, unpaid, where I just suggest people whom to meet, where to go, what to visit, finally I maybe not even meet these people, But I work to kind of coordinate and help them find the right things for them. It is also like a service in a way.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">From our talk it is very clear that CCA works both internationally and domestically together with several different partners. So what does it mean to them?</h3>\n\nPooling resources is very important, I think in general human resources is the most important problem in our part of the world. Because there are not many people which have, on one hand, the awareness of contemporary culture and, on the other hand, skills to operate in it, and be relevant in it. So, to kind of find the right resources together, it is crucial. You can't make a one man show.\n\nMutual support is solidarity, in which different institutional bodies, different personalities, have solidarity for each other. When they need support and help each other. Or work together in a way, or having the same aim, standing next to each other.\n\nCollaboration is something more than all this. Collaboration is when already things are happening in a kind of synergy. Different skills, different talents, different resources, of people and institutions, are really very closely connected to each other and serving each other.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/d/d177eed048eba94703109976f56166565ca7d7af.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"459\"><br>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">Wato and CCA are here to stay for the long run, to change society step by step.And do it his way.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">\u00a0</h3>\n\nI was invited to speak at Ted talk, and I refused in the end, because they said \u201coh, this is not so TED-ish\u201d or \u201cThis needs to be more TED-ish\u201d, ok, I mean, for what should I do it. And they said: \u201cFor prestige\u201d. And so I refused to take part. I would have done it if they'd allowed me to do it in a way I wanted.\n\nI don't go away from Georgia. I've been away and returned 1999. And since then I work here. I studied from 1994 till 1998, and I worked one year for Belgian television. And then I returned. I never had the idea to stay.\n\nI think it is very important to live here. Because there are so many things that need to be done. And I don't find it so difficult.\n\n<em>Photos by George Surguladze</em>\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-24 22:56:10", "updated_at": "2018-06-05 15:41:40.541426", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4104, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 50.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2201], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3557, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3524, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<a href=\"/u/elami5\">ElaMi5</a> has written to me that she needs a letter of invitation to LOTE4 to show to her employer. <a href=\"/u/natalia_skoczylas\">@Natalia Skoczylas</a>.

He has a strong presence in social media and applies his philosophical discoveries to various fields: business strategy, product design, e-learning, innovation and training. He practices a philosophy that relates to generic philosophy, by no means the science of science, not the ultimate knowledge about all knowledge.\n\nMichel sees philosophy as a good companion, allowing to look into situations and systems, a way to organize what we perceive in a different way, through an exploration of the human being. Everywhere he goes, Michel is a good companion: he discusses with many and helps people think.\n\nHe creates models of situations, operations and relationships. His models, accurate examinations of any moment, show that any actor is involved in several situations and therefore simultaneously holds different roles. Models produce a variety of knowledge, explanations, forms, allow to test their existence in a continuous manner.\n\nFor Michel, the problem of leadership is related to the definition that we give it and our definition of the world, ie the first individual to which this definition refers. Michel believes open government needs to develop a model of the world, at least describe it, have it explored. Innovation should be guarded against any predetermination. Open access requires the design of new tools for processing such data, because all data processing tools require prior specifications. One of his models predicted that the more new data is available, the more ordinary actions, having already taken place, are being justified.\n\n<strong>Read more about Michel</strong>\n\n\u2015 Comment je suis devenu philosophe <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/share-your-ryde/mission_case/comment-je-suis-devenu-philosophe\">http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/share-your-ryde/mission_case/comment-je-suis-devenu-philosophe</a>\n\n\u2015 Un philosophe a-t-il son mot \u00e0 dire sur l'open government? <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/we-people/mission_case/un-philosophe-t-il-son-mot-%C3%A0-dire-sur-lopen-government\">http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/we-people/mission_case/un-philosophe-t-il-son-mot-%C3%A0-dire-sur-lopen-government</a>\n\n\u2015 \"Data\".

Next week you should reach out to them, but without investing too much in them: just look at the websites, try to determine how much traction they have, write to them asking for a phone call or some info. If this turns out interesting results (like \"edgy\" attitude or good numbers) we'll follow up.\u00a0\n\nMeanwhile, I rewrote the <a href=\"/t/egypt-mission-report-draft/4495\">Egypt mission report</a>. What I am asking you now is to integrate your remarks into that document, by the beginning of next week. The links to government documents should go as a bullet point list into the final section (Useful links...). The place where to insert the workshop outcome and the Giza story are clearly marked. About that: did not either you or <a href=\"/u/hazem\">@Hazem</a>\u00a0mention a minister who has urban planning background? Or am I dreaming?\n\nHegazy, to change the status of a task do this: click on \"reply\" or \"add a comment\" or whatever. The editing window of the comment appears. Above the \"subject\" field you have status variables for the task: Date, Assign to.. and Status.

Through partnerships with people in Matera, we have created over 50 short videos. A new video is posted online every day. The videos are an opportunity for people to share their ideas, concerns, dreams, work and passions. These \u201cvideo portraits\u201d have become a way for people to connect with others in Matera and hopefully begin to understand more about unMonastery and our work here. The videos reflect the character, resources, expertise, knowledge, and desires of Matera, and have the ability to spark conversations locally while also provide a way to connect the local issues to global trends.\n\nFrom these videos, and the conversations that have happened before and after, several themes have emerged:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Work (either as a passion, a way to get by, or lack of employment opportunities)</li>\n\n<li>People stay in their own circles</li>\n\n<li>Artisanal practices as a source of pride, passion and identity for Matera</li>\n\n<li>Individual versus collective</li>\n\n<li>Creativity</li>\n\n<li>Tourism alternatives and a sustainable economy</li>\n\n<li>Returning to Matera after time away and/or trying to find a way to live here</li>\n\n<li>Accessing local expertise and knowledge that is held by \u201cnon-experts\u201d</li>\n\n<li>Matera is much more than the Sassi</li>\n\n<li>Need for another kind of politics, need to work together</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nWe will continue to gather these video portraits, but we will also develop events, working groups, projects and online platforms to address the topics brought up in video and conversations.\n\n<strong>Local challenges it addresses:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Lack of a global view on the city.</li>\n\n<li>Intergenerational spaces.</li>\n\n<li>Significant lack of offline engagement or visibility for happenings throughout the city.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>How the Project has changed:</strong> The most significant change is that the video productions are not occurring in groups of students learning production but as a tool of engagement to connect Materani and identify themes of concern, expertise and interest.\n\n<strong>Challenges:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Not speaking Italian and needing help with editing and interviews.</li>\n\n<li>Not having consistent student groups to work with on the productions.</li>\n\n<li>Inability to garner long-term commitment to video production projects with individuals.</li>\n\n<li>Spending time on internal UnMonastery issues and planning.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Successes:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Spontaneous and quick productions in which people can speak about issues and ideas important to them almost immediately after a first meeting.</li>\n\n<li>Working collaboratively with many different people, usually from Matera or Basilicata, in both production and post-production.</li>\n\n<li>Positive feedback from the people who have been featured as well as people who have viewed the pieces.</li>\n\n<li>Working together with many different people on productions has made it possible for people who don\u2019t know each other to engage in deeper conversations about ideas and experiences that they might never have a chance to share.</li>\n\n<li>Have been able to identify themes in what people care about and are interested in, which has led to creating events/projects that build upon these themes and make connections with Matarani already working on the same themes (for example: alternative tourism, work, and artisanal practices, unused spaces)</li>\n\n<li>People have the opportunity to learn from each other and discover there is a broad range of knowledge and expertise among their fellow citizens.</li>\n\n<li>Videos completed in a short amount of time and are easily distributed online.</li>\n\n<li>Through the spontaneous productions more people feel a part of unMonastery and know about our work.</li>\n\n<li>We have had the chance to collect perspectives from people from Alta Mura, Montescaglioso, and Pomerico- spreading the reach of unMonastery beyond the city of Matera.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Activities and Outputs:</strong>\n\nOver 50 short video portraits of people of Matera, which create an overview of the things people are thinking about as well as help to promote unMonastery throughout Basilicata. I am transitioning into several projects that will foster more in-depth conversations between people who are interested and concerned with similar issues and long-term sustainable change. We are planning several events and working groups to address the themes identified in the video portraits, as well as developing a possible online structure for initiating more collaboration among people with shared concerns or passions.\n\nCurrently I am:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Mapping the video portraits and finding a way for others to easily add their own portraits, with the hopes that people will begin to feel connected to people that they don't know in their geographic area.</li>\n\n<li>Creating a searchable system so Matarani can listen to others interested in the same topics and find a variety of perspectives on a similar topic.</li>\n\n<li>Focusing on the Piccianello project with other UnMonks to create a map of the cultural commons, with the idea that it will be the first step in finding a way to identified shared resources, and new ways of managing the responsibilities and benefits of those resources together (in partnership with the University of Basilicata and Casa Neutral).</li>\n\n<li>Continuing video portraits but with a new focus on the themes that have developed: unused space, work, traditional local practices, the commons, tourism and sustainability.</li>\n\n<li>Working on the best way to engage people in Matera for a more long-term engagement with the project and unMonastery \u201cliving and working as an Unmonk\u201d event - May 3.</li>\n\n<li>Planning the second sustainable tourism working group meeting- May 6</li>\n\n<li>Posting new video daily.</li>\n\n</ul>", "created_at": "2014-04-27 06:47:42", "updated_at": "2018-06-01 05:40:39.337755", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 978, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 50, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 28, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2017-07-08 23:46:14.512308", "updated_at": "2017-07-08 23:46:14.512308", "deleted_at": "2017-07-09 22:54:26.048122", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11907, "user_id": 1450, "topic_id": 3963, "post_number": 3, "raw": "haha. thanks, I should have thought about that before!\n\n", "created_at": "2014-12-01 18:16:57", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:08.230137", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 11, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [9894], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5349, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 5316, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Op3nCare is an open collaboration platform hosted by Edgeryders. <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/bNtfZj\">Join</a> our global community to make health- and social care open source, privacy-friendly and participatory.\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">HOW TO PARTICIPATE</h2>\n\nOur challenges, projects and programs are modeled on Edgeryders collective intelligence methodology.

I'm approached by people in a middle of a professional crisis. I do not know if my suggestions are always good for any situation, but I think that they could not make your path worst ;-)\n\nFirst of all crisis is a terrible thing to waste. This is such an incredible opportunity for grow and change, because there are people that will never discover that they took the wrong path and they will live forever sad. You have this gift to choose. Your crisis is the crack that force you to choose. There are people disperate outside bagging for an external agent that will force them to take a great decision in their life.\n\nYou have it. Do not waste it in worries or fears. Embrace it and ride it as much as you can and try to keep a bit of it forever, because this will make you always in a quest for something better and will give you a better chance to be happy. (\"Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish\" it is all about this spark, IMHO).\n\nSecondary a crisis like this about a professional path, is particulary valuable when you are young, because you are plent of time to restart, even from scratch.\n\nTry and fail is the only possibilty we have to find our path. It is normal and it is absolutely right to fail. It is our society that is telling us that failing is for losers, but in fact it is just the way has to be. Failing without changing, that is for losers!\n\nAnyway... Those are social considerations that probably are not really helpful in your moment in time :-)\n\nWhat you could need now is a mentor, a role that is completely missing nowadays. Somebody that could nurture your skills, help to sort out your feelings and challenging you continuosly, help you to find your own questions and answers. Few of us are lucky enough to have parents like this, or their boss, or their friends. I'm not, I never found one.\n\nBut I read some books and articles and I had some interesting conversations that helped me a lot not in finding any answers but really improved my process of \"centering\" and understanding.\n\nIt is no easy when you are searching in yourself so deeply, and there is no guarantee on results. But this is the exciting side not the sad one! Life is a journey and we can just learn how to run better because at the end of the race there is dead, not any prize (well at least from a not religious point of view).\n\nOne of the books I found really interesting for myself is called \"From Good To Great\" by Jim Collins.\n\nThe book is about a study he made on why some good companies became great one and some not, which are the hided reason why? Yes is about companies, strategy and leadership but there are some models that we could use for ourselves too.\n\nImagine to draw three circles, so that there's a common area in the middle of them. Each circle will contain your answer on one of the following questions:\n\n1) What are you deeply passionate about?\n\n2) What are you are genetically encoded for \u2014 what activities do you feel just \"made to do\"?\n\n3) What makes economic sense \u2014 what can you make a living at?\n\nThe intersection of the three answers/circles could be your lens to check if your decisions are coherent (and so they are probably creating a better value, a bigger possibility to success).\n\nI'm passionated about cooking, I'm really a great speaker, everybody loves to hear me and I feel that when I speak that's my \"moment\", and I'm paid to draw blueprints all day long.\n\nHow could I realize myself if my actions, feelings and DNA are going in three different directions?\n\nAgain: I'm passionated about dogs, I'm really good with animals and I can't live without them, and I'm working as employee in a multinational company. Is that so wrong? Well... of course is not, because we all have to live and get money for it, but may be you could find a way to make your life more satisfying adding an hobby based on your wishes, or just trying to be an employee for a company that works in the pet market.\n\nThen there's your past. We often became sad because we can't stand the fact that we waisted our energies (money and time) to achieve something that was wrong. This is really a mistake. If you get our lawyer degree your studies certainly made you a different person. May be it is just knowledge (even if I slighlty do not believe it), but what you are now is the results of everything you made in the past, studies included. And studies are never wasting of time.\n\nNow is not the moment to think about a (possible) mistake made in the past (which I prefer to call it a less good decision, in this case). It is about how to make the best out of it now, using what you learned to create a better you in the future.\n\nChanging patterns is a great way to find new possibilities. So I completely agree about your decision to take an year off on something completely different. Do not stop. Search again. May be you'll found an NGO and thanks to your studies, you'll have better chance to help more people.\n\nEnjoy the ride!\n\n", "created_at": "2011-11-23 12:59:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:54.702486", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1003, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3562, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 3529, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2014-08-27 20:20:28", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:19.422766", "deleted_at": "2017-09-19 15:03:32.873052", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7983, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 3132, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Education as a public good</b>\n\nHi Ani, welcome to Edgeryders!\n\nSo sorry I don't speak or write Armenian, but Google translate didn't do such a poor job this time translating to me your text.

The name of the project is a combination of the Greek words \u201cTop\u00edo\u201d (place) and \u201cT\u00f3pi\u201d (ball), which points to youthfulness, games and children.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/0/0a162d66440fb8f1a36b56d8839e2a3b5e44e9c8.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\">\n\n<small class=\"noclass\">photo credits: Olympia Datsi</small>\n\n<small class=\"noclass\">stencils: <a href=\"https://www.google.gr/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiSma2v0oDPAhWMXSwKHVoqC7oQFggbMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.popuppaperstories.com%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNH9hJ0sL76H6P1_7WGgl6lF9p-Qlg&amp;sig2=E0KKrXDBvQmnjbvUAJVZFA&amp;bvm=bv.131783435,d.bGg\">Pop-Up &amp; Paper Stories</a></small>\n\nOur vision is to re-imagine the school as an open platform of discussion and interaction for the whole neighbourhood, where students lead the transformation both inside and outside its premises. We wish to get youngsters caring for their local community and public space, by initiating cultural and other activities. At first, these take place inside the school building and yard, and are then transferred out to the neighbourhood, eventually empowering them to invite the local community inside the school.\n\nOur team focuses on enriching original and location-specific ideas with data, information and constant interaction between the local community and the public space. Based on previous experience, we develop various educational tools for \u201cplacemaking\u201d that are not previously known to the local communities.\n\nAlthough the whole process meets several obstacles, such as bureaucracy, we remain focused on our vision, trying to seek collaboration with the municipality and other local authorities. However, it is very important for us to preserve our self-organization and encourage bottom-up action.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/615a45a8a5a8ce283a55bf50256bc9842cd570f2.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\">\n\n<small class=\"noclass\">photo credits: Vivian Doumpa</small>\n\n<strong>Who benefits from T\u00f3pio?</strong>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Youth (school kids &amp; university students) wishing to become catalysts of change in their own neighbourhood in collaboration with their teachers.</li>\n\n<li>Local communities wishing to contribute to social cohesion and upgrading the urban landscape.</li>\n\n<li>Everyone who wants to be active and participate in the development and co-formation of public spaces.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nT\u00f3pio kick-started as a pilot project within the framework of the START: Create Cultural Change, by Robert Bosch Stiftung conducted in cooperation with the Goethe-Institut Thessaloniki and the Bundesvereinigung Soziokultureller Zentren e.V.

For example, we are very proud of our involvement in the project \u201cThe City at Eye Level\u201d working with Dutch \u201cStipo\u201d and other practitioners.\n\nWe are reaching out to citizens through a <a href=\"http://topioplacemaking.tumblr.com/\">dedicated website</a> and our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/topioplacemaking/?fref=ts\">Facebook page</a>, which includes all information that needs to be transferred to potential beneficiaries.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/0/001416a24b650263d0593835a55c600e1f28d0e9.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\">\n\n<small class=\"noclass\">photo credits: Callie Vei &amp; Alexandr Emmanouilidis</small>\n\n<strong>The people behind the idea</strong>\n\nMy name is Vivian Doumpa and in my early 30s, I have a degree in Urban-Regional Planning &amp; Development Engineering, and I am a post-graduate in Urban Geography specialised in music in public spaces. I have a long-life education in music, and I am currently participating in a project of the research team \u201cCritical Music Histories\u201d. I am also the co-founder of \u201cCreativity Platform\u201d, a non-profit, collective scheme, seeking to function as an interdisciplinary platform of exchanging ideas, actions, research and applications related to the \u201ccreative capital\u201d and the \u201ccreative economy\u201d in the city of Thessaloniki as well as the whole of Greece in general. Since 2016, T\u00f3pio is a significant part of this collective scheme. Being in charge of the project, I had the chance to enrich my professional experience with technical seminars in Project Management (Germany), in the field of Cultural Management. It was a great challenge to combine Urban-Regional Planning and enhancement of active citizenship with creative means.\n\nMy partner, Olympia Datsi, works as a freelance trainer and mentor in the european/international volunteering field and non-formal education, co-ordinating youth projects. Moreover, her educational background based on Landscape Architecture, Interior Design and Fine Arts. She is in charge of the educational activities of T\u00f3pio, dealing with communication, training and empowerment of high-school students and citizens. Since 2013, she is also co-founder of the \u201cCreativity Platform\u201d and has a massive interest for sociology and public space.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1b5db5adf2e8418d8c686d86ce1fee3b76fcd2a5.JPG\" width=\"690\" height=\"454\">\n\n<small class=\"noclass\">photo credits: Victoria Datsi</small>\n\nAs with all like-minded people, our professional relationship and friendship run on the basis of trust and respect. After all these collaborations in multiple projects, we have learned many things from each other\u2019s capacities. We have taught ourselves what is the best way to move forward with the project: from sensing children\u2019s needs and stimulating their interest in the public space, to approaching municipal stakeholders.\n\nThis good spirit of synergy and way of thinking and acting helps us to make progress. And we enjoy this feeling of pleasure and satisfaction when people get motivated by our ideas. One of them is my mother, who is really supportive and active in our interventions in the neighbourhood. Although in the first place it was quite hard for her to understand what actually \u201cplacemaking\u201d is about.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/680a7b5ed23a73b69b6f6faeecabd383ea954b85.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"459\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/8/8bca19de13305353465c4b363276b5cd5963b6b1.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"459\">\n\n<small class=\"noclass\">photo credits: Vivian Doumpa</small>\n\n<small class=\"noclass\">Artworks: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/theanogi/?fref=ts\">Theano G.</a>\u00a0&amp; <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AthinaPappa.FelixFelis/?fref=ts\">Felix Felis</a></small>\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-05 08:32:27", "updated_at": "2018-05-24 14:33:06.436175", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1226, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 75.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17185, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4833, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Great question</b>\n\n<a href=\"/u/atzu\">@Atzu</a>, you ask a great question.

The neighbourhood has been a problematic spot eversince and known for its violence, poverty, unemployment, lack of education and migrational background. Yet the first signs of gentrification are no more to be denied, artists, caf\u00e9s, galleries and real estate speculation continue to increase as well as the hatred of the \"old inhabitants\".

The main idea was, and still is, that hacker culture and the availability of cheap and open but advanced technology (not only software, but hardware and wetware too) can contribute to ideating and providing care services \u2013 at a time Europe badly needs innovation in this domain. Furthermore, services designed and deployed by skilled communities of hackers are likely to be very different from those provided by the state and the private sector. The discussion proved that tackling the issue of community-drive care required a strongly interdisciplinary approach, covering many areas of expertise. We identified the main ones as follows:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Collective intelligence: how can a community function as a knowledge engine?</li>\n\n<li>Domain expertise on care: how can communities interface with the academic debate\u00a0on what constitutes care and how it should be done?</li>\n\n<li>Design: how can we bring state-of-the-art design for sustainability and service design\u00a0practices into designing care provision?</li>\n\n<li>Open hardware: how can rapid prototyping and open hardware platforms be used in\u00a0the participatory design of care services?</li>\n\n<li>Public policy design and evaluation: how can community-driven care services be\u00a0integrated in the highly sensitive, highly regulated landscape of European care provision?</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nThe team adopts a working out loud practice throughout the project and coordinates in an open group. <a href=\"/opencare-research\">Join here.</a>\n\nThis project has received funding from the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 688670\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/4/4893c749d51cf8eac39c34f6f2e751559db219c2.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"126\">\n\n", "created_at": "2015-10-26 10:54:25", "updated_at": "2018-11-22 21:06:15.762714", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 428, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 31.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2405, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 2372, "post_number": 1, "raw": "The unMonastery, has been shortlisted to win 100,000 Euros in a Italian competition called Che Fare.\n\n<h1>So why does\u00a0the Che Fare\u00a0competition\u00a0matter?</h1>\n\n<strong>Because the unMonastery is</strong><span><strong>\u00a0our\u00a0first attempt to collaboratively build the kind of p2p\u00a0infrastructure\u00a0needed </strong>for individuals\u00a0to be able to do meaningful work.

Since the first of the Oslo Accords was signed in 1993, Israeli and Palestinian leaders have held several rounds of negotiations for a final-status peace agreement. The basic premise of these negotiations \u2013 the establishment of a Palestinian state on the West Bank and Gaza in exchange for a comprehensive regional peace between the Arab world and Israel, \u201cland for peace\u201d \u2013 has been compromised, most likely beyond repair.\n\nDuring this period, hundreds of initiatives, supported by international civil society, aimed at advancing the peace process through dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians of various walks of life. Today, peace negotiations are structurally deadlocked but this so-called \u2018peace industry\u2019 continues unabated, with its mandate now refashioned as one of breaking the impasse. There is a growing realization, represented by the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, that the real objective of the \u2018peace industry\u2019 is one of conflict management: maintaining the present equilibrium of limited Palestinian self-rule under overall Israeli control and a manageable level of resistance, for the benefit of the various stakeholders in that arrangement. In other words, that the \u2018peace industry\u2019 is an obstacle to a just solution to the conflict.\n\nWhat are the reasons for this continuous failure? What changes would be required for meaningful negotiations? In the absence of such changes, what are the viable alternatives for pursuing justice and peace in Palestine and Israel? And what is the current state of those alternatives? \n\nCome, listen, ask questions and flesh out some ideas together with other participants during this panel. Omar Shehabi will present a brief history of failed attempts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the role of international law in defining the conflict and its limitations as a basis for resolving it, and the emerging strategies for achieving justice and peace for Israelis and Palestinians beyond the paradigm of the peace process. \n\nWhat Omar brings to the conversation is his experience as a legal adviser with the Palestinian Negotiations Support Project, where he provided counsel to the Palestinian leadership on the international law aspects of final-status negotiations with Israel, and as a legal officer with the United Nations Relief &amp; Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) in Jerusalem. Omar is the director of Palestine Works, a nonprofit organization promoting Palestinian human development by creating high-impact knowledge exchange opportunities. \n\nYou can reach Omar on EdgeRyders at @omar_shehabi.

Arguably, the OSM dataset itself is a major digital asset, cared for by a community.

We could somehow engineer a path from the Piccianello event in May to the September event, in which an open server would be turned over to the community. This would be a teaching resource for the VA; at the same time, the VA could teach people in town how to maintain it, and spread practical knowledge about all things open with the excuse of the server.

Wow! This line would have been a perfect opener for an essay on a topic \u2018My house\u2019 in the school days. But now I am quite concerned about everything I say or imagine about my house. For instance, I am \u2018truly madly deeply\u2019 confused about \u2018is\u2019 or \u2018was\u2019 status of my house. In fact, what determines the \u2018is\u2019 versus \u2018was\u2019 status of anything has become just little more interesting now in the aftermath of the earthquake. If I look at the space where my neighbour\u2019s house once stood, I would say \u2018It was there! Yes, the house was there just yesterday!\u2019. Now, there is nothing but rubbles, left-behind clothes, broken earthen utensils, pieces of copies and books, and unattended dolls of the kids. But, my house still stands nearby and yet, it doesn\u2019t stand as before. So, I am still doing a \u2018research\u2019 on what status I can confer to my house. My findings so far conclude that it is in this slow and steady race of gaining the status of \u2018was\u2019 from \u2018is\u2019. That is the best explanation I can give. Hence, I prefer to keep it this way until my \u2018participant observation\u2019 of the research \u2018The falling house\u2019 concludes something solid. However, I am open to comments in any forms. For now, I just throw in some pages of my \u2018earthquake notes\u2019. I begin this write up with more or less the same version of my opener which is far from any assertions or any propositions derived from a research.\n\nMy house \u2018is or was\u2019 a typical Newari house in a typical Newari settlement in Bhaktapur. Made up of woods, mud and bricks, and gallons of sweats of my ancestors, it stands 5 storeys tall. I don\u2019t remember when it was built. It must be some 50 or more years ago because even my father doesn\u2019t remember much about it. The only thing I remember is that about 10 years ago, we had a major renovation that allowed us to have a bigger roof which offered us a majestic view of the mountains, sun rise and sunset. I loved watching sunsets from the roof of my house. Also, many generations of beautiful flowers blossomed there. My mom often asked me to water them. But I don\u2019t remember when I watered the plants there for the last time. At times, I also practiced my flute lessons there. It used to be cool there, playing some melodies and listening to the birds singing theirs, and the rising sun as a solitary audience. In the evenings, it used to fun teasing the kids on the adjoining roofs, and most of the times, chasing them away. Mom used to bring my \u2018khaja\u2019 there though I always requested her that I would come downstairs for it. With \u2018khaja\u2019 and a cup of coffee, I celebrated my solitude watching the hills and mountains. It was a heaven then.\n\nNow after the earthquake, my mom doesn\u2019t tolerate me going to the roof. In fact, she is still not happy that I decided to accommodate myself in the ground floor of our house. She thinks our house is too risky. So, after days of discusssions and confusions, we decided to rent a room at a neighbor\u2019s newly built \u2018concrete\u2019 house. I stayed in the room for few days because my mom won\u2019t allow me in our house. But one day I shifted to the ground floor of our house. I brought my bed, table and some books from my room which is in the third floor of our house. We also managed a make-shift kitchen in the ground floor. We were gradually settling down.\n\nBut time and again, I climb the wooden stairs to check stuffs upstairs. And in that process, I would often end up in the roof. When my mom sees me there, she won\u2019t stop shouting at me until I climb down. Now I do not climb to the roof to watch the sunsets. Neither do I need to water the plants because they have died long before. Nor can I imagine playing flute there. Nor are there any kids on the adjoining roofs. Yet, I can not stop myself from being there just to feel what it used to be like before. I definitely miss being there. But I know its quite risky there. As I climb the wooden stairs, I feel the floor shake. I am afraid, of course! I know a small aftershock can do much damage. Yet, something pulls me. It\u2019s more than the physical space at the roof that attracts me. It\u2019s the memories associated with me being there.\n\nWhat I see from my roof now is the collapsed houses of my neighbors and the tarpaulin-covered walls of the houses waiting for their fate. At least three houses adjoining our house collapsed during the earthquake. My neighbor\u2019s house which shares a common wall with our house is in the verge of collapse. Fearing the worst case scenario that the house might collapse and hurt pedestrians, my neighbor decided to take it down. That means our own house awaits it fate. It\u2019s just the matter of time. Hence, my mom has insisted on bringing everything to the room that we have rented. Therefore, my house might be vacant in few days or months, but it will always carry a scar left behind by an irreparable destruction of spaces that molded so contentedly in our memories that every time we pass through those empty spaces, absence of some familiar forms eludes the lost minds to believe on the phoenix story with a hope that those spaces will be retained soon. But houses do not rise so often, unless in our memories. Might be we have better things replacing those empty spaces in our memories.\n\n<h2>I felt a shock thousands of miles away</h2>\n\nI was thousand miles away on that \u2018black\u2019 day when a number of houses in my neighborhood collapsed and left my house fragile. I was attending a conference in Cyprus when the facebook pages were overloaded with statuses related to the disaster in my home country. The first status I encountered seemed more like a prank than an update: \u2018Dharahara is gone\u2019. Familiar with some similar pranks in the past, I thought it was just another one until images of destructions of roads, temples, and the Dharahara were rampant in the pages. I sat down helpless in a chair in that conference hall: confused and worried, and unsure what I was supposed to do. The only thing I could do then was to leave the conference hall. Outside, everything was normal. The sun was bright and a street musician was playing some familiar tunes little far away. Yet, I was caught by a storm that was thousands of miles away from me.\n\nI made several attempts to contact my family and friends. But everything seemed blown away by the storm. Without hearing anything from my family, I was getting more and more worried. I wanted to be back in home as soon as possible. Again, there were rumors that the only international airport might have been damaged too. Some members of the organizers of the conference spotted me and by then, they were all aware of the situation back here. They asked if I was fine, and if my family was OK? I had no answer for either of the questions. I just requested them if I could catch a plane in a day or two. Inside the conference hall, people were discussing how they could bring \u2018peace\u2019 in the world while I was fighting my own war against the distance and the time. I knew I won\u2019t be able to get a flight any sooner than a couple of days.\n\nThat day, I spent almost all my time trying to contact my family, relatives and friends.\n\nThree days later, I finally got a flight back to Kathmandu. It must have been the most-awaited flight of my life. I wished the plane could take me to my home straight away. In Dubai transit, I had to wait for 10 hours more than the prescheduled transit hours. We were told that flights to Kathmandu have been delayed by hours. During that long wait, I was in company of a number of other Nepalese who were waiting there to board the same flight. We had different stories, but one common concern: family in the earthquake-hit country. Some were returning to attend the funerals of their family members who died in the earthquake. Many were on their holiday breaks from the jobs, and their holiday mood was just ruined by the earthquake.\n\nWhen the plane took off from the Dubai airport, another news heightened our impatience. The news was about the the heavy air traffic in the Kathmandu airport packed by the flights of international missions bringing the relief materials. So, we were prepared to have a prolonged flight duration. Well, I was less concerned about it. I just needed to land there sooner or later. On my adjoining seat was a foreigner who had come for some relief mission. He seemed interested in conversing with me. But I was getting so impatient about reaching home that I hardly seemed to notice. As we entered the sky above the Kathmandu valley, the damage brought by the earthquake became more apparent. A rainbow of blue, black, orange and yellow tents seemed to have dispersed all over the valley floor. Rain seemed an inseparable company too.\n\n<h2>An awakening!</h2>\n\nIt was a big relief meeting my family and finding them safe. They were staying with neighbors in a temporary tent in an open space. It was almost dark then. Still, I went to inspect damages incurred by the earthquake in my house. On the way, I saw a number of collapsed buildings. The electricity was down and there were cables scattered all over the streets. The telephone network was down too. When I reached my home, the cracks on the outer face made up of the bricks and mud clearly suggested the intensity of damages both inside and outside. As I entered the building, there were cracks almost everywhere. I couldn\u2019t climb up to the roof.\n\nI came to my house next day. The inner structures of the building suffered more damage than outside. A neighbor\u2019s house suffered a similar fate. A number of other houses in the neighborhood had already collapsed. Some of them had started to bring down the remaining structures and search for their belongings. I joined a group of men who were helping a family in searching their belongings in the rubbles. The same activity continued over a week. My engagement in such activities led me to a number of questions that made me reflect over many thoughts. I could feel the presence of a silent empathy among all the people who came together to help a family in need. Also, I was pondering over what led to people to organize themselves and act collectively in such scenario. No one was leading the act, nor did anyone seem to instruct others. Sometimes, I just feel that we have a leader inside every one of us. We just need an awakening. \u00a0\n\nThe earthquake has been an awakening for many sleeping souls. Never before had I felt so much responsible for my family. While I was quite occupied in voluntary works outside, I was often stuck between my responsibilities within home and urgencies to extend help outside. Within our family, we had a major decision to make on whether to accommodate ourselves in the ground floor of our house or to find rooms outside in \u2018safe\u2019 places. According to my mom, our house is not safe at all. So, we needed to find \u2018safe\u2019 places outside. But the contestations over which place is safe and which is not remained largely unattended. Our discussions often ended with a decision to accommodate ourselves in the ground floor and a rented room in a neighbor\u2019s house for some time unless we find a better alternative. It must been have been almost a month after the earthquake by then. Perhaps it was time to move on. And, amidst the frequent aftershocks, we wanted to believe that things were gradually being normal.\n\nWhen I said \u2018Things were gradually getting normal\u2026..\u2019, I later realized that it was too early to make that statement. I had not really understood what was going on in my family and other families in my neighborhood. For instance, I had taken my mom\u2019s fear as a normal reaction to the quake. Only later did I realize that my mom was going through some serious psychological impacts of the disaster. Even during minor aftershocks, mom started to panic. Even while having dinner, her eyes remained glued to the water pouch that we had hung on the ceiling that acted as an indicator of a tremor. I started to realize, might be I was too insensitive while arguing against my mom\u2019s insistence on renting a room or a flat in safe place. My mom and sister were in home when the major quakes hit. I was not in home in both occasions. I haven't yet felt what they have gone through. Also, my mom was getting older. She had been suffering with this joint pain for long. I could not realize that she won\u2019t be able to run as fast as me when she has to during a quake. I repented on my ignorance about my mom\u2019s concerns. There might be many other concerns of my mom or of my dad or my sister that I remained so ignorant about. This earthquake was an awakening for me. Might be I was misled by other concerns that overshadowed the concerns of my family. Was I running too fast that I just missed everything around me?\n\nI had resumed my work much earlier. Every time I felt an aftershock at my workplace, even a minor one, I grew more concerns about my family, my home. I started getting worried if my mom is alright. Did she move out of the house on time? Even till date, a small tremor, or a feeling that aftershocks might occur, haunts me. The fear is not limited to the loss of a house. The fear is more of a loss of our attachments with the house, our memories of moments with our family in the house. We often forget that a house grows with us. Might be it gets older too.\n\nI know I have delved far beyond what the topic demands. In fact, I was too late in realizing that this write-up had a specific question. But, I have fewer concerns about any kind of question in this particular period of time. What \u2018progress\u2019 means for me, or what \u2018leadership\u2019 means to whom? In fact, I have started to believe that these \u2018concepts\u2019 have different meanings for different people and in different occasions they manifest contextual understandings.\n\n\u00a0For my mom, and for our family, we are fixing a kitchen in our ground floor from scratches. It\u2019s about fixing that gas line, it\u2019s about fixing that sink, and it\u2019s about getting good drinking water for the family. For my parents, it\u2019s about maintaining ties with the neighbors who have moved away far from our house. In fact, many people have been compelled to move away from their original places and pushed away to unfamiliar places. With change in the locations, there are emotional impacts, psychological impacts, and immeasurable loss of intimacy with both people and place. What does it mean to \u2018organize ourselves\u2019 or \u2018progress\u2019 in such cases?\n\nFew days ago I met a friend who had a very compelling story to share. He has a small kid whom I had met in few occasions. He shared that his kid was having a difficult time adjusting to new place and people.\n\nRecently, I had visited Bungamati where some friends were helping the local people to build temporary shelters in an open field. I spent some time listening their stories of how they escaped the disaster. They are still frightened of the uncertainities that lie ahead.\n\nI joined a group of friends to perform in a music program for children in one of the relief camps in Kathmandu. The music program and other activities provided a liminal space for the children to forget the trauma. But when the music stops and we stop dancing, we are back in the real world beyond that liminal space. How can we keep the music alive beyond those liminal spaces?\n\nIn these contexts, how can we \u2018organize\u2019 ourselves? How do we define \u2018leadership\u2019 ? For me, its about beginning from self. First, I need to organize myself. I need to listen to myself. I need to listen to my family, to people around. I need to have that patience to hear their stories and to walk in their shoes. Therefore, I listened to my mom. And, never before I did feel my mom\u2019s pain in such depth. So, if organizing \u2018ourselves\u2019 mean listening to the people sharing their stories, their sufferings, I am on for it. But not just for the sake of listening. Listen to them as if you are listening to your mother sharing her pain. Help someone as if you are helping your mother set up a kitchen for your first meal after the earthquake. Listen to your neighbors, help them console their 3-year-old grandson to make him understand why they have shifted to a \u2018new house\u2019.\n\nAnd what does \u2018leadership\u2019 mean? I don\u2019t know, frankly enough! For me, there is a leader in every one of us. We didn\u2019t need any leader to guide us when we were helping a family in our neighborhood searching for their belongings in their collapsed house. Why can\u2019t a \u2018purpose\u2019 and \u2018common experiences\u2019 guide us? Our willingness to help others and share our efforts for someone\u2019s happiness might be more encouraging than any kind of so-called \u2018leaders\u2019 in the world. Moreover, who do we need to lead? May be, sometimes, it\u2019s our own ignorance that seeks a birth of a leader within ourselves. May be, organizing ourselves and leading ourselves might mean to create beautiful structures in those empty spaces left behind by our past.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-20 18:43:36", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 14:44:58.380067", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 3157, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 25.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 541, "user_id": 3293, "topic_id": 508, "post_number": 1, "raw": "-----------------------\n\nSummary ENG + FR\n\nL'atelier a g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 beaucoup de contenu que vous pouvez retrouver ici-bas. Mais pour ceux qui se focalisent avant tout sur les r\u00e9sultats, nous avons regroup\u00e9 les points les plus importants ici :\n\n1. Tout le monde souhaite plus de collaboration, mais a des difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 rendre cela concret.\n\nApr\u00e8s la premi\u00e8re s\u00e9rie de discussions, nous avons not\u00e9 que les organisations de toute sorte sont pr\u00eates \u00e0 devenir plus collaboratives, mais qu'elles manquent d'outils pour y arriver \u00e9tape par \u00e9tape. Elles sont toutes conscientes de la force du travail collectif, mais n'ont jamais eu de succ\u00e8s sur le long terme. Dans cet atelier, nous avons essay\u00e9 de trouver ce qui \u00e9tait important \u00e0 r\u00e9ussir pour les collaborations, et ainsi nous en venons au deuxi\u00e8me point :\n\n2. Comment cr\u00e9ons-nous de la Confiance entre organisations inconnues, mais avec le m\u00eame genre de pens\u00e9e ?\n\nNous avons eu un test grandeur nature : une quinzaine d'organisations, partageant des valeurs communes et dispos\u00e9es \u00e0 collaborer et apprendre les unes des autres, mais qui venaient \u00e0 peine de se rencontrer. Apr\u00e8s d'autres d\u00e9bats, nous avons r\u00e9alis\u00e9 que la confiance \u00e9tait le principal probl\u00e8me. Nous avons donc essay\u00e9 d\u2019encadrer la cr\u00e9ation de confiance en nous avons constat\u00e9 que c\u2019\u00e9tait mieux d\u2019avoir des petits projets entre les diff\u00e9rents groupes   afin de cr\u00e9er des liens entre les personnes. Ces projets peuvent \u00eatre  des petits projets r\u00e9alisables en quelques minutes ou une heure. A partir de l\u00e0 chaque pas suivant deviens une tache  plus complexe que la pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente pour cr\u00e9er ainsi un lien plus fort.\n\n<div>\n\n3.   Donner de perspectives alternatives  aux soins nous fait r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir sur notre propre structure de soins.\n\nFinalement nous avions un de participants  qui nous a aid\u00e9s \u00e0 penser out of the box d\u2019une mani\u00e8re perturbatrice. C\u2019\u00e9tait un refugi\u00e9e Syrien  qui a d\u00fb  reporter ses \u00e9tudes de m\u00e9dicine pour fuir du pays et qui nous a donner  beaucoup des choses \u00e0 r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir. Il nous voyait comme  des \u00ab boxpeople \u00bb , vivant dans une bulle et pla\u00e7ant  des autres gens dans des bulles. Les personnes \u00e2g\u00e9es, les sans-abri, les personnes avec des maladies psychologiques, etc. ; ils sont tous plac\u00e9s en dehors de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\n\nIl explique qu\u2019en Syrie ils n\u2019avaient peut-\u00eatre pas un syst\u00e8me de soins de sant\u00e9 efficace, mais  il est beaucoup plus humain. Ceci nous a fait penser  sur la fa\u00e7on comment nous voyons les soins en Europe. C\u2019est aussi lui qui nous a signal\u00e9 sur le probl\u00e8me de confiance qui est cr\u00e9\u00e9 ici dans l\u2019ouest.\n\n</div>\n\n-------\n\nThe Workshop gave us a lot of content that you can find here. But for those who are result oriented we compiled the most important knowledge bubbels here. \n\n1.    Everybody is in search of collaboration solutions, but have difficulties realizing them.\n\nAfter the first round of discussions we noticed that all kind of organizations are ready to become more collaborative, but they are missing the step-by-step tools to achieve this. They all are conscious about the power of collaboration, but have never had successful long lasting experiences. The goal of this workshop was to find the key elements to make a collaborative initiative succeed, this leads us to the second point.\n\n2.    How do we create trust between unbeknown organizations that share the same way of thinking?\n\nWe had a great test case: around 15 organizations that came together for the first time, all sharing the same ideas and willing to collaborate to learn from each other. After a lot of discussions we discovered trust was the main issue.  So we tried to frame how trust is built and concluded that we needed to start with small projects with each other, these projects don\u2019t need to be longer  than a couple of minutes/hours, this way people start to bond. After that each following project can become more complex to create a stronger bodn between the participants.  We listed a couple of thing each would do, to immidiate have a Proof Of Concept.\n\n3. Giving other perspectives of care makes us think about our own caretaking structure\n\nFinally we had one person that helped think out of the box in a really disruptive way. He was a Syrian refugee that had to postpone his medical studies/Ph.D.  To flee the country and gave us a lot of material to think about. He saw us as 'boxpeople', living in a bubble and putting others in bubbles. Elderly, homeless people, psychological ill are all given a space outside society. They maybe didn't have the most efficient healthcare system, but he explained it was much more humane. It made us think a lot about how we see care in the west. He was also the person that pointed out the problem of trust we create in the west.\n\n-----------------------\n\n \n\nLast Saturday we hosted a quit successful workshop in Brussels around the Open &amp; Care thematic with local participants and workers of the designated field. We had a set up loosely based on the Berlin workshop and will go deeper into the methodology, the preparation, the participants and outcome in the following text. This article is a more organized version of <a href=\"https://titanpad.com/KRlyZXvSW6\">the thinkpad</a> we put online at the workshop and where people could transcribe what was being said.\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\"><strong>Preparation</strong></h2>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Reaching out\n\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha;\">\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/kay79fljblycy0s/Dutch.docx?dl=0\">Dutch</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/30ens5ljqq9xjmj/French.docx?dl=0\">French</a> <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/75wbo2yut2s5cij/Targeted%20invitation%20to%20interviews.docx?dl=0\">&amp; English invitations</a></li>\n\n</ol></li>\n\n</ol>\n\nIn the beginning of the preparation of the workshop I reached out to my network of socially involved people who could have interesting stories to add to the platform. It was sometime difficult to explain them the whole concept through mail, so I decided to meet the people who wanted more information. This gave me the following <a href=\"https://metamaps.cc/maps/2175\">graphical content</a>. Without surprise the most active and responsive people came from the makers and changemakers scene. They immediately connected to the higher goal and activated their network. The least responsive network where the politicians, coming back from their annual non-active period it was difficult to activate them. Every attempt ended up in a dead end.\n\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha;\">\n\n<li><a href=\"/t/generating-a-community-around-the-workshop/5840\">How to create the community</a></li>\n\n</ol>\n\nBut after a couple of weeks building up a community, a moment of panic occurred. The people where reacting positively towards the workshop, but hesitated to get more involved. The confirmed list of people was stagnating, so I opened a debate on the Edgeryders platform to see how we can resolve that issue. After getting some clarifications from the team that organized the <a href=\"/t/after-thessaloniki-tips-information-and-ideas/5841\">Greek workshop</a> and some tips from people that organized a lot of workshops i changed my method and opened up with a more general approach through mailing lists and facebook groups. The combination of both locally anchored contacts and general presentations of the workshop filled the last gaps. We had 28 confirmed people and around 40 interested contacts in a mailing list.\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>One on One discussions / Text submissions</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nBefore the workshop occurred this where the people wanting to start already a conversation on their work around social and medical care.

The house is being renovated and invented by a team of volunteers to become a hub for social, cultural and technological innovators.  Each of the core members took a task to facilitate the workshop. Maria found a socially involved catering service, Sigried arranged the space to be workshop ready, Toha was responsible for the photographical documentation and Cecile prepared everything so the outcome would be documented in a nice visual style by using Toha\u2019s skills and the templates. Yannick participated and worked as a transcriber at the workshop\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a8274cc1cd183a4685cc4864e2661debcaeefe13.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\">\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\"><strong>Methodology</strong></h2>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/hk8g08dcji8fpkn/OAC%20journal.pdf?dl=0\">Berlin Workshop</a></li>\n\n</ol>\n\nWe based ourselves on the Berlin workshop that was filled with interesting methods to actively think about care issues in Belgium.

Mission is to support members to create self-sustaining projects.\n\nEdgeryders creates tools to manage all the content created by the 3500 members. Open ethnographic tools for example uses the data to see what discussions are well connected. \n\nThe big question that is asked as a red line throughout the day: Can healthcare systems work like Wikipedia, StackOverflow or other massively coordinated systems with very limited control and overhead?\n\nTwo mechanisms at stake:\n\n 1) self selection: individuals get involved in something because they want to, and contribute because they want to\n\n 2) social networks: people and groups which move fluidly across organisations and shaping the norms as they wish \n\nCase studies of how people access community care:\n\n- <a href=\"/t/care-by-communities-greeces-shadow-zero-cash-health-care-system/4880\">Clinics in Greece </a>\n\n- <a href=\"/t/creating-a-compassionate-alternative-to-911/695\">Alternative to 911 in the US</a>\n\nWhat is op3ncare in short:\n\n- A place where we can share stories about care\n\n- Where you can find people to support projects\n\n- Where you can create solutions without being in the same place\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Learning From Experience</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nAfter the general introduction, the participants are asked to be devided into groups of maximum four people where they will discuss using a template about their projects. Each of them gets 10 minutes to introduce him or herself while somebody else takes notes and a third person ask questions and listens carefully.\n\nYou can find the note of each of those roundtables here, some of them are in French and other in English. It is written by the participants and wasn\u2019t cleaned up.\n\n<a href=\"/t/openandchange-workshop-documentation-brussels-listening-triads/5886\">Discussions</a>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Plenary</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nBefore the lunch we came together for an hour and shared what was remarkable about each other stories. Here you can find some of the insights\n\n<strong>Winnie:</strong> he noticed that every project has some community in it, but communities experience different ways of being in the world, different incentives for being in a community.\n\n<strong>Laurent</strong>: 3 different projects, which have something in common, with people being excluded by the system because they are poor or sick. Empowerment for these populations is at the core of each project. Behind each there is a diagnosis of how the excluded population can have lost access to institutional support. If something is possible, it is on the edge, where people can regain access to their lives. \n\n<strong>Lotfi:</strong> Nous \u00e9tions trois entit\u00e9s, je suis avec Selvi, nous avons eu une maison de repos, Xander travaille avec des enfants autiste, Alkasem, il esp\u00e8re qu'il pourrait faire son m\u00e9tier de m\u00e9decin. On a parl\u00e9 d'interg\u00e9n\u00e9rationnel, comment cr\u00e9er des mini soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ou il y a des \u00e9change. Au del\u00e0 d'un certain \u00e2ge: il y a pas de support. Alkasem a fait la parall\u00e8le de comment le syst\u00e8me de soin ce passe en moyen orient, une culture musulman de l'entraide. On impose de donner de l'argent au pauvre. Tout le monde vie ici dans sa bulle, il n\u2019y a pas de transversalit\u00e9. \n\n<strong>Xander: </strong> the community aspect is really important, the human is seen as a kind of predator, humans are also caring beings. \n\n<strong>Alkasem:</strong> i have question to all of you: where are the families of the homeless people? I never saw anyone homeless in Syria, or living on a mattress. How did it happen? Some of the participants responded later on: \n\n<ul>\n\n<li>the core family concept has been broken down - after uni and growing up you have to carry yourself; so there is no glue which keeps family together</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>in North Africa systems are weak -so there has always been a cultural support; whereas in the West the system is supposed to take care of everything</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Here (in the West) you are free, but alone!</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\"Free, but alone.\" vs. \"Belonging, but coerced\" Comparing systems-based  vs. family-based cultures of care <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alberto_cottica/status/779632492940783618\">(twitter link)</a></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7674e81184c199abbea3a75d821e62720183a87a.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\">\n\n<strong>Jean:</strong> There is a desire of using new ways of technology to organize his place within the society je cherche a me socialiser, trouver une occupation profitable, mais je voudrais rester dans la marginalit\u00e9. Find a meaning in his life, but stay at the edge of society. \n\n<strong>Claire</strong>: I want to create something can provide something that can give help to each other. It is very complicated to arrive there. With Laurent, Sophie, we have a point of connection, but we need to know each other better. I worked for several years around the project of self-care. I want to do something very new. We are creating to work on a project on different levels in December with Laurent, but it is really difficult to find what is most needed: partnership and collaboration. \n\n<strong>Adeline:</strong> Everybody here came with a need, to find ways to come up with a solution, tous le monde est venue avec un besoin, elle esp\u00e8re aider \u00e0 trouver une solution. \n\n<strong>Gilles:</strong> Strongly believes in open source and data sharing solutions - everyone is looking for someone who can help them with a solution eg. to develop a website to help the project moving. \n\n<strong>Loic:</strong> The core needs he noticed in others is to learn information about what others are doing, get information about collaborations; and second, the need for visibility. Personally he has come here for housing project, but Winnie's story is useful to hear also professionally.\n\n<strong>Yannick:</strong> was in conversation with Kacim,Lotfi - the intergenerational interactions need to be looked into, because it is in only specific circumstances that we spend time together eg living in a house with my grandmother and the positive outcomes which came from that. \n\n            <strong>SIDENOTE: Multiple times in the discussion a same metaphor that was introduced by Alkasem was used by the participants. He noted that our western society made us all \u2018boxpeople\u2019. He finds it so strange that we are all living next to each other, but that we aren\u2019t interacting better. We put old people in a home and (mentally) sick people in a closed environment. I found that metaphor really strong and something to use when we are trying to connect multiple organizations. </strong>\n\n<strong>Question time</strong>\n\nAfter giving everybody the chance to share their view on the received input we gave everybody 5 minutes the time transcribe it in a question they wanted to solve in the second part of the day. These are the questions that came up:\n\n- How can communities become more visible and members interact more easily?\n\n- How do you make the actions of the community visible to the individuals?\n\n- How do you make individuals' actions more visible to the community?\n\n- How can we help individuals be independent from official caring services?\n\n- How do we invite more people to be part of the process and disseminate the documentation?\n\n- How can we find the right balance between keeping the effectiveness of the box with still being able to go out of the box/\n\n- What is the metaphor of what we are trying to do? (Stefanos) helps understand complicated things without \n\n- How do you build connectivity into each initiative or do you want connectivity only between initiative? If we all want to coordinate, what amount of time/ effort/ resources can we each put into learning to coordinate?\n\n- How could we open the debate about the strength of intergenerational care. \n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/399d0d98b64c23b01a2e828687a2d2d77ce7a18b.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\">\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Presentation Projects</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nSome of the participants prepared a presentation of their projects. Three of them where <strong>DoucheFlux</strong>, <strong>Belgium Designers Council</strong> and <strong>Habitats 123: A testcase of alternative housing</strong>. A summary can be found here:\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">Laurent d'Ursel / DoucheFLUX:</h3>\n\n4 years old project, we are opening a huge house to help people out of the marge, we will have 20 showers, 150 lockers, medical service, laundries, a pharmecy, and other needed services for this part of people, which is missing \n\nSecond pillar is activities: DoucheFlux is 50m2 at the moment, so we work at other spaces, we make activities that promote self esteem for these people, they are totally embedded in the system, they can't escape what is happening about them, they find it difficult to get further, so their mechanism is that they just stop trying, because they don't feel empowered anymore\n\nDoucheflux helps them to get more self-esteem, but it is difficult because sometimes it feel that we are infantilizing them, and if you do that mistake they don't come anymore\n\nThe challenge: another way to make social work, so not only people that studied for the social sector. To take the social dream out of the social field and bring it to other fields. Because they are fed up of all the social help, they just want a happy life: it is not only important to have an home, but also to create great moments. <strong>To create equal relationships. break racism against the poor. </strong>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">Rozina / Business Imporvements Design Belgium</h3>\n\nLiving in Bxl for 15 years, an interior designer coming from a corporate background working in the hospitality business. She started her own design company and got more involved in strategic design thinking - now involved with the Belgium Design Thinking. Projects to make the sports clubs more inclusive because they were closed for refugees; also hardly accessible by children with special needs. So with other people they pushed for inclusivity and speaking to the Belgium Football Union, but also preparing a strategy for the next few years.\n\nBusiness Improvements Design Belgium (BIDs): they are about creating a new geographical zone and linking community businesses to it, ideal for private - public partnerships.\n\nShe is lobbying for BIDs and wants to see where stakeholders can meet in the middle; seems idealistic especially since she's not from here.\n\nHas seen encouraging results after talking to her mayor, and right now she's trying to create a youth platform for citizenship and sports - an IDEO design type of commune. \n\nWhat changed after the football? <strong>People understood there is a strategy and structure, so they get a sense of belonging. If everybody contributes something, we become as a community.We educate the value of communication, transparency...</strong>\n\nRozina would need help to connect with people working hands on with special needs populations. \n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5f06bf7675ae198544e232fa0109178b2507ea88.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\">\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">Loic / Right to Housing in Brussels</h3>\n\nPreviously office building occupied by the French community which had been vacant for 15 years. Groups of squatters moved in and made a deal with the owner to run different workshops - bike fixing, woodwork, IT etc.\n\nSome interesting facts from his paper:\n\n-social housing in Bxl is much lower, 7 % compared to the 27% in the Netherlands\n\n-7 % of houses totally empty\n\n-1 000 000 sq metres of unused office space: 40% of empty offices have been empty for 7 years\n\nFrom squatting to a participatory process -  a public owned space (Community Francais) but community managed: from refugees to Irish artists to Flemish doctor students. Half the people (of 60) don't have any revenues, and everyone contributes a little - from 60 eur a month to approx. 150.  <strong>In Belgium it is possible to have a temporary legal occupation for an office, so you can live in an office space!</strong>\n\nIt's an office building, which means people can change the layout easily.\n\nDifference between buildings for profit and the testcase of 123:\n\nProfit building is praised for being open while just having 7% of their space being used for community. 123 has almost 50% of community used space, but because of their 'illegal' status it isn't praised.\n\nLoic showed a detailed distribution of the types of spaces - at each floor you'd have facilities, workshops, library + distribution of private and communal space. \n\n<strong>Important detail: Stairs instead of working elevators as a social control mechanism.</strong>\n\nLoic is trying to give more visibility to housing solutions - it's not easy, take good contact with the owner! <strong>First you squad, then you talk.</strong>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Collaboration Mosaic</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nNow it is time to get into the concrete part of the workshop. Therefor everybody is put again into groups of maximum four people and asked to choose one of the skill cards on the table. From there they will explain why they chose that card and what skills they want to bring. Here are the skills we find in our most helpful people\n\n<strong>Winnie:</strong>\n\n- DIY and generally fixing things yourself\n\n- Mental support\n\n- Getting weird things you wouldn't normally find yourself\n\n- A delivery van\n\n- Someone to do a project with\n\n<strong>Jean:</strong>\n\n- Can discuss Existential problem\n\n- Commercial things and buying decisions\n\n<strong>Claire:</strong>\n\n- Making a conference atelier du capitalisme\n\n- Support people who are more fragile\n\n- Set up an association\n\n<strong>Marie Ange:</strong>\n\n- Linking Activities\n\n- Mental/ moral support\n\n- Social contacts\n\n<strong>Rozina:</strong>\n\n- Business\n\n- Experience and wisdom\n\n- Out-of-the-box thinking\n\n- Empathy\n\n- Government administration\n\n- Cultural awareness\n\n<strong>Adeline</strong>\n\n- Active listening and sensibility\n\n- Wisdom and pragmatism\n\n- Do it yourself, engineering as a way of seeing the world\n\n- Cars \n\n<strong>Lotfi</strong>\n\n- Fundraising and financial subsidies \n\n- Medical technical knowledge\n\n- Business modeling\n\n- Administration\n\n<strong>Gilles</strong>\n\n- Administration\n\n- Legal advice\n\n- Social business modeling\n\n- The WHY\n\n- Sharing economy\n\n- Scientific dieticians\n\n<strong>Xander</strong>\n\n- Friendship\n\n- Philosophy\n\n- Playing music\n\n- Word stuff\n\n<strong>Stefanos</strong>\n\n- Order/ being orderly \n\n- Moral support and push to go forward and not backwards\n\n- Fun\n\n- The occasional hug\n\n<strong>SIDENOTE 2: Alkasem was again the most disruptive thinker in the group and gave us a lot to think. For him, everything moves around friendship. He has the feeling that a lot of people in western society start of with mistrust. If you start with mistrust it is difficult to create trust. And without trust no skill can be shared. This intervention of him started a discussion about the meaning of trust and how we can build that.</strong>\n\n\u2018Trust is an enabler to use the resources. How can that be created inside an eclectic group like this?\u2019,asked Yannick.  For Claire it is a text and rules of engagement and a clear path of conflict resolution, and a way to learn to treat each other better. \n\nWinnie reacted that your own people's trust is a constant, but gaining the network's trust is more difficult.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e030b2d5f1846f06ed5dd231aab82dba31cdaf54.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\">\n\nNadia tried to made a synthesis of the discussion\n\n1) Working trust is very different from social trust; and there needs to be a boundary. \n\n2) What also worked for her is deciding to work on even a small project.\n\n3) A story that binds us together - understanding how our different activities are \n\n4) Documentation: what does it mean? for us it has been in writing.\n\nFinding each other strengths and weaknesses by organizing small events with each other, and beginning with things that don't have something big at stake. Because then we can learn about each other. The importance of documentation in building trust: Leaving a story behind that people can follow.\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Trust Exercise</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nWhen the discussion was coming to an end we all felt we had got a lot of information and the workshop was going to close. So Nadia came up with a good idea to end the workshop with something concrete. We all felt that one of the biggest issues in care is that we live to much on our own island and that if we want to make care better we need to share and collaborate. But to collaborate we need to create trust. So this exercise was given to every participant and will hopefully end up in solidifying the care network in Belgium. The following question was asked:\n\nWhat can i bring to another organization, that also better myself as a person and is easily realizable?\n\n- Loic wanting to work with the firm of Winnie\n\n- Yannick giving his game about intergeneralisation idea to Lotfi and Selvi\n\n- Marie-Ange wants to give information to Lotfi and Selvi also\n\n\u2026\n\n<strong>Nadia Suggestion: meet in one month: Back in Huis VDH. We will invite new people to continue the conversation and structure the informal and formal networks of care. </strong>\n\n<strong>\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/4/4796979c813ed4c73bcac0af936d491d1ba8d2dc.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\">\n\n</strong>\n\nI would like to thank all the participants for this awesome day we spend reshaping care on a local level. I hope this is the start of something lasting. We invite all interested people and participants to fill this FrameADate link so we can organize the next gathering.

It requires collective action. That is why we decided social innovation deserves a fixed space in Tbilisi. A space for joint events, networking, co-working and co-creation. We wanted to have a place where we could hold regular community meetings. A place where social entrepreneurs could showcase their achievements, meet potential partners and network among like-minded people. We also wanted to increase the number of women and youth involved in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). And create opportunities for talented children and youth from all regions of Georgia through role modeling, e-learning and mentoring. A whole lot, as you can see.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/8/87a584fc34696f60cee878de975011881ba715b1.jpg\" width=\"665\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\nHowever, it did not go all as planned.\n\nSince last year we've had several different meetings. And we realized if we wanted to make this happen, we needed an actual space. To see what costs would be needed to realize it. A member of our group (Remi) told us about the National Scientific Library.\n\n<blockquote class=\"content-citation\" style=\"\">\n\nRemi: \u201cI met Irakli Garibashvili, the director of the National Scientific Library of Georgia, at the monthly meeting of Internations of January 26th, 2014. We stayed in touch discussing various possible initiatives since then. Irakli and Nino Pavliashvili had always shown great interest in attracting people to the library, be them users, visitors, etc. to bring life to what was obviously an underused and underfunded institution with a great potential, historical significance of the building, space available.\u201d\n\n</blockquote>\n\nAnd so the idea was born to host the SIH in the library.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/35669efc6d541ce60677be51a6a6d9afe749da75.jpg\" width=\"665\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\nUnfortunately, what unfolded next, was that that the library received a large sum of money to renovate, being unable to host SIH anymore.\n\n<blockquote class=\"content-citation\" style=\"\">\n\nRemi: \u201cIn December 2014, if I remember well, Irakli told me that the library had just received the promise of an unexpected and unexpectedly large grant from the government for its renovation (external facades + some infrastructure). This was the start of a new dynamics where the library could start planning for a brighter future and, the way I see it, could \"jump on the bandwagon\" of that worldwide movement of libraries currently redefining their role and purpose in societies everywhere in this era of the Internet &amp; mobile communications. A wonderful development for Irakli and Nino, as well as for the library's staff. We had a meeting about the Social Innovation Hub idea during which it appeared that the Social Innovation Hub would not as a whole fit the vision the \"new\" library. My idea now is that SIH finds the space it needs elsewhere but have a \"Social Innovation Hub Wall\" on display at the library to promote its activities.\u201d\n\n</blockquote>\n\nOne reason, as I understood mostly, was that the library was unable to give the organizations a permanent (1 year, 5 year) lease for the place. We would still be able to use it, but not with that guarantee. Unfortunately for the NGOs involved, a contract is an absolute necessity.\n\nBut, luckily, Khatuna (UNDP) attended the meeting where it became clear SIH could not be hosted at the library, and realized that the library perhaps needed support in their future developments. So she came up with the idea to organize a co-creation workshop at the library to redesign the user space.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b14c44a614bef465dee5bdbf4362f8229d422c28.jpg\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\nAnd so the UNDO and the Public Service Development Agency's (PSDA) Innovative Service Lab, organized a workshop for the National Scientific Library to redesign its services.\n\nMariam Tabatadze, senior specialist at the research and development department of the PSDA, told me Khatuna had approached them to work together on it.\n\n<blockquote class=\"content-citation\" style=\"\">\n\nMariam: \u201cThe library team is quite progressive and open minded. They wanted to include ways in which the library could become more modern and dynamic. And use the funds they would get in a way that would turn more people towards the library. And the PSDA works exactly on these kind of problems. We decided on a co-designing workshop in order to come with ideas from potential users of the library.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n</blockquote>\n\nThe workshop participants also looked at the building, to create a user-friendly and accessible library system for everyone.\n\nIn order to redesign the library, we needed creative people with problem-solving skills. So a call went out to involve the community.\n\n<blockquote class=\"content-citation\" style=\"\">\n\nRemi: \u201cI was greatly impressed by the work of the organizers. The methodology hinged on teamwork exercises accessible to all (easy to understand by anyone). But also the public, widely different people who looked genuinely interested to contribute. The respect of younger ones for the older generation was notable for me, a Westerner. And the atmosphere during the workshop was great. Collective work, excellent atmosphere. I remember thinking that what I was seeing definitely felt encouraging for the future of the country.\u201d\n\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c236547bbf5b0b728f5989261cef86e6c7242f1d.jpg\" width=\"665\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\nThe Social Innovation Hub will get back together after the summer to talk about future possibilities.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Who's involved: Who is in the team? Roles and responsibilities? Skillsets</h3>\n\nThe team basically consists of <a href=\"http://elva.org/\">Elva</a>, <a href=\"/u/remi\">@remi</a>\u00a0Boisonnais - <a href=\"http://cospot.ge/\">CospoT</a>, <a href=\"/user/5634\">@ericnbarrett</a>\u00a0- <a href=\"http://www.jumpstart.ge/en\">Jumpstart</a>, <a href=\"/u/boris\">@Boris</a>\u00a0- <a href=\"http://wehelp.ge/\">WeHelp</a>, <a href=\"/u/khatuna\">@Khatuna</a>\u00a0- UNDP, Caroline Sutcliffe - <a href=\"http://chai-khana.org/en\">Chaikhana</a>, David Khosroshvili \u2013 <a href=\"http://potters.ge/index.php/page/services\">Potters</a>, Levan Pangani \u2013 <a href=\"http://oikos-international.org/tbilisi/\">Oikos</a>, and me. So far, it has been Ninutsa, Remi or I who have initiated the meetings. Notes were made by someone who volunteered, and activities were also assigned to people who volunteered for them. It works well, because people do what they want to do. Unfortunately, for some it was for work, while for others it was in their lunch breaks. But I guess this is something you always see with new initiatives.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">What, other than money, do you think could help you in your work?</h3>\n\nDefinitely a space. The one thing we need for this to work out, is to have a physical space. And finding one that ticks all the boxes has been quite challenging.\n\nAnd of course ideas. Or advice. People who have done similar things. What worked, what didn't.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">What help could you offer others and under which conditions (assuming no money is involved)?</h3>\n\nOur network, our knowledge, our space (once we have one). Anything really.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/1/13be896a4fbcb5b9e7064228146a0705dcc47c8c.jpg\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">What should those who really wish to understand the work know?</h3>\n\nWe don't really produce any products (yet). Except for interesting discussions at the meetings we have. Right now no costs are involved, except for the drinks or food we order when we meet at the cafes/restaurants we frequent for the meet-ups.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Existing alternatives: Who else is doing similar or relevant work/offering similar things- locally and or elsewhere?</h3>\n\nLocaly, it's Remi from Co-spot, who set up the first co-working place in Georgia. And also <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Generator-98-%E1%83%92%E1%83%94%E1%83%9C%E1%83%94%E1%83%A0%E1%83%90%E1%83%A2%E1%83%9D%E1%83%A0%E1%83%98-98/500733526745150\">Generator 9.8</a>. They were set up a few weeks ago. I also heard from Remi that the <a href=\"https://www.istitutoculturaitaliana.org/\">Italian Cultural Institute</a>\u00a0set up a co-working place. But they all focus more on freelancers having a place to work and connect, rather than having organizations hosted permanently in the same space. I think that's where the idea significantly differs. Although, I believe <a href=\"/u/remi\">@remi</a>\u00a0would like to be able to offer this to his clients as well. More about Co-Spot you can read here.\u00a0\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Mutual support, collaboration?</h3>\n\nWe're open to anyone wanting to join, and we would love to share our manpower/ideas/knowledge with other projects out there.\u00a0\n\nOn behalf of Elva and WeHelp we sent an applications for funding have been sent out. We will see what happens to them...\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-08-02 23:32:34", "updated_at": "2018-06-05 15:19:20.231962", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1791, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 45.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 1861], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26980, "user_id": 1450, "topic_id": 3670, "post_number": 10, "raw": "sure, you can put it anytime you like.

Curious neighbors and wandering tourists have experienced the hospitality that <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/kiwi.vegan.cafe?fref=ts\">vegan community cafe Kiwi</a> offers.</h3>\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/729fe237c388d1d4f57f3c5c892d65a1cd55ead9.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"493\"><br>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Although I am neither vegan nor vegetarian, the approach Kiwi Cafe uses is inspiring. Through education, rather than scaring, they want to convince people of a vegan life style. I even have given up cow milk products myself (for now).</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">The cafe was set up by a group of individuals that met each other in Tbilisi, foreigners and Georgians. The set up of the cafe was funded out of their own pockets, plus they got all their furniture for free from their community members. Plus free labor. Right now the cafe is self sustaining, but they are not able to pay actual salaries yet, something which they hope to be able to do eventually.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Alberto visited Tbilisi, and together with Khatuna from UNDP, Eric from Jumpstart and Jonne from Elva we had lunch at Kiwi.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">A few days later I sat down with Helen, on of its founders, to talk about the story behind Kiwi.</h3>\n\nSo we are a group of people, in the beginning mainly three people, who decided to start Kiwi Cafe. This was the beginning of June. We found this place and decided to rent it so we could get started right away. We worked on renovations for a month approximately, and planning, and then we opened. And now the constellations changed a bit. The people who were there from the start, except for me, are not working here a lot. There are now four of us who are working here every day, full time. We are volunteers, so far, but we hope that, even though we are not for profit, we will be able to give ourselves a small salary to be able to sustain.\n\nThe reason we started is because I have friends, and other people, who have been asking me a lot of questions about vegan lifestyle. What do you eat, is it possible to be vegan in Georgia, what can you eat, what do you do when you don't eat meat, and so on. My idea is that people don't know what veganism is, and the advantages of being vegan. So, they have a lot of questions about this.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9856b932730ccb7e10374f180397fd8ef03f0265.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"449\"><br>\n\nI think that most vegans try to convert people, convince people to become vegan, and I think inspiration is the best way to convert people. To establish this idea and make people understand why it is nice and why it is good. Rather than actually radical protests and making the documentaries which show the horrible meat industry. Which is of course important, but people just don't want to see that. They want to see the positive side of something. <span>That is my form of activism.</span>\n\nAnd that is also why we organize various events. Yesterday, for example, we had a concert, folk musicians, a band from Russia. And we have film showings some evenings, and origami master classes. We want to have has many different types of events as possible: for people who want to teach others what they know, in something they are very skilled at; people who want to learn something together, like a study circle kind of practice; show interesting films that people have not seen, that haven't reached Georgia, both documentaries and fiction.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Helen explains me that they don't have a manager. They are volunteers and believ that you can't have someone telling you: \u201cyou must do this.\u201d Helen has experience in working with organizations without a leader, where you make decisions together. And, athough she says it's kind of difficult, she does believe it is possible.</h3>\n\nOur team, Victoria from Russia, Moscow, Mariam, she's from here, and Sergei, he's from Krasnodar. We don't have any actual roles. But Sergei, he has professional experience as a chef, so he's always in the kitchen. I am sometimes in the kitchen and sometimes out here. And Victoria and Mariam are mostly out here. But we do circle around.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/3221c0c200d7637e509541222f4ee91f4380204c.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"445\"><br>\n\nThe problems we have right now is that we are all working a lot, all of us, all the time, which makes it impossible to do outside stuff, like promotion, social media stuff. And also to improve like, decorations, and develop the menu. Stuff like this. We would need somebody just responsible for this. But hopefully. We're trying to recruit some more volunteers.\n\nWhen you start, you are small and you have all things in hand, that needs to be done. It feels difficult to recruit somebody new. We would have to teach them everything. Of course it is possible.\n\nWe have not reached one month yet, but every day we get here, usually sergei and I, at 9 o'clock, and we prepare food. If we've already prepared most we can come a bit later. Clean up a little bit. And then we open at 12. People come usually for lunch between 12 and 2, after that it's a bit quiet for a while. And sometimes in the evening we have a ton of people.\n\nMost mornings we have two people working, one in the kitchen and one out here, others can come a bit later.\n\nWe also have friends in our community that help out doing dishes, and also help out with practical things like, now we are trying to install this internet thing. It's been very frustrating. It has been a big problem getting internet to work here. But we have a lot of support from our friends, they help out.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">So far they have mostly foreigners as customers. But sometimes they have locals. Sometimes their neighbors come in.</h3>\n\nI have perceived mostly positive reactions. We've only had a few times some drunken man came in and told us our beer was to expensive. But then we tell them it is a cafe and that they can get cheap beer across the street at the corner shop. Once we had two guys coming in saying: \u201cWhat are you doing here? This is our city!\u201d But, whatever.\n\nA lot of people have been very curious. Before we opened we had all these signs on the windows and people thought it was very unusual and strange, and a lot of people came in because the door was always open.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/2/2696dd5313df70ef0899c8ba15f42ed8650effdf.jpg\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Besides money, the support that Kiwi could use is more volunteers. Yes, they have people helping out washing dishes, but they would actually need people who can commit to one day a week, Helen tells me. She also mentions that they are trying to find some organically grown vegetable provider, because right now they don't know where to get it.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">I tell her about Iva, who has greenhouses where he grows organic vegetables. I tell her I live close and if she can get a good deal with him, I can take the vegetables to the cafe on a regular bases. A few days later she tells me that they don't have any produce right now, but that they will touch base again in September.</h3>\n\nAnother problem we've encountered in the process, is that we wanted to start a non profit organization, but we ave not done that, this place is not registered as non-profit. Because we realized in the process of registering that it would be very difficult. That we would have to hire an accountant, and a tax lawyer, and so on, for us to be able to show that we are actually not making any profit ourselves. Instead we registered as a small individual entrepreneur, and this might be misleading to some people, we tell them we act like a non profit, but we registered so we don't have to spent money on the accounting as we otherwise should. We also would have to pay higher taxes as non profit. Even if you are very small, you would still have to pay more taxes as you would when you are a small individual entrepreneur. Georgia makes it very easy to start a business, but it makes it very difficult to start a non-profit organization. Especially one which seems on the surface as a business type entity. And this is a business type entity that would provide money for our costs, but it's still non profit. But it seems suspicious probably.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">And what can they offer themselves?</h3>\n\nThe concept of having a community cafe where we host events, the experience we build up in such a short time, I guess that is what I can share with a larger community. Our cafe is open to everyone, if you can not afford to buy anything you can still come in and sit down and join our events for free. And I think this could be something that could be inspirational.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f0f1fddd3a1a062789b43e0f7056d8a4d4db9614.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\"><br>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">What about similar initiatives?</h3>\n\nIn Georgia I don't think there are any similar initiatives. There are places that host events, like Zoestan on Leselidze street. But internationally, for sure. Many places I have been to in the states, in Berlin, also in Malmo in Sweden where I lived for a long time we had a cafe that was kind of similar, they had movement events, though that was mostly political.\n\n<strong>Pooling resources</strong>: sounds like a good idea, I think that's what we've done here.\n\n<strong>Collaboration</strong>: most important thing for human beings in general, I though a lot of this. <span>In some cultures people compete a lot, and in some people collaborate more. </span>At least on the surface, maybe there's competition under the surface. In the american culture, I lived for some while over there, there is quite a lot of competition, and in Swedish culture, where I also live a long time, it is more collaboration. And I enjoy the second one much more. Even though, both can be successful.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-08-03 01:54:27", "updated_at": "2018-06-05 15:19:49.599702", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1921, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 55.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2201], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18814, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1458, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>You as in \"voi\", not you as in \"tu\"</b>\n\nWhat I mean is: who do you refer to as \"we\" in \"Look what we've done\"?

Then any public (or private) screen could be used to project these works for audiences to experience.

The player would pick the mission, shut down their computer, get out on the street, play the mission, collect the necessary proof of his experience and then, after returning home, publish the mission attaching photos and videos.\n\nOne year later they pitched it in front of a panel of investors and won the TechGarage awards for Best Italian Startup. They went on to win every tech startup competition in which they participated. Since then they have designed strategic presentations for top leadership at Luxottica, Vodafone, PriceWaterHouse Coopers, UniCredit, eBay, Italian Ministry for Economic Development and the Tunisian Ministry for Tourism.\n\nHow to register for the Power Pitch Masterclass:  We ask for 600 Euros per participant to help cover costs.

We came up with a few actionables as we kick OpenCare into gear, to be executed after we sign the Grant Agreement but other than that as soon as possible. <strong>This is a wiki, edit as needed</strong>.\n\nWe identified two major success metrics (\"epic goals\") for OpenCare:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>A high impact publication on community-driven care services. Think Wikinomics, but for care. Wikinomics was the output of a large research project with generous funding; now we have a similar project in our hands, and should aim for the same kind of result or better \u2013 though of course we may fail.</li>\n\n<li>The spinoff of a viable company that produces community-driven care services.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nWith those in mind, we moved to identify small, realistic actionable steps that would bring us closer to those goals. At the end of each actionable we tentatively list the people in charge: if want to assign yourself to one or more of them, just add your name. They are:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>Compile a list of people in your personal network that can help with OpenCare</strong>. These can be care professionals; scholars; people that have experience of using care services, either by receiving treatment or by being family or friends to people that received treatment; makers; data people; simply people who care. [everyone]</li>\n\n<li><strong>Recruit journalists-storytellers to \"seed\" the OpenCare conversation</strong> with stories and experiences from community-driven care services [<a href=\"/u/markomanka\">@markomanka</a>\u00a0and SCIMPULSE].</li>\n\n<li><strong>Make alliances in the open medical data movement</strong> [<a href=\"/u/alberto\">@Alberto</a>, <a href=\"/u/markomanka\">@markomanka</a>].</li>\n\n<li>The IdeaSquare space and organisation are very open to proposals. Maybe we could think of one or more OpenCare events to happen there? Are there other collaboration opportunities? [<a href=\"/u/markomanka\">@markomanka</a>, <a href=\"/user/8192\">@Massimo</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"/u/salvo_cognetti\">@Salvo_Cognetti</a>, can you provide some ideas?]</li>\n\n<li>At LOTE5: <strong>schedule a session on Healthonomics</strong>. Is the medical-industrial complex hackable? What do we know about it? This is to be a high-level problem description, probably videoed, which we can use during OpenCare as a primer for people who want to be active in the community [<a href=\"/u/markomanka\">@markomanka</a>\u00a0+ <a href=\"/u/lakomaa\">@Lakomaa</a>\u00a0+ external experts: Alberto suggests <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pub/simona-ferlini/34/908/4ab\">Simona Ferlini</a>].\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>At LOTE5: <strong>schedule a session on how to make an acceptable prototype of a community-driven care service</strong>. Supposing a care service is some kind of co-living: how do you prototype that within the time and budget constraints of OpenCare? What is the minimum viable prototype? We clearly cannot procure a purpose-built facility and put 50 people in it for a year!

During these personal interactions it\u2019s not the scientific \u201cWhy\u201d we tap into but \u201cWhy at the human level. It's in the personal interactions that give a voice to humanistic problems which often lead to a beneficial change in health and social care. Whether it\u2019s an individual or a community that had direct or an indirect contribution, it gives the opportunity to learn more about the initiative and think about how their own activities and environment will change. Get people talking, involved and engaged.\n\nOften, a conversation can take an initiative in a whole new direction. Pointed, and mulled over with care \u2014 can change the direction of a project. This was the case for Sara Savian and Mauro Alfieri, creators of <a href=\"http://www.scimpulse.org/2017/04/meet-rehub-glove-open-source.html\">reHub</a>. The glove designed for proprioceptive rehabilitation and to recover movement fluidity after an injury.  It allows the patient to record and report exercises, data- such as hand position and fingertips pressure.\n\nIn 2014 Sara Savian and Mauro Alfieri started their journey with a \u201ctest on sensors \u201cand they had presented their first prototype at the Arduino User Group &amp; Wearables community at WeMake. The purpose for this to share projects, knowledge and create discussions on Arduino and Wearables and smart textiles.  The intent was to explore how it can be used? How can it add value and be of use socially?  What could be built on this foundation? These discussions could change the course for many participants.\n\nSara and Mauro not only had many questions answered, but they left with the idea of going back to the drawing board and creating something that would be beneficial to society.\n\nA conversation between a physiotherapist and someone suffering from hand disability created inquiry for Sara and Mauro. They exchanged and shared thoughts on their project, how could it be of use and that led to further discussion. It was the trigger point for them and a stepping stone for their project. We can\u2019t capture every discussion that took place as dialogue is woven into many discussions. But this one interaction planted the seed for what is now reHub.\n\n We asked Sara to recollect this conversation:\n\n<em>John:  \"I suffer from a hand disability that limits my activities of daily life. Self-sufficiency is greatly reduced and hinders the quality of life for me. Constant monitoring of my movements and joints must be done frequently to evaluate my progress by and going back and forth as an outpatient for evaluations. This interferes with my daily activities.\u201d*</em>\n\n<em>Physiotherapist: \u201cThere has been an advancement in technologies in the rehabilitation to help patients achieve maximum recovery outcomes. In Italy, physiotherapists have no access to digital tools to evaluate rehabilitative progress for hand movements. Having instant access to this therapy anytime would be greatly beneficial.\"*</em>\n\n<em>We asked Sara and Mauro how this conversation altered the course for reHub?</em>\n\n<em>Sara: \u201cThis made us re-evaluate our project in a variety of ways and prompted us to think in broader terms and combine the \"test on sensors\" with solving a problem. We know that there is a lot of learning that needs to be done when you put the device in the hands of people that are just things you would not expect.\"</em>\n\n<em>Mauro: \"From this discussion, Sara and I saw the opportunity offer a solution and an experience of an emerging area of wearable technology together with the sensing technology and decided to create a device that could be delivered in a rehabilitation approach to support patients\u2019 and to monitor hand rehabilitation. From listening to challenges that are faced on a daily basis, and realizing how painful it is for the patient and family. We need to work with them to help co-create with us.\"</em>\n\nWith the project in its early stage, Sara wanted to share this:\n\nSara: \u201cThere is much work to do including working with actual users and receiving their feedback. With the goal of making it open source, fully customizable and adaptable, a community of user is required. We are solving the problem of monitoring the progress of rehabilitation therapy and the people directly impacted must be included.\u201d\n\nWe asked what\u2019s next for reHub?\n\n<em>Sara: \"We know that rehabilitation is time-consuming and demotivating and we plan to change that with a reHub device to empower patients through their therapy. Rehabilitation is often costly, by making it open source, it\u2019s affordable and accessible for people who are living with limitation and this could drastically improve their mental well-being during the road of recovery. This will allow the vast majority of patients to be sent home with a rehabilitation program to practice on their smartphone or tablet. We will be creating a community of shared knowledge and development with a broader view of use for the glove and will start working within the European project OpenCare.\"</em>\n\nThe reHub team is taking a broad approach in this area and looking for users and a community that will benefit and help develop different options: sport, gaming, educational, medical.\n\nWhy is it important to work with the community to further develop reHub?\n\n<em>Sara: \"Spending time with a community, or patients that will benefit from what you\u2019re creating is looking at the problem in a human-centered way and it highlight\u2019s what\u2019s needed instead of just relying on responses to questions. Spending time with people in the area of use is a really important step in the design process. So we\u2019re back to the drawing board. We need to know what from the user's perspective so we can design with them in mind and could effectively confront the future of this project, orienting it to a continuous use in proprioceptive physiotherapy.\u201d</em>\n\nCo-creation, it matters. There is the emotional and functional connection that people have to a medical device. As far as functional, understanding how people use things, what they need to get done daily.  When we think of medical devices we initially think of accuracy, consistency, making sure it delivers the expected results. These are crucial reasons why design should be human oriented.\n\nIf people can\u2019t achieve expected results due to a design issue or flaw, then that\u2019s obviously going to have a clinical impact. From a functional aspect, understanding how people use things does matter. This is where engineering, design and the community will benefit and need to work hand in hand to understand these components. It\u2019s crucial to consider human emotions when designing medical products. Often, it\u2019s the emotional connections that people have with respect to the design. Is it flexible? The weight, how it feels, is it aesthetically appealing?\n\nThen, of course, cost and accessibility that make people gravitate toward certain devices as opposed to others. With the joined forces of diverse backgrounds of Sara and Mauro, reHub will be addressing all these concerns.\n\nreHub- goal-oriented effective rehabilitative treatment and experience that will help patients return to family, job, community and resume regular daily activities.\n\nMore updates as reHub evolves\n\n*<em>The name of John and the physiotherapist have been used to maintain privacy.</em>", "created_at": "2017-05-24 17:07:37", "updated_at": "2018-05-09 17:01:35.430408", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1230, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 10.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 411, "user_id": 4922, "topic_id": 378, "post_number": 1, "raw": "**_Available in: :gb: [English](#en) / :ka:[Georgian](#ge)_**\n\n---\n\n<img alt=\"\" src='/uploads/default/original/2X/2/2af75cd95af43f7d0bbcb23b91d4b26b95cccdec.jpg' style=\"height:580px; width:900px\">\n\n## :gb: **_English version_** <a name=\"en\"></a>\n\nFor other Edgeryders to interact with you, you need to be visible: you need to be known.

This phenomenon made itself felt in the software, publishing, music, education, and journalism industries a decade or more ago. Now it's enabling a similar kind of individual empowerment in regulatory functions: the individual citizen, worker and consumer, or self-organized networks of such individuals, can challenge the power of giant corporate and state institutions in ways that previously required the countervailing power of other large institutions..\n\nWith the desktop and digital revolution, the network revolution, and the forms of stigmergic organization that they make possible, the individual increasingly has at her disposal the means of taking on large, powerful bureaucratic institutions as an equal. So basically networked activism offers to do to the state and the large corporation what the file-sharing movement has only begun to do to the record industry, and what Wikileaks has barely even begun to do to the U.S. national security community. Is this groundbreaking or what?\u00a0\n\nTo publish Desktop Regulatory State more quickly and perhaps on a larger scale, Kevin needs funding (perhaps a grant from a non-profit institution that would allow him to publish it with an open license like CC), so if you happen to work in publishing or know people who know people who could help just drop a line and <strong>help Kevin</strong>!

Also, I hope all goes well with the new knee!\n\nI have to be careful not to wear down my teeth too much when reading how the situation is. I really don't know how to begin. My impression is that there are so many things aggravating the situation it'll be a long, hard, and steep road to work up for the people there. The earthquake(s) could have been much more devastating, but still any bit of damage in Nepal goes right into the substance of what the people have to survive on, while time is not on their side. And it'll be really hard to quickly fix anything from the outside, working through the constricted bottleneck of <a href=\"http://morailogistics.com/logistics-in-crisis-the-nepal-earthquakes/\">logistics</a> - with the unnecessary bureaucratic issues heaped on top. All the time media interest is dwindling quickly. Perhaps you'll find more of an open ear at UPS and FedEx than DHL (honestly, I am not surprised they weren't very helpful). The logistics to rural Nepal are probably on par with lifting something to low earth orbit and just dropping it there. I do understand the Chinese manufacturer playing it safe. I know some people in intermodal freight and that location must be challenging on a good day - <em>now</em> it looks like you need <a href=\"/t/preparedness-goes-a-really-long-way/4460\">a whole different set of skills and connections</a>...\n\nRegarding the tarpaulins - yeah I expect they are pretty frustrating to live under if you are not just doing some fair weather camping. Still, if there is enough cordage they should be better than nothing, and are relatively easy to get to the places that have an immediate need. There are many videos on how to tie them down effectively - which may help if that is not something the local know already. Of course the CGI is what you really want - but it'll need more time I am sure.\n\nRegarding the <a href=\"/u/hexayurt\">@hexayurt</a> I would be interested to piggyback in case Vinay has some time to look into the matter more closely. If I know what the typical hold-ups are in detail, I can help much more effectively. Unfortunately it smells a bit like mental lethargy that they wouldn't jump on the topic. Even if they were only up for a couple of months - there's a good chance they'd have dragged in a lot of support (and donations) in their wake. Ah well, such is life. Small steps.\n\nSuperadobe should also work with <em>some </em>rocks at least. It seems to have the charm that you don't need a very specialized workforce to get going on it either - which seems to be an advantage compared to the Holcim foundation approach (perhaps that would make more sense later in the reconstruction effort). If I can think of other things to help I'll holler. Thanks for your detailed reply! It is much appreciated.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-28 10:54:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:54.384770", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 555, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [31617], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19929, "user_id": 217, "topic_id": 2020, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>UnMonastery video</b>\n\nI can help plan and shoot an UnMonastery video during LOTE3.

D\u00e9mopolitique seemed to be only used as a contraction of demographic politics, demopolitique.anything was available so we chose it, and it really made sense.\n\nDemos from ancient greek : the people and\u00a0Politics in the sense of affairs of the city, as it was modeled by Aristote.\n\nAnd it's exactly about that : a place to let the people discuss about the affairs of the city.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe main idea was to create a sane environment to debate, to create conditions and formulate its principles to allow a constructive debate.\n\nI made a lot of searches in order to design it, especially about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing\">crowdsourcing </a>and <a href=\"http://demopolitique.com/node/47\">crowdsolving</a>. It lead me to the idea to instumentalise <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic\">dialectic </a>by using modern communication tools.\n\nWhen people meet physically to discuss important matters, there are a lot of parameters that can alter, make difficult or impossible a dialectic process. In virtual environments such as forums, there are others parameters that can lead to pointless discussions that lead nowhere.\n\nD\u00e9mopolitique is thought to get rid of these parameters, or to use them.\n\nSome parameters that can alter a dialectic process are pointed in\u00a0<a href=\"http://demopolitique.com/node/59\">this discussion</a>\u00a0(in french).\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe have used this tool with some friends to discuss matters such as <a href=\"http://demopolitique.com/node/58\">capitalism\u00a0</a>and as you can see, there are a lot of informations in this discussion. Each of us found informations and shared it, we thought about it, and later, each of us formulated his thoughts about capitalism. The result just went beyond my craziest expectations. We now all know how money is created, the economics absurdity that rule the world, and each one of us shared his sight of the problem and pointed specific parameters that, if altered, could change things.\n\nDuring the process of this discussion, we have learned, searched, thought, wrote and shared our sights and it made us more aware of theses problems.\n\nWe have also tried to get relevant information to start debates on knowledge and searches, not opinions or ideas.\n\nAnother exemple could be this essay about a psychological mechanism : <a href=\"http://demopolitique.com/node/61\">la dilution de la responsabilit\u00e9</a>.\n\nI've tried to do my best to find good references to enhance the quality of the reasonment, and the answers to this essay have just improved this reasonment by opening it to domains i wouldn't have thought otherwise.\n\n\u00a0\n\nActually d\u00e9mopolitique is in beta stage. I've developped it with the precious help and advices of my brothers and friends, but I can't continue to develop it on my own. I'm not a technical guy, i'm a writer, and i'm much better with words and concepts than with codes.\n\nThere are a lot of tools already designed that just wait human help or funding.\n\nTo be honest it's a tricky and complicated thing, and i have some difficulties to find people to discuss about the most important :<a href=\"http://demopolitique.com/taxonomy/term/7\"> d\u00e9mopolitique in its principles and its core</a>, but also<a href=\"http://demopolitique.com/taxonomy/term/27\"> its tools.</a>\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt's a democratic place, so everything can be discussed and modified to adapt quickly to reality.\n\nFor exemple, at the first release, there was a voting tool. <a href=\"http://demopolitique.com/node/48\">We discussed about it</a>, and a friend got a good argument that convinced us to remove it.\n\nIt was just about dialectic : we had different opinions, he got the better arguments and reasoning, we accepted it and adapted the tool to match better with reality.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nI've worked more than six months on this platform, night and day. At some point i even forgot myself and got physically and mentally exhausted.\n\nI went forward thanks to my bros and friends, and because i knew it could work. And it did.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt's a tool for people made by people.\n\nI don't wanna earn money from my past work or anything, I just need some funds to get a development team, because some aspects are real technical challenges as a lot of tools i've designed simply don't exist.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-01 14:21:22", "updated_at": "2017-09-20 14:35:32.469113", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 885, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 25.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24138, "user_id": 2754, "topic_id": 5044, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>dates</b>\n\nArriving Hamburg 21.00 on 26th &amp; leaving on 30th.\n\nSee you then\n\n&amp; met @maxlath\u00a0at The Climate Action Zone\u00a0in Paris during COP21 - he's looking for a bed at 32C3 if one comes up\n\n<span>k</span>\n\n", "created_at": "2015-12-13 22:02:46", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:13.889371", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 62, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [98], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19203, "user_id": 2569, "topic_id": 704, "post_number": 17, "raw": "\"So, large mobilization doing suboptimal work is still better than the alternative of not helping or having enough help\"\n\nthis is definitely the case at the Calais camp\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-16 20:30:14", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:47.094346", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 32, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 6.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [19161], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8641, "user_id": 116, "topic_id": 2558, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>So intersting...in my experience</b>\n\nall the survey methodology has clearly reached its limit in knowledge geenration. its still alive beasue it alloves decision makers and research buyers to keep controll of results.\n\ndefine questionnaire -&gt; data processing -&gt; decision about how to present the data + no possibility to have a deep and full understanding of meanings /interpretation of single answers \"education, development..whatever\" (respondendts opinion is confined in a click...) is a great limit ...\n\n", "created_at": "2014-03-22 15:20:33", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:49.937760", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 81, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29849, "user_id": 1974, "topic_id": 3367, "post_number": 14, "raw": "<b>hope it will be helpful</b>\n\n<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1v2WvAUQHYSpbNJcP760LWocR41DMfzsN\">bullet points.odt</a>", "created_at": "2014-07-22 21:26:24", "updated_at": "2018-02-26 09:14:18.117641", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 20, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [29551], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32801, "user_id": 3074, "topic_id": 4918, "post_number": 40, "raw": "<b>... and if you have access to the opencare google repository</b>\n\n...

Seda is 29 and has 3 kids, and this is a key reason for starting her startup project, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/tata.armenia\">Ta-Ta: Mom's Helper</a>.</span>\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/1qeWFAKQir8\n\n<span>Being a mother of three is a big challenge anywhere, but especially in Armenia - of course there are kindergartens, but in Armenia, when you become a mother, you often lose your own independence and social life.\u00a0 \"<em>when you decide to become a mom you have to quit your own life</em>\"</span>\n\n<span>Seda decided to change that - she did not have that bad experience, she didn't \"quit her own life\" and so she decided to be an example to other mothers. First of all, providing basic services which help mothers to feel like more independent people.\n\n<span>The idea was submitted to the UNDP KolbaLabs innovation lab last year, where it was one of 4 winners and was awarded funds to get started.</span> <span>Now it is a registered organisation, and they have started with the first stage - a babysitting service, which is not common in Armenia.<span> Seda has<span> recruited more than 10 young people (girls - Armenian boys don't tend to see themselves as babysitters, not yet anyway.)</span> </span>They look after the kids in their own homes, and hopefully soon will be doing so in Ta-Ta's own venue. They have customers already, the service haas been running 2 months</span>.</span>\n\n<span>Seda wants to empower mothers to be able to call a babysitter when they need or to drop the kids off at the venue if the want to go out and do something else for an evening. But she also wants to engage moms themselves - for example through cooking - many mothers don't have a great deal of education and may not be employed, but they have excellent cooking skills and they could use those skills and cook for larger groups than just their own kids. There are many other traditional 'mom jobs' - such as knitting - where those skills can be shared and put to use for the wider community. These moms can help each other directly, they can start businesses, and they can grow as a cooperative.</span>\n\n<span>The biggest challenge initially was simply financial - how do we pay the babysitters etc. but winning the competition provided some money to help get started with that, and now they need to properly develop a business model that fits with this social enterprise. Currently mothers pay for specific services delivered, but that's just the beginning. the idea is to run it as a membership model, which covers all services - and with more members, the wider the service can spread, and the lower the cost to be part of it.</span>\n\n<strong>how you can help:</strong>\n\n<span>It's always useful to hear about the experiences of others who have dealt with this issue, or similar projects and approaches.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0</span>\n\n<span>the main issue right now is the basic need to reach financial sustainability, so any ideas or leads people may have to help in this regard would be very useful.</span>\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-26 22:05:21", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:15.736719", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 705, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1933], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2363, "user_id": 196, "topic_id": 2330, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a6c78a7d7d3c72a09bf7eeb8129ce6748da224c0.jpg\" width=\"599\" height=\"358\"><br>\n\n<span>As some of you may have noticed, after a first period in which I was deeply participating in the project, my involvement and energy about the unMonastery went down, especially after LOTE3.</span><br style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial; font-size: small; line-height: normal;\">\n\n<br style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial; font-size: small; line-height: normal;\">\n\n<span>In the last weeks, I had very enriching and fruitful exchanges with [Ben] via email and private calls about my concerns regarding the unMonastery.</span><br style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial; font-size: small; line-height: normal;\">\n\n<br style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial; font-size: small; line-height: normal;\">\n\n<strong><span>I think it is important to share these concerns with the community and that\u2019s why I am writing this post.</span><br style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial; font-size: small; line-height: normal;\">\n\n<br style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial; font-size: small; line-height: normal;\">\n\n<span>In Matera I had an annoying feeling : everyone around me was telling how good it was to be there and how great what we achieved was.</span></strong><br style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial; font-size: small; line-height: normal;\">\n\n<br style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial; font-size: small; line-height: normal;\">\n\n<span>What we\u2019ve done so far for the building of unMonastery and what we\u2019ve done at Lote3 is great but I still personally feel disappointed: actually, I have bigger expectations for unMonastery and I had bigger expectation for the event when I came to Lote.</span><br style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial; font-size: small; line-height: normal;\">\n\n<br style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial; font-size: small; line-height: normal;\">\n\n<span>I believe in unMonastery as an alternative to traditional approaches as it is designed from the beginning.\n\nI consider unMonastery as one of my professional project and I expect the best results from it.</span><br style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial; font-size: small; line-height: normal;\">\n\n<br style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial; font-size: small; line-height: normal;\">\n\n<span>At LOTE3 I realised there was a lot of problems related to the project and during the days I was there, I think we spent time talking about us, our dreams about the project, our expectations but not enough about how to solve those problems to make unMonastery a good project.</span><br style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial; font-size: small; line-height: normal;\">\n\n<br style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial; font-size: small; line-height: normal;\">\n\n<span>Here a few points describing my main concerns.</span>\n\n<span>Please please please add your comments : I really need your feedbacks.</span>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Lack of a clear economic model</strong></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial; font-size: small; line-height: normal;\">During my Italy tour before unMonastery, almost everyone I met asked me how this community-based project was going to run without money and I had no answer.

At least when believing <em>rationally</em> and avoiding self-delusional religious feelings, it's a plain and simple insight that there's so much random nonsense (and random destruction and random evil) happening in this world that there can only be very little direct action by all-good, omnipotent God. So for nearly all practical matters of daily life, the believer is also without God. Letting that sink in, deeply, is a deeply depressing insight (I can tell). Yet it's not a new one for Judeo-Christian theology: old Solomon depicts this quite ingeniously in the Bible's <a href=\"http://crosswire.org/study/passagestudy.jsp?mod=KJV&amp;key=Ecc1\">Book of Ecclesiastes</a>.\n\nSo what? My personal take on this never-ending struggle to retain faith (vision, motivation) in daily life is quite pragmatic. A bit like Alberto's: I look for and trust good people (includes the dangers of getting hurt and disillusioned, for which I have no remedy ...). Then also, having finally come to accept that the world is full of random nonsense and random catastrophes also did set me free in a weird way: now, trying to make the world a better place does not have to stress me out any more. I may fail, for random reasons out of my control, but can still keep myself in well regard <em>because I seriously tried</em>. And knowing that success in fixing the world is kinda random and can \"just happen\" also opens the space to start something deliberately utopian. unMonastery in your case; <a href=\"http://ma.juii.net/blog/category/earthos\">EarthOS</a><sup>1</sup> in mine. All of this works without having faith in God.

I hope the design skills were developed in the UK. He may have been greatly in need of a broader perspective, something this internship would have granted him.

Given the identified challenge of a lack of intergenerational spaces, as well as the language difficulties, establishing a more collaborative and sustainable - in that the skill sharing continues beyond the unMonastery residency period - program presented itself as favorable; thus prompting my project to change to facilitating a series of open workshops on varying skills in the establishment of an OpenTechSchool in Matera.\n\n<strong>Successes:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Several workshops held weekly</li>\n\n<li>Event organization (Arduino Day)</li>\n\n<li>Collaborating with 4 local projects on their websites</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Challenges:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Language difficulties (a need to improve my Italian)</li>\n\n<li>Initially unclear of how to best communicate workshop schedule and content</li>\n\n<li>Difficulty to onboard projects from high schools in Matera</li>\n\n<li>Unexpected amount of time needed to invest in the internal unMonastery infrastructure</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Activities and Outputs:</strong>\n\n<em><strong>OpenTechSchool:</strong></em>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Held 10 workshops since the unMonastery\u2019s official opening 5 weeks ago, instructed a total of 49 students</li>\n\n<li>Presented OpenTechSchool at two student assemblies, University of Basilicata, Liceo Classico, and Liceo Artistico</li>\n\n<li>Organized and facilitated a workshop for children during the Arduino Day event at unMonastery</li>\n\n<li>Made connections with the OpenTechSchool community at large</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<em><strong>Community Website Project:</strong></em>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Collaboratively launched a website for the <a href=\"http://www.benetural.com/neturaltalk\">Netural Talk</a> project</li>\n\n<li>In communication with 3 other local businesses and projects on how to develop their website and online presence</li>\n\n<li>Building a linked (and visible online/ offline) community for projects, including a website for the local artisans network and for the Mapping the Commons unMonastery project (currently in development)</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<em><strong>Arduino Day:</strong></em>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Working in collaboration with Casa Netural, we organized an event on the 29th March at the unMonastery to celebrate the 10th birthday of Arduino, in line with world-wide celebrations</li>\n\n<li>The aim was to establish relationships with local people (and potentially involve them in further projects) and to show the world that Matera is dynamic place</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<em><strong>Miscellaneous:</strong></em>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Developed unMonastery website</li>\n\n<li>Organized workshops with local artisans for Family Day</li>\n\n<li>Produced print materials, including personal cards and flyers, for unMonastery</li>\n\n<li>Facilitating Network Analysis and Evaluation project</li>\n\n<li>Currently planning to create online visualizations for Analytics project</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nRelationships: http://www.immateriallabour.com/unmon/report/kei\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-24 13:58:23", "updated_at": "2018-06-01 06:06:01.044717", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 612, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 25.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11638, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 5003, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>For pitches look in the doc I just shared with you</b>\n\n:)\n\n", "created_at": "2015-11-26 13:35:24", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:06.899612", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 15, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [9178], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11951, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 3965, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Text amended</b>\n\nThanks for caring, Noemi!

The initiative started in February 2014 as a movement of solidarity in response to the crisis in Ukraine during Euromaidan. Since then the initiative has organized and facilitated more than 20 theatre events in Kiev and across the country. Using theatre as the main tool, the initiative aims to build dialogue and look for bottom-up solutions with communities around urgent social issues, such as: the consequences of Maidan, corruption in the education system, gender stereotypes in Ukrainian society, career choice and civic activism of youth, life of internally displaced people in large cities of Ukraine and others. The initiative uses various techniques of interactive theatre, which are all part of \u201cTheatre of the Oppressed\u201d methodology.\n\n<strong style=\"font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.7;\">Why theatre?</strong>\n\nFounder of \"Theatre of the Oppressed\" Augusto Boal \u00a0defined theatre as \u201ca space where someone acts and someone else is watching\u201d. In that sense, he said \u00a0\u201cEvery person is theatre. Because we are all capable of acting and observing ourselves in action.\u201d Unfortunately, through oppression and social injustice, many people have been deprived of their capacity to act, and have become only observers of their own lives. Through theatre, Boal wanted to return to people their inherent capacity to create, to act, to reflect upon their own actions, and thus become actors, and not only spectators of their own lives.\u00a0\n\n<strong>About the methodology</strong>\n\nTheatre of the Oppressed (TO) is a theatre method created by a Brazilian theatre director and politician Augusto Boal in 1960 during military dictatorship in Brazil. With the help of TO Boal sought to create safe spaces people who struggled from oppression and injustice, so that they could equally participate in the creative process, discuss and find solutions for social and economic problems they face. \u00a0\n\nThe methodology includes a system of games, exercises and techniques, which create opportunities for dialogue, critical reflection and active search for bottom-up solutions of social issues. As an interactive and participatory form of theatre, it helps people rehearse their actions and find in the safe space of theatre the opportunities which can later be used in real life. One of the most well-known tools of TO is Forum-theatre.\n\n<strong>What is Forum-theatre (FT)?</strong>\n\nFT is an innovative methodology, aimed at resolving social issues through theatrical games, exercises and scenes. The essence of the method lies in creating a forum-play based on the life experience of participants. The actors in these play are people without any theatrical experience, they are average people who face challenging life situations. During a preparatory workshop participants together with the Joker (facilitator of Forum Theatre) research the issues which they are facing, through games, exercises and scenes. While working on the play, the participants are better able to understand their own issues, share their stories and find support among other group members. At the end of the workshop, the group creates a forum-play, which shows a protagonist facing different challenges but not finding a solution. After seeing the play, spectators can discuss the issue, which the play raises, and then come on stage to replace one of the characters and show a possible solution of the problem. In such a way, actors and spectators discuss the issue together and jointly look for solutions.\n\nTo know more about \u201cTheatre for Dialogue\u201d, visit our facebook page <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/theatrefordialogue\">https://www.facebook.com/theatrefordialogue</a> or email us <a href=\"mailto:theatrefordialogueua@gmail.com\" target=\"_blank\">theatrefordialogueua@gmail.com</a>\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-01 09:26:43", "updated_at": "2018-06-05 15:58:34.373607", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 647, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 160.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12720, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1260, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>I'll take care of it</b>\n\nIt was actually rightly filed, only added to an extra group on top of the right one.

Despite the clarity and logic of the project to like minded individuals such as those found here and other communities similar to EdgeRyders, mainstream institutions have seen many projects fail - who's to say ours won't?\u00a0\n\nThe point at which you own the land, is the point at which the weight of responsibility multiplies, significantly - we've seen from any number of projects, city plans and well intentioned community planning that things get tricky and complicated on the ground. I'm thinking of things on the scale of modernist housing projects, which we're now witnessing the fallout of utopian's best intentions.\n\nIn this moment we're working through certain compromises, there's a signifcant shift in power taking place globally, but who 'wins' is entirely undetermined, broadly speaking the actors are institutions (i.e the state), the free market and a growing networked society. Each of these players has a very real stake in the assets that require societal shift on the scale we think is coming. Unless you want to fight over property relations, in a very ugly way, then you need to establish a way of working that is better and creates greater meaning for all parties; but that is also accountable. The scale of meeting such a balance is pretty high. unMonastery is transitionary, it's an experiment to begin to map out how some of this might work and share those learnings. In the UK land ownership hasn't really changed for thousands of years, who can say if we're be successful in a way that is replicatable across borders. Despite these odds,\u00a0I do think we're better placed in history than we have been for a very long time to make a move like this.\u00a0\n\n2) Money, in my experience everything breaks when money gets involved, the work and companies bred from the California Idealogy are a good case in point - things like The Whole Earth catalog gave rise and had a heavy influence on companies like Google and Apple, however their ability to realise and implement those early intentions has seen to be shortcoming in the face of enormous wealth and shareholder influence.\u00a0\n\nunMonastery for me is not a utopian project designed to solve the woes of the world, it operates at the scale of the invention of the fire hydrant, it's designed to put out fires in the present moment, so that others can begin to build foundations and infrastructure for doing the next bit, a safe space for problem solving - who knows though, unMonastery or other projects like it might birth a project capable of making major impact on\u00a0global problems but that shouldn't be the aim at the outset, at least not in the first 10 years of the project plan,\u00a0otherwise we're likely to be jaded and alienated by our failures, not recognises our success (however incremental), unable to reiterate in the face of change/crisis\u00a0and at worst rehash the communes of the 60; giving rise to the next silicon valley, for the benefit of the few who were involved in cryptocurrency, the sharing economy and hacker culture, whilst all other facets of society fall off the edge of a cliff - we'd like to do one part really well and then decide collectively what the next step is.\n\nThese are just my thoughts and feelings, they don't necessary reflect the overall intentions of all those involved but I figured it'd be useful to expand on some of the points set out. Very open to learning from your intepretations and own projects :)\n\n", "created_at": "2013-12-04 14:36:37", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:06.290022", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 707, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [22282], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2446, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 2413, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\u00a0\n\nhi everyone.

The group think of filming the stories one day or publishing different parts of the project, like \u2018\u2019Human pain\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2019Human smile\u2019\u2019 etc. It\u2019s all up to Humans whether the \u2018\u2019Project Human\u2019\u2019 will further succeed. It can be an encyclopedia, an encyclopedia which is always up-to-date where humans can read real stories of real humans, perhaps find stories that resemble their own ones, find solutions or suggest their own solutions and, of course, they can always have their Human story, their contribution to the \u201cHuman Project\u2019</span>\u2019.</span></span>\n\n<span>An exciting initiative, isn\u2019t it? The most exciting in this project is that the group of young and enthusiastic people who have concerns about Humans didn\u2019t hesitate to take up necessary steps to try and find solutions to the issues of concern. They took some time from their busy, speedy life to think over people around them, those \u2018\u2019unknown heroes\u2019\u2019 as they say. They believe in their cause and are willing to continue their road. This is really a global project, a global product of global thinking. Inspiring, isn\u2019t it? A vivid example of how one's concerns and dreams can be called to life and by doing this also help others. Devotion, enthusiasm, love and belief in one's cause- this is the working way of making a change, firstly, to your own life and then to the life of a society as a whole.</span>\n\n<span>P.S. At the end, I'd like to quote a Human stroy from ''Human Project'': '\"My advice to people: draw smiles on the faces of others and they will give you a mirror to draw your own smile.\"</span>\n\n<span>P.P.S.

On ne peut plus s\u2019en tenir \u00e0 la m\u00eame d\u00e9finition de l\u2019homme qu\u2019autrefois d\u00e8s lors qu\u2019on peut, par exemple, \u00e9voquer sa fusion possible avec la machine.

Donc, tout ce qu'on peut essayer de faire, c'est de mettre en place les conditions de l'av\u00e8nement d'une nouvelle esp\u00e8ce. Qu'on appelle ce posthumain le \u00absuccesseur\u00bb ou que l'on nomme cela la \u00abSingularit\u00e9\u00bb, c'est bien la m\u00eame id\u00e9e : la conscience a \u00e9lu domicile dans le corps, mais le moment approche o\u00f9 elle va pouvoir changer d'esquif, de support, se d\u00e9barrasser du corps. Tout tourne autour de l'id\u00e9e de d\u00e9mat\u00e9rialisation : la communication est l'occasion d'une d\u00e9mat\u00e9rialisation et donc, croit-on, d'une spiritualisation. Je crois que l'id\u00e9ologie posthumaniste provient plus du sentiment d'impuissance, de la d\u00e9pression. [...] Cette fatigue d'\u00eatre soi, cette honte d'\u00eatre humain me paraissent l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment le plus int\u00e9ressant. Elle explique pourquoi, aujourd'hui, plus on d\u00e9teste l'homme, plus on aime les machines, pourquoi on tente de prendre la fuite dans le go\u00fbt pour les automatismes.\u00bb Dans cette fuite en avant, il ne s'agirait plus dor\u00e9navant pour les humains de s'affirmer, suivant le voeu de Descartes, comme \u00abma\u00eetres et possesseurs de la nature\u00bb ? Au XVIIIe si\u00e8cle, on voulait transformer l'homme en un dieu. Aujourd'hui, on est d\u00e9sabus\u00e9 par rapport \u00e0 cette possibilit\u00e9. En effet, plus nous d\u00e9veloppons des technologies qui produisent de l'autonomie, plus nous nous assujettissons \u00e0 ces technologies dont nous sommes les producteurs. Le couplage avec ces technologies produit un homme artificiel dot\u00e9 d'une autonomie qui nous d\u00e9poss\u00e8de, nous, hommes biologiques, des pr\u00e9rogatives qui \u00e9taient les n\u00f4tres.\u00bb (ref, <a href=\"http://www.marianne2.fr/Bienvenue-dans-le-monde-posthumain-_a214436.html\">Bienvenue dans le monde posthumain</a>)\n\nCe qui m\u2019int\u00e9resse, avec cet ouvrage, est que les auteurs ont consult\u00e9 une vaste brochette de personnalit\u00e9s, pas seulement des philosophes, mais \u00e9galement des m\u00e9decins, ethnologues, anthropologues, sociologues, informaticiens, chimistes, urbanistes, neuroscientifique, g\u00e9n\u00e9ticiens, \u00e9conomistes, psychologues, physiciens, ing\u00e9nieurs, \u00e9pist\u00e9mologues, juristes, historiens, psychanalystes, th\u00e9oriciens, futuristes, linguistes, essayistes, biologistes, physiologistes,\n\nMonique Atlan et Roger-Pol Droit ont interrog\u00e9, aux quatre coins du monde, les personnalit\u00e9s suivantes:\n\n<a href=\"http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Claude_Ameisen\">Jean Claude Ameisen</a>, <a href=\"http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Atlan\">Henri Atlan</a>, <a href=\"http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Aug%C3%A9\">Marc Aug\u00e9</a>, <a href=\"http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygmunt_Bauman\">Zygmunt Bauman</a>, <a href=\"http://www.lalibertedelesprit.org/spip.php?article115\">Jean-Michel Besnier</a>, <a href=\"http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%A9rard_Berry\">G\u00e9rard Berry</a>, <a href=\"http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9mi_Brague\">R\u00e9mi Brague</a>, <a href=\"http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Braungart\">Michael Braungart</a>, Monique Canto-Sperber http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monique_Canto-Sperber , Manuel Castells http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Castells , Moran Cerf http://www.kcrw.com/etc/programs/uf/uf110909the_man_who_could_re , David Chalmers http://consc.net/chalmers/ , Georges Church http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Church , Daniel Cohen http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Cohen_%28%C3%A9conomiste%29 , Antonio Damasio http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Damasio , Stanislas Dehaene http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislas_Dehaene , Philippe Descola http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Descola , Freeman Dyson http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeman_Dyson , Jean-Pierre Dupuy http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Pierre_Dupuy , Bernard Edelman http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Edelman , Alain Ehrenberg http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Ehrenberg , Ren\u00e9 Frydman http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Frydman , Francis Fukuyama http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Fukuyama , Marcel Gauchet http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Gauchet , Andr\u00e9 Green http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Green , J\u00fcrgen Habermas http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BCrgen_Habermas , Georges Hansel http://ghansel.free.fr/ , Fran\u00e7ois Hartog http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Hartog , Fran\u00e7oise H\u00e9ritier http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7oise_H%C3%A9ritier , Jean-Claude Heudin http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Claude_Heudin , Christian Jambet http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Jambet , Sudhir Kakar http://www.sudhirkakar.com/ , \u00c9tienne Klein http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tienne_Klein , Julia Kristeva http://www.kristeva.fr/parcours.html , Ray Kurzweil http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil , Pierre-Marie Lledo http://www.colloque-afirne-uhj.org/colloques/intervenants/pierre-marie-lledo/ , Douglas Melton http://www.hsci.harvard.edu/node/723 , Jean-Claude Milner http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Claude_Milner , Marvin Minsky http://web.media.mit.edu/~minsky/ , Nicholas Negroponte http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Negroponte , Erik Orsenna http://www.erik-orsenna.com/erik_orsenna_qui.php , Corine Pelluchon http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corine_Pelluchon , Isabelle Qu\u00e9val http://www.telerama.fr/monde/la-prodigieuse-revolution-du-corps-par-la-philosophe-isabelle-queval,32228.php , Jo\u00ebl de Rosnay http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo%C3%ABl_de_Rosnay , Amartya Sen http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amartya_Sen , Richard Sennett http://www.richardsennett.com/site/SENN/Templates/General.aspx?pageid=8 , Peter Sloterdijk http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Sloterdijk , Jean-Didier Vincent http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Didier_Vincent , Elie Wiesel http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elie_Wiesel\u00a0 et Francis Wolff http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Wolff_%28philosophe%29 .\n\nIl faudrait des semaines pour passer en revue les travaux de tous ces sp\u00e9cialistes.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_nIWiKIscZJY/THByzZ6zrnI/AAAAAAAACnc/32M3crYknvQ/s400/me.jpeg\" style=\"width: 142px; height: 186px;\"> Photo: David Chalmers\n\nDavid Chalmers est directeur du Center for consciousness\u00a0 http://consciousness.anu.edu.au de l\u2019Australian National University.

If we think of ourselves as actors in the theatre of life, we manage to navigate the complexity basically by choosing the character closest to ourselves and then playing out the script.

Donc cela fait du baume pour le philosophe que je suis car, quoique nous fassions, m\u00eame lorsque je revendique mon origine parmi les petites gens, m\u00eame si je pense faire la philosophie de ces petites gens, il existe toujours un style philosophique qui fait que rien de la philosophie n'est \u00e9vident. Plus exactement le propos du philosophe est comme une mati\u00e8re premi\u00e8re qu'il convient par la suite de transformer en pr\u00e9servant au mieux ses qualit\u00e9s, pour en faire quelque chose d'utile pour soi ou la communaut\u00e9. C'est ce que je vise.\n\nOui pas mal de mes amis qui sont soit des philosophes, soit des universitaires sont techno d\u00e9faillants. Mais enfin de compte on peut les faire venir en les guidant comme tu fais pour moi, pas \u00e0 pas. Je suis de ce genre de personne qui doit voir le r\u00e9sultat pour avancer dans la technique, les modes d'emploi me sont un peu obscurs. C'est vrai que j'ai de la th\u00e9orie l\u00e0-dessus et quelques pratiques concernant la lisibilit\u00e9. As-tu remarqu\u00e9 par exemple comme une revue comme Wired contient des flyers de diff\u00e9rents styles pour ses abonnements? Une application des learning styles.\n\nJ'ai appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 \u00e0 travers twitter de commencer une discussion sur des mod\u00e8les d'Homme. Tu as apport\u00e9 l'Homme lumineux, celui dont tu as l'exp\u00e9rience \u00e0 partir du Kundalini. J'ai vu que des correspondantes italiennes avaient une exp\u00e9rience voisine de la tienne. En lisant la page Wikipedia du cr\u00e9ateur du Kundalini j'ai eu le sentiment qu'il savait qu'il construisait un Homme, un mod\u00e8le d'humain, parmi d'autres possibles, et qu'il fallait qu'il ancre son mod\u00e8le dans les d\u00e9couvertes des sciences \u00e0 propos du R\u00e9el, \u00e0 propos de l'humain.

Loin de moi une telle id\u00e9e. Plut\u00f4t rappeler \u00e0 tous que la philosophie et celle des anciens Grecs en particuliers doit \u00e9norm\u00e9ment \u00e0 la pratique des petites gens. Que seraient Platon et Aristote si eux et leurs semblables ne s'\u00e9taient frott\u00e9s aux marchands et artisans d'Ath\u00e8nes? Des r\u00eaveurs. La force de leurs philosophies tient au pragmatisme dont elles sont issues. Et l'art de gouverner et d'abord celui de qui tient le gouvernail du navire, gouvernail dont le nom grec nous a donn\u00e9 la cybern\u00e9tique qui est l'art de faire tenir du disparate ensemble pour le conduire vers sa finalit\u00e9.\n\nAllez, j'y vais, Lyne et puis si je me suis tromp\u00e9 dans mes manipulations techniques, j'esp\u00e8re que tu me diras comment m'am\u00e9liorer.\n\nxo Michel\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-13 16:10:47", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:29.503859", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 544, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [23918], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30220, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 2975, "post_number": 11, "raw": "<b>yes!</b>\n\nI was thinking exactly the same, the 24th would be good!

Rita you're\u00a0volunteering\u00a0for venue, no? This is an opportunity to take a leading role in organising Lote, plus it's easier for you since my Italian is not so great. Of course I'll be in close touch with people's contacts so you can reach everyone.\u00a0What do you think?\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-08-13 15:01:10", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:38.369202", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 208, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [28529], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33161, "user_id": 1692, "topic_id": 2553, "post_number": 37, "raw": "<b>Pictures of the solar tracker</b>\n\nHi,\n\nHere a <a href=\"/t/open-source-solar-tracker/355/prototype\">are the pictures</a> of the solar tracker prototype.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-08 21:09:06", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:02.127536", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 33, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [33154], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31272, "user_id": 2448, "topic_id": 5044, "post_number": 32, "raw": "<b>Yes, tickets please :)</b>\n\nwe both still only have tickets for today, so yes, that's welcome :)\n\n", "created_at": "2015-12-27 14:48:40", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:52.023424", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 20, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5160, "user_id": 3028, "topic_id": 5127, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hello dear ERs,\n\nI'm looking for more information about the hackaton \"Masters of Networks\".\n\nMy friend <a href=\"/u/moe\">@MoE</a> and I will arrive in Brussels on Saturday morning and would like to register for it.\n\nOur train is arriving at Midi at 10.00.

He would have a thing or two interesting things to say about resilience.\n\nI spent 4 years of my life thinking about pandemic preparedness. I connected with many 'Flubies' from around the world. One of my best friends, that I really enjoyed talking with, is Rear Admiral <b>W. </b>Craig Vanderwagen, USPHS - retired, now a senior partner with Martin-Blanck and Associates. He was the first Assistant Secretary for Preparedness &amp; Response under the redesignation of the Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness. Vanderwagen served as the Secretary's principal advisor on matters related to bioterrorism and other public health emergencies. He also coordinated interagency activities between HHS, other federal departments, agencies, offices and state and local officials responsible for emergency preparedness and the protection of the civilian population.\n\nVanderwagen used to blog on Facebook. He would post notes and I used to discuss with him, and other Facebook friends, about pandemic related issues.\n\nIn september 2010, I wrote my first blog post about open government (<a href=\"http://lynerobichaud.blogspot.ca/2010/09/le-plus-interessant-dans-le-phenomene.html\">Le plus int\u00e9ressant dans le ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne Web 2.0</a>). Vanderwagen saw it and he encouraged me to explore more in this direction, and he confirmed me that he was himself also having very similar thoughts.\n\nI, myself, have been having an experience of <strong>PREVENTION </strong>with the health systems.\u00a0\n\nI discovered that the human body is capable of self-healing. It is a very simple process, it does not cost anything, everyone has access to it, everyone can learn about how to do it.\n\nIf governments were aware that there is no need to focus on a localized part of the body, but an overall approach is what allows to self-heal, this would lead to a considerable reduction of health systems costs.\n\nThis solution, howerver, is not good for the wallets of the pharmaceutical industry. This industry is even trying to make a happiness pill by studying happy hormones. Have you ever heard of more nonsense? It would be so much simpler to find how to secrete happy hormones in the body, that sell happy hormones, don't you think?\n\nWe are observing a rise of case of burnouts, depression, depression in children, railway suicide, mental disorders of all sorts, dementia, immolation. It would not cost that much money to consider this option, the hypothesis that there is an self-healing power available for each citizen.\n\nIf we did followed this option, it would lead us to a paradigm shift.\n\nThis approach in medecine, it is not so different from the social media turn we are all experiencing. With the rise of social media, the way we communicate changed, and we realized that we are all connected with material links. We switched from speaking to one or two people, to speaking to dozens of people simultaneously. We are gradually moving towards unity (or oneness).\n\nStep 1: Apply this --- the connections we have with the rest of the world --- apply this phenomena to the human body. When the bladder has a problem, the focus should not go on just the bladder anymore, but on the whole psycho-physio organism (and beyond). When this is understood, then it becomes possible to move to the next step.\n\nStep 2: Where does the power for self-healing come from??? The answer is happiness.\n\nStep 3; What is happiness??? Ha! United Kingdom scored -44 on the scale of happiness. Do you seriously think that the majority of people in westernized countries know how to answer this question? However, there are people who would have a thing or two to say about happiness. There is a physical explanation for happiness. Happiness can become a physical perrennial state. Those in this perennial physical state have the power to self-healing and they very rarely need to use the health systems. They almost never catch a cold. When they fall on the ice or hurt themselves, it self-repairs overnight. Their system gets purified and every damaged cell, in the whole body, is replaced and healed.\n\nAre we ready to listen to such stories and consider that we each can learn to self-heal???\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-07 16:44:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:53.279965", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 753, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 20.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 4, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2968, "user_id": 1935, "topic_id": 2935, "post_number": 1, "raw": "**_Available in: :gb: [English](#en) / :ar: [Arabic](#ar)_**\n\n----------\n\n## :gb: **_English version_** <a name=\"en\"></a>\n\nIn this post I would talk a bit about the small scale CBOs and lots effort done by the youth throughout Egypt which is not mapped -as far as I know - from the Big organizations or not given the proper support , I was hoping that someone could raise this issue in the physical workshop but I will try to explain the situation as I see  it -from my small experience with these CBOs -\n\n<span>----------------------------------------------------</span>\n\nwith the current percentage of poverty in Egypt ,there are always people in need for monthly income ( mostly widows and divorced women but I don\u2019t have statistics) basically how they survive is that they take some money from more than one CBO working in their neighbourhood plus some aid from another NGO and some money from relatives neighbours and so on . so each month they struggle to get this money from different channels in order to cover their basic needs.\n\nIn order for this to happen a lot of effort is being done by \u201ceveryday heroes \u201c that volunteer in these CBOs and NGOs as well. I know some people who actually put a lot of time, money effort in this even if that affects their study and even work. But they just do this everyday and their phone is always ringing with someone who needs a medicine for his/her child. These guys are amazing social workers and would make a very good CEO for a social enterprise other than being stuck in a corporate job or a call center. ( will explain below the legal problems)\n\nThe main problem I see is that a lot of work is duplicated because people don\u2019t COLLABORATE not because they don\u2019t want to but because there are lots of rules and regulations that have to be followed - some informal collaboration is done - but not that efficient .for example in order to give money to a certain family - they way it is normally done- is that someone goes to the house and fill a questionnaire with them then give the papers to the board of the CBO to take the decision according to how much money they have . so if the family takes money from 5 different places all this work is duplicated.\n\nAnother issue is that to make  a small project for the family it needs monitoring and support and since most effort is being done as a voluntary work it has lots of problems .so in the end the result is not compared with the effort that is done .\n\nI was always wondering what would happen if the 5-7 organizations that work in the same area do things together - share their data base and produce a GIS map with all the required info - u can see on the map that for example \u201cFatma lives in 22 whatever street receives 600 monthly aid and have 2 children in elementary school \u201c so she can take the money from one channel and the others can focus on providing small projects and work on the education . as Now every one of the 5-7 organization try to do all of this together in the same time depending only in volunteers which is not an efficient way to do all these things.\n\nThere are lots of legal issues to deal with as these small organizations has lots of limitations , I am not sure about the laws now or do we have a constitution or not yet :) anyway I remember in 2011 there was no such thing as a social enterprise in the laws ( I start to see that the term is overused in Europe but I think it is a way to go to solve some problems so they can make some legal framework to work within  may be @Gazbee can know more about this issue)\n\nAlso another issue of how these small CBOs get the fund ,they are donations but there is 2 ways of donations \u201csadaka\u201d and \u201czakaa\u201d (in the muslim societies) . \u201czakaa\u201d  is the must paid charity by muslims and it has like 8 ways or tracks to be spent upon - most probably u can\u2019t pay them in something else like publicity for a charitable event ) \u201csadaka\u201d  is basically general charity and this can be invested in anyways related to charity of course .\n\nJust a final remark ,the   \u201cMinistry of Social Solidarity\u201d which is supposed to be concerned with these problems their only role - as far as I know - they do is to monitor only - coming every time interval to check that the paper and money of these small organizations is ok if we can call that monitoring- but they don\u2019t offer any kind of support .\n\nI hope that was a bit clear ,we can dive into more details in the discussion.\n\n----------\n\n##:ar: _Arabic version_ <a name=\"ar\"></a>\n\n<span>\u0641\u0649 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0634\u0627\u0631\u0643\u0647 \u0633\u0627\u062d\u0627\u0648\u0644

Discourse would be our new base software and Ruby on Rails our new programming language, just how the current platform uses Drupal as a base software and PHP as a programming language.\n\n[quote=\"johncoate, post:39, topic:6273\"]If that is the case then I am curious if Discourse can weave in with the other content on the Platform - something today's ER site does well.  Or if you have to stay within Discourse if you want to converse with people.[/quote]\n\nAll conversation would happen in Discourse (forum style) and Matrix (chat style). About the if and how of the Matrix integration I am not yet clear \u2026 it may be possible to also use Discourse itself for chat-style communication if it supports realtime updates of threads (\"topics\" in Discourse speak). Anyway, there is no real need to weave in with the other content of the platform, since all existing content (incl. wikis, posts, challenge responses etc.) will be imported into Discourse itself, into a few static pages (\"Abouts us\", \"Legals\" etc.). I am not yet clear about where to put the Edgeryders Admin group content in the future: either into Open Project, or into a private board in Discourse.\n\n[quote=\"johncoate, post:39, topic:6273\"][\u2026] it is my understanding that we have in our proposal for MENA YP that we will start out right here on \"ER classic\" and migrate over to a new Ruby-based platform once we get it set up.[/quote]\n\nThat is correct, that's the original plan. (Daniel hinted at the possibility to do the migration earlier, namely in time for the MENA Youth Platform's prototype. The time plan for that prototype would be 2017-07-15 (one month after contract start). To be discussed.)\n\n[quote=\"johncoate, post:39, topic:6273\"]If so, then what do we want the new site to do that we can't do now? Is it not a matter of how much functionality but rather functionality that is both easier to maintain and manage as well as easier for the user to understand?  I am pretty sure that is a main driver of going away from Drupal, based on what I remember Matt saying.[/quote]\n\nRight :) Drupal is a CMS for publishing content, it is not good at anything related to interaction, and it is not a specialized conversation software. When you click through the <a href=\"https://edgeryders.eu/admin\">Discourse admin backend</a> (login credentials see above) you'll see how this is much more advanced software for managing conversations. It's a pity Discourse was not around in late 2012 \u2026\n\n[quote=\"johncoate, post:39, topic:6273\"]Posts, wikis, blogs, events, challenges, stories, projects, channels and others I am surely leaving out.  My first question is do we want to retain and present that kind of complexity to the MENA YP people and do we want the Platform we develop to have all those choices presented in the farily simultanous way that we do now?  One has to sort of wrestle with the ER platform for awhile to get it, to really grasp it.[/quote]\n\nExactly my concerns as well. The Discourse based platform should be much simpler to navigate and understand. We will not have all these different types of content there, they are largely a legacy of past experiments before settling on the challenge-and-response format. The beauty of Discourse, which will be the main interface, is that all functionality and all threads are accessible from the <em>homepage</em>. No need to navigate to some hidden sub-forums (like \"Projects\" on the current Drupal site) to see everything. Just use the filters on the homepage. In addition there are some static pages for \"About us\", \"Legals\" etc., all of which would be accessible from the main menu (which we'll add to Discourse). And that's it.\n\n[quote=\"johncoate, post:39, topic:6273\"]But really, it's how do we want to present the site and its tools to people?[/quote]\n\nAll existing content will be imported into Discourse boards (\"categories\" in Discourse) and threads (\"topics\" in Discourse), and they will be consistently called \"challenges\" and \"responses\", respectively. Actually, I am still looking for a better wording than this. \"Challenges\" and \"stories\" maybe? Do you have an idea? I think it's quite important to get these two words right, as they will be used throughout the software, and should evoke the right connotations. For example, in the light of the Open Village vision, people should be aware that it is ok to write content about open source developments / inventions created by others, if it answers to the \"challenge\".\n\n[quote=\"johncoate, post:39, topic:6273\"][\u2026] but it is also an opportunity to change things.  But that will be within the boundaries of the Ruby/Rails CMS environment and its templates and added applications.  I set up and ran a Joomla site for the radio station and I don't think it is terribly different from Ruby as a manageable CMS system.[/quote]\n\nRuby on Rails is not a CMS, but a programming language. So that's quite different from a CMS. I intentionally don't want a general-purpose CMS as base software anymore, since CMSs suck at interaction, and are not optimized to handle online dialogue. So beyond Discourse (and a Matrix chat client should we add that), there are no pre-defined features as \"boundaries\". We can add whatever features we want by programming them in Ruby, and that is much faster than extending Drupal with self-developed modules written in PHP. However, as always, if we can get around programming something, we take that opportunity. So the question is rather \"How can we map the features we want to what Discourse provides?\". Plus, of course, \"What features do we have to write in Ruby because Discourse does not provide them?\". I provided an outline of a potential answer to the first question <a href=\"/t/planning-for-our-new-platform/6273/33\">above</a>, and any feedback and counterproposals would involve digging through the Discourse backend. In addition, everyone is welcome to propose essential features to add that Discourse does not have. You can use a visual map for that, sure.", "created_at": "2017-06-11 13:21:00", "updated_at": "2018-01-20 12:50:50.565148", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1108, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [30473], "is_reply_to": [30473], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21514, "user_id": 116, "topic_id": 2519, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>good. let me know</b>\n\neventually give me a call if you need to go to details fast or discuss anything\n\nciao\n\n", "created_at": "2014-03-18 14:00:07", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:59.739956", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 27, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11565, "user_id": 3613, "topic_id": 6268, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Tomorrow </b>\n\nThanks,\u00a0I'll give this more thought tomorrow &amp; do a few edits.\u00a0I'll follow up\u00a0contacts\u00a0with people or orgs who can make contributions on this theme.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-06-12 22:33:53", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:06.568181", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 39, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 6.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [8895], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32676, "user_id": 2913, "topic_id": 5571, "post_number": 35, "raw": "<b>Good!</b>\n\nWhat about the 23rd?\n\nThank you,\n\nRossana\n\n", "created_at": "2016-06-16 08:41:40", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:59.444187", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 16, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3128, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 3095, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hi Natalia,\n\nI put together the following list merging what you were interesting in getting involved in with tasks that we consider high priority.

Why do they chose this approach over another one?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\u00a0\n\nHello everyone,\n\nAs I've been doing a lot of reading lately and exploring the vast space of Edgeryders, I think I'd like to take on my first task: produce one page article about the community.\n\nIt will be ready by 25th of June - I hope this won't be too long, but I still need to get comfortable with all the information, decide on the importance, filter, write, refurbish, refurbish, refurbish.\n\nAfter that I would do the other article, in another week - and by the early July it will give me enough knowledge to start the real community work.\n\nFirst stream of conscious concerning task 1.\n\n1. Do we want to involve people with money, who could sponsor/finance/support the work of Edgeryders by this post as well? Community is something else than company, but it still does have needs. In this case maybe it would be good to produce two slightly different articles of the same size that would address these groups. Where will they be used? (this will give us a hint).\n\n2. I believe this/these article(s) should contain information about \"projects\" (I hate this word, I need to think of a satisfactory replacement) of Edgeryders- and because the amount of ongoing activities is huge, some of them have to be stressed. I believe that UnMonastery can serve as a great representation of tackling the issue of economical struggle and compromising it with useful work/progress/change. LOTE is extremely important as some kind of alternative to intense meeting based project/funding culture we live in, showing that more effects can be achieved, without wasting money, thanks to better planning and right people included, philosophy involved. And then? I really don't want to decide just by myself;)\n\nOk, this will be it for now.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-05-31 10:46:14", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:17.364656", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 835, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 97], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22210, "user_id": 145, "topic_id": 4840, "post_number": 12, "raw": "<b>am never able to figure out how to keep the font the same size..</b>\n\nis there an option for font sizing?\n\n", "created_at": "2015-10-20 17:36:40", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:03.739110", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 25, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [21048], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27921, "user_id": 129, "topic_id": 1058, "post_number": 13, "raw": "<b>Transformative Literacy </b>\n\nI just lectured\u00a0on societal transformation a couple of weeks ago\u00a0and have come across two modells that might be of interest to the cook book: 1) Transformative Literacy (including technological, economical, insitutional, cultural dimension)\u00a0and 2) Four Levels of Self-Interpretation (including collective self-interpretation, reflexive self-perception, social insitutions and practices and pre-reflexive self/habitus).

For me, the big question is a \u201cwhy\u201d question. You invite me to meet other like-minded people, activist, exchange ideas and work together. Fine. I'm very interested in that. But then you ask me to first to handle a kind of bureaucracy, to sign up for something I don't know yet, I haven't had a chance to talk to anyone about yet. WHY?

But demanding to sign up with edgeryders as a requirement for the WS BEFORE I have met the people gives me the feeling that signing up for the WS a) is too complicated, it's creating a barrier that isn't necessary </span>and b) not just about signing up, but also about someone else's agenda (convince people to in edgeryders).

And I don't think that I'm the only one who feels that way. </span>I don't intent to say that edgeryders is a bad initiative \u2013 I am sure that everyone who signed up is truly motivated - or you are doing something entirely wrong.<span> My intention is to give you feedback, to help you understand, why another group of people, which is also very active and motivated, does NOT sign up. Increasing the number of updates or infos won't help to reach out to that group of people and convince them to sign up. Removing the barrier on signing up might. Now, it would be dishonest to claim that the \u201cregister with edgeryders first\u201d policy is the only thing that stops from signing up.</span> <span>Two other reasons are that April is already too overloaded with work and conferences, and the other is that I personally already am busy enough with the projects I already have, and I don't have that much capacity to do more (which would without any doubt happen if I meet too many another motivated people ) </span>Ok, enough feedback and personal opinion.

If we win, this is my price\". Of course, it's useless to go for this if the 100.000\u20ac are going to be used to run the race to the eventual victory: in my view, we shouldn't ensure less than\u00a075K to the unMonastery once we ensure\u00a0on a speculative basis a sum for the speaches (say, 300-400\u20ac/speach), the graphic design, the social media strategy, the videos, ecc., plus the\u00a0project management and the Edgeryders %. I am willing to take the lead on the project management, if there is a small team I can rely on, both in Edgeryders and Matera2019. This last point is crucial to me: there has to be some explicit interest on their side, as well as a direct involvement of Raffaella both in Social Media support and in videos of local heroes (school kids or artists). In the end, this stuff will remain to the Comitte (who, by the way, is the official promoter of the project, even on the platform).\n\n2. We're inviting potentially the whole Internet community to our streamed videos on how to challenge business plans. Our own little version of Ted talks. But we're offering it for free. We're not asking for votes, we're building capacity. However, there should be a contast call to action which leads to the page of the Che Fare bid where people can vote. In other words, this is like a fundraising campaign to gather votes which goes viral because we are actually producing knowledge collaboratively. We can also simplify point 1 and make it a series of talks on permaculture, monastic systems, opensource technology, presentation of the unMonastarians, brainstormings on the unMonastarians projects, ecc. But then we remain uncovered for the business plan.\n\n3. Yes, I really do agree on that. The only problem I see as a PM, is that I don't have a specific idea of the ER community, so I don't know how to get to the people who are not following the unMonastery, for example! In Matera I have less problems. Any advice?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-01-21 06:55:23", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:04.502824", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 452, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [21330], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32488, "user_id": 1457, "topic_id": 1782, "post_number": 37, "raw": "<b>Wheels, Cooking area, the Kitchen and the Outside!</b>\n\n<strong>Hello to all!</strong>\n\nI'm truly delighted to get on board Edgeryders!\n\nAnd <strong>excited about participating</strong> in LOTE3! \u00a0:- D\n\nGreat work happening! I'm impressed, surprisingly great!\u00a0\n\nI believe that the design concepts and what as been said above, reuse and recycle approach plus creating flexibility in the use of space through furniture, by allowing the Space to happen and to change as different programs are required or suggested, is really necessary for promoting the process of co-living and co-working.\n\nThought that beside the idea of modularity (loved the links that have been posted) in adition,\u00a0<span>it</span>\u00a0might be a good idea, having the <strong>furniture and the modules on wheels</strong> (with brakes ;-) ), when not being suspended on the wall. It is adaptable as one more piece of the puzzle modules and hopefully in a package might be bargained at an acessible price.\u00a0\n\nThe advantage apart of the ability to be easily modified into different schemes in space, it's also, in practical terms, <strong>incredibly handy when one is vacuuming</strong> or cleaning the floor.\u00a0\n\nAbout the approach of the <strong>outside space</strong>, once there is a <strong>open field nearby</strong>, some of the<strong> movable furniture can step outside</strong> accompanying the movement of the individuals or the community... if transportable.\n\nIt would be great thinking about a light and transportable <strong>module for protection of the Sun (?)\u00a0</strong>and/or the rain, it\u00b4s just an idea, but the open field could work as an extention space for co-working. (easy to lift for transportation, but it had to be in anyway fixable in terms of not being windblown...).\n\nAnother thing is about the <strong>Kitchen</strong>, I believe, <strong>as the Pasta event is making a point</strong>, this space is really an important one, kind like the internal patio in the houses of roman architecture, as here there is no central outdoor space (in the unMonastery), <strong>the Kitchen should be nurtured like a Queen, I say!</strong> and given importance as a space of meeting and promoting the creation of relations and consequently possible good ideas! I believe there is be the possibility to have a big table for meals... and that is really good, I think.\u00a0\n\nI would like to understand better the ideas for the cooking area, the working place of a kitchen, might not be so flexible, I mean, it will probably need to be design at a more deep level than the rest of the furniture, just like the case of WCs... right? in this drawings (don't have enought info - I'm at the moment with a technical detail that doesn\u00b4t allow me to open the dwg), but the<strong> cooking area doesn\u00b4t seem to be spacious enough.. and might be equipped in a way to better promote this collective yummy ritual of basic nutrition.</strong>\u00a0\n\n(One more detail.. sorry!\u00a0Maybe the bathroom in the kitchen, could be acessed from the corner of room 3, don't know if this wall is a structural one, but if not possible, wouldn't it be important <strong>not having a strait relation between the WC door from the area where the cooking and food are circulating</strong>... again, if I well understood the drawing...)\n\nI'm really interested in participating in the activity \"Venue\", but maybe because I'm new here, and still trying to keep up with the struture of the website it self, couldn\u00b4t find exactly where I can express this availability! (if anyone could help me, it would be great).\n\n<strong>Let's keep working! ;- )\u00a0</strong>\n\nRita\n\n", "created_at": "2013-08-12 13:17:09", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:58.465882", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 668, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 747, "user_id": 3415, "topic_id": 714, "post_number": 1, "raw": "I have been a kindergarten teacher in public schools for 22 years. Looking back at my childhood, I was surrounded by my village\u2019s scents, friendly voices and the care of the neighborhood. Having this background, I moved on to study pedagogics, eventually becoming a wife and mother of three children. Since then, my constant self-discovery voyage with pupils, parents, and teachers who never stop learning and reforming is still going on.\n\nThe \u201cTree of Life\u2019 is the outcome of my fulfilled dream in building an extraordinary school in nature. A place where learning is accomplished experientially, in harmony and interaction with the natural environment, aiming to lead children on a wonderful quest.\u00a0The \"Tree of Life\u201d is a non-profit organization founded in June 2013. The idea was born from a group of people coming from different walks of life, who as citizens and as parents share similar concerns and dreams for the next generation. The world with values, morals, respect for fellow human beings and the environment, faith in the teamwork and creating. \u2018Together we can change our world\u2026\u2019 is the motto of our association in an effort to stress the anthropocentric aspect of life. \u00a0Our vision is to train a group of people who will form the core of a community where teamwork is based on creativity, meritocracy and joy rather than apathy, ignorance, indifference, and irresponsibility. The world that dares, cares, dreams, contests, and helps, and is doing so by changing whatever it doesn\u2019t like, and at any cost. The common denominator of this endeavor is the need for collaboration, solidarity, and offering without expecting personal benefits, the urge to defy fatigue and readiness to reduce one\u2019s \u201cvaluable\u201d personal time. Through our actions, we expect to restart - both financially as well as mentally. We believe that every problem has a solution and every day we keep working on this.\n\nOur team focuses on financial aid to minority groups, supporting vulnerable cases involving children and raising awareness of Municipalities and other Public Bodies. Moreover, we intend to encourage mobilization, action and contribution through promotion, education and entertainment and turn on the power of \"We\" despite the difficulties of our times. All actions of the association are dedicated to a specific purpose, with priority given to children and other vulnerable socio-economic groups. The unstable economic environment has eroded the values of our society, thereby the willingness of these groups to mobilize and diversify has waned. Some of our hitherto actions include support of orphanages and families facing life problems by collecting clothes, shoes, emergency supplies and food in cooperation with local churches. We have a project for interactive visual toy organization for children of 6-11 years and we created the Blood Bank \"Tree of Life\" in the Hippocrates Hospital of Thessaloniki. Several activities aim for personal development and increasing outreach, such as educational excursions, storytelling, drama therapy workshops, seminars with psychologists and renowned speakers, education and radio broadcasts. The \u2018Tree of Life\u2019 also features \u2018Lifecycle\u2019, a theatrical group composed of 35 volunteers, organizing theatrical performances in order to generate income for vulnerable social groups and communities.\u00a0\n\nThe beneficiaries of the \u2018Tree of Life\u2019 are:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>pupils who learn by their parents\u2019 actions and who are identified by themselves and not by what they are doing.</li>\n\n<li>local communities getting inspired by the voluntary actions of the association.</li>\n\n<li>parents who get activated in order to interact with each other, contribute to their creativity and charity to people in need, irrespective of their personal hurdles.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nA dedicated <a href=\"http://dentrozois.org/\">website</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/%CE%94%CE%AD%CE%BD%CF%84%CF%81%CE%BF-%CE%96%CF%89%CE%AE%CF%82/210448719133991\">Facebook page</a> include all information that needs to be transferred to potential beneficiaries.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-18 15:16:41", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 11:01:50.146641", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 663, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17046, "user_id": 217, "topic_id": 2796, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>sure</b>\n\nI can send you guys a high quality version of the video or the raw video of particular shots if there's anything you need?\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-23 05:21:06", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:35.166551", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 30, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [14136], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19677, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5449, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>As far as ER is concerned</b>\n\nOk, so, Marco authorizes us to publish.

What is hidden behind this new concept of green economy: green growth? green capitalism? something else? What conclusions should we draw from these twenty years, while environmental degradation has accelerated, inequalities have widened and that democracies are being undermined? Which alternatives?</em>' Quote from video below by\u00a0<a href=\"http://alter-echos.org\">http://alter-echos.org</a>/\n\nThe <strong>United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development Rio+20</strong> next week will attempt to address the crisis of biodiversity. Since the first conference at\u00a0Rio in 1992 the UN has attempted to protect the natural world with policy initiatives based in a mistaken understanding of our relationship with the natural world.\u00a0Even before the Rio 1992, critical environmentalists where aware of the short-comings of the \u2018sustainable development\u2019 as a methodology for the supposed conservation of nature. David Orton wrote;\n\n<em>Greens and environmentalists who today still use this concept [of sustainable development] display ecological illiteracy. There is a basic contradiction between the finiteness of the Earth, with natural self-regulating systems operating within limits, and the expansionary nature of industrial capitalist society. The language of sustainable development helps mask this fundamental contradiction, so that industrial expansion on a global scale can temporarily continue</em> (1989).\n\nIn short, sustaining or increasing levels of consumption on the diminishing resource base with more people wanting \u2018better\u2019 lifestyles (i.e. more consumption) is not possible in the current context. It is not surprising that environmental problems continue to become more severe as policy makers continue to ignore material realities.\n\nToday we find ourselves at a situation where most of the proposals on the table at Rio+20 will only accelerate problems. Strategies promoting 'the green economy' create new markets within natural processes as a means of protecting nature. But the ecological commons cannot be saved by turning ecological processes into commodities. I will briefly summarize three main reasons why creating commodities out of natural processes will not work to do the important work of protecting ecological systems:\n\n<strong>1) <u>Irreplaceable Nature</u></strong>. It's no small thing to bring nature into the space where everything must prove its financial worth. We simply do not have the scientific capacity to measure all of the life-sustaining services provided by nature. What is possible to know for sure is that there will be no financial system to create this human construct we call money without the benefit of a stable climate, clean water and healthy local ecosystems. The paradox remains that in attempting to protect nature by assigning it's services economic values, we reinforce the idea that the only thing that matters is the economic impact of a particular course of action. 'Priceless' is a concept that is quickly being destroyed as the scope of the market expands.\u00a0\n\n<strong>2) <u>Price Tags as Absurd</u>.</strong> When scientists do fix a price for nature these values are not only always absurdly low, but in the big picture view they are simply ridiculous. Consider the recent <em>The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity</em> (TEEB) report, which estimates a total economic value of insect pollination worldwide at \u20ac153 billion (Gallai et al. 2009 in TEEB, 2010: p.8). It's a high number, but does this number actually reflect the value of pollinating insects? Considering that we are dependent on functioning ecological systems, surely these 'ecosystem services' and the pollinating insects which are a vital part of these ecosystems are in fact priceless.\n\n<strong>3) <u>Quantification, instrumentalism and radical reductionism</u></strong>. Reducing the value of nature to financial terms is an epistemological prelude to violence on a material realm. Nature is more complex than what we can capture through a financial valuations and equations. Over-simplifying the processes of a system on which you are completely dependent is terminally foolish\u00a0- not only for the natural world we claim to want to protect, but for the survival of humankind and our own children. Basic common decency demands that we are more rigourous with our thinking.\n\nI hope we can use our time at Edgeryders to develop proposals to protect the commons that will replace the flawed approaches of 'sustainable development' and now\u00a0the 'green economy'. Acknowledgement of both the crisis conditions in the natural world and the systemic drivers of this crisis in the economic system is the first step towards genuine renewal.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-11 19:04:30", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 00:04:03.441473", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 783, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 30.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11946, "user_id": 93, "topic_id": 1307, "post_number": 3, "raw": "duplicate\n\n", "created_at": "2012-02-15 15:36:25", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:08.442678", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 3, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [10077], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28404, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 3930, "post_number": 13, "raw": "<b>I would prefer not dealing with Materan administration practices</b>\n\nAlso it would be good to start a relationship with the Young foundation.

We create educational and therapeutic games, devices to measure the breathe, and distributed data systems to inform public health practices, and policies.\n\nWe create a commons \u2013 collectively managed resources that are freely accessible and can be used and enriched by everyone \u2013 by spurring collaboration between people affected, caregivers, and passionate professionals to build on the collective intelligence.\n\nThe games produced participatorily are meant to improve the quality and life expectancy of people with respiratory problems \u2013 by educating, transforming therapy into games, and promoting healthy habits. They can be reused and adapted by everyone to address local problems and needs, as long as the free/libre and open-source licences are maintained. We also develop open-source hardware such as flowmeter for domesic use. This material shall enable everyone, in all countries, to get indicators about his health (lung capacity tests), and shall also provide decentralized, anonimyzed data to advance public health research (blockchain/IPFS).\n\nOn top of that we have been building a community of people to further develop and distribute the games. We successfully organized gamejams about cystic fibrosis and asthma in Switzerland and in Canada, and plan other events on breathing health and chronic respiratory diseases in the next months. The audience is huge: 1 out of 5 people in the world suffer from chronic respiratory diseases, and half of them do not follow the therapy as agreed with their caregiver.\n\nKey to the success of this initiative is the socio-economic, non-exclusive model we developed, as well as the platform we use to log contributions and make the collective effort visible. We use agile development methodologies and allow members to self-organise, so that we build on the collective intelligence and transform ideas into sustainable, scalable products and services.\n\nThe participatory, inclusive approach enables us to build research-backed games that also are attractive and fun to play with. Interdisciplinarity helps us gain a multifaceted, holistic vision of healthcare and fosters collaboration between different parties, beyond institutions and countries.\n\nBreathing Games is a signatory of the United Nations Global Compact and of the Open Source Initiative.\n\nDiscover more about us at <a href=\"http://www.breathinggames.net\">www.breathinggames.net</a>\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-08 20:39:00", "updated_at": "2018-05-24 11:01:12.722970", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 437, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 6.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16424, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3109, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Done</b>\n\nMarking done\n\n", "created_at": "2014-10-29 08:47:42", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:32.049649", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 7, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8354, "user_id": 2566, "topic_id": 601, "post_number": 9, "raw": "Thats great, keep following the dropbox link for updated content until we have a proper placeholder website or something.\u00a0\n\nI already contacted Tarek Amr, and it would be great if you could make an introduction to\u00a0<span>Rayna (@MaliciaRouge).

Well, I'll let you on a not-so-surprising secret\u2026it's all about the <strong>connections you make</strong>. And I don't mean connection in the sense of 'my friend's cousin's sister-in-law's father brother knows someone who knows someone' type of connection..but I mean the real honest let's help each other out as best we can kind of bond. As I mentioned before <a href=\"/t/when-the-world-tells-us-we-have-to-be-small-we-have-to-remind-ourselves-that-we-can-be-giants-together-nadia/2871\">here</a>, it's all about the openness, honesty and trust you allow others to see in you, which will inevitably sow the initial seed that will then grow into something beautiful. Don't be ashamed to ask others for help because you will find endless support and it's a guarantee; genuine collaboration will make things happen easily and quickly. Also, accept criticism with grace as it's important to know where the shortcomings lie precisely in order for you to truly prosper.\n\nSo, what kind of 'things' am I referring to above? By 'things' I mean innovative, pioneering and creative solutions individuals are coming up with in response to the hardships they face. In Egypt for example, campaigns such as <a href=\"/t/boss-7awlak-look-around-you/3004\"><strong>'</strong>Bos 7awalek'</a><strong> (Look around you) have sprung out of collaboration; ideas such as the development of </strong><a href=\"/t/topic/2858\">Bahareya Oasis in Egypt</a><strong> were built on collaboration; solutions for </strong><a href=\"/t/futurespotters-egypt-day-2-future-newspaper-challenge/2849/3\">alternative education in Egypt</a><strong> also came out of collaboration; Other great initiatives were highlighted such as </strong><a href=\"/t/solving-energy-problem-in-egypt-by-biogas/2741\">Biogas People</a><a href=\"/wood-works-from-palm-midribs-jozour\">, Jozour</a><strong>, </strong><a href=\"/t/plastex/2722\">Reform Studio, </a><a href=\"/t/changing-the-world/2829\">Mapture,</a> <a href=\"/t/educate-me-redefining-education-in-egypt/2833\">Educate-me</a>,<strong>\u00a0and </strong><a href=\"/t/ayman-nagy/3029\">Harassmap</a><b>; only to name a few.</b>\n\nThrough participating in Spot the Future initiative, UNDP has been learning the Edgeryders methodology in how they are creating a space where futurebuilders from different backgrounds come together and engage in exchanging knowledge, resources and experiences to achieve the same goal: <strong>change</strong>. It was amazing to see it happening online and offline, especially at the futurespotters event in Tbilisi, where connections were being made between the change-makers and exchange in different forms were constantly happening. It was very inspirational to hear about the perspectives and wonderful ideas such as innovative data visualization and storytelling by <a href=\"http://jumpstart.ge/\">Jumpstart Georgia</a><a href=\"/t/market-activism/3006\">, Lasindias</a> and market activism, moneyless bartering solutions such as <a href=\"http://www.makerfox.com/\">Makerfox</a>, movements such as the occupation of <a href=\"/t/futurespotters-video-interview-nick-davitashvili-data-lapauri-in-tbilisi-georgia/2810\">Vake Park</a>, and initiatives such as <a href=\"http://viral.academy/\">Viral Academy</a>, <a href=\"http://wehelp.ge/\">Wehelp in Georgia</a> and <a href=\"/t/carpool-community-in-armenia/2967\">Carpooling</a> in Armenia\u2026seriously, wow. <strong>This is where UNDP needs to, wants to and will be.</strong>\n\nThis experience has been successful in allowing UNDP to identify unique and exciting initiatives and to connect with individuals outside their network. Moreover, it was interesting to see how the futurespotters community was built by mobilizing people on the platform, engaging and linking people from different backgrounds to support one another. UNDP has the power to solve key challenges built on innovation and creativity by searching for local heroes <strong>deep within the well.</strong> You know why? Because there are people out there that have solutions so outside the box and are actually willing to share them. Basically, when you are experiencing something challenging first hand, it will serve as inspiration for you to come up with the solution firsthand.\n\nIt is just as important to engage those people in meaningful conversations to really understand what they need in terms of support and at the end of the day we are all aiming for the same thing, which is development in all spheres of our societies.\n\nWhat I have learned from this experience is that <strong>first: </strong><strong>from a social perspective, organizations should create the space for collaboration to transpire (between individuals and individuals/institutions), by directly engaging citizens. We need to enable the environment for co-creation and collaboration to happen.</strong><strong> Second: </strong><strong>organizations should involve individuals in the actual design and implementation of programmes (co-creation/bottom-up approach) because there are many local heroes we may not know about yet</strong><strong>,</strong> <strong>and third: </strong><strong>trust can be built quickly and can be lost just as quickly, so the notion of 'following-up' with whatever you started is very important; expressing mere intentions, no matter how honest they are, is never enough.</strong>\n\nThese acknowledgements are not easy by the way, it takes time to understand and grasp these ideas and it is easier said than done, and I am still trying to figure out what these concepts mean, and how to make use of them. But taking initiative is important, and this is what UNDP is doing at the moment. By par-taking in initiatives such as Spot the Future, it is certainly a step forward in changing the mindset of the organization and adapting to the new paradigm shift in the world, where individuals are taking charge of their future through Do it Yourself (DIY) approaches, makers movements and relying on one another rather than looking at large institutions for support. <strong>We have the know-how, capacities and resources and it's time to allocate them in the most efficient way possible</strong>, because there are some people out there that are truly struggling to build amazing things for the betterment of the community that can definitely benefit from our support.\n\nWe need to reach out to people other than those on the 'tip of the iceberg'. Change will not be achieved in a blink of an eye, you have to keep pushing the boundaries little by little, <strong>but you must keep pushing.</strong>\u00a0\n\nIn Egypt, we are currently using what we learned and we are putting efforts in engaging with individuals we haven't reached out to before. We are learning the tools of engagement, and we are trying to take out as much as we can from this experience. Let me know if you have any thoughts on <strong>how we can help build this social environment, to empower individuals (those at the very edge) to connect with one another and with organizations to build the best future.</strong>\n\nI would like to personally thank @Nadia, @Noemi, @Matthias and @Alberto for your infinite support and for all your efforts in being open to share your approach and advice. Thanks to all the amazing people I've connected with throughout this experience, especially our Egyptian futurebuilders that we've spotted and all the passionate individuals I've met at the futurespotters event. Thanks for the inspiration! Seriously, keep doing what you're doing, be amazing and i'll see you on the Edge very soon :)\n\n<strong>Remember 384 unique relationships and interactions were created \\#futurespotters!!</strong>\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/f/fbfe6294685aebf889da6feb06f10687f3bc1b9f.JPG\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-07-13 09:06:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:26.587759", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1428, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 2146, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25305, "user_id": 1935, "topic_id": 3221, "post_number": 10, "raw": "<b>updated </b>\n\njust updated my profile to make it based in Cairo .\n\n@Inga if u need help with data entry am on it .\n\n", "created_at": "2014-07-02 15:59:06", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:19.903528", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 28, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [24718], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27826, "user_id": 3597, "topic_id": 791, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>Da AllergoKi a Allergo-risto.

Two of them (Virginia and Giorgio) are\u00a0long-standing\u00a0users, while the third (Flavio) is a more recent member of the community. I thought the \"home field advantage\" would have provided only positive feedbacks, but on the other hand there was also some criticism by those who know well the project and its weak spots. :D\n\nWe're looking forward to your views!\n\n\u00a0\n\n- VIRGINIA\n\n\u00a0\n\nHo incontrato Oilproject per caso nel 2008 con una lezione su Liquida, motore di ricerca italiano per blog. La piattaforma era in una delle sue fasi intermedie: video in diretta col docente e chat fra utenti. E' stata una bella scoperta perch\u00e9 la qualit\u00e0 mi \u00e8 parsa subito alta, e in pi\u00f9 era divertente! Adoravo la chat, trovandola uno strumento ottimo per far emergere curiosit\u00e0 ed opinioni, andando oltre le normali timidezze di un contesto faccia a faccia.\n\nQuella prima lezione ha prodotto anche un piccolo miracolo, che continuo a citare da anni come una storia esemplare delle virt\u00f9 della Rete. Grazie alla possibilit\u00e0 di chattare con le altre persone, entrai in contatto con una utente particolarmente disponibile e competente, che si rivel\u00f2 poi essere lei stessa docente su Oilproject nonch\u00e9 avvocato, con cui sono ancora in contatto diretto e che mi ha aiutato pi\u00f9 di una volta con pareri professionali su temi che nulla c'entravano con quell'antica, prima lezione.\n\nSapevo che Oilproject era nato come scuola di informatica, ma l'ho visto mutare piuttosto velocemente. Da allora, mi sono trovata a seguire lezioni su copyright, neutralit\u00e0 della rete, crimini informatici, ricerca scientifica, temi economici e di attualit\u00e0. E' cambiata la piattaforma ma non lo spirito: si \u00e8 perso forse qualcosa nella naturalezza delle prime chat aperte e multidirezionali, e si \u00e8 acquistato qualcosa in ordine e in... democrazia, con la possibilit\u00e0 di porre domande scritte ma col vincolo di far decidere agli altri utenti quale domanda sia ritenuta pi\u00f9 interessante.\n\nOilproject resta divertente, il che mi pare il succo della vicenda, perch\u00e9 mi permette di informarmi su temi anche molto lontani dalle mie competenze, di farlo gratis, di farlo con un livello di coinvolgimento che posso decidere volta per volta, di fare anche domande che mi sembrano sciocche, di andare e venire mentre la lezione \u00e8 in corso, di twittare i miei commenti o di starmene zitta come un pesce. Ed essendo divertente, mi permette- diciamo con una bassissima soglia all'ingresso- di avvicinarmi a persone con sguardi diversi dal mio, che nella realt\u00e0 non incontrerei mai: un economista, un esponente della Guardia di finanza, un pornodivo. E scoprire che l'economista capisce i problemi di una persona con uno stipendio da operaio, il finanziere non \u00e8 affatto un ottuso cacciatore di hacker, e il pornodivo parla dei problemi della pirateria nel suo settore industriale come si potrebbe fare per la musica o per gli ebook.\n\nDi mestiere faccio la bibliotecaria, quindi una certa deformazione professionale in favore dell'apprendimento ce l'ho! Ma se dovessi dire oggi che penso che il libro e la parola scritta siano gli strumenti principali per l'apprendimento, esiterei un po'. O, almeno, esiterei a dire che lo possano essere da soli.\u00a0Non riesco ad immaginare del tutto come sia l'essere giovani e poter imparare anche con strumenti come Oilproject. Tutta la mia formazione scolastica si \u00e8 svolta nel mondo precedente al web, in una parodia degli studi di belle lettere riservati un tempo ai giovani di buona famiglia. Certamente non augurerei a nessuno di tornare ad allora.\n\nLa mia esperienza con Oilproject resta comunque quella di una persona adulta, e l'uso che ne faccio \u00e8 a cavallo fra l'intrattenimento intellettuale e l'aggiornamento continuo. Effettivamente, molto pi\u00f9 di quanto sia possibile ottenere dalla maggioranza degli altri media a mia disposizione!\n\n\u00a0\n\n- FLAVIO\n\n\u00a0\n\nCirca un anno fa mi sono imbattuto in Oilproject, cercando dei tutorial per Photoshop. Anche se i video trovati mi erano risultati utili e la piattaforma sembrava interessante, leggere nella descrizione \u201cscuola virtuale\u201d mi ha fatto poi fuggire e tenere lontano dal sito per tutti i mesi estivi.\n\nDestino ha voluto, per\u00f2, che le ultime settimane di agosto mi sia ammalato piuttosto seriamente, tanto da perdere- avanti e indietro tra ospedale e casa- quasi tre mesi di scuola.\n\nLa prolungata \u201cvacanza\u201d si \u00e8 rivelata dura non soltanto per la malattia in s\u00e8: mi mancava uscire, gli amici, addirittura qualche professore e- incredibile ma vero- mi mancava studiare! A tutto ci\u00f2, si aggiungeva il timore del carico di studio che avrei trovato una volta tornato in classe, specie da parte del mio prof. di italiano (in grado di farti scrivere in media dieci pagine di appunti in un'ora di spiegazione).\n\nE' stato cos\u00ec che, mosso da una strana nostalgia per lo studio e da una buona dose di paura, ho iniziato a seguire le mie prime lezioni di letteratura su Oilproject, cominciando da Leopardi e Manzoni: sulla scrivania il libro aperto sulle pagine dello \u201cZibaldone\u201d e dell'\u201cAdelchi\u201d, il mio quaderno di appunti e il pc con l'analisi del testo in video. Uno dei vantaggi maggiori \u00e8 sicuramente stato il non poter pi\u00f9 ricevere rimproveri da parte di mia madre (del tipo \u201cstaccati dal computer e mettiti a studiare\u201d).\n\nAnche se non tutti i \u201cprof.\u201d virtuali sono riusciti a farmi appassionare all'argomento, ho comunque apprezzato diversi aspetti di quest'esperienza (del tutto nuova e da scoprire), come il potermi collegare in qualsiasi momento, stoppare e mandare il video avanti e indietro secondo le mie esigenze, fare domande e confrontarmi con gli altri studenti del sito.\n\nUna volta tornato tra i banchi del mio liceo, ho continuato a frequentare Oilproject per motivi diversi e, a volte, molto poco scolastici, come ad esempio alcune videolezioni di Storia della musica rock (Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd).\n\nIn questi giorni mi preparo all'esame di maturit\u00e0 e sono riuscito a recuperare il tempo perso, anche se a costo di qualche sacrificio (come la gita all'estero). La piattaforma continua ad essermi di aiuto e l'ho suggerita anche ad altri compagni. L'unica vera pecca \u00e8 la mancanza di contenuti su varie materie- per me decisamente pi\u00f9 ostiche, come matematica e fisica- che oggi mi sarebbero davvero utili.\n\n\u00a0\n\n- GIORGIO\n\n\u00a0\n\nEra il 2005 quando lessi un articolo su Punto Informatico riguardo una scuola on-line gratuita dedicata ad argomenti informatici, chiamata Oilproject (al tempo acronimo di \u201cOpen Informatic Lessons\u201d): riguardava il mio campo ed era qualcosa che cercavo da tempo. Cos\u00ec, incuriosito, cominciai a frequentare le lezioni di Linux.\n\nL'idea non fu una novit\u00e0 per me, che- da appassionato informatico autodidatta- avevo sempre imparato attraverso forum, manuali, blog e siti vari. Fino a quel momento, per\u00f2, lo avevo fatto in solitudine leggendo, provando e ricondividendo le mie esperienze tramite il mio sito. Dal 1997 (anno in cui iniziai ad usare Internet) ad allora avevo sempre preferito i classici manuali, da scaricare e leggere off-line; del resto non avendo ancora l'ADSL non potevo essere sempre connesso, visti i costi spropositati di una connessione dial-up. Ma quell'anno avevo attivato finalmente l'ADSL e quindi mi fu possibile anche provare ad ascoltare qualche lezione in diretta.\n\nIn passato avevo provato anche a seguire le lezioni universitarie trasmesse in tv dal consorzio universitario Nettuno, ma decisi di smettere in favore di qualcosa di meno istituzionale e di pi\u00f9 pratico.\n\nIn questo senso, la scoperta di Oilproject fu particolarmente positiva. Ritrovarsi con altre persone con le stesse passioni e interessi senza dover stravolgere la propria vita, lavorativa o di studio, \u00e8 un'opportunit\u00e0 di per s\u00e8 imperdibile. Fino ad allora pensavo che ci\u00f2 fosse possibile solo a Milano e nelle altre grandi citt\u00e0 accademiche, ma grazie ad Internet, seppur con modalit\u00e0 diverse, scoprii che si poteva fare.\n\nLe lezioni allora erano tenute solo in audio: per comunicare utilizzavamo un programmino (Teamspeak) molto funzionale, ma per i meno esperti pi\u00f9 difficile da configurare. Si parlava uno alla volta (il docente di turno) ma c'era sempre la possibilit\u00e0 di fare domande tramite la chat sul sito o tramite il canale IRC sui server di azzurra, che io preferivo.\n\nSuccessivamente nel 2006 seguii il corso di CCNA, e in questa occasione fui coinvolto attivamente -seppur come discente- a collaborare, registrando le lezioni volta per volta ed editandole per renderle fruibili successivamente. Da qui nacque il progetto di archiviazione di tutti i contenuti.\n\nOggi, come si pu\u00f2 vedere, Oilproject \u00e8 cresciuto tantissimo; le lezioni riguardano gli argomenti pi\u00f9 disparati, dall'economia alla scienza, passando per la letteratura e la musica, e si svolgono in due modi: alcune registrate, altre in diretta video e chat testuale, con la possibilit\u00e0 per entrambi di votare le domande pi\u00f9 interessanti.\n\nIn conclusione non credo che l'e-learning possa sostituire la formazione tradizionale face-to-face, ma che sia necessario incontrarsi. Sono tante, poi, le situazioni in cui questo modello pu\u00f2 essere adottato come complementare e alternativo: per la formazione continua e specializzata degli adulti, per i ragazzi con problemi di mobilit\u00e0.\n\nCertamente un progetto come Oiproject, che dura da anni, \u00e8 un esempio di come la condivisione della conoscenza sia il nostro futuro.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-13 15:37:27", "updated_at": "2018-06-03 06:12:20.751350", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1774, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7164, "user_id": 9, "topic_id": 1979, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Quick Response</b>\n\nThe original building we were going to have was a call center, described by Alberto as:\u00a0\n\n\"<span>It is a former call center, property of the city itself: renovated, used for a few years, then abandoned again, but still in good condition.

As we were a virtual team (mainly working cross-countries in our bedrooms), we asked for precisions about the challenge and got multiple persons involved, answering quickly and efficiently.\n\nCoincidently enough, we just received a mail concerning a Kennedy Space Center contest or i don't know what. We need to produce a 2 min video and 100 words text for monday, 20. This can be done in less than half an hour, i'll just send an e-mail beforehand to express that our intentions are not to participate in any contest, but to show our work to profesionals.\n\nI may start working on it this afternoon, so hopefully, you won't have to watch a long presentation, but a fast-pased two minutes video.\n\nI really felt that the spaceappschallenge was genuine and a great success.\n\nMany scientists express their needs of funds, and the bootstrapping of lunar economy challenge is a real potential. The idea would be to get self-replicating machines up there that are autonomous. We can do it. I'd even say we need it.\n\nAt the pace technology actually evolves, where will we find rare minerals to ameliorate our connectivity and capacities ?\n\nContinue mining to death mother earth with slaves ?\n\nThat's the kind of strategy we need to figure out right now.\n\nPolitics have a ten year memory (at least in france) : 5 years forward, 5 years backward.\n\nAnd its software is outdated since something like 100 years ago ?\n\nmaybe 30 ?\n\nMaybe it has always been outdated, and we constantly update it by creating software and hardware to cover our ever-evolving needs ?\n\nProjects like a space industry isn't the responsibility of politics. It's ours.\n\nAnd it's our choice to make it happen, or not.\n\nWhat we have tried to show in our presentation, is that :\n\n- it is doable in a P2P manner involving individuals to governments and agencies\n\n- netention is designed to organise such interactions and also to make simulations, hence allowing to collectively design the best strategy.\n\n- it can be fun and intuitive\n\n- there are tons of ways to contribute to space exploration that can have an immediate impact on earth. Space is more inhospitable than Earth. So if we know how to survive and travel for cheap up there, we know how to thrive down there. As above, so below. Makes sense ?\n\n- ...\n\nAlso, we had lots of fun. Seems like nothing, but being aware that thousands of individuals towards the globe are working with you to contribute to the space exploration effort is really something. :)\n\nMoreover, we collaborated with other projects : <a href=\"http://climateviewer.com/\">ClimateViewer</a> and <a href=\"http://cesium.agi.com/\">Cesium</a>, which are now (almost) merged with <a href=\"http://www.netention.org/\">netention</a>, and made a visually pleasant presentation that appeared to become the basis of the other presentations you will find on the website that we have produced since.\n\nThis really inspired us, and made us work effectively in a friendly atmosphere while learning and dreaming of space travel. Since then, we have just continued on the same pace.\n\nDreaming is awesome, maye some kind of cheap drug, and when you work on your dreams with other dreamers, the trip has no ends but an amazing path.\n\nI guees you know pretty well that feeling. ;)\n\nFinally, this lead me to find ways to express what i've been working on.\n\nI learnt a whole lot of stuff this last year, and it's starting to aggregate in forms that may be more digestible and comprehensive than what i shared a year ago.\n\nActually, i say exactly the same stuff than a year ago, than twelve years ago...\n\nI'm just learning more adequate words and processes with time.\n\nAny feedback is more than welcome, it can only help me embrace new perspectives, which is most of my \"quest\".\n\nA new blog : <a href=\"http://nirgalhel.blogspot.fr/\">Nirgal's Logs</a>\n\nThe \"themes\" :\n\n<span>Mind Wandering - Conscious Exploration - NetAlchemy - Cyber-Shamanism - Semantic Healing</span>\n\nTwo video channels :\n\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/NakedMindProtocol\">NakedMindTV</a>\n\nIntroduction to the <a href=\"http://p2pfoundation.net/NakedMind\">Naked Mind Protocol</a> which consists basically on an attempt to define a communication protocol that allows the exchange of private data and a collective processing aka a form of P2P therapy.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/SemantiCure\">SemantiCure</a>\n\nExperimental Semantic Healing.

And, luckly, there are many others people who are agree with me, like the members of Addipizzo.\n\nAddiopizzo is a non-partisan movement and a volunteer association that opposes the Mafia System.\n\nIt promotes a virtuous economic system free from the control of the Mafia through a project called \" Critical Consumption\".\n\n(One of the means through which the Mafia controls the economy is the so-called \u201dpizzo\u201d: every month great part of the entrepreneurs, merchants etc. have to pay a sum of money to the Mafia in order to defend their activity from retaliations of the Mafia like robberies, fires etc.So literally the name of the association means \u201cgoodbye pizzo\u201d)\n\nThe association was born in Palermo in 2004 by a group of 7 young people and then in Catania in 2006.the first activity of the group was to place stickers on the walls of the city with the words \"an entire people who pay pizzo \u00a0is a people without dignity\". This was the group's presentation to the city.\n\n\u201cWe are motivated by idealism, enthusiasm, anger and pride. And the worry about the difficulties that we will create the mafia when we get to the places of production and decision of the Sicily\u201d they said in a letter published on a national newspaper.\n\nThis presentation caused an immediate reaction: a few days later also in other 5 sicilian cities the stickers were placed on the walls.\n\nThe stickers are one of the tools that Addiopizzo is continuing to use in order to sensibilize the population and it is possible downloading them from the web. So everyone can be able to do this sensibilization activity.\n\nIn recent years the activitys of Addiopizzo is divided between two projects: Critical Consumption and \u00a0Schools Project.\n\n<strong>Critical Consumption</strong> is a project that wants to support merchants who do not submit to the extortion racket, creating a network of aware consumers who commit themselves to go to those merchants for their purchases.\n\nThe initiative combats the extorsions addressing a interlocutor never considered before: the consumer.\n\nIf the consumer buys from those who pay protection money, funds the Mafia. Many citizens aren\u2019t aware of this.\n\nThe project is divided into two phases: collect signatures of citizens, drawing up the list of merchants' \u201cpizzo free \"to be presented to the citizens.\n\nAddiopizzo thus seeks to eliminate the possibility of isolation of those who make a difficult choice and encourage those who have not yet denounced.\n\n<strong>Schools Project</strong>: organization of meeting in the schools about legal education with the participation of judges, anti-racket associations and entrepreneurs who have rebelled against the extortion racket.\n\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"imagecache-Featured\" src=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/sites/edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/files/imagecache/Featured/addiopizzo5.jpeg\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 181px;\" title=\"\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"imagecache-Featured\" src=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/sites/edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/files/imagecache/Featured/pizzofree.png.jpg\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 182px;\" title=\"\">\n\n\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m one of the citizens engaged in a critical consumption. It is only a little action, but I think that it is extremely useful.\n\nA few days ago I interviewed Salvatore, one of the founder of Addiopizzo Catania, and Irene, a member of the association.\n\n<strong>IRENE, 25 years old, student</strong>\n\n<strong>Why did you become a member of Addiopizzo?</strong>\n\nI admired the group so much and then I decided to come in action and it has been a revolution in my life: Addiopizzo has been giving a deep sense to my life because I\u2019m feeling useful, with a biggest and highest goal than the only living. I\u2019m celebrating also the better men of my island.\n\nThe meeting with Addiopizzo was one of the most important in my life.\n\n<strong>Do you feel in danger for what you do?</strong>\n\nNo, I don\u2019t. I\u2019ve never felt in danger, also because I am not in danger. 20 years ago Libero Grassi ( an entrepreneur) died because was the only one who didn\u2019t want to pay the pizzo, but today with Addiopizzo there are\u00a0 600 merchants in Sicily who claim that they don\u2019t submit to blackmail of the Mafia. And so\u2026 why would I feel in danger?\n\nThere is a sentence of Goethe that says \u201c the fear knocked the door, the courage opened, but there was nobody\u201d\n\n<strong>SALVATORE, 42 years, policeman</strong>\n\n<strong>How do you support yourself?</strong>\n\nMy work for Addiopizzo is volunteer. I'm a cop. The coordination of the 2 work is difficult because I'm working in a investigation department, so time is often difficult to predict and I have also a family.\n\n<strong>How\u00a0 was Addiopizzo Catania borned?</strong>\n\nAddiopizzo Catania was born in 2006. We were 30 at that time . We began, as in palermo, with sticking to the walls of adhesives and then we have been developped a serious of projects. Today the association has 20 members.\n\nWith Addiopizzo Palermo we\u2019re sharing some projects like \u201ccritical consumption\u201d, but we are more engaged in the social field with the project \u201c give a smile! \u201c. We take care of the so called \u201cinvisibles\u201d in the city and every year we organize also a lottery whose income goes to charity. This year the lottery\u2019s income will be given to a girl paraplegic following his involvement in a mafia shootout while she was going out from the university.\n\n<strong>What does your family think about your engagement for Addiopizzo?</strong>\n\nI have the totally support of my family. I couldn\u2019t do anything without the endorsement of my wife.\n\n<strong>Why do you engage your time for Addiopizzo?</strong>\n\nIn Sicily we are very good to complain , but if you ask to someone \u201cwhat are you doing to change the situation?\u201d, few of us can say that we are engaging effectively doing something.\n\nI have a 4 years old son and when you will grow up, I want to tell him that his father was a policeman and that I did something for our homeland. So I hope that my son will live in a better environment and will engage to improve it for his children.\n\n<strong>What is the relationship between Addiopizzo and the institutions? Do you think that you are working instead of them?</strong>\n\nNo, I don\u2019t think so. Our action is a stimulus. We are a goad for the institutions.\n\nWe have extremely good relationships above all with the Prefecture and the Prosecutor. They are often with us in the schools. The Catania Province gave us a financial aid to refurbish our head office that is a structure confiscated from the Mafia.\n\n<strong>Do you feel in danger?</strong>\n\nNo! There isn\u2019t a danger because is only a common thought that the merchants who denounce, risk their life. The risck exist if only one denounces , but if they are a group all became more simple and less dangerous. Nobody of us feels in danger... (silence...) We aren\u2019t heroes. We are only a group of guys who loves Sicily and we do what we think being right and due to improve this territory for our children.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-03-10 21:05:32", "updated_at": "2017-09-13 08:10:49.548383", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1353, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 231.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18371, "user_id": 100, "topic_id": 1246, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Que peuvent faire le philosophe et l'Op Gouv</b>\n\nBonsoir Lyne,\n\nJe pratique une philosophie qui se rattache \u00e0 la philosophie g\u00e9n\u00e9rique, c'est-\u00e0-dire une philosophie qui n'est en rien la science des sciences, en rien la connaissance ultime \u00e0 propos de toutes les connaissances. Elle est une bonne compagne qui permetde regarder, ou d'organiser ce que nous percevons d'une autre fa\u00e7on dans le cadre d'une exploration de l'humain. Si j'utilise un mod\u00e8le simple de l'humain, l'humain en tant que nature \u00e0 comprendre ne nous est pas donn\u00e9 d'une mani\u00e8re \u00e9vidente. Il faut aussi l'exposer, savoir utiliser, etc.\n\nCeci \u00e9tant, pour agir philosophiquement \u00e0 propos des situations probl\u00e9matiques que vous d\u00e9crivez, je dirais qu'il faut \u00e0 la fois en faire un ou des mod\u00e8les et utiliser des mod\u00e8les d\u00e9j\u00e0 construit pour voir si nous pouvons comprendre ce qui se passe en mieux. Typiquement, et sans introduire de la psychologie dans la philosophie que je pratique, \"quelqu'un qui ne change pas son mode d'action\" devrait d'abord \u00eatre saisi par un mod\u00e8le. Ici, par exemple, on pourrait utiliser celui du \"verrouillage cognitif\". Les cognitivistes montrent que lorsqu'un acteur est verrouill\u00e9 sur une tache, rien d'ext\u00e9rieur \u00e0 la situation, ne peut p\u00e9n\u00e9trer dans le syst\u00e8me cognitif. Donc un politique qui ne veut pas changer son mode de leadership pourrait \u00eatre verrouill\u00e9 sur sa tache. Maintenant on regarde si ce mod\u00e8le nous a appris un peu plus sur la situation expos\u00e9e que ce que l'on connaissait pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment. Voil\u00e0 un d\u00e9but de que l'on pourrait faire.\n\nQuant \u00e0 l'OP Gouv, son \u00e9nonc\u00e9 m\u00eame devrait donner lieu \u00e0 une mod\u00e9lisation graphique des acteurs, de leurs r\u00f4les sous forme de Sc\u00e8ne (j'ai d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 un mmod\u00e8le-concept \u00e0 se sujet). Mon mod\u00e8le, la Sc\u00e8ne esth\u00e9tique, qui a aussi \u00e9volu\u00e9 sous la forme Sc\u00e8ne esth\u00e9tique/Sc\u00e8ne politique (avec le professeur Franck Tannery), en dehors de la mod\u00e9lisation pr\u00e9cise de la situation des acteurs et du fonctionnement de leurs relations, affirme qu'\u00e0 chaque instant tout corps, tout acteur participe \u00e0 plusieurs sc\u00e8nes, occupant en elle des r\u00f4les simultan\u00e9ment diff\u00e9rents. Je ne dis pas que c'est un bon mod\u00e8le pour repr\u00e9senter l'Op Gouv, mais il est plus riche que celui de Goffman, plus proche de ce qui est mod\u00e9lis\u00e9 ailleurs, par exemple \u00e0 la NASA, pour les relations des astronautes entre eux et avec un centre de contr\u00f4le. Donc \u00e7a oblige \u00e0 tester des d\u00e9finitions de l'Op. Gouv.\n\nL'objectif est de produire partout de la vari\u00e9t\u00e9 de connaissances, d'explications, de formes, et tester leur existence d'une mani\u00e8re continue.\n\nEt puis il y a les mod\u00e8les et ensuite il faut aller du c\u00f4t\u00e9 des applications comme lorsqu'on passe par exemple des mod\u00e8les physiques, physico-chimiques de la mati\u00e8re aux pratiques industrielles pour la fa\u00e7onner, la dompter, etc.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2011-11-23 18:39:01", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:42.632808", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 503, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18403, "user_id": 117, "topic_id": 1593, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Arrow's theorem</b>\n\nYou can't have Gibbard-Satterthwaite without Arrow. :-)\n\nIt's not impossible... it's just difficult.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-14 23:57:11", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:42.791890", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 25, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26603, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5398, "post_number": 12, "raw": "<b>Great job!</b>\n\nYou guys in Milano rock.

Some points, although they now seem intuitive, have left an enduring impression on me: they are constructive lessons, as opposed to those simply confirming bleak diagnosis - e.g. latest update from the International Labor Organization which you can easily find <a href=\"http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/@ed_emp/@emp_elm/@trends/documents/publication/wcms_165455.pdf\">here</a>.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>young people bring added value to some fields of work.

In a short time the populations of small countries in the region, Lebanon and Jordan, have grown manyfold (1.1 Million refugees in Lebanon, 630,000 in Jordan - in addition to Palestinian refugees already there). Some reading materials with up to date, detailed information:\n\n<strong>Armenia:</strong> <a href=\"/t/refugee-care-system-in-armenia-and-how-to-improve-it/5009\">Anna\u2019s report from Yerevan</a> is a good introduction. \n\n<strong>Jordan:</strong> <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2ulC5rjYSncOTRoZThTWlljWk0/view?usp=sharing\">Five Years On | Syria Crisis-related needs and vulnerabilities in Jordan</a>.  \n\nWhile many of the cities and towns receiving refugees face similar challenges there is a significant difference. <strong>Some are transit locations, which asylum seekers pass on their way on to other destinations</strong>. <strong>They include major cities in Greece, Italy and Turkey, as well as small coastal towns </strong>from which people leave on boats to take their perilous journey across the sea. There, volunteers do their best to care for their immediate physical needs and the mandated administrative/security procedures to grant them entry onto the mainland.\n\n<strong>Other cities and towns  are receiving the newcomers on a more long term basis.</strong> This happens <strong>in two different phases</strong>, each one posing its own  political, administrative and infrastructural challenges for the hosting communities. The first one is the <strong>period of time between arrival and the approval or rejection of the person\u2019s application for refugee status</strong>. This period could be very long, as in the case of the Palestinian refugees in Jordan, or that of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/10/14/meet-the-eritrean-refugee-who-stands-for-everything-that-can-go-wrong-with-asylum-applications/\">Mr. Teferi in Norway</a>. The second one is the <strong>period that starts what happens once individual has secured refugee status</strong>. In this period, the challenge is navigating the difficult period between receiving the papers and being fully established in the social and economic life of the host new community.\n\nWhile the details differ, the problems and needs mentioned by mayors, NGOs and activists fall into one or more of the following:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Resource efficiency: How to get better at covering necessities of both refugees and citizens/ residents on very limited resources?</strong> As an example Jordan is one of the most water scarce countries in the world and 70 per cent of the population suffers from inadequate water supply below the national standard of 100 liters/person/day. Aging infrastructures, inefficiencies in operation and maintenance. interrupted provision of water services etc. <strong>Could resource scarcity be mitigated through Open Source technologies for recycling of sewage, seawater desalination at scale, deep drip irrigation etc?</strong> Affordable, modifiable technologies are required to manage the current crisis as well as <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/01/22/3191081/dangerous-climate-change-impact/\">to secure peace in the region</a>.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Interoperability, knowledge transfer and Institutional memory:</strong> I heard many calls to \u201cmake information available about how the system works\u201d, and \"calls for online platforms to fix a perceived lack of information\" thought to be a \"key obstacle for labor market access\". Here too I head that \u201cwe need a database of all the initiatives and resources available to help refugees\u201d and \"we need to make existing information about getting your paperwork done, how to set up a new business etc\". <strong>There are</strong> <strong>three underlying assumptions</strong>: 1) That some people understand in detail \u201chow the system works\u201d as a whole and 2) That they can transmit that kind knowledge into brochures or documents and that 3) This information material will make the system navigable and penetrable for newcomers. These three assumptions do not hold up to scrutiny and could fill an entire blogpost with reasons as to why. For now I will simply refer you to the <a href=\"http://www.brickstarter.org/Brickstarter.pdf\">Brickstarter report</a> as it is a light, beginner-friendly introduction to some of the issues.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Scalability of public services: How to build/rethink provision of public services so that they can accommodate changes in the number of people to serve? </strong>Many of the participants complained about the lack of resources to provide education or training for newcomers. Others mentioned the provision of health and social care services, especially psychological support for the traumatised. I heard a lot of calling for more resources to be put into existing services, but little examination of how existing services are performing and even less awareness about more effective, flexible and cost-efficient approaches. <strong>Are we sure that throwing money onto more of the same will result in better outcomes?</strong>  Sugata Mitra\u2019s work on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimally_invasive_education\">Minimally Invasive Education</a>, Miguel Chavez\u2019s experienced from <a href=\"https://media.ccc.de/v/32c3-7540-maker_spaces_in_favelas_-_lecture\">building Makerspaces in Favelas</a>, <a href=\"http://berlin.freifunk.net/index_en/\">Freifunk</a> and many others offer alternative approaches with promising results. The political will, and practical ability, to welcome and accommodate newcomers depends on it. In this <a href=\"/en/opencare/welcome-to-opencare\">recent talk</a>, I present a proposal for how we can break out of the zero-sum thinking in the provision of care services as an antidote to rising social tensions between social groups.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nOne of the outcomes of the conference was that Mayors from Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, Greece, Italy and Austria signed a <a href=\"http://now-conference.org/declaration/\">declaration to work together</a> in solidarity across borders:\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/2/2308ee4564f49cfa274b2ed0ced598f046ad2ca1.jpg\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\">\n\n<strong>Politically, this is an important signal. However the event didn\u2019t get into the part I find the most interesting- <em>how</em> they intend to go from <em>intention</em> to <em>implementation</em>.</strong>\n\n<strong>So what is needed in order for this commitment to be delivered on?</strong> Based on discussions with mayors, activists and refugees described it looks like the participants at NOW need:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Efficient and sustainable coordination across geographic, linguistic and technological barriers.</li>\n\n<li>A globe-spanning sustained effort to help community leaders, mayors, politicians and fight back against populist rhetoric and divisive narratives.</li>\n\n<li>Ability to learn about and experiment with novel or unconventional approaches towards tackling root causes of problems which affect both newcomers and the host communities which welcome them.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<strong>In practice this would require:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Active engagement of a lot of affected people in mapping and making sense of urgent problems related to a sudden influx of newcomers in education, housing, employment/entrepreneurship, language/social skills and finance</strong>. The reason being that those affected will only get behind efforts to solve problems if they trust the people involved, and have shared ownership in the process. Part of what builds trust is if people can recognise their own perspective, language and experiences in the description of the situation. That they are taken seriously as experts in their own lives- that their own <em>ambitions</em>, <em>words</em> and <em>thoughts</em> weigh at least as much as input of credentialed domain experts (who may never have set foot in the neighborhood). This was echoed by newcomers frustrated by discussions about training them to fit into pre-defined slots in society, based on what they perceived to be unfounded assumptions by instutitonal actors about what they could or could not achieve: <em>\u201cDo not put a cap on my dreams, just give me access to the tools and see what I can build with them\u201d.</em></li>\n\n<li><strong>Continuous mapping and connection of different private, public and third sector actors efforts into coherent shared plans</strong> that take into consideration the budgetary, logistical and political constraints within which each group is working. I can tell you from experience that is it not easy. The reason being that the incentives are aligned against it. We all agree that at the system level good documentartion saves everyone time and resources. At the individual level it is more difficult to motivate the additional investment of time and effort. Where you see people doing this consistently is where it is a part of a shared culture and work ethos. So to get this going you have to create the incentives for people to do additional work involved, instill the ethos and teach people the workflow and enforce it top down until there is a critical mass doing it and others can share the effort of spreading and maintaining the cullture.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Take a minute to think about what this means.</strong>\n\n<strong>If the participants in the event want to see the transnational cooperation happen in practice, then they will have to learn to think and work as networks</strong> <strong>of individuals</strong> interacting inside, outside and all around different organisations. Each working at the hyperlocal, micro-level, while sharing and learning with others working in different contexts as a natural part of the everyday workflow\u2026 not just something afforded to people who can travel and spend 2 days talking with one another at a conference. And all of this done <strong>in</strong> <strong>ways that build granular, immediately relevant and continuously updated institutional memory accessible to all.</strong> Affecting behavioral change at this scale is hard, but it can be done.\n\nI think <strong>we can contribute in two ways.</strong>\n\n1. <strong>At LOTE5 we are organising this <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/179569975738885/\">reflexive design exercise on Collaborative inclusion: how migrants-residents collaboration can produce social values</a>.</strong> The event is run by Ezio Manzini, one of the world\u2019s top-notch designers for social innovation.<strong> You can partner with us</strong> if you want to help make it into a workshop on addressing specific problems tied to reception and inclusion of asylum seekers in some of the cities and towns represented at the conference. Or just sign up and part\n\n2. <strong>We also have a way to produce cheap, accurate ethnographic data around problems like the ones mentioned above, with a focus on surfacing creative and actionable solutions</strong>. This would enable you to engage a large number of participants (thousands) in a participatory process for designing solutions to meet their own needs. This methodology is being employed/supported by a growing number of actors including the current Swedish minister of Nordic cooperation and strategic foresight, the European Commission, the Rockefeller Foundation, the United Nations Development Program and United Nations Volunteers as well as the cities of Milan and Matera in Italy, and of Bucharest in Romania. <strong>We have developed a methodological guide for doing this - </strong><span>email me if you would like a copy: nadia@edgeryders.eu.</span>", "created_at": "2016-01-27 23:40:01", "updated_at": "2017-11-13 21:17:23.530619", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1943, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 40.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2201], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25794, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5688, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>How to formulate a challenge</b>\n\nIn our experience, addressing communities works best when you ask them to share stories: experiential data. Asking for opinions or points of view is a bad idea. You get low quality information: half-baked abstractions, ideology, prejudice... we all are most interesting when we share things we have experienced directly. Experience is\u00a0rich in content and deeply embedded in context. Looking at similar experiences (for example: being hospitalized) from many different points of view drives the \"collective\" in collective intelligence: the different experiences will combine into a community-validated point of view (for example, it becomes easy to recognize a single experience as an outlier if everyone else had a different experience on something).\u00a0\n\nConsider the following question, taken by @Rossana_Torri above:\u00a0\n\nWhat could be the added value of adopting a \u201cmaker/fablab\u201d approach to \u201creframe\u201d care systems pushing this kind of tools/skills/places into \u201ccommunity-driven\u201d care systems?\n\nThis is not the kind of question you can <em>directly</em> ask a community. People will immediately go into\u00a0wishful thinking mode: \"we should..\" (\"bisognerebbe...\") and design irrealistic and broken systems that no one can implement. Individual citizens are not especially\u00a0good at systems design. They are good at data processing.\u00a0I have explained this at length in my book.\u00a0You need to ask indirectly, in a way that encourages them to tap into their experience. The equivalent\u00a0direct question should be something like:\n\nTell us about how you, or people close to you, use a DIY approach to staying healthy or caring for each other.\n\nThis immediately puts the person into a citizen expert mode. They have already attacked a problem. This will be highly specific (\"a visually impaired electronic engineering student\u00a0needed a way to design electrical circuits, so we did XYZ\"). The system level knowledge will be extracted, later, by using ethnography to figure out what concepts, practices, culture etc.\u00a0connect the different stories.\u00a0\n\nWe are ready to assist you writing challenges.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-06-30 10:54:03", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:22.338851", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 365, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [23683], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25294, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2445, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Gotcha</b>\n\nOk, it's decided then.

Also, hierarchies are supported. I went as far as four levels deep, I suspect that there is no limit to how many levels you can add in the hierarchy. I have done the following:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>created a top-level <code class=\"content-output\">spotTheFuture</code> term.</li>\n\n<li>created two children terms, <code class=\"content-output\">actors</code> and <code class=\"content-output\">assets</code>\u00a0as category terms.

This means that the hierarchy of codes does not have to be a tree. For example \"environmental science\" could be a child both of \"environent\" and \"science\". I have tested this on my test tag. THe result looks like this:\u00a0\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/0/0f2965cfcdd84f213d06a49997114074856a0b41.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\">\n\nBad news: the codes for STF do not correspond to the code tree with the hierarchy that we produced in 2014. I think @Inga_Popovaite might have re-built the hierarchy outside OE. I will ask.\u00a0\n\nIn general, however, we will not need to have a hierarchy\u00a0of codes that fans out from the project. There is no need. In fact, the whole idea of OE is that the codes can be shared across projects. When you want to grab a project from the API, you will use the annotations or the contentinstead:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Grab all codes, because you are going to need them.</li>\n\n<li>Grab annotations, but filter out those that have not been made by the ethnographers who are part of your team. You can combine this filtering method by</li>\n\n<li>Grab content. Now, filter out all annotations that refer to content without the scope of your project. For example, the APIs for opencare return only opencare content. OE annotations APIs will return annotations that refer to non-opencare stuff, but you can decide to filter them out.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nBut in general, each ethnographer can\u00a0use other ethnographer's annotations as a guide to finding more material on Edgeryders. For example, suppose I am coding a conversation and\u00a0find people talking about debt. I might want to navigate to the \"debt\" code (taxonomy term) page, from there to annotations that encode \"debt\", and from there to the actial content where\u00a0<em>other</em>\u00a0ethnographers have found people talking about debt. This can be used as \"parallax data\" to give my research more debt.\u00a0\n\nTo enable this, codes should be \"floating around\", detached from specific projects and ethnographer. We will want to write guidelines for this: it's not so much about using a piece of software, it's about turning ethnography into a massively collaborative endeavour.\u00a0\n\nI made this visualization of the data model in OE, that illustrates the roles of codes and annotations.\u00a0\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/c/cbb6b2016ce777f2338ca7a234735e27426c8d2d.jpeg\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\">\n\n", "created_at": "2016-08-05 15:44:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:49.627758", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 640, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7653, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 3752, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>What's a curator got to do?</b>\n\nSorry for the blunt question but I'm not well versed in these conference things :D I assume a curator would prepare and moderate the opening and closing panel discussions, and select sessions that will be part of the curated track?

So no, I'm not going to tell you a shiny social entrepreneur story here. Things are not looking particularly shiny. This is a \"precarious social entrepreneur\" story ...\n\nWell, at least I had a great time at Social Innovation Academy 2013 in Amsterdam. Because of somehow <a href=\"http://socialinnovationcompetition.eu/399/\">reaching semifinals</a> in the <a href=\"http://socialinnovationcompetition.eu/\">European Social Innovation Competition 2013</a>. (See below for some pictures.)\n\nNow here's what it is like to be a precarious social innovator. Working on your innovation needs investment and creativity, and both require a surplus of resources. While precarity is all about lacking that surplus: your \"success\" is little more than bare survival even when you try really hard.\u00a0Precarity is also about uncertainty, while working on an innovation needs a constant supply of work to arrive anywhere. So I discovered that being a precarious social entrepreneur simply does not work out: it's a long story of achieving nothing great. For me personally this means currently that I'd have to work on (1) a <a href=\"http://www.startnext.de/\">crowd investment</a> campaign, (2) applications for other funds and support, incl. the above competition, (3) our core network barter algorithm and more, but instead could do barely more during the last months than keeping myself financially afloat, inspite of minimal running costs.\n\nSo, there's really a place for funding citizen-driven innovation, as done through the European Social Innovation Competition. However, it's done with far too low volume. 60k EUR in prize money for <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/innovation/policy/social-innovation/\">605 entries</a>? C'm on, srsly? And yes, I know there are more funds from other sources, but these are generally inaccessible to citizen entrepreneurs or anybody else not affiliated with an organization of the establishment. Let's take it this way: if you only fund the establishment to do social innovation, you don't let any new players enter this field, and inherently reproduce the division of society into \"established\" and \"precarious\" groups among social innovators themselves. One of the very things that social innovation wants to overcome.\n\nAnd yes, I understand the argument that most of our social innovation ideas are not good enough yet to be funded. This is even true. However: the innovators themselves are there already, and that's the main ingredient. They bring passion, creativity and the willingness to learn. And many citizen social entrepreneurs also identified a problem correctly, as they innovate to solve something that causes their own precarity or exclusion. So, investing some consulting here to help us refine and polish our ideas is something with really promising ROI opportunities (in social terms, of course). Put the other way round, many social innovations from citizens will not become solutions to their problems simply because nobody tells their innovators how to do that ...\n\nSocial Innovation Academy in Amsterdam was a good first take on this, and I commend that the organizers realized how important it is to provide consulting expertise to citizen innovators. However, I also want to propose some changes, because this type of social innovator support was still clinging to establishment's ways of doing stuff. And for that reason, it was inefficient. Only 30 out of 605 teams could receive some social innovation counselling, while the rest (as far as I know) got no feedback for their idea. And for the 30 of us, it was for a good part a \"school type\" experience, though the organizers from NESTA, Kennisland and European Commission tried hard to be personally accessible. Yet still, the program during these two days was either listening to presentations (interesting without a doubt, but there's similar stuff on YouTube) or working with our peers (who lack the same crucial expertise). So what I enjoyed most was a small group session, each group with one of the instructors, where we could get deeper-going feedback on our ideas and their presentation. We need more of this!\n\nSo how about this alternative way to organize social innovation consulting: European Commission opening up a web space that offers a permanent consultation space for social innovation. Or if tied to a competition, for everybody who entered the competition, and as long as it runs. The same thing that <a href=\"http://frag-einen-anwalt.de/\">frag-einen-anwalt.de</a> is in Germany for (paid) legal advice, but here (cost-free) for social innovation and social entrepreneurship. Submit your idea, get detailed feedback. As easy as that. All ideas and answers would be public, and open content, in return for being cost-free. Even better, this Q&amp;A space could be integrated where the buzz is, where grassroots social innovators already gather. (We could easily make room here on edgeryders.eu for that :-) ) What I look for is not feedback for a ninety-second pitch or talking to a subject-matter expert in a five-minute coffee break, but for the very same expert to have 2-4 hours for my idea, to understand it, research a bit, then giving the feedback and allowing me to discuss potential improvements.\n\nWhat the Social Innovation Academy taught me was the value of expertise: there's a lot to learn from funders, innovation policy professionals and serial social entrepreneurs, a lot that you simply can't learn from us peers who are still stumbling in the dark (or alternatively, are just not in the meritocratic position to talk somebody off a bad idea). Economy App itself was born when we got a one-page expert feedback from an (unsuccessful) submission of another idea to a <a href=\"http://www.gruenderwettbewerb.de/\">German business idea competition</a>. They basically told us, the compensation scheme in our proposed small business support network was too risky and legally too complex for contributors. In the following half an hour, we developed the way more ingenious network barter algorithm that is at the core of Economy App. But we could not have given that feedback to ourselves, we needed an expert.\n\nThese experts seem to hide in all kinds of think tanks and other established structures. It's a question of accessibility that, when addressed, empowers the social innovator citizen more than a cash prize.\n\n<hr>\n\n<strong>Image credits:</strong> Photos were taken by <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=157289349\">Muryani Kasdani</a> and kindly provided under <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/deed.en\">CC-BY-SA 2.0 licence</a> within a <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/kl/sets/72157632995905648/with/8556555267/\">set of 40 images on flickr.com</a>.

These three senses of culture are actually quite different, and, Williams writes, they compete with one another. Each time we use the word 'culture,' we incline toward one or another of its aspects: toward the \u201cculture\u201d that\u2019s imbibed through osmosis or the 'culture' that\u2019s learned at museums, toward the 'culture' that makes you a better a person or the 'culture' that just inducts you into a group.')\"</em>\n\nMaybe you mean \"culture\" here as a sum total of what a society does outside of structures such as government and organized religion.\u00a0 Rather similar to \"zeitgeist\" or \"Spirit of the times.\"\u00a0 That suggests something like the Occupy Movement was cultural in this context.\u00a0\n\nAlso, the acceptance and legalization of gay marriage in the USA shows how the people lead and the government follows.\u00a0 This example corresponds pretty well to your chart showing acceptance.\u00a0 One lesson from that is broad government acceptance and change in legal status started locally in a few areas with high concentrations of people for whom this change was already their way of life. \u00a0 All faced great criticism from outside for taking the step, such as the Mayor of San Francisco when he was the first public official to sanction gay marriage.\u00a0 Regardless and perhaps in spite of it, this lead to others demanding it, and other local and state governments followed.\u00a0 National figures shied away from it until a certain tide turned.\u00a0 Then it became the law of the land.\n\nYour comments about the challenges of stewardship point to a central problem of sustaining change.\u00a0 If it all relies on government and legal structures then you can see a situation such as where, despite the constitutional declaration of racial equality in the USA, local culture takes things the other way: some states use their local laws and authority to perpetrate inequality.\u00a0 In other words, even if you get to where you change the highest laws of the land, without something to sustain the spirit and values that created the change, it can go backwards if it is just left to government and other high authority if those offices are held (and financed) by regressive people.\n\nHow to create beneficial change in a matrix of violence such as we see today.\u00a0 Most people do not want this violent matrix.\u00a0 We don't need a poll for that.\u00a0 How many people have fled Syria compared to how many are fighting?\u00a0 How many Christians, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, etc etc want peace compared to how many seek war?\u00a0 And yet, the guns hold so much sway.\n\nBack in the 70s I was part of two social projects that gave direct help to people in need.\u00a0 In the South Bronx in NYC we created and operated a free ambulance service that caused the City of New York to improve its own service to those people.\u00a0 In Guatemala we brought piped water to villages where they no longer had to carry it in jugs, and showed them how to sustain their nutrition by growing and using soybeans.\u00a0 But in both cases, we peace-loving folks had to walk away from those projects when the violence got to the point that we seemed likely to get shot ourselves.\u00a0 In the Bronx it was from drive-by shootings because crack and automatic weapons became commonplace.\u00a0 In Guatemala it was from the government goon squads.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhat is the link between \"terrorism\" and \"authoritarianism\"?\u00a0 Are they always related?\u00a0 Some acts of terror are suicide missions directed by a more central authority, and some are the acts of crazy loners (such as we see in all these mass shootings in America), but in any case, these days acts of terrorism cause increases in authoritarianism to the point that we see the opposite of what happens with social chances like gay marriage.\u00a0 In these cases the governments take over and the people either follow or become outliers (such as those of us who protested the start of the Gulf War).\n\nIs the goal with this thread to figure out how to grow pockets of culture where the things that lead to terrorism (and authoritarianism) cannot thrive?\n\n", "created_at": "2015-12-03 05:56:46", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:27.262618", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 931, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13002, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 1736, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Yayy, so looking forward to it!</b>\n\nSee you in Berlin!!\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-23 13:27:59", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:13.677633", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 14, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21804, "user_id": 2333, "topic_id": 3627, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Great!</b>\n\nPerfect @Alberto!

Unless there is space for design (often missing in open source dynamics) then a story is never quite told ... even though one seems to be there just around the corner. Instead there are many paragraphs. sentences, pages ... even occasionally beautiful phrases ... but never a good story.\n\nThere is a story to be told around the user-profile and it may ripple out into the entire EdgeRyders website.

How do we create the conditions for\u00a0#opencare in our organisations and our communities? How do we design communities and organisations that are care-full, and promote health and flourishing? I'm curious about the interplay between policy and culture (as in ways of doing things rather than music and art). Are policies simply\u00a0agreements about what we think works and what is right at any given time? Moreover how are they implemented at government or\u00a0regional levels and in organisations, if they are to be more than good intentions? Do they end up needing enforced or policed by someone? Are they a tool of old ways of doing things built on hierarchy and power over? What role can they play in\u00a0creating the conditions for\u00a0opencare or for that matter for love and acceptance and generating\u00a0the sense of coherence that Antonovsky describes in <b>salutogenesis</b>\u00a0and its approach to study what creates health and well being rather than researching dis-ease?\n\nMy work through the GalGael Trust based in the Govan area of Glasgow has offered some hints that actively generating\u00a0a healthy\u00a0culture is perhaps more effective in achieving in an anchored way the 'good intentions' of policy. Strong values guide actions, decisions and\u00a0behaviour, influence language and how we treat one another. Our workshop sees people working, for the most, part side by side. We\u2019ve had people with violent histories, people who suffer agoraphobia, depression and addiction. Yet something about the space we\u2019ve created has meant that people largely get on, there\u2019ve been no violent incidents in our 20 year history and people describe their doctor taking them off medication, sometimes for the first time in many\u00a0years.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s not a silver bullet. People lapse. They fall back in to the darkness at times. But there is something undeniable about the environment we\u2019ve created and actively generate that has a therapeutic affect. While some of our participants and volunteers have said \u2018the work is the therapy\u2019 - this refers to the hands on purpose they find in their labours not the work we do with them. So is this as a result of policy or culture? What is it that creates the conditions for an environment of open care? How do we understand the architectures of love that are called for to create a more care-full society?\n\nWe\u2019ve recently spent a year curating a collaborative process to explore what it means to \u2018be GalGael\u2019. It saw us going back to our beginnings and drawing on the learning from our days as an anti-motorway protest camp. We wrestled with our assumptions - which were shared and which were disputed?\u00a0We explored whether our purpose was actually underneath it all - to bring about greater love. This contributes to our being in a good place to\u00a0explore this theme more widely in our own organisation\u00a0and its practical application in more depth.\n\nThrough the process we would like to connect and learn from other organisations exploring this theme.\u00a0\n\nWhat kind of structures and processes are essential building blocks or make up the \u2019hardware\u2019?\n\nWhat kind internal capacities and approaches make up the \u2018software\u2019 that keep a healthy organisation, healthy community or healthy societies humming with human flourishing?\n\nThe theme could also link to other themes that explore how we create the conditions such as:\n\n- citizens income and the politics of time;\n\n- nature of collaboration and how we exercise our freedoms and capacities;\n\n- the nature of work in care-full societies;\n\n- forms of leadership and personal capacity called for.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m very new to Edgeryders and I\u2019ve not had much time to develop this so would appreciate feedback and thoughts as to whether this might be a theme of interest to others. \u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-06 19:08:27", "updated_at": "2017-09-19 14:15:53.824190", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 691, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 27.6, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 4, 854, 3433, 200], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28103, "user_id": 166, "topic_id": 3037, "post_number": 10, "raw": "Cool!

Basically looking at the network around - and especially between - our three nodes. I have not gotten around to researching his \"internet footprints\" in more detail though. I assume there won't be much to find apart from publications and perhaps some research projects he may have been involved in. If we find those it could tell us a lot about his interests (and where his financial sources are). For example he was the lead author on this article two years ago http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885912001072 (<a data-clk=\"hl=en&amp;sa=T&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=0&amp;ei=s9V2VZP1H4jO0wGjwYGoBg\" href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885912001072\">Analysis of thirty years evolution of urban growth, transport demand and supply, energy consumption, greenhouse and pollutants emissions in Greater Cairo</a>).

I think I told you I had a (Vienna) city planner contact with and empirical \"cycling transport science PhD project\" wife. So that may be a pretty good fit. Unfortunately I don't have here direct contact details yet - but I will try to fix that soon (probably this week). In the meantime one could assume she is in this network: http://www.ecf.com/projects/scientists-for-cycling/ and look if there is a corner of the network that is particularly interesting for Cairo (google scholar is helpful here). E.g. an experiment that went relatively well in principle but they need to collect more data (e.g. including non-Central-European cities). One could then ask if you could piggyback onto the ongoing effort and perhaps re-use their hardware locally to produce more data for them in return for some reasonable financial compensation/a collaborative proposal for funding lead by them further down the road.\n\nBasically the third step would be actively hunting for \"the missing puzzle piece\" to complete a team that could e.g. write a proposal for funding of a project (or similar), or just wait until the puzzle piece arrives by itself.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-09 12:22:06", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:52.698628", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 470, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [31262], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29101, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 3047, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>Summary of the Session</b>\n\n\u00a0\n\nGeorgia a very low level of charity and philanthropy. This has mainly to do with low levels of trust in NGOs and charities. Highest levels of trust in Georgia are in the church. They receive large amounts of donations, however, have a lack in transparency, no-one really knows where the money is going and what the overhead is.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHow can we change this mentality, the perception of the Georgian population towards giving to charity other than the church?\n\n\u00a0\n\nWeHelp.ge is a crowdsourcing platform where people in medical need can receive donations. They have created a transparent open system, which eliminates any reason for distrust:\n\n\u00a0\n\n<em>You can transfer money: through the electronic banking, by the electronic cards. Also via phone calls (1 call- 1 GEL). You can donate by PayBox machines as well. WeHelp does not generate any profit from the money transferred. Full amount of money is spent on the beneficiary, selected by the users. The amount transferred by you, is directly reflected on the beneficiary's page and on the web-site as well. The user has the possibility to transfer money for the fund's existence and support. Existence of the fund totally depends on users and partners. We do not take any % from the money transferred for beneficiaries. The users of Wehelp are provided with an opportunity to see beneficiaries' health-related documents and to ensure the accuracy of the information. People need to know, why they are helping patients and make sure, that the information provided meets reality.</em>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>Their mission is\u00a0to save the lives of peoples and connect beneficiaries with a large crowd; to connect the people in need, with the people who want to give. Boris <em>\"I was raised that if you give to charity, that money needs to go directly to the person in need, not the organization. So that idea we have implemented at wehelp. We dont take any overhead.</em></span><em><span>\"</span></em>\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere are video's, pictures and personal stories. You can choose who you want to donate to and you will see right away this in the bar of money that person needs.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey use different kinds of tools for donating: creditcard, payboxes, mobile payments. The problem with mobile payments is that they take about 25%, which is too much. Dion proposes to embarrase them, they are steeling from people in need. Maybe Jumpstart could make a nice graph about it.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey've already raised 11.000 dollars without any marketing. Boris started everything himself, without donors. \"<em>I did not want to be tainted. I don't get any salary from it</em>.\" says Boris. They marketed wehelp solely through facebook and gained a lot of attention. However, there s a PR plan in place to make it even broader.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey've also partnered up with several companies to support them. For example, the Radisson, with whom they made a strategy where their employees can choose to donate 5 gel a month from their salary to wehelp, 50% agreed. Very important: different companies have different approaches.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nPerhaps more attention should eb brought to corporate social responsibility, however, in other countries the CSR department is often more cosmetics than actually doing any work.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>Boris: \"</span><em style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 19.200000762939453px;\">For me the most important part is the amount of people we have saved thus far</em><span>.\"\u00a0</span>\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-06-25 09:20:22", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:40.081345", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 879, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32545, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1276, "post_number": 31, "raw": "<b>Une exp\u00e9rience diff\u00e9rente d'une personne \u00e0 l'autre</b>\n\nUn beau texte, \u00c9veil et prisme de conscience.\n\nChaque personne \u00e9tant unique, l'\u00e9veil ne se passe pas de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re pour tout le monde.

She hasn't considered the web as a place to buy jewellery but thinks it works - she thought people needed to touch and wear jewellery before spending - but that's referring to expensive jewellery, which is what she learned to do - now she is switching to more affordable pieces.\n\nThe website isn't an online shop, at the moment it's only possible to order or contact by email, so it's more of an online portfolio. She hasn't connected the two worlds so far: Susanne uses internet but hasn't sold via it although it seems to work on platforms such as <a href=\"http://www.etsy.com/\">etsy</a> and is now looking at <a href=\"http://monoqi.com/\">http://monoqi.com</a> which does auctions of pieces by designers, which she considers to be \"a nice approach as people like stuff which has been pre-selected\u2026\u00a0 and they start to research you if they like you.\"\n\nHer diploma is in collaborative product design and she has studied mass customisation &amp; open source. The question, she feels, is how to remain designers but share knowledge and designs? Uploading designs to be remixed is a strong opportunity and is the idea behind an event she is planning with <a href=\"http://cookiesncode.com/\">Cookies'n'Code</a>, called <a href=\"http://cookiesncode.com/cyofuture/\">Create Your Own Future</a> which wants to \"bring together people from all kinds of backgrounds\u2026 to share skills, knowledge, ideas and needs and try to think about solutions and approaches of how we can live differently in the future and of how we can have more of this collaborative thought instead of competition.\"\n\nI asked her about an event in Berlin called <a href=\"http://makerplatz.makerlab.info/?page_id=597\">makerplatz</a> and she explained that the idea was that people could come and build their own things in a day with people who have planned &amp; prepared it, so they get guidance through the process but they put things together themselves. It's not something everybody wants to do everyday with all things but it's a growing desire, to have another relationship with the objects they are surrounded by, in her opinion.\n\nCreate Your Own Future will be an ongoing thing - so many things happen on the web and people don't really meet in the physical world so the idea is to bring them, with their ideas, to one place in the physical world so they can start to work and build and create things and from that, to build a community and a platform that can be working on the internet but new gatherings can be organised.\n\nMaking your own unique pieces is nice, Susanne feels, but she doesn't need to do it and is much more interested in enabling people to discover their own creativity and possibilities, getting away from the \"I can't do this\" and \"I'm no good at this\" into \"let's try it because it's fun!\" She continues, \"we can build everything by ourselves and everyone can learn basically anything, probably not rocket science or medicine, within in a day but there are a lot of things that, if there's the proper guidance and it's prepared, people can really have a lot of fun and learn something and feel proud of themselves - the future role of a designer will shift from the taste giving specialist for an object, to much more design a process in which things can happen.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\n(Full disclosure: Cookies'n'Code is a loose network of creative people in which I am now collaborating)\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-16 19:53:11", "updated_at": "2017-08-27 06:19:38.162848", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 836, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10094, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 3966, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Aw.

Many writers and thinkers have deplored this for decades but still nothing has changed. The situation has become worse and worse. Particularly, the ideal of education as an end in itself, as a virtuous improvement of the intellect and the soul, has been entirely lost in a language of \"preparing young people for the workplace\". And of course as we now see there is little or no workplace to \"enter\". At the World Economic Forum in Davos, it was clear that if the problem of large scale unemployment is recognised, the solutions proposed are entirely conventional - making the labour market more flexible (i.e. reduce worker protection), reduce holidays, increase part-time work etc. resulting in an overall \"cheaper\" labour <a class=\"reference external\" data-mce-=\"\" href=\"https://infocus.credit-suisse.com/app/article/index.cfm?fuseaction=OpenArticle&amp;amp;aoid=381190&amp;amp;refresh=true&amp;amp;lang=EN\">force</a>.\n\nEdgeryders is another example in many ways. The notion of a precariat, of people whose income and work is precarious, is defined in contrast to the \"un-precariate\" in other words people who have regular employment. We still seem unable to break away from a definition of human existence and value determine by the concept of work, its value and importance. @dougald in his recent outstanding <a class=\"reference external\" data-mce-=\"\" href=\"/blog/the-regeneration-of-meaning\">piece</a> noted three key issues - how to pay the rent, who one is in the eyes of others, and why one gets out of bed in the morning.\n\nI would like in the following text to take these issues briefly apart by posing the question as to whether we are being sufficiently radical, sufficiently outrageous in our conceptualisations of alternatives.\n\n<h3>Paying the rent</h3>\n\nFirst of all we need to ask why we are paying a rent at all. This immediately leads to questions of property, ownership, and the uneven distribution of wealth in society, not to mention the lack of social housing - or the provision of housing by not-for-profit actors. The total stock of houses in Europe which are empty or unused is extraordinarily high - over 600,000 <a class=\"reference external\" data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/houseprices/8969627/Number-of-empty-houses-rises-by-12000.html\">houses</a> in the UK, over one third of homes in <a class=\"reference external\" data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http://www2.rgu.ac.uk/publicpolicy/introduction/housing.htm\">Greece</a> are empty. Of course this is a classic problem of economic distribution - where the houses are relative to jobs, who owns them etc. We need to question the fundamentals of a world where people need an education, in order to get a job, in order to feed and house themselves. And if any part of this chain fails, people who are not protected by their families or who do not show immense creativity and initiative find themselves on the <a class=\"reference external\" data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http://www.homelessworldcup.org/content/homelessness-statistics\">street</a> . While there are interesting initiatives which create non-monetary opportunities for temporary housing (hospitality exchange), solutions which address the long term housing issue outside the conventional economy are not yet visible.\n\nWhy not? Probably because we find it very hard to think in terms which do not involve property and ownership and the corresponding security which it apparently provides. Stepping outside that paradigm will mean for many the abandonment of a dream which has become normalised in many parts of Europe <a class=\"footnote-reference\" data-mce-=\"\" href=\"/wp-admin/post.php?post=3946&amp;action=edit#id3\" id=\"id1\">[1]</a>.\n\n<h3>The eyes of others</h3>\n\nThere is an inverse relationship in our society with regard to your income and how useful your role is for the human care of others (and of the environment). Mothers looking after children never get paid and such a suggestion would seem absurd to most people. And yet it is the most fundamental activity for the continuing survival of our species. Most people who are in caring professions (nurses, social workers) are paid very much at the lower end of the social scale. There a particular category for which we have no name who are people who act as unpaid therapists/spiritual advisors/counsellors - often these are people who are unable to hold down conventional jobs. This category may include some priests and minor gurus. All these people in modern contemporary society are neither appreciated nor recognised as offering essential services to society. There are certain limited arenas where people can be active in an unpaid manner and this may lead to peer group recognition. The FOSS world is one such example. But even here, this is often valued because of the eventual opportunity this will lead to obtain a \"conventional\" job. The definition of value in the eyes of others is almost entirely mediated by the job one holds and nothing is changing that fundamentally.\n\nSo -- you need an education, in order to get a job, and then be able to feed yourself, house yourself, and have value in the eyes of others. This chain needs to be rethought radically and at a minimum reversed but better still entirely alternative categories need to be envisioned.\n\n<h3>Getting out of bed</h3>\n\nThere are lots of reasons we get out of bed in the morning - habit, necessity (need for food), passion and ambition are just some. But just as we have argued that there is a misallocation in our society of wealth and correspondingly housing and food, and similarly a misallocation of reputation and recognition, so I would argue there is a misallocation of meaning. Work and success with work is consistently taken as providing meaning; or worse still the act of consumption. We have been trained in our society to identify meaning with the acquisition of objects whether the right car, the latest style of handbag or the most fashionable pair of trainers. We must not forget that this is still the vector for access to meaning for a vast proportion of the population.\n\nBoth psychological studies and centuries of spiritual teachings have tried again and again to persuade us that real meaning lies in what is least regarded today. These include caring for others, both loved ones and those less fortunate than ourselves, paying attention to the small acts and rituals of daily life, preparing and sharing a meal with friends. What is interesting is the consistency in the message from all the different spiritual traditions and equally the self-help books.\n\nThe misallocation of meaning is profound in its impacts and in providing a driving force to many of the problematic activities and behaviours around us. It would be absurd or presumptuous to ask for a different view on the allocation of meaning. There are plenty enough available. What is needed perhaps is mechanisms for the greater adoption and spread of such meaning allocations. Currently we are failing collectively in this area, and this is largely due to the over dominance of \"paying the rent\" and the \"the eyes of others\" as criteria in people's lives. Understandably so.\n\n<h3>The role of the State</h3>\n\nWe seem to be forgetting somewhere in our eagerness to identify and develop parallel institutions/networks/initiations, that the state still exists, and it is unlikely to go away anytime soon. The state has coercive force and impacts on our lives in multiple ways both constructively and destructively. Currently there is no way to develop an entirely parallel system outside of the fundamental provisions of the state. The state provides an officially recognised medium of exchange in money, it provides food and housing by means of its guarantee to property holders of some form of security. The state provides a minimum of physical security. As many of us are aware, it has been an ideological choice of the last 30 years or so, in many European countries, to redistribute wealth upwards to the elite with a consequent reduction in disposable wealth and consumption for the wider population. This is intimately connected, of course, with the current absence of economic activity.\n\nWe need to remember that overall we are not starving in Europe <a class=\"footnote-reference\" data-mce-=\"\" href=\"/wp-admin/post.php?post=3946&amp;action=edit#id4\" id=\"id2\">[2]</a>, unlike many regions in Africa or Asia. We have a tendency in these discussions to conflate the long term trends towards collapse in western society (resource depletion, excessive complexity, lack of leadership, etc.) with the current highly artificial situation which is solvable by the state. There is no real lack of money, neither in the Eurozone or Sterling area, so all the social consequences of austerity are political <a class=\"reference external\" data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/\">choices</a> .\n\nThere is some recognition by the elite that the precariat presents a danger to the social order. Concern has been expressed about the levels of youth <a class=\"reference external\" data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-21180371\">unemployment</a> in some European countries. There is disagreement how big a danger this represents and whether it has reached critical mass. Academic research points to increased social unrest when governments impose <a class=\"reference external\" data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1899287\">austerity</a> . There are parallels with other revolutions and I suppose one should ask what the tipping point is. But even if we do reach a tipping point with major social disorders, the question will remain whether the resulting developments will substantive or merely superficial. How much change did the 1968 unrests or the Arab Spring really produce from the perspective of the everyday citizen rather than the intellectual elite?\n\nEuropean states and their economies could pursue expansionary fiscal policies targeted at reducing social injustice and creating employment for young people. What is fascinating is that there is no indication of any such move across Europe at present, <em>and</em> that Edgeryders is in complete agreement in not expecting let alone demanding action on the part of the state. In this regard, Edgryders is subscribing to the dominant ideological paradigm. If we look at the \"alternative\" structures proposed or referred to, none of them are large scale response that can touch that 50% youth unemployment. This does not reduce the importance of these ideas because somewhere, hidden amongst the suggestions, there will be something that will have a lasting impact. All I am suggesting is that at present there is insufficient radical innovation or creativity.\n\nMuch more interesting, in my view, are ways to find leverage on the state. It has been stated or implied that neo-liberalism and especially the Chicago School had a long term view, in training people ready to step in when crises hit and offer to provide remedies which would fundamentally change the social and economic order. How could Edgeryders and the people associated with it provide a long term body of expertise and radical thinking which could \"step-in\" at an appropriate moment to change the social and economic order? How can the appropriate levers be put in place to make that possible. The design of relevant levers is essential.\n\n<dl class=\"docutils\">\n\n<dt>I have covered too much ground probably far too briefly here. In essence, I wish to suggest that:</dt>\n\n<dd>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>innovation needs to come in understanding our subservience to existing paradigms/definitions of \"work\" and \"meaning\". The very notion of the precariat is subscribing to the existent dominant paradigm concerning the value of work and its nature.</li>\n\n<li>innovation needs to provide newer or better forms of leverage to change the dominant ideology into one that redistribute resources more efficiently (food, housing, \"meaning\"). It is not sufficient to provide intellectual alternatives if they are only going impact a very small number of people. We need to find ways to leverage the state to actually make socially just choices and use its (essentially limitless) resources to that end. This sounds terribly boring as in we need political engagement to change the dominant paradigm, but I see little alternative.</li>\n\n<li>perfection cannot be achieved, but we can much better than we are doing now.</li>\n\n<li>some of this change may concurrently help us prepare for the longer term dangers of environmentally imposed societal collapse - next year.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n</dd>\n\n</dl>\n\n<table class=\"docutils footnote mceItemTable\" id=\"id3\" rules=\"none\">\n\n<colgroup>\n\n<col class=\"label\">\n\n<col>\n\n</colgroup>\n\n<tbody valign=\"top\">\n\n<tr>\n\n<td class=\"label\"><a class=\"fn-backref\" data-mce-=\"\" href=\"/wp-admin/post.php?post=3946&amp;action=edit#id1\">[1]</a></td>\n\n<td>Not all.

Without practice, no theorizing about it.\n\nThen, I can see the aesthetic, artistic and practical value of the book you propose. Yes, it would gather its following, and there would be people who read a \"narrative instruction manual\" end to end. But how many? It's not everybody's style, esp. on the Net where content gets ever shorter and more focused. (And that's not necessarily bad. It's different: the web as an answer machine makes this kind of content meaningful. People would be embarrassed to know how little I know about Drupal and how much I look up just-in-time in stackoverlow.com's 4 million pre-solved problems :D.) Although creating a book is an achievement to be proud of, if we can have more impact with another format, why would we go for a book format, that potentially only a few people really consume? (\"Nobody tells us to produce long (policy) documents any more, so why should we?\").\n\nAlso, the theory in such a book is not everybody's view of things. By adding a theory layer, you add potential for disagreement, while on the level of details there will be a lot of agreement. For example, I'd potenially agree with Christopher on practical questions of squatting. But not on the meta level, where he proposes to develop a framework for leveraging the state, and I propose one (EarthOS) for replacing the state with decentralized solutions.\n\nOf course I see a place for political theory and a framework \u2013 it' spart of becoming true citizen experts. Just that, as in economics, there will always be different schools of thought in politics and sociology, and I propose to acknowledge that Edgeryders will always contain experts of many such schools of thought.\n\nHere's where I see the value of reuse coming in: If the chunks of detail content we produce are open content and prepared to be reused, we can just do so. You might write a narrative-style cookbook for social change on big and small levels. I might be happy with hands-on topical collections of Q&amp;A type instructions, or maybe summarize them into a hands-on booklet like <a href=\"https://techtoolsforactivism.org/booklet\">Tech Tools for Activism</a>.\n\nI acknowledge however that nodbody can be sure to have the best theory and best approach for impact. We're all trying. But trying multiple approaches in parallel is a strength even, as can be seen in the free software movement. So I propose we all (as potential content producers for this kinda project) should find a way to produce reusable chunks of content, and then reuse them as we see fit. A <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/\">Stackoverflow</a> type of site would be a suggestion. And I can well imagine institutional and governmental actors to be there as well, for example answering questions about social innovation <a href=\"/economy-app/precarious-entrepreneurs\">as I propose here</a> or about EU funding (thinking of our very valuable discussion session with Prabhat Agarwal in the EU parliament). Collaboratively authoring a complete book produces however hardly reusable content, as book content with interwoven theory is not modular enough for that.\n\n(Side note: from all the 101 StackExchange sites, there is only <a href=\"http://sustainability.stackexchange.com\">sustainability.stackexchange.com</a> with an at least somwhat similar focus to what I propose. But maybe somebody found something closer elsewhere?)\n\n", "created_at": "2013-04-17 12:52:40", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:20.374445", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 616, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [24991], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16462, "user_id": 157, "topic_id": 2114, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>The show must go on</b>\n\nanother \"stone\" was placed at the base of the building unmonastery. \\#unmonastery, together, we will use as a valuable resource to innovate the territory", "created_at": "2013-11-02 17:48:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:32.248492", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 31, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [81], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25912, "user_id": 3580, "topic_id": 6201, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>@Guido</b>\n\nHi Guido, can you join us at the next meeting?

Are you with us? We\u2019re already staffing up!\n\n<strong><span>1: What\u2019s wrong with Capital?</span></strong>\n\nThe hardest part of doing things that have never been done before is finding the money. Ideas are, basically, cheap. There\u2019s seven billion of us, two billion or so online, and with that many brains, seeing the \u201cadjacent possible\u201d \u2013 something doable, something close to where we are, but the next evolutionary forwards step \u2013 is as much a question of luck as talent; we\u2019re in a position where the first step in innovation, the idea, is cheap. Our ability to imagine, to know, to mingle and network with people that provide us with the requisite diversity our minds require to have new ideas has far, far outstripped our ability to build things. We\u2019ve got more possible forwards steps than we can take.\n\nThis is a problem because our societies are wedging themselves up shit creek without a paddle, as Americans would say. They\u2019re gutting their welfare states and social programs, deporting immigrants, talking about splitting up Europe and worse, wasting half of an entire generation\u2019s talent in 40% youth unemployment areas. I\u2019m 40, and I have absolutely no idea what I would do if I was 20 today. My generation, comparatively speaking, had it easy \u2013 paid to go to university, and 1989-2001 as more than a decade of stable(ish) peace(ish.) I\u2019m not saying those were\u00a0<strong>better</strong>\u00a0times (less internet!) but they were\u00a0<strong>easier</strong>\u00a0times in the hard-cash roof-over-head sense.\n\nA lot of this catastrophic change in our societies has been driven by\u00a0<strong>abusive capital</strong>. Governments have gotten cornered by enormous banks who, when their gambling at the International House of Dodgy Financial Instruments finally hit \u201c00\u2033 and everything went back to the House, came back to the Government and said \u201cIf we go bankrupt, which by law we should, it\u2019s going to eat your economic prosperity for a generation. Pay our debts!\u201d What we have is a protection racket, where Capital has convinced Government that it needs to be taken care of more than People. As a result, our societies are leaving more and more of us high and dry. I\u2019m 40, at an age when one starts to wonder about things like retirement, and I\u2019m not at all convinced that there\u2019s any store of wealth other than relationships and creation which has any chance of surviving this transformation in our societies.\n\nCapital, as it has been manifested so far, is poisonous.\n\n<strong><span>2: What\u2019s wrong with Society?</span></strong>\n\n<span><span><span>We are faced with two great challenges globally: poverty, and ecology. Poverty is si<span>mple: 7 billion people, 4 billion tooth-brushes, 2 billion flush toi<span>lets. One billion fat people, one billion people who are regular<span>ly hungry, both sides deprived of something they need to be healthy \u2013 exercise and meaning on one side, simple raw calories on the other. The world is a mess.</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n\n<span>Ecology is equally pressing, but more subtle. Huge loss of forests and<span>sea life, climate destabilization \u2013 freak weather flooding cities, 28 years of \u201ca<span>bove average\u201d temperatures,\u00a0</span></span></span>\u00a0and good-times government subsidies for protecting the future which, as the banks imploded, were withdrawn to nurture\u00a0<span>C</span>apital at the expense of the Planet. Yo<span>u could not do a worse job of m<span>anaging\u00a0<span>a civilization w<span>ithout resorting to fascists or lat<span>e Roman\u00a0</span>emperors<span>: Go<span>lden Dawn and Berlusconi.</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n\n<span>But to change things means taking risks. New ideas, by virtue of being new, are untested<span><span>u<span>nknowns. Innovation means failure,\u00a0<span>and recovering from failure means hav<span>ing somet<span>hing in reserve:\u00a0<span>C</span>apital. You don\u2019t (usually<span>) finance the company with the money you needed to pay rent, beca<span>use if return is not immediate\u00a0<span>and large, you\u2019re homeless.<span>\u00a0Just when your society needs innovation most, to face adversity, Capital dries up, and you\u2019re left\u00a0<span>the same behaviors that caused the problem, endlessly repeated because nobody will finance new thinking about the core issues. We get stuck.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>\n\n<span>We thin<span>k we have a solution<span>.</span></span></span>\n\n<strong><span>3: A Plan: what can ordinary-extraordinary people do?</span></strong>\n\n<span><span>The brutual truth is that the crisis deprives\u00a0<span>us of\u00a0<span>access to\u00a0<span>Capital, without which we cannot innovate<span>, b<span>ec<span>ause if the innovation does not immediately succeed, we\u2019re homeless. A large scale culture of innovation requires\u00a0<span>a large scale culture of investment, and the money p<span>oured out of Education and Health into the banks is not returning to us<span>in the form of access to investment.\u00a0<span>Our cultures\u00a0<span>are\u00a0<span>stuck.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>\n\n<span>To get out of this cycle of decline, we need access to \u201c<span>C</span>ountercyclical<span>C</span>apital\u201d -\u00a0</span>something which gets\u00a0<span>more available as economic conditions get worse. Fortunately, this kind of\u00a0<span>Capital exists \u2013 it<span>\u2018s called Human Capita<span>l. It\u2019s talented peo<span>ple without jobs, without incomes, without\u00a0<span>full<span>y-utilized talents. As the economy\u00a0<span>ceases to provide work or affordable education, people become id<span>le, and that\u2019s our reserve of Co<span>untercyclical Capital. We buck the trend<span>!</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>\n\n<span>Our job, therefore, is to\u00a0<span>organize this Cou<span>ntercyclical\u00a0<span>Capital \u2013 that\u2019s us, we\u00a0<span>under-financed masses, yearning to create \u2013 into a form which permits Countercyclical Investment. We form a social organization, like a labour uni<span>on, which permits\u00a0<span>us to Collectivize our strengths, in a form which lets\u00a0<span>us change the way the world works for us and others. This improv<span>es our negotiating position, by making Talent powerful without access\u00a0<span>to (financial) Capital, and it might allow us to provide th<span>e much-needed innovation to help our societies out of their stuckness.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>\n\n<span>It really is possible. There are example<span>s<span>.</span></span></span>\n\n<strong><span>4: Stepping out of the usual frame</span></strong>\n\n<span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Wikipe<span>dia\u2019s a very, very good\u00a0<span>example of the combined pow<span>er of<span>H</span>uman\u00a0<span>C</span>apital to change the worl<span>d.<span>\u00a0We all use it every day,\u00a0<span>and it\u2019s taking effective action on both poverty (poor people ar<span>e usi<span>ng it too, all over the w<span>orld!) and ecology (it\u2019s saving huge\u00a0<span>numbers of trees on paper books.)

It shows what can be done.</span>\n\n<span>But wha<span>t we want is sustainable\u00a0<span>livelihoods</span>. While\u00a0<span>Wikipedia is great, sitting around all day and contributing to it is not going to put food on the table or buy Mom\u2019s birthday presents. What we need is to use a similar ki<span>nd of effect \u2013 a lot of volunteer labor, and a little fin<span>ancial capital \u2013 to solve the employment problem for all of us.</span></span></span></span></span>\n\n<span>In th<span>e\u00a0<span>process, we should have impact on the innovation gap that is threatening all of our futures, and\u00a0<span>thereby poverty and the ecological crisis too. It\u2019s a tall order, but this is an age of miracles.\u00a0</span></span></span></span>\n\n<strong><span>5: Building it</span></strong>\n\nHere\u2019s the idea: a volunteer driven \u201cVenture Social Capital\u201d fund.\n\nWe all put in some time, energy and effort \u2013 we pre-commit resources \u2013 promising time and energy to that fund. A Board of Evaluators does what Venture Capitalists usually do \u2013 they evaluate projects, and give Capital \u2013 in this case, Human Capital or Social Capital \u2013 to get these projects off the ground.\n\nA funded project can then take their grant \u2013 of your and my time and resources \u2013 and ask for help. You come to me, and say \u201cI\u2019ve got an EdgeRyders grant for 40 hours of time and I was wondering if you could write something for me,\u00a0Vinay?\u201d and I say \u201cwell, I\u2019ve got 6 hours on balance here, so yes, what do you need done?\u201d\n\nWhen I\u2019ve done all the hours I\u2019ve promised to the EdgeRyders organization on one project or another, I\u2019m done. I\u2019ve paid my \u201cmembership dues\u201d (like a union!) but, of course, if I feel like doing more voluntarily, I can. It\u2019s that simple. But imagine how it could change life for innovators trying to get great new ideas off the ground if they could get 50 or 100 hours of free, skilled help at the most critical stages of their projects, helping lift the projects off the ground and creating sustainable employment for their founders, and more.\n\nWe\u2019re asking you for one day a year: 10 hours. We think we can get close to 1000 people to volunteer one day a year from the existing EdgeRyders network, and we hope the idea will go viral and become a common social form. If we all give a day a year, perhaps we can finance some of the innovation that neither the Banks or the State can manage, and turn some of this mess around.\n\nI\u2019m in. I\u2019ve given my day. Who needs me? What do you need me to do?\n\n<a href=\"/t/social-capital-for-social-ventures/314\">Sign up for the Edgeryders \u201cVenture Social Capital\u201d Fund here</a>\n\n", "created_at": "2013-04-19 07:50:35", "updated_at": "2017-10-02 08:44:44.325193", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2075, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 6.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1877], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6147, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 6114, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Working on financial reporting now.

please request more clarity if more clarity is desirable.\n\n------\n\nOne of the four initial legs at ER\u2019s inaugural Strasbourg LOTE#1 was 'participatory democratic strategies'.\u00a0 From several sources we heard of citizen initiatives that formed an undeniable additional voice in their local communities.\u00a0 These incorporated net plebiscite solutions, participatory budgeting tools, and software for facilitating broad community policy design meetings.\u00a0\n\nI think this thread remains a central approach behind all ER aspirations.\u00a0 Long-term, I view this work as the central tool that can allow our initiatives to expand exponentially into broad people\u2019s movements.\n\nNow lodged deep within the daily life of the unMo, I suspect this is our ultimate strategy -- to expand the space within the unMo walls for citizen\u2019s organisations to inhabit as \u2018sanctified free space\u2019.\u00a0 That we seek to host human gatherings which supported by our skills promote the strengthening of internal mechanisms of citizen\u2019s groupings until they can take the debate further into the core of their societies.\u00a0 With time these methods can develop into the 4th voice of social steering:\u00a0 augmenting the overstretched mechanism of political representation, the inertia of the civil service and the easily skewered perspective of the press with a vivid vital contribution by the hereto marginalised often highly educated next-generation.\u00a0 I think of this work as <em>Rebooting Democracy</em>.\n\nI\u2019d like to suggest that this Rebooting Democracy as a key ER concern deserves further articulation. \u00a0 As things stand is not realistic to incorporate this into the work in Matera without a significantly extended presence.\u00a0 I am looking for a laboratory to develop readily applicable strategies and tools to engage both compact and extended populations in their pressing issues.\u00a0 I envisage a three stage ER package that would first provide a net-based preparation of regional collaborators.\u00a0 This would be followed by an active field team that administrates a process among a host population while transmitting the skills to replicate it.\u00a0 In the third stage ER would insure sufficient net follow-up and international reinforcement to support the applications. \u00a0\n\nBased as I am in Bergen, my first step is a pilgrimage to Iceland in mid-June.\u00a0 I intend to meet with Smarni and \u00c1sta and/or others who were central in the 2010 \u00dej\u00f3\u00f0fundur Process that so captured my imagination in Strasbourg.\u00a0 If the further development of this tool can be viewed as a pan-Nordic contribution to global culture, we may have sufficient leverage to work up a mobile workshop that can tweak the mechanisms through several editions before offering it to populations with perhaps a more urgent agenda. \u00a0\n\nWhat do you say? \u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-22 09:36:05", "updated_at": "2018-06-01 07:56:46.184982", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 486, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 15.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7055, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 629, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Temporary projects/ services or complete lifestyle redesign?</b>\n\nHi @Pauline,\u00a0\n\nSince you're into family care I thought Alberto's post about 3 adult couples going into an alternative living situation together might help.

The narrative is: we borrow and redeploy key ideas from monasticism towards social innovation, societal resilience, individual freedom and equality. We illustrate the concept (which has shown to have some traction) and move on to show it in vivo as embodied in unMonastery Matera. End with another saint, Augustine (<a href=\"http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/augustine/serm80.shtml\">sermon 80</a>):\u00a0\n\n<blockquote>\n\nMala tempora, laboriosa tempora, hoc dicunt homines. Bene uiuamus, et bona sunt tempora. Nos sumus tempora: quales sumus, talia sunt tempora.\n\n<em>The times are bad, the times are troubled, this men say. Let us live well, and times will be good. We <u>are</u> the times: the way we are is the way the times turn out</em>.\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>Format</h3>\n\nI (Alberto) propose the format of a collective presentation, as suggested by Riccardo. This requires the physical presence of about 4 unMonasterians on stage, + Alberto. The format is lively, but very difficult as there needs to be tight adherence to a script. Italian language also a difficulty, though short sentences can be memorized phonetically.\u00a0\n\nUpdate: Alberto's slides are now done, the text is written and timed. They are shared in the unMonastery =&gt; Communication shared Google Drive.\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Alberto: 7 minutes (11 slides) scripted presentation with slides about the concept</li>\n\n<li>one minute video by <a href=\"/u/nicobis\">@NicoBis</a>\u00a0(see in the comments below). <strong>unMonasterians use the last 10 seconds of the video to come on stage</strong>.</li>\n\n<li>5 unMonasterians: about 1 minute each, with little stories, projects, artifacts. Example:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\"I am <a href=\"/u/la_gaia\">@La_Gaia</a>,\u00a0and I come from London.\u00a0 I have been involved in the development of unMonastery since its conception at the Living on the Edge conference in 2012, fundamentally I am responsible for shaping the measurements and evaluation of the project. I bring my experience of network analysis, ensuring that we don\u2019t measure out what matters, unlike the empty numbers most projects gauge their success upon. This approach to evaluation is focused on enhancing the embedded and emergent process the unMonastery is focused on catalysing in Matera - using as a key marker the relationships that grow from the social impact of the model.\u00a0My role extends to advising the ongoing development, ensuring meaningful conflict resolution and contributing new recipes to the evolving cookbook of the unMonastery.\"</li>\n\n<li>\"I am <a href=\"/u/marc\">@Marc</a>, and I come from Burgundy in France. Together with schools in Matera, we are building a prototype for a totally open source solar tracker in both its software and hardware \u2013 a device that allows solar panels to follow the course of the sun, like a sunflower, increasing their output by 40%. The cost of energy consumption for an average family is \u20ac 1,150 a year, this device aims to remove that cost completely over a 6 year at most period.\u00a0 Solar trackers already exist, but they are closed, proprietary and quite expensive. We wish to build one that anyone can make or improve with an Arduino board, scavenged electric motors and cheap sensors, for a tenth of its current price. The project aims to be a first step towards towards real sustainable energy consumption.\"</li>\n\n<li>\"I am <a href=\"/u/bembo_davies\">@Bembo Davies</a>, and I come from Norway. I am the keeper of the Book of Errors. unMonasterians inherit from hacker culture a great attention for documentation; we wish to document our mistakes, of which we make many, so that our brethren unMonasterians in the next 200 years can better avoid them, and troubleshoot them when they can't be avoided.\"</li>\n\n<li>\u201cI am @RitaO, I come from Matera, I\u2019m the interface with the local community and I am an unMonasterian too. I got involved into unMonastery one year ago, when there was the first open meeting here \u00a0to introduce the main frame of the project and start a cooperation process with citizens about their vision of the town. I work on facilitating relationships with people and associations from Matera in order to develop the projects of the unMonasterians: on the other side, I would like to create a stable hub at unMonastery\u2019s place with the main goal to create a local network of active groups embedded into a huge European network of creatives and innovators. As an unMonasterian, I\u2019ve got a project based on designing goods for the unMon Community through a participatory process which aims to put together unMonasterians and local artisans, in order to create a stronger visual identity for the unMonastery itself, based on its own clear philosophy, and enable objects to speak for it\u201d.</li>\n\n<li>\"I am <a href=\"/u/kei\">@Kei</a>\u00a0Kreutler, and I come from New York. At unMonastery, I've established a node of Open Tech School in collaboration with Materani. The School currently holds free workshops on coding, physical computing, interactive games, web and mobile app design, and video production, with workshops evolving according to participants' interests. While offering a wide variety of skills, the project aims to teach individuals how to teach others - working toward the School's longevity beyond the unMonastery residency period. Open Tech School Matera leverages a global network within a local community - connecting to an initiative to make learning technical skills easy, fun and inherently social.\"</li>\n\n<li>others?</li>\n\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n<li>Alberto: 40 concluding seconds \u00a0of inspiration (1 slide)</li>\n\n<li>we exit, if possible, by stepping symbolically down into the audience.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<span>What to mention?</span>\n\nAll unMonastery projects are super-interesting.

The site identified for the Grand Prix Expo is an enormous housing estate, from which nearly all its previous residents have been evicted. It awaits redevelopment by private developers lendlease.

Treated way more to stop and searches than to awards or any sort of positive recognition. Although two artists are involved in this project, the creativity and skills of the young people will inform the whole thing throughout and the role of the artists will be to support/ feed that creativity. The purpose of the Grand Prix Expo will then be to recognise and celebrate young people (but not in such a mad corny/ cringy way like I just made it sound\u2026 hopefully the opposite)</li>\n\n<li><strong>#space </strong>I am keen to take the ideas out of their conventional vessels: artworks out the gallery, and youth work out the youth centre. Inevitably ideas and practices become fused to the environments they inhabit: institutions institutionalize. This is sometimes difficult to recognise until you start playing outside the playground and a whole world of possibilities opens up.</li>\n\n<li><strong>#relationship to the built environment </strong>No doubt part of a much broader project, is the question of our relationship to the built environment. The heygate estate, because of its (officially titled) \u2018interim\u2019 status presents us with a slightly altered experience of this relationship: the rules and grids as to how we are to use the space are largely absent. Some might find this scary, for others liberating, and some people perhaps both.

That is especially the case for physically disabled people.\n\nBut where does disability start? Is it the medical condition which is declaring people as disabled or is it the surroundings, the social environment? Is is the disability which disables?\n\nOur observation: People are being disabled \u2013 by other people, objects, environments. As such, people aren't disabled, but they are impaired. Only when their impairments collide with the environment, we can talk of disability. Also, often the language used is misleading and leaves a biased image of disability.\u00a0This should be a final call to apply universal design, as design should be as barrier-free as possible\u00a0and disability is to be understood multidimensional.\n\nTo face our design challenge, we agreed to do research about an superordinate topic: How can we change society's persepective about disability?\n\nWhile gathering information, we came up with further questions:\n\nHow can we make environments inclusive from the beginning so that it's not 'us' versus 'them' anymore? How can we focus on what they can do instead on what they can't do? How can we change the exclusive language? Do we only have disabled people because we lable them this way?\n\nAnd finally, how can we design something which is inclusive by design and not by label? This design question as our current state of research still has to be refined.\n\nIn order to focus our design question, we tried to narrow down our target group, which is kind of tricky as we want to reach out to the disabled people as well as 'society' as a whole. So we will try to integrate both in our future findings and design iterations.\n\nSomething which was very clear to us was the following: Shockingly, we know almost nothing about disabilities! So what do we know?\n\nWe only make assumptions about disabled people facing limitations, not being able to live freely, not being able to have a fulfilled life or to carry out all activities a non disabled person would do. We assume they always need a person they can depend on and face social isolation as well as isolation through physcial objects, meaning barriers.\u00a0Paradoxically, we don't know what they CAN do. We seem to only know what they can't do.\u00a0And we know that there is this exclusive setting for the disabled, prejudice and fear of contact.\n\nWe searched for leads and areas where disability appears. We found many organizations and projects, like community projects, workshops, events. So the group members did field research by observation, recording, filming, taking interviews and hands-on activities \u2013 with famous motivational speakers and fascinating personalities like Raul Krauthausen, by visiting workshops and by experiencing blindness in a museum.\n\nDisabled people need barrier-free environments, acceptance, suitable language and connection. They don't need pity, special treatment, including being labled.\n\nAs there are several types of disabilities, it seems impossible to to address all of them in our design challenge: hearing or visual impairment, psychological, cognitive or motoric impairment \u2013 all of them need a different approach in the design process. Thus, in the iteration process, we are about to develop designs that are as inclusive as possible and that ensure the fundamental right of social participation to people with all kinds of impairments.\n\nOur mission is to change the negative perception of disability and develop products or services so that people aren't defined by their disablity. We found that disabiltiy is more a social phenomenon: there is no autonomous person, being dependent\u00a0on someone is the most natural thing and everyone has their own restrictions. Childhood plays a crucial part in humans behaviour towards people who seem different as this stage is important for everyone's personal development. Kids don't have any fears of contact.\u00a0\n\nWe want to make visible that there are benefits for both sides, the care giver and care taker, and we want to enable people to connect with each other through design.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-05-31 21:17:17", "updated_at": "2018-05-26 05:21:46.607137", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 731, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18456, "user_id": 74, "topic_id": 1468, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Ok, but</b>\n\nWas this the same reason you were studying when you were 20?\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-07 08:11:57", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:43.088303", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 18, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32450, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5720, "post_number": 35, "raw": "<b>YAY!</b>\n\nDrupal win!

People can propose sessions, like in any unconference, but one or more curators ensure overall coherence of that conversation. Curation, in this context, means three things: preparatory work (online), building the program from the proposals and doing the follow up work.\n\nPrevious \\#LOTE formats have been short and intense, mostly focused on what happens during the days of the one physical event with little follow up or continuity. \\#LOTE4 is different: This time conversations are sustained over several months both before AND after the physical gathering, and a community of stakeholders \u00a0is built around a conversation over time.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">So how do \\#LOTE Conversations work?</h3>\n\nLOTE conversations aim to make it easier to be able to go from talking to building, especially when trying to do new things or lacking needed skills to be able to do so.\n\nYou<strong> <em>initiate or join a \\#lote4 conversation online</em></strong> to figure out how to solve a problem or build a solution. The conversation is aimed at discovering who and what is out there, exploring the existing knowledge and getting a shared understanding of what is needed or missing. Learn more here!\n\nYou<em> <strong>participate in the physical event</strong> </em>to meet the others, structure the work and identifying what resources and skills are needed for solving the problem or building the solution you care about. The outcome is a Viral Academy course to learn the skills you need or teach others with whom you have to work need in the context of achieving the goals identified in the session where it is fundraising, learning a new coding language or figuring out how to change a government policy or law. Then the skills are acquired in the process of realising the project or solution after the event, and passed on to more people.\u00a0\n\nYou <strong><em>document the results of the session</em></strong>, to share the knowledge produced and aggregated with everyone.\u00a0\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Format</h3>\n\n<strong>#LOTE4 consists of several conversations running in parallel.</strong>\u00a0 A conversation is an overarching theme and it is defined by a burning question, background information describing the context and why this question is relevant to everyone right now as well as reflections around how different stakeholders stand to benefit from progress made in answering the question. Curators define conversations that they believe will bring people to the table who would benefit directly by being in touch with our networks and ensure the advancement of the subject matter itself.\u00a0\n\nConversations open months before the physical event and continue for long after, possibly months or years depending on the topic and people involved. Conversations are curated by people with a high profile and a lot of credibility within a topic or field who want to gain deep understanding of the topic or challenge at hand.\n\n<strong>Curating a conversation means\u00a0prompting people to propose sessions, and being proactive.\u00a0</strong>The idea is create a safe space for constructive interaction between decision makers in the mainstream and radical people. It also means curation, selecting proposals. Maybe encouraging proponents to change or develop proposals to be better. And then being there in person and being part of the event.\n\n<strong>Edgeryders supports Conversation curators with secretariat work as well as the community building and management</strong> around a topic. Curators are encouraged to call in people who they think ought to be in the conversation and draw some support around the event.\n\n<strong>At the physical event each conversation is given a separate room for its sessions.\u00a0</strong>Each conversation is broken down into a 3 hr sessions. Each session has a leader and people facilitating and documenting discussions. People can wander between sessions.\u00a0\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Background</h3>\n\nDuring a \\#lote3 session a number of people agreed that a new event format was needed.

It started before the Egypt country visit early June, when I first started brainstorming potential stories for the Future Makers Case Studies. Greek Campus owner and businessman Al-Alfy had pointed them out to me during our brief meeting in mid-June. An old friend recommended Tagaddod during a chance reunion. In all, the premise was the same: \u201cTagaddod is working on the hard real-world issue of sustainable energy, and is unique in Egypt for doing so!\u201d\n\nI arranged to meet with Tagaddod Chief Operating Officer Ahmed Raafat July 21st despite my original objection of outlining an all too traditional profit-oriented business. As our discussion dragged on long past our meeting time, I started seeing Tagaddod less as a poster child of what a successful graduate of Egypt\u2019s buddying entrepreneurship scene might look like, and more as a cautionary tale of what challenges await an enterpriser in Egypt, and what it is like to live with a public sector as large and as involved as Egypt\u2019s. \n\n<span>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</span><span>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</span>\n\nThe German University in Cairo (GUC) was founded in October 2003 with a heavy emphasis on scientific and technical education. Located in one of Cairo\u2019s desert suburb\u2019s, the university moved to be the largest Educational Institute in Egypt that covers research linked to industry. It was here that Raafat had first learned and applied the production process for Biodiesel as part of his Bachelor Graduation Project in 2011. Transesterification, as the process is called, concerns the transformation of vegetable oil into Biodiesel. Glycerol, a liquid commonly used in pharmaceutical formulation is created as a byproduct. \n\nThen came the post-revolutionary Egyptian fuel crisis. Shortfalls in supply first started creeping in during <a href=\"http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/3/12/43458/Business/Economy/Whats-behind-the-third-Egyptian-fuel-crisis.aspx\">Summer 2012</a>, and became a <a href=\"http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/egypt-s-fuel-shortages-demonstrate-perfect-storm-economic-pressures\">regular occurrence</a> for the next 12 consecutive months.  Long lines formed at gas pumps: Some people bought their weekly groceries during the infamous pump waits. Electricity blackouts covered the country on a daily basis due to insufficient fuel to power the national gas-run energy plants. Financial reasons related to the rapidly deteriorating foreign exchange situation were cited as the primary reason. A catch-22: The Egyptian economy needs oil to function and earn its foreign reserves, while the same foreign reserves pay for the oil the economy badly needs. \n\nRaafat and his team saw in their graduation project a potential solution for this crippling situation. Eyeing opportunity, they applied for incubation within the <a href=\"/t/draft-nafham-peer-to-peer-online-education-in-egypt/4561\">Flat6labs programme</a> and got accepted in the Summer 2013 cycle. They started adopting regular working hours in pursuit of establishing a biodiesel company. In true Egyptian startup fashion, they branded their work with a one-word latin script interpretation of an arabic word: `Tagaddod`, meaning renewal. They delivered what Flat6labs required: A business plan, a working prototype and a first customer. \n\n<img alt=\"Tagaddod at Flt6labs, Copyright at The Atlantic\" src='/uploads/default/original/2X/2/22db7e4d1bcc1154b5fdca168a57488147989a4b.jpg' style=\"width: 570px; height: 380px;\">\n\n \n\nTagaddod reclaims used vegetable oils and produces biodiesel. The resulting product can be used in standard diesel engines, or be blended with other petrodiesels. The original team of five relied on blueprints and knowledge from the <a href=\"http://opensource.com/business/10/3/open-biodiesel\">burgeoning online open source biodiesel community</a> to design their first Transesterification machine. It was capable of outputting some 100 litres of biofuel every 8 hours at a consistent quality; even if not yet entirely up to certification standards. It arranged to collect used restaurant waste oil from Tavco - one of Egypt\u2019s largest tourism companies - in exchange for use-ready biodiesel for the companies buses.\n\nYet the company faced certain death in light of its dwindling financial resources. The first partners quit. Their experience largely mirrored Alberto\u2019s <a href=\"/t/egypt-mission-report-draft/4495\">Egypt Mission Report</a>: Post-incubation funding is rare, and the private entrepreneurship scenes\u2019 inability to move past the first stage.\n\nTagaddod applied for a competition hosted by the Small and Medium Enterprise Investment Fund Bedaya, which in turn was established by the General Authority for Investment, or GAFI. The 50\u2019000 EGP public prize money awarded allowed the startup to rent itself a tiny workshop in the Cairo suburb of Maadi, buy necessary input materials and perfect their transesterification process to finally reach the consistent quality mandated by the international biodiesel specification <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASTM_D6751\">ATSM</a>, and certification by the Ministry of Trade and Industry. The government supplied the budding startup with a lifeline at the critical point. Tagaddod was saved for the time being, and had a theoretical capacity of 9 tonnes per month. \n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Biofuel: Persona non-grata? </h3>\n\nBiofuel is a burgeoning international market, and has seen tremendous growth since the early noughts. Increased production of biofuel is cited as a root cause of the world food price crises of 2008; then the United States was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_vs._fuel\">devoting some 25% of its agricultural land</a> for corn destined to biodiesel production. Competition between fuel and food for agricultural capacity, as well increasingly proven environmental effects caused biofuel to quickly fall out favor as a green energy solution. \n\nUnlike the aforementioned traditional biofuel, Tagaddod relies on waste vegetable oil as its primary input material. Recycling what is essentially used cooking oil has benefits beyond the immediate biodiesel: A 2008 <a href=\"http://www.ijest.org/jufile?c2hvd1BERj0xOTQ=\">study</a> from Cairo university reported Egyptians to consume in excess of 1 million tonnes of vegetable oil every year, which mostly end in the countries\u2019 sewage system. Oil discharge into sewers causes a serious filtration problem, a litre of oil could contaminate up to one million litres of water if unfiltered. Poured oil builds up in sewer systems and constricts water flow. The same Cairo University study argues a unit of vegetable oil to roughly produce a unit of biodiesel. Roughly calculated, recycling used cooking oil could cover 10% of national diesel consumption.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\"><strong>The real world</strong></h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Getting the Oil</h3>\n\nTrash collection in Cairo is largely handled by a large informal community of garbage collectors known as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zabbaleen\">Zabaleen</a>. Extensive research was conducted on the system, with a consensus emerging to its <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5b56eQ_fJk\">remarkable efficiency</a> in terms of percentage of trash collected and recycled. Tagaddod launched with the idea to collect cooking oil from larger producers such as restaurants and hotels. They had missed the Cairo oil traders, as Rafaat calls them, who had been collecting used cooking oil informally for a long time, in a similar fashion to the Zabaleen. According to Raafat, the Cairo oil traders cluster around the Mosque of Amr ibn al-As area in historic Cairo. They are a largely unstudied phenomena. \n\nThe Cairo oil traders have a wide network of suppliers that covering metropolitan Cairo. Workers, who might otherwise have been homeless and without employment, collect and transport the waste cooking oil for sale to the Cairo oil traders. They in turn sell to export clients; primarily in Germany, Spain and Italy. Some oil is used as greasing materials in shipping and heavy machinery. None of it recycled or processed; the simple act of trading is quite profitable on its own. Like the Zabaleen, the informal system of organising the collection is too complex and entrenched in tradition for the western firm to emulate. It just works. \n\nThe first brushes with this invisible but mature system were a real-life lesson for Tagaddod. Restaurants and food carts would refuse to hand over their used oil. Over-eager oil-collectors would pick fights. The only rational decision was to cooperate with the Oil traders rather than try to compete with it. A ban on the export of used mineral oils enacted by the Egyptian Trade Federation in 2013 (Unverified) pushed prices down and allowed Tagaddod to source their Oil from the Cairo oil traders cheaply. In fact, the presence of a well0-functioning system is a boon for Tagaddod, as it guarantees a steady supply of input material at low costs and with no need for a costly collection infrastructure. \n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Reaching Consumers</h3>\n\n \n\nAt present, Tagaddod has built a new facility in the industrial zone of 6th of October with a total production capacity of 100 tonnes per month. While the cooperation with the Cairo oil traders now feeds most of this new plants capacity needs; Raafat described to me how his team wished to be more proactive in combatting low consumer environmental awareness levels in Egypt. Hence the Green-pan campaign. \n\n \n\nGreen-pan is a community outreach effort by Tagaddod, where consumers are asked to collect their own cooking oil waste and donate it to Tagaddod; who in turn collect it from the city for their own recycling operations. In practice, collecting from consumers is an unprofitable enterprise that the Cairo oil traders stay away from. Collected amounts are too small to cover the associated collection costs. At current; the campaign covers just 1% of the firms total capacity. Cooperation attempts with corporate CSR departments generally failed due to Tagaddod\u2019s registration status as a for-profit company. Negotiations with environmental NGO\u2019s reach a critical point discussing who will cover the cost burden. \n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">The state</h3>\n\nRaafat described how the market for recycled Biodiesel in Egypt is still open. He welcomed the new entrant on the block; another startup called Biodiesel Misr. The real challenge are not potential future competitors but the state. First, restrictive and clashing rules follow his business like minefields waiting to explode at every new turn. Raafat described how the aforementioned 2013 ban on the export of used mineral oils caused a lot of the Cairo oil traders to cease collecting oil temporarily in light of the problem of whom to sell it to. Tagaddod itself faces a continuing problem in that it is not allowed to sell its production-ready biodiesel locally. In Egypt, all oil is acquired by the state-run General Authority for Petroleum at market price, subsidised by the state and distributed to Points of Sale. The current charter of the General Authority for Petroleum only deals with fossil-based petrochemicals and does not acknowledge recycled biodiesel; in plain words Raafat can\u2019t sell his produce locally. \n\nI remembered how Tagaddod started out from the fuel shortages of 2012/2013 with the aim of selling locally produced Biodiesel at the pump and escaping the foreign reserves trap. Now, the team had to turn to export the finished product as a solution. The aforementioned ban on exports of oil, once a boon for Tagaddod was now a menace. A third attempt was to set up shop in the export-oriented Free Zone of Suez, which is exempt from the regulations of the Egyptian Trade Chamber. This application was in turn denied on the premise that oil is a national good that should not be allowed to be exported out of the country. As Rafaat described his Kafkaesque conundrum to what should be a simple transaction, I wondered at how big the opportunity and potential rewards had to be to keep him devoted to this project, and new investors coming on board. \n\nA new biodiesel law regulating sales to the General Authority of Petroleum is allegedly in the making, and will await ratification as soon as a new parliament is elected. This law would be a boon for Tagaddod. Interestingly, state actors see the same opportunity and are already preparing for the state\u2019s entrance into this lucrative market: A <a href=\"http://www.thecairopost.com/news/156727/business/protocol-on-recycling-cooking-oil-into-biodiesel-signed-in-egypt\">protocol</a> on recycling cooking oil has been signed by the Ministry of Supply this June. Alberto had referred to the \u201cstate\u2019s obvious delivery ability\u201d. As I contemplated these developments I realised how the same state that enabled Tagaddod to live to see another day through the Bedaya entrepreneurship competition was now in the business of hollowing Tagaddod\u2019s out. \n\nAs I re-read Alberto\u2019s Egypt mission report, I thought about his recommendations \u201cfor the full potential of entrepreneurship to bear fruit\u201d: Fixing the regulatory environment is key. University research is actually quite developed in the engineering disciplines, as demonstrated by Tagaddod\u2019s origin as a university project. Yet, research into the Cairo oil traders and their methods is non-existence and proof of the weakness of social science in Egypt. Tagaddod is a rare example of a company started by an incubator, sustained by a business competition and now on its way to secure additional investing to scale forward. In light of the macabre regulatory environment they operate in; their current success should be a testament to the ability of entrepreneurship to allow youth to take matters into their own hands.", "created_at": "2017-08-09 22:00:00", "updated_at": "2018-05-28 11:11:07.508424", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2568, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 7.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28976, "user_id": 605, "topic_id": 1549, "post_number": 18, "raw": "<b>\u0397ello Davide, \n\nof course you</b>\n\n\u0397ello Davide,\u00a0\n\nof course you are very welcome to join any breakout session you feel like!\u00a0\n\nGo in and suggest to the facilitators your points of view and what you would like to see there\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSee you in the \\#lote\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-10 19:49:28", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:39.470195", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 62, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [12166], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14157, "user_id": 82, "topic_id": 2902, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Wow, welcome!</b>\n\nWelcome, good to have you here.

They talk and regularly meet with one another. Opportunities are there, to discuss topics. But since these things do not interest them, they do not address these issues.\n\nAs <a href=\"http://voir.ca/mario-asselin/2012/01/21/gouvernement-transparent-donnees-accessibles/\">Mario Asselin pointed out in Voir,</a> on January 21, (my translation) \" <em>There are more citizens in favor of Nerd Plan than of a Northern plan, which is proposed by the Quebecker's political class</em>.\" What he said is rather hard to translate, here is the original quote: \u00abI<em>l est davantage le fait d\u2019un groupe de citoyens qui souhaitent un Plan Nerd plut\u00f4t qu\u2019un plan Nord pour le Qu\u00e9bec que de la classe politique.</em>\u00bb (And he included the following link to <a href=\"http://www.afroginthevalley.com/2011/10/plan-nerd\">Plan Nerd</a>)\n\nIf you follow this link by Sylvain Carle, you will read: \"<em>What we lack here is <strong>POLITICAL WILL</strong>, it is the first fundamental condition</em>\" [for the development of innovation].\n\nI would add another condition. Diversification of strategies.\n\nAs we have explored, in <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/share-your-ryde/mission_case/moi-lalg%C3%A9rie-et-le-d%C3%A9veloppement-durable\">Jamel's mission report about innovation in Algeria</a>, one single minded ideology (ie putting all the eggs in one basket) tends to limit success. What we have here is a massive investment in projects that do not retain the support of the population, while the projects that citizens would prefer continue to be ignored.\n\nIf the Open government partnership had never existed, I would have been inclined to think that the ideas that we proposed are ridiculous, too ambitious, impossible to achieve. While on one hand, on September 1st, 2011, a government leader said, 'There is no solution', 20 days later, more than 40 countries were mobilized by the United States and Brazil, around similar ideas. There was a gathering of Heads of State and senior officials from 46 countries in New York on September 20, 2011, to launch the OGP.\n\nUSA and Brazil, 2 countries, have led the efforts that led to the ratification of the Declaration of the OGP at the UN.\n\nTo hope for open government to become a priority of the OIF, this is not utopia. And I don't think that it should be considered either as ahead of its time. No, I'm sorry but I think that these issues are contemporary and should be explored now.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://cdn-elle.ladmedia.fr/var/plain_site/storage/images/people/la-vie-des-people/news/buzz-barack-obama-danse-la-salsa-avec-une-autre-femme/12442761-1-fre-FR/Buzz-Barack-Obama-danse-la-salsa-avec-une-autre-femme_mode_une.jpg\"> <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.perche-quebec.com/files/hillary/images/hillary1.jpg\">\n\nPhtos: Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.kbyutv.org/programs/smallfortunes/images/luminaries/maria.jpg\"> <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Dilma_Rousseff_-_foto_oficial_2011-01-09.jpg/200px-Dilma_Rousseff_-_foto_oficial_2011-01-09.jpg\"> <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQg32c-kspHe8qkGfxvYx7W8SK4pqlIXW25WIdaVwhkhP1n4g1DaajIZkr62Q\">\n\nPhotos: Maria Otero, Dilma Rousseff, and Antonio Patriota\n\nLeaders, like Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Maria Otero, from the USA, and Dilma Rousseff (president), Antonio Patriota (Minister of Foreign Relations) from Brazil, had a similar vision, and they did something about it.\n\nQuebec and France, 2 States, are current leaders in the Francophonie. These two countries should take the lead, like USA and Brazil did, to deploy a movement in favor of open government throughout the Francophonie. These 2 States, Quebec and France, should also join the OGP, and propose to the 43 members of this movement strategies based on diversification and cultural diversity.\n\nMoney and in-kind donations were given by the public and corporate sector, as well as foundations, for the OGP project to take place.

For this reason, I presented a complete project of research (<a href=\"http://ict4rd.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/my_own_project.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">abstract</a>) in order to develop into the Information and Knowledge Society Doctoral Programme at Internet Interdisciplinary Institute (IN3) of UOC.\n\nMy experience in some professional projects related to ITC and rural development and the academic career about the Network Society approach me to this proposal. The interest for research has given me a rigorous point of view to be applied to professional projects. In addition, my experience in professional projects gives me some examples for academic research. \u00a0\n\nRural Development is a valuable concept for the development of any country. If we speak about economic development in any country, we should not forget rural areas. Their specific characteristics, geographical situation, demographic evolution and socio-economic development are more difficult than other geographical areas.\n\nThroughout history, rural world has needed to develop collaborative ways to work together. These relationships have turned into communities: social and economic spaces. These organizations responded to their member needs to share and create more beneficial ways to collaborate. Beyond traditional forms of collaboration (guilds, associations, organizations, etc.), the rural world has developed other kind of synergies to benefit their members.\n\nThis project deals with analysing how the new tools associated with the Network Society allow the rural world to begin new ways to (socially) relate and to (economically) develop on the Internet. However, the existing organizations have the opportunity to adopt new structures and new forms to communicate through technological tools, and to collaborate online.\n\nThat is the reason why, governments carry out rural development policies in most countries. For instance, the European Union encourages policies at a European level for rural economic development through the LEADER programme.\n\nMy focus is Catalonia, where rural areas were the most important communities from the IX century until the second half of XIX century. Then, the Industrial Revolution changed demography, social-economic relations and led the rural areas to a non-developed stage.\n\nOn the one hand, my main interest is focused on the observation of the agricultural food product launched by a producer or a community of producers. On the other hand, a community of consumers concentrates around that product. The project herein focuses on the influence of the ITC in those communities, which is the aim of this research.\n\nThis proposal begins with a previous research, the final project of the Master in Information and Knowledge Society: <a href=\"http://ict4rd.net/2011/10/16/ict4rd-la-conca-de-barbera-full-document/\" target=\"_blank\">The rural Catalan communities facing the Information and Knowledge Society new scenario, the case of \u2018La Conca de Barber\u00e0\u2019</a>. (Espelt, 2011). This experience has given me the possibility to taste an approach to this research field.\u00a0\n\nThe results and conclusions I got in that first research have encouraged me to present this proposal. My research is an approach to the rural development in the era of digital revolution. I have worked to build a new academic literature point of view and research methodology to the rural development. My approach works in relation to the different disciplines of ICT4D (Information and Communication Technologies for Development) and to the economic history of cooperatives.\u00a0\n\nI hope my contribution will help this mission. Any comment or reference could be useful for me.

Yes, I'm a police officer, actually gendarmes officer (in Italy - carabinieri), in human resources departament. I worked for five years as a trainer in the Gendarmerie Bihor. I have n translated it yet a document about the selective collection system. I hope to do soon. These are paper and PET bottles (for juice, mineral water). I am a part of two local groups working in Oradea. One deals with indicators of welfare of citizens and use the method Spirale (I think it is a French innovation !). In 2011 the Association Ulpianum wanted to participate in a Grundtvig Partnership, called E.C.L.I.P.S.E.S. (Ecological, Citizenship, Lifestyle, Intergenerational, Partnership, Solidarity, Economy, Sustainability.) But we did not receive funding due to insufficient funding. We worked very well with the italian association called Fattoria Pugliese diffusa in Taurisano. I am interested in any idea of \u200b\u200bcollaboration, including Grundtvig.\n\nAbout our asociation...\n\nSports Club Ulpianum Oradea was born of a desire to combine outdoor sports activities with care for the environment, the family being in the center of each business. It is known that the sport is practised individually or in teams usually either male or female or juniors But our association wants to develop a new concept, the whole family being involved in physical and recreational activities in a way that will develop certainly in the future.\n\nSports Club Ulpianum Oradea, founded in 2008, is a nonprofit legal entity of private law, non-profit, with the primary goal of sports development, environmental protection, education of young people but adults as well as promoting volunteering. The sports association has as active members those who wish to conduct such activities aiming at sustaining and improving life. Currently the club has 426 active members, 314 from Oradea and from 112 Bihor county. Add to this the families of members, including children so that the total members are over 1,000 people. Because the organization of the activities, there are many people who have joined the association, to practice sports activities.\n\nWe organized many tennis, volleyball, athletics, badminton, table tennis, tennis, chess and darts competitions, paying special attention to youth involvement in such activities. In 2009 we organized a mini-football championship of Bihor county for high schools, attended by a total of 30 teams.\n\nUlpianum members put into practice a system of selective collection of PET bottles and paper in order to protect the environment. During 2008 - 2011 approximately 2000 kg of PET bottles and 3200 kg of paper have been collected and the system has proved its viability, starting to be implemented in educational institutions in Oradea. The organization participated in the September 2010 national activities Lets Do It Romania, managing Nojorid greening forest edge, near the city of Oradea, the lake shores Tileagd and the banks of the river Crisul Repede.\n\nThe club has a proper material equipment, evidenced by a multifunctional field, a playground for children, a gym and practice materials for many different sports. We had built locker rooms and toilets for athletes, a medical and fitness gym and a multipurpose room for the pursuit of cultural and educational activities and sports. In the next period a self defense room will be arranged and equipped and a panel of sports climbing, with a height of 8 meters as well.\n\nCS Ulpianum aims at working not only in sport but in all those areas that allow initiative, collaboration, acquiring new knowledge, and generally develop a healthy spirit, based on an active life. Such activities aim at increasing the accessibility, quality and volume of mobility in Europe, for people who want to improve education, to improve quality and increase the volume of cooperation between organizations involved in adult education, to facilitate the development of innovative practices in adult education and their transfer from one participating country to another, to support the development of new technology-based information content, service development, innovative teaching methods and practices for lifelong learning and to multiply pedagogical approaches to improve management and adult education organizations.\n\nSome of the projects developed by the association are:\n\n1. Bihor County - A Clean Environment Through Everyone\u2019s Concern - the selective collection of waste PET bottles and paper, a project within Tara lui Andrei campaign, the Your Town section supported by Petrom in January 2010.\n\n2. Project \u201eGreen Island of Small Sportpersons\u201d within the Green Space Programme \u00a0- Request for funding for Urban Green Space component, Partnership Foundation (Moll Romania)\n\n3. How High Would You Get - Health by Climbing - project grants submitted within local budget funds of Oradea city \u00a0\n\n4. The First Step - Together We Protect Nature in public education and awareness programs for environmental protection, coordinated and funded by the Environment Fund Administration-September 2010\n\n5. We Also Need Grass - a competition to identify environmental problems in rural communities from Romania - project developed by the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux (NACAB) and Save the Danube Delta Association (SDS). Ulpianum Sports Club was nominated for the problem identified. The idea was published in May 2010 their Compendium of rural ecology;\n\n6. Eco Friends Hopscotch - a project initiated by the French Embassy in Romania, Cooperation et Action Cultural Service\n\n7. Grundtvig Learning Partnership, in ecology - in Grundtvig, for adult learning throughout life, funded by the European Commission, along with seven European countries (Poland, Italy, Germany, Slovenia, Spain, Greece and Turkey). This project will be submitted for consideration on 21 February 2011. If approved, the partnership will begin in August and will last two years.\n\nUlpianum Sports Club is supported mainly from membership dues, donations and sponsorships but also recyclable waste recovery activities as part of the results of environmental education supported by our association.\n\nSports Club Ulpianum Oradea is guided by the following motto: \u201eSport gives days of life and living today\u201d.\n\nIn our future work we want to act in the spirit of JJ Rousseau,who once said: \u201eIf you want to have an intelligent and endowed child you must help him develop the force that the intellignce will nurture to him/her, make him/her healthy and robust to become wise and court ... let him/her work, get used to act.

A few years ago me and my NGO, Poiana lui Iocan embarked in a somewhat similar project, of trying to understand what is the core of our grassroots initiatives in Romania, what are the strategies, how to they communicate and interact with one another and most importantly how do they actually allow people to participate and engage outside their group.\n\nAt the time though, I think there where other dots to connect, for our NGO, for the innovators that didn't see themselves as a community that could strive through collaboration and for me who just finished architecture and wanted to get more into understanding cities through interdisciplinary interactions.\n\nI think now is a better time to start this, also for the emerging community and for me as a urban studies\u00a0master student in a european wide interdisciplinary program that focused on exactly this, understanding the role of these stakeholders in a number of european cities.\n\nI don't know if i am eligible as i am still abroad until the end of June but i would be most honored to be taken in consideration, partially because of my experience in interdisciplinary urban research and partially because my current NGO projects in Bucharest focus on just that, discovering alternatives to our classic city development strategies and trying to build a new inclusive narrative in which all of these stakeholders might better negotiate to reach new outcomes so we've already done an extensive research on existing initiatives in Bucharest.\u00a0\n\nI think my colleague has already talked to you guys about our on-going project, Urboteca and how we want to use it as a tool to get closer to communities and empower them to get involved in city related issues. Its a test and I think we have learned a lot by doing and by failing at reaching our initial goals, but most importantly its a platform that can be reused to serve new goals. We would be more then glad to use our mobile pavilion to promote the practices discovered through your program.\n\nAt the same time we are hard at work on a project that wants to promote open data and i think that this would be the perfect medium for cross-sector collaboration bringing together journalists as story tellers , design as visual communication, grass root initiatives, and citizens as local experts, the growing local tech community and other instigators to change that want to base their stories on complex yet understandable data sets.\n\nGoing beyond the scope of this job call I would really want to meet and discuss the potential of a longer lasting collaboration and see how we can develop new stuff together, outside our professional boxes.\n\nCheers,\n\nRazvan\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-16 19:17:07", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:24.909057", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 492, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2636], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9537, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4452, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Also: opendataforafrica.org</b>\n\nThe African Development Bank has a friendly-looking site that collects and displays datasets from all over Africa.

The full session description is\u00a0<a href=\"/t/is-the-future-of-disaster-response-in-hands-of-stewards-of-digital-data-networks-platform/3737\">here.</a></em>\n\n<a href=\"http://gwob.org/\">Geeks without bounds</a>\n\nBurners without borders: It's people \"hardened\" for infrastructure-scarce situations by the Burning Man festival, now going to disaster struck areas for disaster response.\n\n<strong>Millie</strong>\u00a0\n\nI spent a couple of years working with UN on disaster. Most of the money is spent\u00a0working with states; its efficiency is dismal. Not good enough.\u00a0\n\nThe idea behind this session is that we are starting to have online inventories of what Robin Chase would call excess capacity: people in AirBnB have extra rooms; Uber has access to an army of people with cars; TaskRabbit etc.\n\nNext year we at UNDP we would like to have an event in which to bring together sharing economy corporates but also \"people helping people\";\u00a0this concentrates investment in a very small segment of the society.\u00a0\n\nActive capacity: By encouraging people to take secondary role(s) that activate at need we increase resilience of the society.\n\nSensory capacity: Real time analysis of public (meta-)data to detect and track disruptions.\n\nOnline platforms\u00a0are\u00a0a way to map out the resources that we have. The\u00a0idea is to how to have the communities work on disaster response without the state using online communities. Or to map the different infrastructure systems and what they provide, to be able to know what can be repurposed in case of disaster. For example, letting Coca Cola beverage suppliers to supermarkets use their supply infrastructure to deliver potable water instead.\n\nThis could be prototyped with a forward-looking mayor in 2015.\n\n<strong>Leo Dearden</strong>\n\nCommunication breaks down in natural disasters. So I guess the enabling capacity is mesh networks and people who know how to run them: things like network servers in a box, solar powered or whatever. My advice is communication first; and make communication as independent as possible from any grid.\n\n<strong>Alberto\u00a0</strong>\n\n3 years ago a big earthquake hit Emilia Romagna, where I am from. Telecomms disruption happened in a patchy way: some of it went down, but not all. People reacted by opening their wifis and created a sort of better-than-nothing network in 2 hours.\u00a0\n\n<strong>Nadia\u00a0</strong>\n\nAirBnB-like actors are actually in the way. They try to prevent \"spokes\" to connect to each other. When the disaster hits, they can not talk except by going through AirBnB.\u00a0\n\nWhat do people need to know?\n\nWhat do people need? [Leo: SCIM\u00a0/\u00a06 ways to die]\n\nOn a political level create a context that seemingly are not for disaster but they help in this scenario;\u00a0Encourage and incentivise the activities that contribute (as a secondary effect) to disaster preparedness and resilience.\u00a0\n\n<strong>Gaia</strong>\n\nGiving competent/skilled people\u00a0(e.g. nurses)\u00a0permission to deal with a situation \"Deal with this by whatever (legal) means you think best\". Need to identify key skilled workers, ahead of time.\n\nCity of San Francisco has a website with disaster preparedness instructions to its citizens:\u00a0<a href=\"http://toolkit.sf72.org/\">http://toolkit.sf72.org/</a>\n\n<strong>Leo Dearden</strong>\n\nExample\u00a0 for citizen-driven disaster preparedness: There is a local town in California of a local currency backed by beans and rice, used as a\u00a0 preparedness means for potential disruption to food supply (there, up to\u00a0 2 months due to one frightline through earthquake-affected area).\n\nFantastic story: a town in inland California is connected to logistics only by a rail and a road next to each other, both highly vulnerabeable to earthquake. It has only about five days of food. So they issued a local currency backed by beans. It's just another local currency, it encourages local economic activity and all. But it does mean that you back them by silos fulls of beans. If disaster strikes, people empty the granaries and literally eat their cash. It also means people trust the currency more when the disaster has not hit!\n\n<strong>Ben\u00a0</strong>\n\nThere is a scene playing resilience games. They have a lot of knowledge about how to react to many kinds of disasters.

Check out Burners Without Borders.)\n\nThe other is more engineered: inventory the excess capacity, the shovels and the extra rooms, and the toolboxes and the drinkable water (but also the retired electrical engineers) and work it from there.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-01-12 12:22:24", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:22.954181", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 933, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28926, "user_id": 2913, "topic_id": 5571, "post_number": 15, "raw": "<b>EMDesk account</b>\n\n@luce\n\ncan you invite, please, Franca to the EMDesk?\n\nlocati.franca@gmail.com\n\n", "created_at": "2016-06-07 13:22:43", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:39.164888", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 23, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [28822], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28785, "user_id": 2201, "topic_id": 4454, "post_number": 16, "raw": "Thanks @trythis I relax by checking my friends' news feed on fb...i guess i follow the right people ;-)\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-26 12:40:06", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:38.485370", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 21, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [28606], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12227, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 3772, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Ok..</b>\n\n@Nadia did you get to meet these guys in person when you were in Boston?

The following is an overview of where we stand following up on the richness of ideas shared by Edgeryders through their mission reports and input at LOTE, and practical opportunities that arised.\n\nAfter the conference we ended up with <strong>two rather different takes on learning</strong>, both reformative: one that proposes tweaking current systems in terms of evaluation and openness of educational content -<a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/where-edgeryders-dare/mission_case/learning-lote-session\">see the session summary by Andrea Latino</a>, and other that's more focused on student challenges and centered on freedom of thinking, put forward by Ola in <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/where-edgeryders-dare/mission_case/learning-my-scattered-thoughts-and-response-learning-lote-session\">this report</a> where he launches a set of intriguing questions:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Why are young people today find schooling un-neccessary or uninteresting?</li>\n\n<li>Is school preparing us to identify and solve complex problems creatively (ourselves or in group?) How can we solve that?</li>\n\n<li>How can we transform the school system from a system that today create extrinsic motivation (based on rewards &amp; grades) to a system where youngsters can keep, find &amp; shape intrinsic motivation (curiosity, self-guided, self-motivation)? ...</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nAs usual, we're calling Edgeryders to join conversation and help flesh these out! Our work trying to answer some of these questions starts with two proposals, feel free to join any!!\n\n<h3>1. We have been invited to provide an addition to a motion of the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly that states:</h3>\n\n<blockquote><a href=\"http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc10/EDOC12256.pdf\">The use of drugs and self-harm by young people seem to be the result of a general lack of self-esteem and an inability to address the challenges and responsibilities linked to the future. [...] The weakening of family ties and the inadequacy of schooling in moral values, civil virtues and duties are fostering loneliness and very serious psychological depression in the younger generation.</a></blockquote>\n\n<strong>Response to the motion</strong><strong>:</strong> we're focusing on learning initiatives and processes that surfaced from the Edgeryders community as solutions. The argument is that these measures are preventative of loneliness, violence and self-harm. How? By fostering recognition of young people, healthy communication and connections, as well as immersion in communities.  <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LqX1mHnwvSpXwwl7akjdOxTDOqm9sOyNVsFESxyEAR8/edit\">Join the community as we collectively draft this!</a>\n\nDeadline for final report (max 5 pages) is<strong> August 20.</strong>\n\n<h3> 2. Edgeryders participate at The London Festival of Education on the 17th of November 2012.</h3>\n\nBridget Mckenzie will be speaking at this, and she's planning to address how an educated person is a radical bio-empathetic resilient (a Edgeryder?), with abilities such as learning rapidly, flipping dilemmas, making and mending, creating commons.

Two lives, really. Stressful but you get to know some creative freaks. Perspective, as usual, comes later.\n\nI found how, as a citizen, you can ask naive questions which you can't ask from any official possition. That's cool, and extremely useful. More people should try it, really.\n\nAs a public servant, I have of course nothing to say. :-) Unless this counts (I think it doesn't, but comes close): as a doctor, I <a href=\"http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/002884.html\">told the official flu networks about wikipedia</a>, to challenge them into contributing, and probably they did ... as citizens.\n\nReflecting on both sides and beyond, I think there are several resilience <u>gaps</u>, each with things to do.\n\nFirst there's the <u>govt-activists</u> gap identified by the likes of FluTrackers, FluWiki, GetPandemicReady, ReadyMoms, etc. At the time, it was said that the govt was dropping a 60 meter piece of rope down a ... 100 meter cliff. Govts were said to be doing lots of work, and citizens were doing lots of creative stuff, but the two sides didn't get to meet properly.\n\nGovts have difficulty in acknowledge worst cases. Maybe even more than individual citizens.\n\nBoth have difficulties in acknowledging usable strengths that challenge the status quo, and our mind models.\n\nThen there's the <u>individual resilience</u> gap identified by Vinay in his \"Dealing with security\" (which I translated into Spanish and anyone is <a href=\"http://imaginethecanaries.blogspot.com.es/2011/09/why-i-love-scim-and-what-to-do-about-it.html\">most welcome</a> to try and translate into other languages): individuals and families in non-camping situations can't protect themselves much from the \"infrastructural six ways to die\": too hot, too cold, thirst, hunger, disease, injury.\n\nIf we look at it in terms of gaps, I think there's also a gap <u>between hard resilience and soft resilience</u>. It's true that we need water (hard) but it's us people who go get the water (soft). Which is why I like Vinay's SCIM as a language, because it might eventually (if used) let soft people talk about hard things, and get things done in a rush, if and when needed.\n\n\"If and when needed\" is of course \"right now\" in many parts of the world. If not everywhere.\n\nBeing practical, the gap that intrigues me most is the \"<u>fast adoption</u>\" gap. How fast can we go from \"permaculture text-books\" to \"<a href=\"http://www.appropedia.org/Emergency_permaculture\">emergency permaculture</a>\"? How fast can we go from \"all hell breaks loose\" to \"every family has a stove, a water filter and an 'off-grid' toilet\"?\u00a0I'm trying to help answer that by giving some energy to our <a href=\"http://www.canarnova.org\">local makers</a>: they happen to be creative and practical, so I guess that kind of group is an asset in every community.\n\nYou see, in the end we'll all be dead (at least for a while, depending on beliefs). Before that, there's this tendency to get up after we fall. So I'm intrigued by the notions of not falling too hard and getting up fast. As individuals working in groups/networks for communities, and facilitated by whoever can lend a hand, govts included.\n\nSo, as they say in the Linux world, it's not \"where do you want to go today\" or \"where do you want to go tomorrow\" but rather \"<a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/resilience-session\">are you coming or what?</a>\". (Most likely, you're doing the walking already and I'm the one who needs to learn. So <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/resilience-session\">come and tell us</a>.)\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-22 07:52:05", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:00.918160", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 676, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 1.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [13929], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2600, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2567, "post_number": 1, "raw": "I am curious, [Marc]: how goes this project?

I am looking for CS hosts for me and my friends because when traveling, we don't like to do the typical touristy things - rather we look for a truly genuine cultural experience. We believe one must live and get to know the locals of wherever they are traveling to. Locals can show a side of the target destination that no guidebook or website can. That is why we would like to stay with you, a local.\n\nPlease, let me know if you are available and how many people you can host. We are all experienced travelers and do not need someone to babysit us, but we do appreciate a good talk over a drink and we\u2019d love to hear about your favorite spots in town, maybe you could take us there in your spare time? That would be awesome!\n\nIn return we can offer you to participate in one of our sessions and/or dinner parties and meeting our community, which consists of hackers, activists and just normal people from all walks of life that want to make a difference in this world. We promise to be respectful, contribute to your daily life as much as possible and help you with household chores, of course :-)\n\nFYI The LOTE series are collaborative events where Edgeryders come together to learn from each other, plan the work ahead and have fun. We pick a theme that is somewhat itchy for Edgeryders all over and crack it wide open so that we to arrive at fresh thinking and projects. This year we want to learn from fuckups so to speak, and local <a href=\"http://www.antiheroes.org/\">Antiheroes</a> are providing the inspiration.

You can't really speak of a rush here, and if someone wasn't willing to get a profile, which\n\ndoesn't take a lot of time, that would most probably set their chances to get hosted by me to around 0.\n\n1) Have a good profile!\n\nWrite a description of yourself, so that your host gets a good idea about who they're letting into their flat.\n\nIt's all trust based, so you have to pay that forward by being willing to share something about yourself.\n\nUpload around 3-5 pictures that show you, and stuff you care about or of yourself while doing stuff you like.\n\n2) If you say that you don't host, it's a good idea to mention at some point, why you don't. I'm a lot more\n\nlikely to host people, who don't host themselves, if they state a good reason for that. And seriously, if you're\n\nnot even willing to chose \"wants to meet up\" - are you sure, you're on the right platform? \"Wants to meet up\"\n\nis for people who can't host, but who are willing to show travellers around.\n\n3) Maybe the\u00a0<strong>most important part of a good CS request</strong>: Refer to something on the hosts profile! State\n\n*why* you'd like to stay with THEM. This will increase your chances, because the host will notice that you\n\nactually read their profile (go up 1 level in CS request hierarchy), and that you actually might be a good match,\n\nbecause you're interested in something about them.\n\nIf you can't find anything - don't ask them (in my opinion), because you will spend time with each other and there\n\nshould be something that made you chose that person to ask. If it's only \"because you live close to the LOTE\n\nvenue\", you will have to get inventive :)\n\nI get tons of requests saying \"I will be in Bern, this is what I like ...\". Aha, fair enough. But if someone mentions\n\nsomething that s/he thinks, we have in common or s/he is interested in sharing - chances go up exponentially :)\n\n", "created_at": "2015-12-21 11:44:49", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:29.579192", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1044, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 315.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20559, "user_id": 149, "topic_id": 4286, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Oh!</b>\n\nhow lovely! my very best regards to the country!\n\nEspecially: Mobile Media Centre in Kengali, Muru, Mt Kailas and the Indus river rafting tour.\n\nCatch ya, Mi\n\n", "created_at": "2015-04-15 22:08:53", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:54.491716", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 36, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32372, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 4918, "post_number": 26, "raw": "<b>Regarding \"landing pages\"</b>\n\n&gt;\u00a0Why don't we do a\u00a0real\u00a0alternative landing page (linking to the relevant pages: how to participate, challenges etc.) - See more at: https://edgeryders.eu/en/comment/22790#comment-22790\n\nGets right to the heart of the matter because a \"landing page\" has to be less like the frontispiece of a publication and more like a well-designed rail or air terminal where you, who are in a hurry and who has never been there before, can <em>efficiently</em> get to your destination as quickly as you wish. \u00a0Of course there are compromises because we don't want to put everything right there to the point that it is nothing but lists devoid of aethetics. \u00a0\n\nIn all my 30\u00a0years in online networking, even with all the massive developments in visual and audio media, <em>speed</em> is still the most important thing. \u00a0More people use Facebook or Twitter to come to our site(s)? \u00a0Then it is even more true that whatever drove them here must fulfill for them their intention <em>on their first visit</em>. \u00a0One extra click could be, and often is, the thing that is just one task too many for someone on the move.\n\nSo make it look good and label it so that one cannot mistake where one is, and make it useful right there.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-05-03 16:10:39", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:57.887879", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 247, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4627, "user_id": 2761, "topic_id": 4594, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<strong>Company Description: </strong>\u00a0We are a collaborative company which is regarded as a startup for a team of undergraduates at Zewail City University of science and technology. Our company aims to solve the problem of energy in Egypt through innovative solutions<strong>. </strong>Marketing has already started at the moment we have entered the competition and we are continuing our work to make the best startup in Egypt and lead the renaissance in the field of energy.\n\n<strong>Mission Statement</strong>: Our Company's mission is to offer innovative solutions for the problem of energy in Egypt. Smart Solar Panels is just one project of many other projects as Piezo electric speed bumps integrated with street lights.\u00a0 Smart Solar Panels is the first project for the company but not the last. Hopefully our projects will integrate together to form alternative solutions for energy problems in Egypt based on renewable energy engineering and smart technologies as image processing and embedded systems. The mission has started and hopefully within three years it will totally accomplished according to our timeline.\n\n<strong>The Team:\u00a0 </strong>Our Company is based on the shoulders of a team of youth all are undergraduates at Zewail City University of science and technology. We have a supervisor who is Professor <span>Mahmoud Abd-Elaty</span>.\n\nEach one of the team has a specific area of proficiency and all our projects are integrated collaboration between different fields. Our team is composed of renewable energy engineering students (identifying the problem and the solution), Nano Technology students (developing innovative solutions) , Material science students (develop special materials when needed) and space-communication engineering students(embedded systems and technological aspects). We work together in a collaborative way in order to accomplish our mission as soon as possible. \u00a0\n\n<strong>Market Summary (review):</strong> Our Company is regarded as an initiator in its field as the field of renewable energy technology has not yet entered Egypt. There are some companies selling imported solar panels, however these companies are not competitors as the field we deal with is totally different and our work is built over their work. Therefore it is a perfect chance to initiate the market and to lead it easily. The market demands our existence due to the increasingly growing energy problem. So our existence is determined and our market is being shaped.\n\n<strong>Project Idea (over view): </strong>for full description for the project move to project section. Our project simply is a solar tracking system based on image processing. This technology enables the tracking system to move with the sun and maximize the amount of light energy utilized. Calculations predict that this tracking system can duplicate the product of any solar panel; however it does nothing with the efficiency of the panel itself. <strong>The first stage</strong> of the project is to sell the tracking system units and maintain them<strong>.\u00a0 The second stage</strong> which is the main project is to make and produce smart panels with integrated tracking system in it. The second stage duplicates the profit and increases the number of consuming clients. The tracking system is composed mainly from a camera for image processing, a microcontroller for calibration and doing calculations and 6 degrees of freedom stands. <span>See photos in the prototype section.</span>\n\nOne camera and one microcontroller can be used for thousands of solar panels. So this fact minimizes the cost, and also facilitates the maintenance. <span>See advantages of the project section.</span>\n\n<strong><span>For details please refer to the Project section.</span></strong>\n\n<strong>Competition</strong>: Our Company will initiate the market, so we do not have competitors initially, however we are ready with other ideas and projects that can make us take the lead of the Egyptian market in managing energy technology. As piezo electric speed bumps. This project is our next step it can allow us to illuminate all the Egyptian streets with no cost and we can also rebuilt our ways and streets based on our technologies.\n\n<strong>Goals and Objectives</strong>: Our target is to fulfill our mission while leading the Egyptian market. We target for the first year to establish the company and collect the fund needed for the second stage of the project. We also planned to collaborate with the Egyptian government in establishing the first four solar power stations in Egypt nest year. For the second year we aim to build our own smart panels and invade the Egyptian market. By the end of the second year, hopefully we will become the most well-established Egyptian Company in the field of managing energy. Then, we target exporting our products to Arab countries then to the whole world.\n\n<strong>Financial Plan: </strong>The plan starts when we have enrolled in the competition. Our company is looking for an investor to support our Company. We offer a deal for a five years contract which states that:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>First working year: Neither the company nor the investor will have profit. The profit gained will be used to establish the second stage of the project.</li>\n\n<li>Second working year: 70% of the profit will be distributed among the investor and the company by the ratio 50% and 50% respectively. The other 30% of the profit will be used to extend the limits of our reaching area.</li>\n\n<li>Third working year: 85% of profit will be distributed among the investor and the company by the ratio 35% and 65% respectively. The other 15% will be used as investments in any other field to guarantee the stability of the company in case of appearance of any competitors.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Fourth working year: 90% of profit will be distributed among the investor and the company by the ratio 40% and 60% respectively. The other 10% will be used as investments in any other field to guarantee the stability of the company.</li>\n\n<li>Fifth working year: 95% of profit will be distributed among the investor and the company by the ratio 50% and 50% respectively. The other 5% will be used as investments in any other field to guarantee the stability of the company.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nAfter the fifth year the contract will be no longer working and we will be able to make a new contract based on the company's situation in the market.\n\nIn case of absence of investors, we shall ask for support of Zewail city which supports innovative projects, Nile University and many other Organizations that support the scientific renaissance. \u00a0\n\nA Chinese University <span>has already</span> offered our company to travel to china the last two weeks in August to introduce our project<span>(Certified).</span> However, we hope we will be able to apply our project in Egypt and for the sake of the Egyptians with our own supplies.\n\n\u00a0 <strong>Resource Requirements: </strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Personnel: </strong>We need to support our team with financial youth experts. We need media experts. However All our team has already studied entrepreneurship. We need youth enthusiastic members to support our team.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Technology: </strong>We need to decrease the size the module as small as possible with the least cost. Therefore the progressing technology and Nano-technology will be very necessary and helpful.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Finances: </strong>We need an initiation fund of about 50 000 L.E to establish the company, Produce the first 50 modules and initiate the media campaign. For the second stage of the project we need about 150 000 L.E to produce our smart solar panel modules. Hopefully, the first stage will support the second stage with fund but we still need fund to have a strong start.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Risks and Rewards: </strong>\n\n<strong>Risks, </strong>Other companies may invade the Egyptian market and compete with us for the same targeted segment of clients. The response of the Egyptian market is not guaranteed, in other words we cannot assure the acceptance of our market for our products. Also the continuous fund is not guaranteed for a long interval of time.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n<strong>Rewards: </strong>\u00a0The first reward is acceptance of ASTF for our project. The market is really rewarding as we will build and shape it through our performance. The project has the chance to win more than one reward through ASTF, Egyptian Inventors Competition, Space international solar power competition and the prize of the best project in the annual conference held at Zewail city. The project is also rewarded by the interest of the Chinese university and the acceptance of the international professors as Dr.Abd-ElAty. Hopefully, the near future carries more rewards for our efforts.\n\n<strong>Key Issues and Decisions:</strong> As we are moving on in our project many issues face us, however we manage to solve them all. Some issues are technical, financial or even the time to do the tasks. Until now we managed to move over all the obstacles that have faced us. We are expecting to face some financial issues so we start to put alternative solutions in case we have not found the suitable investor. We have started in raising fund for the project in Zewail city and after the competition we will search for some sponsors. We plan to enter different competitions with this project in order to raise fund through their prizes. Our team starts to give workshops and courses to other students to introduce renewable energy for them. This is another way to raise fund. Part of our group starts freelancing to support the project. We do tasks for companies or associations in return of some money and rewards. We believe that money is the smallest obstacle that can hinder our ambition.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-26 13:07:33", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:26.487490", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1696, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 41.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3878], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1771, "user_id": 93, "topic_id": 1738, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\u00a0\n\nHi all,\n\na week ago I launched <a href=\"http://opinionage.com/\"><span>Opinionage.com</span></a>\u00a0(public beta) which is an open, web, social platform.

It probably differs by (sub)culture - but those are things that transport the vibe of a project quite strongly for me.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-08-02 20:38:45", "updated_at": "2017-08-02 20:38:45", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 118, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 2.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [24324], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19807, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1289, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>To show up or not to show up</b>\n\nKevin, you make many interesting points (no surprise, you have been thinking about this stuff quite a lot!) but not the one I am most curious about.

Tunisians, Egyptians and possibly Libyans are probably very proud of their outstanding achievements. \u00a0But if I were a Western activist of that movement, I think I would be quite frustrated right now.

They began to cover more grounds and soon, traveled to other affected areas to build temporary toilets. </em>\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5fb5b1511a9dbacf630381c2047270c6360866e4.jpg\" width=\"472\" height=\"315\"><br>\n\n<strong>Growing In Team and Efforts</strong>\n\n\u201cOur team started to function autonomously and we welcomed people willing to participate in it. We had started with 4000 rupees but now, we are able to supply toilet pans in hundreds to various affected areas. Even if all of us cannot go to all places, we send one of our volunteers where s/he trains the people to build toilets and then, move on to another place.\u201d\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/627ba06bd5e07f90a0f31cd26602e95017fd4347.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\"><br>\n\n\u201cDhading, Sindhuplachowk, Helambu, Dolakha\u2026 and then we started to distribute mosquito nets as well. We got this idea because one of the volunteers complained about mosquito bites while traveling in relief work, so we thought if we are suffering so much, so must the local people also. Everything we did, we did it out of utter compassion.\n\n\u201cIt has been so many weeks but still our volunteers are working with such motivation, without any rest.\u201d\n\n<strong>Longer Term Planning</strong>\n\n\u201cRelief efforts have started to shift to building temporary shelters. Along with it, one will have to start thinking about permanent toilets. Monsoon is soon approaching so we are actually working on a portable toilet design. We tried with bamboo, which is cheap but it takes longer time and is more labor-intensive. We are also researching on what materials can be used for this.\n\n\u201cOur volunteers are all college going students so once their colleges start, they will have to go back to studying. I will also go back to my own little world. But until we have volunteers with us, we will continue to do our work no matter if it is small scale, but we will do it properly.\n\n\u201cThis can also be implemented by other teams. I can generate funds for such initiatives.\u201d\n\n<strong>Learning from Volunteers and Villagers</strong>\n\n\u201cI learnt a lot from my volunteers. After Bhaktapur, I did not even have to go to the field. I would just go, pose for a photo, and post it on social media. Take all the credit and compliments! <em>(laughs)</em> But the volunteers never got angry. I do not know why. I mean, they were never discouraged. I did not have to do anything. I worked a little bit in Dhading, and almost fainted.\n\n\u201cBecause of them, I got so much extra time. So I started visiting camps. People had so many questions, \u201cWhy did this have to happen to us? Such fate!\u201d and I would have no answers for them. While they cried, I would just sit by their side. I started to listen to them. This gave them so much encouragement. From outside, we judged people living in camps were all in trauma but they are much stronger than us. People from here go there with two packets of Wai Wai (instant noodles) and they will feed us locally bred chicken <em>(smiles)</em>.\n\n\u201cOf course, this was a practice of giving. Yet, whenever someone asks if they can take their photos, they haven\u2019t forgotten to smile.\u201d\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6bc0bd22b71b4bfac2147a96d44125f67b0fa91a.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"470\"><br>\n\n\u201cI see so much of strength in their vulnerability.\u201d\n\n<strong>Toys in Tudikhel</strong>\n\n\u201cIn next phase, I went to Tudikhel in the Santa Claus costume with a lot of toys. Something happened there that I will never be able to forget. I met an 8 years old child who got a plastic house toy. He said, \u201cWhat if my house got destroyed, I have this small house.\u201d He started imagining his family in that house. I told his parents that your child\u2019s imagination is broader than your harsh reality so nurture this. The parents were inspired by their child.\u201d\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/901b68ca274cab2553d246e2d09d3c24b2a66de4.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\"><br>\n\n\u201cSo, I just went about in the camps giving people strength.\u201d\n\n<strong>Locally Sensible and Environmentally Friendly Initiatives</strong>\n\n\u201cI never went in any relief effort work where you take packets of junk food and mineral bottles of water. I always requested others to not send these things. While working in sustainability and reconstruction, we cannot continue giving unhealthy food. We are making our villagers dependent and unhealthy.\n\n\u201cInitially, it was ok \u2013 immediately, whatever was required was done. But now, it should not be that case. So, with our temporary toilet as well, wherever we go, we promote vegetable gardens. Imagine, rice and tomato chutney \u2013 it is so delicious! There is a big difference in waiting in the line to eat instant noodles and eating food that is locally grown. This can also be an alternative therapy since it distracts one\u2019s mind from the devastation and also brings one closer to nature.\u201d\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/61b1747e6ae07c23ad841d7e2f354b2552523879.jpg\" width=\"281\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\n\u201cSo I am also meeting experts to figure out about seeds, condition, and such. Our team had gone to Nuwakot and did an assessment. We are collecting pumpkin seeds, and tomato seeds. My favorite thing is beside every toilet, a banana tree! It provides shade from heat, imagine elephants and monkeys <em>(laughs)</em>, and shade from rain as well. It also has so much nutritious values.\u201d\n\n<strong>Need for a Positive Social Disaster</strong>\n\n\u201cI feel like there is a need for a social disaster through a bigger earthquake where no one will die and no one\u2019s houses will crumble down but people\u2019s foundations based on jealousy, disharmony, and greed will crumble down. Even today, when we go to build toilets, there are people who refused to let us temporarily use their land to build toilets. Those barriers need to be broken down.\n\n\u201cBut there are other kinds of people as well, where landlords have waived rent, where people have provided space for people to live in. They have realized. But many have yet to realize and grasp this.\u201d\n\n<strong>Look</strong> <strong>Around With Wider Heart</strong>\n\n\u201cActually, nothing has happened. Kathmandu had to suffer perhaps only 5%. Villages have flattened because the houses were really old. We were not prepared at all. When the whole world is looking at us and sending us relief and prayers, at this exact moment, the world is suffering from so many other difficulties. So this prime time is not only about Nepal. Nepal became a space where collective prayer was possible and at this time, we should pray collectively and act wisely. We should heal the entire planet and not just Nepal. So, I never feel sad about this happening to Nepal. From the perspective of lives lost, it is a big devastation but from another side, it is just a reminder to shift our awareness.\n\n\u201cSo, I was about to leave and go away. But emails started to come, \u2018Milan dai, you have made so much impact\u2019, \u2018Milan dai, we need this, or that\u2019 so I realized, I have yet to do something a bit more. If one phone call can provide a wheelchair to a spinal injury patient, or a Facebook status update can build someone\u2019s house, that is a blessing.\n\n\u201cI came to realize that I have not really done much. Now, I will start doing something! People say, give 100% but there is need for 1000%.\n\n\u201cEveryone can do something.\u201d\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/d/d403f6307d5ebec5a4a2755057448ade9e15a894.jpg\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\n<strong>Changing the System</strong>\n\n\u201cIf we blame government, we are learning to fail again. They were never transparent and they did not act responsibly from the beginning. So they never gave us the space to trust them. So, rather than supporting the same system, it is possible to change the system \u2013 at this hour. I do not engage in blaming and complaining about the government. I lose so much time and energy if I do that. I think about these things a lot.\n\n\u201cA lot of different organizations, and individuals are doing a lot, putting beside their egos as well. Many people may have put their interest forward but that is also ok.\n\n\u201cAfter our work, a lot of organizations came to work with but they wanted to put their banners. I told them they should be ashamed of such thing and that I do not care what their banners or the logos on their t-shirts say. With the time and money spent on printing the banner, one person\u2019s life can be saved.\n\n\u201cIt is not about who did what, but with what intention we did it. But I still feel like we haven\u2019t really done much!\u201d\n\n<strong>Changing the Attitude</strong>\n\n\u201cAt one point, there were a group of people who started this whole \\#gobackhomeindianmedia backlash thing. At that same time, an Indian pilot wrote to me saying he was amazed by our team work and wanted to help, not just send money but be there with you guys. So, I thought if I were to host him, this will be a great message. He came, and with the money that he had collected with his family and friends, he was able to help provide food, sanitary items, and toilets to around 200-300 households in Sindhupalchowk.\u201d\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/d/d4e1a26d5390a2876196f27d62e15de1b8f1b11a.jpg\" width=\"274\" height=\"206\"><br>\n\n\u201cI posted this. People then started to say, thank you. There is no Indian, or Chinese, or Americans, or Muslims, but only human beings. There is a big mine of generosity. This time, a lot of layers got peeled. I never said \u2018Indian media\u2019 but \u2018irresponsible media\u2019. So, if we are to shift our perspective\u2026 I am always hopeful.\u201d\n\n<em>Even after the questions in my checklist ran out, the conversation did not. We continued to talk for a while. Milan joked about how when he found out other people were building toilets where they were planning to, he got angry \u2013 we had a big laugh about this. We talked about the enthusiasm that we feel in the volunteers, possibilities of a community for such driven people who will remain separate yet combined in efforts, and I will leave you with a statement that Milan told me,</em>\n\n<strong>\u201cCompassion should not only be there when the earth shakes, but also when the earth spins.\u201d</strong>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<em>Photo credits: Milan Rai\u2019s Facebook Page (Used with Permission).

In other words, despite the material hardships of the period, it was not the weakest and most vulnerable who died in greater numbers, but the physically strong: what was most deadly about the collapse was not the disappearance of the means of staying alive, but the lack of ends for which to stay alive.\n\nEurope is not going through a Soviet-style collapse. (Or not yet: <a href=\"http://ppac.tumblr.com/post/41354009871/break-up-costs\">a report from UBS Investment Research</a> in September 2011 estimated the costs of a break-up of the Eurozone at 40-50% of weaker countries\u2019 GDP in the first year and 20-25% of the GDP of countries like Germany. For comparison, the total fall in GDP during the break-up of the USSR is estimated at 45%, spread over the years from 1989 to 1998.) The point I want to draw from Orlov, however, is that there is a powerful and complex interrelation between how we make a living and how we make sense of our lives. The consequences of an economic crisis can both lead to and be made worse by the crisis of meaning experienced by those whose lives it has derailed. If this is the case, however, perhaps it is also possible that action on the level of meaning might stem and even reverse the consequences, personal and social, of failing economic systems?\n\nThe figure of the \u2018graduate with no future\u2019, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/newsnight/paulmason/2011/02/twenty_reasons_why_its_kicking.html\">identified by Paul Mason</a>, has the advantage of youth, yet in other ways she resembles Orlov\u2019s successful middle-aged man. People are capable of enduring great hardship, so long as they can find meaning in their situation, but it is hard to find meaning in the hundredth rejection letter. The feeling of having done everything right and still got nowhere leads to a particular desperation. Against this background, the actions of those who might identify with Mason\u2019s description - whether as indignados in the squares of Spain, or as Edgeryders entering the corridors of Strasbourg and Brussels - are not least a search for meaning, for new frameworks in which to make sense of our lives when the promises that framed the labour market for our parents no longer ring true.\n\n Four years ago, in <a href=\"http://dougald.co.uk/writing/dougald_futureofunemployment_feb09.pdf\">\u2018The Future of Unemployment\u2019</a>, I suggested that it might be helpful to distinguish three types of need which, broadly speaking, we have looked to employment to provide. I want to return to this model as a way of structuring a search for examples of effective action on the level of meaning. Departing slightly from the original terms, I would summarise these types of need as follows:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>Economic/Practical</strong>: How do I pay the rent?</li>\n\n<li><strong>Social/Psychological</strong>: Who am I in the eyes of others?</li>\n\n<li><strong>Directional</strong>: What do I get out of bed for in the morning? And where do I see myself in the future?</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nThose who find it difficult to access the labour market are also likely to find answering these questions more difficult. The stories shared on the Edgeryders platform during 2011-12 illustrate the variety of ways in which young people find their access the labour market limited: not only through unemployment, but underemployment, casualisation and the prevalence of short-term contracts, the increasing cost of education in certain countries, the role of unpaid internships as a path to accessing certain industries. Where skills and qualifications have been acquired through formal education, many find themselves unable to secure work that makes use of these; where skills are acquired informally, the challenge is to represent these effectively to potential employers. Above all, the situation is defined by the interaction between two major processes: a long-term change in the structure of European labour markets, offering new entrants a poorer deal than had been the case for their parents\u2019 generation, has been exacerbated by the effects of the economic crisis that began in 2008.\n\nIf the situation of those struggling to access the labour market can be expressed in terms of the three types of need set out above, we might note that the last two belong primarily to the domain of meaning: our ability to answer them is closely related to our ability to make sense of our lives. Based on this, I suggest that we look for two stages in projects that might constitute effective action on the level of meaning: first, the ability to substitute for employment in providing social identity and a sense of direction; and, second, the potential for this to lead to new means of meeting practical needs.\n\nWith this structure in mind, I want to consider briefly a few examples which I think offer clues to what this may look like in practice.\n\n<strong>Centers for New Work</strong>: During the collapse in employment in the US auto industry in the early 1980s, the philosopher Frithjof Bergmann worked with employers, unions and community organisations in Flint, Michigan to create the <a href=\"http://www.context.org/iclib/ic37/bergmann/\">Center for New Work</a>. \u2018We are in the beginning of a great scarcity of jobs,\u2019 <a href=\"http://newworknewculture.com/sites/default/files/scan%201.pdf\">Bergmann argued</a>, \u2018but not of work.\u2019 Instead of making redundancies, he proposed that employers share out the remaining jobs on a rotating work schedule. Workers would alternate between extended periods in traditional industrial work and similar periods pursuing \u2018New Work\u2019. The latter included local production to meet practical needs, but also the right of everyone to spend a significant amount of their time pursuing a personally meaningful project.\n\n<strong>Access Space</strong>: In Sheffield, England - another post-industrial city, similarly hit by unemployment in the early 1980s - the artist James Wallbank and friends set up what has become <a href=\"http://www.access-space.org/\">the UK\u2019s longest-running free internet learning centre</a>. As <a href=\"http://www.nesta.org.uk/news_and_features/britains_new_radicals/access_space\">described by NESTA</a>, \u2018The centre brings together old computers and new open source software to create a radical, sustainable response to industrial decline and social dislocation.\u2019 In conversation, Wallbank has emphasised to me the importance of the social and directional role of participation at Access Space: for those who have been long-term unemployed, the change in the shape of their lives on becoming a regular participant is often huge; by comparison, the change from being a regular participant to entering employment is relatively small. From my own observation, another key aspect of the Access Space model is the power of its insistence on self-referral: this means that participants are drawn from a range of social and economic backgrounds, rather than exclusively from a target group identified by its deprivation. This means that participation at the centre provides an alternative to - rather than a reinforcement of - a negative social identification.\n\n<strong>West Norwood Feast</strong>: In 2010-11, <a href=\"http://spacemakers.info/\">the agency I founded</a> led a project to co-create <a href=\"http://westnorwoodfeast.com/about\">a community-owned and -run street market</a> in south London. This experience reaffirmed my sense of the power of what people can do when they come together to work on something that matters to them. In particular, talking to those involved, I was struck by how positively many of them experienced using their skills as part of the Feast, when compared to their experience in regular employment. Might it be that work that takes place outside of employment is more likely to be experienced as meaningful? And, if so, why? Several possible answers exist. The psychologist Edward Deci famously demonstrated that <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GqJiaL6w1q-FR4VpC6qhX5pfdu72s48H\">being paid for a task tends to decrease our intrinsic motivation</a>, a phenomenon he explains in terms of the shift of the \u2018locus of motivation\u2019. Meanwhile, as I argued in <a href=\"http://dougald.co.uk/writing/dougald_spacehackers_dec10.pdf\">\u2018The Future We Deserve\u2019</a>, the logic of maximising productivity has made industrial-era employment an unprecedentedly anti-social form of work. More practically, though, are there ways we can build a better relationship between meaningful work and our ability to pay the rent?\n\n<strong>House concerts</strong>: The music industry has been through huge disruption since the 1990s, not least as a result of the rise of filesharing. The solo bass player <a href=\"http://twitter.com/solobasssteve\">Steve Lawson</a> is an example of an independent musician who has spent his career developing new models for making a living and documenting the realities of this on his blog. He sells <a href=\"http://music.stevelawson.net/\">downloads of his albums</a> on a pay-what-you-want basis and makes \u2018house concert\u2019 tours on which he plays in the front rooms of fans, many of whom have first met him online. Reading his accounts of this, two things are clear: first, that these models, drawing on the strengths of networked technologies, allow for <a href=\"http://www.stevelawson.net/2009/03/celebrity-20-fame-in-a-conversation-economy/\">a far more meaningful relationship</a> with his audience than was possible in the music industry of the pre-Napster era; and, second, that house concerts also <a href=\"http://www.stevelawson.net/2009/02/real-life-touring-a-social-media-fuelled-tale/\">make touring economically viable</a> for independent musicians in a way that was harder when playing traditional venues. Are there other areas in which socially-embedded grassroots economies can thrive where high-overhead conventional economies struggle? (For another take on the potential of low-overhead economic models, see Kevin Carson\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Homebrew-Industrial-Revolution-Low-Overhead-Manifesto/dp/1439266999\">The Homebrew Industrial Revolution</a>.)\n\n<strong>The Unmonastery</strong>: One of the projects to emerge from the first phase of Edgeryders was a proposal for something called an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/unmonastery\">Unmonastery</a>: \u2018a creative refuge bound to host problem solvers and change makers, who together work to solve (g)local problems, in exchange for board and lodging.\u2019 At present, this proposal is being developed by a group that met through the Living on the Edge events in 2012. The initial response suggests that young people are willing to take a step down in their material expectations, if this is balanced by sufficient security and autonomy to pursue work which they believe matters. The challenge will be to develop a vehicle for this willingness which is capable of \u2018interfacing\u2019 with existing institutions and accessing resources, which can achieve a reasonable degree of stability, and which does not devolve into a mechanism for exploitation. Daunting as this sounds, it is likely that we will see more experiments along these lines in Europe in the years ahead. (<a href=\"http://www.edventurefrome.org/\">Edventure: Frome</a>, which launched in October 2012, has parallels to the Unmonastery model, although framed in educational terms.)\n\nFive years into the current crisis, the default future for much of Europe is a world of longer hours and lower wages. Economic regeneration as we have known it could hardly keep up with the social costs of industrial decline, even during periods of sustained growth. That economic collapse can lead into and become entrenched by a collapse of meaning is not just a post-Soviet story, but one that can be traced in many of Europe's former industrial regions, not least the areas of South Yorkshire where I once worked as a journalist.\n\nThe scale and harshness of those realities makes me hesitate: I do not want to overstate the case for the examples I have discussed here. Yet I would suggest that they may offer clues, at least, towards another kind of regeneration: what might be called a \u2018regeneration of meaning\u2019. There is no guarantee that this will happen, nor that, if it does, it will take the kind of form we would wish to see. However, for those who consider the possibility worth exploring, I have a few questions:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>What would it take for this to coalesce into something serious?</strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>How far along is it already?</strong> (Is it further than we/others assume, due to its illegibility?)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Where are the other examples that would build the case?</strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>What are the dangers?</strong> (For example, could the Unmonastery inadvertently become <a href=\"http://www.chiddingstone.kent.sch.uk/\">the workhouse</a> of the 21st century?)</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<em>Image credit: Listening to the Walls - Photo by Bembo Davies, Institute of non-toxic propaganda</em>", "created_at": "2016-04-01 09:06:06", "updated_at": "2018-05-26 08:16:31.518663", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2307, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 77.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [6570], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32944, "user_id": 1692, "topic_id": 2199, "post_number": 29, "raw": "<b>No problem!</b>\n\nHi Alberto no problem you did it quite well!\n\n", "created_at": "2013-12-13 16:02:21", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:00.779472", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 15, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [32937], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27518, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4433, "post_number": 12, "raw": "<b>Fact checking</b>\n\nThanks, <a href=\"/u/sammuirhead\">@SamMuirhead</a>, liking and respect are heartily reciprocated.\n\nIn my previous comment I claim Arthur has been misrepresenting the issue; made an argument for that claim; and backed it with evidence. So that's misrepresentation. The personal insults are there at the time of writing this (\"fraudulent\", \"divisive\", \"incompetent\".

He decided to leave the company over a month ago. The rest of us cannot but respect his decision and move on. As we do so, we go public with our main moves (new projects, new people etc.), as we always did, for transparency. That's all. He seems to imply we excluded him, but that, as I wrote, is a misrepresentation. So, what constructive discussion do you think we should have? A possibility would be to ignore the bad blood and ask Patrick about his interests and skills, and maybe help him direct his work to the greater good. Arthur? He removed himself from the picture, not much construction to be done there.\n\nThat leaves the \"manipulative\" part. Yes, I am trying to be above anger and pettiness. Is that bad? What should I do, put up a fist fight? Not to put too fine a point on it, <em>I too</em> have been accused on fraud and incompetence. You did not like Patrick's tough response; you do not like my softer one. What would you suggest as an appropriate reaction to allegations you have committed a criminal offense? It's not a sarcastic question, I really fail to understand. And: do you not think your own gut reaction should have been to ask <em>everyone</em> to stand down and go back to civil interaction?\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-23 11:02:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:31.988060", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 359, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 6.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [27478], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12402, "user_id": 10, "topic_id": 1268, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Nurturing Development</b>\n\nHey Tiago!\n\nWhat a great ryde man!

This starts with bringing people together, creating the right space and atmosphere for the work, then moderating the process and following up on the results afterwards. In most cases, this work is unpaid and based on mere enthusiasm. In order to keep the community manager's motivation alive, it is important that a) the community manager has a clear mandate and b) that the community agress on a specific compensation for this work. I have seen many projects that started with a lot of energy, which just evaporated after a while because there was not enough support for the facilitator. Having said that, I think it is really key to create a common memorandum of understanding, which should include a description of tasks and responsibilities, the common goals and maybe also the life cycle of the collaborative endeavour.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-03-23 16:24:16", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:29.582009", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 208, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [24202], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8247, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4879, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Ping consortium agreement</b>\n\n<a href=\"/u/melancon\">@melancon</a>, I am afraid we are running out of time here.\u00a0\n\nAlso: should we touch base soon?\n\n", "created_at": "2015-12-10 15:50:19", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:47.790648", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 32, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27112, "user_id": 2006, "topic_id": 2723, "post_number": 12, "raw": "@Noemi that sounds great. @Matthias my skype handle is - georgemamadashvili and I'll be available on that time, later as well.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-14 19:26:15", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:29.933753", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 23, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [26398], "is_liked_by": [1861], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10902, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 2942, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Use the tool of your choice</b>\n\nI had similar experiences with WEFT under Linux, even when running it inside VirtualBox.

However, within the address he provided us with words of wisdom that we must look to once again, words that provide us a formula we can follow for job creation through the changes created by the move to Open Government.\n\nI blogged, not long ago, that the <a href=\"http://govinthelab.com/the-roi-of-open-government-data-new-jobs/\" rel=\"external nofollow\" target=\"new\"><u><font color=\"#0066cc\">return on investment (ROI) of open government data was job creation</font></u></a>. This article came as a result of listening to Carolyn Lawson, Technology Services Governance Division, State of California, discuss the <a href=\"http://gov20.govfresh.com/apps-for-california-winners-feature-innnovative-mashups-of-open-government-data/\" rel=\"external nofollow\" target=\"new\"><u><font color=\"#0066cc\">Apps for Californians contest</font></u></a> that took place earlier in 2010. From this contest 5 winners were selected and 5 companies were created or extended. Jobs were created.\n\nYou may be asking yourself a few questions.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><em>What is open government data?</em> Government agencies have data on budgets, transit systems, housing, education, and much, much, more. This data, minus anything that is privacy or legally restricted, is open government data.</li>\n\n<li><em>What are application contests like Apps for Californians?</em> Government entities are opening up data and are looking to the private sector to leverage this data to create value-added applications. These contest reward offer incentives to the private sector to use this data in return for monetary rewards, marketing, and/or developer assistance.</li>\n\n<li><em>Is this a good use of taxpayer money?</em> We'll explore that in this article and you can decide.</li>\n\n</ul>As 2010 began California was not seen as a leader in terms of open government data. In January the project kicked off to change this, resulting in the <a href=\"http://www.ca.gov/appsforcalifornians/\" rel=\"external nofollow\" target=\"new\"><u><font color=\"#0066cc\">Apps for Californians</font></u></a> contest that was launched in June of 2010. Unfortunately, as is often the case, Carolyn had responsibility for getting the job done but did not have the resources, the budget, or the authority required to mandate any other teams priorities. How did she get the project done?\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><em>An internal group that owned a lot of data was brought into the project.</em> The team had a great deal of experience providing data to other teams in California government and they were brought on board in January, months ahead of the June deadline.</li>\n\n<li><em>They sought out partners in the private sector who had experience with managing data-focused communities.</em> Unfortunately, with no money to offer there was little interest with the exception of <a href=\"http://www.programmableweb.com/\" rel=\"external nofollow\" target=\"new\"><u><font color=\"#0066cc\">ProgrammableWeb</font></u></a>. Programmableweb went above and beyond in terms of providing the necessary infrastructure that Carolyn was looking for, of course, but they also provided guidance about the world of data and mash-ups and became a valued partner in the process.</li>\n\n<li><em>Outreach: A volunteer group of California webmasters was made aware of the project.</em> This group, in existence since 2006, meets regularly to discuss software, train each other on new technologies, and to support each other through difficult projects. Members of this volunteer team worked overtime on multiple occasions to make the contest a reality.</li>\n\n<li><em>The focus of the contest was not what people could do for government; instead, it was for the people. </em>The name,<strong> Apps for Californians</strong> reflected this very simple, yet important, change in focus. This focus was critical as California was unable to provide any monetary prizes. Instead, the developers participating were involved because the contest could provide economic value to the developers themselves.</li>\n\n</ul>Programmableweb evaluated the applications that were submitted, doing the bulk of the heavy lifting once the contest began. The evaluation process is time consuming, ensuring the applications are doing the job advertised and ensuring that nothing being done violated any copyrights. 5 winners were chosen; you can read more about them on the <a href=\"http://www.ca.gov/appsforcalifornians/\" rel=\"external nofollow\" target=\"new\"><u><font color=\"#0066cc\">California web site</font></u></a>. However, the economic gains achieved are clear and were demonstrated in these ways:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><em>Marketing of capabilities:</em> A couple of companies took the opportunity to build useful applications to demonstrate their ability to work with real data and to win additional business. Citizens and California Government won, the businesses invested little and clearly won as well.</li>\n\n<li><em>New businesses created:</em> Seeing opportunities to create powerful new mash-ups some new businesses were formed. While the long-term value of these businesses is yet to be demonstrated jobs have been created already.</li>\n\n</ul>Jobs and new market opportunities were clearly created. However, have any efficiency been created as a result? Theoretically yes, but it is too early to provide any true assessment of publishing this information in an open format.\n\nWhile the results from this one contest are promising, the full value is far from being achieved. In order to fully realize benefits from open data government must finally go \"all in\" and stop putting out mandates that lack economic goal-oriented focus. In California, as we discussed, these wins came as a result of a mandate to open up data, not to create jobs and not to reduce operating costs. If a true Open Government Office were established at the state level we could go far further. The office must:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><em>Have clear goals in terms of jobs created and operating costs reductions.</em></li>\n\n<li><em>Must be budgeted and staffed. </em> Today's e-services office, which ran this, is not a formal organization. It is given mandates but not authority or budget.</li>\n\n<li><em>Establish strategic partnerships INSIDE and OUTSIDE of government.</em> Partnering with the private sector, with Higher Education, and with other agencies to meet its goals will increase cooperation, collaboration, and bring all of us to a focus on what matters now: job creation.</li>\n\n</ul>Why should we add more structure to government? Today no one is really responsible for maintaining sites like the California Open Government Data site. That volunteer group of webmasters, often working overtime so as to not impact their \"day jobs\" gets it done because they care, not because it is their job. We can only count on the passion and caring of government employees for so long. Ultimately, politicians must put focus on ensuring these efforts continue and thrive, so we the public can reap the benefits. Otherwise, those working \"for the people\" may simply choose, or be forced, to go do something else.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-11 16:53:19", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:04.724667", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1282, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 26.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21323, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2352, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>A good place to start...</b>\n\n\u2026 is [this thread](/t/2334).

Which didn't change the fact that even if they had theoretically more time to spend on approaching me as a patient, they would mostly limit their help to examination and writing a prescription. Rarely they bother talking to me and try to figure out the reasons for the problem. It happened a lot with dermatologists, who basically just give you a prescription for some external treatment, very expensive, and ask you to try it out. None of their recommendations ever helped me.\u00a0\n\nLast times were absurd to an extent that the doctor wouldn't even tell me what he thinks is wrong until I asked - and then the questions about medication followed, with an ironic response: oh, so you're interested in drugs?\u00a0\n\nI don't know what these doctors are actually frustrated with. I guess an inhumane amount of patients to see every day might be one of the reasons. Still, I would suggest there is a huge lack of empathy training during their studies and work, and maybe this is why they're incapable of approaching their patients in a more personal, compassionate manner.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-08-30 17:55:50", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:10.894066", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 239, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [11945], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19639, "user_id": 3074, "topic_id": 5349, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Hi,\u00a0\n\nI already posted it after the kick-off in the googe drive file, section Opencare Admin.\n\nYou can also download it from here:\u00a0<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/grants_manual/hi/oa_pilot/h2020-hi-oa-data-mgt_en.pdf\">https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/grants_manual/hi/oa_pilot/h2020-hi-oa-data-mgt_en.pdf</a>\n\n", "created_at": "2016-03-21 08:43:43", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:49.429608", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 70, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29006, "user_id": 2095, "topic_id": 3004, "post_number": 21, "raw": "<b>i want to check it out</b>\n\n<span>i did not know about arkab eih? how do i download it on our mobile to check it out?</span>\n\n", "created_at": "2014-05-26 16:51:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:39.622434", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 43, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [28393], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5479, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 5446, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<span>After discussing with colleagues and community members in Edgeryders, I propose we \u201czoom in\u201d from care in general to three specific instances.

Plus qu\u2019un toit elle offre \u00e0 ses habitants une structure physique et sociale o\u00f9 s\u2019\u00e9panouir. De plus elle a le m\u00e9rite de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ces deux probl\u00e8mes fondamentaux \u00e0 Bruxelles. Les activit\u00e9s au rez-de-chauss\u00e9e cr\u00e9ent une vie de quartier \u00e9vitant toute ghetto\u00efsation.\n\nLes ateliers permettent aux habitants d\u2019apprendre, d\u00e9velopper ou partager leurs connaissances et leur savoir-faire. Bien que la vie dans une communaut\u00e9 telle que celle du \u00ab123\u00bb peut devenir \u00e9prouvante par moments, elle permet d\u2019\u00e9viter l\u2019isolement des habitants les plus vuln\u00e9rables et permet \u00e0 ceux qui ne se retrouvent pas dans les solutions conventionnelles un moyen d'explorer de nouvelles pistes pour l'habiter en ville. Une m\u00e9diation permanente des conflits qui apparaissent inexorablement dans une communaut\u00e9 aussi importante est n\u00e9cessaire et figure parmi les conditions indispensables de r\u00e9ussite de ce genre d'exp\u00e9rience. Ainsi ces b\u00e9n\u00e9fices se font au co\u00fbt d\u2019une gestion rigoureuse et d\u2019une \u00e9nergie consid\u00e9rable \u00e0 d\u00e9ployer quotidiennement par les habitants pour la communaut\u00e9. Nous avons r\u00e9alis\u00e9 \u00e0 quel point l\u2019inclusion des usagers d'un habitat est importante pour r\u00e9ussir un projet de logement, Le mouvement semble n\u00e9anmoins en marche et l\u2019association logements123 wonen a commence \u00e0 transposer l\u2019exp\u00e9rience \u00e0 d\u2019autres batiments avec d\u2019autres habitants.\n\nCeci en tirant parti des le\u00e7ons apprises au 123, ainsi qu\u2019au tagawa et au G\u00e9su. Malgr\u00e9 le statut temporaire et incertain de l\u2019occupation, il semblerait que plus que le b\u00e9ton du b\u00e2timent, ce sont les habitants qui portent le projet du \u00ab123\u00bb. \u00ab(\u2026) les logements alternatifs ne sont pas abordables parce que l\u2019ensemble des exigences qui y sont li\u00e9es ne correspondent ni aux r\u00e9alit\u00e9s qu\u2019ils vivent, ni \u00e0 leurs moyens (co\u00fbt des mat\u00e9riaux, acc\u00e8s aux primes, confrontation aux normes de salubrit\u00e9, s\u00e9curit\u00e9, urbanisme\u2026). Ce que les plus pauvres construisent au quotidien, ce sont des alternatives au logement, pour se garantir un habitat qui soit abordable financi\u00e8rement et dont ils auront la maitrise\u00bb 57 ainsi que les l\u2019importance des gains de la mutualisation de fonctions communes. Ces gains ne se chiffrent pas qu\u2019en m\u00e8tres carr\u00e9s, mais surtout en contacts sociaux quotidiens, un partage des ressources et une \u00e9conomie en \u00e9nergie. Ce mod\u00e8le n\u2019est n\u00e9anmoins pas sans limitations. On peut craindre avec l\u2019accroissement de la popularit\u00e9 du projet une gentrification des habitants. Aussi la liste d\u2019attente pour trouver une place, m\u00eame si moins longue que pour un logement social est l\u00e0 pour rappeler que l\u2019occupation d\u2019un seul b\u00e2timent n\u2019est pas une solution exhaustive au manque de logement. La nature urgente de la question du logement \u00e0 Bruxelles demande un engagement des pouvoirs public dans une politique de favorisation de telles initiatives.\n\nCeci en adaptant le cadre l\u00e9gal et en informant les propri\u00e9taires sur les avantages de\u00a0telles initiatives. Ce travail nous permet de d\u00e9gager trois points primordiaux pour le mise en place r\u00e9ussie de ce genre d'initiative:\n\n<strong>- L'implication active et quotidienne des habitants\u00a0dans un projet commun.</strong>\n\n<strong>- La collaboration et l'information des propri\u00e9taires\u00a0de b\u00e2timents vides</strong>\n\n<strong>- La permissivit\u00e9 ou l'encadrement par les authorit\u00e9s.\"</strong>\n\nYou can find the complete publication here: www.academia.edu/16771654/LE_DROIT_\u00e0_LHABITAT_PAR_LOCCUPATION\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">123 was a previously\u00a0office building occupied by the French community which had been vacant for 15 years. Groups of squatters moved in and made a deal with the owner to run different workshops - bike fixing, woodwork, IT etc.</h3>\n\nSome interesting facts from his paper:\n\n-social housing in Bxl is much lower, 7 % compared to the 27% in the Netherlands\n\n-7 % of houses totally empty\n\n-1 000 000 sq metres of unused office space: 40% of empty offices have been empty for 7 years\n\nFrom squatting to a participatory process -\u00a0 a public owned space (Community Francais) but community managed: from refugees to Irish artists to Flemish doctor students. Half the people (of 60) don't have any revenues, and everyone contributes a little - from 60 eur a month to approx. 150.\u00a0\u00a0In Belgium it is possible to have a temporary legal occupation for an office, so you can live in an office space!\n\nIt's an office building, which means people can change the layout easily. This makes it an interesting testcase for architects that are experimenting with commun space. The big difference between buildings for profit and the testcase of 123:\n\nProfit building is praised for being open while just having 7% of their space being used for community. 123 has almost 50% of community used space, but because of their 'illegal' status it isn't praised.\u00a0Loic showed a detailed distribution of the types of spaces - at each floor you'd have facilities, workshops, library + distribution of private and communal space. \u00a0Important detail: Stairs are used instead of working elevators as a social control mechanism.\u00a0\n\nLoic is trying to give more visibility to housing solutions - it's not easy, he says, and it's important to make good contact with the owner! \"First you squat, then you talk\" is his moto. He wants to continue researching these kinds of houses.

The account is driven by the need of the project to get a bird's eye view of the main trends unfolding in Egypt, boiled down to a degree of simplicity such that it enables cross-country comparisons within the time and budget constraints of FMG. This makes it impressionistic and sketchy. It will be checked against official policy documents.\u00a0<strong>Please do not quote until the process of collaborative editing is done.</strong>\u00a0</em>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Policy priorities and trends\u00a0</h3>\n\nEgypt runs on a hyper-Schumpeterian ideology. Entrepreneurship is seen as the silver bullet that will solve everything. Social problems will be solved by social entrepreneurship. There are even talks to teach entrepreneurship in schools, in the curriculum.\u00a0\n\nTreating entrepreneurship as the critical tool towards improving Egypt's overall social and economic health appears to be, according to interviewees, a logical move. Every year, 600,000 (CAPMAS, 2013) Egyptians join the labour market. The public sector is already bloated with more people than it can use, and cannot absorb but few of those young people. 70% of job creation is driven by the private sector; and private sector has its own labor needs, which are similar to those of most countries: more \"cream of the crop\" highly qualified people with specific skills that happen to be in need at this point in time, not so many middle-of-the-road graduates. Labour demand \u2013 supply matching and retraining policies can help a little, but it is already being done. That leaves new business as the most likely candidate for creating new jobs.\u00a0\n\nTwo labour policy asides (not directly relevant to the project, but useful as part of the background):\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Labour policies seem to be, in some cases, overengineered. A scheme that was reported to us is a scheme of demand-supply matching for apprenticeships and internships directed to boys and girls who are still in school, and therefore are _unqualified_. The thinking behind it is that having a summer job can help youth develop personal and relational skills that will be useful when applying for, or holding, a job. But is there really any need to match schoolboys with farms, and paying the overhead cost of the matching structure?</li>\n\n<li>Entrepreneurship policies have reached the point where they risk distorting the incentives for the budding entrepreneurs. One of the interviewees reported that some young, obviously smart people perceive it as viable to just go from competition to competition, from grant to grant, and stop business when the grant or award dries up.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nThe Egyptian government appears to be working with the main stakeholders to build an ecosystem conducive to entrepreneurs reaching their full potential. Many efforts are directed towards building funnels that find entrepreneurial ideas and bring them to market in the form of startups. We heard of several startup programs (Injaz <strong>Startup Incubator Programme</strong>, Misr el-Kheir's <strong>Gesr Programme</strong>, Nile University's <strong>NU100</strong>\u00a0<strong>competition</strong>). Microsoft offers online coaching for startuppers. The main tools in use seem to be competitions, mentoring, coaching, and incubators. Most of this effort focuses on nano-bio, ICT, greentech.\u00a0\n\nThere are many remaining challenges for the full potential of entrepreneurship to bear fruit. Specifically:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>the regulatory environment for new business is stiff and unfriendly.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>regulation on key areas pertaining to startups (patents, IPR, data protection, openness of public sector information) is still missing.</li>\n\n<li>university research is subpar.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>services for tech startups are expensive or missing. There are only two law firms serving startups; no accountants; few consultants on the specifics.</li>\n\n<li>angel investors are there, but they do not appear to be having a large impact.</li>\n\n<li>private sector companies get involved in entrepreneurship competitions, but they tend to recruit the smartest competitors rather than invest in their business.</li>\n\n<li>incubated firms struggle to move forward and scale.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nAs a consequence, the funnel is missing pieces both at the beginning (pre-idea) and at the end (second and third round, post-incubator). There are signals that the government is working on improving regulation to make Egypt more business-friendly, but some of the interviewees expected that this would not really accelerate until a parliament is elected.\n\nSocial entrepreneurship/social innovation is attracting attention, but it does not feature as prominently in Egyptian policy as it does in Europe. We know of one already active pipeline for social entrepreneurship (Misr el-Kheir), and of another one being considered. (Injaz). The active one, however, insists on \"high profitability\", so that the term \"social\" becomes a bit diluted (and could even be interpreted as a constraint). The Egyptian legal system does not have a specific legal form designed for social entrepreneurs, like the CIC in the UK and the cooperativa sociale in Italy.\u00a0\n\nThe Egyptian government is very active and has obvious delivery ability. This blessing comes with the risk of taking initiatives that crowd out existing (private- or third sector) initiatives in the country. Examples:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Telecenters (late 90s initiative towards computer literacy and online access) could have been run by private entrepreneurs in the form, prevailing elsewhere, of Internet caf\u00e9s (of which the government could have subsidized some socially oriented, not-for-profit activities)</li>\n\n<li>Kenana Online (user-generate knowledge base in Arabic) is in a sense taking the place of Wikipedia.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nMaybe as a result of this, global knowledge-oriented, volunteer-based not for profit \u00a0initiative (Open Knowledge Foundation, Wikimedia/Wikipedia, OpenStreetMap) are not very visible in Egypt, and none of our interviewees quoted them.\u00a0\n\nThanks to the UNDP country office in Cairo, a community meeting was organised on June 4th 2015. Over 1,000 people registered, but \u2013 due to capacity issues \u2013 only 60 places were made available, and were allocated on a \"first come, first served\" basis. Many of the initiatives represented were at pre-testing phases; only 13 of them had been deployed, even on an experimental basis. The most interesting ones have been contacted for some follow-up.\n\nThe main finding from the meeting was the following: young changemakers in Egypt are deeply motivated, but report frustration in implementation. The lack of implementation skills was a reason often cited. This was reflected in the event itself, with many participants finding it difficult to come up with short, clear, written descriptions of their own initiatives. This issue was often mentioned in interviews with other partners. Nafham, an a crowdsourced educational platform, meets a lot of volunteers interested in contributing content to its platform. However, much of this effort is reportedly of low quality, and this slows down the growth of the user base.\u00a0\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">News from the grassroots scene</h3>\n\nThe Spot The Future project had revealed two main areas of interests for Egyptian changemakers. One is <strong>greentech</strong> (solar, water sanitation, waste recycling etc.), which is supposedly cared for by the fledgling ecosystem of policies directed towards entrepreneurship.\n\nThe other one is <strong>reclaiming and repurposing public spaces for the common good</strong>, with the <a href=\"/en/constructing-a-ring-road-exit-by-the-people-egypt\">Al-Mutamidiya ring road ramps story</a> being the most impressive example of self-organization we found so far. UNDP itself has been involved in this scene, with a successful initiative to have young people contribute to designing the renovation of a central street in Giza (the governor of Giza turned out to have urban planning background, which makes him a potential champion for these initiatives). This line of work does not appear to be part of the startup ecosystem.\n\nOther examples include the many coworking spaces that flourished in Egypt (many of which do not appear to have a viable business model, but they do signal a drive of youth to claim spaces), like Mesaha, Rasheed 22. Megawra and Cairo Hackerspace (<a href=\"/t/case-study-notes-from-cairo-work-in-progress/4512\">learn more</a>). Of these, at least the first one is fully grant-free, surviving on a very community oriented \"pay what you can\" model. The <a href=\"/en/future-makers-case-studies-adventures/draft-darb-al-labbanh-initiative\">Darb al-Labbanah initiative</a>, currently in its planning stages, strives to revitalise Historic Cairo by adaptively reusing long neglected properties as a hub for social enterprises and cultural businesses.\u00a0\n\nCairo is also home to <a href=\"http://clustercairo.org\">Cluster</a>, an urban planning studio that achieved international fame for doing work on informal settlements and \"tactical urbanism\" \u2013 another sign of societal interest in the matter and a reservoir of high-level technical expertise.\u00a0\n\nThere seems to be a space for a work that would\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Support Egyptian grassroots initiatives, taking care to maximize their employment-generation potential without altering their fundamental incentive-structure.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Rebrand these initiatives as social entrepreneurship. This would generate two advantages. One is to lend structure to these initiatives (enterprises should have a formal reflection on what they do: revenue model, partners and allies, governance structures... ) and, this way, increase their effectiveness, speed of development, replicability. The other advantage is to make them more legible to the authorities. This is needed as, in the post-revolution climate, spontaneous aggregations of citizens are at risk of being misinterpreted.</li>\n\n<li>The link to employment and social inclusion can be made via the need for these operations to go sustainable. When you have a space and need resources to maintain it, the logical thing to do is to use the space as a the platform for a service that you can sell. This seems to be happening in the Megawra case, which runs a daycare service for children, and could be encouraged. Interaction with the greentech scene could also be explored: Rasheed 22, for example, seems to have already quite strong ties with it. The link towards data can be made via citizen-built digital maps; maps have always been the weapon of choice of urban planners to organize their thought and communicate with local communities. The OpenStreetMap community could be mobilized to collaborate with the architects.</li>\n\n<li>Make the most of a highly positive cultural specificity of the Arab world in the context of social innovation: the Islam-mandated, highly structured system of making donations for the good of the community (zaqat) and respected, senior local leaders to act as trustees of those donations make fundraising, in a way, simpler than elsewhere. This was the social and economic structure underpinning the ring road ramps project in Al-Mutamidiya.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Three things we could do (provisional!)</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Run an inventory of initiatives around public spaces, and perhaps organize a small event to help this fledgling scene perceive itself as a movement, rather than an archipelago of isolated initiatives.</li>\n\n<li>Disseminate knowledge on working with geodata (conducive to asset mapping, thematic maps, coverage of dilapidated areas where the Google car does not go etc.)</li>\n\n<li>Collaborate with the entrepreneurship ecosystem (Misr El-Kheir is one obvious candidate) to encourage these projects to focus more on financial sustainability, inevitably creating employment as they get more successful. Perhaps a specific mentoring program could be considered.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Useful links to policy documents</h3>\n\nEgyptian government support for Entrepreneurship derives mostly from within the Ministry of Communications &amp; Information Technology (MCIT).

What are the five most pressing resilience-building priorities for your city?* (2000 characters) [Note: more RF links on resilience are <a href=\"http://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/blog/initiative/Resilience\">here</a>]</em>\n\nWe can use some of the <a href=\"/t/summary-challenges-matera/1126\">challenges</a> collected through the unMonastery workshops exercise in the spring?\n\nIt is inevitable to speak about the Sassi cave-dwellings, the historical neighbourhoods which were considered \"national shame\" in the 50's and then inscribed in the UNESCO World heritage list in 1993 as 1st \"cultural landscape\" site. The international expert Pietro Laureano, who wrote out the UNESCO bid, argued that what had to be preserved was the architectural practice functional to the building of the Sassi settlement <u><em>and</em></u><em> </em>to the maintanance of a sustainable micro-climate in a place of scarce resources. For Laureano, the Sassi are a matrix of sustainable techniques to collect water and manage light and heat which can be found all over the mediterranean, up to China. He is in the process of building an <a href=\"http://www.tkwb.org/web/?page_id=4&amp;language=it\">online database</a> for UNESCO which collects all the traditional knowledge (\"the deepest layer on which our science and culture have developed\"), aka \"local solutions which have allowed the creation and management of ecosystems and cultural landscapes on the entire surface of the planet\".\u00a0\n\nPietro is an internationally known expert in the field. He is very busy but incredibly generous when it comes to Matera. His contribution related to content can be easily found online (articles, interviews); his contribution can also be in contacts accross the world, if\u00a0needed.\n\nRecently, the Management Plan for the Sassi has been published: it is mandatory for each UNESCO site to have one. 20 years later Matera starts the process (out of the Sovrintendenza's initiative). A participative approach was adopted. A 1st draft of the Management Plan can be found <a href=\"http://simposimatera.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/bozza.pdf\">here</a>.\u00a0\n\n<em>2. Do you have a formal risk assessment for your city? What are the most significant hazards, shocks, and stresses that your city faces and how do they affect the ability of your city to function?*\u00a0(2000 characters)</em>\n\nI (Alberto) discovered that a formalized assessment <a href=\"http://www.emergenzabasilicata.it/download/22_piani-gestioni/piano-definitivo-matera.pdf\">exists</a> but was never formally adopted by the City Council. Its author was Pio Acito, leader of local environmentalist association Legambiente and the local branch of <a href=\"http://www.emergenzabasilicata.it/index.php\">Protezione Civile volunteers</a>.\n\nThe plan focuses on the risks of earthquakes (Italy is geologically young and the whole country is a seismic area; 21 earthquakes were recorded between 1694 and 1980) and floods and landslides (the land is made of different materials with different physical responses: clays, limestone, marine sediment; 16 landslides are on record within the city limits in the past 50 years; 20 floods on record in 1928-1977). Less Matera-specific risks mentioned by the plan include: heavy showfall; hailstorms; hurricanes; wildfires; risks related to transporting toxic chemicals for manufacturing; nuke-related risks (there is a site for storage of nuclear waste <a href=\"https://maps.google.it/maps?q=centro+Enea-Trisaia+di+Rotondella&amp;hl=it&amp;ll=40.155786,16.644287&amp;spn=1.544995,3.361816&amp;sll=41.442726,12.392578&amp;sspn=12.117634,26.894531&amp;hnear=Biblioteca+del+Centro+Trisaia+Enea,+Strada+Statale+Jonica,+106+419500,+75026+Rotondella,+Matera,+Basilicata&amp;t=m&amp;z=9\">40 kms south</a>) and even the peak religious festivity, which claims a toll of snapped ribs and broken limbs each year (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-2cc0qFCQs\">you think I'm joking?</a>).\n\nThe local Protezione Civile network has contingency plans, mainly focused on earthquakes.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>linked to climate change: drought, desertification (calanchi), loss of productive land</li>\n\n<li>linked to land management: cementification\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>social impact: speculation (people living in appartments which are inscribed as offices), is there such a thing as the long term effects of living in an ugly neighbourhood? It is not only linked to the lack of services or low quality ones linked to urban planning, but it is also the question of what does it mean to grow up in an ugly environment.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>waste management: critical issue</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<em>3. Many cities already have some activities that are directly relevant to building resilience.\u00a0 What specific current or recent project(s), urban plan(s) or policy(ies) has made the most significant positive contribution to the resilience of your city?\u00a0Were there innovations that you can describe?* (2000 characters)</em>\n\nThe unMonastery is certainly one. Others?\n\nInitiatives from the<u> civic society</u>, whether through organizations or personal initative: the activities of <a href=\"http://www.legambientebasilicata.it/news/news_item.asp?NewsID=34\">Legambiente </a>(innovative?), <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oc49mtESSmY\">Profumo di Svolta</a>, <a href=\"http://www.benetural.com/en/projects/\">Casa Netural</a>.\n\nPolicies and urban planning: see questiopns in the mt2019 bid related to future of urban policies and citie's strategic development plan.

How do you define poverty and vulnerability within the context of your city?* (2000 characters)</em>\n\nIn the ECOC 2019 process, the vulnerable group selected by the conversation (which was open and online) were the emigrants (not the immigrants): i.e. Materans in their 20s and 30s forced by lack of opportunities to migrate to northern Italy or abroad. This does not make any group in the city more vulnerable, but makes the whole city more vulnerable as its demographic pyramid is reversed, and its productive capacity and cultural capital are slashed. Does this make sense?\n\n<em>5. Describe how you will bring multiple stakeholders, including the private sector and other levels of government (e.g., state and or national) together in developing and executing a plan to build resilience. Please give examples of key stakeholders.\u00a0 Which stakeholders do you think are the most relevant and most critical to success?* (2000 characters)</em>\n\nLots of work here that MT2019 has already carried out.

The whole point of resilience is to cope with unplanned-for events, so you can only talk about impacts contingent on specific scenarios. That said, public awareness is probably a key goal (if not \"impact\").\n\n<em>8.

Though no uprising happened in the country, most leaders and policy makers consider 2011 to have been a watershed, and accept that Morocco will not be able to maintain its stability and relative prosperity as long as its youth is disenfranchised and does not see itself as a part of the county's common future. Some specific challenges facing youth in Morocco:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>about 400,000 youth each year drop out of school with no qualifications.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>the disconnect between school and labour market is possibly more marked than in other countries. This is affected by a language switch between school and university: school (up to 18 yo) is taught in Arabic, whereas university is taught in French. French is, in Morocco, the language of business, and most employers prefer to hire French-speaking staff. Additionally, vocational training is fragmented: different government departments, NGOs and the private sector have rolled out non-interoperable vocational training programmes. Finally, part of university education was attuned \u00a0to employment in the civil service, but the civil service is currently not hiring \u2013 and in fact encouraging early retirement.</li>\n\n<li>the economic difficulties of the early 2010s (also due to slow growth in the EU, Morocco's main commercial partner) have set in motion an alarming mechanism of boys getting married later and girls getting married earlier, thereby increasing the pool of restless young men who do not feel invested in society, always a factor if instability.</li>\n\n<li>Islamist movements are on the rise.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nAccording to our witnesses, there is relative agreement across the main Moroccan stakeholders as to what should be the country's priorities in the face of these challenges.\u00a0\n\n<strong>Employment is priority number one</strong>. The official youth unemployment rate is 18.5% (2013, World Bank); but the real figure is likely to be much higher, once you count jobless youth who are not actively looking for a job and those \"employed\" in the informal sector where they do work, but receive no salary, only some tips. About 90% of employed youth works without a contract.\u00a0\n\n<strong>Civic participation is also a priority</strong>. Engagement in public debate is a powerful factor of inclusion, and Moroccan leaders believe young people who have a voice are less likely to become destructive. Moroccan youth are reportedly very disengaged: fewer than 1% of them engaged in volunteering activities (but the source for this, a World Bank study, was released in 2012 and may refer to pre-Arab Spring data ). On the other hand, there are very many NGOs in Morocco (reportedly as many as 100,000), most of them very small and dominated by charismatic founders.\n\n<strong>Data is not a priority at all</strong>. No one we spoke to had heard of open data; no one seemed to ever have entertained the notion that it would be a good idea to encourage the public sector to run on open source software rather than paying a company in Redmond, WA for using its intellectual property. However, Morocco does have a rudimentary open data policy, with the portal http://data.gov.ma .\n\n<strong>The policy response to these priorities does not appear to be particularly decisive</strong>. The Ministry of Youth and Sports (with the World Bank's technical assistance) has launched in 2014 an Integrated Strategy for Youth (SNIJ), which however suffers from several weaknesses:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>it was ten years in the making</li>\n\n<li>while it did attempt to involve young people to give their input, it did so in a way that was reportedly \"tokenist\"</li>\n\n<li>it contains a list of measures, many of which (but not all) appear generic and vanilla (awareness campaigns, institution of the National Youth Day, involve the private sector in reforming the curricula...) and others are demand-constrained (create a formalised \"first-experience work contract\").</li>\n\n<li>it relies on the Maisons de la Jeunesse network; these spaces, created in the 70s-80s, are to be the \"one-stop shops\" for youth all over the country; but they are now abandoned and dilapidated after decades of disinvestment, with few exceptions funded by foreign donors.</li>\n\n<li>the Ministry itself is perceived as a relatively weak institution. At the moment there is no appointed minister, as the person holding the charge had to resign following a scandal in late 2014; but even with a minister in place, the institution does not seem to have the necessary grit. USAid is building partnerships elsewhere (ministries of labour and of education; an integrated strategy for labour is in the pipeline); UNV is considering doing the same. Elections coming up in 2016 add some uncertainty to these maneuvers.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nA lot of the more promising policy efforts focus on entrepreneurship. The SNIJ commits to inserting it in the national curriculum. Some very active NGOs are promoting business and entrepreneurship among students, most notably Injaaz Al-Maghrib which, rightly, perceives itself as a success story. Injaaz has a Company Program whereby groups of students, during one school year, build a company (an actual company, not a simulation), then liquidate it at the end of the year. Some universities accept participation in this program as a replacement of the thesis. At the same time, Moroccan policy makers appear to be quite pragmatic in admitting that encouraging entrepreneurship, though a good thing that they definitely want to do, is unlikely to make a dent in the mass of young unemployed-underemployed youth. The only strategy perceived as realistic, it seems, is one that attempts to bring about piecemeal improvements, working on all fronts at the same time.\n\nFinding successful policies has been a challenge. Some programs have impressive indicators (Injaaz has involved 50,000 students), but those are indicators of output rather than outcome. Decades of effort towards youth entrepreneurship (with standard measures like training, credit incentives, mentoring etc. have yielded \"extremely weak results\" [Trust Africa]. For example, a programme called\u00a0Moukawalati (2007-2001) was able to to create about 2,050 new businesses and 6,180 jobs. The programme's stated goal was to create 30,000 new businesses and 90,000 jobs in three years. The main constraints reported speak of capacity issues: slow, bureaucratic processing of the applications; reluctance of banks to actually make the loans (in their defence, banks have lost money in the past with government-spawned schemes of credit to youth); low quality of the projects submitted by young beneficiaries).\u00a0\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">News from the grassroots scene</h3>\n\nWe started the outreach effort to get in touch with grassroots, high-autonomy initiatives. Due to the lack of an Edgeryders community in Morocco, we had to start from zero. For \u00a0now, we have discovered an <strong>open data community</strong>, which is tiny but has two precious relationships: one with Sarah Lamrani, director of e-government at the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, Investment and the Digital Economy; the other one is with the hacker community at large (Sahara Labs, Arduino Day etc.). There is also a small\u00a0<strong>social innovation/social entrepreneurship community</strong>, slightly more structured.Both these communities have strong ties with their much stronger European and global counterparts, via organisations like the Open Knowledge Foundation, Ashoka and the Unreasonable Institute.\u00a0A large charity, the OCP Foundation, has an\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.ocpentrepreneurship.org/\">initiative on entrepreneurship</a>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Three things we could do</h3>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Support the fledgling alliance between Lamrani and the open data scene. They could conceivably drive an operation around employment and data, for example aggregating the (presently very sparse) information on the (very fragmented) training opportunities available in Morocco. What opportunities do I have available if I want to be, say, a carpenter? Which training centers have the best records in terms of their trainees getting jobs? Can I compare the different programs (say, price vs. number of hours)? Etc.</li>\n\n<li>Investigate the hardware hacker, \u00a0Wikipedians and OpenStreetMap scene, starting from <a href=\"http://saharalabs.org/\">Sahara Labs</a> in Tarfaya.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Have a follow up meeting with Eric Asmar from the\u00a0<a href=\"http://mcise.org/\">Moroccan Center for Innovation and Social Entrepreneurship</a>\u00a0to scout out that scene. He might be in touch with promising initiatives via their <a href=\"http://dareinc.org/fr/index.php\">incubator</a>.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ol>", "created_at": "2015-06-13 08:43:16", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:25.654685", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1604, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 21.0, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856, 2201, 2566], "is_private": false}, {"id": 234, "user_id": 4922, "topic_id": 201, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n\nMay be FormStorm can not only be the post but the group, as the FormStorm doesn't necessarily end with the deadline on the 11th of December, anyone who wants to be a formstormer can assign related posts, thoughts and questions to this group.", "created_at": "2017-07-10 18:33:23.314001", "updated_at": "2019-03-07 16:51:36.191840", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 44, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12748, "user_id": 1450, "topic_id": 3429, "post_number": 5, "raw": "are the dates really 20-21, not 21-22?

A couple of thoughts on the software issue:\n\n-<strong>yes, education is no. 1</strong>\n\n<span>When I studied audio engineering, the first lesson was not 'this is a sound wave' or 'this is how the ear works' but rather 'this is ProTools, running on MacOS and you're going to need both if you want to work in audio.' These days I find it extremely difficult to convince other people working in audio/video/graphics that I enjoy and actually strongly prefer using free/libre/open source software over proprietary tools. Everybody learns on proprietary stuff, so anything else seems at least weird and foreign, if not unprofessional.</span>\n\n-<strong>no cost is not good enough. </strong>\n\n<span>Where there is a culture of pirating proprietary software, the 'free as in beer' argument has no traction - people already get everything they want for free and they don't have to learn any new software or workflows. The 'free as in free speech' argument is nice, but without being tied to practical advantages it won't convince many people.</span>\n\n<span>Such practical advantages of open source are things like:\n\n-backwards compatibility (your pirated Photoshop is CS5 so you can't open something made on CS6 - this doesn't happen in the free software world)\n\n-customization (it's usually easy to change standard behaviour, appearance, etc)\n\n-scripting, plugins, add-ons - write your own or (if like me you're not so good at coding) search, copy, paste.\n\n-small file sizes, long-term support, also runs well on old hardware.</span>\n\n<span><strong>some different ways to go about changing things:</strong>\n\nin Portugal, Ricardo and Ana from <a href=\"http://blog.manufacturaindependente.org/\">Manufactura Independente</a> have been a setting up read-only <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_dead_drop\">USB dead drops</a> containing libre graphics tools and resources in places frequented by designers and art/design students (universities, art supply stores). But most of the time people need some hand holding and encouragement, not just the software files, so this can only be part of a solution.</span>\n\n<span>OpenTechSchool is an excellent way to introduce tech to people in a social, supportive, low-cost, efficient way. Although focused on coding, there's no reason why the process could not also be applied to using and customising free software. Ask <a href=\"/u/kei\">@Kei</a> for help/advice on this, she's running the Matera instance at the unMonastery. I also know the original founders and can put them in touch if you like.</span>\n\n<span>Slow institutional approach (not really the Edgeryders way, but it can have a big effect). Lobbying institutions like local governments and education providers (who generally can't get away with pirating and therefore the 'free as in beer' argument makes a bigger difference).

Thanks to everyone who contributes a space, a talk, a food recipe, a song and what not. By the looks of it, we are in time to fit in the last ideas and make it even better.\n\nLet me quickly take you through what we have so far. On Thursday afternoon on Feb 25th we\u2019ll set camp at the main venue, SMartBe, start with a welcome word and introduction to LOTE, drinks, light dinner. We're being offered a sample of FuckUp Nights events that Antiheroes are running for some time now in Brussels and make the acquaintance of the creative and entrepreneurial local scene. Next up is a concert by Kira\u2019s favourite <a href=\"/t/id/5007\">Nele Needs a Holiday</a> singing candidly about losers and losing in career, life and love.\n\nFriday and Saturday are the fullest days \u2013 with most sessions going on in parallel in rather intimate setups (up to 20-30 people each). We will designate rooms in advance, depending on size and facilities. You will notice each session belongs to a \u201ctrack\u201d or a general theme \u2013 Development, Finance, Social/Health Care, or Culture and creative industries. This is to help us have some frames of reference and make sense of failure in our different professional and personal lives. All sessions are highly interactive, even the talks or presentations will see enough time for engaging with each other. \"Speakers\" are community members like me and you, or invited friends of the Edgeryders organisation. They are in touch, but not all are signed up here yet.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/8/84260a186f1b6a310cb44c3faa0a965604b0d631.jpg\" width=\"549\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\n<em>If you are hosting a session and your name is not on the <a href=\"/t/lote5/609/speakers\">speakers\u2019 page</a> yet, email <a href=\"mailto:noemi@edgeryders.eu\">noemi@edgeryders.eu</a> with your photo and bio.</em>\n\nSome, like Manzini, Palmer, @John Coate are prominent in their fields, and may even have solutions to unFailing. Others are very keen on throwing problems at the crowd to figure out something they obsess about. Some are taking part in an Edgeryders event for the first time, and coming all the way from the US and Canada. And yet all are up for making LOTE5 a level playing field, running imaginative exercises and making the most out of the diversity in the room.   \n\nSunday is for freestyling and going deeper into projects that we didn\u2019t have time to during previous days. Many sessions proposed last minute will probably end up for Sunday.\n\nConsistent with our Living on the Edge tradition, the kitchen will be a major attraction. For lunches we will have small cooking teams; our community chefs are already taking on the hard task of <a href=\"/t/id/5132\">planning</a> dishes for over 100 people!\n\nEvenings are for moving out of the main venue in other Brussels neighborhoods and touring the cosmopolitan city \u2013 Irene is arranging home cooked dinners with Syrian influences and music (Friday), and another evening where we get to be a part of one of the anti food waste initiatives in town, Disco Soup. A great way to mingle and hear stories of Brussels that one <a href=\"/t/id/4987\">rarely</a> reads about in the media.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/8/89f500a206a926e43230f760f2dac0c95661957c.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\">\n\n<em>Another one of SMartBE\u2019s artistic venues, LaVall\u00e9e, an artists co-work space where we'll be spending Friday evening.</em>\n\nI would suggest we agree to think and care about the following as we prepare for the event:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Remember that <strong>\u201cspeakers\u201d are not speakers</strong> in the traditional conferencing style. They are conversation openers for a given topic, offering a question that they, or the rest of us are all trying to solve somehow. Everyone should have a chance to contribute on the topic during that session.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Don\u2019t worry if your English is not good, </strong>participants come from many different countries, and someone will be able to help with interpretation if you need it. </li>\n\n<li>Think about how we <strong>harvest the knowledge</strong> and document our learnings. One thing we\u2019re good at as a community living predominantly online is sharing knowledge with those not in attendance. Make suggestions in a new post in the [LOTE5 workspace](/c/workspaces/lote5). Ping @Kaja.</li>\n\n<li>If you want to <strong>propose a new session </strong>or if you agreed to do a session but didn\u2019t have a chance yet, now\u2019s the time. Go to <a href=\"/t/id/5033\">the program</a> and follow the link to upload your session.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Pick sessions</strong> you like and leave a thoughtful comment to the facilitator to let her know you will be attending.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Tweet sessions</strong> you like using \\#lote5.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n*To the extent it was possible, we tried to keep individual preferences for days and hours, but you may notice small differences from your uploaded sessions.

To do this, we implement existing concepts, including \"Mixology\", \"Agape meals\" and \"Wabi-Sabi / Kintsugi\" on top of those daily activities. We'll try to achieve a natural flow, so people can step in and out at the right time and part take in what attracts them most. Part of that is adapting continuously to our surroundings and to our guests.\n\nEvery activity will have two components:\n\n<ul>\n<li>A practical part where participants are invited to physically partake in a food related ritualized activity. For this we will need supplies.</li>\n\n<li>A content part where one of the Edgeryders hosts helps guide the conversation to be as meaningful as possible. For this, we'll need enthusiastic hosts/guides.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## #unCookd - food preparation + lunch\n\nPhase 1: The first part of this is a communal food preparation activity, for which we'll try to collaborate as much as possible with the Food Hacking Base.\n\nThe food preparation/recipes acts as metaphor. The act of preparing ingredients, creating and trading new combinations of food stimulates is a good backdrop for discovering what people are working on, how they complement each other and what ingredients and recipes are missing. We start with aggregating what is already out there to support or increase well-being in some dimension of our lives: Existing social-technical infrastructures, working social tech innovations, active collectives and communities engaging interesting experiments/doing relevant work, especially ones outside English-speaking countries (i.e. we need to do this in different languages). We then turn them into \"Recipes\" for what we already know is out there (submitted by participants) and with [\"missing recipes\"] for what we need to build.\n\nPhase 2: Lunch. With the results of the food preparation, we settle down for an \"Agape-style\" meal. Note that it is not required that exactly the same people that joined the food preparation follow up with this lunch. Newcomers are welcome.\n\nAn \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agape_feast\">agape feast</a>\" is essentially a proto-Christian ritualized meal, where you sit together with a moderate number of people and have some kind of \"guided conversation\" while you eat. (Alain de Botton suggests reviving this in a non-religious context in his book \"Religion for Atheists\".)\n\nAt the start of the lunch, the concept will be explained to the guests, so they can agree to join or not. We'll form groups of 7 to 12 people (depending on the setup, acoustics, etc), plus a host per table. The host of the table is responsible for making the conversation at the table meaningful. While allowing for improvisation should the circumstances call for it, we can assume some of the topics from the food preparation can form the basis of the guided conversation, such as commonly mentioned challenges, motivation and the like. The idea is to look for more \"profound\" thoughts and topics and to keep the table focused on the conversation. There are several conversation forms the host can choose from or combine, ...: you could read from an existing text, have a \"round table\" conversation (where every guest has a chance to speak in turn), have (brief) moments of silent contemplation, pass an object or food around with some kind of assignment, etc. The goal is to ritualize the meal, by having a \"system\", by explaining what is going on and what is expected of the table guests. The host should also organize the food serving itself, in whatever manner seems appropriate (serving it themselves/having a central spot on the table/...). Of course, it is also important to have a proper ending to the meal, preferably including an invitation to the \\#unBroken tea ceremony later in the day.\n\n\n## #unBroken - (afternoon) tea ceremony\n\nWe will set up a special tea area, with pillows, small tables and the like. We try to get as many \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi\">wabi-sabi</a>\" style objects involved here, which means things that are worn from usage in a beautiful way or have been repaired beautifully (\"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kintsugi\">Kintsugi</a>\"). In fact, we actively invite bringing elements that are broken, but which can be fixed/mended for the tea ceremony (ripped pillows, blankets, small tables or chairs, cups and tea pots). We will also bring tools to fix these things on location. The tea ceremony itself will consist of a communal \"repair\" caf\u00e9, where we enjoy and discuss the beauty of worn/repaired things. Of course, tea will be served as well ;)\n\n\n## In detail\n\nRather than do everything ourselves we collaborate with Food Hacking Base and see how we can support what they are trying to achieve, and add our own activities in their program (<a href=\"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2013/wiki/Assembly:Food_Hacking_Base\">last year's program</a> ). They coordinate through: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/foodhackingbase/\">Facebook Group</a>, Mailing List.\n\nFrantisek mentioned that with CCC congress we have to be very careful not to \"serve\" food to the public because the commercial vendors are pressuring the organization team to not allow this. Also is seems there is no running water or drainage: so we need to come up with food that is fun to prepare together and works under these conditions. If we do something \"experimental\" it is more likely to attract more participants at \\#31c3 (see documentation from<a href=\"https://foodhackingbase.wordpress.com/\"> Food Hacking Base \\#30C3)</a>.\n\n\n### Food concepts / ideas\n\n<strong>1. Tea</strong> -- @Dorotea plans to offer creative tea mixtures. Needs: herbs (camomile, ginger, lemon), kettle, pot, cups\n\n<strong>2. WeMixology*: Creating and trading new combinations of food together</strong> in different \"sessions\". Each Session is dedicated to one dimension of well being, food acts as metaphor. The act of preparing ingredients, creating and trading new combinations of food stimulates is a good backdrop for discovering what people are working on, how they complement each other and what ingredients and recipes are missing.\n\n<em>*WeMixology is Inspired by the Mixology concept:</em>\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/1/12504ef891fd1dc7aa44824625981a3aff62bb90.png\" width=\"683\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\nIn addition to the actual ingredients (around 100) we will use the following:\n\n<strong>Cutting/ serving surface, knives, potato peelers, buckets or paper bags, and pieces of board/wood</strong> to serve ingredients on\n\n<strong>10-12m table with white cover: </strong> Main space devoting to creating, curiosity, creativity, playing, and mingling to encourage conversation around specific aspects of well-being.\n\n<strong>Projector &amp; speakers: </strong> Displaying what \"session\" it currently is. Close-up shots of ingredients, and mixed with visuals related to the different aspects of well-being and questions.\n\n<strong>Custom made notebooks:</strong> For writing reflections and recipes. We collect them before people leave.\n\n<strong>Customized aprons:</strong> Well it would be cool, wouldn't it? And it's something we all use after so no waste.\n\n<strong>* Light &amp; Sound:</strong> Ideally we would have different light and sound during each session- this is nice, not absolutely necessary...\n\n<em>*optional and depends on if people are willing to help make them happen + resources.</em>\n\n<strong>3. \\#unCookd: hacker recipes for healthy and happy communities: </strong>We start with aggregating what is already out there to support or increase well-being in some dimension of our lives: Existing social-technical infrastructures, working social tech innovations, active collectives and communities engaging interesting experiments/doing relevant work, especially ones outside English-speaking countries (i.e. we need to do this in different languages). We then turn them into \"Recipes\" for what we already know is out there (submitted by participants) and with [\"missing recipes\"] for what we need to build. Relevant work already being done: <a href=\"/t/lote4-stewardship-case-studies/418\">The Stewardship Case Study Adventures</a>, <a href=\"http://socialtech.org.uk/nominet-trust-100/2014/\">Nominet list of 100 Social Tech innovations</a>, [add more here].\n\nWe probably need to determine the following:\n\n<ol>\n<li>Title Summary A one-line description of the book, summing up its scope and content. </li>\n\n<li>Description:A concise description of the book including our approach, main topics and the subjects discussed.                                                                         </li>\n\n<li>Rationale: The reasons why the book is needed, the needs it will fulfill, its fit with contemporary literature.</li>\n\n<li>Short non-technical description: A short description that could be used as the basis for a catalog or jacket copy. This should be clear, informative and persuasive (175 words or less).</li>\n\n<li>Key features: If we had to give three key benefits that our book offers to its readers, what would they be?</li>\n\n<li>Table of contents</li>\n\n<li>Chapter outlines: A brief description of the main topics to be covered in each chapter, including the main references upon which the material is based.</li>\n\n<li>Length and delivery: How many words long (including notes and bibliography) will our manuscript be, how many illustrations will we be providing, are there other features, such as an accompanying website, that may be needed? Also when do we expect to deliver the completed work \u2013 we should be realistic.</li>\n\n<li>Permissions: Will we be reusing any previously published material (figures, illustrations, text) of our own or others? If so we need to give full details.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<strong style=\"color: rgb(233, 92, 46); font-size: 1.6em; line-height: 1.7;\">CHECKLIST OF SUPPLIES</strong><span> Where we are getting them | How we cover the costs</span>\n\n\n### 1. Ingredients for food:\n\n**Frantisek is producing a draft of the ingredient list over the weekend and open it to comments and editing.**\n\n1. Ingredients list has to be updated and well uploaded. We will need quite selection and ideally organic, fair trade if budget allows.\n\n2. Once the first list is up, we make the call for \\#31C3 participants to help us get to 100 ingredients by adding one more to the list (which they bring with them).\n\n3. There is at least one organization that redistributes food in Hamburg- Although usually for people that are homeless or can't afford to buy food..maybe they have good suggestions/want to collaborate?:\n\n    <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hamburger-tafel.de%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGXrvldCE9F3stb8eTNUexqLruFgw\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.hamburger-tafel.de/</a>\n\n\n### 2. 10-12m stretch of table &amp; White tablecloth:\n\nFor the working tables Frantisek recommends washable surfaces. Marcel is securing PE material which FHB want to use for flooring- we need to know if it's safe for tables too. Apparently if we use tables provided by orga we need to cover them REALLY well :)\n\n<em>How big tables we make depends on the materials which FHB get and their floor space (and <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/food-hacking-base-at-31c3\">crowdsourcing campaign success</a>). Last year FHB had three tables around 3 m long, 80 cm wide and 1 m high - workshop tables, thick wood (they gave them away after the event). One was dedicated to the \"experimental kitchen\", two workshop area. They had several usual desk folding tables provided for free from the organization for presenting their creations and to sit around (plus chairs, same source). We should get bit bigger this year but first they need to know how much space they are going to have, so lest keep this in mind and wait a bit for the data from the orga. Everyone please keep in mind we need many shelves, we had really big problem last year to keep things organized there it was hell to find anything - did not have proper shelving system.</em>\n\nWhite table-cloths is about the aesthetics, as this thing is a bit like a performance. We probably won't know what size the tables are till we get there, any suggestions for a smart solution?\n\n\n### 3. Knives, potato peelers &amp; cutting surface\n\nFHB have a lot of this from previous FHB events and can get the pieces which we are missing in second hand shops before the event. Frantisek is picking up their stuff around <span><span>16th of December</span></span> so he'll update the information about what we already have.\n\n\n### 4. Projector and white surface to project on\n\nWe need to borrow these, can someone help?\n\n\n### 5. Custom Made notebook: For writing reflections and recipes.\n\nWe produce these in advance, and hand them out to participants asking them to fill them out throughout the sessions. We collect them before people leave.\n\nThey need to: make it easier for people to talk to one another, share their magic new food combinations, and encourage reflections about their work and well being. Anything else? Add your suggestions here!\n\nDesign:\n\nMaterial:\n\nCost:\n\nOnline documentation: Would be good, they had it last year here<a href=\"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2013/wiki/AssemblyInfo:Food_Hacking_Base/notes_on_the_event\" target=\"_blank\"> https://events.ccc.de/congress/2013/wiki/AssemblyInfo:Food_Hacking_Base/notes_on_the_event</a> <em>\"but nothing in because we had major issue to edit 31c3 wiki - maybe we should make it on our fhb wiki?\"</em>\n\n\n### 6. Customised Aprons: Black organic cotton aprons + Pins or Organic screen painting\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/506936bc2e5eb5b19c34152e8972001d0b1c3755.jpg\" width=\"170\" height=\"500\"><br>I found a place <a href=\"http://www.foxxshirts.de/premier-workwear-fairtrade-latzschuerze.html\">where we can buy organic fairtrade aprons</a> (company based in Germany, we can ask them to deliver to the hostel where we are staying). They cost 13.29 Euros each. People can support the FHB activities in general by buying an apron (online e.g. crowdfunding campaign or on location).\n\n<strong>Customisation suggestion \\#1:</strong> I was also thinking maybe we could also make one pin for each of the activities (each activity would need it's own round logo), and people support the activities by buying pins.\n\n<strong>Customisation suggestion \\#2:</strong> <a href=\"/u/elf_pavlik\">@elf_Pavlik</a> suggests <span><span><span>we could screen print them there with some kind of organic ink...He's currently at </span><a class=\"profileLink\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/lapaillassehackers\" target=\"_blank\">La Paillasse</a><span> and will try to ask about glowing fungus</span></span></span>.\n\nSo this way we have a useful item needed anyway when you mess around with food, and colourful ways of both supporting the activities and customizing your aprons. If it works well, we have a nice way to fundraise for future activities.\n\nWhat do you think- Should I order them and if so, how many already know they want one?\n\n<em>\"This is great idea, want to have it every year and we never make it. Usual aprons with logos of our groups would be amazing, I believe people who are in vinyl cutting or how they call it could help on this. Anyone in the group? There will be vinyl cutter machines around the congress I'm sure if we do not make this in advance so we need just to put aside cash for aprons. \" - Frantisek</em>\n\n\n### 7. Garbage bags and paper napkins\n\nWe'll buy this on location in Hamburg or see if FHB an pick some up and we pool resources.\n\n\n## Budget\n\n**&lt;1500 Euros**\n\n<strong>List of ingredients: </strong>budget must be &lt; 500 Euros for 4 \"meals\"\n\n<strong>List of other materials and supplies: </strong>budget must be &lt; 300 Euros\n\n<strong>Cookbook design and layout:</strong> 300 Eur.\n\n\n## Fundraising\n\n1. Through crowdfunding: FHB already has <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/project/preview/4bcaa468\">crowdfunding campaign on IndieGogo</a>, maybe we could support them and if more money than needed by them comes in it can cover some of our costs?\n\n2. Donation box on location\n\n3. Sales of Aprons at markup [url coming soon]\n\n\n## How to get the word out\n\nThe invitation to #31C3 visitors to participate:\n\n* Engage people to add an ingredient they bring with them to the list of 100 : http://uncookd.meshte.ch:3000/#TWQPX6vm0MmnfxIjKwGMvMbL\n\n* Engage people to contribute a story, recipe or an ingredient to the unCookd recipe book.

Facilitators: Philippe Verstichel and Kat Borlongan. Policy makers-in-residence: Prabhat Agarwal, Fabrizio Sestini, Rory Smith at European Commission DG Connect. Thanks to Prabhat Agarwal for helpful comments and edits.\n\nThe parent session from which this sprung up was the \u201cRewiring Innovation Policy\u201d. The original question was: what would innovation policy aimed at supporting innovative networked individuals, rather than organizations, look like? In the course of the session, Edgeryders itself has been used repeatedly as an example of a network of innovative (to variable degrees) individuals. One hypothesis, confirmed by the early discussion, was that public support needs an organizational shell, for accountability reasons. Our sub-session looks at\u00a0<strong>what organizational form might Edgeryders take</strong>\u00a0to best support the innovative individuals participating in the network. Lessons were learned along the way.\n\n<h2 style=\"margin: 0px 0px 0.5em; padding: 0px; font-size: 17px; font-family: Arial, 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, sans-serif; color: rgb(90, 91, 93); line-height: 18px;\">What the terrain looks like</h2>\n\n<h3 style=\"margin: 0px 0px 0.5em; padding: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Arial, 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, sans-serif; color: rgb(83, 71, 65); font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase; line-height: 18px;\">CONTEXT</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>About 95% of public financial resources spent on innovation are spent at the national level. The EC is an important player, but by no means the only one.</li>\n\n<li>The EC is a public body subject to pretty strict accountability rules: every cent that is spent needs to be traceable. In this respect it is a defensive organization. It has several oversight mechanism breathing down its back; therefore \u201cit is in the paper trail business to avoid being shot down\u201d. In fact, most bureaucracies are defensive to some degree.</li>\n\n<li>When you think about what you want to achieve consider\u00a0<em>output, outcome, impact</em>. Suppose your project is to buy a 3D printer, use it to develop some great new product, and sell it on the market. Output is that you actually bought the machine, and you have an invoice to show for it; outcome is that you did develop some product; impact is that the product was actually great, and led to your company successfully taking off. Most oversight is at the output level, which is the easiest to check for. On impact \u2013 which is really what the policy is trying to buy in the first place - typically (so-called \u201cex-post\u201d) evaluations are carried out, not accounting checks.</li>\n\n<li>Risk-taking behavior (in the style of venture capital funds, that are designed to support companies that will mostly fail but sometimes win big) needs to be explicitly called for and acknowledged publicly. Pure accounting errors are targeted to fall within a so-called\u00a0<em>acceptable error rate</em>. For the EC, this rate is typically a few percent. This refers to errors on outputs. Some funding schemes explicitly accept risk in outcomes and impacts, e.g. Future and Emerging Technologies. But even compared to those, Venture Capital investors tend to accept much higher risks on outcomes and impacts, sometimes up to 95%. In other words they are happy that many of their companies fail (though with sound accounts).</li>\n\n<li>As a result of all this, giving public money for strange, inherently risky activities like innovation has a high administrative cost (the administrative cost of procuring standardized goods/services, like toilet paper, is much lower, because given specifications the agency can simply choose the contractor with the best price). This cost is more or less fixed: evaluating and managing a 50K euro proposal costs the same a evaluating a 2 million one. So, public agencies gravitate towards funding the large ones.</li>\n\n<li>These constraints are much less severe for private funding: trusts, foundations, philantropists etc. can give you money on a handshake provided their board of trustees has a hands-off approach.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3 style=\"margin: 0px 0px 0.5em; padding: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Arial, 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, sans-serif; color: rgb(83, 71, 65); font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase; line-height: 18px;\">KNOW THY ENEMY</h3>\n\nWhere there is public money up for grabs, there is a risk of fraud. The danger is highest for activities like innovation, in which \u2013 by definition \u2013 you don\u2019t know if what you build is going to work until you have built it. Fraud is discouraged by building a repossession mechanism into the policy: if someone can\u2019t account for money, they are sued and their assets (buildings etc.) can be repossessed.\n\nFraudster are your enemies. They poisoned the well, building a climate of distrust. To interact with funding institutions, you must look different from a fraudster. To the EC, a typical fraudster looks like this:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>recently constituted \u2013 no history</li>\n\n<li>no employees</li>\n\n<li>no capital or minimal capital</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nIn other words, exactly like Edgeryders and other networks of peers. If you are a network and you want to interact with institutions, you have to signal that you are different. Given that interaction happens through bureaucratic procedures \u2013 you can\u2019t go have a beer with the EC and show them what a cool person you are \u2013 that can be difficult.\n\n<h3 style=\"margin: 0px 0px 0.5em; padding: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Arial, 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, sans-serif; color: rgb(83, 71, 65); font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase; line-height: 18px;\">DISTRIBUTED AUTHORITY IN ORGANIZATIONS: TWO EXAMPLES</h3>\n\nSome networks have managed to style themselves as \u201cdistributed authority organizations\u201d. Two examples that might be worth investigating:\n\n<ol style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.5em 2em; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; color: rgb(90, 91, 93); font-family: Arial, 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, sans-serif; line-height: 18px;\">\n\n<li>the Open Knowledge Foundation. Great interface with the EC.</li>\n\n<li>the Pirate Party. That\u2019s more interface with the political space rather than the policy space.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nHypothesis: these are the result of a top-down decision to distribute\n\n[Ideas for this section (from PVerstic63) : I think OKF is good at tackling solutions whereas Piraty Party is good at tackling problems - problems space and solution space are two different animals - it looks to me that Edgeryders is neither in problem space nor in solution space, it is rooted in action space with a view to provide tools for the transition to a better future. So, with the buzzwords in mind, it is trying to have a social impact without pretending to have the solution - which is what in my humble opinion social innovation should be about. Hence the question of distributed authority is more a question of leadership rather than power relationships - the OKF in Italy is a typical example of authority by expertise (one individual is a great hacker in GIS). Of course it should not become a technocracy (which is another form of bureaucracy), there is a need for a kind of authority that leaves room for egalitarianism together with diversity.]\n\n<h3 style=\"margin: 0px 0px 0.5em; padding: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Arial, 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, sans-serif; color: rgb(83, 71, 65); font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase; line-height: 18px;\">THE DISTRIBUTED LEGITIMACY PROBLEM</h3>\n\nReforming organization in distributed power social contexts has a legitimacy problem. Can Alberto decide that, starting tomorrow, Edgeryders becomes an organization and just register it? Can Nadia, or anyone else? Who gets to be on the board? Who gets to be the figure head, the CEO, the President, the High Priest(ess)? Where do we incorporate it? The question is not technical, but relational: it is plausible that, if anyone makes the move, people will spend the next month discussing it. In a bad scenario, the community might even be destroyed by mutual accusation of appropriation... silly, yes, infantile, yes, but we\u2019ve all seen it before. Mythical founders are typically the right people for the job \u2013 like Jimmy Wales morphing Wikipedia from for-profit to non-profit.\n\n<h2 style=\"margin: 0px 0px 0.5em; padding: 0px; font-size: 17px; font-family: Arial, 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, sans-serif; color: rgb(90, 91, 93); line-height: 18px;\">Possible solutions</h2>\n\n<h3 style=\"margin: 0px 0px 0.5em; padding: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Arial, 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, sans-serif; color: rgb(83, 71, 65); font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase; line-height: 18px;\">WITH ZERO FUNDING</h3>\n\nNo, we don\u2019t do an Edgeryders org. ER remains a network of people; its purpose is to empower individual Edgeryders to do their thing. The network does not seek funding: we help each other access funding as needed. The ER network is not costless to run. We can sustain it for a year, by committing to each other the time to keep the online network lively; we can work towards at \\#LOTE3 in 2013 with near-zero funding, as \\#LOTE2 showed.\n\nThis brings a lot of political capital: we can actually sit down and interact with funding agencies, because we (the network) don\u2019t want anything from them, so everybody can relax and speak the truth. The session with the DG connect people was extremely frank and illuminating for many of us.\n\n<h3 style=\"margin: 0px 0px 0.5em; padding: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Arial, 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, sans-serif; color: rgb(83, 71, 65); font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase; line-height: 18px;\">WITH SOME FUNDING</h3>\n\nYes, we are going to seek a small amount of funding. For the first year, we should probably try to raise philantropic money, because the organizational profile of a newborn NGO is too weak for gov or certainly Euro funding. Also, a newly formed NGO can manage 20K, but would disintegrate under the pressure of accounting for 1 million. This requires someone to take charge \u2013 probably with the unconditional support of the more senior and influential members of the community.\n\nAn alternative funding strategy is to bundle the network conversation with some kind of activity (like the idea of systematizing the emergent pattern of collaboration into some kind of distributed consultancy) and run a Kickstarter campaign.\n\n<h3 style=\"margin: 0px 0px 0.5em; padding: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Arial, 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, sans-serif; color: rgb(83, 71, 65); font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase; line-height: 18px;\">ACTIONABLE: PROJECTS INVENTORY</h3>\n\nWhatever the fundraising decision, it makes sense for people to write in the platform what they are working on. This facilitates mutual recruitment: knowing someone is working on something.\n\n<h3 style=\"margin: 0px 0px 0.5em; padding: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Arial, 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, sans-serif; color: rgb(83, 71, 65); font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase; line-height: 18px;\">ACTIONABLE: EUROPEAN SOCIAL INNOVATION PRIZE</h3>\n\nIt would make sense to write an application to ESIP. Alberto (one of the judges) will declare conflict of interest and will not vote, but there is the off chance that we\u2019d get 20K no strings attached. Consideration Structure - now Edgeryders is migrating from being a Council of Europe project to something else - there is a greater potential for misunderstandings among the participants. Clarity and some kind of defined structure (social contracts?) is necessary to avoid this.\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div class=\"field field-type-content-taxonomy field-field-tags\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(90, 91, 93); font-family: Arial, 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, sans-serif; line-height: 18px;\">\u00a0</div>", "created_at": "2012-12-08 15:09:00", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 17:20:41.477567", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2471, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}]
