You\u2019ve said that you intend on shaping an umbrella engagement campaign for both projects, so I\u2019ll be framing this brief with that in mind. \n\nIt covers: \n\n* framing\n* POPREBEL engagement task/s\n* POPREBEL project wide engagement considerations\n* NGI engagement task/s\n* NGI Forward project wide engagement considerations\n* communications\n* project planning and reporting\n* recruitment and budget.\n\n## Collaborating to deliver and strategic considerations\n\nAs discussed, the project management team is here as an interface between the European Commission, our consortia partners and you to support in delivery of the best possible work packages we can. Unlike some of the other tasks, engagement calls for particularly close communication and mutual support between you @nadia and I because of the role it plays in Edgeryders\u2019 Research Network strategic positioning. We have agreed in distinguishing between engagement to bring people into the conversation - @nadia, and stakeholder relations involved in Research Network development - myself.\n\nBased on this, I wanted to reassure you that I am here to make sure your expertise and talent are free to lead your engagement activities as you see fit. I also ask for your understanding in my stewardship of our presence in EU research and innovation stakeholder relations and you\u2019ll see below, this will cover sector building, strategy and communications, which we\u2019ll both touch on. To be specific, I will continue to build relationships for Edgeryders\u2019 Research Network with Horizon2020 stakeholders and the Commission, while also contributing to project-wide engagement activities including leading Edgeryders involvement in the following tasks:\n\nT.1.3 :Topic co-occurrence analysis: where do technology and social issues meet? with @alberto\nT2.6: Knowledge transfer into consultation platform\nT3.1: NGI Topics: Future scenarios\nT3.6 Developing a shared vision for the NGI \nT4.6 National contact point & FIF coordination\nT5.4 NGI Visions Book \n\nWhich is a fine segue way to the juicey stuff and addressing your questions from our meeting!\n\n## Framing\n\nBased on the success of your work in the past, engagement in both projects was framed in the almost the same way as you\u2019ve lead it previously. We are grateful that you are willing to continue to collaborate on these projects and understand that this is being done alongside other professional activities. Let\u2019s make sure that we keep our communication channels open to support wellbeing as a priority in delivery of this work. \n\nIn line with this, there are no deliverables under the engagement tasks and only milestones for the onboarding workshops to be finished by the end of the second year on both projects (this lightens pressure and reporting demands from the Commission). However, you will be required to contribute to project-wide periodic reporting as well as the Consultation Insights report in NGI Forward. Please also note that as mentioned elsewhere the Impact Summit/ Conference sits in other work packages in both projects \u2013 in POPREBEL being lead by UCL \u2013 and is a milestone in POPREBEL while a deliverable in NGI Forward (more below).\n\nBy now you\u2019ve read the proposals and are across their objectives. The main thing I\u2019d like to foreground is that POPREBEL is a Research and Innovation Action while NGI Forward is a Coordination and Support Action, so their expected impacts are different. From the call, POPREBEL is expected to \u201cenhance the knowledge base on populism in comparative and historical perspective. It will develop indicators as well as medium to long-term scenarios on the consequences of populism, which will support policies, narrative construction and other actions to address the phenomenon.\u201d While also from the call, for NGI Forward: the whole initiative is expected to \u201c\u2026Shape a more human-centric evolution of the Internet; Create a European ecosystem of top researchers, hi-tech startups and SMEs with the capacity to set the course of Internet evolution; Generate new business opportunities and new Internet companies with maximum growth and impact chances, notably through the creation of startups and their scaling up in Europe\u2026;\u201d while NGI Forward as the technology policy and strategy CSA is specifically expected to enable \u201cEuropean research and innovation leaders driving the debate for a human-centric Internet research and policy strategy.\u201d\n\nYou made a sound point in our meeting; namely the opportunity to work out loud on the hypothesis of which the project\u2019s research is validating so participants can discuss it in a specific format; a kind of \u201cparticipatory reframing of research questions\u201d in your words. I have been advocating that all consortium planning and comms happen on the platform to keep partners there as much as possible to support this working out loud. This is going ahead. What\u2019s more, you will be able to highlight this and your engagement approaches further at both project kick off meetings in January.\n\n_Considerations_\n\nConsidering the symbiotic relationship between engagement and community management, @noemi and @johncoate have requested a session to work through **how the community management and engagement tasks interweave**. I agree that this will be of great value in making sure the boundaries between tasks can also act as interfaces. I propose it happens before you finalise your engagement plan - let\u2019s arrange it in the riot channel.\n\nPlease also note that the Culture Squad lead by @natalia @alex_levene and @noemi have and are preparing proposals around **REBELVillage** that feeds into POPREBEL. This is clearly a great engagement opportunity and also calls for consideration around messaging and impact. \n\n## POPREBEL engagement task (WP 2 Online conversations)  + Impact conference task\n\n**Project Abstract**\n\n[quote]\n\nPOPREBEL is an inter-disciplinary consortium of researchers focused on explaining and contextualising the recent rise of populism in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). While populism is a phenomenon that has by now emerged in almost every democracy, we believe that regional and cultural-historical dimensions need to be considered in order to improve not only scholarly knowledge, but also policy recommendations. It is urgent for Western Europeans to look into the CEE mirror, just as it is urgent for the CEE region to understand itself. To this end, we will create a typology of populism\u2019s various manifestations, reconstruct trajectories of its growth and decline, investigate its causes, interpret its meanings, diagnose its consequences, and propose policy solutions.\nOur focus is on CEE, but we engage in comparisons with populisms elsewhere, particularly Western Europe. While scholars from different disciplines have looked at populism, we argue that the full potential of interdisciplinary research has not been achieved yet. We draw on data and models from various disciplines and combine them into a rich study of forces at play. In addition to established methods of economics, sociology, and cultural studies, at the heart of our approach is a novel methodology whose essence is a large-scale, Europe-wide, multi-lingual online conversation. This is a listening exercise; its aim is a deep understanding of everyday life in Europe challenged by the rise of populism. The method to process this unique ethnographic material is semantic social network analysis. POPREBEL relies on foresight/future studies, deep involvement with activists, policy makers, and civil society actors to boost the immune system of European democracy. We develop scenarios and share them with all interested parties to reflect, in public debate, on how well they fit both in the CEE region and the rest of Europe. Our focus is not just scholarly; the project serves as a platform for mutual learning.\n\n[/quote]\n\nAs we've discussed already and has been mentioned elsewhere:\n\n[quote=\"anique.yael, post:15, topic:8932\"]\n**A very important note that Jan and Richard were explicit about is that we need to be very sensitive about the visibility of our POPREBEL work in some of these countries, particularly Hungary.** ... So it is important for the safety and security of our partners and collaborating publics that we keep a low profile in certain contexts. I'll be bringing this up with @nadia on engagement and suspect we can come up with some kind of political sensitivity/ visibility internal policy wiki of sorts.\n[/quote]\n\nA recap on the exact requirements associated to the task you\u2019re leading in POPREBEL from the Description of Action in the Grant Agreement (an updated version of the proposal; herein referred to as the DOA of the GA):\n\n[quote]\n\n**Task 2.2 - Recruit and engage participants**\n\n_Objectives of T2.2_\n\u25cf Establish and maintain social media presence across the project\u2019s four languages. Use it to disseminate interesting content coming from the platform. This directs traffic back to it, and drives signups. Goal: 2-400 hundred unique participants, 2-5,000 forum posts.\n\u25cf Run offline events to reach out to less web-savvy strata of the population and elicit new stories and contribution to report back to the platform. Goal: 12 offline events/workshops in the Czech Republic, Poland, Serbia and the rest of Europe.\n\n_Description of work and role of participants_\nTask 2.2 (Involved: EDGERYDERS)\n\u25cf We create POPREBEL accounts on the main social media. These are: Facebook (highest penetration all across the EU, except Estonia and Latvia), Instagram and Twitter (ranking second in most of CEE and most of Western Europe respectively). Use them to reach into the social media conversation across POPREBEL languages, sharing interesting content from the platform (starting from the \u201ccommunity journalism\u201d seed posts) and drawing traffic back to the POPREBEL platform.\n\u25cf We design, organize and run 12 onboarding events, aimed at collecting stories of lived populism. The word \u201cpopulism\u201d will be with caution, as it has negative connotations in some cultures, and might discourage supporters of the populist agenda. We partner with local organizations to take advantage of their networks. We report faithfully such experiences on the platform, re-share them on social media, which should drive further engagement and so on.\n\u25cf We participate into third-party events like conferences, political rallies, and other grassroots events. This is both a way to study populist tactics and strategies in action, and a technique to raise awareness around POPREBEL and recruit\nnew members.\n\n[/quote]\n\n**The milestone associated to this Task**: \nMS7: On-boarding workshops delivered. \nBy month 24 (ie. **December 2020**). \nThe means of verification: 12 onboarding workshops delivered.\n\n**The Impact conference**\n\nThe impact conference will be **lead by UCL** with our curatorial leadership and is written in as a task in the WP7: \n\n[quote]\n\nTask 7.5: Impact conference\nA final impact conference, targeting not only academics, but also \u2013 and especially \u2013 activists, politicians, journalists. Comparing notes, learning from each other, with POPREBEL functioning as a way to find and systematize the existing experiences. This is meant to boost the immune system of Europe\u2019s democracy by giving extra tools to the people in its frontline (EDGERYDERS - as per Section 2.2 of Annex 1, Part B).\n\n[/quote]\n\nIt is listed as a milestone for month 33. \n\n## POPREBEL project wide engagement\n\nYour question: which activities are tied to other tasks and partners and how do we insulate the work so we can get results regardless of others?\n\nI quote from p32 \u2013 33 of the DOA of the GA that summarises well all of the communication and engagement activities in a digestible way:\n\n[quote]\n\nOur communication and dissemination strategy outlined here is only the starting point and serves as a preliminary blueprint that will guide us as we seek to reach the maximum possible outreach to academic, policy-making, civil society and public circles within the EU and beyond. The detailed dissemination plan will be thoroughly discussed at the kickoff meeting and will be subject to further refinement at each consortium meeting. The overall objective of the strategy is to ensure that the research activities and findings of the participating researchers enjoy maximum visibility, multimedia\nversatility as well as use and engagement by a range of relevant audiences and stakeholders. Our guiding principles and the rationale for the dissemination strategy are the following:\n\n1. Stakeholders will not only be treated as dissemination targets but will also engage early on in the design and content of the research in order to achieve maximum policy relevance and use of the results.\n2. Communication activities will draw on the networks of the beneficiaries \u2013 at the local, national, European and international levels as well as with reference to specific sectors \u2013 to ensure the most targeted and effective outreach to different stakeholder groups at the most appropriate level.\n3. Multimedia and social media afford new opportunities to present, disseminate and engage in research. We are committed to taking full advantage of these opportunities in a strategic way, not by adding to information overload and embracing novelty for its own sake, but by carefully reviewing and selecting new tools and channels in view of the specific dissemination audience and purpose.\n\nIn order to disseminate the project results as broadly as possible both during the project and after its completion, the communication strategy of POPREBEL will include the following measures:\n\n1. Provide a communication platform for the consortium that makes it easy for all partners to communicate with each other and to engage with policy-makers, targeted practitioners and other stakeholders. The website will be an interactive means of profiling, disseminating and discussing results and publications. The platform will host the following:\n a. Working papers, thought pieces, open-access academic articles and policy papers\n b. Video clips (in the form of bite-size vignettes) of researchers explaining their findings\n c. Interactive blog posts, written by the POPREBEL researchers\n d. Links to the project Facebook site and Twitter account\n e. General information in multiple languages on different aspect of populism, linking to the websites of the organisations of our academic beneficiaries and partner organisations.\n2. Organise a research roadshow, whereby groups of POPREBEL researchers will visit specific CEE cities and organise a series of events aimed at different target audiences, i.e. workshops for anti-populism activists, advisory meetings with local politicians, seminars with academics and students, etc.\n3. Publish work highlighting the synergies between the various projects by means of at least 1 edited book and 1 special journal issue in addition to numerous individual articles and research reports, which will be available via open access (gold model). This includes policy briefs and papers on different WP topics, highlighting the objectives of the\nresearch, the scientific approach and methodology with the new knowledge produced within the programme and identifying key messages for POPREBEL\u2019s target groups. In addition to being uploaded to the project\u2019s website, all policy briefs and publications will be disseminated via other platforms available to our consortium, while all researchers will send publications to their respective networks.\n4. Use multimedia and data visualisation tools as well as social network tools \u2013 including Facebook, Twitter and video clips \u2013 to make research findings accessible in the most engaging ways for activists and the broader public and ensure that lessons learned are widely debated and circulated. We will use a selected set of research outputs that are conducive to multimedia representation and appeal to a broader audience and produce in conjunction with the authors engaging\ndata visualisations, audio-visual packages and interactive multimedia representations tailored to specific target audiences (all available on the POPREBEL website). This set of visually engaging and multimedia-enhanced materials will document key research findings, including a podcast author interview series and online data platform\nthat allows users to interactively visualise and explore some of the datasets and case studies generated.\n5. Convene panels and roundtables at academic conferences (e.g. BASEES and ASEEES). In addition, individual researchers will promote their findings of the POPREBEL project at national and international workshops and conferences. At the end of the project, we will hold an academic conference at one of the partner universities.\n6. Convene a series of research-to-policy workshops to facilitate essential face-to-face communication and discussion of results between academics and policy makers and lay the foundation for policy impact. These workshops will be organised in cooperation with our partner organisations. All the workshops and stakeholder conference will allow for the exchange of information and discussion between researchers, civil society activists, political and economic actors and members of the public.\n7. Organise a final impact conference, to socialize knowledge about how different public policies and political tactics can boost the immune system of European democracy (T 7.5, MS14)\n8. Publish op-eds, articles in national and international print media and relevant blogs, such as the Freedom House Blog. It is the intention of the project to encourage the publication of short articles, commentaries or essays in national and international print and online media during the lifecycle of the project. Both academic and non-academic partners will make use of their existing connections to newspapers for that purpose.\n9. Influence the current academic debate on populism in order to make it more responsive to policymakers and practitioners\u2019 needs and inform evidence-based programmes with measurable impact by exploiting the channels provided by our partner organisations, which have links with national and EU legislative bodies.\n\n[/quote]\n\n**Associated Tasks and Work Packages**\n\nIn particular, it\u2019s worthwhile noting that WP3: Culture is directly using the conversation as their core research corpus, and we are in dialogue about WP5: Economics to also.\n\n**WP6: FORESIGHT SCENARIOS**\n\nThis work package lead by our fellow Estonians at UTartu includes three tasks of engagement seminars that I mentioned in our meeting. Vello our partner there is interested in working together to make sure we\u2019re aligned in the strategies. \n\n[quote]\n\nThe central task of this WP will be to develop a foresight dimension for the POPREBEL programme, putting together a series of analytical scenarios based on the collected input from the other WPs and their studies of populism in Eastern Europe. The scenarios will be sensitive to different forms of the populist phenomenon, and interrelate them to different societal, technological, political and economic evolutions (drivers) that may come to pass. A second stage of the WP, in collaboration with WP 7, will be to engage three specific target groups -- scholars, policy-makers and members of the public -- in a structured discussion of these scenarios. These engagement seminars will not only appraise the completeness of the scenarios, but more importantly they will elicit specific reactions to how leaders and society should\nreact to different futures. In so doing, we will gain a better appreciation for the kinds of responses that may be needed depending on the confluence of events. The WP will prepare materials and develop strategies for dissemination of results and policy recommendations, in particular on the measures to be undertaken in order to boost awareness about the future stakes of populism and democratic resilience. Our dissemination and communication activities are organised in WP7.\n\n[/quote]\n\nThe relevant tasks are:\nTask 6.2 - Preparation of an engagement seminar with academics, policy-analysts, journalists\nTask 6.3: Preparation of an engagement seminars with politicians and policy-makers\nTask 6.4 - Preparation of an engagement seminars with members of the public\n\n\n**WP7: COMMUNICATION AND DISSEMINATION**\n\nLead by UCL, the Impact Summit sits in this WP and it is also where we\u2019ll be working closely with them on communications messaging and delivery.\n\n[quote]\n\nSince POPREBEL is designed for maximum impact and immediate policy relevance, the communication and dissemination strategies are at its heart. Therefore, we devote to them Sections 2.2a and 2.2.b of Annex 1, Part B. Here we summarize our main objectives.\nWP7 aims to ensure that the research activities, findings, original methods of civic engagement and policy\nrecommendations prepared by the consortium enjoy maximum visibility, multimedia versatility as well as use and engagement by a range of relevant audiences. The specific objectives of the work package are:\n\u25cf Formulate a joint dissemination strategy. It will be refined over the course of the project based on the feedback from target audiences;\n\u25cf Provide a platform for the consortium that makes it easy to engage policy-makers, targeted practitioners and other stakeholders to profile, disseminate and put to discussion results and publications;\n\u25cf Use academic research findings for making feasible policy recommendations;\n\u25cf Fully harness multimedia and data visualisation tools to communicate the research findings in engaging ways;\n\u25cf Convene a series of workshops, a research road-show and conference for different target audiences to facilitate essential face-to-face communication and discussion of results and to lay the foundations for policy impact and deeper policy to research dialogue in the future.\n\n[/quote]\n\n**ETHICS AND IMPACT PLAN**\n\nIt will vital that you work closely with our Advisory Board for Ethics and Impact on the Edgeryders Ethics and Impact Plan, and its implementation. It is a **deliverable at month 2** as follows.\n\n_D8.3 : Edgeryders Ethics and Impact plan [2]_\n_First draft of ethics and impact plan specific to WP2 and Edgeryders methodology (reference Section 5 of Annex 1 - Part B) in place and accessible as agile wiki._\n\nAnd from our section on ethics:\n\n[quote]\n\nAdvisory Board for Ethics and Impact\n\n1. EDGERYDERS appoints an Advisory Board for Ethics and Impact to obtain independent peer reviewing of the practices proposed within the project as it develops. Its members are:\na. Dr Marco Manca, a medical doctor (http://www.linkedin.com/in/mmanca). He is Senior Research Fellow at CERN and co-founder of ScImpulse Foundation. He leads the ethics section at OPENCARE\n(https://opencare.cc), a project that was applauded by reviewers for its highly advanced ethical stance.\nb. Dr Alberto Alemanno, a legal scholar (he is Jean Monnet Chair for EU law at HEC Paris), and a civil society activist operating at a European level (founder of The Good Lobby: http://thegoodlobby.eu/ ).\n2. Working with the ABEI, we produce a detailed and clear \u2018consent funnel\u2019, replacing the traditional (and ethically ineffective) \u2018I accept the Terms and Conditions\u2019 box to tick. A consent funnel is a gateway to the platform where participants can consent to sharing and handling of their information for the purpose of the project, inspired to the principles of honesty and transparency of the Portable Legal Consent (http://sagebase.org/e-consent). The idea is that the platform asks first-time users questions aimed at making sure they understand that they are in a public space for debate and should not reveal personal information unless they are comfortable with it being public. Users are not allowed to post until they get the questions right.\n3. The rules for access to all data, the mechanisms of protection, and the risks that entails from technical incompleteness (even with best practice) are disclosed in natural and clearly understandable language, with easy to get pointer to the mechanisms to opt in and out at any time.\n\n[/quote]\n\n## NGI Forward engagement task (WP 2 Collective Intelligence) + Impact Summit\n\n**Project Abstract**\n\n[quote]\n\nNGI Forward brings together a consortium of leading organisations in the NGI and the internet space more broadly to help further the Next Generation Internet as the key European entity and space for radical new thinking on the future internet, by both conducting and bringing together the latest thinking and cutting edge research, and reaching a critical mass of Europeans through our ambitious engagement strategies.\nOur main aim is to articulate an ambitious vision for what we want the Next Generation Internet to be, involving diverse voices in the process. We set out a clear set of next steps towards this vision through the development of technology, value and policy roadmaps, and build a network of the key European stakeholders we need to empower in order to achieve these goals.\nEmploying cutting-edge data methodologies we continuously identify newly emerging technologies, social issues and communities likely to play a key role in the shaping of the future internet. Understanding these emerging dynamics allows us, and by extension the European Commission, to become involved in shaping their development early on, embedding key values for the Next Generation Internet in the process.\nWe build a strong and vibrant community of key stakeholders (innovators, researchers, policymakers and the general public) surrounding these topics to drive forward the NGI, involving both leading internet thinkers and well established innovators, as well as young talent and otherwise untapped talent pools. Through leading edge qualitative and quantitative research (such deep learning, ethnography and futures methodologies), we map out the main research and policy needs and opportunities surrounding these topics, empowering our stakeholders group to take action.\n\n[/quote]\n\nAnd now the same for NGI Forward - a recap on the exact requirements associated to the task you\u2019re leading, from the DOA of the GA):\n\n[quote]\n\n**T2.3:Recruit and engage stakeholders [M4-M36]**\nPartner(s): Edgeryders (Task leader), ALL\nMotivation for the task: To build an active, smart, vibrant community of NGI experts through a targeted, accessible and inclusive outreach and sensemaking campaign to bring our stakeholder communities into the conversation and activities.\nIt funnels recruits into the online conversation of T2.1, which provides the activities of this task with a natural channel for follow-up.\nWork plan: We devise an ambitious engagement strategy to help attract users to the platform and to turn them into frequent participants in debates. We design, organise and run 12 onboarding events across Europe, aimed at collecting perspectives on NGI and bringing a broader stakeholder base into the project. These offline events are primarily aimed at reaching out to less web-savvy\nstrata of the population and eliciting new stories and contributions to report back to the platform, collaborate withexisting events ensuring conversations can continue online, and maintain an active presence across leading conferences and smaller fringe community events across Europe. We partner with local organizations to take advantage of their networks. This centres around recruiting and appointing four ambassadors with strong links in civic communities to undertake targeted and credible engagement their respective networks. We are aiming to have an online consultation platform of **approximately 1000 active participant-informants by the end of the project.**\nPartners role: This task is led by Edgeryders, but will also rely on the support from all other partners to draw in new participants and feed into and foster debates on the platform.\nRelationship with other tasks: Stakeholders will flow from other engagement activities across work packages, and from the data-driven stakeholder mapping exercises in WP1 and WP2 into the platform. Similarly, we will recruit event participants and key stakeholders through their contributions to the platform.\n\n[/quote]\n\n**The milestone associated to this Task**: \nMS5: 12 onboarding workshops delivered \nBy month 24 (ie. December 2020).\nMeans of verification: Final consultation platform onboarding workshop delivered.\n\n**Impact Summit**\n\nThe Impact Summit is written in as a task in WP4: NGI Ecosystem Engagement. Indeed this is a key work package associated to your engagement strategies as further outlined below.\n\n[quote]\n\nT4.2 Impact summit [M30-36]\nPartner(s): Edgeryders (Task lead), Resonance Design, Nesta, Aarhus University\nMotivation for the task: This is the final capstone event of the whole project, bringing together a wide range of stakeholders to reflect on progress made so far, learn from each other and highlight best practice solutions, we will help strengthen the community and provide participants with the knowledge and practices they need to effectively continue to create a human centric and democratic NGI.\nWork plan: We convene a final Impact Summit in M34 of the project targeting the cross section of the project\u2019s communities including researchers, innovators, activists, public administrators and policy makers, industry journalists\nand community leaders. Ambassadors from WP2, and selected NGI influencers will be engaged to curate a dynamic program, incorporating key points of debate and insights into participatory activities that produce co-designed tools and pathways forward. Goal: 1 three day conference with 300-350 active attendees and report.\nPartners roles: This task will be led by Edgeryders, with additional support from Aarhus University, Nesta and Resonance Design.\nRelationship with other tasks: The Impact Summit will bring together the dialogue, insights and multidisciplinary group of internet stakeholders mobilised across WP2, 3 and 4. Tools emerging from the Summit will be incorporated into WP5 communications, dissemination and the NGI Visions Book (T5.4).\n\n[/quote]\n\n**The deliverable associated to this Task**\n\nD4.2 : Impact Summit [34]\nFinal flagship event, bringing together representatives from all our key stakeholder groups.\n\n\n## NGI Forward project wide engagement\n\n_Your question: which activities are tied to other tasks and partners and how do we insulate the work so we can get results regardless of others?_\n\nAs mentioned, our engagement strategy is one part of an interdisciplinary and consortium wide events and consultation one. I invite you to review pp 22 \u2013 27 in the DOA for a full overview of events and communications and include below the summary of the events strategy for ease of reference:\n\n[quote]\n\n**2.2.2 An Ambitious and Cohesive Events Strategy**\nBringing together our stakeholders through events is a key component of NG Forward- indeed,\nthroughout the project, we will organise at least eighty events in over twenty European member\nstates (and beyond the EU as well). The events we organise range in scope from informal meetups to large-scale summits, and target a variety of different audiences. These events will not only serve as communication and dissemination tools but also play an important role in generating and validating project outputs, engage existing and new stakeholders and strengthening the NGI ecosystem across Europe.\nTo ensure cohesion between these activities and correct branding (and information sharing) across the different events, we have developed a taxonomy explaining the differences between each type.\nThe table below only includes events directly organised by the consortium. We will work in close\ncollaboration with the National Contact Points and FIF networks to support local workshops in\nmember states and ensure learnings flow back into our work streams, as well as with the other\nprojects funded under the NGI umbrella to ensure we align missions and dates, and collaborate\nwhere possible.\n**Event types**\n_**Informal meet-ups:**_\nGoal: Informal local NGI ecosystem building and locating potential NGI ambassadors and Award material.\nSize: This can differ significantly based on the nature of each meetup, but usually below 40.\nAudience: General audience, members of thematic meetup groups\nHow many: 25+ throughout the project, this number is likely to increase as we are keen to work\nExamples: The roundtable help by Resonance Design at the ThingsCon meetup is an example of aligning NGI material in and with an existing conference (in this case Europe\u2019s leading conference about the future of hardware, connected devices and Internet of Things (IoT)).\nSalons:\nGoal: Formal regional and national NGI ecosystem building in close co-operation with NCP, business alliances and civil society.\nSize: Capped at 30 participants (invite-only) to give everyone the opportunity to meaningfully contribute.\nAudience: National government, NCP, business community, startup community, civil society, artists, designers.\nHow many: 20+ throughout the project\nExamples: Previous salons held by NGI Move were held in: Ljubljana, Brussels, Warsaw, Barcelona, Amsterdam, Bled, Berlin, and Podgorica.\n_**Method-focused and outreach workshops:**_\nGoal: The workshops either serve to finetune NGI topics for upcoming work programmes, to build anticipatory regulation alignment between various levels of government, inform about upcoming calls and strengthen local NGI ecosystems.\nSize: Between 20 and 50 participants\nAudience: Experts in subject matter, NGI stakeholders, Regulatory bodies, citizens.\nHow many: 24 events.\nExamples:\n\u25cf Four co-creation workshops where we will collaboratively design a future-facing policy toolkit.\n\u25cf Two research needs identification workshops: to be held at leading academic\nconferences, bringing together leading internet researchers to set out their needs.\n\u25cf 12 on-boarding workshops to engage interested citizens and edge-of-centre experts in the\nNGI Forward online platform\n\u25cf Six matchmaking webinars helping find stakeholders find like-minded organisations to work\nwith (particularly targeted at open NGI funding calls).\n_**Flagship events:**_\nGoal: These are the largest events we organise, and are focused on bringing together our larger\nstakeholder networks.\nSize: At least a 100+\nAudience: Each of the flagship events targets a specific core stakeholder group (general public,\ninnovators, researchers and policymakers), with the impact summit bringing all together in one final event.\nHow many: We organise 10 flagship events throughout the project.\nExamples: Four public town halls, three innovation summits, two policy & research summits and one final impact summit.\nWe will harness our strong existing networks to collaborate with existing conferences and networks. Resonance Design is a media and knowledge partner at the IOT Council. Through this partnership, the consortium can propose and plan panels and speakers at any given moment. The IoT Council organises over 200 events per year related to NGI hot topics such as Big Data, AI, Blockchain, IoT, IT and Cybersecurity. Other important events and conferences on our radars: Re:Publica, CCC, FOSDEM, Transmediale, OuiShare, Mozfest, 4YFN, Quadrature du Net, IGF, ICANN, MakerFaire, etc.\nAs a consortium we have an excellent track record organising ambitious events at various scales. In the current cycle of NGI projects alone, both NGIMove and Engineroom have organised several successful events bringing together leading internet thinkers, such as the launch of the NGI Awards at the 4YFN conference, the Reimagining the Internet event at Nesta in February which brought together over a 180 participants (including many high level internet stakeholders), hosted salons and co-creation workshops in collaboration with leading MEPs like Marietje Schaake and Eva Kaili, and are in the process of organising five dedicated NGI sessions at Nesta\u2019s FutureFest festival, which will involve leading thinkers in the internet space such as Evgeny Morozov, Manuel Castells, Aral Balkan, Francesca Bria, Imogen Heap, Angela Nagle and Chelsea Manning.\n[/quote]\n\nIn our own WP, this Task is particularly relevant to your engagement activities, and of course those of @johncoate and @noemi in community management. \n\n[quote]\n\n**T2.6: Knowledge transfer into consultation platform [M4-M36]**\nPartner(s): Edgeryders (Task leader), DELab, Aarhus, Nesta, Resonance Design\nMotivation for the task: To make sure we foster interesting and meaningful debates on the platform, and give stakeholders the opportunity to reflect on the research and output generated under the banner of NGI Forward, each partner will be tasked with turning their deliverables and other findings into easy to digest and debate conversations starters. Reflections and comments from stakeholders on the platform will furthermore flow back into the other tasks, allowing us to learn and iterate upon this feedback.\nWork plan: Every time we generate a substantial new piece of research or thinking, we will commit to turning this into piecemeal conversation starters to be used as conversation starters on the platform. Focus here will be on generating engaging content, not just summaries. From events, we engage proven offline-online documentation methods to create\nshort video testimonials and main points of contention surfaced during panel discussions. From our data research, we focus on identifying the most thought-provoking stories and sharing interactive data visualisations.\nPartners role: This task will be led by Edgeryders and DELab, with significant support from Aarhus, Nesta, Amsterdam and Resonance Design.\nRelationship with other tasks: This task relies on outputs and content being generated by all other work packages.\n\n[/quote]\n\n**WP3: POLICY AND TECHNOLOGY ROADMAPS**\n\nThis work package is lead by Nesta and involves Edgeryders in two tasks. These are the tasks I\u2019ve written myself into and are relevant to your engagement work, particularly in terms of where the conversations will be leading. \n\n[quote]\n\nObjectives:\nThe core aim of this work package is to explore possible NGI futures, articulating an ambitious vision for a more humancentric and democratic future internet and articulating the policy approaches we would need to bring us closer to this possible future. To do this effectively, we have set ourselves the following sub-objectives:\n\u25cf By building scenarios on different possible futures of the core NGI Topics using cutting-edge futures methodologies, these scenarios will help inform the creation of policy and technology roadmaps and allow us to articulate policy frameworks that remain fit for purpose across a range of possible futures outcomes.\n\u25cf We develop a toolkit enabling policymakers to use co-creation and other methodologies to design internet policy following such an anticipatory regulation approach, enabling European policymakers to operate at the forefront of future-fit policymaking.\n\u25cf The NGI can only be a success if we have buy-in from policymakers at different levels of governance. We therefore collaboratively come up with a NGI policy agenda and accompanying manifesto with concrete policy recommendations we urge policymaking bodies to sign onto.\n\u25cf We convene a community of radical policymakers seeking to build a more human-centric internet to share best practices and learnings, and take collective action. This community will be spearheaded by the City of Amsterdam, afrontrunner in this space.\n\n[/quote]\n\nThe two tasks Edgeryders is involved in are: \n**T3.1: NGI Topics: Future scenarios [M3-M31]**\n**T3.6 Developing a shared vision for the NGI [M7-M36]**\n\nYou can review the whole work package on pp21 \u2013 23 in the DOA. \n\n**WP4: NGI ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT**\n\nIn WP4, we lead the Impact Summit and are listed as partners on three associate tasks\u2026\n \nEvery task in WP4 \u2013 lead by Resonance Design (our friend Rob van Kranenburg) - is directly relevant and significant for consideration in your strategy. Three of them include Edgeryders as collaborating partners. **You and I need to get clear on how these tasks feed into your engagement strategy and likewise with my own role in stakeholder relations, topic identification and policy and technology roadmaps across the project.** \n\n[quote]\n\nThe main aim of this work package is to bring together the core offline stakeholder engagement activities and flagship events, NGI Awards, mobilisation of new actors and collaboration across key NGI stakeholders. This work package is of crucial importance for building the kind of strong interdisciplinary networks we need to foster in order to position Europe as a global leader in a more human-centric internet with values like inclusiveness, resilience and openness and its core. 2 policy and research summits and 3 innovation summits will be organised, with the project culminating in an impact summit [pulling all of this together] flagship event, NGI Awards, mobilisation of new actors and collaboration across key NGI stakeholders. \nTo do this, we set ourselves the following objectives:\n\u25cf We organise informal meetups, salons and flagship events all over Europe. It is important that the Next Generation Internet is a diverse and inclusive initiative, so we expand our reach to cities and locations beyond the usual suspects.\n\u25cf To help scale and strengthen ambitious policy initiatives that could help further the objectives of the NGI, we bring together policymakers, innovation leaders and the research community from across member states to share best practices and empower them to take take collective action through the creation of a vibrant online network of engaged stakeholders.\n\n[/quote]\n\nIt is made up of five tasks as follows:\nT4.1 Meetups and salons throughout all of Europe (Resonance)\nT4.2 Impact Summit (us)\nT4.3 Policy and Research Summits (Nesta)\n**T4.4 Town hall forums (Nesta)**\n**T4.5 Innovators Summits (Resonance)**\n**T4.6 National contact point & FIF coordination (Nesta)**\n\n\n[quote]\n\n**T4.4 Town hall forums [M5-M34]**\nPartner(s): Nesta (Task leader), Edgeryders, City of Amsterdam, Resonance Design\nMotivation for the task: To more actively involve the broader general public in shaping the Next Generation Internet, we will host a number of town hall events across Europe. These town halls will empower citizens to share their concerns about specific aspects of the internet relevant to their local contexts through a citizen-jury like model, and give their opinions about how to collaboratively design the right policies and solutions to address these issues. These town halls will be ambitious events, working in partnership with local governments and like-minded civil society organisations, ensuring impacts and outcomes might actually have an impact on the local level.\nWork plan: Throughout the project, at least 4 of these town halls will be organised at different locations across Europe, involving between 100-250 participants each time. The content used to inform and frame the discussions will come from the topic and debate mapping in WP1 and W2 and build on the futures workshops in WP3. Topics of town halls will be specific, and relevant to the local issues a specific locale faces. These events will be organised in partnerships with local policymakers (city hall) and like-minded civil society organisations.\nPartners roles: This task will be led by Nesta, with support from the City of Amsterdam, Edgeryders and Resonance Design.\nRelationship with other tasks: Information and insights from WP1 and 2 will feed into this task. Insights from the town halls will directly flow into the articulation of the NGI Vision and set of recommendations in WP6.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote]\n\n**T4.5 Innovators Summits [M5-M31]**\nPartner(s): Resonance Design (Task leader), Aarhus University, Nesta, Edgeryders\nMotivation for the task: We will host three innovators summits during the project, bringing together the maker, startup and hacker communities that are now dispersed in their own channels. Based on input from WP 1-4 we will refine topics and output. A key focus is also on promoting the creation of small, multidisciplinary teams during these summits, particularly for the benefit of the RIA Cascaded funds.\nWork plan: We work closely with local actors in the ecosystems to build bridges between the various maker communities through the Meetups and Salons, we have an annual capstone event bringing this community together (between 100-150 participants). Working in close collaboration with one or two of the leading technology bloggers The Verge, CNET, or TechCrunch, we ensure content is disseminated widely and reaches new audiences.\nPartners roles: All partners are involved in building the conceptual framework for each Summit. Resonance Design and Nesta will moderate and streamline the output to the various stakeholders.\nRelationship with other tasks: Meetups, Salons and the input from WP 1 -4 will guide the content and scope.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote]\n\n**T4.6 National contact point & FIF coordination [M3-M33]**\nPartner(s): Nesta (Task Leader), Resonance Design, Edgeryders\nMotivation for the task: One particularly powerful mechanism for dissemination and building more sustained engagement with the Next Generation Internet community is the national contact point and FIF system. We think more can be done to involve this community into the core activities of the NGI by building bridges between them and our wider NGI stakeholder communities.\nWork plan: National contact points are responsible for disseminating the NGI in their respective member state and organising workshops for local stakeholders, and function as a source of information and support for those seeking to engage with the initiative. We believe that weaving these activities into core NGI Forward outputs can help strengthen the synergies between both communities (now quite fragmented), and bolster the wider NGI community. In this task, we\nwill provide a space for information and learnings for our NCP community, maintain a frequent line of communication and channel our support to on the ground activities.\nPartners roles: This task will be led by Nesta, with support from Resonance Design and Edgeryders.\nRelationship with other tasks: Where possible, we will directly involve the FIF and national contact point networks into our events and stakeholder activities, such as the salons (T4.1), the Impact Summit (T4.2) and the consultation.\n\n[/quote]\n\nSee see pp26 \u2013 28 of the DOA if you\u2019d like to read on each task in detail.\n\n\n**WP5: COMMUNICATIONS**\n\nAnd of course clearly the work package on comms is directly relevant to your engagement work. Lead by Nesta it features three tasks that are relevant to your engagement strategy, including the Community journalism programme which we need to discuss further with @johncoate and @noemi in terms of leadership and roll out. We have 12 PMs for this work package and as you and I talked about, in addition to the two aforementioned tasks, there is budget for us to engage a comms specialist that will work with you and I.\n\nComms specialist:\n\n[quote]\n\n**T5.1 Media outreach and dissemination [M2-M36]**\nPartner(s): Nesta (Task leader), Edgeryders, Resonance Design.\nMotivation for the task: Absolutely key to generating the kind of impact we need to make the Next Generation Internet a household name across Europe is to disseminate our wide range of project activities through existing mass media and social media channels, as well as tap into newly emerging media formats such as the growing vloggers community. To do this most effectively, we have merged these efforts into one task involving all partners to ensure we develop a shared voice, visual identity and coherence across different project activities.\nWork plan: At the start of the project, we will collaborative draft a shared communications strategy document that will set out key modes we plan to engage with key media channels. As the intellectual core of the NGI, we will generate a lot of interesting outputs, which we commit to turning into more engaging and public facing outputs as well (responsive blogs, data visualisations, short videos) to reach a wider audience. This task also involves establishing media partnerships and engaging social media outreach. We will work in close collaboration with the press office to ensure consistency across NGI projects.\nPartners role: All partners will contribute to this task.\nRelationship with other tasks: This task will help with fuelling conversation on the consultation platform and during salons.\n\n[/quote]\n\nCurrently written as lead by @johncoate:\n[quote]\n\n**T5.2 Community journalism programme [M5-M24]**\nPartner(s): Edgeryders (Task leader), Nesta\nMotivation for the task: To help stimulate conversation, and give voice to our grassroots communities, we encourage passionate and vocal members of the online community (in liaison with external journalists and thinkers) to create content that seeds topical debate on the platform.\nWork plan: We deploy a community journalism program. This consists in engaging respected and accessible voices with a good social media presence and commissioning them high-quality posts on their perspectives around a human-centric next generation internet. This creates \u201cseed\u201d content that can be re-shared on social media in T2.2 to aggregate debate, attract new users and new contributions. We aim to commission 60 such pieces over eighteen months of the project.\nPartners role: This task will be led by Edgeryders, with support from Nesta, and inviting recommendations and\ncontributions from other partners.\nRelationship with other tasks: This task will help with fuelling conversation on the consultation platform and stakeholder events such as the salons.\n\n[/quote]\n\nOne of the tasks I\u2019ll be responsible for:\n\n[quote]\n\n**T5.4 NGI Visions Book [M6-M20]**\nPartner(s): Nesta (Task leader), Edgeryders\nMotivation for the task: To help really solidify the NGI\u2019s position as a hub for interesting thinking on the internet and and motivate our community, we need ambitious and provocative visions for what the internet could be. This is why we will create a second edition of the NGI Visions Book, building on the successful model currently underway in EU Engineroom. This book will be released as both a website and physical print book, bringing together essays and visions for the future internet by leading internet thinkers, emerging voices, and creative outputs such as photo essays, data visualisations and sci-fi stories reflecting on the topic of building a human-centric internet.\nWork plan: We commission between ten and fifteen written contributions from high-profile thinkers in the internet space, as well as ten more creative outputs by artists (illustrations, photography, interactive data visualisation, videos on relevant youtube channels, short stories, comics). These contributions will be turned into a dynamic, well-designed website and a hard-copy book. Though we plan to release the visions book mid-way through the project (M20), we will separately release content on a more trickled-through schedule, ensuring we have a constant stream of interesting content to engage our audience.\nPartners role: This task will be led by Nesta, inviting creative inputs from other partners.\nRelationship with other tasks: This task is one of the core public facing outputs of the project, and will be disseminated through other stakeholder engagement tasks. Potential contributors will be scouted through the community journalism programme and other channels.\n\n[/quote]\n\n## Communications \n\nTo continue on comms, as discussed in our meeting, it requires great consideration and sensitivities across both projects. In addition to you and I working closely on communications as they extend beyond your outreach campaigning to meet consortia wide guidelines, POPREBEL has political sensitivities the consortia needs to attend to, and and in the case of NGI Forward, significant collaboration will be required with the project tasked with communications for the  whole NGI initiative. From the call: \n\n[quote]\nvi) 'Outreach Office': will execute the programme communication strategy, branding and marketing activities, including extensive online and social media presence and events, establishing a positive brand image among young researchers, innovators, policy makers and people at large. Centralised, more efficient and professional, it will lead communications towards the outside world but also coach all actions under this topic in effective communications and marketing.\n\n[/quote]\n\nI have chosen to wait on the comms brief in light of the above and limited background on it until the projects start. **This is something we\u2019ll need to bring up for further clarification at the kick off meetings in January, particularly for POPREBEL as you\u2019ll be starting engagement so early on.**\n\n## Project planning and reporting\n\nAs per [this post](https://edgeryders.eu/t/h2020-teams-what-we-need-what-you-need-what-i-need-what-they-need/8973/1, ) \n\n[quote=\"anique.yael, post:1, topic:8973\"]\n\nWith two large projects it is vital that we have light and easy planning and reporting tools.\n\nAn Edgeryders Major Milestones calendar has been created as per here. While Teams can of course plan their implementation how they choose, I ask you to keep your key milestones in the calendar and Dynalist so that my team can keep across project delivery.\n\nI have consolidated Dynalist as per the Dynalist Manual, and created sub-category's for each team leader to document both project wide planning at present. From it:\n\n\nTask leaders, you are invited to document here your planning for both research projects and associated scaling. \nFor project specific planning, please feel free to create your own sub-category using the H3 format - for example: \nPOPREBEL multilingual community management and ethnographic coding with partners below\nNo matter what, please note major milestones in the Edgeryders major milestones calendar\nWe are working that your tasks are automatically synced to the calendar.\n\n\n@matthias and I are also developing a suite of streamlined reporting tools that all Team members will use to log time and budget spent. They will be shared when finished by projects\u2019 kick off.\n\nOnce again, this is a little dipping our toes in the water so that we can feel secure and let the excitement of these extraordinary projects drive us. I am open to your reflections.\n\n[/quote]\n\nSo in short:\n-\tPlease document key milestones in the **Edgeryders Events calendar and Dynalist** \n-\tPlease join the **team stand ups on every second Monday at 17:00 CET** from 7 January 2019 (see your calendar) which will be short calls between the teams to keep us cohesive, informed and in joy. \n-\tPlease document on the platform and work with the project management team around reporting\n\n## Recruitment and budget\n\nFurther to the call in October with the other team leaders on recruitment I invite you to review its documentation [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/h2020-teams-what-we-need-what-you-need-what-i-need-what-they-need/8973/17?u=anique.yael).\n\nAs I understand it you\u2019ll be recruiting someone to work with you on administration and coordination, and the project coordinator from my team will work closely with them to try to keep the silly stuff out of the picture. In addition, the engagement task has budget for 3000 EUR per onboarding workshop to engage a partner or practitioner in each target community. As discussed above and elsewhere, we\u2019ll convene in a collective call on how to work with the impact summits and community journalism programme. \n\nIn terms of allocated budget to your tasks, while we discussed the scope in our meeting please keep in mind that these continue to be moving. I\u2019m hoping to prepare the Magic Budget spreadsheets for both projects this week and will be running all team leaders by them accordingly.\nI suspect more questions will arise and of course feel free to share them here or we can have another meeting to discuss. In our last we talked about you drafting a plan up based on this for our review, so let me know if there\u2019s anything else I can do to support that.\n\nThis is an epic engagement scope for sure. I have no doubt that you will rock rolling it out and there will be magic in the process.

We collect knowledge and practices that people in different sectors are using to keep their businesses afloat right now. People discuss and share advice with one another by leaving thoughtful comments to each article. Contributors then receive invitations to opportunities for further learning and collaboration.**\n\n*In the first session of Edgeryders\u2019 co-working event, the conversation opened with a discussion on how changes in technology and society have led to distributed work and how Covid-19 has further propelled that. The concept of distributed economic development was introduced.*\n\n*Various players within the co-working sector spoke about how people are afraid to return to co-working spaces because of the virus and some suggested access technologies are a barrier for many attracting back workers. Examples were given of how to generate revenue streams during tight restrictions.*\n\n## What has changed to bring about distributed work?\n\n**1. Technology - the smartphone**\n\n\u201c Smartphones went from being a new, crazy thing to being everywhere\u2026 So much people are using free video on smartphones, so there\u2019s enough usage of internet on smartphones now that it\u2019s the predominant traffic for the internet.\u201d\n\n**2. For the first time in history we have five generations working at the same time.**\n\n\u201cIn the United States in 2016, millennials became the largest segment of the U.S. workforce. And in 2020 later this year, Gen Z will become the second largest segment of the workforce.\n\n\u201cThe other interesting factor is a bunch of people have not retired because their savings got wiped out during the last financial crisis, so they\u2019re staying in the workforce longer.\u201d\n\n**3. Covid**\n\n\u201cThese were all happening at the same time. Then Covid appeared on the scene and has been an accelerator of a bunch of these things.\n\nBecause of COVID, many companies that are actually thinking through how they run their operation are already deciding that offices were not working for them and they\u2019re not going back.\u201d\n\n**4. Commuting\u2019s impact on the environment**\n\n\u201cPeople who can\u2019t afford to live that close to the office ended up spending more and more time commuting to and from work. And you end up having this phenomenon of commuter towns or bedroom communities built for people who sleep there.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to the California Air Resource Board people driving personal cars mostly to and from work, is 28% of all emissions from California it\u2019s 28%.\n\n\u201cEverything else in the state of California trucks, planes, agriculture, electricity stations each of these things are all under 10%. The only thing over 20% at 28% is people driving cars to and from work.\u201d\n\n**Rethinking the economic model**\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that a YouGov survey in England just last week found that only 6% of people wanted life to be back the same as it was before COVID. 6%. 94% were not happy with the way it was before. Now, what to do about it?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, a traditional economic development is when a jurisdiction will give money to a large employer and the larger employer moves to your town. The company will pay taxes, so eventually the jurisdiction gets your money back.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat used to work and that was why people did traditional economic development for so long. But the social changes I talked about at the beginning changed all that. No more job for life means employers, when they move to a location, only want to move to a location where there are pre-trained and unemployed candidates waiting to be hired.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s not enough, then they\u2019ll find ways to bring people who have the right skills. That sudden influx of people can cause gentrification and displacement of the existing humans who live there.\u201d\n\n**Distributed economic development**\n\n\u201cI want to introduce an idea called distributed economic development. This is the heart of a law I helped write for the state of ...This remote worker law has four essential parts.\n\n1. \u201cOne, remember that humans are a social species. Even if we have high speed internet at home and we can work from home all the time, we still need and want social interaction with other humans. That allows us to work online for extended periods of time and still have social contact.\n\n2. \u201cNumber two, find an existing unused building in a small town in a formerly workable neighborhood and convert it into a mixed-use neighborhood coworking space. Every one of these towns I\u2019ve gone to has got empty buildings all over Main Street.\n\n3. \u201cRemodel that building doesn\u2019t demolish it, it is part of the character of the town. Remodel the building with a specific layout.  Different to your typical coworking spaces that you see in large metro cities, these are designed to work with small community spaces. And they\u2019re designed to increase foot traffic to the nearby other businesses so that they also start to become more vibrant and alive.\"\n\n\n4. \u201cAnd the last part is to provide incentives for some knowledge workers, a small group, some knowledge workers to move to your community to help introduce these new concepts into daily life and start the movement.\n\n*\u201cSo literally, how does it work? Okay. People moved to your neighborhood, bringing their existing jobs with them and they start working from your neighborhood coworking space. Even if they change employer jobs every couple of years, they still live in the same neighborhood, they still walk to work online from the same neighborhood coworking space.\u201d*\n\n## What challenges are those in the coworking space faced with now and how are people navigating it?\n**1. Accessibility**\n\n\u201cIn terms of accessibility, I have coworkers who are extremely vulnerable right now and they are not prepared. They need to work. There are things they need to do for their business, and they are not prepared, as you say, to get on public transportation and start wandering about. So what we have is other coworkers who support them in that, right? My community manager does essentially, in increments of 10 minutes, simple things like taking packages to the post office. This is life threatening for some people.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that coworking really, in general, in Europe, the problems are, in many ways, with accessibility, much more complex than they are in the States, because the buildings are older.\n\n\u201cThere are things structurally that can be done within this space, setting things up in zones, high stimulation zones, and low stimulation zones, often close to each other. I have coworkers, on the whole neuro diverse spectrum, I have coworkers on this side who really need stimulation, and they want the desks next to the kitchen, where people are walking, and banging and hollering at each other. And I have coworkers on the other end of the neurodiversity spectrum who really need to have a limit on the amount of stimulation around them.\u201d\n\n## How to make money when restrictions are forcing your coworking space to stay closed?\n\n**Three possible quick solutions:**\n\n1. \u201cOne is even when the place is closed, the physical coworking space is closed, still enabling that people could use the wifi\u2026 but actually leave the wifi and make it accessible from outside the building, if you\u2019re not allowed to open the building. So that your members can still some use.\u201d\n\n2. \u201cMembers have keyless entry because of their app. And for specific individuals who are specific already existing members, they could come and work from there if there was nobody else, or very, very low occupancy in the building. So they could let one or maybe two people into the space. If they needed a place to do an important call that was not possible at home because of the whole school situation. So that was an option.\u201d\n\n3. \u201c...actually these physical spaces, they\u2019re a really valuable infrastructure for coordination because there are places where you can put up information, there are places where you can drop off and pick up stuff.\u201d\n\n\u201cI got a package delivered here today in... because it\u2019s not possible in our temporary apartment here. That simple thing is another reason why I pay my membership at the moment. So those fundamentals also can be important.\u201d\n\n\n## What are others doing?\n**Slashing prices**\n\n\u201cAbout six weeks ago, we thought we would try something completely different in terms of our...space, where we were charging anywhere between 300, and 375 for a desk. So we put it out to our fairly extensive mailing list that we would do a post-COVID thing at 65 euros a month. We don\u2019t make money on 65 euros a month obviously, but it wasn\u2019t about making money. It was really just about getting the space full again. Well, actually I say full again, we can\u2019t be full again because of the social distancing. But we were able to get half of the desks filled and maintain two meter social distancing.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\n**Child care**\n\u201cHave you seen the radical childcare project from the artist formerly known as Impact Hub in Birmingham? And also if you look up Shazia from Third Door in London, they\u2019re really the people connected to us, who talk about the childcare thing, because it\u2019s exploded, like you said.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\n**Opening city living co working spaces and advertising using outside boards**\n\u201c(There\u2019s) a space called\u2026 Good Space, which is opening in Queens parking in London. And so he came to the call today and he\u2019s (the owner) a big fan of the 15 minute city and stuff like this. We\u2019re like, \u201cOh Dave, how\u2019s it going, mate?\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cOh, well I\u2019ve had 37 members join in the last week, last four weeks.\n\n\u201cAnd he only opened like four weeks ago and everyone was like, \u201cSo what did you do? What did you do?\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cI just put\u2026\u201d basically he put an A board outside his thing and he\u2019s on a busy place. And then he went round and spoke to a lot of people in the neighborhood.\n\n\u201cAnd one of the key things is the A board, which is a very traditional thing. So he didn\u2019t have some wacky Facebook giveaway. He just put an A board outside. He is connected, he makes an effort to talk to people in the neighborhood. And also, there was one other thing he did, which was really, really simple and it\u2019s gone, but it will come back.\u201d\n\n...\n\n### If you have any thoughts on ways coworking spaces can make revenues stream during this difficult period or any examples of innovative projects in this space you have come across -  please comment below and add to the conversation!\n# \n\n*This will give you access to the comments from other participants, as well as the next article in our series.\nLeaving a thoughtful comment will also give you access to our online community platform.

With many  forced to work from home throughout the crisis, life and work became entwined. Coworking spaces could give parents a breather and one coworking facility put together a deal that focused on couples with children \u2026*\n\n**Attracting couples with children**\n\n\n\u201c... results investing in couples, because they're going crazy with the kids inside of the house. You want to atttract the couple so that you can make plans that the father comes in the morning or the mother comes in the afternoon, or perhaps one day the mother one day the father. Because one of the parent's going to sacrifice themselves to take care of the child, and the other one's going to get some work done so they can make something like that. \n\n\"We've just started to do that and we've been getting really great results. But it's really in the beginning. Those are desperate people, so they need it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the most successful things in coworking (spaces) here in town is actually providing childcare instead of (just) the coworking. So basically taking care of the kids while the father or mother is actually working inside the co-working space with an expert on childcare on the specific room dedicated for this. This is super helpful at this moment.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBecause if there's anything we can all agree on, apart from not knowing what's going on in the future, it's also that the last three months or four months have been a great test of what happens when there's no childcare in place.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that's what most people are looking forward to in September. Not just shipping the kids off to school, but getting some routine back and going on, because I think every one of us has probably heard this to death, but in terms of having all of this imposed on us, as opposed to actually working the way we all want\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn't matter if you have been remote working for years. If you're suddenly homeschooling in the mornings, your day has changed. But it's just a question again, does anyone who's running a co-working space looking to bring that on board as a service and potentially the all important one from a pure business point of view revenue line?\u201d\n\n\u201cHere in Brazil, the legislation to bring a person to take care of other people's child is going to be impossible for safety and things like that. So we cannot even... We're not even going to touch that.\u201d\n\n**Solidarity groups**\n\n\u201cBeing around other people's offspring all day ... it's a question if that's going to work for everyone. But what we are seeing is that there are solidarity networks that are popping up around businesses and with logistics and all of this stuff, so maybe they can work together with the spaces. Because one of the things they (the solidarity networks) are complaining about is lack of physical spaces to coordinate around. In Stockholm, one of my partners has a coworking space and they turned it into a factory for protective gear for nurses and doctors, frontline medical workers. And the other thing that happened is that they also have been focusing more on artists. The community of people who are renting spaces for studios that has gone up while the desk rental has gone down. This could be an opportunity to align interests and resources.\u201d\n\n...\n\n\n\n*This summary is from an event was part of the NGI Forward project Generation Internet (NGI) initiative, launched by the European Commission in the autumn of 2016.

Both Future Makers and the Edgeryders community as a whole\u00a0need a meta strategy, roadmap and tools for making collaboration attractive and sustainable at scale.\n\n2. The reason is that becoming really good at using our limited resources efficiently is a winning evolutionary strategy \u00a0(see Grayson Energy Matrix and\u00a0&gt;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irruptive_growth\">Irruptive growth</a>). Collaboration between different actors is a good way to pool and make very efficient use of resources to help each other become more resilient.\n\n3. In light of this possible valuable outcome/producta of Future Makers that the existing and new community members would get excited about contributing to is\u00a0a collaboration generator: people go in, something happens, collaborations come out.\n\n4. Another possible valuable outcome/product of Future Makers is\u00a0a relationship builder:\u00a0that people get to (quantifiably) connect and build new relationships (see our\u00a0<a href=\"http://edgeryders.edgesense.spazidigitali.com\">Edgesense Network Visualisation too</a>l and\u00a0<a href=\"http://cairotechmap.com\">Cairo Tech Map</a>).\n\n5. <a href=\"/u/iriedawta\">@Iriedawta</a>\u00a0is considering taking the lead on driving \\#LOTE5\n\n6. Something was decided (I think) about community calls and how to manage the different expectations? If someone wants to see a community call next week, they are encouraged to craft an invitation to the community and post it in <a href=\"/en/events\">events</a>\u00a0and then update the Community News Calendar. Please do this a couple of days in advance so we can get word out to everyone in time.\n\n7. We should figure out how to use the mailing list less frequently and mostly when we are working towards events like LOTE5. Otherwise we both risk undermining engagement on the platform and repetition. Moving forward we focus more on using social media \u00a0and engagement on the platform better.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-21 13:20:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:01.008640", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 343, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [19812], "is_liked_by": [1856, 2580, 2201, 2551], "is_private": false}, {"id": 56241, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 10243, "post_number": 11, "raw": "Hey, no examples as of yet - just started developing them :)", "created_at": "2019-07-06 05:05:12.536386", "updated_at": "2019-07-06 05:05:12.536386", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 10, "wiki": false, "reads": 21, "score": 24.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [56089], "is_liked_by": [5209], "is_private": false}, {"id": 74737, "user_id": 3622, "topic_id": 13275, "post_number": 12, "raw": "A scheduled call needs a topic - like this: https://edgeryders.eu/t/virtual-shared-dinner/12876\n\nYou need to add an event date and RSVP a list of users:\n\n![56|534x690](upload://6GczbUATNTr486rEg5tDsxnpMdC.png) \n\nI was super busy on Monday @MariaEuler but I can walk through the steps and discuss the missing features with you tomorrow when you're available!", "created_at": "2020-04-21 12:48:51.139033", "updated_at": "2020-04-21 12:50:20.418888", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 60, "wiki": false, "reads": 27, "score": 30.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [74736], "is_liked_by": [4934], "is_private": false}, {"id": 45049, "user_id": 3362, "topic_id": 8653, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Perhaps you can do it in two steps.

In fact, I would say that intelligence is more of a tool that enables you to be successful rather than an ingredient itself. I have spent many years as a consultant, an advisor to venture funds, and advising numerous billionaires, serving as a Board Director and as an advisor to tech companies. I also have six children. Through these experiences, I have seen many things that help people succeed and many things that lead them to failure. However, the successes were all based on a single simple formula. Success is based on a convergence of three simple things:\n\n1. Do what you are passionate about. Without passion, your work is not your love and you can never be your best or be better than others who are running with their passion.\n\n2. Do something that you are inherently good or talented at. We all have our relative talents but spending your life doing something that is inherently more difficult puts you at a disadvantage to other more talented people.\n\n3. Do something that creates value and can be sold into a market present or future. Creating a widget that nobody but you wants may be self satisfying, but it certainly is not going to make you your fortune nor lead you to personal or professional success.\n\nNotice that money is not an ingredient in any of these factors nor is intelligence. Admittedly, higher intelligence makes some fields (maybe rockets for example) easier to learn, but by and large these ingredients are never a major factor in success. If you combine these three elements into your pursuits in life, you will be very successful and the money will come on its own. Money is a reflection of the true value that you are creating.\n\n- Jim Cantrell", "created_at": "2017-09-10 15:56:21.304890", "updated_at": "2017-09-10 15:56:57.810196", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 315, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 168.2, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 2464, 3762, 104], "is_private": false}, {"id": 72988, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 13016, "post_number": 11, "raw": "This was a choir.

As I was passionate about illustration, I started to work as an illustrator of children\u2019s books, while studying my specialty, which is something that I am still passionate about and working on until this moment. (Children\u2019s books in the Arab world aren\u2019t that developed as they are still discovering it, and I do feel the urge to enhance its quality for that I am still working on, even in foreign Arab countries)\n\nAfter graduation, I begin my master in art and communication while studying special effect and animation, and to develop more my knowledge, I started working in an audio-visual production for a year. Then I became an assistant in the University of fine art, and the higher Institute of Arts and Multimedia for three years. \n\nHowever, I wanted to develop more on my skills and researches for that I became a freelance designer to be able to start my PhD research.\n\nAs the revolution happened, the youth movement in Tunisia has completely changed and turned into an active one that wants to be involved in all sort of activities and discover as much as they could. So, as a designer, I felt that I had a certain responsibility to take part of creating a new ecosystem in the country that will include art, and use it as a tool to build a better future, and not consider it as just something fun to do. For that, I chose the subject of the contribution of designer in the new militant practices in Tunisia. \n\nMy point is, the youth are using the social media and they managed to create a certain power that can put pressure on the government (in our case, it made a whole revolution) , so we should reconsider the role of a  designer who is a professional in such tools, in this society. We should rethink their roles as they can be a symbol of resiliency and innovation. And this was a turning point for me, where I started to participate in different research programs that are based on the youth in Tunisia and the MENA region (such as Sahwa, GDRI\u2026) where we made different studies through focus groups, interviews\u2026 in different regions in Tunisia. The latter, helped me to discover new aspects of the youth of my country and allowed me to have a larger important network.\n\nWhat I concluded is that the youth are trying hard to change the current situation of the country into a better one. However, they are not finding a suitable ecosystem that can match their ambitions and expectations. And in order to change that, I took part in different civil society organizations, that focus on education of children and mainly those in need, where we created a system that provides a certain financial and psychological stability for them. We want to prepare them to be as the promising next generation.\n\nOne of my favorite, enriching experience is working as a responsible for creative workshops in ergotherapy in the department of Forensic Medicine at Errazi Psychiatric Hospital, where I litteraly dealt and worked with people who have serious psychiatric issues ( Some of them killed their families, or trying to kill themselves all the time\u2026 ), my job was to make them see things from an artistic point of view, through giving them different exercises that will help them gain self-confidence and stability. Also, I focused on their communication skills and worked on developing it through different artistic activities, to help them get over their depression. My best part was the result, where we, actually, where impressed with what they turned into, and the fact that, when we started doing this they were refusing it, but then they became interested in it, and wanted to do this all the time, that they will be upset if I don\u2019t come for a week! \n\nSo, for now, I am still as curious as I always was to learn more, I want to know more people who are trying innovative solutions to resolve the current crisis, new ways to animate the society and mainly the \u201cforgotten\u201d regions, and be part of creating a whole, new active ecosystem that will include art and design in its cores, and not just something aside seen as a unimportant activity.", "created_at": "2017-09-26 22:29:59.906413", "updated_at": "2017-09-28 10:33:37.211350", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 738, "wiki": false, "reads": 33, "score": 556.6, "like_count": 8, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3769, 454, 3812, 3789, 3703, 1935, 1543, 3904], "is_private": false}, {"id": 65507, "user_id": 5852, "topic_id": 11837, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Mohanned Ben nsib, passionte about hacking and development.\nMelk Bouzidi, passionate about robotics and entrepreneurship .\nAhmed Khemiri, passionate robotics and game development.\n\n** Major problem\nThe planet is dying and we're not doing enough to prevent that, it's not because we're not aware enough of it, but because we're not motivated enough to do it, for us it's not worth sacrificing our time and daily-life responsibilities to take care of it.\n\n** Our idea\nThis mobile application supported by artificial intelligence relies on trading needs between the user and the company hosting it.

We want to ensure that every participant leaves the venue having presented and discussed their work with others who can provide meaningful input or connect them with opportunities to further their professional and or personal development. If this appeals to you, then we would love to have you join us. Just [create an edgeryders account](https://communities.edgeryders.eu/login) and [introduce yourself to the community here](https://edgeryders.eu/c/wellbeing/cz).\n\n### How is this event being organised?\n\nThis event, and the festival it is part of, is coordinated on the edgeryders platform (where you are now) and co-curated through a series of community video calls. We have allocated a collaboratively managed budget for the festival and operate on a solidarity basis. Participants who need some financial support to organise or be able to participate in the festival are eligible provided they contribute towards making it a meaningful and generative experience for all - in the run up to, during and/or after the event. If you would like to join us but are unsure as to how to contribute, don\u2019t worry.

It is true we do have certain priveledges in Sweden, like free university education and it has been very important to me as I poinbted out in a nother mission report I wrote. I know the uncertainty\u00a0 that comes not having enough money for rent. But also the uncertainty of war. And then there are the coincidences, you happen to be in a good place at the right time.

Find somewhere cheap to live. Like really really cheap. Keep your costs very low, find ways to share expenses with others. To this day I am shocked when I find out what people spend money on. Things like cars etc. Total madness as far as Im concerned. If there is an event I know people I am interested in are going to go to I volunteer to help with it, or find a way to fund the trip. If there are rules, and they\u00b4re stupid I\u00b4ll question them by proposing better alternatives. Alot of times I\u00b4ve found that there is a wierd consensus and no one wanted to rock the boat, if you just ask that goes a long way.

Second big group is above 21 young people, that don`t believe that they vote makes difference.\n\nThat`s why we chose <strong>information campaign</strong> as instrument for changing voting pattern. We involved famous Ukrainian artists (you may know only Ruslana among them). We make a 1 minuets video in what this celebrities tell 2 straight messages: voting is important: \"so if you might not go - change your decision. Because every vote make a count. I go voting because it`s right &amp; cool\" ; politics make more for target groups that voting better: \"so it`s in some way even dosen`t meter if you`re candidate lose. Candidate that win will do more for your target group if this age group will be active\". We share this videous trogh social media, information web cites. Some TV`s take our video`s as a social advertising before elections.\n\nAlso we use MEM`s in social media, introducing this idea on TV &amp; Radio programs.

This is very interesting. Are you aware on how many women asked to talk? Because if this is also between 3.8% +- 0.5 % I would say that things went as they should have. I suppose there are other topics you would find women being more present then men. Education, for example.\n\nFor what is worth, in all the eDemocracy system that I code I make a point to make sure proposals presented are always anonymous at the moment of voting. In this way the voter supports an idea, not a person. This to avoid any (even unconscious) bias they might have. It is actually quite interesting after the vote, when people discover who wrote the idea they voted for, to see people's reaction. What is interesting is that some time people discover they are supporting the idea of a person they did not like. This usually force them to reconsider the person (in the light of their previous evaluation of the idea).\n\nI saw in another post you discussed how women seem to be able at comunicating and using web 2.0 discussion software, while men seem to be better and more interested in coding it. It looks to me like we are integrating and complementing each other very well.\u00a0\n\nI have a suggestion to make. In the last several years I have participated in a group called metagovernment. And yes we were mostly men (I only remember two women). But most people participating there are invited not just to discuss slution but also to code their talk. Now women can be very good coders. The NASA in fact prefers them to men, as they are less lightly to pull an all nighty, with the result of a more bug free code (when a bug can kill people this becomes very important). But matter of fact, women coders are rare. Very rare. My experience is that women find coding booring. And prefer human relations. Why could someone find a flesh and blood human being more interesting than a computer code is beyond me to understand ;-) . But this is what I have observed. (P.S. I am only half joking, after all the computer code CAN change the World more than most human beings).\n\nBTW, those differences starts quite young. Kids at 4 when you ask them to complete the phrase \"I play with\" add the name of a person if they are girls (I play with Sue, I play with Sara) and the name of a toy (I play with the ball, I play with LEGO) if they are boys. We are different.\n\nSo I think it is just natural that, in an historical stage where people are coding the possible solutions, people who do not like coding will be less present.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-11 16:54:34", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:12.750538", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 495, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 76472, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 13405, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Yes, this is great.", "created_at": "2020-05-13 13:13:16.383057", "updated_at": "2020-05-13 13:13:16.383057", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 22.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [76471], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 73310, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 13080, "post_number": 4, "raw": "I have never been in a single Jitsi call that deserved the name.

Wow.  I had to really take time to read and digest it.  I still have to dig through the footnotes. He really had a well-calibrated crystal ball.  So much of what he describes is still with us, if not in specific products per se, certainly in the privatizing of surveillance that so often then services state-sanctioned goals, or tilts elections (Citizen United and Facebook).  When it comes to gathering data about Net users, that horse is definitely out of the barn, with Facebook and Amazon and Google now for years knowing more about us than we ever would have allowed the state to know.  Sometimes states have some trouble getting their hands on those mountains of surveillance data, but I think not really all that much trouble.  We ended up handing it all to them anyway.  Boyle saw it coming.  And of course with unified state and technology like in China, it seems pretty complete. Or at least the most complete surveillance state we've yet seen.  But then of course London is no slouch with cameras everywhere.  Which ones are private and which ones are state?  Do they share everything?  How would we even know?\n\nSo Boyle really nailed it.  you know, as much as I liked and admired Barlow, I never really thought his vision of cyberspace was going to hold for all that long.  I remember when he wrote that I had already seen plenty of smart tech guys who were not libertarians in any way, with no interest at all in any counterculture, and would be more than happy to do what the state, a corporation, a startup or a rich guy asked if they met the right price.\n\nAnd you describe a difference in EU and US culture - no direct involvement in free speech (outside of libel, yelling fire in a theater, etc) in the US, but plenty of interest in regulating morality on children. Definitely a stronger nanny state over here that way.  And while there are some hate speech laws, they have pretty high standards for what you have to do to actually get busted for saying something.  American culture really won't stand for much curtailing what adults can say to each other.  \n\nOne point about the Stewart Brand quote..you probably know this, but Boyle doesn't mention it, or if he did I missed it, but the whole quote is, \"information wants to be expensive, information wants to be free.\"  He was good at pithy lines. He also came up with \"you own your own words\" as the WELL policy for IP/copyright.  And we debated that endlessly too.\n\nAnother thought is that (I think) the essay describes how the overt, declared structure and hierarchy of sovereignty hides a number of powerfully influential and even determining factors that are either hidden or outsourced so they take on a benign appearance, or one that a consumer willingly trades off for some perceived benefit (free services for example).  \n\nI think another way that might play out is via what I would call national conceit.  The USA was founded on, and in principle is governed by, high ideals. We are taught in school to revere them as a national religion.  This powerful force carries with it a stifling effect against criticism that questions whether or not we really live up bedrock ideas.  (As MLK said, \"I have a dream that one day this nation will live out the full meaning of its creed.\")  I mention Vietnam because those who perpetrated and supported that war would not allow the pointed critiques to have any influence became forceful to the point of shooting kids who opposed the war strongly enough, as at Kent State, even while hiding the real story from the people who sent their kids over there. I think America has still not completely atoned for its embrace of that war. Same with Iraq.  Anyway, this is about how national conceit can provide cover for similar insidious developments that inhibit life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

The cliques like the one highlighted in blue are induced by a single, dense post which is coded with 5-10 codes, which then, by definition, form a clique. On the other hand, the fact that the graph is connected (all nodes in the same in connected component) is not artifact of SSNA. The graph that has a more meaningful interpretation is the second one, where only the edges between codes that co-occur at least twice are preserved. \n\n[quote=\"amelia, post:1, topic:11320\"]\ncommunity members find an underlying tension between acknowledging the ecological costs of the tech industry and findings ways to develop technological tools to protect the climate.

Clinical doctors are not scientists: they have a different lineage. Their commitment is not to vanquishing the ilness, but to the well-being of the *patient*.  This entails navigating the exact same trade-offs that Zimmermann talks about here. You see this very well in the COVID-19 debate: epidemiologists tend to be closer to the science side of things. They build and interpret models, do statistics and so on. Their recommendations optimize for indicators like caseload, hospitalizations and so on. Infectivologists are closer to clinical practice, and they tend to strike a balance across many different factors, some of them having nothing to do with medicine and health. I was very impressed by [an interview with Johan Giesecke](https://youtu.be/bfN2JWifLCY) (thanks @hugi for sharing it), who started out as an infectivologist and ended up becoming Sweden's main epidemiologist. He talks a lot about democracy and economic well-being, you can hear him navigate the tradeoffs as he speaks. \n\nThe parallel with medicine is also interesting in that clinical doctors consider \"evidence\" things that are very different from the \"evidence\" of their research colleagues. This is fundamental: medical research deals in statistics. It tells you that, in the trial of new drug X, 70% of the people in the treatment group experienced a body weight loss of  3% or more, against only 24% in the control group. What it does not tell you is if drug X will help *this patient in particular, right now,* get better. @markomanka once told him that technologists treat medicine as if it consisted only of diagnosis: once you get the diagnosis right, the treatment protocol follows. This is completely false (\"my diabetes is not like your diabetes\"). What's more, it will *always* be false, because human health is so multidimensional that statistical reasoning can never \"see\" the individual case. You would need clinical trials with the whole human population! \n\nAnd this bring me to the topic, dear to me, of data. \n\n[quote=\"Leonie, post:1, topic:13438\"]\nSo, whatever new data gets fed back into our algorithmic model will reflect those inequalities in our status quo to some extent.\n[/quote]\n\nThis is true. \"Data\" are translations of messy reality into a formal structure, operated by biased, overworked, careless, unreliable humans. And that is in the best case scenario. We, however do not live in the best case scenario: we live in a scenario where major governments will tell you, with a straight face, things like \"today we report 325 COVID-19 deaths. Of these, 87 happened yesterday in the country's hospitals; 238 happened in retirement homes, between yesterday and last Tuesday, sorry, there were delays in collecting the data. Ah, and of the people that died in the retirement homes 37% tested positive for  COVID, we did not test the others\".\n\nIn a situation like this, you do not \"crunch\" the data. You circle them like you would do with a dangerous quicksand pit. You poke at them with a stick, assume they are unreliable and try to determine how unreliable they are. What you don't do is feed them to a model, happily publish the result (with the obligatory sprinkling of dubitative expressions) and then protest \"but these are the only data we have!\" when called out.\n\n[quote=\"Leonie, post:1, topic:13438\"]\n\u201cwell, optimising isn\u2019t everything\u201d\n[/quote]\n\nSure. But ML *does* optimize. If it does not optimize, it's not ML. \n\nIntuitively, I do not see how narrow AI could be a credible candidate method for making decisions.

We need some advice. We can also offer some freelance work to the right person with hands-on experience of SSO implementation to help development. We are working on a project that will help grassroots organizations collaborate on running and maintaining buildings, creative communities and parks. It\u2019s a mostly open source set of tools split up into three web apps.\n\nWe have two web apps (both with GraphQL APIs and React/Apollo frontends). Both of these apps are built to be multi-tenant, with each tenant having its own set of users and a separate domain. We now want to build a Single Sign-on solution that allows users to log in to both of these apps with the same account. We also want to build a dashboard that allows organization admins to administrate user roles and permissions for their organization.\n\nWe are currently comparing two possible solutions. One is to use Auth0, and the other is to run Keycloak. Furthermore, we are open to other options.\n\n**Some requirements:**\n\n* In the first two years, we are expecting at most a couple of hundred organizations, with an average of 50 users each. However, the solutions should be able to scale to thousands of organizations.\n* It is important that the SSO server has ready-made connections to social identity providers like Google.\n* It is important that there are well-documented cases of using the SSO solution with Swedish BankID authentication (https://www.bankid.com/en/)\n* We want the ways of authentication (username and password, social, BankId) to be set by us individually for each tenant depending on the use case. Some will only want passwords as usernames while others will want social authentication with Google or official identity with BankID.\n* We need to be able to have our custom interface for the SSO page\n* Preferably, we want to be able to use different SSO page designs for each tenant.\n* These applications are open-source, so the ease of setup for community developers is a factor.\n\nFactors to consider:\n\n* We do not want to be locked in by Auth0, but we also don\u2019t want to become bogged down in early development by having to implement everything ourselves.\n* Users will be dormant for most of the year, logging in often for 3 months and logging in quite rarely for the rest of the year.\n* Price is a factor, and we want to compare the subscription cost of Auth0 to the estimated cost of setting up, configuring, and running Keycloak and developing any required integrations. Since Auth0 also needs some configuration, this should be taken into account.\n* Generally speaking, we would accept the 0.25 USD fee incurred per user for Auth0 if the work and effort saved by using Auth0 are considerable. This also means that if we can instead use the same amount to pay our team, that would be preferable.\n\nSome illustrations on our architecture. Note that the dashboard has dashed lines and arrows. That\u2019s because we might not need to build it ourselves if there is a way to give org admins restricted access to Keycloak to set roles.\n\n![image|690x647](upload://8xYW1Wr4dPdCqFLKuFeMlpFhyyf.png) ![image|690x506](upload://l2Tzr8V6qvNnZaYfKLO4EYoDqD0.png)", "created_at": "2020-10-04 13:35:28.843200", "updated_at": "2020-10-05 12:10:46.128009", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 540, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 153.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 59291, "user_id": 5025, "topic_id": 9881, "post_number": 50, "raw": "1.

These tools include [Dreams ](https://dreams.wtf/), [Realities ](http://realities.theborderland.se/graph), [Graphryder ](https://graphryder1.edgeryders.eu/), [Open Ethnographer](https://edgeryders.eu/t/open-ethnographer-manual/6811), and Discourse (this forum). We will integrate all of these tools with each other, allow them to share data, and enable a single login to all of them through the account a user has on the forum.\n> \n> We will use this suite of tools to activate Frihamnstorget, to map out the different projects and their budgets, map out the different responsibilities and their dependencies, document contacts with authorities and build a great community. Frihamnstorget will get its own Dreams platform, Realities platform and the conversations on the forum will be visualized in a graph showing the connections between people, ideas and projects. We use this forum as the starting point and all platforms will integrate with the forum through a single login.\n\nA part of Plato is running a demonstration of the tools at Frihamnstorget and Blivande. We are taking this opportunity to level up the methodological toolbox of Edgeryders and invest in valuable skills. As a part of this, we have decided that our own @MariaEuler will do both community management and ethnography in the Plato project and that she will be trained and mentored by @amelia, who will act as \"senior ethnographer\" in the project. Since the Plato project will use the entire Blivande community as its testbed, we will come out with an ethnography and SSNA graph of the Blivande community as a whole.\n\nThis ethnography workpackage in Plato will result in many good things for Edgeryders and the ResNet:\n\n* We level up the capacity for in-house ethnography through @MariaEuler \n* We get another SSNA graph to show clients\n* We can test the hypothesis of combining community management and ethnography leading to better results on both ends\n* We develop deep knowledge of how to use SSNA for a pre-existing community, rather than one built specifically for the purpose of a project\n\nIn addition to all of this, there is 10k EUR in the project earmarked to work on improving our SSNA technology. That work in the Plato project starts in early 2021, and until then I think that we will have made some headway into building a realtime representation of Discourse in RedisGraph.", "created_at": "2020-04-02 17:21:56.815612", "updated_at": "2020-04-21 11:27:24.279630", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 454, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 158.0, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4934, 2915, 3323, 4, 5, 6406], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31425, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3701, "post_number": 18, "raw": "<b>Great idea! </b>\n\nGreat idea indeed.

She is a girl, I am a boy. We are pretty much the same age and from the discussion we had we seem to share some common views on the things around us.<span>\u00a0</span>She invited me to join you guys on Sunday and to tell you what vegetables to bring.\u00a0\n\n<span>We both speak Romanian.</span>\n\nShe asked me to share with you guys some things about me and what I do these days. I don't know what this has to do with vegetables. But, she is pretty amazing and knows her way around, so I will just go with it.\u00a0\n\nIn the part of the life outside my shelter I play different roles: student, IT guy, volunteer. Student means I go to a course for young managers, IT means I do cool landing pages (ok, I did just one and some people like it, just selling it) and volunteer means I help some guys launch a volunteering platform (going pretty slow, I don't think that we actually know what we are doing).\n\nI am on bootstrap mode and that brings me to the thing I really like to do lately. I enjoy buying vegetables, cook them and eat what I've cooked. I like it a lot most of the times, other people eat it too\u00a0<span>sometimes\u00a0</span>and it happens inside my shelter. I always start with onions, garlic and ginger and the recipes are pretty much on the spot. It is pleasure of mine to use curry, but I can do without.\u00a0\n\nSo here is my proposal for Sunday: we seen to be all into the sharing economy and using the leftovers, so I invite you to bring whatever vegetables you have in the fridge. They don't need to be beautiful, just okeish. Also, don't bring too many, is Sunday evening, we are in Bucharest, we will not starve. We will place all the vegetables on the table and see if there's any magic there. I have been doing this for 6 (yes six)\u00a0months, so just trust me I am the expert.\u00a0\n\nLet me give you some pointers. Is the season of Romanian zucchini. You can buy one for 1 Leu if the fridge is empty. Also the Romanian tomatoes taste pretty amazing now. Eggs not, but maybe Eggplants. I was thinking about eggs and cheese, but where's the challenge, then? Remember, not too many we are in Bucharest, we will not starve. I will take care of the onions, garlic, ginger, olive oil, rice/pita (we can have both depending on what we'll cook). What is left we can take back home.\u00a0\n\nSo that's that. What do you think?

Spreadsheet (i.e. database-like) documentation encodes the world view of the person designing the database (i.e. creating an naming the columns). \"Internal/external\" and \"how to/materials\" may seem obvious to you, but obscure to someone else. The instructable format assumes that the reader has no idea what the writer is talking about, so the latter needs to make an effort to take no prior knowledge for granted. The additional advantage of a good instructable is that it becomes another part of the digital commons: people outside ER can use it too. \n\nI like your idea of dividing the work into phases, it's quite natural.

Making a Discourse multisite installation</h2>\n\nDiscourse supports multisite installations out of the box. However, we made some changes and fixes and provide our code in the [multisite branch of edgeryders/discourse](https://github.com/edgeryders/discourse/tree/multisite/).\n\nBy installing from that codebase, you will get the same multisite setup that we use. We will regularly update this branch to the most recent state (HEAD) from discourse/discourse, but only do this about every 3-12 months.\n\nWe did not follow the default Discourse installation instructions (which are about a Docker image and Nginx) but rather use a Discourse + Apache 2 + SSL setup without Docker. Good hints to achieve that are:\n\n* [Discourse without Docker](https://bcarlin.net/blog/discourse-without-docker.html)\n* [Rails Server with Apache + Puma (via reverse proxy)](https://www.learnwithdaniel.com/2015/01/apache-puma-via-reverse-proxy/)\n* [HOWTO setup Discourse with Let\u2019s Encrypt and Apache SSL](https://meta.discourse.org/t/46139)\n\n_[TODO: Detailed installation instructions.]_\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2. Adding a Discourse site to the multisite setup</h2>\n\nThese are generic instructions for adding one Discourse platform to the multisite setup \u2013 it does not matter whether you later configure it to [be your SSO provider](#heading--3) or to [be a federated forum](#heading--4).\n\nThe following instructions assume you use Apache 2 as your webserver.\n\n1. Point the domain to the server with your Discourse installation.\n\n2. Create a new website record in your Apache 2 configuration, and include the following into the VirtualHost config. It provides the proxy server configuration for Apache 2 to forward to Puma (the Rails server providing Discourse on an internal port), with exceptions for static files etc. that should be served by Apache directly.\n\n    ```apache\n    RewriteEngine On\n    RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off\n    RewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [NE]\n    \n    DocumentRoot /home/discourse/production_multisite/current/public\n    \n    <Directory /home/discourse/production_multisite/current/public>\n      Options +FollowSymLinks\n      AllowOverride All\n      Require all granted\n    </Directory>\n    \n    <location /assets>\n      ProxyPass !\n    </location>\n    \n    <location /system>\n     ProxyPass !\n    </location>\n    \n    <location /images>\n      ProxyPass !\n   </location>\n\n    <location /javascripts>\n      ProxyPass !\n    </location>\n\n    # IMPORTANT IMPORTANT IMPORTANT\n    # Replace \"sitename\" with the folder containing this \n    # multisite's uploads. Excepting all of /uploads is impossible \n    # as some URLs inside must be served by Discourse.\n    <location /uploads/sitename>\n      ProxyPass !\n    </location>\n\n    # Do not proxy the Alias URL needed for LetsEncrypt \n    # certificate generation.\n    ProxyPass /.well-known/acme-challenge !\n    \n    # Proxying Discourse requests to Puma.\n    ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:9294/\n    ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:9294/\n    \n    # Assure Discourse it is on HTTPS.\n    # Else the Discourse setting \"force https\" fails.\n    RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto \"https\"\n    ```\n\n3. Enable a redirection from the `www` subdomain to the naked domain.\n\n4. Add the multisite to `/home/discourse/production_multisite/shared/config/multisite.yml`\n\n5. Create the database (supply your database name suffix for `sitename`):\n\n    ```\n    createdb discourse_production_sitename -U discourse\n    ```\n\n6. Migrate the database (supply the correct database name at `RAILS_DB=\u2026`):\n\n    ```\n    cd /home/discourse/production_multisite/current; \n    RAILS_DB=\u2026 bundle exec rails db:migrate['multisite']`;\n    ```\n\n7. Restart puma:\n\n    ```\n    sudo monit restart puma_discourse_multisite_production\n    ```\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--3\">3. Configuring a Discourse site to be the default site</h2>\n\nEach Discourse multisite installation has one \"default\" site. This is only relevant for Sidekiq: unlike in \"normal\" Discourse installations, the Sidekiq queue in a multisite installation processes the tasks of _all_ sites in the multisite group.\n\nDue to this, it should only be accessible to the server administrator and not to any Discourse administrator of any one Discourse site of the multisite group. To achieve this, Sidekiq looks at the servername of the Discourse server process and only grants a Discourse administator access to `/sidekiq` if that is the same as the servername used to access Discourse. This servername is that of the \"default\" site of a Discourse multisite set.\n\nWe propose to configure one Discourse multisite site with the sole purpose of providing access to this `/sidekiq` URL, as follows:\n\n1. Mark this site of the multisite set as the default one in the Discourse configuration. _[TODO: How to do that.]_\n\n2. In the site's Apache Virtualhost configuration file provided above, change the proxy exception for uploaded images to be as follows:\n    ```apache\n    <location /uploads/default>\n      ProxyPass !\n    </location>\n    ````\n\n3. In the site's Apache Virtualhost configuration file provided above, change the proxy server forwarding to use the domain name (example.com) of the default site instead of `127.0.0.1`, as follows:\n\n    ```apache\n    ProxyPass / http://example.com:9294/\n    ProxyPassReverse / http://example.com:9294/\n    ```\n\n    This type of forwarding is obviously slower as it goes via the Internet rather than the local loop interface for `127.0.0.1`, but as the default site is only used to access the Sidelkiq interface it does not matter here.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--4\">4. Configuring a Discourse site to be the SSO provider</h2>\n\nThe Discourse multisite system just means \"one codebase, one process set, multiple databases\". All Discourse platforms in a multisite set are completely independent and can use their own login and signup mechanism. Using SSO (single-sign-on) is completely optional when using a Discourse multisite setup \u2013 we chose to do so as part of our federated Discourse hosting.\n\nOut of the box, Discourse can be configured to be either the SSO provider or an SSO client for the single-sign-on mechanism. In our setup, one of the Discourse multisite platforms is the SSO provider and all others are SSO clients.\n\nWe configured [communities.edgeryders.eu](https://communities.edgeryders.eu/) to be the SSO provider and called it the \"Edgeryders Communities Login Site\". Putting it on a subdomain of our main platform edgeryders.eu is meant to create the least amount of confusion for the bulk of users compared to a process where they would _all_ be forwarded to another domain for login.\n\nWe made the following adaptations to let Discourse work as a SSO provider without much friction:\n\n1. Configure Discourse as SSO provider in the Discourse admin interface under \"\u2630 \u2192 Admin \u2192 Settings\":\n    * Login \u2192 enable sso: false\n(:warning: _This setting must only be enabled if you want Discourse to act as the SSO client._)\n    * Login \u2192 enable sso provider: true\n    * Login \u2192 sso secret: _(put in a random passphrase string)_\n\n2. Hide everything of the Discourse user interface for non-staff users (using theme CSS overwrites) except the following:\n    * user menu \u2192 Edit Profile\n    * user menu \u2192 Logout\n\n3. Put in prominent links to the manual for help with signup, login and site usage. In our case we have a top navbar link (with yellow background) to [signup help](https://edgeryders.eu/t/6463#heading--1-1) and a link in the hamburger menu to the whole manual.\n\n4. Create a topic that users will see at the end of the signup process, with the following information:\n    * A message \"You have successfully activated your account and logged in.\"\n    * A call to action: \"Return to the community you want to join\"\n    * A list of the federated Discourse websites where users can go back to, with icons and links leading to https://example.com/login . Using that link target instead of https://example.com/ will automatically log in users when they return to the site where they started the signup process.\n    * An explanation of what the login site is for.\n\n5. Set the topic that should be visible at the end of the signup process as a \"global banner topic\". This will make it visible, given that you have hidden all Discourse content by CSS.\n\n6. Hide the \"close\" button of the banner topic by CSS, to make sure it will always be visible to all logged-in users.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--5\">5. Configuring a Discourse site to be a federated forum</h2>\n\nThese tasks are mostly specific to the [Edgeryders Communities platforms](/t/id/7419), a hosting offer of federated Discourse platforms by Edgeryders O\u00dc.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--5-1\">5.1. Set the SSO secret</h3>\n\n1. Get the current value of the SSO secret from an existing Discourse website that you configured as a federated Discourse platform (so _not_ from your SSO provider), by looking at: https://example.com/admin/site_settings/category/all_results?filter=sso\n\n2. Set the SSO secret as follows. First, enter Rails console (supply your database name for `discourse_production_sitename`):\n\n    ```bash\n    cd /home/discourse/production_multisite/current; \n    RAILS_DB=discourse_production_sitename RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails c\n    ```\n\n    Inside Rails console, execute this command (supply your SSO secret for `sso_secret`):\n\n    ```ruby\n    SiteSetting.create!(name: 'sso_secret', data_type: 1, value: \"sso_secret\")\n    ```\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--5-2\">5.2. Make the basic configuration settings</h3>\n\nIf you use our codebase, most of these settings will already be done (and in addition, useful defaults will be provided for other Discourse settings) via our [plugin EdgerydersMultisite](https://github.com/edgeryders/discourse/tree/multisite/plugins/edgeryders-multisite).\n\nOtherwise, you can make the settings manually:\n\n1. Run the setup wizard by visiting https://example.com/wizard\n\n2. Upload logos and favicons, either as part of the setup wizard or by visiting at any later time https://example.com/wizard/steps/logos\n\n3. Make the following settings in the Discourse admin interface under \"\u2630 \u2192 Admin \u2192 Settings\". (These are essential for the login mechanism and external user profile mechanism to work properly.)\n\n    * Users \u2192 Email editable: false\n    * Security \u2192 Force Https: true\n    * Login \u2192 enable_sso: true\n    * Login \u2192 sso overrides email: true\n    * Login \u2192 sso overrides username: true\n    * Login \u2192 sso overrides avatar: true\n    * Login \u2192 sso overrides profile background: true\n    * Login \u2192 sso overrides card background: true\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--5-3\">5.3. Add the site to the federation menu</h3>\n\nWe created a custom [plugin EdgerydersCommunitiesNavigation](https://github.com/edgeryders/discourse/tree/multisite/plugins/edgeryders-communities-navigation) that provides the top-right \"Communities\" menu, linking all our federated Discourse platforms together. To add the new site:\n\n1. Add a new menu entry in [file edgeryders_communities_navigation.hbs](https://github.com/edgeryders/discourse/blob/multisite/plugins/edgeryders-communities-navigation/assets/javascripts/discourse/templates/connectors/above-site-header/edgeryders_communities_navigation.hbs).\n\n2. Deploy the code. This will change the top-right federation menu on all sites of the Discourse multisite group at once.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--5-4\">5.4. Creating a site contact user</h3>\n\nIn the recent versions of Discourse, the `system` user can no longer be renamed, but you can (and should) configure in setting \"site contact username\" that a different user account is used by the software to send messages etc..\n\nWe have a convention that this new user should be named after the platform \u2013 for example, user @edgeryders in the case of this platform. That makes it a natural choice for the author of the Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, various menu pages and other official content of a Discourse platform. Even though this user is not meant to be used for login, content can be transferred to it using the admin feature \"Change Ownership \u2026\".\n\nHere is how to create and maintain such a user account for one specific Edgeryders Communities platform (the \"target platform\"):\n\n1. Create a new user account on communities.edgeryders.eu using:\n\n    * the target platform's name as the username\n    * a fictive e-mail address that belongs to the target platform's domain \u2013 for example, `noreply@edgeryders.eu` in the case of this platform\n    * a password that you won't remember. as it will never be needed\n\n2. Log in as an admin user on communities.edgeryders.eu.\n\n3. Go to \"[Admin \u2192 Users \u2192 New](https://communities.edgeryders.eu/admin/users/list/new)\", select the user account you just created, and click <kbd>Activate Account</kbd>. This verifies the non-existing e-mail address.\n\n4. Click <kbd>Impersonate</kbd>.\n\n5. Upload the platform logo as the user's profile image.\n\n6. Go to the target platform and click \"Log in\", to create an account with the same username there and sync the profile image.\n\n7. Log in with an admin account on the target platform and make the new user a moderator. This will indicate it is an \"official\" account. (Do not make it admin, as that is not shown in the frontend anyway but would be more dangerous in case the account is ever compromised or somebody gets access to the \"non-existing e-mail address\".)\n\n8. Set the Discourse setting \"site contact username\" to that user, which makes it take over most roles of the `system` user.\n\nIf you ever have to adapt the username or profile picture of this special user, do so by logging in as admin on communities.edgeryders.eu and impersonating that user. (Re-)log in to the target platform as that user afterwards to sync the changes to that platform. Since we use SSO, username, e-mail address and profile picture cannot be changed at all on Edgeryders Communities platforms directly, not even by admins.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--5-5\">5.5. Provide Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, FAQ</h3>\n\nThe FAQ is a stub document that will grow to be different for each Edgeryders Communities platform. The others are legal agreements that are identical for all sites.

I was reading this very personal reflection on work and it seems like something you could draw inspiration from, for when you'll need to start framing the problem you wanna solve:\n\n\"<span>It was not till I was in college that the idea of work finally broke free from the idea of making a living. Then the important question became not how to make money, but what to work on. Ideally these coincided, but some spectacular boundary cases (like Einstein in the patent office) proved they weren't identical.\n\nThe definition of work was now to make some original contribution to the world, and in the process not to starve. But after the habit of so many years my idea of work still included a large component of pain. Work still seemed to require discipline, because only hard problems yielded grand results, and hard problems couldn't literally be fun. Surely one had to force oneself to work on them.\n\nIf you think something's supposed to hurt, you're less likely to notice if you're doing it wrong. That about sums up my experience of graduate school.\n\nHow much\u00a0are you supposed to like what you do? Unless you know that, you don't know when to stop searching. And if, like most people, you underestimate it, you'll tend to stop searching too early. You'll end up doing something chosen for you by your parents, or the desire to make money, or prestige\u2014or sheer inertia.\n\nHere's an upper bound: Do what you love doesn't mean, do what you would like to do most\u00a0this second. Even Einstein probably had moments when he wanted to have a cup of coffee, but told himself he ought to finish what he was working on first.\" -\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html\">http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html</a></span>\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-22 07:13:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:00.017774", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 384, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1877], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62783, "user_id": 5539, "topic_id": 11337, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hello everyone,\n\nThis is Mohamed Elewa. from Cairo, Egypt and I\u2019m here to Organize \u201cHack 4 Environment\u201d Hackathon in Egypt.\n\nI have +5 years\u2019 experience in Business Development and Digital Projects Management.

Thousands of hackers, technology freaks, artists and utopians get together for five days in the Brandenburg summer \u2013 to communicate, learn, hack and party together.\n\nWe focus on topics such as information technology, digital security, hacking, crafting, making and breaking, and we engage in creative, sceptical discourse on the interaction between technology and society.\n\nWe\u2019d love to see your submission for these tracks:\n\n* Arts &amp; Culture,\n* Ethics, Society &amp; Politics,\n* Hardware &amp; Making,\n* Security &amp; Hacking,\n* Science.\n\nApart from the official conference program on the main stages, the Chaos Communication Camp also offers space for community villages, developer and project meetings, art installations, lightning talks and numerous workshops (called \u201cself-organized sessions\u201d).\n\n### Lightning talks\n\nGot something interesting to say but don\u2019t want to submit a full talk? Consider doing a lightning talk instead! You will have five minutes to present your ideas or projects \u2013 or just to rant, if you need to vent. A formal submission through our submission system (called \u201efrab\u201c) is not required; as usual, the lightning talks are organized via our public wiki. Lightning talks can be held in German or English and will be streamed, recorded and published (see below).\n\nFor projects, installations, workshops, sessions hosted in assemblies and other fun stuff is no formal submission through frab required. There will be a wiki page to keep track of requirements for space and other resources. Simply start already considering now what you would like to make, bring, or show, and write it down once the wiki goes online.\n\n### Dates &amp; deadlines\n\n* May 22th, 2019: Call for Participation\n* June 11th, 2019 (23:59 CEST): Deadline for submissions\n* July 10th: Notification of acceptance\n* August 21st \u2013 25th, 2019: Chaos Communication Camp at [Ziegeleipark Mildenberg](http://www.ziegeleipark.de/index.html)\n\n### Submission guidelines for talks\n\nAll lectures need to be submitted to our conference planning system under the following URL: https://frab.cccv.de/cfp/camp2019.\n\nPlease follow the instructions there. If you have any questions regarding the submission, you are welcome to contact us via mail at camp2019-content@cccv.de.\n\nPlease send us a description of your suggested talk that is as complete as possible. The description is the central criterium for acceptance or rejection, so please ensure that it is as clear and complete as possible. Quality comes before quantity. Due to the non-commercial nature of the event, presentations which aim to market or promote commercial products or entities will be rejected without consideration.\n\nSince most participants find \u2013 or don\u2019t find a lecture by its title, it\u2019s important to keep your talk description precise, accessible and comprehensible. Our teams will keep a keen eye on title and subtitle and make suggestions to change them if necessary, so please avoid insider jokes and stereotypes.\n\nAs it is likely that there will be multiple submissions on the same topic, please show us exactly why your talk should be part of the conference. Remember that the teams are diversely staffed, and not every reviewer knows every submitter and their backgrounds. Please write something about yourself, your research, and your motivation. It does not matter if the talk has been held at another conference somewhere on this planet, as long as it is up to date and relevant.\n\nTalks should be 45 minutes long and can include up to 15 minutes for questions and answers. Longer slots are possible if absolutely necessary, but should be an exception. Please take our limited amount of presentation time into consideration, check how much time you really need to bring home your points and then tell us the proposed length of your talk.\n\n### Language\n\nAlthough the Chaos Communication Camp is an international event and a lot of content is presented in English, there will again be a translation team that will simultaneously translate most German talks into English. So if you are not comfortable with presenting in English, don\u2019t hesitate to present your lecture in German. If your talk will be held in English, your submission should also be in English.\n\n### Publication\n\nAudio and video recordings of the lectures will be published in various formats at [media.ccc.de](https://media.ccc.de/) under the license Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0). This license allows commercial use of excerpts by media institutions as part of their reporting. If you do not wish for material from your lecture to be published or streamed, please let us know in your submission.\n\nNote: As German law (and therefore the license) might differ from the law of your country, please let us know if you have any issues or questions regarding the exact implications. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t guarantee a perfect translation.\n\n### Travel, costs &amp; visa\n\nThe Chaos Communication Camp is a great adventure for us, also financially. As we\u2019re all there to have a nice time together, and split the costs, we cannot offer a different entrance fee for speakers, workshop organizers or angels. The camp is a non-commercial event where neither the organisers nor the speakers are being paid \u2013 thus, we cannot provide a free entrance ticket, even for speakers. If necessary, we are however able to provide limited support for travel costs.\n\nIf you need help applying for a visa, such as an official invitation to present to the German embassy, please let the content team know well in advance. Please be aware that the visa application procedure may take up to six weeks or longer!\n\n*Photo: Fabrizio, [CC BY-SA 2.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/).*", "created_at": "2019-05-22 19:56:15.388966", "updated_at": "2019-07-02 17:09:14.185487", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1158, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 529.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 4970], "is_private": false}, {"id": 57026, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 10385, "post_number": 6, "raw": "[quote=\"JollyOrc, post:5, topic:10385\"]\nI think that most people look for something slightly different here\u2026 and it still somehow works :slight_smile:\n[/quote]\n\nAmen to that.

For three days we come together to make sense of what our work means for groups and communities\u2019 well being, to figure out how to build and adapt ways of being and working together.\n\nThe role of each of you as session leaders, is to gently steer the conversation towards common aspirations and how we can collaborate around further insights and collective action. We aim to move away from panels of experts and \u2018knowledge transaction\u2019 to more generative ways of spending our time together that build on the expertise you bring and draw out experience from those attending.\n\n## Structure it\n\nKeep an eye on the final program to make sure the scheduling and time for your session work.\nYou own your time, but you are responsible for other people\u2019s time - for which we recommend you create a good balance between presentation and opening up for discussion. Give thought to how your session might work with different numbers of participants, especially when there are two other sessions being offered. How could you adapt your session to cope with low numbers or being over subscribed? Note that people vote with their feet: they will join the session on the spot.\n\n## Connect with a curator\n\nFrank @woodbinehealth, @gehan, @winnieponcelet are open to hearing your reflections before and after the session. If you don\u2019t have a plan for how you would like to break up the time you have - we\u2019re happy to support you to create one. We can also help you summarize your conversations to the larger group, and continue the conversations after.\n\n## Documentation Documentation Documentation\n\nSharing information and knowledge is what made OpenVillage possible, as well as any collaboration across our domains and countries. It is deeply ingrained in our culture and we ask everyone to be generous and do the following:\n\n**1. Session Notes**: in the beginning of the session, ask someone in the room to document what is being discussed. Make sure they upload the notes online, here: https://edgeryders.eu/c/festival\n\n**2. Contribute to harvesting**: a team of participants are thinking deeply about ways to collect and make sense of our collective conversation and the patterns that emerge. We might ask you to offer a short interview, or share thoughts with the bigger group at the end of the day, or fill out sheets onsite.\n\n**3. Twitter** is a great way for people to take notes on the fly during sessions and for those who cannot be there to participate. Consider livetweeting from the session using #openvillage.\n\n**4. Synthetise your reflections in a blog post**: The most thoughtful and generous thing you can do if you attended an edgeryders event is to write about it and post it here on the platform. Don\u2019t worry about getting it \u201cright\u201d, just let yourself be honest. \n\n##VENUES\nSome sessions happen in parallel, in 3 rooms. We will allocate them depending on the interest shown for each proposal on edgeryders.eu, or logistic needs.\n\nIf you have specific requirements let your curator know. Note that we will have projectors, chairs, tables which can be moved around, but we need to make do with a do-it-yourself space. Learn more.\n\nPlease be mindful of the next session and leave the room 10 minutes before your allocated time.\n\nEnjoy the learning!\n\n\n### Day 1 - La Serre \n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/0/03cbdfa0ea7a7119ee6ff8fced774bc60aa9e3e9.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\">\n_Main hall (holds 60+, no projectors due to natural light)_\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/76f7562f88c5bfdb168ef1b8bfe3dbab00ef49df.jpg\" width=\"517\" height=\"690\">\n_Darker room (holds up to 25, good for sessions which need projectors)_\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/4/4cfbabc22e475dc5d665fb61a2235ff2c258bdd0.jpg\" width=\"517\" height=\"690\">\n_The library room (holds up to 18-20, should work for sessions with/without projector)_\n\n\n### Day 2, Day 3 - Au Quai\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7b7d64f2b775f7f0b00f7e639441e6aba2153c75.png\" width=\"517\" height=\"690\">\n_Main hall base level(holds up to 100+, good for projecting; sitting on the floor with cushions, or on chairs)_\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/0/0620844c1fc3243935f2e72f7374150fa29af256.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"517\">\n_Room 2 upstairs (holds up to 25, no good for projecting; passage space to get to Room 3)_\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5fd544f8dc0b46441cdbe77c3e6165761b931973.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\">\n_Room 3 upstairs (holds up to 100, good for projecting; shoes off; seating on the floor or on chairs if they are placed on a carpet (available onsite)_", "created_at": "2017-09-28 17:15:59.155587", "updated_at": "2017-11-13 17:06:16.862809", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 773, "wiki": false, "reads": 20, "score": 104.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3613], "is_private": false}, {"id": 55176, "user_id": 2551, "topic_id": 10007, "post_number": 13, "raw": "Hey @nadia nice to see you too!\n\nYou were actually the main point in me finally digging up my password again.

We were already vegan when we started as a group in late-60s San Francisco but we had a very incomplete idea of a correct diet. \n\nIn the early 70s we started eating soybeans on a regular basis. Soon enough we were making soy milk and tofu on a large scale for our residents.  One of our more scientifically-minded members discovered fermented soy cakes from Indonesia: tempeh.  We figured out how to grow the spores (grown on sterilized sweet potatoes inoculated in test tubes) well enough that we created a tempeh starter kit that we sold commercially.  This was the first commercial offering of tempeh in North America.  You can read more of this history on this [this timeline](http://www.soyinfocenter.com/books/148).\n\nOne of any problems for a vegan is how to get vitamin B12.  Without it you get pernicious anemia.  We learned that the only way you can get it as a vegan is by eating certain kinds of yeast. But back in those early 70s days, the yeast they sold in health food stores tasted pretty bad.  So we hunted through all the kinds that got sold wholesale (there are a lot of them) and we found this one made by Red Star, and I forget their number code which was all they had for a name, that tasted great.  So good that we bought it in barrels, bagged it up and sold it.  This is what it looks like:\n![image|345x258](upload://6K6Ig3qUoNpFSvfWlDTVc02e1E6.jpeg) \n\nAnyway, we introduced these products to the health food world.  In 1975 I went with a crew to 2 major national health food conventions demonstrating tempeh and good tasting yeast to health food stores nationwide.  The following year \"Mother Earth News\" printed a big article about tempeh and then it became much more in demand.  That same yeast is now in most supermarkets.\n\nIt's great stuff, tastes very nice.

I think you are spot on. Like all tech, but in a more direct way, the suites of solutions that make up the smart city encode values and power relationships. Building the smart city is not conceptually far from building the [Next Generation Internet](https://ngi.eu): it demands technical choices that encode values. For now, in both cases, the values have been those of vendors and business. \n\nIf you de-emphasize them, you can go quite some way towards \"smart\". [I used to talk of \"Type 1-\" and \"Type 2 smart cities\"](http://www.cottica.net/2012/11/28/what-we-mean-by-smart-in-smart-cities/). Type 2 are non-vendor dominated, and so they can do some smart things that imply the destruction of GDP. They can do repair caf\u00e9s, and car bans, and community welfare, and mesh networks. They can be cheap and resilient and inclusive. \n\nBut even these things are not \"smart\" for everybody. They encode _my_ values, and those of my tribe. And these are great, but in any healthy city there _must_ be people who steer by other stars, who care about different things. Cities are ambiguous, because their social engine is diversity. Diversity fuels exchange, personal growth and prosperity, but also conflict and uneasiness. A stronger police present makes the parent of young children feel safer, but makes life miserable for African- and Arab-looking teenagers. A late night bar can be a place of joy for the younger citizens in the neighborhood, but a source of nuisance for the older folks that live upstairs from it. For this reason, I am unconvinced that you can find \"metrics\". Whose metrics are we talking about? \n\nIn his [2013 pamphlet](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnyegriffiths/2013/12/02/city-cynic-against-the-smart-city-by-adam-greenfield-review/#4784384f3b19), Adam Greenfield makes a convincing case that there can be no unambiguous, value-neutral metrics to maximize. Cities have to be regulated by endless dialogue and debate, right out in the agora. In other words, though the notion is unpopular, by politics. I am afraid he is right. If by some miracle you could steer a city by keeping metrics at nominal value, you would have reduced its complexity to the point where it is no longer a city, but something like a jail, or an amusement attraction like Disneyland.", "created_at": "2019-05-10 20:36:59.918493", "updated_at": "2019-05-12 09:51:40.685683", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 415, "wiki": false, "reads": 39, "score": 62.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 51057, "user_id": 3704, "topic_id": 9437, "post_number": 7, "raw": "did make time and really like the concept note.\nonly two points lacking from my perspective - differing levels of participation and funding.

Topic clutter can become a problem..\n\n\n### About the project\n\nThis conversation is part of a Horizon 2020 funded Coordination Action under the official name NGI Forward. The project focuses on building a coherent vision for the Next Generation Internet. The community research is hosted on Edgeryders, an online community of 5000 people in more than 80 countries who share experiences. By sharing experiences with one another we turn our collective knowledge into useful advice to make better decisions for ourselves and our families in the near future. As a consequence of getting to know people from around the world, we connect one another to important information, new ideas and new opportunities.\n\nThe research analysis considers content collected through http://edgeryders.eu, subject to online ethnographic analysis and semantic social network analysis.\n\nBeyond the research project, we are a community: We use the tools offered by this platform to help connect people with mutual interests, concerns and complimentary skills. The online conversation runs in parallel with events all over Europe to meet and share constructive approaches. Anyone is welcome to participate, either in English or in their native language.\n\nThe project is funded by the European Commission under grant agreement number 825652 from 2019-2021.\n\nThis conversation is hosted by [Edgeryders O\u00dc](https://edgeryders.eu/t/6640), in partnership with: [Aarhus University](https://international.au.dk/) (Denmark), [University of Warsaw](http://en.uw.edu.pl/) (Poland), [Resonance Design](https://www.theinternetofthings.eu/) (Netherlands), [Nesta](https://www.nesta.org.uk/) (United Kingdom), [Nesta Italia](https://www.nestaitalia.org/) (Italy) and the [City of Amsterdam](https://www.amsterdam.nl/) (Netherlands).\n\n![VerticallyIsolated|256x132](upload://jpafLC5fjXRGMUhboNPwwaR1yse.png)\n\nNGI Forward is a part of the [NGI Initiative](https://www.ngi.eu/)\n\n[/details]", "created_at": "2019-04-03 10:45:36.374825", "updated_at": "2020-02-04 20:55:27.469991", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 557, "wiki": false, "reads": 54, "score": 105.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 40330, "user_id": 4222, "topic_id": 7837, "post_number": 10, "raw": "Hi guys, I am very excited to be in this experience.

Pami\u0119tam jak PO dochodzi\u0142a do w\u0142adzy, to wszyscy mieli olbrzymie nadzieje, \u017ce inteligenci wreszcie zaczynaj\u0105 rz\u0105dzi\u0107. Wielu ludzi posz\u0142o za nimi, a oni ca\u0142kowicie zmarnowali pok\u0142adane w nich nadzieje. No i charyzmatyczny Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski wykorzysta\u0142 to perfekcyjnie. W dodatku przydarzy\u0142a si\u0119 katastrofa smole\u0144ska, kt\u00f3ra zjednoczy\u0142a ludzi i PiS si\u0119 nimi \"zaopiekowa\u0142\". To ju\u017c nawet nie chodzi o to, \u017ce PiS jest uto\u017csamiany z praw\u0105 stron\u0105. To tutaj bez znaczenia. Po prostu tego jeszcze nie by\u0142o, a wszyscy chcieli ju\u017c zmian. Tego ludziom w\u0142a\u015bnie brakowa\u0142o.\n\n\nWszyscy \u015bmiali si\u0119 z 500 +, \u017ce to nie wyjdzie. A wysz\u0142o. Ale 500+ to nie tylko realne pieni\u0105dze w portfelach, ale przede wszystkim symbol spe\u0142nionej obietnicy, w przeciwie\u0144stwie do PO, kt\u00f3re kojarzy\u0142o si\u0119 ju\u017c wtedy tylko z pisaniem bajek.  Kiedy\u015b w money.pl by\u0142 ranking spe\u0142nionych obietnic Tuska i tylko po\u0142owa z nich by\u0142a rzeczywi\u015bcie spe\u0142niona. PiS robi to co obieca\u0142. To jest dotrzymanie s\u0142owa. Tego w\u0142a\u015bnie ludzie oczekiwali od polityk\u00f3w, \u017ceby mo\u017cna im by\u0142o w ko\u0144cu zaufa\u0107. \u017beby przestali w ko\u0144cu k\u0142ama\u0107. Czy kto\u015b zarzuci teraz PiSowi, \u017ce sk\u0142ama\u0142? Sk\u0142amali, \u017c\u0119 s\u0105 patriotami? PiS jest raczej tylko z deklaracji prawicowy, ale w dzia\u0142aniach ju\u017c nie koniecznie. I wcale nie zdziwi\u0142bym si\u0119 za jaki\u015b czas, \u017ce PiS zalegalizuje np. zwi\u0105zki homoseksualne czy marihuane. Wtedy byliby ju\u017c nie do pokonania. Zatem PiS jest skuteczny. Przy czym nie wierz\u0119 w to, \u017ce PiS chce zbawi\u0107 \u015bwiat. To jest ch\u0142odna polityczna kalkulacja i nie mo\u017cna o tym nigdy zapomina\u0107.\n\nNa PiS g\u0142osuje w du\u017cej mierze wsch\u00f3d kraju, czyli upraszczaj\u0105c tendencje wywodz\u0105ce si\u0119 z historii - by\u0142y rosyjski zab\u00f3r. Zachodnia cz\u0119\u015b\u0107 Polski to byli - m\u00f3wi\u0105c kolokwialnie - \"Niemcy\" i zupe\u0142nie inna kultura, mentalno\u015b\u0107 i stopie\u0144 rozwoju. W zaborze rosyjskim natomiast ludzie byli gn\u0119bieni, raczej im zabierano i nie dbano o rozw\u00f3j kraju. Jedynym ratunkiem dla tych ludzi by\u0142 ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142, dlatego ludzie do niego lgn\u0119li. Ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 pomaga\u0142 ubogim, cierpi\u0105cym, chorym. Dlatego, tak my\u015bl\u0119, \u017ce dzi\u015b tam odej\u015bcie od tradycji, czy religii jest du\u017co bardziej pi\u0119tnowane ni\u017c na zachodzie Polski. Mam znajom\u0105 z Rzeszowa, kt\u00f3rej rodzice mocno krytykowali, \u017ce chcia\u0142a zamieszka\u0107 ze swoim ch\u0142opakiem przed \u015blubem. To by\u0142o dla nich w zasadzie nie do pomy\u015blenia. Zagrozili, \u017ce j\u0105 wydziedzicz\u0105. To wielka si\u0142a spo\u0142eczno\u015bci, kt\u00f3ra broni tradycyjnych warto\u015bci. No i PiS odpowiedzia\u0142 najlepiej na potrzeby tych os\u00f3b. \n\nReasumuj\u0105c, musz\u0119 przyzna\u0107, \u017ce bardzo dobrze \u017cyje mi sie w Polsce. Nie jestem za PiS, aczkolwiek lepiej \u017cyje mi si\u0119 w Polsce rz\u0105dzonej przez PiS. Do tej pory mia\u0142em poczucie, \u017ce mnie wszyscy oszukuj\u0105. Kilka lat sp\u0119dzi\u0142em za granic\u0105. Kiedy\u015b nie widzia\u0142em dla siebie innej opcji ni\u017c ten wyjazd za granic\u0119, a teraz czuj\u0119, \u017ce nie mam potrzeby ju\u017c st\u0105d wyje\u017cd\u017ca\u0107. Co\u015b si\u0119 zmieni\u0142o. Nie potrafi\u0119 tego zdefiniowa\u0107, ale mo\u017ce spr\u00f3buj\u0119. Zwi\u0119kszy\u0142 si\u0119 poziom bezpiecze\u0144stwa w tym kraju. Bezpiecze\u0144stwa finansowego, socjalnego. Wiadomo generalnie dok\u0105d zmierzamy. Za rz\u0105d\u00f3w PO nie raz policyjne pa\u0142ki sz\u0142y w ruch na r\u00f3\u017cnych manifestacjach. Za PiS chyba tylko raz to mia\u0142o miejsce we Wroc\u0142awiu po \u015bmierci Igora Stachowiaka.Teraz ka\u017cdy mo\u017ce wyrazi\u0107 swoje niezadowolenie, zorganizowa\u0107 manifestacj\u0119, w tym sensie, \u017ce wiele g\u0142os\u00f3w jest spo\u0142ecznie reprezentowanych, a nie jak za PO kiedy dominowa\u0142a jedna wizja \u015bwiata. Ja nie widz\u0119, \u017ceby w Polsce demokracja by\u0142a w jakikolwiek spos\u00f3b zagro\u017cona. \n\nWyobra\u017cacie sobie 15 lat temu, \u017ce ludzie pod Sejmem krzycz\u0105 has\u0142a antyrz\u0105dowe? Rozgoniliby ich od razu. Pad\u0142yby pewnie od razu argument: nie znasz si\u0119, jeste\u015b nieukiem. Mo\u017cliwe, \u017ce w Polsce jest \u0142amana praworz\u0105dno\u015b\u0107, nie mnie jednak to ocenia\u0107.

Nie mniej uwa\u017cam \u017ce reforma s\u0105downictwa jest absolutnie nieudana, podobnie jak reforma szkolnictwa, ale jestem przekonany, \u017ce to co dzia\u0142o si\u0119 dotychczas w s\u0105downictwie, to by\u0142 mrok. Totalna samowolka i potrzeba by\u0142o zmian.

This book seems, from the reference to the William Rees article \"Is Humanity Fatally Successful?\", to fall squarely within the field of Neo-Malthusian writers, represented most famously by 1968's \"The Population Bomb\" by Paul Ehrlich and 1972's \"The Limits to Growth\" by The Club of Rome. Those books were seen as landmarks by sustainability advocates, and by economists mostly as bad jokes. There is a famous bet by business professor Julian Simon and Paul Ehrlich about whether increasing resource use would lead to an increase in commodities prices by the year 2000 -- of course Ehrlich lost badly. I am quite favorable toward an improvement in human interaction with the environment, but I cannot in good conscience ignore such practical considerations -- many advocates find this attitude off-putting.\n\nSo st this point I tend to ask what the author/activist's position is toward economists' critiques of the approach of many ecologists -- that they are romantics first, and that the predictions of the demise of civilization that they often make are, as Mark Twain quipped about reports of his death, \"greatly exaggerated\". Malthus has been... I would not say \"wrong\", but rather \"not so far right\" for 222 years -- which is pretty dismal.\n\nCertainly there is no question in my mind that society evolves, and that technology evolves to solve various problems, including those of the cost of resources (and so far more relevantly, the cost of pollution). Humanity reaches for improvements in human lives; mostly in physical conditions so far, but also increasingly, as the world becomes wealthier and more technologically adept, some, not many so far, search for a better relationship with the creatures that also inhabit our beleaguered planet.\n\nAs I have mentioned, I think, on the chicken-and-egg scale, that human society and attitudes would need to change first, and technology afterwards -- otherwise, how could we be willing to make the steps needed to live differently? So far, the people that we have are not so eager, outside a few pockets in Europe and West-Coast America and a few other places, to live in a more accommodating way with this world. But perhaps those pockets will expand. One can hope. Perhaps this book will point to some ideas about solutions.My general feeling is that talk may or may not lead somewhere, but no talk will lead nowhere.\n\nI love Simonova's sand animations.", "created_at": "2020-05-01 08:38:58.989669", "updated_at": "2020-05-01 08:39:50.229418", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 429, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 21.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24581, "user_id": 2095, "topic_id": 641, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Experimenting Alternative Economics in Cairo, Egypt</b>\n\nI am researching the alternative economics initiatives to hold an event to experiments the different concepts here in Cairo.

Introduction</h2>\n\nThis topic shows how to add an embedded video to a Discourse topic in such a way that a link preview picture appears when sharing the topic on Facebook or other platforms that support the [Open Graph protocol](http://ogp.me/).\n\nFacebook etc. does not generate a screenshot of an embedded video to show as the link preview, so our workaround is to do this manually and embed the screenshot as well \u2013 but in such a way that only websites see it, not people.\n\n**Note:** This howto uses the new, Markdown based markup for images in Discourse. You can easily adapt it to the `<img src=\"\u2026\">` HTML markup that DIscourse used earlier.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2. Instructions</h2>\n\n1. **Create the topic with your video.** As usual, to embed your video simply post a link to your video on its own line, with no whitespace in front of the link, and with an empty line above it. This works for YouTube, Vimeo and a few other video sharing platforms. If it does not work for a platform you use regularly, a Discourse software admin can fix that for you.\n\n2. **Try if Facebook will pick up a thumbnail picture.** Because for _some_ videos at least from YouTube, Facebook will pick up the video thumbnail automatically and use it as a link preview picture. This could depend on video popularity: if you embedded a popular video, Facebook will have a thumbnail picture in its database already and use that. If the video is not popular and it does not have a video thumbnail already, Facebook will however not generate one.\n\n3. **Create a screenshot of your video.** Simply stop the video, create a screenshot, crop to the video boundaries, and save as a JPG image.\n\n4. **Add the screenshot to your topic.** Upload it like you upload any picture. It will result in code like the following:\n\n        ![VideoThumbnailExample|690x326](upload://6KZkUo9JM73CvgBz3vyHQN2Wrvi.jpeg)\n\n5. **Hide the screenshot from humans.** For that, hide the image's markup inside `[details=(video preview thumbnail)] \u2026 [/details]`. It will for example look like this:\n\n    ```text\n    [details=(video preview thumbnail)]\n        ![VideoThumbnailExample|690x326](upload://6KZkUo9JM73CvgBz3vyHQN2Wrvi.jpeg)\n    [/details]\n    ```\n\n6. **Share the link to the topic on Facebook** or another website that supports Open Graph for link previews. If no preview appears the first time on Facebook, try again a few minutes later because Facebook needs time to create and sort in a link preview image ([details](/t/id/6463#heading--4-2)).\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--3\">3.

According to an outmoded conception of self manifesting in a built environment that perpetuates an individual, and individuating mode of behaviour and business, fiduciary duty and profit-based economics 101 makes for a situation in which companies seeded by EU fuding in the past now have massive GDP (some 4 times that of the Union) and are 'stakeholders' in Europe. The vested interest is in maintaining the status quo that feeds the bottom line of these companies, and this is a serious retardation to the growth of the European project. 'The tail has come to wag the dog' you might say.\n\nIn any case we are not here to talk about the problem, we are here to design the solution. How can we change things around? Well for a start we need to begin following and supporting the work of people like Kevin Doyle Jones who are helping to build the Social Capital Markets. I am off to Malmo, Sweden in early May to attend\u00a0 SoCap Europe, the annual european social capital market conference. Impact investment is clearly a great way for us to go. In short, it goes like this: when a company incorporates the intention is to protect private and personal assets, noone wants to lose their family home and savings if the company goes bust or gets sued and so they incorporate, but this raises a problem. By incorporating people become legally bound to fiduciary duty, this means they must do what is best for the interests of the company/shareholders. Now according to a profit-based economics 101 model this equates to: <em>the most profit in the shortest term</em>. This latter often involves making decisions with no moral/ethical basis, but these decisions must be made due to the shortsighted nature of fiduciary duty. What people like Kevin do is to create favourable markets and pr based on impact accounting to attract philanthropically minded investors to doing good by their investment via the social capital markets.\n\nHow does impact investment do this? Well its rather simple in theory: impact accounting measures the monetary value of the impact created by a certain business. Take a massively oversimplified example: a business teaching children English in a developing country:\u00a0 this can improve the participants chances of finding a job, providing financial security and thus lowering child numbers per family. This, in turn, provides a saving to the state of x amount of money.\n\nAccording to profit 101 when an investor looks at a potential company they look at the bottom line, 'how much is the return on the investment?', and work from there. With impact investment , alongside the profit, you can see the value of the impact created by the business thus making the investment more inviting than what would otherwise be a less attractive profit margin by comparison with other, more ruthless companies. It creates a niche for companies interested in creating a better world for everyone within a market which has thus far been focussed on competition and the enrichment of the individual self.\n\nI think the neo-liberal model places to much on the shouders of the individual. The individual is expected to be all things to all people with the full archetypal constellation of being resting on the neo-liberal man's shoulders. Hence he strives for himself on the basis of competition in an effort to dominate the lesser aspects of himself, there is nothing beyond him...but of course this is utterly flawed, not to mention one-sided and faithless. We look at 'equality' of the sexes, 'equality' of cultures...we have a lot of work to do. The psychology we have built into our environment via our institutions governs our social and political development. We have worked and are working still to change that psychology to a better way, and we must now build a new paradigm into our material workings, albeit with a sense of caution having understood the consequences of this kind of practice. For example, our education system is deeply flawed, its genesis having been based in the christian-industrial era. In Ireland we still have girl's schools and boy's schools, with different class-rooms for different ages as if intellect worked according to age. Without going to far into it, it will suffice to mention that the way in which we begin things and establish them has a far-flung effect on how they develop in the future. Now is a pivotal time.\n\nAlso there is Yunus' model of social business. Social business is an amazingly simple and effective conception. It goes beyond social enterprise as it has no profit-orientation. A social business according to its original conception by Mohhamed Yunus, is set up to deal directly with a social problem. The workers own the company and are paid just as in a similar profit oriented company, position to position from machine operator to CEO are paid exaclty as in a normal business, the only difference is that there is no owner at the top that takes all of the profit. Instead the profit is put into company scaling so that the problem can be addressed more widely, and thereafter, once the problem is resolved, profits can go toward improvements in the quality of life of those who work for the company. Grameen Bank, and partnerships between Grammen and Danone, Viola and other companies serve as useful illusttrations as to how the concept works.\u00a0\n\nSocial enterprise is a hybrid of both pure social business and the capitalist model. Social capital markets usually work with this hybrid form.\n\nThere are also worker cooperatives like Mondragon, David de Ugart\u00e9s Phyles and many other transnational micro-economic networks that are the current seeds for developments that will hatch from the digitization of currency. We already see the beginning of crowdfunding here in Ireland. What happens when you make the public investors? Self-organization, pure and simple. The people will agree as to what they need and they will develop and fund and realize their own solutions. When currency becomes easily transferrable in digital format globally, exchange will explode, people will be able to self-organize according to communities of shared practice and shared value.\n\nIt is our position to encourage these things and to guide their development. Our generation understand the development because we live with it, many from older generations do not. Theirs is the older centralised self, and this is in part why we have problems in changing. In Ireland at least, if you go to see the board of most institutions you will not find people under 50. There is a lack of a sense of entitlement in the Irish population that is left of the legacy of the roman catholic church. Authority was the excercise of power over others, dominance, and it was excercised by oppression. We are now seeing the longterm effects in this country where the old rule the young by virtue of percieved 'positions of authority' learned under the thumb. This has to finish.\n\nIf we examine globally the types of enterprise that are successful even through the downturn we will see the characteristics of the new global culture emerging. By supporting this we will survive, opposing it I reckon we will become fragmented and chaotic. Right, its early in the day yet and lots to do. Thanks for your response. What do you think we can do?\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-03 12:22:30", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:38.960614", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1310, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62446, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 11285, "post_number": 3, "raw": "sorry, was meant to change the time!", "created_at": "2019-10-29 10:02:24.374027", "updated_at": "2019-10-29 10:02:24.374027", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 7, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 27.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [62445], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 53423, "user_id": 4779, "topic_id": 9893, "post_number": 1, "raw": "![Photo%20by%20Erkan%20Utu%20from%20Pexels|690x387](upload://qV5Tc7aqAA0bc0D28udVjwKPLl2.jpeg) \n\nP\u0159ed p\u00e1r dny jsem se bavil s kamar\u00e1dkou, kter\u00e1 u\u017e del\u0161\u00ed dobu \u0159e\u0161\u00ed sv\u00e9 zdravotn\u00ed probl\u00e9my.

Some join in, actively listening, asking questions or giving thoughtful responses. (This is a safe place and not for debating opinions or speaking for others.)\n\nThe discussion begins with first hand accounts of attempts taken to solve societal issues and moves to navigating the personal challenges experienced by members. Nuances and the various different contexts surrounding these challenges begins to show.\n\n**Information analysis**\n\nNext open source technology is used to make connections between topics being discussed, the people discussing them, places, projects, solutions and struggles. When we put this together, patterns start to emerge that help join these ideas and people to each other and to other information, skill and resources.\n\nBy the end of the process, our community members have gained a richer knowledge and understanding of the issue they wish to tackle and have a blueprint to put their idea into action.\n\n## What comes out of it\n<br>\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Inputs</th>\n    <th>Platform</th>\n    <th>Outputs</th>\n        <th>Outcome</th>\n\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Good People</td>\n    <td>Conversation</td>\n    <td>Articles</td>\n    <td>  Clusters of local actors that together try out new ideas to secure resilient livelihoods for their communities and themselves.

Do you use special tools to organise Edgeryders events? \nYes we do.\nWe could not find what we needed, so we had to build our own technology. Other organisations now use them to run productive and enjoyable online events that yield high return on the investment of time and resources of everyone involved. \n\n#### A toolkit to transform events into collective intelligence engines\n\n* Online platform\n* Custom modules for rapid website generation\n* Custom modules for registration forms\n* Custom Modules for data analysis\n* Custom Modules for visualisation\n* Custom software for coordination\n* Custom software for coordination\n\n---\n\n## 3. Can you tell us more about the technical details of Edgeryders tools and methods for events?\n\n#### A toolkit to transform events into collective intelligence engines\n* Online platform\n* Custom modules for rapid website generation\n* Custom modules for registration forms\n* Custom Modules for data analysis\n* Custom Modules for visualisation\n* Custom software for coordination\n* Custom software for coordination\n\n**Our toolkit is a stack of technologies that enable you to:**\n\n* Produce dynamically updated minisites around topics on the fly:\n  1. The minisite content (but not the structure) must be editable from inside Discourse  ***or***  both content and structure must be editable an deployable from the webkit GUI, using a Discourse account. The second option would however mean that a full markdown editor with live preview etc. would have to be added to the webkit, which is why I am rather against that. Let\u2019s keep it simple, and close to Discourse, so that it can be published as a \u201csite builder for Discourse\u201d eventually.\n  2. There should be a few modules that take in YAML content (as a link to a Discourse post that contains a YAML code section) and display it in a visually enhanced way. This is needed to publish sections of the minisite in a way beyond what Markdown inside a Discourse editor is capable of. An example for that technique is [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/11088/2).\n* Improve success of onboarding people towards the edgeryders site\n* Standardise our distributed event production methodology\n* Build an effective alternative to social media communication campaigns for outreach efforts\n* Decentralise key community onboarding and activation tasks away from community managers to volunteers (welcome committee).\nImprove visibility and communication of research findings\n\n\n### Online Platform\n **A dynamic online space for  learning, networking, coordination and business development** \n\nSome of our clients and parts prefer to nest their online collaboration spaces within the platforms maintained by the Edgeryders organisation. Either because they don't have in house tech support, or because they want to draw the benefits of being plugged into our friendly and supportive global community. We don't charge anything for this, but do require everyone to agree to basic rules of conduct and respect the social contract which keeps our space healthy and generative for everyone concerned. \nFeatures of our online collaboration platform solution:\n\n  * Email slayer: Used correctly this platform will kill need for email based communication. Edgeryders is an email-free organisation thanks to this technology and  easy to follow protocols for using it.\n \n  * No more document version headaches: Any static document can be transformed into a dynamic, collaboratively editable one. \n\n  * HR can use this to lower cost and time spent on recruiting and training new members.\n  * Project teams can quickly generate interactive reports with links to key documents on the fly\n  * Project teams or event organisers can generate interactive and dynamic websites for the events where curated content from conversations before and after are displayed.\n  * For Communication campaigns, it becomes a way to crowd-source reporting and outreach efforts among its members.\n* Open Ethnographer add-on: Allows you to annotate content on your platform and create ethnographies of your conversation. Good for: low cost high quality and always up to date knowledgement management.\n* Graphryder add-on: Allows you to see SSN graphs of your conversation and an ethnography of your distributed business cluster. Good for:  Finding the right people for any given challenge or task.\n* Training add-on: We offer community management training, as well as training for management of the forum and best practices to help them be successful.\n* Consulting add-on: We can take on community management, content curation, event coordination and even co-apply with our clients for research projects, grants or open calls.\n\n\n1.

Add-on features for Graphryder & SenseStack\n\n\n#### Registration forms that smoothly convert your audience into active contributors of high quality content\n\nWe want to make it easy for people to connect and start the conversations before, and after the event. So that your events generate consistently generate high roi for participants and for your organisation.\n\n1. Example: AI & Justice Summit - Booklet\n2. Demo: Invitation - Registration - articles on platform - summary post & discussion - booklet.\n\n#### Always-on video chat webinar and break out meeting rooms\n\nThese are intended for things like running online events where you need breakout rooms, running team meetings or setting up a digital watercooler spaces for spontaneous chats. They are only available to people with user accounts on your online platform.\n\n1. Features: We need to ask Maria and Owen about this!\n2. Demo: create an edgeryders account (fill in registration form) then [click here](https://now.edgeryders.eu/room/community?fbclid=IwAR1GMjc6SCd9ASrD4E8nDfA1afWvzvMCkHWZ__prp6RgS-f6psfRhF2s6U0).\n\n### Add-on layers for Communication & Marketing\n\n#### A message app-based alternative to the email newsletter\n\nwe have a chatbot on telegram and on whatsapp to which people send messages in response to a call for input on social media. That chatbot relays and aggregates the contents onto a platform where an editor can then put together a summary of what has been said and send it back to the people who participated.  **Use case is that frontline medical workers and activists are largely sharing information and coordinating via messaging apps**  . The problem with this is that: 1) it is not clear that the information shared is accurate 2) people are just overwhelmed with the sheer volume of info 3) there is no documentation of what has been exchanged \u2014 so no way of passing on learning in case of a new crisis 4) you do not keep track of who has contributed what - which means that you do not know who the real experts are that you could then turn to in the future for help.  **We have already developed some of the code to enable this: Now we need a rough sketch of a nice, simple user experience and interface/information architecture that works for people who are really short on time and super stressed. Can you give us 30 minutes of your time today? We are working here:**   **[#t_edgeryders_an1s2t4bxd](https://euvsvirus.slack.com/archives/C0123B1JS2Z)**\n\n#### Campaign builder\n\n**We have developed a stack of modules that enable you to quickly set up a single purpose minisite and it with relevant content**  .This makes it easy and inexpensive to so things like set up a website around a specific activity such as conference or crowdfunding campaign. As well as present content picked from the online forum that enables your to feature discussion threads or high quality posts with little additional work. Everything is easily updated through the platform. Examples include: [http://er-campaigns.surge.sh](http://er-campaigns.surge.sh/), [work.edgeryders.eu](http://work.edgeryders.eu/), https://youthful-brown-c96bcf.netlify.com/ and [crowdfund.edgeryders.eu](http://crowdfund.edgeryders.eu/)\n\n#### Rapid Landing Page generator\n\nWe have developed a stack of modules that enable you to quickly set up a single purpose with relevant content .This makes it easy and inexpensive to so things like set up a website around a specific activity such as conference or crowdfunding campaign.

For example you may want to limit access to people who participated in the preparatory conversations or participated in a previous activity. It is also useful if you want to do crowdfunding campaigns where one of the perks is to have one\u2019s questions featured during the webinar. Example here: https://live.edgeryders.eu/\n\n----\n## 4.

We feared for loved ones, and for the long-term freedom and prosperity of our societies. We felt powerless, and anxious in the face of uncertainty. We still do.\n\nBut, at some point along the way, we realized there was something we could do. We have in our midst a team of data scientists. When the pandemic hit, Kristof and Michal were analysing trends in the evolution of Internet technology. Theirs is a big data method: they do text analysis on large repositories of academic papers, news articles, social media. We realized we could use the same method to investigate the virus and its companion illness. It would be like redirecting our searchlight onto a new target.\n\n**So we did that. In the space of only a few weeks, Kristof and Michal came back with results, neatly arranged in [an interactive website ](https://covid.delabapps.eu/). And that\u2019s where we need your help.**\n\n*Here\u2019s the thing: this type of analysis scales well, but its results are not easy to interpret. We can see, for example, that technologies associated with the pandemic fall into four groups: remote work, medical, social distancing, contact tracing. This makes sense at first sight, but what does it mean? That people are using these technologies a lot? That researchers are working to improve these technologies over others? Or is the result an artifact of the way we look at the data? Is there a way that we can determine if there are obvious gaps in our technological arsenal? If we found any, we could look into investing to plug them.*\n\nThis type of analysis becomes much more actionable when you provide context to it. As I pored over early results, I could not help notice a positive sentiment for [PEPP-PT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-European_Privacy-Preserving_Proximity_Tracing). Except that, in the very same days, the PEPP-PT consortium had collapsed due to the withdrawal of several research institutes over privacy concerns. Before the collapse, I might have interpreted the positive sentiment as validation. \u201cLook, the tech community likes this protocol!\u201d. In the light of the collapse, it made more sense to read it as na\u00efve enthusiasm, or even spin. A possible interpretation could be: \u201cit is a good idea to let the community poke holes in any specific solution before we endorse it\u201d. Another one is: \u201cscientists and engineers are still humans. In a crisis, they reach for a solution, and want it to work. Their critical abilities are, for a time, weakened.\u201d\n\n**In sum, we have a large trove of data on COVID-19, which seems to hold important knowledge, if we could just unlock it. So, we propose an experiment. Let\u2019s get together (online), and question the data.** \nLet\u2019s look at them, turn them around in our heads, interrogate each other on their possible meaning. Let\u2019s formulate hypoteses, and see if we can think of ways to test them. Kristof and Michal can transform them into queries and visualization in real time, or close enough. In other words, let\u2019s augment big data analysis with collective intelligence methods. It will be a way for us to learn more about both COVID-19 and this particular big data methodology.\n\n\n\n# When:\n## 3rd of June, 5PM CEST.\n\n# How to see what came of it:\n[**Follow this link to come to the transcription of the session:**](https://edgeryders.eu/t/transcript-webinar-making-sense-of-a-covid-19-world/14385/2)\n\n#\n\n**We will record this webinar for research purposes.

Neoclassical economics has been so successful that it has become difficult to see the world in any other way. For this reason, I have long been drawn to scholarly work that takes on economic problems from a different intellectual background. In the past ten years it has been mostly biology for me; but, starting about five years ago, I have been drawn more and more to anthropology. \n\nEconomic anthropology is fascinating to an economist. Anthropologists use familiar terms (production, exchange, trade), but their approach to these phenomena could not be more different from that of economists. The latter look for abstraction: first, make a minimal set of assumptions on human nature, just enough to enable the emergence of a coherent mathematical model of these collective phenomena. Next, discard the phenomena altogether and study, instead, the model. \n\nAntropologists are different. They are constantly drawing in aspects of these phenomena that resist to abstraction, and that most economists would consider unimportant. For example, upon learning that an indigenous population exchanges certain objects considered valuable \u2013 for example weapons, or cloaks \u2013 they ask questions like: do these objects have names, or are they equivalent to each other? Do they carry religious or mythical connotations? Are they supposed to be metaphors for something else, for example a spear might be alluding to the bones of a god, or a mythical ancestor?\n\nIn sum, anthropologists tend to be context people. As they study a phenomenon, they are intensely aware of what actually goes on in the background. For this reason, they have often been invoked to help out economic analysis where \"the model\" could not be depended upon to work reliably, and where concrete results mattered. Historically this has meant two areas: development economics and economic policy making. In development economics, the first name that comes to mind is that [Albert O. Hirschman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_O._Hirschman), one of the heroes of my student days. He was an economist, not an anthropologist, but his attention to \"what lies outside the model\" is reminiscent of the anrthopologist's gaze. \n\nIn policy making, I have placed [James Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_C._Scott) into my personal pantheon for his magnificent [*Seeing like a state*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeing_Like_a_State). This piece of work has influenced profoundly the way I look at economic policy, and inspired possibly my grimmest lecture, [The Black Briefing](http://www.cottica.net/download/the-black-briefing/). In more recent times I have followed the star of the recently deceased [David Graeber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Graeber). Graeber specialized in theories of value: his [*Debt: the first 5,000 years*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5000_Years) provides a much-needed long-term history of money. *Debt* is exactly the kind of book contemporary economists are incapable of writing, because it requires viewing their paradigm as the product of its own time and ideology, instead of considering it as a natural law. \n\nAt the moment I am reading a precursor book to *Debt*, called *Toward An Anthropological Theory of Value: The False Coin of Our Own Dreams*. In typical Graeber style, it meanders across the subject, taking frequent detours to explore interesting thoughts and nuggets of the evidence to the side of the main argument. One of these asides is dedicated to French social scientist [Marcel Mauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Mauss). I knew next to nothing about Mauss, but he turns out to be a natural candidate as forerunner of the Sci-Fi Economics Lab. In what follows, quotes are from *An Anthropological Theory of Value*.\n\nHe was social science royalty: his mentor and uncle was Emile Durkheim. Naturally, he was part of an intellectual climate where French scholars, including Durkheim himself, worked on a systematic critique of a British school of thought descended from Thomas Hobbes. Hobbes exerted a powerful influence of the thinking of those times (and of our own) with the notion that \n\n> given human beings\u2019 endlessly acquisitive propensities, a state of nature could only have been a \u201cwar of all against all\u201d; society proper could only begin when everyone agreed to create some overarching political power.\n\nIn this intellectual climate, it made sense to study contracts. Hobbes himself called \"social contract\" the act whereby people sacrifice their \"natural\" agency to exert violence on one another, and confer it to a collective entity: the state, the Leviathan. Mauss addresses the issue in his most famous piece of work, called *Essai sur le don*. In it, he came up with the signature move of economic anthropology, the same one that Graeber himself uses in *Debt*: look at historical records and observe that they contradict the story told by theorists. \n\n>  He also notes that, contrary to the speculations of the likes of Hobbes, or Adam Smith, or modern economists, the first voluntary, contractual relations were not between individuals but between social groups: \u201cclans, tribes, and families\u201d (3). Neither were they essentially political, or for that matter economic, in nature; rather, they were, as he puts it, \u201ctotal,\u201d bringing together domains we would differentiate as \u201creligious, legal, moral and economic.\u201d\n\nAnthropology comes into it because, at this time, anthropologists can still observe \"live\" non-capitalist societies. If pursuing self-interest (Hobbes) through \"truck and barter\" (Smith) is a natural attribute of humans, we should observe it in action in any human society. And, Mauss points out, they don't. Furthermore, the concepts themselves used by these theorists are far from universal, and do not necessarily make sense outside of the culture that has generated them. \n\n> Mauss did wish to argue that it is only with the market that it is even possible to imagine a pure self-interest\u2014a concept that, he remarked, could not even be translated into Greek, or Latin, or Sanskrit, or classical Arabic\u2014and that the modern ideal of the pure selfless gift is simply an impossible mirror image of this notion.\n\nBut Mauss is a great ancestor for the Sci-Fi Economics Lab also in another sense: he seems to have consciously worked to construct the theoretical foundation of radically different, utopian economic systems. His biography confirms that he was a committed (though, in his own words, \"irreligious\") socialists, very active in the French cooperative movement. In the early 1920s, as he was writing *Le don*, he had become very interested in the reality of post-revolutionary Russia, and specifically in Lenin's New Economic Policy. It carried a very important lesson: \n\n> With the first great attempt to create a modern alternative to capitalism foundering, Mauss apparently decided it was time to bring the results of comparative ethnography\u2014crude and undeveloped though he well knew them to be\u2014to bear, in order to sketch out at least the outlines of what a more viable alternative might be like. He was particularly concerned with the historical significance of the market. One thing the Russian experiment had proved was that it was not going to be possible to simply abolish buying and selling by writ. Lenin had tried. And even though Russia was the least monetarized society in Europe, he had failed. For the foreseeable future, Mauss concluded, we were stuck with a market of some sort or another. \n\nAnd here comes the money quote (emphasis mine):\n\n> Still, there had to be a difference between \u201cthe market\u201d as a mere technique for the allocation of certain types of economic good (for instance, between democratically organized cooperatives or professional organizations), and \u201cthe market\u201d as it had come to exist in the industrial West, as the basic organizing principle of social life, the ultimate determinant of value. What Mauss set out to do, then, was to **try to get at the heart of precisely what it was about the logic of the market that did such violence to ordinary people\u2019s sense of justice and humanity**. To understand the popular appeal of socialist parties and social welfare programs, and **by examining the ethnographic record, imagine what a society in accord with such popular standards of justice might look like**: one in which the market could be relegated to its proper function, as a technique for decentralized decision-making, a kind of popular polling device on the relative appeal of different sorts of consumer goods, and in which an entirely different set of institutions preside over areas of really significant social value.\n\nGraeber then goes on to explain how Mauss is a sort of complement to Marx. The former focuses on critiquing capitalism, the latter seems more interested in what alternatives to capitalism would look like. To do it, he asks hard questions, that \u2013 if followed to their ultimate consequences \u2013 put the very foundations of modern economics in doubt. I could not imagine a better legacy for the Sci-Fi Economics Lab. \n\n*Photo credit: By Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Amis du Centre d&#039;\u00c9tudes Sociologiques (SACES) - https://medihal.archives-ouvertes.fr/medihal-00541249, CC0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=83275119*", "created_at": "2020-09-30 14:58:51.256272", "updated_at": "2020-09-30 14:58:51.256272", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1524, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 413.4, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3816, 5, 6736], "is_private": false}, {"id": 40412, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 7853, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Please guys keep the word \"pirate\" or \"pirate radio\" out of this whenever talking about anything edgeryders/openvillage related in public fora (including this platform).

We grew out of an online community, which now has 4,000 members. We make our money by consulting, mostly (for now) in the area of social and economic development. Our consulting is based on what we call collective intelligence; in our case, this means a mixture of open conversations (mostly online), that are then studied by ethnographers. These conversations can get very large, but we have ways (and software) to aggregate them. Research is Edgeryders\u2019 R&D lab, the place where we experiment with new methods and build new tools. More: https://edgeryders.eu/t/our-company/6640\n\n\n### Responsibilities\n\nWe are now looking to build a network of researchers, domain experts and project managers to scale our ability to take part in research projects. The research coordinator is the hub  of the research network. (S)he:\n\n* Maps the strengths and skills of the company and its community. \n* Maps out opportunities to take part in exciting research projects. \n* Makes contact as needed with potential partners, researchers, allies and funders. \n* Represents Edgeryders at research-related events.\n* Coordinates the completion of research funding applications. \n* Reports to the research director (currently @alberto).\n\n\n### Duration, compensation, career perspectives\n\n* 8 months contract, starting immediately, looking to be transformed into permanent depending on performance and board approval.\n* One to two days per week, depending on seniority\n* 1,000 EUR per month.\n* Possibility to take on additional responsibilities and additional compensation on successful research proposals.\n* Edgeryders has no-hierarchies, only teams. You start as team leader, so you are already at the top in operations. We will consider a successful candidate for senior management (a seat on the board of directors), at the end of the 8 months period. \n\n\n### We offer\n\n* Freedom and autonomy. We estimate you will take one to two days a week to carry out your tasks, but no one will check how much time you spend at your desk. You are also welcome to use the office for your own work. \n* An exciting and friendly environment, and a shared sense of purpose and building our own future.\n* Flexibility. If we think we are a good match for each other, everything is negotiable. For example, if you are more junior and want to do an internship instead, we can discuss this. \n* Cheap, high quality accommodation in Brussels possible. \n\n\n### We require\n\n* The highest moral standards. Ethics in research is all-important, always. Also, we are a community as much as we are a company. We stand for each other, and are committed to operating with honour at all times. \n* Interest in research. Any discipline OK.\n* Ability to work in teams, and to lead one, giving it a sense of direction, maintaining a calendar to work with etc.\n* Comfortable working online. That\u2019s what we do!\n* Fluency in English. Any other language a plus.\n* Excellent English reading/writing skills.\n* Good people skills.\n* Based in Brussels.\n* We are happy to consider candidates from all and any age, gender, nationality, culture, experience, qualifications or lack thereof. \n\n\n## Application process\n\nThe application process is based on practical skills.\n\n\n### Deadline\n\nThere is no deadline. You can send in your application immediately. The process stops when we find the right person. \n\n\n### Step 1: apply\n\nWrite an email to alberto [at] edgeryders [dot] eu, stating why you think you are a good match for the role. Add a CV. \n\n\n### Step 2: Q&A\n\nWe make an appointment by phone or VOIP or in person. We use this to get to know each other better, and to give you a chance to ask questions about the position.\n\n\n### Step 3: assignment\n\nThe final stage of our recruitment process is a sort of test. We are testing your ability to map the company\u2019s strength to opportunities for funded research, that is the key skill for a research coordinator. You will be asked to produce a concept note for a possible research project that Edgeryders might attempt. This means understanding what we are good at, and looking for opportunities where we, in your opinion can do a good job. \n\nDon\u2019t worry: we do not expect you to come with a workable proposition right away, we just want to see how your mind works. Spend a few hours on this, not a few weeks. If you do produce a workable idea, and we decide to use it, and we do get the contract, we promise on our honour to compensate you even if you don\u2019t want to take the job.\n\nA concept note is a document no longer than three pages, stating:\n\n1. The object of the research.\n1. Why Edgeryders is ideally suited for the project\n1. Who would fund the research. Please identify the specific opportunity: not \u201cthis would be funded by the European Union\u201d, but \u201capply to the [Collective Awareness Platforms call](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020-section/collective-awareness-platforms-sustainability-and-social-innovation-caps) under Horizon 2020\u201d.

Since the very early days, we did things like investigate novel features of contemporary societies, develop software to represent our online community as a social network in real time, attended conferences and produced papers. We do this in part because we are passionate about learning and knowledge; and in part out of necessity. We are into building a better future, and are not afraid to challenge established ways in order to do so: but the future will not be built on courage alone. It needs knowledge, and rigour.\n\nResearch has worked well for Edgeryders. It has allowed us, consistently, to generate and follow \"out there\" hunches \u2013 and some of these hunches have become permanent features of our lives as a community and a social enterprise. Our original ethnography on the transition of youth during the crisis led to the [unMonastery](https://edgeryders.eu/t/unhagiography-what-modern-day-social-innovators-can-learn-from-the-life-and-times-of-st-benedict/1882); investigating community response to health and social care needs generated [The Reef](https://edgeryders.eu/t/spawning-the-reef-brussels-re-inventing-communal-working-and-living-again/6239), where I now live: reflecting on the dynamics of radicalisation in the Southern Mediterranean led us to the nascent [Open Village](https://edgeryders.eu/c/openvillage) network. All of these were at the same time research results, prototypes, and waypoints on a profoundly meaningful journey for many of us.\n\nAs we get better at aggregating the ideas, skills and knowledge of the Edgeryders community \u2013 now 4,000 strong and counting \u2013 we believe can break new ground in several fields, and at a higher scale than that of today.\n\nTime to up our game. I am proud to announce that **we have decided to set up a new business unit within Edgeryders dedicated to research**. As everything else in Edgeryders, it will be a network, not a box in an org chart. We want to start it by **hiring a part-time research coordinator**. If you want to be part of a thriving, radical, constructive community on a journey to a better society, [consider applying](https://edgeryders.eu/t/part-time-research-coordinator/7223). \n\n_Photo credit:  Kris Williams on flickr.com_", "created_at": "2017-09-29 09:46:47.629256", "updated_at": "2017-11-11 14:34:09.402083", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 398, "wiki": false, "reads": 39, "score": 10767.8, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 4069, 4056, 3769], "is_private": false}, {"id": 59600, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 10785, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Moving this to the \"Workspace \u2192 Outreach & Dissemination\" category.

My background is in biochemistry and used to be a biology teacher for secondary school. Currently I am a researcher in the field of Open science with a focus on the maker movement and biohacking in the African context. I am also the President of the Association for the Promotion of Open Science in Haiti and Africa (APSOHA). \nThe maker movement and biohacking interest me deeply, due to their potential to overcome most of challenges the African Health system faces (e.g. many hospitals lack the basic materials, like microscopes). The possibility to modify hardware (e.g. connect a solar panel to a PCR machine and so on) is an advantage.\nIn order to promote this potential, I have organised this conference : \u201cBiohacking in the medical field: perspectives for developing countries\u201d, Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon, Mai 2017\nEven if the potential benefits are high, the maker movement and biohacking are subjects of critics, since : practices are very Western oriented, local knowledge is not acknowledged (it\u2019s classified as superstition or culture) and values are often not put into practice as they should. My paper entitled \u201cBenefit and the hidden face of the maker movement: Thoughts on its appropriation in African context\u201d  was written from the critic perspective.  \n\nIn Africa, the maker movement and biohacking is facing many difficulties: 1) the vision differs fundamentally from the usual makers/biohackers. When I ask Western biohackers \u201cwhy do you make this?\u201d, it\u2019s usually just for fun, like a hobby. In Africa, it is not the same, geeks are hacking to solve a problem, and to help people. 2) the machines that are usually made, are not prototyped in an African context. Although there are exceptions, often they are not useable. Therefore I promote biohacking in Africa in collaboration with electrotechnicians etc., so things can be tested and used. 3) The basic electronic components which are not easily affordable and available in Africa. Even the raspberry pi and Arduino are not easy to get; you have to order it from China.  4) The capitalistic system is another hurdle, because even if the prototype is good, there is standards defined by the WHO so that prototypes or materials to be used in hospitals, should fit with a standard. These standards are defined by the big companies. You cannot, as a biohacker, fight the establishment. They define the standard. This critique is addressed to the system managing health: it does not let people do it themselves. 5) Biohacking is not completely new to Africa, but it remains not supported by African Governments. People behind the project suffered a lot eg. The geek who made a cardiopad, was supported only when the state saw that media everywhere in the world, talk about this cardiopad invention (CNN, BBC, ...). \n\nHowever, some strategies and support can help to overcome these difficulties: 1) Government support, by the implementation of national policies on Open science. This is our biggest obstacle, not money or other things. 2) International organisations can be used as a vehicle of Open science. Because there is a kind of epistemic and colonial alienation which makes that our leaders trust in International Organization (because of money) and they are very open to discuss with white people. The reality is all things coming from the white people, West and NGO\u2019s are \u2018good\u2019, while they don\u2019t listen to their own people. 3) Due to these realities, most of the geeks engaged in biohacking are successful because they are connected with Western geeks and lab. \nThere are not many fablabs, makerspaces or \u2018protofablabs\u2019 in Africa. Some of them are promoted by personal efforts, association or companies. The Woelab in Togo is well known and has success. In Cameroon there is the fablab Ongola Lab, supported by Orange and Agence Universitaire de la Francophonie. But communities seem not deeply involved due to their perception of these spaces. That is why the science shop model has a lot of potential to change the African conception of fablab, rather than replicate the western model. \n\nIn my community, I conducted some project to give better life to people by hearing their needs and build solutions together. Like safe water to drink as I did in my village several years ago. I am not supported even by the state or by the rural council. If the pump is broken or whatever, I pay money to keep it going. I cannot ask villagers for money because they don\u2019t have it. \nI did other projects as well. Together with my wife, a teacher in nutrition, we did some research to reduce children malnutrition in rural zone; since many mothers cannot afford the right meals. We have created a formula using local ingredients, to help them give a balanced diet to their baby. All the work is freely accessible here (https://www.zenodo.org/record/57037/export/xm#.WcauGoxSxPY) and it\u2019s being used in our direct environment. We can help for a local problem, for 10 or 20 children, but cannot do it for the whole village. For a larger impact, it needs to be spread. We don\u2019t get the support we need to do this.\n\nA powerful weapon is education. Imagine: introduce biohacking in the curriculum. What would happen after 10 years, 20 years? How could we do this, since our governments seems inactive? For me the first thing is to hack textbooks by writing ourselves. I did it through this platform : http://www.fabrel.org/. \nWithout national and/or international support, I feel tired and not sure that I will continue. \nI\u2019d love to come to the OpenVillage Festival in October because I want to share my experience with others, continue to build a strong African community of biohacking, shape strategies for the use of Open science in healthcare and mostly, learn from others\u2026", "created_at": "2017-09-29 10:46:26.840806", "updated_at": "2018-01-24 03:35:55.015842", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 979, "wiki": false, "reads": 30, "score": 773.0, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3769, 3, 4103, 1935, 3782, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29616, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 2857, "post_number": 13, "raw": "<b>Dina interview her or even better ask her to tell us about her</b>\n\n<span>experience here?

People do not really keep profiles up-to-date.\n\nSemantic networks are a better bet. Once we have some orderly SSN\u00a0data, we can link people to ethno codes via content authored. For example, user John authored post \"Communities from offline to online\" that has been associated the codes \"community\", \"facilitation\" and \"conflict management\". You could then ask the SSN questions like \"give me everyone who has at least 3 codes in common with John\". @melancon is working on this, and we should have an implementation on opencare data in a few months.\u00a0\n\nWe will not be able to do this on the whole of the Edgeryders conversation, not in the short and medium run. At 1,000 participants and over 20,000 comments it is too expensive to code entirely. But opencare is a significant subset: we already have 150 unique participants, with some 230 long-form posts and challenge responses and over 1,600 comments. In the long run, we could use machine learning: the human coded sections of the conversation double up as training data for classifiers. Once the classifiers have evolved, we can have them code the rest of Edgeryders. Maybe.

Create templates for the different kinds of research data-gathering events that you plan to have (e.g. one for in-person events, one for online events, and one for interviews) and save them in this Consent Process Manual. This work is already well on its way in the manual. **Update them consistently here**. \n\n2. Any conversation around editing the **general** procedure should be had here and immediately implemented in the Consent Process Manual. \n\n3. Any conversation around the **specifics** of the meeting itself (these should only be minor tweaks to each form --- if they bring up larger issues that you see potentially coming up in future events, they need to be discussed and documented here). \n\n4. Each specific instance of the form we use should be saved in the same place to create a database (e.g. a shared Google Drive folder, or a series of links on this Consent Process Manual, either way linked directly to this manual itself).\n\nThis way, we can make sure that we are building upon the work we have done instead of duplicating it, that we are doing things in an open, consistent, and well-documented way, and not making on-the-fly decisions about research ethics. \n\nPinging @alberto @nadia @johncoate @noemi @MariaEuler, and please ping anyone else who has been involved (@LauraRoddy, @andreja?)", "created_at": "2020-08-17 16:25:01.439283", "updated_at": "2020-08-17 16:27:29.777004", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 274, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 26.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [81880], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 77575, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 13690, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\nDear community,\n\nHere a short overview of some of the currently ongoing conversations.

I created a new section 4.1, following up on the intuition that the number of codes needed to describe a conversation scales more slowly than the conversation itself. I also used this to teach myself some basic Pandas and how to use JuPyter with Anaconda. @markomanka had this really intriguing intuition of [ethno coding as lossy compression](https://edgeryders.eu/t/annotations-vs-codes-time-series/7859/3?u=alberto), and that would deserve some comments, but I am out of my depth here. Maybe @melancon can do that instead.\n\n2. Rip Amelia's walkthrough off section 3.2 and move it to section 4 (section 3.2 could end at \"0.711\"). The first part of Amelia's text, dealing with a filtered graph (maybe up to \"doing work on the issues\"), could move onto 4.2, replacing some of my own text there (\"Consider for example the cluster...\". The second part, that zooms in, (\"A colleague of this decision-maker\") could go into 4.3, again replacing my text. Assigned to @amelia.\n\n3. The whole walkthrough needs a re-examination, because it is written in terms of the Graphryder software (\"clicking on the edge, one sees...\") rather than in terms of SSNA as a method.  @amelia\n\n4. And of course we need to decide whether to update both the walkthrough and Figure 4 to the new data. I would say yes, I think the walkthrough would not change much. @amelia for the walkthrough, @alberto for the picture.\n\n5. Section 3 needs updating with the most recent figures and network stats. This would be @jason_vallet.\n\n6. A new section needs to be added (perhaps after 4.1; it would become the new 4.2). with Guy and Jason's latest work.

The issue is that A BP requires several weeks or months while time is our scarcest resource. Also, the majority of successful entrepreneurs changed their BP along the way, so why wasting time and energy writing something that will not survive the first contact with the customers since it\u2019s built on guesses?*\n\n*So, at this stage you need business planning and not BP. This would help you avoid the innovator\u2019s bias and to get emotionally attached to an idea that has not been tested and validated.*\n\n*Here\u2019s a very interesting video of Steve Blank the godfather of leanstartup methodology in which he explains why no business plan survives the first contact with customers: https://youtu.be/_eUoae9lHpY*\n\n*So, business planning takes 1 day and it helps you to have a single diagram of your business or a 1-page \u2018living\u2019 business plan you can continually update. This can be a business model canvas (BMC) or a LC.*\n\n*Now, why I recommend that you prepare a LC instead of a BMC? Actually, LC was created by Asch Maurya, an entrepreneur who was frustrated with the BMC because he finds it descriptive, \u201ctoo simple\u201d and it doesn\u2019t explain how to gain learning to move from idea to success. So he made an adaption of the BMC by changing the content of 4 blocks.*\n\n*To find out more about it, here\u2019s a link to a video in which Maurya explains the difference between BMC and LC: https://youtu.be/obX5yjFWnIM*\n\n*So now, how to fill out the canvas? Where to start?*\n\n*Here\u2019s the recommended sequence to fill out the canvas.*\n\n![LC%20sequence|690x483](upload://ge6hfBl5HKtNOQTyHB45FQY9R0H.jpeg) \n*Our starting point should always be the customers and the problem they have. Then we should move to our value proposition and how the solution that we offer solves the problem through 3 features at maximum.*\n\n*Next you have the channels or touch points to reach the customers when it comes to raise awareness, to sell and deliver the product and to ensure customer service. Then, the revenue streams and cost structure and finally, the key metrics (to measure the success of your business) and the unfair competitive advantage.*\n\n* Here\u2019s a video that explains how you can create a LC: https://youtu.be/FjB_e7UO1hc*\n\n*So what next for you?*\n\n*Your job is to fill out the LC with your hypotheses to test them later one.*\n\n*You don\u2019t have to test all the LC\u2019s hypotheses but the most important ones, this is why I recommend that you use a validation board (VB) to get ready for the customer interviews.*\n\n*You find the VB template attached to this post. Here\u2019s a link to a video on how to use it: https://youtu.be/HhoducyStMw*\n\n*At this stage, you only have to write down the hypotheses about the customer, solution and problem from your LC once created.*\n\n*At the end of the Lab we had a very interesting interaction of Q&A. Questions were about how to fill the LC.*\n\n*As an example, [ **@ayari.taha** ](https://edgeryders.eu/u/ayari.taha) asked about the best revenue streams model given that the customer can be doctors or end users, i.e. patients. In this respect, I answered that if you have more than one customer segment, it\u2019s possible to have different revenue model for each customer segment. Also, within the same customer segment such as doctors, I advised Taha at this stage to set the hypothesis that he considers best based on his current knowledge and to test it later on when he will conduct customer interviews because the answer must come from the customer who will pay for the solution.*\n\n*Another example, we got also another interesting question from [ **@HadeerGhareeb** ](https://edgeryders.eu/u/hadeerghareeb) about the unfair competitive advantage. Since her product is a card game, she asked if the quality of the card printing can be considered as an unfair competitive advantage. I answered no since the competitors can use the same technology to offer the same quality of the cards however, updating the game on a regular basis by adding new questions can be an unfair advantage since the competitors cannot copy it.*\n\nThe main insights from the Q&A is that you should prepare a LC for each customer segment if you have more than one and if they are different in term of problem to be solved and also if you have a multisided platform. \n\nA special thank to all the people having attends the lab and I hope that you found it helpful and useful.\n\nWish you all the best!\n\nWajdi\n\n[Lab3 Presentation.pdf|attachment](upload://pc445rnEqNLTsOaQBmd756WzUd.pdf) (2.5 MB) [Validation_Board.pdf|attachment](upload://9YVIOGFmaDNyciejKz0G6nsrQ3.pdf) (379.8 KB) [lean-canvas.pdf|attachment](upload://hz0xwYij4ISvg5bugwtQCSmMU8P.pdf) (197.4 KB)", "created_at": "2019-12-30 19:50:44.249064", "updated_at": "2020-07-20 13:36:34.573213", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 994, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 527.6, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5538, 8, 5547, 6116, 6132], "is_private": false}, {"id": 40675, "user_id": 1003, "topic_id": 7895, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n1) I created a new page on the miniwebstite http://opencare.cc/conference/documentation\n\n2) the menu for the Conference in Milano is \n- title: CONFERENCE\n  url: http://opencare.cc/conference\n  sublinks:\n    - title: PROGRAM\n      url: http://opencare.cc/conference\n    - title: CONFERENCE LIVE\n      url: http://opencare.cc/conference/live\n    - title: CONFERENCE DOCUMENTATION\n      url: http://opencare.cc/conference/documentation\n    - title: DIGITAL KIT\n      url: http://opencare.cc/conference/digitalkit\n    - title: CALL FOR SOLUTIONS\n      url: http://opencare.cc/callforsolutions\n    - title: ORGANIZER\n      url: http://opencare.cc/conference/organizer\n\n3) here is the playlist with the videos streamed:  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu2U-Du2fnKs3CEg9jif0EINWvMAkd8eZ\n\n4) here some pics https://www.flickr.com/photos/wemake_cc/", "created_at": "2017-12-21 13:53:13.601648", "updated_at": "2018-05-08 15:35:39.941222", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 109, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 42.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [854], "is_private": false}, {"id": 49681, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 9061, "post_number": 69, "raw": "[quote=\"amelia, post:63, topic:9061\"]\nAmerican Sociological Association\n[/quote]\n\n\nOk, so I succeeded with natbib.

In the recent days, @nadia  and the team have had different discussions with the different stakeholders about this exciting initiative. The discussions were quite fruitful, and helped to rethink how to start implementing the project and drawing young entrepreneurs, collaborators and mentors in to OCI Lab.\n\nAs you know, OCI Lab is the continuity of the Open Village project in the MENA region, which was initiated by Edgeryders\u2019 community. This community of changemakers from all backgrounds, coming together from around the globe, connected online, all working to support each other in bringing the positive change to their communities and so the world, this is one of the most important added-value that OCI Lab is offering for social entrepreneurs and young people in the MENA region. Now, we want to emphasize this particularity. That is why we believe that the upcoming Edgeryders\u2019 festival in 19-29 November, would be the perfect occasion for the kick off of OCI Lab. All parties, with whom we have had discussions, agreed on this.  \n\n@zmorda  and I, have had a brainstorming with @nadia  last week around this. We are thinking of organizing a series of Hackathons in different countries of the MENA region. In these 3 to 4 days Hackathons, we will be presenting three or four challenges, and participating teams will have to work on developing viable solutions to address at least one of these challenges. OCI Lab team, based in Tunisia, will coordinate all the hackathons, whether by physical presence or virtually through online calls.\n\nIn the beginning of all hackathons, we will have calls with all participants to present Edgeryders and OCI Lab, the challenges, the process, the expected outputs from each team, and what the winners will benefit from after the hackathons. \n\nDuring the Hackathon, we organize several 1-2 hours online workshops (webinars) in order to equip the participants with new knowledge and tools that they might need when developing their project proposals and solutions. Here, I am thinking of you @noemi , @matthias , @alberto , @hugi  and all who want to join us (topics could include: Future communities\u2019 development, Blockchain, community management, AI, Data science, ethnography, how to go internationally, alternative currencies/economy, etc.), but we should deliver interesting topics (usually around IT, economics and development) for participants.  \n\nBy the end of the hackathon, each team should come up with:\n\n* A project idea (A business Model Canvas)\n* A prototype / Demo for their solution\n* A plan of action to develop their MVP, with clear milestones and a clear budget for each milestone\n\nOCI Lab and Edgeryders team will select the most relevant projects from all hackathons. I am thinking of up to 10 projects, but again this depends on the number of hackathons to be organized, the number of final projects presented and their relevance to the challenges. All the selected projects will go into the mentoring process through the community calls as explained before. These teams will also have a budget available to benefit from, in order ton at least, develop their MVPs as described in their plan of action, and eventually business plans to raise further funding from other donors or investors in the future. That is why we need also your thoughts about what challenges to choose, as this could help the project have better access to funding opportunities. Now, we will have a budget up to 15k $ to support the selected teams.

Like many others, I struggled to navigate a difficult situation. It was not just the tight money, the hollow punditry, the self-importance of myopic leaders. It was the sudden questioning of basic building blocks of our societies. Is debt bad, after all? \"Every child is born with tens of thousands of dollars in national debt\", admonished financial journalists. Or is it good? \"A web of reciprocal debt *is* society, without mutual obligations people will turn their back on each other\", observed anthropologists. Is economic collapse fundamental? What do we know about it? Do we need all the stuff we buy, anyway? If not, what it is we need?\n\n \n\nWhat should I do, I wondered? Support reformist candidates at the next elections? Are there any, or are all political agendas different finishings of the same basic mix? Rebel? And what to think of all these new movements, with strange names like Occupy Wall Street, M-25 or Los Indignados? What of the sudden wave of tech activism, with crypto parties at one end and infrastructure for massive untraceable leaks at the other?\n\n \n\n\"What should I do?\" was the wrong question.\n\nNo one cares what I do. This is the real world, not some hero fantasy. And the real world is a set of interlocked complex adaptive systems. All important dynamics are collective, emergent. My personal choices make zero differences.\n\nWhat made sense was to *listen*, and try to learn. This was likely to be the best investment, for three reasons.\n\n**First: people are smart and resourceful** . Confronted with a crisis, they tend to step into the breach, invent, improvise. And they were. Alessia spun a web of small businesses who refused to pay protection money to mobsters. Matthias was producing a monumental collection of open source knowledge for autonomous living, from the scale of the household to that of the planet. Anthony was creating an open source protocol for producing human insulin. And on it went, idea after idea, project after project. Sharing economy. Crypto currencies. Urban agriculture. Network bartering. Co-living and co-working (which I [now do myself](https://edgeryders.eu/t/the-reef-vs-lockdown-living-in-a-co-housing-space-in-a-time-of-pandemic/13023)).\n\n \n\n**Second, people are generous and well-meaning** . Rebecca Solnit's [magnificent work](http://www.rebeccasolnit.net/book/a-paradise-built-in-hell/) confirms it: in a disaster, cohesive, super-efficient mutual aid communities come instantly to life. Though often struggling themselves, the folks that showed up at Edgeryders' digital door went out of their way to support each other, give hard-won knowledge away, help others to learn.\n\n \n\n**And third, there is a specific locus in society where most of this happens** . At the center of society, where most of the power and the money, there is little incentive for systemic change. Everything is going great. At its outskirts, where the poorest and most vulnerable people live, there is little capacity. When you live hand to mouth, it is hard to invest time and energy in anything beyond immediate needs. But between the two, there is a liminal space where people struggle, but maintain some agency. They have both the incentive and the capacity to attempt systemic change. We call this \"the edge\" of society.\n\n \n\nSo, Edgeryders came together in 2011-2012 as a listening exercise in a crisis-ridden Europe, underwritten by the Council of Europe. We found the expected resourcefulness and generosity. But we also found something we had not been looking for: a shared sense of opportunity. In a crisis, the center becomes weaker, softer, more permeable. At the same time, the people of the edge, more rugged, find themselves with more agency. Suddenly, people were listening to us. We could try to use the crisis as a raft, to carry us from the broken old world to a better, saner one.\n\n \n\n**That attempt failed: the old world is still here** . But in 2013, as the crisis started to recede, a core of dedicated contributors had emerged. I was no longer alone: there was a \"we\". And we decided to spin it off into its own company. We structured it as an utopian experiment. No debt, no central command (\"no plan is the plan\"), no office, no work hours. Digital workspaces accessible to everyone on the web (\"working out loud\"). Relentless do-ocracy (\"who does the work calls the shots\"). To its founders' surprise, the company is still around, and growing. And it is doing work that feels meaningful, studying (and trying to influence) community health care, European populism, the Internet's evolution. We are working on a project of semi-sufficient urban co-living, [The Reef](Https://thereef.brussels), and on a space for experimenting with completely different new economic systems, the [Sci-Fi Economics Lab](https://scifieconomicslab.net). \n\n \n\nNow we are in a new crisis, even more disruptive than the one that birthed us. On a personal level, we are all affected. **But, as a collective, it feels like coming home** . Edgeryders-the-community looks the same, though it is much larger now. The same sense of feverish grassroots activity; the same aspiration to a fairer, saner world. The same tools \u2013 cheap tech, knowledge sharing, and above all reliance on each other. The same disenchantment with the powerful structures of the center \u2013 governments, business, politicians.\n\n \n\nBut Edgeryders-the-company is very different. We are more experienced, more battle-tested than in 2011. We have better tech, better processes, better access and a way better team. The pandemic did not even slow us down much: we were *already* native to [distributed collaboration](/t/11263). And so, amidst the fake news fury, the posturing of politicians and pundits, the longing for loved ones we cannot see, **some of us feel a strange solace** . Grim as it is, this is where we are meant to be. Work needs doing, and we can help, in the company of people we love and respect. What more could we ask for?\n\n*Photo credit: [Mark Iocchelli](https://www.flickr.com/photos/iocchelli/14872237290/in/photolist-oEd71j-KFS26W-26qiH2Q-W8jhfE-Ju7zqE-6RVDDY-eBMyx2-KMQMux-26gtTj6-BRXb5B-27ozDXL-22BZDYb-ohW4oQ-21u6cxE-DfK66W-Nf6mBg-GDWWhD-QLt6LA-8brUSn-FAWdtS-arC6cr-TqR1EA-PS9K1q-q35mMV-nAWyc7-8bvb4y-egwEFV-24TuxDe-23JRYEr-eFJwNR-6AKaJF-JFKjLg-SaiE3J-4tv6Y5-G7nELp-az7Jsq-5ePNeG-2d27ZDz-2fz8CxT-o2cVce-pXjnsU-4oe8b9-gSpiej-jM2jcj-8bvaT7-no8Yjh-GvLDhx-4ThMNx-bufMJ5-SaiEzL)*", "created_at": "2020-05-07 16:38:50.322146", "updated_at": "2020-05-10 15:01:45.529088", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1087, "wiki": false, "reads": 34, "score": 2431.8, "like_count": 17, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 5698, 1877, 5, 6444, 4096, 2303, 3, 4934, 200, 347, 428, 4968, 104, 5209, 4795, 6489], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33745, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 6594, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/0/0629d2c3ea31ded6b69d738a7686246118e7c361.png\" width=\"689\" height=\"463\">\n\nHow can a \u201csmart swarm\u201d come together to provide sustainable, safe and accountable healthcare to every community across the globe?

So maybe these servers can serve as a delay-tolerant network (as trythis calls it) for collecting and distributing long-form audio and video stories from villagers, recorded on smartphones? If that is not practical, then at least digital versions of the village newspapers that exist in many villages here.\n\nThen, whenever somebody visits another village, they would charge their USB thumbdrive with the current village's latest storyset, and plug the thumbdrive in at the target location, which will push the updates, and pull the stories from that village. Audio stories could then also make their way to FM radio stations in that and other villages, to be cut and broadcasted \u2026\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-12 17:45:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:41.428650", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 303, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2551, 2736], "is_private": false}, {"id": 79139, "user_id": 4683, "topic_id": 13906, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Dear All\n\nWell, here my (= 65y, STEM education, first contact with IT was when we used TTYs and punch cards) short comment:\n\n(1) I dislike the App because I do not run around with an open Bluetooth connection and location services switched on .\n(2) I downloaded the App and noticed that it is easy to switch it on/off.\n(3) I plan to use the App in circumstances when I have to trade off 'close distance to many unknown persons' against '(1)'\n(4) Condition '(3)' will be met seldom considering my current place of living & style of life.\n\nHence, the App is like my bicycle helmet.

But something got lost in the process, when our vocabulary was appropriated by people and orgs with a centralist agenda (large corps, tenured academics, governments), who were in it for the funding or the market share. This is not bad per se, but it becomes bad when bad projects run by unscrupulous people made scorched earth of our ideas (example: <a href=\"http://www.cottica.net/2011/08/10/e-participations-unavoidable-fiasco/\">the 500 EUR blog posts</a> were a blow to the credibility of online citizen participation, a concept dear to my heart that, I think, would need a few more years of underground, ultralow cost experimentation before the EC starts to fund 2 million EUR projects).\u00a0\n\nNone of this says anything about ICT4D, but it does explain why I, sometimes, seem to slip into cynicism.

If memory serves, Italy (never a model of virtue anyway), divided the old electricity company into:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>a generation arm, running powers stations. Power generation was made a competitive market: you can build your own power station and start selling, though of course all standards are heavily regulated.</li>\n\n<li>a distribution arm, running the power grid. The grid is largely a natural monopoly, so this part is owned by a state-owned company.</li>\n\n<li>a \"last mile\" commercial arm. This was also made competitive.</li>\n\n<li>a \"electricity stock exchange\", with operators who generate electricity sell KWH to those selling it to final consumers. Nowadays this is quite sophisticated; for example, some companies offer users electricity coming 100% from renewable sources, which means that they need to be able to buy renewable KWHs on the stock market.</li>\n\n<li>on top of all that, they stuck a regulation authority modelled on OFGEM in the UK.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nWhat I'm getting at is that there is no simple way to \"solve\" the problem, even without invoking foreign interests \u2013 which could very well be at work here.

But things really can't go on like that \u2026 which is a topic for a different occasion.\n\nSo, for the date. A combination with that third community workshop sounds really good to me. I [see](/t/10674/14) that the third community workshop will be 2019-11-28 16:00 - 21:00 in Metrolab. That seems to imply it's not inside a candidate building.\n\nIn that case, it seems better to hold the technical sprint 1-2 days _before_ that third workshop, because then we can showcase some of the work we did there during the community workshop.

Still, I am lacking clarity and understanding about the conditions of my participation. It says \"Passes and travel support are offered on a case by case basis, so the sooner you get involved the better.\" I understand that unfortunately, I came in quite late and that my post hasn't attracted much interest either. \n\nNevertheless, I would be happy to offer a workshop during the Festival, if such an opportunity is still available. Please let me know, how to further proceed from here.\n\nI would prepare something about the nexus between peace studies and health studies. One of the fathers of Peacebuilding, Johan Galtung, argues that the triangle diagnosis-prognosis-therapy can be applied. \"There is the common idea of a system (of actors, of cells), of well-states and ill-states. The word pairs \u201chealth-disease\u201d from health studies and \u201cpeace-violence\u201d from peace studies can be seen as specifications of these very general labels.\"\n\nBoth states of being actually need **diagnosis** (or analysis), not only violence and disease. Peace and health also have their conditions and their contexts. They may be different from the conditions for violence and disease, but could also be related to them. Galtung argues that a condition for peace could be an equitable relation, but we have to factor in the violence in a non-exploitative system, if something goes wrong within one single actor. Thus, a condition for health is a stable equilibrium of key parameters of the human body, and yet one cell or a colony of cells may go wrong, starting growing out of all proportions for instance.\n\nIf the system falls out of its \u201cwell-state\u201d and shows symptoms of ill-states coming up, or they are already there, the question to be answered in a **prognosis** is whether the system is capable of self-restoration back to its well-state, or whether some other type of intervention is needed.           Galtung warns that and intervention from the outside should not be identified with therapy. First, it may on the balance make the system worse (Do No Harm); Secondly, living beings may also be capable of providing self-therapy.  Thirdly, self-restoration does not necessarily mean conscious, deliberate intervention. The system may \u201ctake care of itself\u201d. Our bodies have that amazing \ncapacity to restore equilibrium through incredibly complex mechanisms that we have hardly even started to understand, leave alone are capable of influencing. The interesting question to ask is how to provide positive conditions for those restorative functions.\n\nFinally, when it comes to **therapy**, meaning by that \"deliberate efforts by Self or Other to move the system back again to some well-state, or at least in that general direction\". When we talk about the distinction between negative and positive peace, we should also keep in mind the difference between curative and preventive therapy. All four of them stand for well-states. There is no (or very little) disease or violence around. The systems are (almost) symptom-free, but in the negative case that is about all that can be said about them. The equilibrium is so unstable that a (minor) incident of hate speech can bring the system into an ill-state. In the negative case the equilibrium is more stable, meaning there is more capacity of self-restoration, even if the system may not be entirely symptom-free. Curative therapy aims at the former, preventive therapy at the latter. Both are needed for health and peace.", "created_at": "2017-09-29 16:15:23.588001", "updated_at": "2017-09-29 16:15:23.588001", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 584, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 50.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [37016], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31353, "user_id": 3310, "topic_id": 6167, "post_number": 17, "raw": "<b>time for the paper?</b>\n\nDear @noemi\n\ni'm reading through the posts about the paper and probably we should try to connect the theory ( @ezio_manzini 's <a href=\"/t/meeting-notes-how-digital-spaces-and-online-interaction-foster-action/6159/11\">matrix</a>) with the practice (the 10-11 events cited <a href=\"/t/meeting-notes-how-digital-spaces-and-online-interaction-foster-action/6159/3\">here</a>) before Bordeaux's meeting.\n\nHere is a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZCQL-PmMKQ7pX6Kqj1JTI0mGZGZHt_1tI7VyrOIU_30/edit?usp=sharing\">shared file</a> with Ezio's matrix to make some improvements, maybe adding the events and see how they slide from conversations to actions...

Could just be mental chemtrail but it interests me, so I thought I'd share - see if anyone else is interested in playing with it...\n\nWhen it comes to discussions that involve internet ( infrastructure, technologies, businesses etc), I often get a feeling of being stuck in strange now-space where everything is supposed to be moving fast, but is somehow not moving at all.\n\n I couldn't put my finger on what was bothering me about this till @hugi brought me along to a fascinating lecture at the Long Now foundation by an archeologist who had explored the evolution of the ancient silk road (Hugi can describe it better). \n\nHanging out hung out with archeologists like @sander explodes open the context because things look so very different from a distance of 10,000 years. \n\nThe choice of what time perspective we adopt by default is not neutral. It encodes a whole set of values. \n\nIn the discussion around what path Europe should take into the digital future, the choice seems to be between authoritarian surveillance-enabled control (China) or Feral capitalism (US).\n\nPerhaps it is rather a time perspective question? Is there a European perspective on time?\n\n### Do feel free to share your own thoughts in a comment below!

If someone has super high levels of cells with micronuclei, one should try to see if there are any potential exposures that could explain the finding, ideally.  (not too easy!?)\n\nI am not sure if we can really hope that citizen access to all genetic info is likely to be widespread, in the face of IP, however, any time soon.\nThis is a very big issue!  \nFor instance all the mutations linked to BRCA1 that are patented by Myriad Genetics are not available readily, because they want to use them to diagnose breast cancers!  However, this is a great disservice to people and for health, because actually, as a DNA repair factor, BRCA1/2 mutations greatly increase the risk of many cancers, not just breast cancer, and including prostate cancer in men.  \nBy not distributing this information generally, it takes away from the broad realisation of how important prevention really is (if you avoid damage to your DNA, you have less need of repair - and repair can actually end up fixing new - potentially worse - mutations in certain cases - nhej\u2026 I could go on and on\u2026)  Study on how BRCAs are involved in repair is of course on-going, but again the human data are not readily accessible.\nThis is a sorry state of affairs!\nI would love to have a data base of all the BRCA mutations to double check that they are all simply loss of function (or not?! dom neg??), but haven\u2019t got this info yet, for instance. \n\nHope there are others interested in discussing such points during the meeting!\n\nLooking forward!", "created_at": "2017-09-29 16:12:15.529798", "updated_at": "2017-09-29 16:12:15.529798", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 535, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 52.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [37147], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 40357, "user_id": 4229, "topic_id": 7837, "post_number": 19, "raw": "Hi everyone, I\u2019m half English/half Irish from London but chose Matera as my home 10 years ago.

Respecting the opportunities for providing care we can say that we thought about volunteering or giving situational Italian classes to the people of the Bovisa and Dergamo neighborhoods and also skill sharing with them.\n\nIn this first step we envisioned\u00a0a place where people could share their leisure time to help someone else.

For this reason our proposal aims to connect the needs and the desires of both students and shop owners. Students could experience the shops as places to work on their projects, get help from experts and use professional tools, while employees could acquire more visibility and get more customers. All this could happen through a powerful exchange of passions, knowledge and skills, in a stimulating atmosphere to co-work and to share meaningful stories.

You can now let Open Ethnographer suggest codes that your fellow ethnographers applied throughout the same coding project (here, #ethno-poprebel).\n\nTo do that, you first have to choose your coding project once (and then every time when you move to work on a different project). To do so:\n\n1. Go the [Open Ethnographer interface](https://edgeryders.eu/annotator).\n2. Click \u201cUser Settings \u2192 [your user] \u2192 Edit User Settings\u201d.\n3. Under \u201cDiscourse tag\u201d, select the tag applied to posts in your coding project, namely `ethno-poprebel` in this case.\n4. Click \u201cUpdate User Settings\u201d.\n\nNote that, as a side effect, Open Ethnographer will not include all of your own codes in the suggestions, but only those that you used before in the current coding project. You can always switch back to the old behavior or \"show only my own codes independent of coding project, and nothing of others\" by selecting \"no tag\" in the above setting.\n\n(This is also [documented in the manual](https://edgeryders.eu/t/-/6811#heading--6-4) now.)\n\n\n### Background\n\nThis implements what Amelia requested at the beginning of this topic (see the quote below). Just that code names are not proposed additionally in English if a code name of the same code has already been included in the coding user's language. (We'll get that fixed, but it should be a minor issue to be aware of for now.)\n\n[quote=\"amelia, post:1, topic:13097\"]Ideally, when typing in codes in English, the box will display code suggestions from across the POPREBEL projects (so, by any other POPREBEL ethnographer, instead of only individual\u2019s code or previous system where all codes from all projects were suggested). Depending on how the dual-code function works, suggestions in the native language should ideally include all codes that have been assigned in the project in that language.[/quote]", "created_at": "2020-05-20 15:36:56.798681", "updated_at": "2020-05-20 16:01:30.185000", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 363, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 36.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [73402], "is_reply_to": [73402], "is_liked_by": [3323, 6339], "is_private": false}, {"id": 51564, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 9438, "post_number": 7, "raw": "For those in Berlin these days:\n\nBauhaus Imaginista - free conference on Populism and contemporary issues in politics, this weekend https://www.hkw.de/en/programm/projekte/veranstaltung/p_147379.php \n\nTomorrow, a free workshop with Saskia Sassen about European cities and regions - and a lot more in the program of the festival https://www.facebook.com/events/259138691477040/", "created_at": "2019-03-12 08:55:55.069824", "updated_at": "2019-03-12 08:56:08.325722", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 57, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 16.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4096], "is_private": false}, {"id": 59763, "user_id": 4986, "topic_id": 10847, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Sharing is caring!\n\nTwitter\n\n[\"Ghost Theater of Stepanakert\"]\n\nIn an internationally unrecognised territory in the south Caucasus, an art festival will take place with a focus on trying to revive the area known as Nagorno-Karabakh.

Introduction</span>\n\n</h1>\n\n<span>Edgeryders\u2019 Future Makers Nepal project was initiated by UNDP Nepal </span><span>with the aim to research</span><span>, contact and connect alternative leaders in Nepal using an online platform. As part of this work, we had to carry a \u201cmapping of existing virtual dialogue spaces in Nepal\u201d, the findings of which we detail in this report.</span>\n\n<span>Our start of the work in Nepal coincided with the 25 April 2015 earthquake, after which a huge number of existing web-based dialogue and collaboration spaces was re-purposed for community-driven disaster response, and a similar number of new spaces and initiatives was created for this purpose. These were the most vibrant online communities of alternative leaders in Nepal in the weeks past the earthquake, so we have put particular emphasis on mapping them in the following report.</span>\n\n<span>We find and analyze in detail how after the 25 April earthquake, mostly young volunteers </span><span>came to the fore</span><span>, creating their own dialogue and collaboration spaces and on-the-ground initiatives to tackle the effects of the disaster. Effectively, a spontaneous movement of community-driven earthquake response initiatives formed. About half of the initiatives involved formed spontaneously after the earthquake, and a portion of them will transform into new, sustainable dialogue and collaboration spaces in Nepal;s civil society, beyond the current context of earthquake relief. We were lucky to be able to capture the formation of these nascent dialogue and collaboration spaces in this mapping report.</span>\n\n<span>The analysis is devised based on an online database that is created for keeping track of people and organizational initiatives involved in the disaster response activities. It focuses on aspects such as nature of the initiatives, focus of the initiatives, the activity location and the scale of activity. Offline and online dialogue between citizen driven disaster response initiatives and alternative leaders form the basis of analysis in assessing the level of community-engagement. </span><span>The online dialogue spearheads the understanding of the importance of grass-root efforts in the disaster response. It serves as a unique platform to discuss and learn how people work and coordinate at times of crisis, what motivates them and how they reflect upon their initiatives. </span><span>This ultimately helps</span><span>\u00a0in strengthening and developing a stronger civil society base which can devise constructive solutions to problems, develop sustainable collaboration between people and relief organizations and prepare Nepal for unforeseen circumstances in the future.</span>\n\n<span>This report provides an overview of some of</span><span>\u00a0the</span><span>\u00a0community driven responses to </span><span>the recent crisis</span><span>\u00a0in Nepal. For the purpose of this study we define \u2018community-driven responses to disaster\u2019 as any disaster</span><span>-related</span><span>\u00a0response activities that </span><span>are</span><span>\u00a0not initiated by professionals officially </span><span>designated to do relief work </span><span>(including security forces, government</span><span>al structures</span><span>, UN system, INGOs and NGOs among others). The Future Makers Nepal team did a preliminary mapping of </span><span>121</span><span>\u00a0volunteer driven disaster responses that emerged in Nepal in a span of a month following the earthquake.</span><span>\u00a0The following findings are a result of a two-week-long analysis of the data available online, combined with conclusions derived from informal meetings with people engaged in the relief efforts.</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<h1 class=\"c11\">\n\n<a id=\"h.txsl6dtrz1pj\" name=\"h.txsl6dtrz1pj\"></a><span>2. Situation Overview</span>\n\n</h1>\n\n<span>A 7.8 magnitude earthquake that struck Nepal on</span><span>\u00a0the</span><span>\u00a025</span><span>\u00a0</span><span>April 2015 and was followed by numerous aftershocks left thousands dead, injured and properties worth millions ravaged. The earthquake also destroyed</span><span>\u00a0some of the</span><span>\u00a0most important cultural heritage of Nepal. The government report shows that over 35 of the 75 districts are affected in the Central and Western Regions including the Kathmandu Valley and </span><span>14 of these districts were identified as \u2018priority affected districts\u2019</span><span>\u00a0depending upon the severity of the damage. Reportedly, Gorkha, Dhading, Sindhupalchok, Rasuwa, Nuwakot, Bhaktapur, Kathmandu, Lalitpur are the districts that are highly affected by the earthquake. As of 31 May, the Home Ministry reported a total of 8,693 deaths, 22,221 people injured and over 505,000 homes fully destroyed and another 275,000 partially destroyed.</span><sup><a href=\"#ftnt2\" id=\"ftnt_ref2\" name=\"ftnt_ref2\">[2]</a></sup><span>\u00a0The earthquake also ravaged more than 70 percent of the cultural heritages of Nepal listed in the UNESCO heritage site.</span><sup><a href=\"#ftnt3\" id=\"ftnt_ref3\" name=\"ftnt_ref3\">[3]</a></sup><span>\u00a0In addition, the official estimates put forth by the World Health Organisation show that 8.1 million people out of a population of 28 million have been affected by the earthquake, amongst which 1.7 million are children.</span>\n\n<span>Nepal\u2019s Ministry of Education estimates that 23,644 classrooms have been damaged or destroyed, and an additional 10,922 classrooms have received minor damages in the priority affected districts alone.</span><sup><a href=\"#ftnt4\" id=\"ftnt_ref4\" name=\"ftnt_ref4\">[4]</a></sup><span>\u00a0For a country like Nepal, prior to the earthquake tackling an alarming number of issues pertaining to political tensions, slow economic progress, poverty, unemployment, energy crunch, among others, the task of rebuilding now turns out to be </span><span>a herculean one</span><span>. The country now faces another major setback in its development trajectory and what is needed at this hour of crisis is a good leadership and above all the collective strength of common people. </span>\n\n<span>However</span><span>, the way the young Nepalese took up the task of reaching out to the victims speaks a lot about the concern they have shown towards their society, thus </span><span>projecting</span><span>\u00a0a sense of natural \u2018community resilience\u2019. While majority of the people remained outside houses for numerous days, there were these certain groups of individuals and organizations that took charge. They worked day and night to give to the living by voluntarily rendering whatever support they could. Some crowd-sourced funds for immediate relief or transported relief materials to the affected areas, while others took up the task of setting up platforms for disseminating crucial information outside the traditional modes of communication, and a significant number of youths collaborated with government authorities. The preliminary mapping for this report recorded 121 voluntary disaster response initiatives out of probably more than 250 voluntary disaster response initiatives that have published anything online, and many more who did not. It will be years before Nepal recovers from this catastrophe, however, the country is fortunate to have motivated youths, bounded with an unprecedented sense of collective responsibility, community spirit and social consciousness to rebuild Nepal.</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<h1 class=\"c11\">\n\n<a id=\"h.3uys1on7avna\" name=\"h.3uys1on7avna\"></a><span>3. </span><span>Methods and Data</span>\n\n</h1>\n\n<span>The data pertaining to community-driven initiatives after the 25th of </span><span>April</span><span>\u00a0earthquake and subsequent aftershocks are gathered through online and offline sampling. Most of the data was extracted manually from publicly available, unstructured Internet content published by the respective initiatives. This method was fast and efficient to stay within project constraints, and lead to relatively complete results. The alternative of inviting initiatives to a survey would have lead to somewhat more exact data, but would have been slower, taking time away from actual relief efforts and thus only a low turnover could have been be expected.</span>\n\n<span>An online database of individuals and initiatives that were involved in various types of post-earthquake disaster response endeavours is devised to collect certain type of information the research focuses on. Based upon this dataset, initiatives are selected and featured in the Future Makers Nepal online platform through interviews and are invited to take part in the online dialogue that this virtual community supports. The method also uses case studies as a basis of qualitative analysis in examining the initiatives, their nature, scope and challenges. These case studies are further taken as a basis for formulating an analysis for the post- earthquake disaster response carried out by people and institutions. </span>\n\n<span>At this stage, the database contains 121 records of community-driven disaster response initiatives. Initiatives are further analyzed by devising categories to measure the intensity and diversity of their earthquake relief responses and recording this information in the database.</span>\n\n<span>The first criterion concerns the activities carried out by the community-driven initiatives. Categories for this are largely </span><span>aligned with the UN cluster system</span><span>\u00a0for comparability. However, sub-categories for activities have been added where required, allowing a more detailed analysis of interesting aspects not covered by a UN cluster system categorization. For instance, the information management category is further divided into crisis mapping and volunteer placement, and the relief supplies category is further segregated by type of supplies.</span>\n\n<span>The location of the initiatives has been analyzed on a district level. Where more specific information was not publicly available, initiatives that operate location-independent (e.g. fundraising campaigns) have been assigned the 14 </span><span>government designated priority affected districts.</span><sup><a href=\"#ftnt5\" id=\"ftnt_ref5\" name=\"ftnt_ref5\">[5]</a></sup>\n\n<span>The initiatives and projects are also analyzed based upon their nature, that is to say if they have emerged spontaneously following the 25th of April earthquake or if they derived from the pre-existing organization structures that diverted their focus after the earthquake.</span>\n\n<span>Finally, the scale of the initiatives has been recorded, using categories that could be easily inferred from publicly available information and are meant to gauge the internal coordination complexity of the initiatives; namely, if the initiative was an individual effort, or a work done by one team, multiple teams, or multiple teams using multiple base locations.</span>\n\n<h1 class=\"c11\">\n\n<a id=\"h.cnx8iernizxf\" name=\"h.cnx8iernizxf\"></a><span>4. </span><span>Findings</span>\n\n</h1>\n\n<h2 class=\"c11\">\n\n<a id=\"h.fuim2cg4kagu\" name=\"h.fuim2cg4kagu\"></a><span>4.1. Characteristics of Dialogue and Collaboration Initiatives</span>\n\n</h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">\n\n<span>Activit</span><span>ies</span>\n\n</h3>\n\n<span>Each community-driven earthquake response initiative was sorted into all types of response activity categories. </span><span>The current dataset shows the following significant clusters of activity:</span>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><span>Supplies </span><span>\u2013 </span><span>With 58 of 121 mapped initiatives (48</span><span>% approx.) covering this</span><span>, the immediate supply of relief materials was the most common choice of activity. Initiatives further differed by the selection of relief materials they provided (shelter supplies like tarps or tents, food supplies, health supplies incl. hygiene and medicinal articles, educational materials, housing reconstruction materials, and \u2018other supplies\u2019; </span><span>see image 1 for a breakdown</span><span>). Initiatives were only assigned a \u2018supplies\u2019 category if they simply provide materials to people in need, without using them further on location (like for example for building shelters).</span></li>\n\n<li><span>Information management</span><span>\u00a0\u2013 </span><span>About </span><span>41% of initiatives covered information management, making this the second most commonly chosen activity. It is interesting to note that there was a significant upsurge of an online community dedicated in post conflict disaster management. It was assigned for any relief-associated activity related to relief coordination, assessment, data collection and information sharing beyond the immediate needs of the own initiative. Crisis mapping (creating online and offline maps) and volunteer placement (matching volunteers with opportunities) were separated out into sub-categories as there were many individuals and institutions that focused their disaster response activities towards these. </span><span>Furthermore, </span><span>many</span><span>\u00a0</span><span>(62%) </span><span>of the information management endeavors were initiated by persons and organisations that came up spontaneously after the earthquake. Various people and initiatives also created an online record with contact numbers and hotlines of relevant government authorities, hospitals, medical clinics, blood donations and ambulance services.</span></li>\n\n<li><span>Fundraising</span><span>\u00a0\u2013 Fundraising turned out to be another mostly opted disaster response initiative which was voluntarily carried out by individuals and organisations. The finding shows 17% of initiatives (21 out of 121) taking up the task of crowdfunding campaigns for own or others\u2019 initiatives..

The </span><span>Rise of New Civil Society in Nepal?</span>\n\n</h2>\n\n<span>When it might have been thought that the country which was already in tatters due to its decade long Maoist conflict and the subsequent political turmoils, reeling problem of corruption and underdevelopment will further divulge in a situation of hopelessness following the recent natural disaster, it was fascinating to see the outpouring of citizen engagement and the rise of new community organisations. What made this rise of \u2018public sphere\u2019 more interesting is the nature of their emergence, that is to say the spontaneity of their rise in the wake of crisis. The findings show that 52% of the mapped organisations that were engaged in disaster response activities were the ones that already existed while 48% of initiatives emerged spontaneously after the crisis. There seems to be a significant number of voluntarily driven citizen engagement endeavors with their focus on supplying immediate relief materials and more importantly, on information management. This is heading towards an emergence of tech savvy, philanthropic new civic leadership. As per the findings, about half (29 of 58) of newly emerged initiatives tasked themselves with general information management </span><span>(</span><span>coordination and need assessment), and several more took on crisis mapping or volunteer placement, in most cases additionally. Based upon these findings we can see a rise of new civil society in Nepal: Besides the conventional civil society activities, largely related to politicised mass mobilisations, there is now a new model of self-directed citizen engagement. The next challenge that lies ahead is to enable this \u2018new public sphere\u2019 to effect lasting social change: rebuilding communities, rehabilitating victims and most importantly, reestablishing enduring trust </span><span>in </span><span>government by coordinating effectively with it.</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<h1 class=\"c11 c37\">\n\n<a id=\"h.poijg238t2mz\" name=\"h.poijg238t2mz\"></a><span>5. </span><span>Case studies: People and Initiatives Making a Difference</span>\n\n</h1>\n\n<span>Based upon the online dialogue</span><span>\u00a0that takes place on our edgeryders.eu platform, some of the surveyed initiatives are presented here in more depth as typical examples for different varieties of initiatives, differing by activities (here information management, health, fundraising and providing immediate relief supplies) and scale (here one or multiple teams).

Conclusion and Outlook</span>\n\n</h1>\n\n<h2 class=\"c11\">\n\n<a id=\"h.guep5ayvydcr\" name=\"h.guep5ayvydcr\"></a><span>6.1. Method Review</span>\n\n</h2>\n\n<span>The chosen method was reasonably effective and efficient to detect key characteristics of the community-driven disaster response movement after the earthquake in Nepal, including activities, location, group nature and scale. It also worked well to inform research questions for follow-up work. However, the nature of the data and data collection prevented us to work out some of the more subtle properties of the movement. Specifically, the limitations arose from:</span>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><span>Inexact data.</span><span>\u00a0Since data was collected from publicly available sources, and these publications were made in an unstructured and ad-hoc way in a post-disaster scenario, data would be missing in some cases and be inexact in others. This was countered by choosing a high granularity level (location by district instead of VDC, scale in 5 levels instead of number of collaborators etc.). But consequentially, analysis was limited to this granularity level as well. For example, it is not possible to give an estimate of the amount of relief work done by the community-driven initiatives, or to detect if these initiatives missed out to cover some unserved areas, without conducting a more detailed and time consuming research.</span></li>\n\n<li><span>Missing public data.</span><span>\u00a0Several interesting pieces of information cannot be reliably determined from public records. For example, it would have been interesting to know the proportions of how many Nepali people and respectively foreigners founded, lead and contributed to initiatives, but this is only possible to find when interviewing initiatives, so hardly in a comprehensive way for all of them</span></li>\n\n<li><span>Fuzzy data.</span><span>\u00a0Boundaries between initiatives were fuzzy in several cases (e.g. coordinated multi-team initiatives like Yellow House), and the categorization was not able to capture this properly. The same problem applies to numerous activities: they were meant to present the core concerns of initiatives, but some initiatives did \u2018a bit of everything\u2019, making them hard to analyze.</span></li>\n\n<li><span>Requiring online information.</span><span>\u00a0Relying on analyzing first and secondary source online publications meant that the method could only find initiatives about which something was published online. Due to the ubiquity of Facebook as a coordination tool among initiatives, this includes virtually all initiatives operating from cities. Therefore, the method did not find independent relief operations at village level, which are </span><span>managed by local resources and manpower only and, without the privilege of online coverage, have high chances of going unnoticed. With this method, disaster response volunteers in villages were covered only insofar they collaborated with initiatives reaching out to them from the cities.</span></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<span>For a more complete picture of the significance of community-driven earthquake response, potential further research should answer </span><span>the following question</span><span>: How much did the different types of responders contribute to total relief and reconstruction work after the earthquake? This relates to self-help, neighborly help, community-driven disaster response at village level, community-driven disaster response at regional and national level, government and security forces, and disaster response by the international community of donors and response professionals (incl. UN system). This question cannot be answered by mapping using public information as in this study, but would require a field study in randomly chosen settlements, followed by statistical estimation.</span>\n\n<span>The second major limitation is that of quantitatively analyzing key facts about initiatives does not grant insights into their inner working models, processes and challenges. Follow-up research should employ qualitative methods like ethnography to acquire these insights.</span>\n\n<h2 class=\"c11\">\n\n<a id=\"h.jzicukuin7tr\" name=\"h.jzicukuin7tr\"></a><span>6.2. </span><span>Relevance for Professional Disaster Responders</span>\n\n</h2>\n\n<span>The findings relating to community driven response to the earthquake in Nepal can be a basis for professional disaster responders to facilitate broad based local preparedness for long-term emergency response and other local efforts. By devising frameworks and conducting trainings for information management, crisis </span><span>mapping, assessing local power structures, needs evaluation, conflict-resolution skills, supplies management methods, and community-profile development, these professional disaster responders would ultimately contribute by informing the citizens that their involvement is essential to local development well beyond times of disaster. This will in due course of time ultimately foster well-planned and effective reconstruction activities. Likewise, more similar grassroot mobilisation can be planned for, and responded to in the aftermath of the disaster. Furthermore, processes such as bringing together diverse local groups, formation of local groups for planning, establishing long term vision and goal setting for disaster preparedness / recovery and recruitment of experienced local citizens can to lead the reconstruction. They could further also contribute by establishing an alliance between local groups that have been affected from the same areas and set a stage for more effective resource and responsibility sharing during times of crisis. Such alliance can therefore serve as a liaison between local grassroot efforts and more formal structures. Professional disaster responders could ultimately fill in the gaps by rendering support in areas which were not covered by the voluntary institution primarily due to inadequate professional expertise. For instance by providing staff for medical emergencies and treatments. </span>\n\n<h2 class=\"c11\">\n\n<a id=\"h.2t98gxt1vipt\" name=\"h.2t98gxt1vipt\"></a><span>6.3. </span><span>Relevance for Disaster Response R&amp;D</span>\n\n</h2>\n\n<span>Disaster response is under increasing scrutiny to work efficiently, transparently and accountable. Thus, it is worth keeping an eye on recent developments in technology, social changes, and grassroots innovations.</span>\n\n<span>This study identifies and analyzes community-driven disaster response as one of the grassroots innovations that can help to improve current disaster response mechanisms. In its movement-scale form observed in Nepal, community-driven disaster response can be considered an application of Internet-enabled peer-to-peer communication, collaboration and funding mechanisms \u2013 a latest addition to recent disruptive innovations like collaborative</span><span>\u00a0economy platforms</span><span>, </span><span>knowledge sharing platforms</span><span>\u00a0and </span><span>digital collaboration platforms</span><span>.</span><sup><a href=\"#ftnt14\" id=\"ftnt_ref14\" name=\"ftnt_ref14\">[14]</a></sup><span>\u00a0Obviously, such a development was only possible after widespread Internet uptake, now a given in urban Nepal.</span>\n\n<span>Designing a tool that further empowers community-driven disaster response and enables efficient coordination and collaboration with professional disaster responders is a task beyond the scope of this project. Relevant research questions for further work include:</span>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><span>Have community-driven disaster response initiatives been truly </span><span>successful in matching needs to provided supplies and help?</span><span>\u00a0What factors influence their level of success in this?</span></li>\n\n<li><span>How can the spirit of voluntarism and generosity be sustained when dealing with other challenges in Nepal, not just during a few weeks of volunteer disaster response work?</span></li>\n\n<li><span>Can the new, spontaneously emerged community-driven initiatives transform into permanent and established actors in civil society? Is that desirable?</span></li>\n\n<li><span>In what ways can community-driven initiatives contribute to reconstruction?</span></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<span>For such future work, the database and analysis of initiatives provided here is a viable basis. Informed by it and extrapolating from current technological developments, here is an idea-stage list of possible design aspects of such a tool:</span>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><span>Preparing </span><span>appropriate knowledge tools.</span><span>\u00a0</span><span>A major challenge for community-driven disaster response is that they have to build up their knowledge base and coordination toolset while doing the relief work, which means, under severe time constraints and with incomplete information.. Professional disaster preparedness organizations may want to provide support for compiling knowledge into compact \u2018field manuals\u2019 beforehand, esp. including best practices for coordination that were observed among community-driven responses to past disasters.</span></li>\n\n<li><span>Humanitarian Data Information System (HDIS).</span><span>\u00a0The public Humanitarian Response platform</span><sup class=\"c26\"><a href=\"#ftnt15\" id=\"ftnt_ref15\" name=\"ftnt_ref15\">[15]</a></sup><span>\u00a0is a tool provided by UN OCHA to coordinate humanitarian response operations. It provides up-to-date situation reports, event notifications and key documents for download, and is complemented with the recently launched Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) platform.</span><sup class=\"c26\"><a href=\"#ftnt16\" id=\"ftnt_ref16\" name=\"ftnt_ref16\">[16]</a></sup><span>\u00a0HDX is a platform for visualizing and downloading datasets, based on the open source software application CKAN.</span><sup class=\"c26\"><a href=\"#ftnt17\" id=\"ftnt_ref17\" name=\"ftnt_ref17\">[17]</a></sup><span>\u00a0An information system is a natural extension of this setup. In contrast to downloadable reports, an information system is an online database that provides real-time authoritative information, preventing data redundancy, inconsistency and duplication. This makes it a useful coordination tool also for community-driven disaster response initiatives, which in contrast to professional disaster responders do not have their own internal coordination tools and mechanisms and currently rely on ad-hoc solutions.</span></li>\n\n<li><span>Phone-based coordination and assessment tool.</span><span>\u00a0Different from professional disaster responders, members of community-driven initiatives in Nepal mostly use the phone and unstructured Facebook forums for coordination. They have neither the training, Internet connectivity, patience or formal obligation to coordinate via structured data input into software applications. This limits their own efficiency, and excludes most coordination with professional disaster response organizations (esp. via the UN clusters). To accommodate the contributions of community-driven responses, a national single-number hotline could work. Information managers in a call center would both take and make phone calls to provide and collect information, and would be trained to relay all this to the information system discussed above.</span></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<hr class=\"c45\">\n\n<div>\n\n<a id=\"ftnt2\" name=\"ftnt1\">[1]</a><span>\u00a0We thankfully acknowledge funding of this research by UNDP Nepal, via contract UNDP/INST/012/2015.</span>\n\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\n<a name=\"ftnt2\">[2]</a><span>\u00a0Government of Nepal Disaster Risk Reduction Portal, </span><span><a class=\"c3\" href=\"http://www.drrportal.gov.np/\">http://www.drrportal.gov.np/</a></span><span>, accessed 31 May 2015.</span>\n\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\n<a id=\"ftnt3\" name=\"ftnt3\">[3]</a><span>\u00a0</span><span>Rajneesh Bhandari, Jonah M.

What were your motivations?</strong>\n\nThe Hubotics project started in late 2013. At that point I was about to finish my Master\u2019s studies and I wanted to add a practical side to my technical skills as an engineer and as a passionate DIYer by developing accessible technologies and aids which could have helped improving independence for people suffering from motor disabilities. Actually, the reason why I decided to study engineering and became a builder and hacker stemmed from my personal experience with my sister Chiara, who suffers from a motor disability.\n\nI remember, as a child, my parents used to buy plenty of super expensive devices, as computer headsets, mice, keyboards or having to travel back and forth between clinics and private medical studios to have access to the \u201clatest\u201d rehabilitation techniques. After having hacked wheelchairs, remote controls for doors and televisions inside our house and having realized several other robotic contraptions, I realized that achievement of independence through the use of one\u2019s own body is one of the most gratifying experiences everyone could hope for, that\u2019s how the idea of creating an exoskeleton to be used in everyday\u2019s life was born.\n\n<strong>2. Did you start alone? How long did it take to develop the initial prototype? How was it funded?</strong>\n\nAround that time, I started speaking about these ideas with Roberto, a friend with whom I had studied between Torino and Milano. Together, we started brainstorming and discussing and we finally converged on the idea of developing a low-cost, 3D printed exoskeleton for rehabilitation and assistance of upper-limbs, directly at people\u2019s homes.\n\nThe idea was proposed at the Telecom Italia WCAP accelerator in Catania that believed in the project and decided to fund us. This allowed us to buy the 3D printers and the components to build and iterate on our ideas and prototypes. The first reliable prototype of the device, finalized in one year, consisted of a wearable, smartphone-controlled, elbow exoskeleton.\n\nAfter showing the device at the MakerFaire 2015 in Rome and gathering plenty of positive feedback, we understood that the project had plenty of potential and decided to keep working on it.\n\n<strong>What is your current status now?</strong>\n\nToday, together with Roberto and Chiara, we keep on improving our devices and iterate on the designs in order to achieve a concept as usable and useful as possible while maximizing customizability and accessibility. Our latest device consists of an exoskeleton with 3 active degrees of freedom for controlling the shoulder abduction/adduction, shoulder flexion/extension and elbow flexion/extension of its wearer.\n\nThe device can be controlled by means of a smartphone app or by a program with predefined motions/tasks.\n\n<strong>5. How do you see it moving forward? What kind of help/expertise/data that is missing for moving to a next phase?</strong>\n\nOur main objective in the near future is running experiments with potential users of the exoskeleton and their relatives, in order to gather further feedback and improve our devices based on this.\n\n\u00a0Additionally, we are brainstorming on possible models that would allow the project to keep its philosophy of openness and accessibility while making it economically sustainable. For example, how to fund the project in order to promote further development? How to enable open/low-cost and customizable solutions capable of reaching end-users? How to ensure that these devices would work (and keep working) at users\u2019 houses (services?), all these are open questions that we will be working on for the next phase.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-01-06 09:27:53", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:02.803470", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 804, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 105.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 56598, "user_id": 4022, "topic_id": 9953, "post_number": 27, "raw": "@johncoate and @inge  - this thread is getting very off-topic.

I noticed the meetup are filled with so much more good energy, it's obvious we all need it.

There are so many benefits to it, both to the workers and the employer. You already mentioned the financial, environmental and social ones. There is so much more though, related to efficiency, wellbeing of employees. A lot of people lose at least 2hours, many 3 hours as well, for preparing to go to work and commuting to and from. That makes no sense really. Freeing those 2-3 hours per day for a person could mean a huge deal, increase the level of happiness for several reasons.\nThe isolation and depression can easily be dealt with. Have a scheduled 1 day per week or two weeks (not an obligation for all) social events. People will appreciate it a lot and those who do need to get out and socialise would come. You can even make it as part of one working day, some kind of team building event which would usually be during the office hours.\nWorking 10 hours per day is nonsense anyway. Only entrepreneurs get something done efficiently like that (because their skin is in the game) and even they lose A LOT in productivity after a very short period in such rhythm. \nI know I have days I simply shut down for anything work related, not on purpose really, just my being feels I am losing too much efficiency and i need a break.\nWhat's the point of having someone 10 hours in the office if the person does effectively 5h of work? Have the person in the office for 6h max on one day and spend 3 hours on a team building event or any social event.\nIf we create a result/reward orientated system, we can easily increase efficiency with lower working hours.\n\nI don't know about differences with Americans, working with 2 but they have been working online since before Covid already :slight_smile:. As you can imagine, their conversations are dominated with burning issues there atm and things like \"should we send our children to schools soon\". I have enjoyed working with all of them over the years but one. That one will not get any future offers and he lost a fulfillment deal literally in his pocket already :zipper_mouth_face:\n\nA lot of people do remote work in Balkans already, due to cheap labor. A lot of companies outsource all kinds of work for that reason. Like Serbia and Romania have a huge amount of game testers and developers, web site and app developers there.

I was staying in a hostel in an edgier part of town (at least at night), because of the many social services in the area. All sorts of people who visit those during the day, hang out there at night, sleeping on the streets, nowhere else to go. A grim view of the US, which didn\u2019t get better later.\n\nWalking through the city the next morning, there were tens of homeless people every block. With massive skyscrapers in the background, the effects of the incumbent system are apparent: it produces winners and losers. Or as John put it: freedom to succeed, freedom to fail.\n\nA bit later, in Boston, we got talking to two African American guys who ended up giving us a bunch of T-shirts. Mine sums up most of the talks on politics I had in the US. </br>\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/3dcf94225f6596430fcc3ceb94bba670f60bc8ad.jpg\" width=\"388\" height=\"690\">\n\n</br>\nAs a counterweight to the darkness, I got to hang out a lot in Oakland and Counter Culture Labs (CCL). CCL is located in the Omni Commons, a large community space that is an old Italian  social club. It has a large ballroom, boxing ring, basements and multiple big rooms hosting organisations. CCL is one of those organisations and the full list is here (https://omnicommons.org/index.html#about). With names like Food Not Bombs and Liberated Lens you can get a sense of the vibe. There was also the Bay Area Anarchist Book Fair while I was there, which attracted plenty of people for zines, workshops and books. </br>\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7f6357107882e10284aa791f349b4604edf5bbaa.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\">\n\n\n_Goodbye San Francisco, hello Oakland_\n</br>\nI had the pleasure to meet plenty of amazing people at CCL. All with more ideas than they have time to do, but loads of energy to have fun experimenting away with biology anyway. I helped out with some yeast lab work and attended several social & project meetups. One of the highlights was a workshop I hosted on mycelium materials together with Bay Area Applied Mycology (BAAM). It attracted 20+ people, all highly interested and motivated to get down to business with the technology. Due to limited resources, we had to hack some things together, which made it all the more interesting. First time I used a cheese grater for science.\n\nPer coincidence I ended up at the 10 year anniversary party of Noisebridge, the infamous hackerspace in San Francisco, where I finally learned how to lockpick (I\u2019m still pretty mediocre).\n\nWe discussed and planned for where to go with Open Insulin. The idea of a patient coop to steward the protocol (and the gains from it) gained traction, so we\u2019ll be looking into that during [Anthony\u2019s session](https://edgeryders.eu/t/organizing-the-open-science-behind-open-insulin/826). We continued the talks at the Global Community Bio Summit, the 4 day event I travelled to Boston for.\n</br>\n**The Bio Summit**\n\nThe event in Boston was a transformative experience. That was the reaction of most people, including myself, at the end of our time together at the MIT Media Lab. Even the seasoned biohackers, active for many years, had similar sentiments. The Summit brought together 150+ people from all over the world in an inspiring four days.\n\nI was there with two friends with whom I started the biohackerspace in Ghent. The program was packed with anything and everything across the spectrum of diverse initiatives in the biohacking scene. We visited one of the biggest synthetic biology companies in the world, as well as a local permaculture farm. We went to huge makerspaces, local community biolabs and had a great party. There were talks on feminism, VC funding, open source hardware and biodiversity. The people in attendance showed excellent qualities you\u2019d want from a community like that: talent, open mindedness and high energy to change things up.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1d63152f720aea4f52abf47c5ffbbd411020bfeb.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\">\n</br>\nSome loose thoughts and conclusions. We are doing well in Ghent. Our view on things is very multidimensional compared to other labs, who are mainly focussed on technology and trying to survive, without all that much worries on socio-economic and political aspects of choices. Not that the latter is required to be good at what you do.\n\nWe learned about community engagement. Many successful labs were inward looking communities, providing mainly for their members and the shared resources. In ReaGent we have looked outwards most of the time, trying to service the broader public. Seeing other communities at work was instructive and we\u2019ll be applying certain lessons to our own activities back in Belgium. We\u2019ll definitely put our own fun first more often, which was sometimes traded for servicing other people.\n\nEveryone is open to collaborate and share resources, but no one does it. Over the course of the event, the message did get through to most: we can share more globally to help each other with the hard stuff, like finances. Sharing workshop formats and devices are a direct benefit to many labs\u2019 bottom lines. It just takes asking each other, or contributing to a shared online resource.\n\nWe have a sophisticated financial model (or framework) as opposed to most spaces. We did not get the chance to share much in depth, since there was no time in the schedule. Most conversations on the topic were relatively superficial and in the unconference formats it is not so conducive of conversation to hog the speaking time. I see however the merit to synthesize some of our practices into something that is more easily accessible for other spaces.\n\nThat, or we overthink it.\n\nThe event was very diverse, props to the organizers for making sure. That way we got to meet people from every continent. Especially South-East Asia and South America were strongly represented. \n\nJoi Ito challenged us in the opening talk: are we a movement? After spending these days together, everyone was convinced: we are a diverse, global movement and poised to play an important role in the future of biotech.\n</br>\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/75a562513dbd17901a73b733d1091a5ea8ac10df.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"353\">\n</br>\nOn the final day, we held an unconference session on Open Insulin. Several people wanted to get involved with their own lab, a group in Ecuador and a group in Mexico. The San Francisco team offered to share resources as well as materials and info. From the past, it was clear that we need a better way to share though. We will try to have local/global facilitators to smoothen the collaboration. I will help out onboarding new groups, from our experiences joining half a year ago.\n\nWith more groups, more possible research directions can be pursued. We can also work together better on the same direction, by brainstorming together and distributing the execution of experiments.\n\nThere are several initiatives being taken to look more into economics, governance of the IP, policy etc. With a global distribution, different options can be explored and different opportunities can arise. I\u2019m looking forward to ride this learning curve more!\n\nIn these hectic weeks leading up to OpenVillage Festival, and our continuous efforts to stay afloat with projects locally, there is little time to process and report deeper on the rapid succession of experiences. I hope to share more live, as a participant at the Festival!\n</br>\n_This blogpost has been realised as part of the OpenCare Community Fellowship Program with the support of SCImPULSE Foundation._", "created_at": "2017-09-30 08:35:21.226064", "updated_at": "2018-11-22 21:28:03.897782", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1302, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 68.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20879, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 3945, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Ok here's what I heard</b>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\t<span>Why do we still need to go get jobs and work for the man?</span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span>Why is there so much reproduction of old structures and behaviours that hold us back and how do we change this?</span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span>If we \u2018re so smart, why are we unable to ensure every human has their needs fulfilled and can live without hunger, fear or despair? </span>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong><span>Things will not get better simply because we have the ability to revolt or tear down states, we have to build something better.</span></strong>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>So what infrastructures do we need for people to be ok, who is already doing relevant work and how can we support one another? \u00a0 </span>\n\n<span><span>During \\#31c3 we\u2019re running a food//drinks centred space to host conversations about mapping what people are doing, which parts of the puzzle of well being they are contributing to, what kinds of infrastructures are missing for us to support each others projects, and live great lives ...p2p?</span> \u00a0 <span>We found this visualisation of the different dimensions of well-being</span>: \u00a0 </span>\n\n<span><span><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://sharingthecity.cre8tives.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2012/10/spiral_indicators_coe.png\" style=\"width: 700px; height: 496px;\"></span> \u00a0</span>\n\n<span><span>Which part(s) of the puzzle are you hacking on or are interested in? </span><span>Show and tell what you are working on and connect with others at the Edgeryders community kitchen during \\#31C3.</span> After the event we follow up connecting people with complimentary projects, needs, missions and skillsets in Harmonious Hackathons. \u00a0</span>\n\n<span><strong>Question:</strong> How do we document this well in the space and online so it easily leads to harmonious hackathon organisation?

An _edge_ of sorts if you will. The space between vital propulsion and a witholding to behold.  I'll repeat that slowly...  \n\nThe\nspace        \nbetween \nvital \npropulsion \nand \na \nwitholding \nto \nbehold. \n\nThis is uncomfortable. This tension between human life force and the unfathomable slowness at which all life also evolves. The tension between the power we are given in life and the urgent grasping to survive. Much of my life practice is about tending to the discomfort that comes with our needing to control this space. In my opinion, mechanisms to control it have emerged in politics, religion, patriarchy, colonisation, technological determination, and so on. Biopolitics - of which Arendt could be called the mother and Foucault the father - at it's most simplest is about the mechanisms of power created to control life. \n\nAnd so I'm interested in biopolitical compositions - responsive, emergent, collective, creative and rhythmic forms that sustain life.\n\nFor a couple of years before I joined Edgeryders I was working with a research network that spans process philosophy, politics and relational art ([SenseLab](http://senselab.ca/wp2/)) and there one of the key things we explore is how to \"study\" together. In this way, one of my favourite and simplest things we ever did was a little conference technique of Brian Massumi, myself and others called \"bench talks,\" where attendees picked numbers out of a hat and then for one hour the next day went to a bench we had allocated a number in Montreal, and simply had a conversation, and then we all came together and shared what arose. Slow food of a kind I think.. \n\nAnyway, there are many more conversations emerging in my mind in relation to this (I participated in the Australian slow food movement back in 2012 for example, and typically only travel overland - spent 4 days on buses in a two week voyage just this last month in fact...); but alas I'm amidst a delicate practice of holding so very much work to do and      \n[text-direction=rtl]\n.... breathing.\n\n[/text-direction]\nIt's one of the things I'm most grateful for here at Edgeryders. That we're in the deep end - we throw ourselves there and we're among others who continue to throw us - and at the same time we're supported and witnessed in how to swim and breathe anew. I'm not interested in being stressed. And as someone that experiences daily anxiety, as someone that thinks in fast moving constellations and attracts people who think akin and connect across \"resonance boards\" of these complex systems that we thrive in .. well yes, slow is vital.

This way you can edit the contents of `./src/data/template.md` and see the changes in the browser. It will be a lot faster than editing a site on discourse. \n\nPlease put any new issues in this repository.\n\n> 2. Why does the following not produce a grey background?\n\n`rgba(255,255,255,0.3)` is actually **white** set to opacity 0.3 - if you want gray `rgba(0,0,0,0.3)` is what you're looking for.\n\n> Can we have an explanation of the  `template`  and  `theme`  parameter and a list of the accepted values? Example:\n`<Blog tag=\"sf-econ-blog\" template=\"standard\" items=\"4\" columns=\"2\" display=\"author, date\">`\n\nAs a brief explanation:\n\n1. **Template** - most of the time, this does not need to be changed (it always defaults to `edgeryders` if it is not defined). The template parameter is a way of changing the `.vue` file in which all the components are loaded, if we wish to do so in the future (it can be used for loading custom layouts and components such as https://er-freelance.netlify.app).\n2. **Theme** - this will load a `.css` file stored in `/public` directory. The CSS changes the 'look' of the site, but unlike the `template` it does not modify any of the components loaded.\n\n3. `<Blog tag=\"sf-econ-blog\" template=\"standard\" items=\"4\" columns=\"2\" display=\"author, date\">`\n\nThis means:\n* Load topics tagged `sf-econ-blog`\n* `template` defines the layout of the component, the only option is `default` for now.\n* `items=\"4\"` maximum number of items to show at once. I am adding a paginated option so this will let users navigate between older and newer posts\n* `columns=\"2\" ` set to the number of columns to display (1, for a single column of posts)\n* `display=\"author, date\"` - determines the metadata to show below the post title, for the moment limited to `author` and `date`, will also shortly include `comments` and `likes` \n\nThat's only for the `blog` component, there are other parameters for each component and there will be further details in the documentation by tomorrow.\n\nFor the look of the econscifi site - if you have any requirements, I can add them to the theme. \n\nI've kept it intentionally minimal, but if any changes need to be made it's probably worth discussing in a phone call or with a simple mockup.", "created_at": "2020-07-15 20:12:09.818906", "updated_at": "2020-07-15 20:26:28.662873", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 467, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 26.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [80472], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14837, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 673, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Can asthma treatment be open?</b>\n\nHello @Michel , thanks for this great story (and thanks for taking the time of writing in English, unfortunately most people in Edgeryders do not speak or read\u00a0Malagasy).

I've seen it written that Gandhi, King and others relied partly on the background assumptions of the culture they lived in, for their non-violent approach to succeed. I would perhaps contrast that with the idea of non-violent protest under the Nazi regime 1940-45. A recipe for instant disappearance and death, along with anyone else who showed any signs of supporting the non-violent protest.\n\nNon-violence as a way of life, however, I do believe is nearly always good. It's just that open protest might not be the way to go. Instead, it might be being kind to one's oppressors. Or treating them with empathy. Nonviolent Communication is a good set of principles in many settings. But people have to be human. What good is non-violence in face of a pack of hungry wolves or hyenas? And sometimes, people lose their humanity, behaving like animals. It can be very hard to call back people's humanity, but perhaps always worth the effort?\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-19 19:22:15", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:49.281205", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 186, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19701, "user_id": 330, "topic_id": 1600, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>*COMMUNIQU\u00c9 FINAL DU G20 YES 2012*</b>\n\n<a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EsgDwZkbMXY/T9hxwfO5FBI/AAAAAAAAVIw/U9y4_yaIp5w/s1600/g20yes+mexico+logo.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"text-decoration: none; color: rgb(34, 136, 187); margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; \"><img border=\"0\" height=\"128\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EsgDwZkbMXY/T9hxwfO5FBI/AAAAAAAAVIw/U9y4_yaIp5w/s320/g20yes+mexico+logo.png\" style=\"border-top-style: solid; border-right-style: solid; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: solid; border-width: initial; border-color: initial; position: relative; padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-left: 5px; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); border-top-width: 1px; border-right-width: 1px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 1px; border-top-color: rgb(238, 238, 238); border-right-color: rgb(238, 238, 238); border-bottom-color: rgb(238, 238, 238); border-left-color: rgb(238, 238, 238); -webkit-box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0976563) 1px 1px 5px; box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0976563) 1px 1px 5px; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; \" width=\"320\"></a>\n\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\" itemprop=\"name\" style=\"margin-top: 0.75em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; position: relative; font: italic normal normal 22px/normal Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; \">*Communiqu\u00e9 Final du G20 YES 2012 \u00abL'Entrepreneuriat des jeunes pour l'emploi et la croissance\u00bb...*</h3><b>La 4\u00e8me \u00e9dition du G20 des Entrepreneurs vient de s\u2019achever \u00e0 Mexico et a \u00e9t\u00e9 particuli\u00e8rement appr\u00e9ci\u00e9e par les 400 entrepreneurs des pays du G20 tant par la hauteur de vue de ses intervenants que par la qualit\u00e9 de ses travaux et de ses conclusions qui vont \u00eatre transmises au B20 et au G20 dans les prochains jours...</b>\n\n<b>*Communiqu\u00e9 Officiel, les propositions concr\u00e8tes des 400 entrepreneurs r\u00e9unis \u00e0 cette occasion (en/fr).</b>\n\n*<a href=\"http://www.journees-entrepreneur.com/g20-yes-2012/les-travaux-ernst-a-young-et-mc-kinsey.html\" style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 4px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; text-decoration: none; color: rgb(34, 136, 187); border-collapse: collapse; font-weight: bold; line-height: 15px; \">Les Rapports</a><b>...

We try to have education linked to life and not separate from it. We treat children as adults so that the process of education is effective, reciprocal and enjoyable for all. We respect the difference of children and understand its importance to life. We try, if possible, to interact with our surroundings and cling to our reality as \u201cthe school\u201d is basically  a center for scientific research whose applications should be related to solving the problems of society. We try to expose the child to the greatest experience of life and the greatest amount of arts, sciences, crafts and various skills. We look for what we can together add to the world. We try to make the most of everything around us. Sources of knowledge are not exclusive to anyone. Everyone in the community, parents and kids, have something to benefit and teach the others. We try to get out all the positive energies in society. We try to make children independent and free by having multiple tools and skills. We try to prove to the Egyptians that the problem was never in the bad luck, but it was in the lack of skills.\u201d_\n\nSince 3 years, [I have been homeschooling my children.](https://edgeryders.eu/t/a-homeschooling-story-from-egypt/6657/16) Now I founded, with Atef also and a small team, seven crafts; a space for knowledge and experience exchange and for learning by doing.\n\nAfter a while from my experience with homeschooling using American curriculum, I found out that my children are learning the same curriculum that gets them in the system from preparatory school to highschool to university, just the normal educational path and most probably in the end the life that they will experience after that will be much different than the life now. I am trying to make them experience and see and choose for themselves how they want to move forward in their life.\n\nLife is changing, that\u2019s normal in the current economical transformation as the economy moves to be based more on knowledge in the post-industrial era. For example; jobs in the agricultural sector in the american market dropped from 40% at the beginning of the 20th century to only 2% by the end of it, same in the industrial sector which dropped from 30% in the forties to 10% by the end of the century. Currently there are a lot of jobs that could disappear and get replaced by robots; lawyers-doctors-data analytics-stock exchange agents-....., as robots are more efficient in data analysis, so at least a lot of jobs will be reduced ( could reach to 2 humans -8 robots in some fields ) \n\nSo the educational system is already changing, event it is being reconsidered internationally, and we have the priority or urgency  to do so as we don\u2019t have a \u201cfunctional\u201d education system in egypt. That \u2018s why we needed a community space to learn together and try to solve our  problems. ( Currently, under the current situations  the country, we can\u2019t make big public survey or bigger public interaction with the wider community of our neighbourhood, but we are preparing the steps to do with our smaller community ) \n\nNow my older son ( 16 years old) is the graphic designer for \u201cseven crafts\u201d he works with us with a salary, and also does sometimes  freelance jobs via the internet. He tried to learn development but didn\u2019t like it and found himself afterwards in graphic design, he taught himslef and now he is working. \nMy other smaller son ( 11 years ) found himself more in the handcrafts, in origami and leather work, now he gives a workshop \u201chow to make a natural leather wallet\u201d  for kids ( from 6-12 ) at \u201cseven crafts\u201d he prepares the workshop and buys the leather by himself. \n\nLearning in \u201cSeven crafts\u201d is based on experience; that\u2019s why we host experienced people from different fields to share their knowledge with us. We let the children pass by different experiences in order to learn. For example, we make trips to the egyptian museum with an archeologist who tells them the stories of the artifacts, how it was build, and how it was discovered, and this way they learn the history in a totally different way than the school books. We offer workshops in various fields such as: astronomy, agriculture, photography, woodworking, theatre, recycling, first aid, scientific themes like \u201chow does the plane fly?\u201d . Some are kind of introduction or quick crash course for the topic, others are more of an intensive learning track or course that gives the kids a craft to work with like software development or graphic design.  \n\n Learning through this kind of experiences is very different and beneficial, I myself became an engineer because in school I didn\u2019t like humanities or geography, from the way it was taught I had to memorize a lot of information that I don\u2019t want to know, and was more into mathematics and physics,, I only knew the value of humanities when I grew up and experienced life and started reading for people like Gamal Hemdan ( and his book the character of Egypt) , and realize that\u2019s interesting, wait that\u2019s geography \u2026..but it is very different than the way I was taught it should be in school. \n\nOne of the benefits of Seven crafts is that the people learn together, there is no discrimination based on age. Children are treated like responsible adults, even in some workshops like the wood working or the leather works some university students attend them among  other participants. Even we are being approached by University students and graduates who want to learn real education and useful skills to join find better jobs. \nWe offer other activities at our space, We host meetings for groups who are learning via MOOCs, we make movie viewings with discussions. We may in the near future initiate or host some interest-based clubs, for astronomy or physics or so.. In general we are open to exchange experiences with other people who are experimenting in the same filed in any place in the world and to learn from each other. \n\nCurrently, we are operating from one place in Zahara\u2019 El-Ma\u2019ady , Cairo but due to the fact that there are not so many places that offer what we are offering, people come to us from different and relatively far neighborhoods in Cairo. I hope that in the near future every neighborhood will have its own self-learning center. It is not expensive to find people who want to share their skills, everyone in the community can offer what he does best, for example a full time photographer comes and gives workshops on photography, My brother gave a workshop on project management, I gave a workshop on \u201cprobabilities\u201d  , Atef always makes his amusing workshop about \u201chow does the plane fly?\u201d.\n\nOur workshops are increasing and there is need for them, everyone consists of 8 to 10 people and we offer \u201cscholarships\u201d for the ones who can\u2019t pay. Mainly \u00bc attend the workshop with scholarships paid by people from our community who believe in the idea. \n\nOf course we are facing a financial sustainability challenge, Now we are at the school summer break and there are a lot of people attending our activities, the number might decrease in winter as the people get busy with the schools timewise and financially wise as school fees became a big financial burden. Some parents believe that what their kids learn in seven crafts is much more important than the school but they have to pay the school fees every year for their kids as the school and university will not only provide their kids with a certificate but it will save their kids from serving 3 years in the army. So we are moving  against the stream but we are surrounded by people who believe in what we are doing.

It's more about how we perceive the space, generally speaking. But there are a lot of studies about cross-cultural cognition/perception/experience of place/space in which researchers analyse some cultural references connected to place. In the case you linked, for example, the Syrian costume to live, gather and meet in public space collides to the German one - or maybe it's more a matter of incertitude towards a new country legislation, that can be seen stressful, especially if you are a refugee - and the interdiction to actively and socially perform the public space could affect the cognition of a new space. So I would look at it in that perspective. \nBut still food is a sensuos experience and it relates to instinct and memories: as Proust perfectly described it with the \"madeleine episode\", food can instantly bring you in different time and place and it is associated with emotions. So maybe food can be used as a tool through which having an embodied experience of a place. \nWell, I'm just brainstorming right now. \n\nAnd thank you also for the second story: I've been moving a lot in my life, even if mainly in Italy, so starting again is something I'm used to and that I enjoy.

The report gives prominence to the consequences of technical innovation on inequalities and justice.\n\nGlobally, increasing inequalities have generated widespread injustice. Fear, resentment, and anger have escalated among the more vulnerable sections of society, giving rise to an authoritarian dynamic. We propose that this state of affairs is not inevitable; it is, rather, the result of a U-turn in policy and culture that has taken place over the last 30 years.\n\nThis evening event convenes policy makers and academics and technologists to look in more depth at the issue of how equality and justice are encoded in technological choices.\n\nWe are going to look at the main technologies being developed in the Next Generation Internet debate and explore how AI and Internet Infrastructure impact on indicators of equality and justice. Putting in the same room technologists, economists and social scientists should allow for a more holistic perspective.\n\nHopefully, we can provide some material to the European Parliament and European Commision that will shape the governance of and investment in a Next Generation Internet that sets the conditions for improved social justice and equality.\n\n## Format\nTo ensure a deep, technical, discussion we depart from a set of case studies.  \n\n**Ahead of the event:** we collectively do research and collect stories of well-documented incidents where certain injustices manifested. We post them here on the platform and invite people to post questions/reflections in comments to help us develop them into good case studies.  \n\n**During the event:**  We split the participants into different groups based on the case study of interest to them. Each group is well composed in terms of the areas of expertise of participants needed to have a deep, rich and pragmatic discussion around \"their\" case study. And look at the interdependencies in terms of policy, business models, behaviours and technological choices. The session ends with a [fishbowl discussion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishbowl_(conversation)). \n\n**After the event:** The documentation from the discussions are redacted to ensure privacy of participants, then posted on the online discussion space for the festival.  This enables us to do a number of things -\n\n* easily reconnect with people we met across shared/complimentary interests \n* build a high quality report summarising what knowledge has emerged from the discussions\n* keep everyone informed about new, relevant, opportunities for professional and personal development, follow up events etc\n\nWe can also accommodate remote participation, there is a separate process for this.

We want to ensure that every participant leaves the venue having presented and discussed their work with others who can provide meaningful input or connect them with opportunities to further their professional and or personal development.  If this appeals to you, then we would love to have you join us._  \n\n\n### How is this event being organised?\nThis event, and the festival it is part of, is  coordinated on the edgeryders platform (where you are now) and co-curated through a series of community video calls. We have allocated a collaboratively managed budget for the festival and operate on a solidarity basis. Participants who need some financial support to organise or be able to participate in the festival are eligible provided they contribute towards making it a meaningful and generative experience for all - in the run up to, during and/or after the event. If you would like to join us but are unsure as to how to contribute, don't worry. Create an [edgeryders account](https://communities.edgeryders.eu/login), then [tell us a bit about yourself here](https://edgeryders.eu/c/ioh/tell-us-about-you) and we will guide you along from there.\n\nI (@nadia) am coordinating this event, with  @rmdes (venue and communication support), and @J_Noga (Moderation and session preparation) and @inge (documentation coordination)  Some people have been specially invited as guests because the work they are doing right now and their expertise will help ensure that the discussion is based on case studies, credible data and hands on experience. \n\n\n### How is this all financed?\nThis event is part of the NGI Forward project Generation Internet (NGI) initiative, launched by the European Commission in the autumn of 2016. It has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 825652 from 2019-2021. You can learn more about the initiative and our involvement in it at https://ngi.edgeryders.eu\n<br>\n\n![Ngi logo](https://ngi.edgeryders.eu/assets/images/ngi-logo.png)\n\n![Eu emblem](https://ngi.edgeryders.eu/assets/images/eu-emblem.png)\n\n###  Does getting involved mean I endorse the funders views or actions?\nNo. What you are doing is contributing to an open consultation on the topic of how to build a next generation of internet infrastructure, technologies, business models etc that promotes the wellbeing of humans and the natural environment. The consultation methodology is designed in such a way as to allow for diversity of views, premises, disciplines, themes and contexts. We employ open notebook science principles and the results will be presented in the form of a research report accessible to everyone after the event.

If it is true that people benefit from feedback, getting feedback from the ER community would also have been useful. 4 weeks is more than enough to do that. Also, there is no extra cost, because students need anyway to write what they want to do, why etc. But that is your call, really. You are welcome to run your engagement process as you see fit, and if you cannot make it work with ER, use something else. Costantino and I agreed this in Stockholm.

Both Di and me feel we have made a not-so-good choice when opting for an undergrad programme in our fields - mine Communication &amp; PR, hers Law school. She was courageous enough to take this year off and volunteer in Serbia, and although still is insecure about her future, this experience is very likely to pay off.\n\nAndrea says that \u00a0<em>a crisis like this about a professional path, is particulary valuable when you are young, because you are plent of time to restart, even from scratch.\n\nTry and fail is the only possibilty we have to find our path. It is normal and it is absolutely right to fail. It is our society that is telling us that failing is for losers, but in fact it is just the way has to be. Failing without changing, that is for losers!\u00a0</em>\n\nNot only is he encouraging her, but also recommends at least <strong>3 resources</strong> as guidance : <strong>a book</strong> (From Good To Great\" by Jim Collins), \u00a0<strong>self-interogation</strong> as means to succeed:\n\n<em>1) What are you deeply passionate about?\n\n2) What are you are genetically encoded for \u2014 what activities do you feel just \"made to do\"?\n\n3) What makes economic sense \u2014 what can you make a living at?\n\nThe intersection of the three answers/circles could be your lens to check if your decisions are coherent (and so they are probably creating a better value, a bigger possibility to success).</em>\n\nand finally taking up <strong>a mentor</strong>.. I like this idea very much, never thought of it in an active way. Sometimes when we are in school we are encouraged to think of role models. But <strong>role models and mentors are not the same thing</strong>. While role models are just there, passive and most of the time untouchable, mentors can have a much more active role in our development. I like this idea very much and I begin to think fondly of our edgemappers as some sort of mentors.. If anybody here wants to talk about the meaning of mentorship I would gladly take part in such a discussion.\n\nThank you Andrea very much, both for your story and for your thoughtful comment on Di's.

Thanks for the reminder. I sometimes take that so for granted because I'm in too deep to notice that not everybody spends their days pondering these questions :slight_smile:\n\nSome of the foundational questions to ask yourself is:\n- Should this mark provide a base-line, or be more aspirational? (One establishes a minimum standard, the other a \"gold\" standard, which means one applies to potentially everything while the other applies to a small subset.) \n- Do we build this around information provided by the vendor/manufacturer or do we verify information independently? (One is easy but could be abused, the other is more robust but more costly.)\n\nMy research on this might be outdated, but to the best of my knowledge, there isn't currently a canonical \"green\" trustmark for things like electronics. It seems like Fairphone's approach of making their phones' components transparent is about the limit of what has been possible. Why? The sourcing is *incredibly* complex. \n\nOnce you get to your definition of green/sustainability (Focus on materials? Sourcing processes? Repairability/recyclability? Shipping and packaging? Energy use? Something else entirely?) you'd likely need to start breaking down the product into its components, and possibly these components into their own more basic components. The way supply chains work, a product (let's take a smart home assistant as an example) might have software from a company that we would recognize, and some parts or most parts of the industrial design might come from the same company if it's a higher-end consumer brand. _Maybe_ the case and some chips and boards could be traced back, or reported on by the company (if they agree to share, because of IP rights). Once you're down to the chip level, most likely those were sourced as is in Shenzhen, and at the latest that stage is where documentation is likely to become a lot less complete (currently; that might change if there's a business case for better documentation!).\n\nSo! I believe there are some data bases for finding out environmental impact both on the materials side ([Dr. Isabel Ordonez mentioned something along those lines at a recent ThingsCon Salon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUs7XwvhIv4)) as well as on the energy side of digital products (The Green Web Foundation and Chris Adams to the rescue!).\n\nBeyond that, **I think this breaks reasonably new ground to really justify some deep research: How can we mitigate the lack of transparency and still get to meaningful insights into how green a product is? What are best practices to make things more green? What are strategies to allow for this type of mark to evolve as things get more transparent over time?**", "created_at": "2019-06-20 10:11:49.894336", "updated_at": "2019-06-20 10:11:49.894336", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 455, "wiki": false, "reads": 29, "score": 65.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [55476], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 58538, "user_id": 5311, "topic_id": 10638, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Wychowa\u0142am si\u0119 we wsi niedaleko miejscowo\u015bci, w kt\u00f3rej mieszkam.

Do \u015blubu w 1983 r. mieszka\u0142am z rodzicami, potem we wsi obok, a p\u00f3\u017aniej w ma\u0142ej miejscowo\u015bci, w  kt\u00f3rej mieszkam do dzi\u015b. Razem z m\u0119\u017cem otworzyli\u015bmy sklep w 1991 r. Prowadzili\u015bmy go przez oko\u0142o trzy lata. Przesta\u0142 by\u0107 op\u0142acalny. Otworzyli\u015bmy go, bo po 1989 r. by\u0142 boom na dzia\u0142alno\u015b\u0107 gospodarcz\u0105. Wszyscy otwierali. Jak si\u0119 nie mia\u0142o w\u0142asnego lokum \u2013 tak jak do tej pory - to dzia\u0142alno\u015b\u0107 nie ma sensu. Czynsz by\u0142 wysoki, brak klient\u00f3w, nie mo\u017cna by\u0142o mie\u0107 alkoholu, bo blisko szko\u0142a. By\u0142am na urlopie wychowawczym i pracowa\u0142am jednocze\u015bnie w sklepie. Potem przyj\u0119\u0142am si\u0119 jako pracownik obs\u0142ugi gospodarczej w policji. Chcia\u0142am wr\u00f3ci\u0107 do zawodu nauczyciela, ale nie mog\u0142am, bo trzeba by\u0142o sko\u0144czy\u0107 studia, a mia\u0142am troje dzieci.

M\u0105\u017c pracowa\u0142 jako policjant i mieli\u015bmy \u015brednie dochody z tego tytu\u0142u. Wystarcza\u0142o nam od pierwszego do pierwszego. Sytuacja finansowa pogorszy\u0142a si\u0119 nam, kiedy dzieci zacz\u0119\u0142y studiowa\u0107. M\u0105\u017c przeszed\u0142 na emerytur\u0119 w 1997 r. Mia\u0142 wtedy 449 z\u0142 emerytury,  a normalnie wtedy emerytury by\u0142y na poziomie: 130, 150, 180 z\u0142. Jego emerytura by\u0142a do\u015b\u0107 wysoka. Pracowa\u0142 te\u017c dorywczo na budowie, aby zasili\u0107 bud\u017cet.\n\nNie kwalifikowali\u015bmy si\u0119 do tego, aby otrzymywa\u0107 zasi\u0142ki z pomocy spo\u0142ecznej. Raz czy dwa zdarzy\u0142o si\u0119, \u017ce aby otrzyma\u0107 stypendium szkolne musia\u0142am odwo\u0142ywa\u0107 si\u0119 do SKO (przypom.: Samorz\u0105dowe Kolegium Odwo\u0142awcze), gdy\u017c nie chciano wyp\u0142aci\u0107 mi nale\u017cnego stypendium. Poniewa\u017c by\u0142a to w moim odczuciu decyzja krzywdz\u0105ca, zdecydowa\u0142am si\u0119 o nie zawalczy\u0107 z burmistrzem. Sta\u0142o si\u0119 tak, dlatego \u017ce do mojego dochodu doliczono dwukrotnie alimenty. M\u0105\u017c p\u0142aci\u0142 alimenty na dzieci od 1995/1996 r. po milionie na dziecko. Tak by\u0142o przed denominacj\u0105 w 1994 r., a po tym okresie by\u0142a to kwota 100 z\u0142 na jedno dziecko. Poda\u0142am go o alimenty, dlatego \u017ce z pobor\u00f3w mia\u0142 zabierane pieni\u0105dze na sp\u0142at\u0119 po\u017cyczek, a alimenty zabezpieczy\u0142y nam pieni\u0105dze na \u017cycie. Alimenty zatrzymywa\u0142y sp\u0142at\u0119 po\u017cyczek. W pierwszej kolejno\u015bci pobiera si\u0119 alimenty, a na reszt\u0119 mo\u017cna zabra\u0107 do pewnej wysoko\u015bci. Na \u017cycie musia\u0142o mu zosta\u0107 40% uposa\u017cenia. Mieszkali\u015bmy razem bez separacji. Ostatecznie si\u0119 nie rozwiedli\u015bmy, bo uwa\u017ca\u0142am, \u017ce dzieci musz\u0105 mie\u0107 ojca. Tym bardziej, \u017ce najstarszym dzieckiem by\u0142 ch\u0142opiec, kt\u00f3ry potrzebowa\u0142 autorytetu. Tak\u017ce c\u00f3rka, szczeg\u00f3lnie ta starsza, by\u0142a bardzo mocno emocjonalnie zwi\u0105zana z tat\u0105. Nie bra\u0142am pod uwag\u0119 rozwodu, tylko wyrzucenie m\u0119\u017ca z domu. M\u0105\u017c mia\u0142 bardzo intensywny romans. W tym czasie przychodzi\u0142 do domu na noc spa\u0107 albo nie przychodzi\u0142 w og\u00f3le. Nie dok\u0142ada\u0142 si\u0119 do \u017cycia, tzn. op\u0142aty rachunk\u00f3w, zakup\u00f3w \u017cywno\u015bci, ubra\u0144 dla dzieci itp. W domu prawie go nie by\u0142o. P\u0142aci\u0142 tylko alimenty. Tak to wygl\u0105da\u0142o z mojej perspektywy. By\u0142o bardzo ci\u0119\u017cko, ale wiedzia\u0142am, \u017ce dzieci musz\u0105 uko\u0144czy\u0107 studia, bo to jest ich kapita\u0142 na przysz\u0142o\u015b\u0107. Skromno\u015b\u0107 i m\u0105dra g\u0142owa to dobry start w przysz\u0142o\u015b\u0107, je\u015bli nie mo\u017cna liczy\u0107 na wsparcie finansowe z domu. W 1997 r.  zachorowa\u0142 m\u00f3j te\u015b\u0107  i sytuacja si\u0119 zmieni\u0142a. M\u0105\u017c intensywnie zacz\u0105\u0142 je\u017adzi\u0107 do szpitali, aby kontynuowa\u0107 cykl leczenia. Bo by\u0142a to choroba nowotworowa (rak czerniak). I wtedy sta\u0142o si\u0119 tak, \u017ce ostatni\u0105 wol\u0105 te\u015bcia by\u0142o to, \u017ceby m\u0105\u017c rzuci\u0142 tamto \u017cycie i wr\u00f3ci\u0142 do nas. Do\u015b\u0107 d\u0142ugo to trwa\u0142o (oko\u0142o 1,5 roku) pr\u00f3bowali\u015bmy wr\u00f3ci\u0107 do normalnego \u017cycia. Nie by\u0142o to wcale takie \u0142atwe, bo czas burzliwego \u017cycia mojego m\u0119\u017ca trwa\u0142 ok. 8 lat. Du\u017co si\u0119 przez ten okres zmieni\u0142o, my sami bardzo zmienili\u015bmy si\u0119. Mog\u0119 powiedzie\u0107 o sobie, \u017ce sta\u0142am si\u0119 inn\u0105 osob\u0105: odwa\u017cn\u0105, polegaj\u0105c\u0105 bardziej na sobie, konsekwentn\u0105, nieust\u0119pliw\u0105 w sprawach wa\u017cnych (chodzi o decyzje dot. dzieci) w my\u015bl powiedzenia ,,co ci\u0119 nie zabije, to ci\u0119 wzmocni\u201d.\n\nDo pe\u0142noletnio\u015bci trojga dzieci, dostawa\u0142am na nie alimenty. W 2004 r. urodzi\u0142am czwarte dziecko \u2013 syna i nie by\u0142o ju\u017c aliment\u00f3w, gdy\u017c sytuacja by\u0142a w miar\u0119 stabilna. Ma\u0142o tych pieni\u0119dzy by\u0142o w domu. Nie wystarcza\u0142o ju\u017c od pierwszego do pierwszego. Bra\u0142am kredyty, po\u017cycza\u0142am. Jak m\u0105\u017c zacz\u0105\u0142 pracowa\u0107 na budowach, to te pieni\u0105dze przeznaczali\u015bmy na edukacj\u0119 dzieci. Jednak to te\u017c nie wystarcza\u0142o, bo m\u0105\u017c mia\u0142 dwa na\u0142ogi: du\u017co pi\u0142 i pali\u0142 papierosy. Na te cele przeznacza\u0142 do\u015b\u0107 du\u017ce \u015brodki finansowe. Ale przeciwno\u015bci s\u0105 po to, \u017ceby je pokonywa\u0107. To sta\u0142o si\u0119 moj\u0105 dewiz\u0105 \u017cyciow\u0105.\n\nNajstarsze dziecko wyprowadzi\u0142o si\u0119 z domu przed 2010 r. Dwoje dzieci uczy\u0142o si\u0119 jednocze\u015bnie w innym mie\u015bcie. Jedno z nich wzi\u0119\u0142o kredyt studencki i to troch\u0119 poprawi\u0142o sytuacj\u0119 finansow\u0105. Ale ca\u0142y czas by\u0142y kredyty w bankach. Jeden sp\u0142aca\u0142am, bra\u0142am nast\u0119pny. Mogli\u015bmy te\u017c odpisa\u0107 100 z\u0142 darowizny na dojazdy dzieci do szko\u0142y w rozliczeniu podatkowym. Nie dostawa\u0142am tych pieni\u0119dzy do r\u0119ki, ale jako ulg\u0119 podatkow\u0105. W roku to by\u0142o 1 200 z\u0142. W mi\u0119dzyczasie syn podj\u0105\u0142 prac\u0119 jako ratownik medyczny, za\u0142o\u017cy\u0142 rodzin\u0119, a starsza c\u00f3rka prac\u0119 w organizacjach pozarz\u0105dowych. M\u0142odsza corka ko\u0144czy\u0142a w tym czasie studia pedagogiczne.\n\nW 2013 r. m\u0105\u017c zacz\u0105\u0142 chorowa\u0107 i w 2014 r. zdiagnozowano u niego chorob\u0119 nowotworow\u0105. I w tym momencie ca\u0142\u0105 rodzin\u0105 rozpocz\u0119li\u015bmy batali\u0119 o jego zdrowie. Dzi\u0119ki mojej zapobiegliwo\u015bci, nieocenionym posuni\u0119ciem by\u0142o ubezpieczenie m\u0119\u017ca w mojej polisie grupowej. Dzi\u0119ki temu wyp\u0142acali nam r\u00f3\u017cne kwoty z ubezpieczenia za: ci\u0119\u017ckie zachorowanie, utrat\u0119 mowy, zabieg operacyjny, pobyty w szpitalu. Koszty leczenia  pokrywane by\u0142y pieni\u0119dzmi wyp\u0142acanymi z ubezpieczenia. A by\u0142y to bardzo du\u017ce kwoty np.: przez miesi\u0105c m\u0105\u017c dostawa\u0142 bardzo drogie p\u0142ukanki \u2013 jedna kosztowa\u0142a  370 z\u0142 i  wystarcza\u0142a na dwa dni. Koszt p\u0142ukanek to oko\u0142o 8 000 z\u0142. Dlatego nie wpadali\u015bmy w wi\u0119ksze d\u0142ugi z tytu\u0142u leczenia. Rodzina te\u017c bardzo pomaga\u0142a, zamawiaj\u0105c opatrunki po cenach hurtowych, i moja przyjaci\u00f3\u0142ka, bo pracowa\u0142y w s\u0142u\u017cbie zdrowia. Opiekowa\u0142y\u015bmy si\u0119 m\u0119\u017cem w trakcie choroby na zmian\u0119 z m\u0142odsz\u0105 c\u00f3rk\u0105, kt\u00f3ra wtedy studiowa\u0142a zaocznie. To by\u0142o: gotowanie, zmiany opatrunk\u00f3w, codzienne wyjazdy na rehabilitacj\u0119 \u2013 50 km od domu, na wizyty lekarskie co kilka dni. Zmienili\u015bmy samoch\u00f3d na mniejszy, \u017ceby c\u00f3rce by\u0142o wygodniej prowadzi\u0107, gdy\u017c by\u0142a pocz\u0105tkuj\u0105cym kierowc\u0105. Po zako\u0144czeniu na\u015bwietla\u0144 chcieli\u015bmy z PFRONu (przyp.: Pa\u0144stwowy Fundusz Rehabilitacji Os\u00f3b Niepe\u0142nosprawnych) pozyska\u0107 \u015brodki na zakup syntezatora mowy, ale odm\u00f3wili z braku funduszy. \n\nPierwsza operacja m\u0119\u017ca by\u0142a skomplikowana, ca\u0142odniowa. Wtedy nie by\u0142o problem\u00f3w z po\u0142o\u017ceniem do szpitala, ale oczywi\u015bcie by\u0142y kolejki. Wtedy opieka by\u0142a taka jak powinna \u2013 niewymuszona przeze mnie. Od problem\u00f3w m\u0119\u017ca ze zdrowiem do postawienia diagnozy up\u0142yn\u0119\u0142o p\u00f3\u0142 roku.To prawie wyrok \u015bmierci. Najpierw dali mu antybiotyk, potem mia\u0142 skierowanie do laryngologa. Ten \u017ale go zdiagnozowa\u0142. Lekarz, uzna\u0142, \u017ce najpierw trzeba wyleczy\u0107 z\u0119by. Da\u0142 mu p\u0142ukanki. Przez miesi\u0105c nie pomaga\u0142o. Wzi\u0119\u0142am drugie skierowanie od lekarza POZ- u (przyp.: podstawowa opoieka zdrowotna), mimo, \u017ce m\u0105\u017c nie chcia\u0142. Trafili\u015bmy do regionalnego szpitala i tam na lekarza, kt\u00f3ry postawi\u0142 w\u0142a\u015bciw\u0105 diagnoz\u0119. Tego samego dnia zrobili biopsj\u0119. Lekarz zdenerwowa\u0142 si\u0119, widz\u0105c spos\u00f3b dotychczasowego leczenia. Po trzech tygodniach okaza\u0142o si\u0119, \u017ce to rak. Czekali\u015bmy w kolejce miesi\u0105c do operacji. Nie da\u0142o si\u0119 tego przy\u015bpieszy\u0107. Potem potrzebna by\u0142a druga operacja. Zapisali\u015bmy si\u0119 na na\u015bwietlenia. Przez przeoczenie lekarki \u2013 nie przekazali z innego szpitala papier\u00f3w - wyd\u0142u\u017cy\u0142o si\u0119 czekanie na na\u015bwietlenie. Troch\u0119 to przy\u015bpieszy\u0142am, robi\u0105c awantur\u0119. Na\u015bwietlanie  trwa\u0142o  1,5 miesi\u0105ca. Potem pojawi\u0142y si\u0119 problemy z r\u0119k\u0105. Nikt nie wiedzia\u0142 sk\u0105d te b\u00f3le. Twierdzili, \u017ce nerwy zanika\u0142y. Jeden profesor ortopedii powiedzia\u0142, \u017ce to nie s\u0105 przerzuty. Wymusza\u0142am w szpitalu szczeg\u00f3\u0142owe badania na obecno\u015b\u0107 kom\u00f3rek rakotw\u00f3rczych. Po zrobieniu rezonansu, nie zrobili opisu,  przez co czekali\u015bmy 3 miesi\u0105ce. Te\u017c tam burz\u0119 robi\u0142am. Potem zrobili opis, do niczego si\u0119 nie przyda\u0142, by\u0142 zrobiony \u017ale i lekarz go po prostu wyrzuci\u0142. Potem trafili\u015bmy do poradni leczenia b\u00f3lu. Okaza\u0142o si\u0119 \u017ce jest wznowa, czyli odnowi\u0142a si\u0119 choroba. Nie by\u0142o sposobu na pozbycie si\u0119 kom\u00f3rek rakowych. Potem jeszcze jeden lekarz wpad\u0142 na to, \u017ceby robi\u0107 na\u015bwietlenia od \u015brodka, czyli brachyterapi\u0119. Nie by\u0142o ju\u017c innego sposobu. Upar\u0142am si\u0119, \u017ceby\u015bmy jeszcze skonsultowali z jednym onkologiem. Chcia\u0142am m\u0119\u017cowi poda\u0107 chemi\u0119 paliatywn\u0105, kt\u00f3ra ani nie pomo\u017ce ani nie zaszkodzi, \u017ceby mia\u0142 wra\u017cenie, \u017ce jest leczony. Bo dop\u00f3ki by\u0142 leczony, wierzy\u0142, \u017ce wyzdrowieje. Wtedy przysz\u0142a lekarka i powiedzia\u0142a, \u017ce po co to temu pacjentowi chemia, skoro on ju\u017c umiera. To by\u0142o najgorsze zdanie, jakie us\u0142ysza\u0142am w ca\u0142ym procesie leczenia. Przekona\u0142am si\u0119 wtedy, \u017ce niekt\u00f3rzy lekarze nie maj\u0105 elementarnej wra\u017cliwo\u015bci ani empatii. Przez 1,5 miesi\u0105ca m\u0105\u017c le\u017ca\u0142 jeszcze w szpitalu, ale nie mia\u0142 z\u0142udze\u0144, \u017ce jeszcze ma szanse na wyzdrowienie. Przyszed\u0142 czas, \u017ce m\u0105\u017c okaza\u0142 si\u0119 pacjentem nierokuj\u0105cym, czyli takim, kt\u00f3remu trzeba wykonywa\u0107 kosztowne leczenie, a nie ma szansy na wyzdrowienie i wtedy ordynator chcia\u0142 go ,,wyrzuci\u0107\u201d ze szpitala. Po ci\u0119\u017ckich bojach,  czyli przepychankach z ordynatorem, m\u0105\u017c trafi\u0142 do hospicjum. Tam opieka by\u0142a bardzo dobra. Po \u015bmierci m\u0119\u017ca najm\u0142odsze dziecko zacz\u0119\u0142o mie\u0107 problemy, bo dosta\u0142o stresu szkolnego. Potem leczy\u0142a go psycholog. Trwa\u0142o to oko\u0142o roku. Powiedzia\u0142a, \u017ce nie ma sensu wi\u0119cej przyje\u017cd\u017ca\u0107, bo syn nie chce si\u0119 przed ni\u0105 otworzy\u0107. Nie chcia\u0142 chodzi\u0107 do szko\u0142y, zacz\u0105\u0142 si\u0119 wycofywa\u0107. A ja si\u0119 nabawi\u0142am cukrzycy ze stresu. Ale od tego momentu rozpocz\u0119\u0142am nowy etap \u017cycia.\n\nZacz\u0119\u0142am je\u017adzi\u0107 do klubu zdrowego stylu \u017cycia w po\u0142owie 2018 r. Poczu\u0142am wolno\u015b\u0107, je\u017cd\u017c\u0105c tam dwa razy w tygodniu. Mia\u0142am zmieni\u0107 swoje nawyki \u017cywieniowe i jednocze\u015bnie zacz\u0119\u0142am si\u0119 odchudza\u0107. Rozpocz\u0119\u0142am tam szkolenia na interesuj\u0105ce mnie tematy. Ucz\u0119szcza\u0142am te\u017c na zumb\u0119, \u0107wiczenia og\u00f3lnousprawniaj\u0105ce. Je\u017cd\u017c\u0119 no rowerze, czasami na basen. Organizujemy z przyjaci\u00f3\u0142k\u0105 spotkania w naszej miejscowo\u015bci i jest zainteresowanie nimi. Mniejsze albo wi\u0119ksze. W wakacje nie ma. Daje mi to satysfakcj\u0119, kopa, zdrowie, ucz\u0119 si\u0119 nowych rzeczy ca\u0142y czas. Jestem te\u017c od pocz\u0105tku we wsp\u00f3lnocie mieszkaniowej. Poczu\u0142am, \u017ce mam wp\u0142yw na to, co si\u0119 dzieje w bloku. Musia\u0142a zawi\u0105za\u0107 si\u0119 u nas w bloku wsp\u00f3lnota, bo zosta\u0142o sprzedanych kilka mieszka\u0144. To by\u0142o chyba w 2015 roku. By\u0142 problem z wyborem zarz\u0105du, bo nikt nie chcia\u0142. S\u0105siadka poda\u0142a mnie jako osob\u0119 reprezentuj\u0105c\u0105 \u2013 dodatkow\u0105 - najpierw ze strony najemc\u00f3w. Wtedy jeszcze stara\u0142am si\u0119 o wykup mieszkania. Je\u017adzi\u0142am do urz\u0119d\u00f3w skarbowych i GUS. Potem wykupi\u0142am mieszkanie i by\u0142am cz\u0142owiekiem od strony w\u0142a\u015bcicieli. Jestem wiceprezesem do dzi\u015b, a prezes jest tylko na papierze. I tak wszyscy m\u00f3wi\u0105 do mnie prezeska Uda\u0142o si\u0119 nam pozyska\u0107 fundusze unijne na termomodernizacj\u0119 bloku. Robimy to co uwa\u017camy za s\u0142uszne, czy to si\u0119 komu\u015b podoba czy nie. Trzeba by\u0142o sobie radzi\u0107 z r\u00f3\u017cnymi problemami. Po pierwsze, zmienili\u015bmy drzwi i ograniczyli\u015bmy wej\u015bcia \u201eelement\u00f3w\u201d do bloku. Musieli\u015bmy mie\u0107 w\u0142asne pieni\u0105dze. Pierwsze pieni\u0105dze posz\u0142y na drzwi, a kolejne na domofon. Tutaj by\u0142a wielka bitwa. Wiele os\u00f3b poobra\u017ca\u0142o si\u0119 na mnie. Powiedzieli, \u017ce co\u015b mi si\u0119 w g\u0142ow\u0119 porobi\u0142o. A poterm zbierali\u015bmy pieni\u0105dze na termomodernizacj\u0119. Ca\u0142y czas by\u0142y pretensje, \u017ce jest za wysoki fundusz remontowy. Potem si\u0119 okaza\u0142o, \u017ce i tak musimy dop\u0142aca\u0107. Ludzie zawsze maj\u0105 pretensj\u0119, bo stawianie granic nikomu si\u0119 nie podoba. Nie wiem czy zostan\u0119 w zarz\u0105dzie. Zale\u017cy jakie kolejne przedsi\u0119wzi\u0119cie b\u0119dziemy robi\u0107. Chcia\u0142abym instalacj\u0119 gazow\u0105 poprawi\u0107, a czy ludzie si\u0119 na to zgodz\u0105, nie wiem. Co roku zarz\u0105d dostaje absolutorium \u2013 jak u burmistrza. Raz ju\u017c zrezygnowa\u0142am na pi\u015bmie i wszyscy powiedzieli, \u017ce nikt mnie nie pu\u015bci. Zdenerwowa\u0142am si\u0119, \u017ce nikt mnie nie wspiera i jeszcze zbieram baty. Wtedy do zarz\u0105du zosta\u0142a dokooptowana jeszcze jedna osoba, kt\u00f3ra powiedzia\u0142a, \u017ce b\u0119dzie wspiera\u0107 mnie od strony merytorycznej, czyli pisanie dokument\u00f3w, sprawdzanie czego\u015b. I tak jest. Obrywamy teraz obie. Ona jest na emeryturze i ma czas siedzie\u0107 przed komputerem, a \u017ce piastowa\u0142a stanowisko dyrektorskie, wie gdzie czego szuka\u0107. Bardziej jest obyta w papierach. Ja mam dogadywa\u0107 si\u0119 z lud\u017ami, pilnowa\u0107 realizacji i wymy\u015bla\u0107 co jeszcze trzeba w bloku zrobi\u0107. Uwa\u017cam, \u017ce kto\u015b to musi robi\u0107, a zawsze to si\u0119 komu\u015b nie b\u0119dzie podoba\u0107. Mam trudniej jako kobieta. Ch\u0142op by ch\u0142opa ,,opierniczy\u0142\u201d na tym by si\u0119 sko\u0144czy\u0142o, a kobiecie nie wypada. Mam wi\u0119kszo\u015b\u0107 wrog\u00f3w. Nie odzywaj\u0105 si\u0119 do mnie, obra\u017caj\u0105 si\u0119. Raz chcieli mnie prawie pobi\u0107. Nawet wezwali policj\u0119. Nie chcia\u0142am im da\u0107 kluczy, \u017ceby weszli na dach i ustawili sobie sami anten\u0119. Przychodzili po kilka razy, a nie chcia\u0142am \u017ceby ktokolwiek chodzi\u0142 na dach. Nie ma opracowanych procedur kto mo\u017ce, a kto nie mo\u017ce, a nasze wej\u015bcie jest bardzo niebezpieczne. Nie chcia\u0142am wzi\u0105\u0107 odpowiedzialno\u015bci za ewentualny upadek klapy na czyj\u0105\u015b g\u0142ow\u0119. Byli bojowo nastawieni jak tu przychodzili. S\u0105siadka nawet naszykowa\u0142a kij i siedzia\u0142a obok, \u017ceby ratowa\u0107 razie czego\u2026 Zadzwonili po interwencj\u0119 policji, a ci - do mnie z pytaniem o co chodzi. Powiedzia\u0142am im, \u017ce udost\u0119pniam klucz tylko kominiarzom i osobom z badaniami wysoko\u015bciowymi. A oni nie maj\u0105 ich nie maj\u0105 i klucza nie dostan\u0105. \n\nReligia jest dla mnie wa\u017cna. Pomaga mi warto\u015bciowa\u0107 rzeczy. Wiele rzeczy zmieni\u0142am w swoim \u017cyciu. Jak zacz\u0119\u0142am czyta\u0107 Bibli\u0119, zacz\u0119\u0142am mie\u0107 bardziej krytyczny stosunek do ksi\u0119\u017cy, oparty na obserwacji. Zacz\u0119\u0142am spotyka\u0107 si\u0119 ze \u015awiadkami Jehowy. Nauczyli mnie czyta\u0107 Bibli\u0119. Pomagaj\u0105 mi w rzeczach prywatnych, np.: z internetem, dronami robili mi zdj\u0119cia; doradzaj\u0105 mi, jak mam jakie\u015b problemy, z kt\u00f3rymi nie wiem jak sobie poradzi\u0107. To bardzo m\u0105drzy, oczytani ludzie. Nigdy nie bra\u0142am pod uwag\u0119 przyst\u0105pienia do nich, bo uwa\u017cam, \u017ce jak urodzi\u0142am si\u0119 w wierze chrze\u015bcija\u0144skiej, to w takiej chc\u0119 umrze\u0107. Niech ka\u017cdy robi to, co uwa\u017ca, \u017ce dla niego jest dobre. Papie\u017c te\u017c ze wszystkimi rozmawia\u0142. Uwa\u017cam, \u017ce rozmowa w niczym mi nie uw\u0142acza. Papie\u017c to dla mnie autorytet. Franciszek to w og\u00f3le ewenement w\u015br\u00f3d papie\u017cy. Jego decyzje s\u0105 niepopularne w\u015br\u00f3d ksi\u0119\u017cy, bo rzeczywi\u015bcie odbieraj\u0105 im profity i przywileje. Uczy ich pokory, co im si\u0119 nie podoba, bo nauczyli si\u0119 wystawnego \u017cycia. Ka\u017cdy cz\u0142owiek pope\u0142nia b\u0142\u0119dy, a to jest tylko cz\u0142owiek. Nie \u015bledz\u0119 go tak blisko, nie wiem czy pope\u0142nia b\u0142\u0119dy. Wiem, \u017ce jest niepopularny w\u015br\u00f3d ksi\u0119\u017cy. Afera pedofilska nie powinna mie\u0107 miejsca. Jakby taki ksi\u0105dz \u2013 pedofil sta\u0142 przede mn\u0105, to bym mu mord\u0119 obi\u0142a. Krzywdzi dziecko - pope\u0142nia przest\u0119pstwo. To jest osoba, kt\u00f3ra powinna moralizowa\u0107, pokazywa\u0107 swoim \u017cyciem jak powinno ono wygl\u0105da\u0107, a to na pewno nie jest w\u0142a\u015bciwe post\u0119powanie. Chodz\u0119 do ko\u015bcio\u0142a. Nie wszystkie kazania uwa\u017cam za warto\u015bciowe, bo s\u0105 o niczym, lanie wody. Nic nie wnosz\u0105. Rzadko s\u0142ysz\u0119 o polityce w ko\u015bciele, bardziej przeszkadza mi ci\u015bnienie na kas\u0119. Ksi\u0119\u017ca za du\u017co , mieszaj\u0105 si\u0119 do polityki, ale nie \u015bledz\u0119 tego. Dla mnie to jest za daleko. Zag\u0142\u0119biam si\u0119  bardziej na sprawach mi bli\u017cszych, lokalnych. bo tutaj co\u015b mog\u0119 zmieni\u0107 Na  polityk\u0119 centraln\u0105 nie mam wp\u0142ywu. Czy b\u0119d\u0119 o tym m\u00f3wi\u0107 czy my\u015ble\u0107 - to nic nie zmieni w tym momencie. \n\nDostan\u0119 teraz 500+. Pomog\u0105 mi te pieni\u0105dze, tym bardziej, \u017ce najm\u0142odsze dziecko teraz idzie dalej do szko\u0142y. To nie jest dobra decyzja - przyznanie 500+ wszystkim. To powinno by\u0107 dla potrzebuj\u0105cych. Uwa\u017cam, \u017ce s\u0105 promowani ludzie, kt\u00f3rzy nie pracuj\u0105, a ludzie pracy nie maj\u0105 motywacji do dobrej pracy. Tak jak swoj\u0105 prac\u0119 wezm\u0119 pod uwag\u0119: ma\u0142o zarabiam, a po 40 latach pracy to za te pieni\u0105dze ani si\u0119 nie da godnie  \u017cy\u0107 ani si\u0119 nie da umrze\u0107. Ale s\u0105 ludzie z wysokimi dochodami i nie powinni dostawa\u0107 tego 500+.  Teraz mam 1 200 z\u0142 pobor\u00f3w na r\u0119k\u0119 i 1 800 z\u0142 renty po \u015bmierci m\u0119\u017ca. Mam wykupione bezczynszowe mieszkanie, ale op\u0142aty id\u0105 do g\u00f3ry. Nie siedz\u0119 w kredytach jak siedzia\u0142am. Posp\u0142aca\u0142am je, ale jak mia\u0142am wydatek na z\u0119by 10 000 z\u0142, na kt\u00f3ry nie by\u0142o mnie sta\u0107, to wraz musia\u0142am wzi\u0105\u0107 po\u017cyczk\u0119. S\u0105 wydarzenia losowe, gdzie musz\u0119 si\u0119 wspiera\u0107 po\u017cyczkami. Marzy mi si\u0119 takie. \u017bycie, aby \u017cy\u0107 na \u015brednim poziomie i nie zamartwia\u0107 si\u0119 czy starczy mi na op\u0142at\u0119 rachunk\u00f3w, wykup lek\u00f3w itp. - przyziemne. sprawy. Jestem dumna z moich dzieci, \u017ce wyros\u0142y na warto\u015bciowych ludzi, wspieramy si\u0119 w trudnych chwilach i potrafimy ze sob\u0105 rozmawia\u0107. A to s\u0105 warto\u015bci nieocenione w dzisiejszych czasach. Dla mnie bardzo wa\u017cne jest to, co cz\u0142owiek ma w sobie, a nie na sobie. I tak uczy\u0142am dzieci patrze\u0107 na \u015bwiat.\n\nG\u0142osuj\u0119 w wyborach. Na scenie politycznej nie widz\u0119 nikogo na kogo mog\u0142abym g\u0142osowa\u0107. Uwa\u017cam, \u017ce ludzie, kt\u00f3rzy mogliby rz\u0105dzi\u0107 dobrze, nie s\u0105 dopuszczani do w\u0142adzy, bo nie maj\u0105 si\u0142y przebicia. Natomiast ci, co rz\u0105dz\u0105 od dawna, im si\u0119 nie chce. S\u0105 nastawieni tylko na branie kasy. Daleko s\u0105 od rzeczywisto\u015bci. To ich rz\u0105dzenie nie ma nic wsp\u00f3lnego z czasami obecnymi. M\u0142odzi ludzie nie maj\u0105 si\u0142y przebicia, dlatego \u017ce nie maj\u0105 pieni\u0119dzy, s\u0105 blokowani przez tych starszych. Ostatnio g\u0142osowa\u0142am na Razem. Podoba mi si\u0119 to, co m\u00f3wi\u0105. S\u0105 mi bli\u017csi po prostu. Nie potrafi\u0119 okre\u015bli\u0107 czy jestem lewicowa czy prawicowa. Nie wiem co to znaczy. Jestem za tym, \u017ceby by\u0142o dobrze. Chcia\u0142abym, \u017ceby wi\u0119ksz\u0105 w\u0142adz\u0119 mia\u0142y samorz\u0105dy, \u017ceby nie by\u0142y obarczane dodatkowymi p\u0142acami. Jak co\u015b nie wyjdzie na g\u00f3rze, centralnie, to maj\u0105 uzupe\u0142nia\u0107 samorz\u0105dy. Tak jak dwuklasowy rocznik. Strasznie mi si\u0119 to nie podoba. Osoby m\u0142ode, kt\u00f3re mog\u0105 pracowa\u0107, \u017cyj\u0105 z socjalu, a nie pracuj\u0105, bo to dla nich wygodne - to powinno by\u0107 w jaki\u015b spos\u00f3b skorygowane. Np., bior\u0105c pod uwag\u0119 moj\u0105 sytuacj\u0119, gdzie jest p\u00f3\u0142sierota w domu, a my\u015bl\u0119, \u017ce nie jestem odosobniona,  to 500+ powinno by\u0107 brane od pocz\u0105tku. A bior\u0105 osoby, kt\u00f3re 500+ przeznaczaj\u0105 na nia\u0144k\u0119. To mi si\u0119 nie podoba. Teraz najbardziej nie podoba mi si\u0119 to, \u017ce pracuj\u0119 40 lat i mam tak niskie uposa\u017cenie. To nie wystarcza na prze\u017cycie. Za 1 200 z\u0142 nikt by si\u0119 nie utrzyma\u0142.

BOth these structures as well as personal changes from corporate to opensource is very important for both of them.\n\nMattias was also interested in how to run communities through edgeryders. Future conversations as well as this https://edgeryders.eu/t/community-management-manual/2245 can give insites here.\n\nErik offers to help Mattias and others interested in Sweden to connect with key figures in the open source community in sweden.\n\nEspecially with the NGO Mattias is working with some collaboration with eriks connections and edgeryders involved involved could be interesting.\n\nThe discussion also touched again on the need for change in perception of open source as it happened in the last 10 years and how similar would need to happen for crypto currencies:\n\n\u201cPeople think there is a conflict between open source and earning money\n\n10 years ago people thought that open source is for pirates\n\nIt will be the same with the crypto economy .

Jestem mam\u0105 dw\u00f3jki dzieci. Prowadz\u0119 dzia\u0142alno\u015b\u0107 gospodarcz\u0105 z przymusu, nie z wyboru, poniewa\u017c pracuj\u0119 w szkole j\u0119zykowej, kt\u00f3ra nie zatrudnia na etat, tylko wymaga albo innego zatrudnienia albo samozatrudnienia z uwagi na koszty pracownicze. To jest trudne dla pracownik\u00f3w, bo ca\u0142e koszty ZUSu spadaj\u0105 nam na g\u0142ow\u0119. Zarabiamy od pa\u017adziernika do czerwca, czyli na ca\u0142y okres wakcyjny musimy od\u0142o\u017cy\u0107 sobie pieni\u0105dze, \u017ceby przetrwa\u0107. \n\nJa akurat jestem w takiej sytuacji, \u017ce mam kredyt na mieszkanie, a ZUS i podatek te\u017c nie jest niski niestety. Kredyt wynosi co miesi\u0105c 1 300 z\u0142, plus ok. 1 300 ZUS i ok. 800 z\u0142 \u2013 podatek. Nie m\u00f3wi\u0105c ju\u017c o czynszu za mieszkanie i dodatkowych op\u0142atach r\u00f3\u017cnych. Miesi\u0119cznie mam oko\u0142o 4000 z\u0142 sta\u0142ych koszt\u00f3w miesi\u0119cznie. Koszty gazu dzielimy z ma\u0142\u017conkiem, ale poniewa\u017c mieszkanie jest na mnie, wi\u0119c ja ponosz\u0119 koszty mieszkania. On oczywi\u015bcie dok\u0142ada si\u0119 do \u017cycia, do zakup\u00f3w i spraw bie\u017c\u0105cych. A i jeszcze ubezpieczenie na samoch\u00f3d. Tak\u017ce koszt\u00f3w jest sporo. My\u015bl\u0119, \u017ce nie zarabiam ma\u0142o, ale tak w przeliczeniu na wszystkie miesi\u0105ce w roku, to nie jest super pensja, bior\u0105c te\u017c pod uwag\u0119 nak\u0142ad pracy. \n\nPraca, poza byciem aktywn\u0105 w godzinach pracy, wymaga ode mnie bardzo du\u017co przygotowa\u0144. W momencie, w kt\u00f3rym pojawi\u0142y si\u0119 dzieci, to robi si\u0119 k\u0142opotliwe. Cz\u0119sto zarywam noce, cz\u0119sto jestem niewyspana. Odk\u0105d starszy syn poszed\u0142 do przedszkola, a nie by\u0142o jeszcze c\u00f3rki, to by\u0142o prostsze, bo mia\u0142am przedpo\u0142udnia dla siebie. W tym roku, kiedy c\u00f3rka sko\u0144czy osiem miesi\u0119cy, wracam do pracy z my\u015bl\u0105 o tym, \u017ceby od\u0142o\u017cy\u0107 pieni\u0105dze. Teraz mam zasi\u0142ek macierzy\u0144ski - ok. 7 000 z\u0142 miesi\u0119cznie. Wtedy by\u0142a taka mo\u017cliwo\u015b\u0107, \u017ce mo\u017cna by\u0142o zap\u0142aci\u0107 jedn\u0105 wysok\u0105 i od razu wchodzi\u0142o si\u0119 na ten pr\u00f3g wysokiej wyp\u0142aty. Bez tego wysokiego zasi\u0142ku nie wiem czy zdecydowa\u0142abym si\u0119 na drugie dziecko. Mimo tego, \u017ce mam poczucie stabilnej sytuacji finansowej, koszty s\u0105 gigantyczne. M\u0105\u017c rozwija swoj\u0105 firm\u0119 i ma du\u017ce nak\u0142ady finansowe. To sprawia, \u017ce nie odk\u0142adamy du\u017co w trakcie roku. Ca\u0142y czas w co\u015b inwestujemy, on uzbraja swoj\u0105 firm\u0119. Cz\u0119sto by\u0142o tak, \u017ce musia\u0142am sobie dodawa\u0107 grupy. Pracowa\u0142am w szkole z 6 grupami, a potem okazywa\u0142o si\u0119, \u017ce ledwo \u0142\u0105czy nam si\u0119 bud\u017cet, wi\u0119c do\u0142o\u017cy\u0142am sobie dwie grupy. Mia\u0142am osiem grup w skrajnym czasie. To by\u0142o bardzo du\u017ce obci\u0105\u017cenie. Wtedy w og\u00f3le nie mia\u0142am czasu dla siebie, bo i weekendy i przedpo\u0142udnia i czas po pracy do 21:00 po\u015bwi\u0119ca\u0142am wy\u0142\u0105cznie na prac\u0119. \n\nTeraz teoretycznie jestem na urlopie macierzy\u0144skim, kt\u00f3ry nie ma z urlopem nic wsp\u00f3lnego, bo pior\u0119, sprz\u0105tam, organizuj\u0119 wszystko co mo\u017cna zorganizowa\u0107. Chocia\u017c ostatnio postawi\u0142am si\u0119 i raz na dwa tygodnie przychodzi do nas pani, kt\u00f3ra pomaga mi sprz\u0105ta\u0107, bo nie ogarniam g\u00f3ry prania. Pozwalam sobie na taki luksus. M\u0105\u017c opiekuje si\u0119 dzie\u0107mi wtedy kiedy mo\u017ce, np.: rano przed prac\u0105, je\u015bli idzie na p\u00f3\u017aniejsz\u0105 godzin\u0119, to przejmuje c\u00f3rk\u0119, \u017cebym mog\u0142a odespa\u0107. W nocy ja j\u0105 karmi\u0119 i budz\u0119 si\u0119 do niej. On codziennie odwozi syna do przedszkola. Kiedy wcze\u015bniej ko\u0144czy te\u017c odbiera go z przedszkola. Dora\u017anie pomaga nam moja mama, je\u015bli jest taka potrzeba. Wcze\u015bniej pomaga\u0142a nam regularnie: przychodzi\u0142\u0105 dwa razy w tygodniu i opiekowa\u0142a si\u0119 dzieckiem. Na razie system pracy popo\u0142udniowej jest dla mnie idealny.  Mog\u0119 by\u0107 z dzieckiem rano i sp\u0119dzam z nim czas, a po po\u0142udniu ju\u017c kto\u015b mo\u017c\u0119 si\u0119 dzie\u0107mi zaj\u0105\u0107. Bardzo zale\u017ca\u0142o mi na tym, \u017ceby nie oddawa\u0107 dzieci pod opiek\u0119 osobom trzecim \u2013 nianiom, bo znam przypadki totalnych wtop, je\u015bli chodzi o opiekunki. To jest dla mnie zbyt istotny temat, \u017ceby tak po prostu odda\u0107 dziecko komu\u015b obcemu. Dlatego ten system pracy mi odpowiada. Problem zacznie si\u0119 teraz, gdy syn p\u00f3jdzie do przedszkola, ja b\u0119d\u0119 ju\u017c aktywna zawodowo. W tamtym roku by\u0142am na zwolnieniu w trakcie roku, a w tym syn p\u00f3jdzie rano do przedszkola, ja by\u0107 mo\u017ce b\u0119d\u0119 go odbiera\u0142a, \u017ceby sp\u0119dzi\u0107 z nim chwil\u0119. Po czym b\u0119d\u0119 jecha\u0142a do szko\u0142y i wraca\u0142a p\u00f3\u017anym wieczorem, \u017ceby po\u0142o\u017cy\u0107 c\u00f3rk\u0119 spa\u0107. I w tym momencie praktycznie nie widuj\u0119 si\u0119 z w\u0142asnym synem. Na szcz\u0119\u015bcie mam teraz mo\u017cliwo\u015b\u0107 pracowa\u0107 z czterema grupami, czyli tak jakby na p\u00f3\u0142 etatu, wi\u0119c b\u0119d\u0119 wcze\u015bniej ko\u0144czy\u0142a. Ale kiedy ta praca zrobi si\u0119 pe\u0142noetatowa, b\u0119dzie du\u017cy problem. Mam mn\u00f3stwo hobby, kt\u00f3rych na razie nie realizuj\u0119 ze wzgl\u0119du na dzieci, ale nie mam te\u017c z tego powodu \u017calu, bo s\u0105 najwa\u017cniejsze dla mnie i marzy\u0142am o nich ca\u0142e \u017cycie. Aczkolwiek mam wielokrotnie poczucie wypalenia macierzy\u0144skiego i mimo tego, \u017ce m\u0105\u017c wsp\u00f3\u0142uczestniczy \u2013 nie chc\u0119 u\u017cywa\u0107 s\u0142owa pomaga \u2013 on uczestniczy w wychowaniu dzieci, jednak 90% obowi\u0105zk\u00f3w spada na mnie. Z w\u0142asnego wyboru karmi\u0119 piersi\u0105, bo mia\u0142am zagro\u017con\u0105 laktacj\u0119, a wywalczy\u0142am j\u0105 ponownie \u015bwiadomie. C\u00f3rka jest tak\u0105 osob\u0105, k\u00f3ra wymaga mamy. I kiedy zostaje z kim\u015b na d\u0142u\u017cej ni\u017c godzin\u0119, to jest histeria. Si\u0142\u0105 rzeczy jestem z ni\u0105 non stop. Po czterech miesi\u0105cach to zaczyna by\u0107 troch\u0119 m\u0119cz\u0105ce. \n\n**_Praca, pasja, zasi\u0142ki_** \n\nMarzy mi si\u0119 wypad ze znajomymi nad jezioro czy na narty bez poczucia winy czy te\u017c powr\u00f3t do biegania. Raz by\u0142am nawet biega\u0107. Po czym okaza\u0142o si\u0119, \u017ce c\u00f3rka zachorowa\u0142a i obie trafi\u0142y\u015bmy do szpitala \u2013 ja wycie\u0144czona, ona wycie\u0144czona. Nie mia\u0142am si\u0142y na bieganie. Bieganie mo\u017ce by\u0107 o 21, kiedy dziecko ju\u017c za\u015bnie, co nie jest do ko\u0144ca komfortowe. Teraz jest widno, ale zdarzy\u0142o mi si\u0119 biega\u0107 po 22. Czuj\u0119 l\u0119k jako kobieta, czuj\u0119 si\u0119 zagro\u017cona, biegn\u0105c wieczorem ulic\u0105. S\u0142ysza\u0142am historie z Polski. Osobi\u015bcie nie mia\u0142am takiej sytuacji, \u017ceby kto\u015b mnie goni\u0142 albo nastraszy\u0142, ale to jest taka asekuracja z mojej strony. Takie uczucuie jako kobiecie mi towarzyszy. Wol\u0119 biega\u0107 w dzie\u0144, a nie w nocy. Po 8 miesi\u0105cach wracam do pracy g\u0142\u00f3wnie z powod\u00f3w finansowych, \u017ceby troch\u0119 od\u0142o\u017cy\u0107 i \u017ceby p\u00f3\u017aniej by\u0142o nam \u0142atwiej.\n\nPoza zasi\u0142kiem macierzy\u0144skim, raz korzysta\u0142am ze wsparcia pa\u0144stwa. By\u0142am przez chwil\u0119 zarejestrowana jako osoba bezrobotna w chwili mojego zawrotu \u017cyciowego. Po tym jak rozsta\u0142am si\u0119 z \u00f3wczesnm partnerem, wr\u00f3ci\u0142am z Katowic, gdzie mia\u0142am cudown\u0105 prac\u0119, w kt\u00f3rej \u0142\u0105czy\u0142am anglistyk\u0119 i psychologi\u0119. Straci\u0142am wszelkie \u017ar\u00f3d\u0142a dochodu. Przesta\u0142am te\u017c by\u0107 wtedy ubezpieczona. Dlatego zarejestrowa\u0142am si\u0119 jako bezrobotna. Nie nale\u017ca\u0142 mi si\u0119 zasi\u0142ek. Potem zatrudni\u0142am si\u0119 w prywatnym przedszkolu, gdzie pracowa\u0142am przedpo\u0142udniami, a popo\u0142udniami - w szkole j\u0119zykowej. Wtedy nie musia\u0142am prowadzi\u0107 dzia\u0142alno\u015bci gospodarczej. To by\u0142o idealne, ale nie w momencie, gdy ma si\u0119 rodzin\u0119, bo wtedy nie by\u0142o mnie w domu od 8:00-21:00. Funkcjonowa\u0142am tak przez 4 lata - jeszcze przed m\u0119\u017cem i dzie\u0107mi. Dzi\u0119ki temu zdoby\u0142am zdolno\u015b\u0107 kredytow\u0105 i kupi\u0142am mieszkanie, wyremontowa\u0142am je, zdoby\u0142am do\u015bwiadczenie zawodowe. Zrobi\u0142am wtedy r\u00f3\u017cne kursy, m.in. kurs trenerski. Mam wi\u0119ksz\u0105 samo\u015bwiadomo\u015b\u0107, na pewno kontakty rozleg\u0142e i praktyk\u0119 zawodow\u0105. Te cztery lata har\u00f3wy da\u0142y mi te\u017c takie poczucie, \u017ce jak si\u0119 dobrze zorganizuj\u0119, to mog\u0119 du\u017co z siebie wycisn\u0105\u0107. Mia\u0142am taki jeden bardzo aktywny rok. Poza tym, \u017ce rano pracowa\u0142am w przedszkolu,  popo\u0142udniami - w szkole j\u0119zykowej, dawa\u0142am korepetycje. Co drugi weekend mia\u0142am zjazdy w szkole trener\u00f3w organizacji pozarz\u0105dowych. A w maju kole\u017canka zapyta\u0142a czy nie chcia\u0142abym pom\u00f3c jej w organizacji parady Schumana w Warszawie z okazji oobchod\u00f3w przyst\u0105pienia do Unii Europejskiej. Mia\u0142am tylko prowadzi\u0107 warsztaty dla grupy z Turcji, po czym okaza\u0142o si\u0119, \u017ce jeszcze robi\u0119 t\u0142umaczenie i tysi\u0105c innych rzeczy. Wtedy to ju\u017c naprawd\u0119 nie spa\u0142am w og\u00f3le. Przyp\u0142aci\u0142am to zdrowiem, bo mia\u0142am stan przedzawa\u0142owy. Trafi\u0142am do szpitala.  Na szcz\u0119\u015bcie wtedy by\u0142am u rodzic\u00f3w, a nie sama. To by\u0142 taki sygna\u0142 od organizmu, \u017ce to tyle je\u015bli chodzi o aktywno\u015b\u0107 i zm\u0119czenie. Mia\u0142am wrzuci\u0107 na luz, ale nie wysz\u0142o. Zabra\u0142a mnie karetka i by\u0142am na SOR (przyp.: Szpitalny Oddzia\u0142 Ratunkowy). Mia\u0142am EKG, badania krwi. Sp\u0119dzi\u0142am noc w szpitalu, ale nie stwierdzono zawa\u0142u i na drugi dzie\u0144 wypisano mnie do domu z zaleceniem oszcz\u0119dzania si\u0119. Potem mia\u0142am za\u0142o\u017cony holter. By\u0142 mega \u015bmierdz\u0105cy, po osobie, kt\u00f3ra go dopiero zdj\u0119\u0142a i nie zmieniono pask\u00f3w. Gdy przyjecha\u0142am go zdj\u0105\u0107 okaza\u0142o si\u0119, \u017ce co\u015b nie zadzia\u0142a\u0142o w trakcie odczytu i ca\u0142e badanie wzi\u0119\u0142o w \u0142eb. Panie nie mog\u0142y go odczyta\u0107. Potem okaza\u0142o si\u0119, \u017ce wszystko zosta\u0142o skasowane bezpowrotnie, poniewa\u017c kadra zgrywaj\u0105ca nie by\u0142a przygotowana. Pani pyta\u0142a mnie jak co\u015b zrobi\u0107. Jak chcia\u0142am ponownie zrobi\u0107 badanie, trzeba by\u0142o czeka\u0107 kolejne dwa miesi\u0105ce, bo holter by\u0142 ju\u017c zarezerwowany dla kolejnej osoby. \n\t\nPo ostatnim porodzie mia\u0142am zapalenie piersi, kt\u00f3re nie by\u0142o odpowiednio prowadzone. Moja ginekolog doradzi\u0142a mi wyciskanie mleka na si\u0142\u0119. To by\u0142o ju\u017c w stanie ostrym. Najpierw nie dobrano mi antybiotyku, bo by\u0142 za s\u0142aby. Trzy razy odnawia\u0142 si\u0119 stan zapalny. W trzeciej fazie by\u0142o na tyle \u017ale, \u017ce w piersi pojawi\u0142 si\u0119 gronkowiec, kt\u00f3ry doprowadzi\u0142 do ropnia piersi. Do tego doprowadzi\u0142y te\u017c chyba z\u0142e rady lekarzy, kt\u00f3rzy podali mi oksytocyn\u0119 przez nos, \u017ceby zwi\u0119kszy\u0107 produkcj\u0119 mleka i zalecili gor\u0105cy prysznic z wyciskaniem mleka na si\u0142\u0119 z piersi. Najpierw odci\u0105gano rop\u0119 z piersi, twierdz\u0105c, \u017ce nie trzeba b\u0119dzie robi\u0107 naci\u0119cia. Te dzia\u0142ania trwa\u0142y tydzie\u0144. Potem by\u0142o lepiej, ale pani profesor stwierdzi\u0142a, \u017ce jednak trzeba naci\u0105\u0107 t\u0119 pier\u015b. Po\u0142o\u017cy\u0142a mnie do szpitala z za\u0142o\u017ceniem, \u017ce natnie pier\u015b, oczy\u015bci j\u0105  i b\u0119d\u0119 mog\u0142a wr\u00f3ci\u0107 do karmienia. Ju\u017c przed zabiegiem sugerowano, \u017cebym zaprzesta\u0142a laktacj\u0119 i zaproponowano mi lek, k\u00f3rego skutki uboczne to np.: udar m\u00f3zgu, zawa\u0142 serca, padaczka. Zacz\u0119\u0142am go bra\u0107 w szpitalu. Piel\u0119gniarki nie ogarnia\u0142y czy leki zosta\u0142y mi podane czy nie. Tak naprawd\u0119 sama musia\u0142am kontrolowa\u0107 jakie leki, w jakiej dawce dostaj\u0119. Chirurg, kt\u00f3ry mia\u0142 nacina\u0107 pier\u015b, zapyta\u0142 czy chcia\u0142abym karmi\u0107. Na co odpowiedzia\u0142am, \u017ce je\u015bli daje mi na to nadziej\u0119: to tak, bardzo chcia\u0142abym karmi\u0107. Nie wyt\u0142umaczy\u0142 mi nic. Naci\u0105\u0142 mi pier\u015b na granicy otoczki, przez co nie mia\u0142am mo\u017cliwo\u015bci odci\u0105gania mleka laktatorem. Gdyby naci\u0105\u0142 j\u0105 3 cm wy\u017cej, proces gojenia i powrotu do laktacji by\u0142by du\u017co prostszy. Wszyscy lekarze w szpitalu twierdzili, \u017ce pier\u015b trzeba banda\u017cowa\u0107 i musz\u0119 jak najszybciej zako\u0144czy\u0107 laktacj\u0119, \u017ceby rana si\u0119 zagoi\u0142a. Dosta\u0142am w tym czasie depresji, bo karmienie jest dla mnie bardzo wa\u017cne. Na szcz\u0119\u015bcie na mojej drodze stan\u0119\u0142a doradczyni laktacyjna, kt\u00f3ra przedstawi\u0142a mi badania naukowe: od 12 lat w innych miastach w Polsce ropie\u0144 piersi jest leczony bez zaprzestania laktacji. W szpitalu zg\u0142asza\u0142am zawroty g\u0142owy i z\u0142y stan psychiczny, bo mleko przesta\u0142o lecie\u0107 w moich piersiach. Nikt si\u0119 tym nie przej\u0105\u0142. Doradczyni laktacyjna powiedzia\u0142a, \u017ce je\u015bli jej zaufam, wr\u00f3c\u0119 do karmienia. Zaj\u0119\u0142o to ok. dw\u00f3ch tygodni. Od razu odstawi\u0142am te lekarstwa. Zacz\u0119\u0142am bra\u0107 zio\u0142a i robi\u0107 wizualizacje tego, \u017ce karmi\u0119 naturalnie. Po dw\u00f3ch tygodniach przystawi\u0142am dziecko do piersi. Karmi\u0142am na pocz\u0105tku w opatrunku. Pier\u015b goi\u0142a si\u0119 miesi\u0105c. No, ale si\u0119 uda\u0142o. To jest te\u017c dow\u00f3d na to, \u017ce lekarze s\u0105 niewykszta\u0142ceni na poziomie profesorskim. Doktor przyzna\u0142a, \u017ce zajmuje si\u0119 bardziej operacjami plastycznymi ni\u017c laktacj\u0105. O to mam \u017cal do naszej s\u0142u\u017cby zdrowia, \u017ce nie dbaj\u0105 kompletnie o pacjenta. \n\nDla dzieci mam lekark\u0119 prowadz\u0105c\u0105 w publicznej plac\u00f3wce. Wieczorem, gdy jest sytuacja kryzysowa, umawiamy si\u0119 z ni\u0105 czasem prywatnie. Ginekologicznie korzysta\u0142am z mojej lekarki na NFZ, natomiast badania typu USG ci\u0105\u017cy wykonywa\u0142am prywatnie ze wzgl\u0119du na okres oczekiwania i na to jak si\u0119 zwracano do mnie w trakcie tego badania. pan na pierwszym USG stwierdzi\u0142, \u017ce ma za s\u0142aby sprz\u0119t, nie jest w stanie zbada\u0107 mi przezierno\u015bci karku i sugeruje wizyt\u0119 prywatn\u0105 na lepszym sprz\u0119cie. Takie badanie mo\u017cna wykona\u0107 do 2 tygodni. Gdybym by\u0142a w pierwszej ci\u0105\u017cy i nie mia\u0142a pieni\u0119dzy, prawdopodobnie by\u0142abym w du\u017cym stresie i nie wiedzia\u0142abym gdzie si\u0119 uda\u0107. Okres oczekiwania na badania takiego maluszka trwa sze\u015b\u0107 miesi\u0119cy.  Od momentu urodzenia c\u00f3rki \u2013 na siebie i na ni\u0105 - wyda\u0142am ok. 5 tys. z\u0142 na wizyty i badania. Po naci\u0119ciu piersi. Wszystkie koszty leczenia ponosz\u0119 zawsze prywatnie. Okulista dla dzieci, ortopeda  - prywatnie - ze wzgl\u0119du na kolejki i na to, \u017ce wybieram \u015bwiadomie specjalist\u00f3w. Czas oczekiwania na ortoped\u0119 to ok. p\u00f3\u0142 roku, a pierwsza wizyta powinna si\u0119 odby\u0107 w ci\u0105gu 4 tygodni od porodu.To niewykonalne. S\u0142u\u017cba zdrowia kompletnie nie spe\u0142nia swojej funkcji. Jestem zwolenniczk\u0105 tego, \u017ceby nie p\u0142aci\u0107 na ZUS sk\u0142adki chorobowej. Jestem za prywatyzacj\u0105 s\u0142u\u017cby zdrowia w Polsce. Uwa\u017cam, \u017ce dzi\u0119ki temu znacznie skr\u00f3ci\u0142yby si\u0119 kolejki, poniewa\u017c osoby siedz\u0105ce w przychodniach tak po prostu, blokuj\u0105 dost\u0119p do lekarzy. Uwa\u017cam, \u017ce ka\u017cdy powinien zadba\u0107 o siebie. Mo\u017ce nie jestem za bardzo lewicowa w tym wzgl\u0119dzie. P\u0142ac\u0105c sk\u0142adki ZUS, utrzymuj\u0119 te\u017c osoby leniwe, a sama nie mam gwarancji, \u017ce jak\u0105kolwiek emerytur\u0119 uzyskam, czy b\u0119dzie to emerytura godna. Nie mam tego do ko\u0144ca przemy\u015blanego jak to powinno wygl\u0105da\u0107. W szpitalu dzieci\u0119cym w Lublinie jest pediatra, kt\u00f3ra pierwszy raz w \u017cyciu potraktowa\u0142a mnie jak matk\u0119 \u2013 tak jak chcia\u0142abym by\u0107 potraktowana przez lekarza. Podesz\u0142a do mnie, uspokajaj\u0105co zacz\u0119\u0142a t\u0142umaczy\u0107 co si\u0119 dzieje z moim dzieckiem, jakie leki poda. Doda\u0142a, \u017ce musz\u0119 na siebie uwa\u017ca\u0107. Zapyta\u0142a czy mam wod\u0119. Zorganizowa\u0142a mi fotel do siedzenia przy dziecku, przynios\u0142a prze\u015bcierad\u0142o do przykrycia. Ca\u0142y czas podkre\u015bla\u0142a, \u017ce jest tu dla mnie i je\u015bli mam jakiekolwiek pytania, za chwil\u0119 przyjdzie. By\u0142a kompletnie wspieraj\u0105ca. Jedna jedyna osoba na tyle spotka\u0144 medycznych.\n\n**_Polityka i ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 w Polsce_** \n\nNie wiem czy jest jaka\u015b partia, kt\u00f3ra o tym m\u00f3wi. Nie zg\u0142\u0119bia\u0142am program\u00f3w partii. Najbli\u017cej jest mi do Wiosny. Aczkolwiek po ostatnich wyborach do eurloparlamentu w moich oczach z partii pozytywnej i ambitnej zaprezentowali si\u0119 troch\u0119 infantylnie przez zachowania Biedronia. Taka euforia i m\u00f3wienie o zwyci\u0119stwie przy 6 procentowym poparciu. Rozczarowali mnie. My\u015bla\u0142am, \u017ce b\u0119d\u0105 mieli bardziej dojrza\u0142e zachowania. Ma\u0142ymi zachowaniami podwa\u017caj\u0105 sw\u00f3j autorytet w moich oczach. \n\nNie wiem na kogo mog\u0142abym zag\u0142osowa\u0107 w wyborach prezydenckich. W wyborach parlamentarnych liczy\u0142abym na Koalicj\u0119, lewic\u0119 i Wiosn\u0119 \u2013 \u017ce wszyscy si\u0119 zjednocz\u0105 przeciwko PISowi, \u017ceby odsun\u0105\u0107 go od w\u0142adzy. To, co wyprawiaj\u0105 jest sprzeczne z moimi pogl\u0105dami. Chcia\u0142abym zag\u0142osowa\u0107 na jaki\u015b taki zlepek PO, SLD, Wiosny, Razem, \u017ceby zaproponowali co\u015b wsp\u00f3lnego. Generalnie, je\u015bli chodzi o wszystkie aspekty, bli\u017cej mi do partii lewicowych, ale nie w aspekcie ekonomicznym, bo nie chcia\u0142abym p\u0142aci\u0107 50% podatku, chyba \u017ce przychody by\u0142yby du\u017co wy\u017csze, tak jak w Skandynawii. Popieram postulaty LGTQ, jestem za r\u00f3wnouprawnieniem, za rozdzia\u0142em ko\u015bcio\u0142a i pa\u0144stwa. Chcia\u0142abym jak najlepiej dla siebie. Aczkolwiek nie jest tak, \u017ce chcia\u0142abym ola\u0107 wszystkie inne osoby. Mam \u015bwiadomo\u015b\u0107, \u017ce powinien by\u0107 jaki\u015b fundusz dla os\u00f3b z niepe\u0142nosprawno\u015bciami. Jestem za totalnym wsparciem os\u00f3b, kt\u00f3re nie z w\u0142asnego wyboru nie mog\u0105 sobie poradzi\u0107 albo nie mog\u0105 pracowa\u0107. Np.: matki samotnie wychowuj\u0105ce dzieci albo w ci\u0105\u017cy. Ale jestem totalnie przeciwna by dostawa\u0142y je nieroby. Tak jak ma to miejsce teraz, gdy w totalnie g\u0142upi spos\u00f3b s\u0105 rozdawane pieni\u0105dze. Jestem za m\u0105dr\u0105, rozs\u0105dn\u0105 polityk\u0105, chocia\u017c nie wydaje mi si\u0119, by jaka\u015b partia to proponowa\u0142a. Mo\u017ce najbli\u017cej mi do Barbary Nowackiej, kt\u00f3ra ma takie rozs\u0105dne podej\u015bcie, \u017ceby zwi\u0119kszy\u0107 fundusz na osoby z niepe\u0142nosprawno\u015bciami, \u017ceby dba\u0107 o osoby, kt\u00f3re zale\u017c\u0105 od alimenciarzy, by pomaga\u0107 faktycznie potrzebuj\u0105cym, a nie tym co zrobili sobie z polityki pomocowej pa\u0144stwa filzofi\u0119 \u017cycia. G\u0142osuj\u0119 i uwa\u017cam, \u017ce to obowi\u0105zek obywatelski, a nie g\u0142osuj\u0105c, odbieram sobie prawo do krytykowania. Gdyby wszyscy zag\u0142osowali, by\u0142yby prawdziwy obraz Polski, a przy 40 procentowej frekwencji, trudno go uzyska\u0107. Jestem za\u0142amana, \u017ce wielu moich znajomych lobbuje za tym, \u017ceby nie g\u0142osowa\u0107. Medialnie mamy Polsk\u0119 podzielon\u0105 na praw\u0105 i lew\u0105 \u2013 pogl\u0105dowo i wzd\u0142u\u017c linii Wis\u0142y. Polska zachodnia \u2013 bardziej otwarta na zmiany, i wschodnia \u2013 prawicowa. Patrz\u0105c na pogl\u0105dy moich znajomych to nie jest tylko taki dwudzielny wymiar, bo mam znajomych o lewicowych, centralnych, ale te\u017c o prawicowych pogl\u0105dach nawet w rodzinie. Ale ta prawicowo\u015b\u0107 wynika z zakorzenienia ko\u015bcielnego, a nie z pogl\u0105d\u00f3w politycznych. Mam \u015bwiadomo\u015b\u0107, \u017ce jest te\u017c grupa, kt\u00f3ra nie interesuje si\u0119 polityk\u0105, po prostu \u017cyj\u0105 sobie oraz taka bez \u017cadnej wiedzy z w\u0142asnej g\u0142upoty. \n\nDo niedawna du\u017cym autorytetem by\u0142 dla mnie prof. D\u0119bski, je\u015bli chodzi o wiedz\u0119 i o pogl\u0105dy, odawag\u0119 m\u00f3wienia tego, co my\u015bli, ale on ju\u017c niestety nie \u017cyje. Dla mnie du\u017cym autorytetem jest Krystyna Janda, kt\u00f3ra anga\u017cuje si\u0119 politycznie, ale nie w krzykliwy spos\u00f3b; robi co\u015b i dzia\u0142a, ale nie jest nachalna w tych swoich pogl\u0105dach. Jerzy Owsiak jest dla mnie ogromnym autorytetem. Nawet w kontek\u015bcie \u015bmierci Adamowicza przyj\u0105\u0142 na siebie ci\u0119\u017car odpowiedzialno\u015bci za to co si\u0119 sta\u0142o. To jak zareagowa\u0142 emocjonalnie, odchodz\u0105c, po to, \u017ceby zamkn\u0105\u0107 te g\u0119by pluj\u0105ce na fundacj\u0119. I te\u017c przez to jak wyslucha\u0142 szeregu ludzi i powiedzia\u0142, \u017ce dobra zareagowa\u0142em emocjonalnie, ale dla dobra wy\u017cszej sprawy, wracam. Du\u017cym autorytetem jest te\u017c dla mnie siostra Chmielewska, kt\u00f3ra na co dzie\u0144 pomaga ludziom potrzebuj\u0105cym. Jest bardzo rozs\u0105dna, potrafi skrytykowa\u0107 ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142, do kt\u00f3rego nale\u017cy. Ma du\u017cy takt. Bardzo lubi\u0119 s\u0142ucha\u0107 tego, co ma do powiedzenia. \n\nMoja duchowo\u015b\u0107 skupia si\u0119 na tym, co tu i teraz. Przez zdrowotne do\u015bwiadczenia ostatnich miesi\u0119cy \u017cyj\u0119 po prostu zdrowo. Sprowadza si\u0119 to do takiego m\u0105drego egzystowania na co dzie\u0144. Duchowo\u015b\u0107 nie jest powi\u0105zania z bogiem, ale bardziej z kontemplowaniem przyrody, pi\u0119kna \u017cycia. Po porodzie to taka prosta duchowo\u015b\u0107, skupiaj\u0105ca si\u0119 na ma\u0142ych elementach \u017cycia, kt\u00f3re kszta\u0142tuj\u0105 ka\u017cdy dzie\u0144. To jest dla mnie cenne: u\u015bmiech dziecka, zdrowie rodzinne, relacje z partnerem/m\u0119\u017cem, kontemplowanie i dbanie o natur\u0119, ch\u0119\u0107 niesienia pomocy innym ludziom. Np.: przeprowadza\u0142am akcj\u0119 ubierania drzew w zimie, rozdawanie kurtek potrzebuj\u0105cym. Minimalne - ale na tyle na ile mog\u0142am w ci\u0105\u017cy \u2013 zaanga\u017cowanie w food not bombs. Chcemy nauczy\u0107 dzieci tego, by umia\u0142y by\u0107 szcz\u0119\u015bliwe w zwariowanym \u015bwiecie, by by\u0142y dobre dla siebie nawzajem i dla innych, by nie postrzega\u0142y sukcesu przez pryzmat pieni\u0105dza. \n\nZmor\u0105 naszych czas\u00f3w jest postrzeganie cz\u0142owieka przez pryzmat jego dokona\u0144 biznesowych; nie chc\u0119, \u017ceby by\u0142y konsumpcyjnie nastawione do \u015bwiata; \u017ceby chcia\u0142y czyta\u0107, chcia\u0142y si\u0119 kszta\u0142ci\u0107; nie by\u0142y zak\u0142amane; \u017ceby nie ba\u0142y si\u0119 m\u00f3wi\u0107 \u201enie\u201d; \u017ceby potrafi\u0142y oceni\u0107, \u017ce co\u015b jest z\u0142e, nawet je\u015bli to jest dzia\u0142anie cz\u0142owieka, k\u00f3ry ma szacunek. Cho\u0107by w kontek\u015bcie pedofilii - \u017ceby jasno komunikowa\u0142y swoje potrzeby. \u017beby mia\u0142y otwarte umys\u0142y i chcia\u0142y pod\u00f3\u017cowa\u0107; by nikogo nie ocenia\u0142y przez stopie\u0144 sprawno\u015bci, przez to z kim kto sypia. Wa\u017cne s\u0105 dla mnie zwierz\u0119ta i przyroda. Czasem reaguj\u0119, a  czasem nie. Np.: jad\u0105 ludzie samochodem i wyrzucaj\u0105 niedop\u0142a\u0142ki papieros\u00f3w przez okno. To dla mnie brak \u015bwiadomo\u015bci, \u017ce matka ziemia jest naszym domem i brak odpowiedzialno\u015bci za Ziemi\u0119. Strasznie mnie to wkurza w ludziach i mo\u017ce dlatego nasza c\u00f3rka nazywa si\u0119 Gaja, \u017ceby podkre\u015bli\u0107, \u017ce to dla nas istotne. W zesz\u0142ym roku w szkole zorganizowa\u0142m akcj\u0119 zbierania \u015bmieci. Zebra\u0142o si\u0119 ponad 40 os\u00f3b, w tym niekt\u00f3rzy lektorzy stawili si\u0119 w lesie. Zebrali\u015bmy ok. 300 kg \u015bmieci pozostawionych przez ludzi.\n\nNa zako\u0144czenie chcia\u0142abym doda\u0107, \u017ce nienawidz\u0119 ko\u015bcio\u0142a i jestem o krok od z\u0142o\u017cenia dokument\u00f3w o apostazji. Nie chrzcimy swoich dzieci, nie chc\u0119 mie\u0107 \u015blubu ani pogrzebu ko\u015bcielnego. Uwa\u017cam, \u017ce episkopat powinien zosta\u0107 rozwi\u0105zany. Ub\u00f3stwiam Sekielskiego za to, \u017ce zrobi\u0142 ten dokument, \u017ce napisze ksi\u0105\u017ck\u0119, \u017ce \u015bciga tych ludzi, \u017ce m\u00f3wi otwartym tekstem. Nienawidz\u0119 zak\u0142ama\u0144 prymas\u00f3w. Brzydz\u0119 si\u0119 tym. Za to te\u017c nienawidz\u0119 polityk\u00f3w. Kuba W\u0105t\u0142y jest dla mnie autorytetem. Prowadzi w internecie program \u201eKuba W\u0105t\u0142y TV\u201d. Jest wkurwiony na rzeczywisto\u015b\u0107. M\u00f3wi co go boli. Lobbuje za tym, \u017ceby przesta\u0107 finansowa\u0107 ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 z podatk\u00f3w. Gdyby by\u0142 finansowany z pieni\u0119dzy ludzi, okaza\u0142oby si\u0119 ile jest tak naprawd\u0119 wierz\u0105cych i jakimi samochodami przestaliby je\u017adzi\u0107 ksi\u0119\u017ca.

You see, I had this idea some time ago when I heard that so many creative young entrepreneurs like yourself (and myself!) find it impossible to get financial support and start-up capital from conventional funders - like VCs or banks - and turn to family and friends to fund their ventures. This was certainly my case at the Hub - no one in Milan gave me a penny to start this social enterprise, and only gave us bank accounts when we underwrote them with personal savings. That's when my mum stepped forth and funded the start-up of the Hub. So I thought: since this seems to be the story of so many entrepreneurs, why isn't the policy world taking more notice of this and rewarding parents that invest in the future by funding their children's ventures?\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n<a href=\"http://www.amando.it/imagesdyn/articoli/19/17/15462.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.amando.it/imagesdyn/articoli/19/17/15462.jpg\" style=\"width: 432px; height: 346px;\"></a>\n\n", "created_at": "2011-11-21 21:18:39", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:10.764453", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 212, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 85194, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 14460, "post_number": 84, "raw": "I have saved the chat if you would like to see that for reference @LauraRoddy", "created_at": "2020-10-16 13:10:11.416709", "updated_at": "2020-10-16 13:10:11.416709", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 15, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 1.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [85192], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62599, "user_id": 3206, "topic_id": 11311, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Cao Elena!\n\nHvala sto si podijelila svoju pricu.

Velikoj vecini ljudi treba puno vremena i istrazivanja da skinu sve te slojeve, slagane tu od rodjenja, da bi dosli do sustine svog bica.

Doduse, najveca greska sto mi svi radimo je da prekidamo uciti kad zavrsimo sa formalnim obrazovanjem. Cinjenica je da se svijet jako brzo krece i da mi moramo uciti non stop da bi bili u toku. Najvaznija stvar je ulaganje u samog sebe, i ne treba ti nikakva diploma da bi dokazala tvoj nivo znanja na bilo koju temu (doduse ne odmaze :slight_smile:). Tvoje znanje ce ti sluziti u svakoj situaciji i nikad nije kasno nauciti nesto novo.\nNaravno, u zemlji u kojoj se toliko cesto vise cijeni uvlacenje u dupe ili beskicmenjaci i ljudi koji nemaju znanje je puno teze unovciti to znanje. Doduse to ne znaci da je nemoguce, a i postoje mnoge stvari koje se danas mogu raditi preko interneta. Moze se raditi za ljude iz cijelog svijeta, a sa razvijanjem virtualne stvarnosti ce takva vrsta zaposlenja biti sve cesca i cesca (to je blize nego sto mislis).\n\nIma dana kad nemam snage i kad se samo izlezavam.

The issue I see is that these (my and your examples too) fall more in the category civil society: it's based on organisations doing community mobilisations, intermediating between citizens and farmers, and this rests on subsidies, public or private - even though there was the lucrative advantage for the farmers whose income depended on this group of consumers.\n\nBut still, this goes to tell that the civil society and public funding play a key role.\n\nWhere do you see opportunities for more economical benefits in your examples, if you think about entire rural communities being able to make a living out of their valuable work, caring for the environment and so on?", "created_at": "2020-11-12 06:21:57.801513", "updated_at": "2020-11-12 12:01:55.842825", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 198, "wiki": false, "reads": 26, "score": 65.2, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [86705], "is_liked_by": [8, 3310, 6796], "is_private": false}, {"id": 85193, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 14460, "post_number": 83, "raw": "Hello @moe, did you get the link in the end?\n\nThe event just concluded.

When she does that, such as on this topic, it counts as an edit of the first post (you can click on \"1 :pencil2:\"  in the top right of the first post to see the edit history, it says \"tags changed: \u2026\").\n4. When a post is edited, Discourse re-evaluates the @mentions contained in it, and you get a notification about it.

Set a goal and commit to not using your device more than a set number of minutes or situations per day.\n3. Turn off notifications for everything that is not vital. This is part of the behaviour change technique of removing prompts and triggers.\n4. Make plans for what you can do instead of using your device as the go to source of entertainment/boredom killer.\n5. Allow yourself to fail, we are habitual in our use of our devices, so not perfectly behaving in the way we set out to is completely understandable.

They are informed by my take on history, specifically European and  British history, and are more about the  people who lived the history than the people who aspired to make it. The first trilogy was set at a time roughly equivalent to the Roman occupation of Britain.  I have just completed the second, two-volume story, set a lot later in the fictional history, at a time vaguely equivalent to the 20th century. It is as much political fantasy as it is 'science fantasy' and explores many ideas and preconceptions that created the culture and economy we currently live in.  It's just a story, and I'm neither a qualified historian nor an economist, but writing it certainly gave me some insights into how we got to where we are and what the story of the Fair Land could be.  I don't know if this is of any interest to anyone in this forum. The two new works are at the publishers and should be available in the next month or so.", "created_at": "2020-10-16 13:21:38.324962", "updated_at": "2020-10-16 13:21:38.324962", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 221, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 28.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 77207, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 13615, "post_number": 1, "raw": "**1 .

Anything else that runs into the rate limit most probably indicates that a more specialized custom API is needed \u2013 one that will just return the content for final human consumption and not a larger amount of intermediate content / data.\n\nAs a simplistic example, in Discourse itself the category overview lists contain post counts per topic.

A fully localized mesh could be built up as a hub for all kinds of creativity that has a distinctly local flavor in a way that often the internet isn't optimized for (even though of course localized communities exist there, too). \n\nFor a fictional, but really cool exploration of this I'd highly recommend the (still brand new) debut novel by Tim Maughan, Infinite Detail ([Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121978-infinite-detail)). Set in a kind of post-crash world without internet, there's a community there that uses a local mesh as the foundation for all kinds of local creative sharing from music to augmented reality installations in public space, out on the street. \n\nNot exactly what you're looking for, but I figured it might be close enough to your research interest that it might be worth taking a quick look there.\n\nThat said, the notion of more resilient networking is a tempting one, even outside of purely military use - say in conflict/post-conflict or disaster settings (war zones, earthquakes, etc.), or even just in very remote locations where local file sharing can be really useful among (concurrent or time-shifted) visitors.", "created_at": "2019-05-10 12:17:19.727114", "updated_at": "2019-05-10 12:17:19.727114", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 234, "wiki": false, "reads": 28, "score": 50.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 5083], "is_private": false}, {"id": 650, "user_id": 26, "topic_id": 617, "post_number": 1, "raw": "What is care? To start with such a question a lot comes to mind. Especially after this intense first day of our project kick-off at Sauen, with all these great thoughts, ideas and reflections about what it means to be a human being. I am personally fascinated by the cognitive dissonance I find myself stuck in. This applies to so many aspects of my life. Yes, talking is easy, acting takes effort. It's the same with design, having a nice idea over a glass of wine in the evening? No big deal. But bringing it into life, really doing it and going against all obstacles is a totally different thing. It needs energy, dedication, belief, trust, confidence, help. You need to CARE about it enough to put it into action. So that's one aspect of care. That something/someone has enough value or meaning for somebody to be considered with putting real physical action into it. Usually this is the fact when we are affected personally. When it's a personal thing. When we are involved. When we are touched. When we are concerned.\n\nThe expression \"taking care of something\" as a German is a rather rational, dry and goal-oriented task. It somehow misses the core of its literal meaning which is a soft, emotional and gentle interaction. So how do we define this word? How does the culture we live in put it into action? How is it valued, honored? Who should we care for, what should we take care of and most importantly: what is so dear to us that we want to take care of it? Are we being taken care of enough to give something back? We discussed the question of how can something seemingly burden full turn into a joyful engagement. How can we overcome this cognitive dissonance and what is that undefined obstacle that holds us \u200bback. Because it's not laziness. It's not carelessness. Maybe it's a combination of helplessness (of where to start, what to focus), being overwhelmed (by one's own life and tasks) and alone (with an ambition too big for one person).

On this I have to disagree with <a href=\"https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/acupuncture-doesnt-work/\">Steven Novella</a>. He says:\u00a0\"All good doctors\u00a0are empathetic and patient-centered.\" And this is true, but it misses the point. Because most doctors work in <em>systems</em> which are not humane at all \u2013 and can't be, because they run on an industrial age paradigm. They derive efficiency from scale and standardization, and that requires patients are treated as production batches in manufacturing. Many doctors absolutely hate this, but it's the only game in town. Acupuncture is out of this system, and therefore it can afford to at least try to be humane.</li>\n\n<li>\u00a0Collective treatment and destigmatization.

Take a population of identical firms (or individuals, or financial assets); at each time period, let each of them grow by a rate of growth (of size for firms; wealth for individual; principal in financial assets) randomly drawn from the *same* normal distribution. As you let the model run, the distribution of size, or wealth, or principal approaches a log-normal distribution. A log-normal is *very* unequal, despite the fact that you started from identical individuals and made them grow according to the identical law of motion. Inequality is purely an artifact of randomness.

As far as i understood, the ground for this type of studies goes back to a critical approach of technology (check for instance\u00a0 <a href=\"http://innovate.ucsb.edu/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Winner-Do-Artifacts-Have-Politics-1980.pdf\">Langdon Winner's \"Do Artifacts Have Politics?\"</a> or <a href=\"https://www.sfu.ca/~andrewf/books/critbio.pdf\">Andrew Feenberg's \"Overview on Critical Theory of Technology\" </a>). So it's about \"mobilization\" and \"commons\" what we chose and OP3NCARE might be a case study easily included in the track by these two concepts.\n\nI consider the open, scattered collective design and negotiation experience among the team and the participants in a emerging and growing environment. I agree with @Ezio_Manzini avoiding Latour's instauration as it turns openness and distributive practices to obliged passage points and enrolment that might work on a semiotic level, but it misses the goal of describing how we make experiences about and by the web and re-shape social practices (like design) and in this case the processes of caring. So the question could be: how do we mobilize to obtain a change of the processes of caring thanks to the web and why fostering open practices (commons) it can make the difference.\n\nI'm glad we will meet in Rome on the 3rd to talk and have some progresses together on it.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-01-26 10:49:08", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:01.186606", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 354, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 76554, "user_id": 6466, "topic_id": 13542, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Oto my: mama, tata i synek.

When we \u2018get it right\u2019, I\u2019ve observed how these factors add another dimension to our work within GalGael. Also, when we \u2018get them wrong\u2019 it\u2019s noticeable and often equally revealing. Language in particular has played a role in; \n\n- infusing our decisions and actions with shared values;\n- hardwiring \u2018power-with\u2019 throughout our structures and processes;\n- ensuring connection and understanding;\n- defining collective identity and creating spaces where new personal stories are sculpted.\n\nAs we entered our twentieth year it seemed imperative not to take these and other implicit factors for granted. We initiated a year-long collaborative process to gather up the stories that define \u2018us\u2019 and sift through them for what really matters - the DNA that makes us an \u2018us\u2019. The process produced a document we call our Charter - a document that seemed more necessary than our strategic plan that had lapsed. Past plans, while producing much that was useful, were perhaps like policies rather inadequate at capturing some of the complexity required to engage with issues at the level of systems. Also the \u2018intangibles\u2019 that made us GalGael were somehow missing. The Charter\u2019s words and carefully teased out passages attempt to define our culture - one that creates the conditions for health and self realisation.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/adab68704888c10fb988bea7d7a06b4098d0001d.JPG\" width=\"690\" height=\"387\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/ad54897604f824b5c1f485c508da241a6be594cc.JPG\" width=\"517\" height=\"690\">\n\nThe process involved a range of tools - paper based and online but also round the kitchen table, round camp fires, sifting through boxes of photos and clippings, scribbled on blocks of wood and stacked high or luggage labels - destined for some imagined future. A wall became our collective thinking space. Things were written up and torn down, scored out and underlined - constantly shifting as our thoughts took form. We now have a clear articulation of our values and working principles. They set out how we work together and recognise that sometimes that\u2019s a bit of a stretch. They are also the non-negotiables that mark out our collective territory - the \u2018terms of engagement\u2019. These two sections are perhaps a little like Edgeryders [Protocol](https://edgeryders.eu/t/protocol-0-1-engineering-human-to-human-interaction-for-working-together/4748) and it\u2019s interesting to notice that two of the Protocol\u2019s \u2018algorithms\u2019 relate to use of language and the assumptions beneath these; \u201c01. Be open, also in the way you think of \u2018open\u2019. 02. Never use rhetoric on your brethren.\u201d.\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f573dff68a9d0fe8c34fd314d7f35762db7f6b12.png\" width=\"332\" height=\"288\"> <img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9583e216b75c0a0213af05a2389f09718e9a8234.png\" width=\"341\" height=\"350\">\nA key juncture of the Charter process was hammering out our shared assumptions. Up until then, many of the sources of friction could be traced back to different interpretations of the context our work was responding to. Below is an excerpt:\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7017f629398ed6ced077978b46528c6845a33697.png\" width=\"529\" height=\"336\">\n\nFor example, different interpretations would arise depending on whether you saw drug addiction simply as a \u2018brain disorder\u2019 or your perspective was informed by Bruce Alexander\u2019s work on the \u2018globalisation of addiction\u2019 which points to addiction being a social issue arising from societal fragmentation and our surrounding environment.\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/af84f9420e4aba2fb639a2495a56af1fd9257ee0.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"225\">\n\nOther work has influenced the explicit assumptions we\u2019ve defined. The World Health Organisation's social determinants of health - borne out in research I\u2019ve previously referenced on the Glasgow effect and excess morbidity, researched links between sense of hopelessness, the role of chronic stress & cortisol levels. Collectively, they have contributed to a perspective where we no longer see issues such as addiction, homelessness or depression as a dysfunction of the individual. Rather they are adaptions of functional individuals to dysfunctional systems operating within wider society. It\u2019s not your illness \u2013 it is ours. It is not your affliction - it is your humanity adapting to inhumanity of a world where our tools increasingly produce disutility. \n\nA quote from Krishnamurti captures this best; \u201c_It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society._\u201d\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/c/cec75770382a11f5bb740c2defaeeade2304a46d.jpg\" width=\"204\" height=\"207\">\n\nWithin GalGael, language also helps to define relationships and identity. When you are no longer a \u2018service user\u2019 or a \u2018patient\u2019 it\u2019s easier to counteract the tendency people have to self-identify with the \u2018issue\u2019 they present with. We hear it in the way people describe themselves \u2013 rather than experiencing addiction they are an addict, rather than experiencing depression they are depressed - a strong sense of ownership pervades their descriptions. \n\nThere\u2019s deep injustice in these self-limiting narratives. Mechanisms that build our identity are critical to counter the attachment that we can develop to these \u2018wounds\u2019. Mechanisms such as work, purpose and belonging are important as are our personal and societal narratives - re-writing old, limiting stories perpetuating core beliefs that no longer serve humanity.\n\n**Health as Commodity**\nI was once at a local strategic meeting of organisations planning for the roll out of a government employability programme. The programme was targeted at people with complex barriers, many of those health related. A number of times the phrase \u2018stock in the system\u2019 was used. Towards the end of the meeting, I was horrified to realise that they were talking about people - specifically unemployed people who fitted the programme criteria. This is a striking example of how severely the language of capital and business has polluted our thinking and in a way that can profoundly dehumanise others. It shapes relationships built around transaction - you sell me your poverty, your ill-health, your unemployed status so I can sell my labour to agencies and organisations who sell \u2018positive outcomes\u2019 to well-intentioned programmes, sadly usually funded by the EU and governments.  \n\nWhile this example is glaringly obvious - there are other more insidious uses of language that contribute to a pervasive degradation of the enabling conditions for health. Think of the words; intervention, procedure, treatment. Do they conjure up a sense of care as you read them? They are perhaps another indication of the way in which our healthcare systems are organised around the fundamental assumption that health is a **commodity** - a neat output \u2018produced\u2019 by treatments and policies of our grandest design. We organise our resources and our technology around symptoms, harm reduction, and illness, over-dispensing pharmaceuticals, mostly once the damage is already done. Our healthcare systems have grown ever more sophisticated - technological advancements are impressive - but in that advancement have they sufficiently challenged the fundamental assumptions on which they are is based - considering the question of what generates health over how we simply treat disease? Antonovsky\u2019s work on salutogenesis is little more than a seven-syllable word in academic papers. Twenty nine questions measure his sense of coherence so we can benchmark data internationally but where are the indications that this is having an impact at the system level? Technological advancement continues - as it should - but to what end?\n\nWe are yet an industrial society perpetually organising ourselves around commodities and pseudo commodities such as data and knowledge. Our health and social care systems are increasingly pulled into this orbit but perhaps also struggling to respond to the sickness inherent in the system. The unintended outcome is the kind of codependent relationships that bind up our welfare systems in vicious spirals of impotent consumption and dependency. Open-source approaches have a role to play in de-commodifying our world, something that desperately needs to happen in sphere of care. \n\n**Economies of Care**\nThe author Tim Jackson some time ago advocated a low-productivity economy in an[ article in the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/27/opinion/sunday/lets-be-less-productive.html). \u201c_At first, this may sound crazy; we\u2019ve become so conditioned by the language of efficiency_\u201d. He argued excessive productivity made no sense in the caring professions where time and attention were called for; \u201c_The care and concern of one human being for another is a peculiar \u201ccommodity.\u201d It can\u2019t be stockpiled. It becomes degraded through trade. It isn\u2019t delivered by machines. Its quality rests entirely on the attention paid by one person to another._\u201d. This for me is where care starts to raise issues that I\u2019d refer to as the politics of time, perhaps the subject for another post?\n\nIn _Right to Useful Unemployment_, Illich describes three illusions which turn citizens into \u201ca client to be saved by experts\u201d;\n\n* congestion versus paralysis\n* industrial versus convivial tools; and \n* liberties versus rights. \n\nAll three illusions bear some relevance to the considerations of Open Care. In the first, he defines a \u2018radical monopoly\u2019, referenced in previous posts, that \u201cparalyses autonomous action in favour of professional deliveries\u201d. In the second, Illich argues that we should reserve the term \u2018technical progress\u2019 for new tools that \u201cexpand the capacity and effectiveness of a wider range of people, especially when new tools permit more autonomous production of use-values\u201d. Open source, makerspaces and small-scale fabrication approaches to care, embedded in the community will achieve just this. Perhaps the third illusion is the most interesting. Here he makes an interesting case that rights simply protect access to commodities and are not to be confused with liberties. He argues that health encompasses both rights and liberties. \u201cIt designates the area of autonomy within which a person exercises control over his own biological states and over the conditions of his immediate environment. Simply stated, health is identical with the degree of lived freedom.\u201d Illich suggests that it\u2019s important to distinguish between the two - \u201crights give meaning and reality to equality, while liberties give possibility and shape to freedom. One certain way to extinguish the freedoms to speak, to learn, to heal or to care is to delimit them by transmogrifying civil rights into civil duties.\u201d - ideas I\u2019d like to give more thought to, especially in relation to the reconfiguring the role of citizen in relation to the role of state.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/2/23bb7da419c1fb02a7f42fe2ecbec4140801a773.jpg\" width=\"338\" height=\"345\">\n\n**Ecologies of Care:** organising society around health\n\nI\u2019d like to close this post by sharing a sense that we are entering or have entered an era of convergence and integration. By which I mean that the Industrial Revolution brought many advancements and improvements to standards of living. However, it also ushered in the atomisation of human society and cancerous forms of growth - language reveals the profound levels of disconnection and cognitive dissonance. As our modern capitalist economies emerged, life was organised around commodities and was achieved by a radical segregation of human life. Human labour was bought and sold - separating use-value from producer, labour was broken down into meaningless units of time - the maker separated from the whole process and so the end product of their labour, stripped of the dignity of their craft and of their tools. Work - an activity that used to be more closely integrated with the home - was extracted from communities and moved wholesale into factories and industrial parks. Employment monopolised all other forms of work. Education and health also became exiled to their respective silos of school and hospital, removed from the heart of communities just as older people, our elders, were evicted from family homes and communities to institutionalised forms of care. In the process we created the \u2018profoundly sick society\u2019 Krishnamurti references.\n\nThere are some indications that the main forms of organising life; work, home, school, hospital are converging and have the potential to generate greater sense of meaning, purpose and wellbeing through the reintegration of these spheres of life. The workplace stands to be re-conceptualised around meeting a much broader spectrum of our needs. New forms are emerging; home and remote working, open source technology, revived notions of the commons, small scale manufacturing that have the potential to re-organise our existence not around commodities but around health and self realisation. All forms that have the potential to return use-values to the makers and producers, return us to ourselves and each other - demand less separation between our professional and personal selves, our inner and outer lives and integrate our rights with our liberties. These forms would no longer depend on economies of scale but would favour localism and lend themselves to the 'networks of small groups' that Rich Bartlett of Loomio suggests in [this article](http://organizationunbound.org/expressive-change/build-a-network-of-small-groups-not-a-mass-movement-of-individuals/) would be more effective than a mass movement in bringing about societal change at scale.  \n\n\"_An increasing mass of people agree that long term human survival depends on us replacing the status quo with a fundamentally different set of behaviours and structures. I believe the root of that challenge is essentially cultural, and the best place to grow culture is in small groups._.\" The last sentence stands out for me - linking back to one of my original \u2018research\u2019 strands on the role of culture vs. policy. The Charter does a little to set out GalGael's culture \u2013 not in the hand-me-down business terminology of a strategic plan but in our own language and our own poetry, so that our workshop and places like it, are no longer just countercultural liminal spaces on the edges of society but prototypes for different ways of being in society, prototypes for new forms of organising life not around commodities but around health and solidarity.

I would put it a bit differently - it has not been 'becoming' evidence-based in the sense of people changing how they practice. It is more a case of practitioners, who have ample experience of the effectiveness of the treatments in their own practices, looking to find ways to produce acceptable evidence to back this up so it will be more widely accepted by the mainstream.\n\nAs with all physical interventions, this is not easy! You can't really run a double-blind control study on a physical therapy where the patient can feel whether it's being done or not, and a lot of the resistance to accepting acupuncture involves either rejecting all the 'lesser' forms of evidence for its effectiveness, or designing 'sham' studies that don't really take into account how acupuncture works.\n\nAll that said, there is still a lot of evidence for its effectiveness for a variety of conditions. The Acupuncture Now Foundation have an accessible summary here: https://acupuncturenowfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ANFwhitepaper2016.pdf\n\nOr you can look at their research page - https://acupuncturenowfoundation.org/doctors/studies/ - or at the factsheets on the BAcC website: http://www.acupuncture.org.uk/category/a-to-z-of-conditions/a-to-z-of-conditions.html\n\nI have Chinese colleagues who like to point out that this is just the tip of the iceberg - there are literally thousands of positive studies from China [and Japan, and Taiwan, and South Korea, if you're worried about the quality of communist science] that have never been translated into English...\n\nI don't have any evidence of the effectiveness of my own treatments specifically, though! I can't afford to hire a medical research team, so I'm reliant on the already-existing body of evidence and theory. :)\n\n", "created_at": "2016-08-22 19:44:17", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:48.511981", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 353, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [19386], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8632, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 684, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Building a community of users &amp; contributors </b>\n\nPing @Woodbinehealth, I think you guys should have a look at this.\n\nOne of the challenges of alternative care provision is evolving tools that enable it around the needs of communities that use them, and support those who develop them. I had a conversation with Amir Hannan, a GP working in the UK, about how  chronic care requires patients to self-manage for good health outcomes (writeup coming soon). Over 15 years he has built a practice based website to encourage an support his patents gain a better understanding of their health to better enable automy and self-care. You can see the site itself here: www.htmc.co.uk (especially the \"<a href=\"http://www.htmc.co.uk/pages/pv.asp?p=htmc176\">Common Problems you can solve yourself section</a> - see menu on the left)\"...\n\nAfter reading both <a href=\"/t/id/7566\">this post</a> and @maymay above I started thinking about something that maybe we could build into the OPENandChange process.\n\nWhat if the health resource centre you are building could have a distributed presence (and network of contributors) as a compliment to the physical space itself? And how could a community support the developers working on it?\n\nI think cracking this could unlock a lot of community knowledge and support, as well as free up resources for providing health and soccial care services to a currently underserved individuals/ communities. Plus it could care for the (far too few) people with deep tech skills that are dedicating themselves to building tools contributing towards fixing the kinds of community resilience challenges we are attempting to tackle...\n\nAnother member of the community who might be interested in this is @Eireann_Leverett who does information security and has experience with tech-related privacy/security issues which is a concern.

They are added onto topics, which in turn are part of categories. In Edgeryders we are very action-oriented, so lively discussions tend to lead to \"why don't we do X?\". When a discussion becomes large, it receives its own category, and that's when you see these \"blossomings\". \n\n[quote=\"amelia, post:15, topic:13751\"]\nAs for those projects themselves, are there moments where they solidify or increase more dramatically, and is it possible to understand why or how?\n[/quote]\n\nThat's the holy grail, is it not? I guess we would need to start with smaller viz of individual projects ([example](/t/13732)), and make hypotheses: \"We had a successful event in Warsaw in September, we should visually detect a \"blossoming\" of the conversation tree between August and October... look, there it is!\". Dataviz: telling stories with the data. \n\nFor you personally. @amelia, and the mighty @leonie and @ccs: we should be thinking about ways to use Gource to represent coding. This is not intuitive at all, for reasons connected to the high specificity of Gource. But for example, we could represent annotating as an edit to a node (supported in Gource: it shows a different-colored \"laser beam\"). To keep a visual record of the annotated node, we could create a second node representing the annotation, and assign to it a different color (this, would show also an extra green laser beam. Oh well.). In the end, the conversation graph would be a set of (say) green beads representing posts, interspersed by (say) blue ones representing annotations. \n\nAnother possibility is to represent annotations and codes as separate root branches. Instantiate codes as if they were topics; and annotations as if they were posts. Visually, you should see if some codes occur a lot (many annotations-nodes clustered around the same code-node). The main constraint is this: Gource can only deal with acyclical graphs (trees). So, we cannot watch the code-code network (or the social network) form in real time.\n\n[quote=\"amelia, post:15, topic:13751\"]\nAll these people coming together and creating stuff.\n[/quote]\n\nYeah, it's beautiful. :slight_smile:", "created_at": "2020-06-05 09:12:14.086342", "updated_at": "2020-06-05 09:17:13.636167", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 423, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 29.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [78281], "is_reply_to": [78281], "is_liked_by": [6677], "is_private": false}, {"id": 40399, "user_id": 3622, "topic_id": 7853, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/abff26d8c8f76be0a3a7c7c7eb53fdfe2cc9e208.png\" width=\"500px\" height=\"auto\" align=\"middle\" style=\"margin: 0px auto; margin-right: 30px;\">\n\n\n----------\n\n**Attending** \n\n@hazem, @unknown_author, @mahmoud, @owen\n\n**Summary** \n\nThis week we had an interesting discussion about developing a new media platform exploring how storytelling can amplify citizen journalism and activism, how to bring very local stories to a global audience, and filmmaking combined with digital nomadism. \n\n**Discussion** \n\n@unknown_author brings up the idea of a platform to create stories that revolve around building a sustainable future, as discussed recently [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/edgeryders-and-the-dilemma-of-storytelling/7835/5), a new media platform where people can get help publishing new stories using a process that creates value for a community, similar to what is already happening on Edgeryders but with a focus on creative storytelling.\n\n@owen - currently working on a distributed tv platform that could be combined with the above idea. The platform's premise is to make it easy to build TV channels based in different locations around the world - sort of ambient location based TV. First plan is to set up in Exarchia, Athens. Will be using an open Wi-Fi mesh network in Exarchia that already exists, anyone using the network in the area can upload content to the channel. So a highly localised TV channel, viewable to anyone in the world. Something that could also easily be deployed in Essaouira, for example.\n\n@unknown_author - expands on this with his experience with independent radio networks, and how this could be useful in bringing very local cultures that are essentially disconnected from the online world - and find unique stories from these places that can be shared. \n\n@hazem - mentions the opportunity to produce original content in Essaouira and other locations around Morocco. Excited about the idea, has a list of potential locations to visit. Believes that many locations are undervalued by marketing/tourism efforts that are misaligned with the realities of a place - usually far more interesting than the way in which they are presented to visitors.\n\n@mahmoud joins from Jordan, where he is currently working in online media, with [aramram.com](aramram.com) - a web TV platform producing regional content in Arabic in the Middle East. Excited about new storytelling ideas - media initiatives including in Amman, where the target is to build an alternative image of a city or place that is not touristic but real. Also interested in how this fits with digital nomadism, exploring ways to live and work remotely in the fields of graphic design, programming, filmmaking and photography.\n\n@owen - thoughts on how filmmaking is evolving to become more and more (already is) a nomadic creative form, not only in a technical sense, where locations are improvised and shooting is free form, but also in how the story arc encompasses multiple perspectives, influenced by an ever changing context and the people who exist in them. call it 'agile storytelling' - a form that absorbs the stories and characters of the immediate environment, rather than sets out with a predetermined script.\n\n@mahmoud - expands on the nomadic + storytelling theme talking about [spicyroad.org](spicyroad.org) - with the mission of \"Hitchhiking for feminism and refugee support\", collecting recipes along the way and documenting with video and photography. Started in Berlin and ended up in SE Asia - the journey they took can be seen on a map, with documented entries on every stop of the way. More of a generic platform [Tripline](http://tripline.net/), allows you to map your stories in a similar fashion.\n\n@owen - the idea of embeddable maps, or context aware (unobtrusive) information overlays, while you watch a video, with a link to an article or someone's entry on the Edgeryders platform, sounds pretty cool and an interesting use of mixed media. Combining maps with video also plays into the theme of storytelling and nomadism.\n\n@hazem proposes a centralised wiki to outline the idea, production plan, stories to tell, logistics involved (travel, equipment). What it needs will be planning, clarity and ideas for stories. How much of it will rely on online discussion, how much will be searching for something unknown out in the field - remains to be seen. \n\nWhat is clear is that we all see a great opportunity to start working on something soon, and the Essaouira retreat seems to be a likely fit.\n\ncc / @nadia @noemi @anique.yael @nabeel_p @alberto", "created_at": "2017-12-15 15:57:10.989525", "updated_at": "2018-03-21 12:29:42.033215", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 728, "wiki": false, "reads": 37, "score": 319.4, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 4, 1935, 3904, 3811, 4196], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6927, "user_id": 1612, "topic_id": 2922, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>VA Course Proposal</b>\n\nI had proposed a Viral Academy Course, (with tentative name, \"<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KoXepIxj0Q-cturrlrA3FAZffP3KdymqVIzMHomCLyI/edit\">Agile Studios</a>\") to teach pre/post media production and strategy to multiple mediums and spaces.\u00a0\n\n<blockquote class=\"content-citation\" style=\"\">\n\nAs I have been a part of first VA batch, formed during the LOTE 3 at Matera, I have been learning (coding, animation and opensource culture) and teaching (Multimedia Production, Event Management and Lean/Agile Start-ups).\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote class=\"content-citation\" style=\"\">\n\nNow I am in Matera since four days, during which Ive been getting on par with on-going Viral Academy Structure Development and Market Research for Students skills supply/demand.

Introduction</h2>\n\nDiscourse themes are the simplest way of customizing the look & feel of a Discourse platform. You will get exposed to them as (1) a moderator or admin wanting to change how something looks, to change a main menu entry or to do something special (like hiding an element) and (2) as a client with an Edgeryders \"whitelabel solution\" on an own domain, wanting to set up your very own design.\n\nThere are two types of Discourse themes: normal themes (just \"themes\", here also \"local themes\") and remote themes. Normal themes live as settings in the Discourse database, while remote themes live as files in a git repository and can be automatically fetched and updated from there by Discourse. In the first use case from above, you mostly work on a normal theme, in the second one exclusively with a remote theme.\n\nIn both cases, it is relevant to know that a theme is a relatively limited way to customize Discourse. In technical terms, the only thing a theme can do is overwrite and add to the CSS and HTML code of the \"one and only\" internal Discourse theme. This internal Discourse theme is invisible to admins, you can only see it in the actual source code.\n\nAlso note that the two pre-installed, local themes that come with every Discourse installation (\"Default\" and \"Dark\") do just the same: adding to and overwriting CSS and HTML of the internal Discourse theme. They are nothing special, and they can even be deleted. \"Default\" is actually a local theme that adds _nothing_ to the internal Discourse theme (before you edited it \u2026), and \"Dark\" is one that only modifies the color scheme (using \"Simple Dark\").\n\nThere is, so far, no official way to \"start a theme from scratch\", or to modify the internal Discourse theme, except by editing the Discourse core source code. Plugins can do some of that, and handlebars templates can also do some of that. Fortunately, handlebars templates can be included into any Discourse theme ([example](https://github.com/SamSaffron/discourse-simple-theme/blob/master/desktop/header.html), [instructions](https://meta.discourse.org/t/41281)).\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2. Creating and editing a Discourse local theme</h2>\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-1\">2.1. How to add an asset to the Discourse local theme</h3>\n\nThis documents how to add images and files for use in the Discourse template / theme.\n\nThe difficulty is that all uploaded files need to be referenced in a topic for Discourse to consider them \"in use\" \u2013 otherwise, Discourse might delete them after a time to save space. So this topic also serves to reference all these assets \u2013 means: **Do not delete this topic, it stores the theme graphics!** To protect this topic against unauthorized changes, post your assets in comments here and do _not_ make these comments into wikis \u2013 then, only staff members can edit them.\n\n1. Create a new reply to this topic.\n\n2. In your reply, upload the image you wish to use for a logo, favicon or other website asset. (Use the upload toolbar icon in the post editor, or drag-and-drop or paste images.)\n\n3. Submit your reply to post it.\n\n4. Right click the image in your new post to get the path to the uploaded image, or click the edit icon to edit your post and retrieve the path to the image. Copy that image path.\n\n5. Paste this image path into the corresponding [URL field for a required website asset](/admin/site_settings/category/required?filter=url), or a similar URL field somewhere else in the Discourse settings.\n\nIf you need to enable different file type uploads, edit `authorized_extensions` in the [file settings](/admin/site_settings/category/files).\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--3\">3. Creating and editing a Discourse remote theme</h2>\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-1\">3.1. What is a Discourse remote theme, what can it do?</h3>\n\nDiscourse remote themes are a better / more structured way to share the look & feel customizations that can be made in the Discourse admin interface at \"Admin \u2192 Customize \u2192 Themes\" and \"Admin \u2192 Customize \u2192 Colors\". These settings could already be exported into a `*.dcstyle.json` file each, but these files were not properly editable as a file, and thus not properly manageable with a version control system for collaborative development.\n\nDiscourse remte themes provide _exactly_ the customization options known from \"Admin \u2192 Customize \u2192 Themes\" and \"Admin \u2192 Customize \u2192 Colors\" in the Discourse admin backend, and nothing more.\n\nFor all this, see the official [Discourse how-to for remote themes](https://meta.discourse.org/t/60848), and esp. [this comment](https://meta.discourse.org/t/60848/8) there.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-2\">3.2. File structure</h3>\n\nThe following files of a Discourse remote theme will be evaluated, if present [[source](https://meta.discourse.org/t/60848)].  Only `about.json` is required, the others are optional and correspond to the different form fields when editing a theme under \"Admin \u2192 Customize \u2192 Themes\".\n\n    about.json\n   \n    common/common.scss\n    common/header.html\n    common/after_header.html\n    common/footer.html\n    common/head_tag.html\n    common/body_tag.html\n    common/embedded.scss\n    \n    desktop/desktop.scss\n    desktop/header.html\n    desktop/after_header.html\n    desktop/footer.html\n    desktop/head_tag.html\n    desktop/body_tag.html\n    \n    mobile/mobile.scss\n    mobile/header.html\n    mobile/after_header.html\n    mobile/footer.html\n    mobile/head_tag.html\n    mobile/body_tag.html\n\nIn addition to these files, all files referenced in the `about.json` file as theme assets are also evaluated [[source](https://meta.discourse.org/t/62462)].\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-3\">3.3. Format of about.json</h3>\n\nYou can see an example with all the possible options in the specification code:\n\nhttps://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/spec/models/remote_theme_spec.rb#L24\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--4\">4. Enabling your custom Discourse theme</h2>\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-1\">4.1. Making the theme user selectable</h3>\n\nThis is the simplest version. It's a setting for that theme in the admin backend. This setting is not imported and exported in `.dcstyle.json` files, and also cannot be contained in remote themes, probably for security reasons.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-2\">4.2. Overriding the default theme with custom code</h3>\n\nThis technique requires changes to Discourse core code. As a result, you can set the default theme however you want, including dependent on the domain a user is currently using to view your Discourse (multisite) installation.\n\nFor that last case, the simplest alternative is to evaluate the standard \"Host:\" HTTP Request Header field, telling you the domain the visitor is on. This field is not normally supplied to Discourse as it usually sits behind a reverse proxy. However, you can enable it. In case you use Apache 2, add this option to your virtual host configuration section:\n\n    ProxyPreserveHost On\n\nHow to make the required code changes in Discourse: _[TODO]_\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-3\">4.3. Overriding theme_key</h3>\n\nThis allows you to choose a default theme for all users. It is useful in cases where you cannot simply use the \"Theme is enabled by default\" option in the theme settings in Discourse, for example when you have a secondary domain that should show (parts of) your Discourse installation but with a different default theme.\n\n1. **Make the theme user selectable.** It will work only then, as the mechanism is imitating a user action for theme selection by setting the relevant cookie.\n\n2. **Look up the theme key.** \n\n    1. Go to \"Account preferences \u2192 Interface\" of your own Discourse account, choose the theme of which you want to know the `theme_key` in the dropdown and disable (!) the \"Make this my default theme on all my devices\" checkbox. Theme choice by cookie is only done on a per-device basis, while theme choice for all devices is simply saved to a user's account.\n\n    2. Open the web developer tools of your browser and look up the value of the `theme_key` cookie. That's the theme's key.\n\n3. **Set theme_key with a cookie.** In your proxy configuration that forwards traffic from your domain to Discourse, configure that a cookie with the theme key is set. In case you use the Apache 2 `mod_proxy` mechanism for proxying, you can use a `mod_rewrite` rule like the following to set the cookie:\n\n        RewriteRule \"^(.*)$\" \"-\" [CO=theme_key:10577b5d-17b2-4030-bf45-7a8654064efe\\%2C6:biofabforum.org:0:/]\n\n    Note how the `%` character is escaped as `\\%`, or it will not work. The meaning of this part `%2C6` of the the theme key is not yet known. This part is not contained in the theme key mentioned in a `.dcstyle.json` file exported by Discourse for the theme, and it does not change when renaming the theme inside Discourse. `%2C` is probably URL encoding for the character `,`.\n\nRemaining issues: \n\n* **Works only for logged-in users, so far.** Code changes to Discourse core are required to fix this, so this is not a nice solution after all.\n\n* **Shows up in the user theme selection form.** Means, in the form at `/u/{username}/preferences/interface`. This means that there is clientside JavaScript code connected to this form that both sets and evaluates this setting based on the `theme_key` cookie. As it shows up as a change the user has done to their form, which they did not, it's confusing and not a nice solution \u2026\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--5\">5. CSS formatting tricks for Discourse</h2>\n\nDiscourse has very (!) limited capabilities for using HTML in the editor. It sanitizes away all `class` and `id` attributes of tags, for example. There are multiple ways to deal with these limitations, as follows:\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--5-1\">5.1. Whitelisting tags and attributes</h3>\n\nhttps://meta.discourse.org/t/24280/25\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--5-2\">5.2. Substituting for CSS selectors for id and class</h3>\n\nThere are cases where you want to CSS format HTML elements not by tag name but by a property that you can influence as user while writing content. Normally you would add a `class` or `id` attribute to the element, but these are sanitized away by Discourse. However, there is a hack around this (and it does not need whitelisting elements): use an `<a name=\"\u2026\"> </a>\" element and the CSS sibling selector.\n\nExample: You want to select the `div` that is the parent of a `table` element (and there are still no parent selectors in CSS \u2026).\n\nYou can use this HTML code:\n\n    <div>\n      <a name=\"table-calendar\"> </a>\n      <div>\n        <table>\u2026</table>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n\nTogether with this SCSS code:\n\n    article .contents .cooked {\n      a[name*=\"table-\"] + div {\n        overflow-y: auto; /* or however you want to format the div */\n      }\n    }\n\nNote that you may have to put the HTML code all in one line to prevent Discourse from editing `<br/>` tags that would break the sibling selector match. Also note, the outer `<div>` element is just to prevent Discourse from putting your `<a>` element into an auto-generated `<p>` element, which would also break the sibling selector match.", "created_at": "2017-06-17 19:58:41.401499", "updated_at": "2019-03-24 11:39:41.658551", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1988, "wiki": true, "reads": 11, "score": 7829.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30917, "user_id": 128, "topic_id": 1712, "post_number": 40, "raw": "<b>Let's gather !</b>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; \">The online platform will stay until the end of the year at least, no worries about that.</div><div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; \">\u00a0</div><div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; \">If we want support from the CoE, we will have to wait until september at least, and i'm not willing to wait for that, so do you and probably others willing to continue sharing and working together.</div><div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; \">\u00a0</div><div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; \">\"And as a first step,\u00a0I imagine a gathering in a less formal setting,</div><div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; \">such as in the middle of nowhere in nature, for a more extended period of time ( 10 days ? )\"</div><div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; \">\u00a0</div><div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; \">It's exactly what i'd love to be part of.</div><div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; \">Being in a place like the council of europe was really distrubing.</div><div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; \">The university place was better, but there was still lack of nature to feed the body and soul.

Here is the English language version: https://edgeryders.eu/t/reorganising-the-provision-of-goods-services-to-secure-material-basis-of-livelihoods-focus-healthcare/13376\n\n**Official project affiliation**: for the events in Polish and German it is Poprebel \n\n\n\n\n# Introduction of the Healthcare and social services theme\n## In English\n\n* What is care for you?\n* Who provides care in your family, your city?\n* Who should take care of aging people? For? Children?\n* How do you think the care in your country looks like? How do you look after others?\n\nCare is a key element of a healthy society. Its quality and availability translate into quality of life - this applies to both health, psychological and social care. Our opportunities to participate in family and public life, access to work, depend on whether in our cities we have doctors and clinics, hospitals and kindergartens, people helping the elderly and disabled in everyday activities, support for poor families or homeless. Meanwhile, health care is limping - queues to specialist doctors, which are inadequate in Poland, last even a year. We spend more than half on the health of the budget for less than half, for example, Germany - and many people can not afford a good doctor or care far from home. Not to mention the chronic shortage of doctors.\n\nMore and more often we notice people demand the necessary changes - which ones do you personally feel are the most urgent?\n\nLittle more is spent on combating homelessness and building social housing. Stories of families and older people being thrown out of privatized houses appear regularly in national media - many of them are offered instead of premises with conditions unworthy of the developed country.\n\nUnder-funded are also pensions, pensions, health care and rehabilitation. For example, the protest of families of disabled people in Poland in the last year showed us the scale of the problem - not only do disabled people not get enough support from the state, insufficient help for their families means that many of them live in poverty and can not work. Many of us support the right to the birth of every child - but few of us are aware of the costs and hardships of providing a decent standard of living for people with disabilities. This is even more paradoxical in the country with the strictest rules in Europe when it comes to the right to abortion.\n\nUnderfunding assistance for older people dumps this obligation on younger generations. Often, they are often lonely, infirm, living alone and living with insufficient pensions. Half of poverty, if they have families, and these families can afford it. Worse with those who live alone, or their relatives, barely connect the end to the end. Additional burdens make it difficult for such families to get out of poverty or to educate their children. Perhaps you know the problem from your own experience, and have ideas that would help you cope with this challenge?\n\nYoung families are directly affected by an insufficient number of kindergartens and cr\u00e8ches - that's why parents do not send their children to them as often as in other European countries. And this affects their professional and financial situation, not to mention educational opportunities for children.\n\nIn addition, money is often spent in an ineffective way, which reduces the chances of poor people to change their life situation. Sweden, Hungary and Luxembourg are much better off here, whose social assistance is three times more likely to help citizens get out of poverty. Do you think that the role of the state is responsible and wise financial management, and help the poor to improve their situation?\n\nWe are curious about your opinion on social and health care in (country). First of all, should it be exercised by the state - and if so, what, in your opinion, would have to be included in it? Do you need solidarity with the poor and the excluded? If so, why?\n\nWe have created a special forum for this need, where we can safely talk about important topics. We will avoid conflicts and insults here, we will provide all participants with the right conditions to express their own opinions and feelings.\n\nThanks to you, we will understand what are the life experiences of the Polish, the Serbs, Czechs, Hungarians, and anyone who has something to say about it.\n\nWe invite you to participate in this discussion.\n\nWelcome to join us for a relaxed virtual chat to meet other participants and learn more about this initiative here: http://bit.ly/2Zf3Id9\n\nWe look forward to meeting you\n\n\n## In Polish\n\nCzym jest dla Ciebie opieka?\n\nKto dostarcza opieki w Twojej rodzinie, Twoim mie\u015bcie?\n\nKto powinien sprawowa\u0107 opiek\u0119 nad starzej\u0105cymi si\u0119 osobami?

How are we building good lives against a backdrop of massive social, economic, political challenges. How are we creating opportunities for ourselves and where can we support one another better? In work, health, family, community life.\n\n### How you, me and everyone we know can participate:\n\n1. [Sign up here! ](http://communities.edgeryders.eu/) to join our community\n2.

Please read it carefully!\n\nWe look forward to meeting you,\n\n### How is this project financed?\nThe conversation is part of a Horizon 2020 funded Research and Innovation Action under the official name POPREBEL. The project focuses on explaining and contextualising the recent rise of populism in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). The community research is hosted on Edgeryders, an online community of 5000 people in more than 80 countries who share experiences. By sharing experiences with one another we turn our collective knowledge into useful advice to make better decisions for ourselves and our families in the near future. As a consequence of getting to know people from around the world, we connect one another to important information, new ideas and new opportunities.\n\nThe research analysis considers content collected through [edgeryders.eu](https://edgeryders.eu/), subject to online ethnographic analysis and semantic social network analysis.\n\nBeyond the research project, we are a community: We use the tools offered by this platform to help connect people with mutual interests, concerns and complimentary skills. The online conversation runs in parallel with events all over Europe to meet and share constructive approaches. Anyone is welcome to participate from and beyond our focus countries (Czech Republic, Poland, Serbia).\n\nThe project is funded by the European Commission under grant agreement number 822682 from 2019-2021.\n\nThis conversation is hosted by Edgeryders, in partnership with University College London (United Kingdom), University Karlova (the Czech Republic), University Jagiellonski (Poland), University of Belgrade (Serbia).\n\n\n## In Polish\n**Znajdujemy w prze\u0142omowym momencie w dziejach historii: obserwujemy zmiany klimatu, ekonomiczne nier\u00f3wno\u015bci, spadaj\u0105ce zaufanie do Unii Europejskiej i warto\u015bci, jakie ona reprezentuje.

In this series of listening sessions and follow up discussions we explore credible paths moving forward based on real life cases, not pie in the sky scenarios.

We will end it with a webinar during which we present the findings, as well as proposals for possible collaborations and partnerships between participating individuals and organisations who have participated in the process.\n\n**On the platform:** Discover, discuss and make sense of [case stories](https://edgeryders.eu/c/knowledge/care-stories). We knew years ago that healtcare systems all over the world were ill positioned to handle a massive crisis. Over 2 years we have been collecting stories of how individuals and groups all over the world are mobilising to care for people where state and market were failing to do so. We now have a huge repository of examples that we can learn from. These are first hand stories by the protagonists themselves - many of whom are on the edgeryders community platform and can be reached to answer questions, provide additional input or possibly even be engaged in new initiatives. The curated collection of summaries will be released on a dedicated blog. \n\n**At the listening session:** We will invite protagonists of some of these initiatives featured in the series of case stories on the platform ahead of the event. In order to ensure a high quality discussion - we expect participants to have read and commented on at least 3 of the featured stories so that we know that people have some common foundation for a meaningful conversation.\n\n**Webinar:** Present the findings.

Some join in, actively listening, asking questions or giving thoughtful responses. (This is a safe place and not for debating opinions or speaking for others.)\n\nThe discussion begins with first hand accounts of attempts taken to solve societal issues and moves to navigating the personal challenges experienced by members. Nuances and the various different contexts surrounding these challenges begins to show.\n\n* A series of listening sessions around key issues.\n* Webinars to present and discuss case studies.\n* Online co-creation workshops to design and plan joint actions.\n* An online hackathon to accelerate existing initiatives through technical support\n\n#### Information analysis & Action\n\nNext open source technology is used to make connections between topics being discussed, the people discussing them, places, projects, solutions and struggles. When we put this together, patterns start to emerge that help join these ideas and people to each other and to other information, skill and resources.\n\nBy the end of the process, our community members have gained a richer knowledge and understanding of the issue they wish to tackle and have a blueprint to put their idea into action.\n\n* Preparation: Collecting and discussing case studies, preparing initiatives for the hackathon, Pre-event introductions and networking\n* During the event: Rigorous documentation, definition of a list of follow up action points with clear allocation of roles and responsibilities, open participatory budgeting for the activities.\n* Follow up: Rapid deployment of the actions (1 week cycles), followed by open participatory evaluation and codesign of next cycle based on lessons learned.\n\n### Format & practical information\n* **A discussion on our online platform followed by meeting.** You tell us a little about yourself and your thoughts on the topic to reserve your slot. Then receive a link and password to the event the day before: [Register here](https://covid19-summit.netlify.app/).\n* **Full information sheet:** add url here *(create a new one for each session using [this template](https://edgeryders.eu/t/listening-session-participant-information-sheet-template/13405))*\n* **Not a panel, an open, moderated discussion** . A moderator will give the floor to people who want to contribute something. Some have already volunteered (see list below, updated continuously). If you want to share your point of view, use the call\u2019s chat to let us know, and the moderator will give you the floor. If you have a question to ask the speaker, ask it in the chat (better) or let us know you want to ask a question. Questions are taken before we move on to the next speaker.\n* **We commit to doing a proper writeup of the result**  (aka \u201cdocumentation, or it didn\u2019t happen\u201d). Edgeryders also deploys its team of ethnographers for participant observation and note-taking.\n* **Everyone welcome** . Below there is a list of the people who have agreed to show up. If you are coming too, we are happy to put you on it. If you prefer not to be on the list, that\u2019s OK too.\n* **Please note we aim to publish the content of the conversation as public knowledge, available to activist and scholars** . However, this will happen through writeups by people in Edgeryders. While we will record the event, participants are welcome to sign up under aliases and keep their video shut off. Also the writeups will not mention any names.\n\n<hr>\n\n\n## Preparation & Follow up\n\n#### Before the listening session  \nDiscover, discuss and make sense of case stories. We (Edgeryders) knew years ago that healthcare systems all over the world were ill positioned to handle a massive crisis. Together with The City of Milan, The University of Bordeaux, the Institute for Economic and Business History Research in Stockholm, WeMake, and the Scimpulse Foundation m research project we ran a project called OpenCare. Over 2 years we interviewed individuals and groups all over the world who are mobilising to care for people where state and market were failing to do so. \n\n<br>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/162811723\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<br>\n<br>\n\nWe now have a huge repository of stories and examples that we can learn from. These are first hand stories by the protagonists themselves - many of whom are on the edgeryders community platform and can be reached to answer questions, provide additional input or possibly even be engaged in new initiatives. The curated collection of summaries will be released on a dedicated blog.\n\n### What happens after the event?\nThis is an open ended journey. What happens depends on what those of us who participate in the process develop together. Edgeryders has a proven track record of initiating and stewarding open processes towards tangible outcomes and opportunities for the participants. We cannot promise specific outcomes, but we can promise it will be generative and interesting.\n\n### How to partner with this event\n\n* This actitvity can be nested within other events/ co-event (own registration from)\n* what we want from partners: Visibility/Reach/Content/Funding\u2026 (Alignment)\n* We are good at the interesting, timely discussions - but struggle to build a good interface with organisations at the centre whose support we need to affect change.\n\nIf you want to help, you have two options\n\n1) If you are an individual: Login to/create an account on edgeryders.eu and [leave a comment here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/sneak-peek-covid19-resilient-livelihoods-an-online-summit/13296).

It is very kind of you to take some time to jump in with new ideas.  \n\n[quote=\"amelia, post:4, topic:14264\"]\nhis is actually *exactly* what we are looking for. Thank you! Being able to give a proximity value for different codes (e.g. how proximately `healthcare` and `funding strain` are when they co-occur) would be very useful in hypothesising the relative meaningfulness of co-occurrences (and interrogating @Jan\u2019s theory about meaningfulness being related to proximity).\n[/quote]\n\nHmm... not sure. Data science hygiene: before you launch into computation, consider your assumptions as to what constitutes \"data\", and why. SSNA as we conceived it is based on this:\n\n> A post is a coherent utterance, and constitutes a unit. Its author wrote it the way she did (and not, for example, break it down into two shorter posts, or reply to some other post in the same thread) for a reason. Therefore, we represent all concepts expressed in the post (as discovered by coding) as associated to one another, or, in network terms, a clique.\n\nThis, in turn, is based on the \"citizen expert\" ideology. People, as a whole, are thinking adults, and we will do them the honor of taking what they say at face value. \n\nA lot of NLP has a very different vision: \n\n> A post is a realization of a \"bag of words\" probability distribution. We discover meaning (\"topic analysis\") by comparing the probability of co-occurrence between words (not codes) in the given text with the frequency of how often those same words co-occur in some large collection of documents, cast as a null model. Important information lives in the word sequence, not in the meaning. \n\nIn such a context, proximity in co-occurrence clearly makes sense. Unfortunately, word-level computational analysis of language is more comfortable with the ideology of the writer as a desiring machine than with that of the citizen expert. Early NLP implementations (\"sentiment analysis\") were used to measure the \"sentiment\" of commercial brands. The implication is that I am going to buy, say, clothes not based on a rational process of comparing competing products, but because I have positive associations with their brand. I would say this is probably more true for consumption, and less for \"republican\" citizen participation. \n\nFinally, note that: \n\n[quote=\"liam, post:5, topic:14264\"]\nBy itself it doesn\u2019t help with the meanings because it doesn\u2019t distinguish between:\n\u201cThe healthcare system in Poland is low quality.\u201d and\n\u201cNo one is claiming that the healthcare system in Poland is low quality.\u201d\n[/quote]\n\nThis is indeed an interesting NLP problem, but even the most inexperienced human coder has no problem distinguishing between those. NLP tools are all optimized for a world where no human is going to read and attribute meaning. We, however, are walking down a different path: \"human-powered alternative to AI\".\n\nBottom line: like @hugi, I see this as a Masters of Networks hackathonic experiment rather than as an OE functionality. We never meant our graphs as self explanatory results, only as \"big picture\" conveyors of meaning. But the analyst still needs to go out and call it. Even as an experiment, we need to make sure we know what we are experimenting, and reflect on whether the experiment is changing our assumptions about how people contribute to a SSNA study.\n\nAlso, how is `low-quality` a legitimate code? It does not mean anything per se. It would be another story if you could mention a cause, or aspect of low quality, like `bureaucratization` or `obsolete infrastructure` or `long waiting times`. And if you did that, you would no longer get the false co-occurrence, because low quality in cars would code for something like `unreliability` or `planned obsolescence`. But if you *did*... then you would have a coincidence, and if you had it three times, as the saying goes, you would have enemy action \u2013 something potentially interesting.", "created_at": "2020-08-23 18:19:05.885591", "updated_at": "2020-08-23 18:19:05.885591", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 660, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 31.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 2, "quotes_posts": [82041, 82068], "is_reply_to": [82041, 82068], "is_liked_by": [3323], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13317, "user_id": 82, "topic_id": 1311, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>mediatization: lets have a pyramid each?</b>\n\nMedia space at the moment leaves no or little space for full spectators.

Bauwens - Burn Out</b>\n\nOne main finding made by field researchers about burn out is that one of the main factors that leads people to burn out is \"ethical suffering\" (litteral translation of the original expression in French \"souffrance \u00e9thique\") and this before workload.\n\nWhat does that mean ? Stress often comes from a conflict of values between prescribed work and \"real\" work, \"real\" in the sense of\u00a0what really has to be done in a correct way.\n\nA large amount of professionals who get burnt out couldn't live anymore with the contradiction between what is asked and what should really be done. And I don't speak about\u00a0ethics from ideological point of view. Just the tension between what is asked and what true professionals believe should be done (eg : social workers in big institutions, engineers in industrial companies, nurses in hospitals,...). The fact that there\u00a0is no place anymore for true\u00a0dialogue,\u00a0exchanges and co-construction around their own practices worsened the situation.\n\nSo bringing \"real' work in the center of the operations\u00a0by giving back the floor to those who act is a way that is currently implemented in a few organizations to significantly reduce the risk of burn out. By organizations, I mean not-for-profit, for-profit or public organizations. None of them is immune to this illness...especially the not-for-profit ones like NGOs.\n\nAnd this is without mentioning the ethical conflicts that workers can have between their own values and those shown withing the organizations they work for. And this is another (big) story.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-08-29 16:28:23", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:24.862491", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 288, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 44353, "user_id": 2095, "topic_id": 284, "post_number": 5, "raw": "@matthias Where did you go to with your idea?

And transcription is a very big deal in ethnography. Researchers are armed with resources like\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.linguistics.ucsb.edu/projects/transcription/A02asymbols.pdf\">this</a>: write (<em>H)</em>\u00a0when the informant \u00a0utters an \"audible inhalation\", (<em>Hx)</em>\u00a0when she utters an \"audible exhalation\". Write\u00a0<em>@ </em>for laughter (\"one per pulse\", so @ @ @) etc. etc.\n\nTrouble with that, there is a tradeoff between transcription accuracy and costs of data, so, ultimately, between transcription accuracy and number of informants that ethnographers can afford to have in a study. Already 10 years ago, in a relatively low-cost (Western) country like Italy, transcriptions cost 100 EUR per hour of recording. My colleagues at UNIMORE tried the time-honored academic move to deploy unpaid students as transcribers, but it did not work. The transcriptions were of too low quality. So, ethnography was always a small-numbers research techniques: 20 informants is a respectable number in a study. In opencare, with 50% of the project done, we have already 202.\u00a0\n\nEthnography in its traditional form will continue to exist. But opencare is trying to repurpose it\u00a0to serve it as a tool for collective intelligence. And collective intelligence needs... collective, i.e. fairly large numbers.\n\nThe professional quality audio recordings of Taking Care, I think, go to prove my point. We have them. But no one, it seems, has the time and \u00a0interest to listen to them and transcribe them... so they stay unavailable. You could put them on SoundCloud without transcription, but I doubt many people would play them and engage with their content. Whereas I got in touch with Luca from Dynamoscopio, armed with my written notes, and we agreed to do a post on Mercato Lorenteggio in English together. We will publish, probably,\u00a0it next week.\u00a0\n\nIn fairness, though, there <em>are</em>\u00a0people who like audio.\u00a0@trythis is one of them.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-12-15 21:25:27", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:44.567940", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 366, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [29384], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7759, "user_id": 3293, "topic_id": 694, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Good luck with finding the budget!</b>\n\nHello Laurent, thanks for sharing your story, really interesting to read about the inside of a collective that i hear a lot about in the last couple of years.

I don't know if anybody else has had experience with that kind of thing.\n\n\u201cBasically it's looking at community spaces, vacant potential community spaces across rural areas that can be used to maybe put in high speed, quality broadband and desks and facilities for local people in more rural parts of the country to be able to utilize and use rather than having to travel to cities or bigger towns. \n\n\u201cThat's slightly different. It is more voluntary, that could be from local football clubs or different types of locations that are willing to collaborate. But it presents different challenges as opposed to more larger professionally run hubs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the big thing though, is to make sure voluntary or not that government, local community hubs, local kind of chambers of commerce that people are aligned and connected in some way in terms of how they work so that nobody's reinventing the wheel, or are trying to do something in the community when there's already a small hub, maybe around the corner, that they did not know about.\n\n\u201cThis kind of lack of communication and connectivity can be a major barrier to real, proper local development in community. So, I think the challenge for myself and people like X and lots of us is to make sure that we're aware of what's going on and offer supports and collaboration and help\u201d\n\n## An example from Scotland\n\n\u201cWe opened a co working place in 2005 and we've been working with the social innovation community in Edinburgh and around Scotland for the last, well, 15 years. \n\n\u201cOne of the things that we're doing, I'm just speaking to some of the points that have been raised, is working with voluntary organizations. So, third sector organizations to create coworking hubs in their local community. I've been evangelizing about let's get coworking into rural smaller towns, secondary towns, commuter towns for years, and the Scottish government invested in us to help share our knowledge and expertise with other people.\n\n\u201cAnd all of that information and services and products is available on our coworkingaccelerator.network websites. But we've got stories of people opening coworking hubs in small, rural secondary towns all over the world that we've been helping. I think the issue that they've got at the moment is just numbers of bums on seats. And when are the bums going to come back onto the seats and how long is their lifeline? Because most of us know the bigger the space you've got, the more money you can earn, maybe the more rent that you pay. Lots of voluntary organizations have taken on community assets, are living in Scotland. So there's lots of that going on around the place, taking on very large properties for a voluntary organization as a community asset, but how can they afford to keep them going when, well certainly in Scotland, we're not even open for business yet.\u201d\n\n## Numbers game \n\u201cI think that one of the things we see in coworking, there is a definite break. It's been a subject of conversation for a long time. There's a break in coworking, how you approach coworking in any town under 50,000 people, and in any town above 50,000 people. Above 50,000 people, honestly the model is pretty clear. It's fairly straightforward and it's not that difficult.\n\n\u201cUnder 50,000, you're talking about custom work. You're talking about a very different kettle of fish. It can be done. I'm presently in a conversation with some people about\u2026 they want to open a coworking space in an old cloister, like a 14th century cloister, which I'm extremely excited about if it goes there, but the town around it has pretty much been subject to quite a lot of what the Dutch called cramp, which is that everyone's moved away. I think the town around it is not 2000. \n\n\u201cI find that the key in small places is really to find out... The thing about small towns under 50,000 is that both communities and micro-communities already exist. So the idea that you're going to build a community in your coworking space is an entire waste of your time and really has unfortunate overtones of colonialism and I'm not going there. I don't dare. \n\n\u201cThose people have their communities, they've had them for a long time, pretty often what they want out of coworking spaces is to get out of them, to get away from them, because there's something lovely and cozy about a community where everybody's known you since you were a kid, but there's also a downside to that.\n\n\u201cThe smaller communities you have to find out, you have to know what the communities are that are there and what it is that they need, and then you serve them. I really think one of the things I say a lot is, you have to know who you are, you have to know who you're for, why are you there, and you have to know what those people sort of want and need and get it to them.\u201d\n...\n## If you have any thoughts on how coworking spaces in a smaller town should be different from a larger town or city, we would love to hear them.

And of course we agree, and no one ever tried to make Edge structureless. It is about making structures that work for those who need to use them. Adding new structure instead of fixing the existing one leads to org rot: the harmony fragments into a mosaic of islands that make some internal sense, but then cannot move forward because they need external output. Right now, in the RezNet I am hearing @nadia saying \"I can't engage because I was not given evidence from the coding in year 1\" and Jan saying \"OK, but now we need the engagement to get better material to code\". I do not recommend you guys go off into any more rabbithole, especially at this point.\n\nAdditionally, there is major issue with having regular calls in a fluid working reality: Alice agrees now to having meetings with Bob on the second Thursday of every month. Right now, her calendar is empty: no problem. But next month she might struggle to accommodate some other important meeting; or be on holiday; or be in the flow of writing some piece of text, and knows that stopping for the meeting is going to cost a lot in terms of concentration (I experience the latter a lot).\n\nBut, here is an alternative solution that (a) builds capacity in the team and (b) re-uses existing structure:\n\n1. Make a (one-time, for now) training for CMs on how to use network tools. I mean, how could I be against such use? My Ph.D. thesis is called *The management of online communities. A social networks perspective*! A lot can be accomplished simply by using Graphryder. I also have created, documented and published [a Tulip perspective to create rapid social networks](https://github.com/albertocottica/discourse-social-networks) *exactly* with the idea that then CMs would target all the \"singleton\" nodes that have zero connections, without having to tamper with fragile updating of GraphRyder. I even used to produce lists of those, but then I stopped in early 2020, after the mess with Natalia etc. A training would empower CMs to explore the network under their own powers.\n \n2. Make these observations part of the bi-weekly meetings. I don't expect a firehose of novelty. Observations like [this](/t/14458/14) do not come every week, and even when they do they could well be part of reporting into the bi-weekly. If a longer discussion is needed, we schedule one on demand, but do not make it a new ongoing commitment.\n\n3. In general, I would rather invest on the bi-weekly. Let's put there everything by default. Let's make it more juicy and fun. And let's keep it trans-projects, within the ethics of maximizing mutual learning. Activities that need their own space and do not involve everyone (like coding) override the default and result in their own meetings, as always. \n\nWhat say you?", "created_at": "2020-09-30 15:34:27.114430", "updated_at": "2020-09-30 15:34:27.114430", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 521, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 27.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [84029], "is_reply_to": [84029], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 58176, "user_id": 4022, "topic_id": 10568, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Great job, and warm regards.

This kind of thing is not terribly sophisticated once you buy into the network analysis idea. But you do need the data, and they need to be _network_ data.

I think it suits our style at Edgeryders very well. \n\nIt's called an AMA -- \"Ask Me Anything\". For those Redditors out there, this will be very familiar. If this is new, you can read about them here: https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/wiki/index\nExample: [I'm Adam Bandt, Leader of the Australian Greens. AMA about the 2020 Budget, the path out of the COVID recession, and the Green New Deal!](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/j76tqv/im_adam_bandt_leader_of_the_australian_greens_ama/)\n\nThe way it works is that we schedule a date and time for someone to be on the platform -- say for two hours, from 6-8pm on Friday October 16. They post a provocation/introduction: Hi, I'm Amelia Hassoun. I work on Smart Cities. Ask Me Anything! Usually the post also includes a paragraph of information to generate questions around a specific topic. For example, I could post a shortened version of my talk on Citizen Participation. For Adam Bandt, it was this:\n\n> The government's handed down its 2020 budget, and boy, it's a doozy. Great if you're a big corporation or a millionaire; but if you're out of work and relying on public services, you're shit outta luck. \nThis could have been a budget of hope \u2013 instead, it was one that gave tax cuts to millionaire and public money to the Liberals coal and gas donors, while further fuelling insecure low paid work.\nAt a time when we're in a once-in a lifetime recession, this budget makes all the wrong choices. It's a middle finger to the millions of people who are unemployed or under-employed right now, including more than half a million young people, and could create a lost generation.\nThe Greens have got another plan - for a green recovery that creates hundreds of thousands of good jobs, ensures everyone has an income they can live on and creates a strong, clean economy by investing in the care economy, education, affordable housing, renewables and sustainable infrastructure. You can check it out [here](https://greens.org.au/recovery).\nWe'll keep fighting for a green recovery, and push to block the Liberals plan with everything we've got. AMA about the government's budget, our plan, or how we fix politics and the world in general.\n\nThen we tell people about it -- hey, this person will be on at this time, come ask them questions! It happens on platform -- they respond in real time, for as long as they can stay on. And the conversation continues after the fact when interested parties stick around, to talk even when the speaker has left (and often the speaker comes back to answer more questions asynchronously). \n\nBenefits -- it generates a rich conversation in real time, creating a lot of text around a focused topic. This is better than an interview because a) no one has to transcribe it and b) the community themselves are doing the interviewing. \n\nAnd worst case scenario, if no one but our core team show up for some reason, we still have a rich interview with someone already transcribed onto the platform into chunks that are very amenable to SSNA coding. \n\nWhat do you think, @MariaEuler @johncoate @Leonie @katejsim @alberto @nadia @noemi? \n\nI'm happy to be the guinea pig for this -- or we could go back to the idea we had a few months ago and do an AMA with someone among one of our consortium partners. Ideally we do these with a wide range of community members, each experts in their own right :) And we could schedule these to happen on a biweekly basis, even.

I actually imagine it like a compass to indicate the desired direction to follow, but with the freedom and flexibility to adjust if sometimes there is no ideal option. What do you think about that?\n\nFor the second part, maybe we can start talking about travels.

Moreover, choosing transport companies who are working on their sustainability policy, compensating emissions, for example, or updating their vehicles or using less polluting fuels. \n\nThe same thing could be done in choosing the hotel/house we stay in during the travel.

With reports of a million Uyghurs in detention, plus censorship, surveillance and a blackout on outside communication, it\u2019s hard to know what\u2019s happening. But some TikTok users have started using the app to share visual clues about life under Xinjiang surveillance. That\u2019s why international Uyghur activists are digging deep into TikTok & similar apps. They\u2019ve found videos that show China\u2019s ongoing destruction of Uyghur and other Muslim architecture, checkpoints with long lines of Uyghurs waiting to go through, and videos of crying people in front of pictures of their relatives. Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, is behind China\u2019s firewall. To gain entry, international Uyghur activists have to use Chinese phones. To find compromising content from Xinjiang TikTok, the Uyghur activists \u201cgame\u201d the app\u2019s algorithm, which serves them content according to how they respond to each video. Searching isn\u2019t an option. Location-based TikTok search results are cleaned up by moderators. But still, videos make it through, and are downloaded by the activists and then reshared on other social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook, so they don't disappear.

In short, the project aims to redefine the roles of citizens (especially shop owners and customers on wheelchairs) in finding solutions for accessability of shops. It's technology, but also dialogue, design, but also awarenes, standards and overall people taking collective decisions.

They\u2019d be billed a monthly fee based on how many users they have. As a result, Darcy moderators would react to reports coming from this instance.\n[/quote]\n\nInteresting enough, this is the complete opposite of some of the first subject moderation instances that was fully monetized - i.e. that of the AOL Chat Rooms in the early 1990's.\n\nWe had a friend who was 14 years old and he was mod of the \"teen forum\" - he made 30K per year from doing so! AOL actually paid for him to come down to the VA. HQ for a sit down with other mods and admins.\nOf course, that ended soon enough when AOL couldn't charge 10 cents a minute for access to their digital world.\n\nIn our case (our forums), the mods were all volunteers but since we made some $$ from ads and sponsorships I paid them in later years with stipends and bonuses. \n\nI think one main point is that a model has to be built on something which is already proven somewhere (human interaction has not really changed). What people will pay for is likely the same as always, as well as what they will not. Also, how they will act if they pay for something (ownership) comes into play, as do regional and national differences. \n\nI have to also agree with most of what trythis says about the different goals of users vs. mods- or, in fact, the differing goals of each user. Although most mods start out as users they usually rise above the fray based on merit, not on pay. One can only imagine if FB allowed people to pay $10 a month to start a \"more special group\"....that many of those people would feel they were Kings and Queens of their little domain. As it stands many seem to feel this way just because they started a \"page\". This is, in fact, one of the largest problems of Social Media...that of thinking they are special because they have a page or the like. Ah, Human Nature. \n\nI wish I had all the answers - but perhaps Social Media is more like Movies and Documentaries where the \"moderators\" can be, in a sense, the creators (curators) and therefore rewarded (paid) as opposed to the opposite. It's not so different....the users pay for their streaming services (internet service, netflix, etc.) and the money funnels up to the content creators and curators.\n\nThis would be near impossible but a tiny tax on internet service which could be used for certain types of social media (akin to community TV and Radio which they already DO fund) would be ideal. But in todays world....that is a non-starter, IMHO, for many reasons.\n\nDefinitely brainstorming here, but maybe $$ from the good ole billionaires who truly want to see a more just and civil world is part of the answer? They fund Public Radio and TV here in the USA and this could be, in a sense, sold as something similar.\n\nI don't see a lot of mention of Reddit here - and, yes, they have their problems, but there is some things they do right in terms of balance.", "created_at": "2019-06-20 14:08:58.971599", "updated_at": "2019-06-20 14:10:41.842613", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 567, "wiki": false, "reads": 27, "score": 15.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [55420], "is_reply_to": [55420], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10801, "user_id": 2362, "topic_id": 3772, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>thanks!</b>\n\nHi Noemi!\n\nAt the moment it's unsure as to whether <a href=\"/u/jun\">@jun</a> will be joining us as he's away working in DRC on another project and wasn't sure if he'd be able to contribute sufficiently.

These are my notes from the workshop. Katja and Harry, please add what I have missed and correct what I might have misunderstood.\n\nTrustmarks are nothing new, they exist for everything from fair-trade for food to energy efficiency for domestic appliances. They exist because, without them, ethical technologies are hard to find. It's a fragmented marketplace and there is a lack of coordination. NGI has an opportunity to address that by developing a Trustmark, and this workshop was one step in that direction.\n\nOf course, defining \"ethical\" is no easy feat. Things to be considered could be privacy, fairness, bias, sustainability, security and countless other factors. There are many open questions, and this workshop did not aim to limit the scope but was rather an open exploration of the topic.\n\nWe know that there is some appetite for data protection trustmarks. One participant quoted a figure stating that 67% of consumers would like for such a certification to exist. But data protection is only one aspect of ethical data-driven technology, and the consumer appetite for other consideration is unclear. \n\nIn a way, terms of service are like very long and opaque trustmarks for what companies may do with your data. However, as we know, they are close to useless from a consumer perspective as a tool to compare technologies. One sort of trustmark could focus on making sure that terms of services live up to certain standards and include respectful defaults.\n\nGDPR has also become something of a trustmark, being used as shorthand when talking about data protection. What makes it effective is that there is accountability. As one participant said: \"You are trusted because you are accountable\".\n\nThis workshop did not go into detail, but we managed to write down some interesting opportunities and challenges of developing a trustmarks.\n\n### Opportunities \n\n* It creates a branding for ethical product, creating a virtuous circle where you must be certified to compete.\n* You can start creating new products based on being certified ethical, much like some lines of washing machines have as their unique selling point to be energy efficient.\n* Companies can account for what value consumers are giving up to get something for free. Facebook and its ilk would then have to be very upfront about its business model during signup. \n* A well-designed mark can become a strong marketing tool, by making the mark itself a brand.\n* A certifying body could include individual consumers who are, as a group, given equal weight to the industry. \n* AI bias is difficult because reducing bias often decreases accuracy. AI bias could be addressed by requiring companies to be upfront about what trade-offs they have accepted and how their AIs are biased. This is much like how human bias (internalized racism, sexism, etc) is addressed by becoming aware of one's own bias. \n* Sustainability, security and ethics of data centers could be certified by independent observers, similar to UN polling observants.\n\n### Challenges \n\n*  A trust mark with high standards might not work, if every single data giant ends up with a bad rating, trustmark might come across as too punitive\n* Privacy might be the easy part of the certification, but fairness will be harder. Addressing AI bias and error is harder.\n*  Where would such a trustmark be placed? How would you see it?\n*  If the trustmarks becomes something that one \"pays a premium\" for, will privacy and ethical tech become even more of an elite privilege? \n*  Who pays to certify open source software?\n*  Entrenched business models will lobby against it.\n*  It can easily become a barrier for entry for startups if not done right.\n\nAt the end of the workshop, participants were asked to name one thing that they though a trustmark must cover. These were some answers (I didn't catch everything):\n* Transparency: A non-technical person must be able to understand in a reasonable time frame, for what purpose and how is it collected and used? Steps forward for the commission would be to look at existing best practice for sustainability trustmarks in particular. \n* People don't know how their data is being used, and the next step is to make those who break trust pay.\n* Simplicity and usability of the mark are key.\n* Create respectful defaults. One such concrete default would be to always have a user accessible off-switch for the AI.

You could have an application, lets call it SimplePost, that is able to cross post (through your cryptographic signatures) both into the SSB blob and some Holochain local chain and DHT. \n\nYou could also authorize an SSB application to request data from say your Holochain contact book by simply opening the \"API\" of the Holochain application to allow it (authorizing the keys of the application requesting). I write API in quotations since, in my understanding, good Holochain design is based on separating the UIs and data layer of all the Holochain applications so that we can create UIs that utilize many different DHTs for richer applications. Through that design, all data function calls are effectively APIs and just as accessible from, for instance, an SSB application as from a simple localhost webapp (using things like websockets).\n\nAs for currencies and Holochain that is a bit of a rabbit hole. This whole thing grew out of the meta-currency project and there is some pretty deep and heady [material](http://metacurrency.org/portfolio-item/deep-wealth-a-post-monetary-jazz-ensemble/) on what Holochain is trying to enable in this space. \n\nBut as a short reply, yes, one of the reasons why Holochain has focused so much energy on creating peer-validating functions and temper-proofing local chains of entries is that it sets the stage for super simple implementation of currency. \n\nCurrencies on Holochain would not require tokens or mining but are a way of issuing credit to one another which is then a circulating supply. This can be done within applications, but are possibly better thought of as micro-services usable by any application you have installed. Currency is a simple app. And as all other apps, the UI could weave it into another app. \n\nSay for instance a carsharing application. The application that is keeping track of car usage and maintenance costs can call into the carpool credit application and shift credit from one user to another. Maybe the carpool credit application can also be the tool library credit application, all that requires is using it in both apps.\n\nI don't know if that makes things clearer @zelf, if not, please help me clarify where I am confusing, I'm happy to exercise and grow my understanding like that. :smile:", "created_at": "2019-05-14 21:15:46.397579", "updated_at": "2019-05-14 21:15:46.397579", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 424, "wiki": false, "reads": 27, "score": 110.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [53497], "is_liked_by": [2915, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 58798, "user_id": 5336, "topic_id": 10685, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Dzie\u0144 dobry wszystkim \n\nChcia\u0142am poruszy\u0107 temat braku r\u00f3\u017cnorodno\u015bci (kulturowej, rasowej, religijnej itd) w Polsce.

And they struggle to fight the control back.\n\nWe are going to meet them, to get their stories, And to share them. There will be a website and a documentary. And perhaps a lot of follow-ups.\n\nFor this project we are partnering with <a href=\"http://p2pfoundation.net/Greexit_Project\" target=\"_blank\">P2P Foundation</a>, an organisation focused on promoting P2P and the Commonns paradigms. The schedule is as follows:\n\n1. 24th of May 2013 (right after the Commons-related conference in Berlin) I am hitchhiking due south - via Venice to Greece (by sea). Plan is to reach Athens, meet our P2P Foundation partners and run a series of meetings with interested parties in Athens, Thessaloniki and smaller towns/villages. They will be shortlisted for autumn tour. During the research I will gather preliminary material to set up a website for the whole project - the \"making of\" style, focused on bringing attention and crowdfunding.\n\n2. During the summer we shall set up full-blown website with videostreaming, podcasting, telepresence and anything we can get the funding for.\n\n3. In autumn (perhaps September/October, considering the weather and tourist season), a team of 3 people will get on the car and start the cruise. It is now expected to last 6 weeks, which means we can cover ~10 places, running live internet show and gathering material for the documentary. The live road show will include (bandwidth permitting) live video stream, videocasts and telechats with hosting communities. Also crowdfunding for the documentary production, based on the material gathered during the tour.\n\n4. Once back from the tour, we shall prepare the said documentary, hoping to put it into circulation worldwide. We shall also keep the website alive, to let people learn how the unRevolution advances.\n\nPetros", "created_at": "2013-02-18 09:32:14", "updated_at": "2018-06-17 00:27:30.168358", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 343, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 10.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33481, "user_id": 3645, "topic_id": 6258, "post_number": 21, "raw": "<b>Re: more info</b>\n\nCool!\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-07-18 17:01:57", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:04.282734", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 9, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 11.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [33480], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}]
